9325,waste from livestock farms including manure is a significant source of estrogenic pollutants in the environment these wastes have complex matrices necessitating the implementation of in vivo and in vitro tests in order to investigate their estrogenic effects however most current in vivo methods are limited by the toxic effect of livestock waste due to their high concentrations of organic matter here we propose a novel in vivo microinjection method which is able to avoid this limitation in this study the estrogen content of slurry based irrigation water extracts from dairy cattle farms was examined using a classical in vitro and the newly developed in vivo method the limitations of the in vitro system with its absence of endogenous steroid hormone receptors and subsequent lack of elucidating complex interactions involving the estrogen receptor er are complemented by the in vivo fish test which allows for a more complete assessment of estrogenicity and toxicity to vertebrate animals in vitro screenings were performed with the iso 19040 1 2018 yeast estrogen screen yes the yes test showed estrogenic activity in all 32 tested samples which ranged from 5 to 50518 ng l in eeq e2 estradiol equivalents the in vivo microinjection method was developed using a tg vtg1 mcherry transgenic zebrafish embryo model this model is able to eliminate secondary symptoms of hypoxia that may occur during normal aqueous exposure to high organic matter extracts using the microinjection method a total of 12 samples out of the 32 samples examined presented no observable estrogenic effects in fish embryos based on integrated density values in samples where the fish test showed no estrogenic effect the liver of the larvae was significantly damaged due to sample toxicity our results clearly show that the combination of these methods provides a highly effective screening tool for samples containing high concentrations of organic matter graphical abstract ga1 keywords irrigation

introduction xenoestrogens or endocrine disrupting compounds edc are widely present in our environment and exposure to them can have serious consequences for wildlife and humans adeel et al 2017 mills and chichester 2005 sumpter 2005 estrogenic substances have several adverse effects such as disturbing the hormonal system reducing the efficiency of the immune system causing developmental disorders and the most common negative effect is dysfunction of the reproductive system which can lead to reduced fertility and changes in sexual behavior carnevali et al 2018 kavlock and ankley 1996 söffker and tyler 2012 zhou et al 2009 agricultural wastes are a source of natural and synthetic steroid estrogens as well as other estrogenic compounds several studies have demonstrated the presence of farm animal derived steroid hormones in manure and wastewater from dairy farms hanselman et al 2006 2003 kjær et al 2007 lafrance and caron 2013 natural steroidal estrogen hormones are excreted in the urine and feces of all species sexes and classes of farm animals therefore livestock wastes are potential sources of edc in the environment adeel et al 2017 hanselman et al 2006 2003 agricultural manure waste is useful for agricultural landowners who use it as nutrient for plants manure is usually spread on soil surfaces or more recently injected to meet the nutrient requirements of plants as well as positively influence soil structure humus content water air and heat management amin et al 2014 das et al 2017 however the estrogen load associated with these substances and agricultural areas may pose a risk to plants terrestrial organisms aquatic organisms and to humans through the food chain within the manure including liquid manure slurry there are many types of estrogens and conjugated estrogens in dairy cattle e1 17alpha e2 and 17beta e2 secretions have been detected in faeces and urine in their parent compound forms as well as in their conjugated e1 sulphate and e2 alpha glucuronide forms hanselman et al 2006 2003 johnson et al 2006 the chemical diversity of these estrogenic substances makes the testing of their presence difficult as different analytical methods are required for their detection sumpter 2005 this is further complicated by the fact that these substances are mostly in the form of complex mixtures in the environment adeel et al 2017 sumpter 2005 effect based screening methods offer a solution to this problem such as the use of biomonitor bioindicator organisms fetter et al 2014 gorelick and halpern 2011 routledge and sumpter 1996 sanseverino et al 2008 due to the diversity of estrogenic substances and the complexity of the endocrine system there are a lot of potential mechanisms of action e g genomic and non genomic pathways and autocrine paracrine signaling networks that may be susceptible to the adverse effects of endocrine disruptors kiyama and wada kiyama 2015 mueller 2004 zacharewski 1998 because of these complexities the use of a multilevel approach for complementary in vivo and in vitro assays is essential to test the estrogenic activity of a substance or a complex sample beresford et al 2000 jarque et al 2016 zacharewski 1998 their combination and use is even recommended by oecd and the epa as well huet 2000 fenner crisp et al 2000 additionally the european water framework directive wfd aims to identify potential effect based tools e g biomarkers and bioassays and implement them for the monitoring and assessment of the quality of surface water bodies könemann et al 2018 wernersson et al 2015 genetically modified saccharomyces cerevisiae strains are in vitro tools that are routinely used for environmental monitoring including measuring estrogenic effects and they play an important role in the identification and first screening of estrogenic compounds that interact with estrogen receptors routledge and sumpter 1996 sanseverino et al 2008 these yeast based in vitro eukaryotic systems are cost effective tools that allow for the rapid screening of a large number of compounds or mixtures in solvents payne et al 2000 viganò et al 2008 native aqueous samples hettwer et al 2018 and concentrated environmental samples e g solid phase extracts spe bistan et al 2012 zhao et al 2009 the yes screen has many advantages over other systems including the absence of endogenous steroid hormone receptors and a consequent lack of complex interactions between the estrogen receptor er and other receptors however their limitations such as being unable to model complex physiological processes in an organism e g biotransformation pharmacokinetics or to detect hormone sensitive phases of different life stages may result in unreliable predictions kunz et al 2006 zacharewski 1998 among vertebrates the role of fish in environmental risk assessment is significant as aquatic organisms are particularly affected by edc contamination mills and chichester 2005 sumpter 2005 their endocrine system and physiological processes show strong similarities with other vertebrates including mammals hill et al 2005 therefore they are widely used to test for estrogenic substances and model their potential physiological effect bakos et al 2019 mills and chichester 2005 sumpter 2005 recently several estrogen sensitive biosensor lines have been created using laboratory fish models such as zebrafish danio rerio abdelmoneim et al 2019 bakos et al 2019 chen et al 2010 gorelick and halpern 2011 tong et al 2009 the main advantage of zebrafish as a biosensor line is the transparent body of the embryos and larvae in our lab we have created a novel transgenic fluorescent vitellogenin zebrafish model tg vtg1 mcherry which allows for the fluorescent mcherry reporter signal to be easily studied in vivo upon exposure to estrognic substances without sacrificing the animal bakos et al 2019 tsang 2010 the testing of organic matter rich substances in fish especially in embryos can cause problems due to hypoxia in the test vessel which can lead to secondary effects that may interfere with the evaluation of the results küster and altenburger 2008 strecker et al 2011 microinjection is a simple way to introduce polar nonpolar or organic matter rich test substances into newly fertilized fish eggs or developing fish embryos colman et al 2004 mizell and romig 1997 schubert et al 2014 walker et al 1992 the results of microinjection are complex and it is not always possible to directly compare the results with classical acute and long term tests where embryos are exposed via waterborne exposure however microinjection is a good supplement option to conventional tests in certain cases such as the examination of complex samples with a high organic matter concentration schubert et al 2014 csenki et al 2019 the microinjection technique also allows for the delivery of very precise amounts of a material csenki et al 2019 shortly after microinjection the effects on embryonic development are visible and even minor toxic effects can be distinguished from background mortality and other sublethal symptoms schubert et al 2014 the distribution of the substance in the yolk is not always uniform so it can only be sure about the absorption of the total introduced substance if the total amount of the yolk disappears from the body of the embryos this happens at 165 12 hpf hours post fertilization in case of zebrafish litvak and jardine 2003 in the case of high organic matter containing samples the method can help to eliminate the secondary effects caused by hypoxia by placing the test substance directly into the body of the embryos and not into the fluid in the test vessel where decomposition processes can possibly begin which can reduce oxygen levels csenki et al 2019 before experiments depending on the test endpoints and test material several parameters of the method need to be optimized which is a relative disadvantage compared to the commonly used aquatic exposure and standardized test protocols csenki et al 2019 schubert et al 2014 these study use a vitellogenin reporter transgenic zebrafish line tg vtg1 mcherry whose properties must also be taken into account when designing the experiments the zebrafish liver where vitellogenin is also produced starts to develop 6 h after fertilization 6 hpf and begins to function after 50 h 50 hpf ober et al 2003 tao and peng 2009 due to the effect of estrogenic substances the liver is able to produce endogenous vitellogenin from the age of 2 3 days of an embryo chen et al 2010 similar and parallel synchronous to the endogenous vitellogenin the mcherry reporter is only expressed in the liver as well where the first stronger fluorescent signals are detected in the embryos at 72 h of age and then the signal strength and the size of the fluorescent area increase as the liver develops thus facilitating the evaluation of studies bakos et al 2019 in addition to the size and maturity of the liver the structural integrity of the liver also affects the intensity of fluorescent sign and the size of the area the cells of the embryos including their liver cells can be damaged by higher concentrations of toxic substances bakos et al 2013 2019 in that case the induction of vitellogenin production could be strongly decreased so this had to be taken into account in the design of the experiments besides embryos also have significant individual sensitivities which must be taken into consideration too when setting experimental numbers csenki et al 2020 waste from livestock farms has complex matrices and poses a significant challenge to achieve accurate measurement of estrogens and their effects however in vivo and in vitro effect directing methods are suitable to analyze the estrogenic potential of these complex samples noguera oviedo and aga 2016 in order to demonstrate the usefulness of a combined in vivo and in vitro study on agricultural waste our research was conducted at four dairy cattle farms which used a slurry management system we focused on determining the presence of estrogenic chemicals in the slurry using two models of estrogen detection the in vitro yes test yes yeast estrogen screen which provides a predictive value when possible human health effects need to be measured was used to monitor the quantitative changes of estrogenic substances in slurry the in vivo test utilized our estrogen sensitive tg vtg1 mcherry transgenic zebrafish embryos combined with a microinjection based method in order to avoid the inherent difficulties in testing organic matter rich samples this method enables a more complete assessment of estrogenicity and toxicity to vertebrate animals our aim was to develop a method that allows the transgenic fish model when used in combination with the yes test to detect estrogenicity in organic matter rich samples more accurately 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample origin site 1 k location komárom esztergom county hungary the average number of animals at the site consists of 1200 cows including 600 milking cows and 700 calves the calves are housed mainly in barns with rest boxes and there are also stables with deep litter recreation pits are regularly cleaned by rinsing and the wastewater is drained into a slurry storage tank this farm uses a separator in order to separate the liquid and solid parts of slurry the solid part is treated as manure the liquid part is stored in a pool continuously mixed with two high performance stirrers and then transferred to the fields on a regular basis site 2 v location pest county hungary the average number of animals at the site consists of 1800 cows including 1200 milking cows and 1500 calves the farm has deep littered stables the pre feeding area of the stables is cleaned three times a day the cleaned waste is drained into a storage tank where it is stirred together with the wastewater of the milking house washing system since there is no separator and the dry matter content of slurry is significant there are 4 high performance stirrers operating continuously in order to prevent sedimentation site 3 s location baranya county hungary the average number of animals at the site consists of 900 cows including 700 milking cows and 800 calves the farm has 50 deep littered stables and 50 barns with rest boxes recreation pits are regularly cleaned by rinsing and the wastewater drained into a slurry storage tank they use a separator machine for the separation of the liquid and solid parts of the slurry the solid part is treated as manure the liquid part is stored in a pool and continuously mixed with two high performance stirrers it is important to note that during the sampling the separator was out of order several times which means the samples contained increased dry matter content site 4 sz location somogy county hungary the average number of animals at the site consists of 2100 cows including 1400 milking cows and 1700 calves the farm has barns with rest boxes where automated manure cleaning equipment periodically clean the stables from the pits situated next to the barns automated pumps transmit the slurry to the slurry storage tank where the slurry is mixed with the wastewater of the milking house washing system the liquid and solid part is transferred and dispensed together to the fields anti inflammatory drugs antibiotics sex inducing and synchronising products are used regularly additionally parlour acid and or alkaline based chemicals for the disinfection of milking cows and trotter care products are applied at each farm on a monthly basis 2 2 yeast estrogen screen for the investigation of estrogenic effect four samples were taken from the fresh slurry storage pools where the slurry was usually stored for 30 days samples were taken each time from each edge of the pools 1 l each and then combined in all pools the slurry was mechanically mixed thus the samples were considered homogenous and representative they were collected in disposable sterile polypropylene 50 ml falcon tubes which were free of dnase rnase endotoxins and metals during the sampling we were careful to avoid using other plastic accessories samples were placed in the refrigerator at 4 c and processed within 4 6 days after sampling the samples were centrifuged in 50 ml falcon tubes for 20 min at a speed of 3900 rcf held at a constant temperature of 4 c samples including endocrine disrupting shemicals were extracted from the 30 ml supernatant using solid phase micro extraction spe first the extraction cartridge strata x 200 mg 6 ml from phenomenex usa was conditioned using a mixture of 8 ml methanol and 8 ml water at a 95 5 ratio completing a regular rinse with technical grade methanol solution in the second step 30 ml of liquid slurry supernatant was passed through the cartridge in the third step rinsing was performed with a mixture of 10 ml methanol water 1 1 and 10 ml acetone water 2 1 after a few minutes of drying the retained components were eluted in 5 ml methanol after elution 200 μl of sample was dissolved in 1800 μl methanol which was a 10 fold dilution then further 1 50 1 100 1 500 1 1000 1 5000 and 1 10 000 dilutions were prepared for yes testing two 2 grams of the sediment from centrifugation was mixed with 10 ml methanol and sonicated for 30 min at 30 c and then centrifuged for 10 min at 4 c at 2000 rpm velocity the supernatant was further diluted as in the liquid phase 1 10 1 10 000 and then used for additional testing the estrogenic activity of the sample extracts was evaluated using the recombinant yeast strain yes according to the protocol iso 1904 0 1 2018 iso 19040 the yes is a reporter gene assay which can be used for the measurement of the activation of the human estrogen receptor alpha herα in the presence of a sample containing compounds which cause estrogenic effects the test strain is derived from saccharomyces cerevisiae bj3505 protease deficient matα pep4 his3 prb 1 delta1 6 r his3 delta200 lys2 801 trp1 delta101 ura3 52gal2can1 this strain harbours two plasmids the plasmid yepe10 contains the cup1 her fusion which encodes the human estrogen receptor α cloned from the mcf 7 human cell lineage under the control of the metallothionein promoter cup1 this plasmid is selected via the tryptophane auxothropy of the parent strain the second plasmid is the reporter plasmid yrpeg3 which contains the fusion gene 2ere cyc1 lacz this fusion gene express the β galactosidase encoded by lacz under the control of the iso1cytochrom c promoter from s cerevisiae which is fused to two copies of the vitellogenina2 gene from xenopus laevis this plasmid is selected via the uracil auxothropy of the parent strain iso 19040 mcdonnell et al 1991 the yes test continuously produces the human estrogen receptor the estrogen receptor belongs to the family of nuclear hormone receptors when the yeast encounters estrogen or a homologous molecule it produces a β galactosidase enzyme β galactosidase catalyzes the hydrolysis of the galactoside analog chlorophenol red β d galactopyranoside cprg and converts the yellow orange cprg substrate into the red chromophore chlorophenol red yielding a dark red solution this was measured using a microplate reader at 580 nm to determine the amount of substrate converted the amount of estrogenic substances in the specified sample were given in relative estrogen activity or 17β estradiol e2 equivalents eeq ng l mcdonnell et al 1991 routledge and sumpter 1996 iso 19040 for the analysis of the estrogenic activity 10 μl aliquots of the sample extract were transferred to the wells of a sterilized 96 well optical flat bottom microtitre plate nunc germany and the solvent was allowed to evaporate until dry the wells were then supplied with 120 μl of the assay medium containing yeast cells and the covered plates were incubated at 30 c in an incubator plo eko aparatura for 1 day then 30 μl of each well of the test plate was transferred to a new 96 well plate and 50 μl reaction mixture containing cprg and lyticase was added the plates were then incubated for one more hour the colour development was measured at 580 nm and the turbidity of the yeast cell biomass was read at 620 nm labsystems multiskan ms in parallel each plate contained the concentrations of the standard

promoter sequence with a high number of ere estrogen responsive element sites the mcherry reporter is only produced in the liver similarly to endogenous vitellogenin the sensitivity and usability of the embryos of the line have been tested on several estrogenic compounds as well as on environmental samples bakos et al 2019 2 5 zebrafish maintenance and egg collection the laboratory bred tg vtg1

from three independent experiments in triplicate kruskal wallis followed by dunn s post hoc test was used the number of fluorescent embryos were compared to each other the establishment of a reliable cut off is of high importance to discriminate between responded and non responded individuals several standard methods have been proposed to choose optimal cut offs and all require known positive and negative tests to compute the cut off value that will best discriminate we adapted and applied a general formula from classen et al 1987 where cut off mean mean of the integrated density values of 3 independent negative control readings 3 sd the standard deviation of independent negative control readings classen et al 1987 lardeux et al 2016 thus an integrated density value above this value was

349 7 2019 3 results and discussion 3 1 results of the yeast estrogen screen field analysis yes tests were performed to determine the estrogenicity of the samples and to gain information for developing a fish assay based on our test results and the description of the iso 19040 standard sample extracts can also be made by solid phase extraction spe and show high 90 recovery for known xeno estrogens iso 19040 the limit of quantification loq of this method for the direct analysis of water samples is between 8 ng l and 15 ng l 17β estradiol equivalents eeq based on the results of the international interlaboratory trial the upper threshold of the dynamic range for this test is between 120 ng l and 160 ng l 17β estradiol equivalents eeq iso 19040 samples showing estrogenic potencies above this threshold were diluted for a valid quantification to determine the accuracy and precision of the assay 5 assay plates were individually tested with e2 standard at concentrations ranging from 2 ng l to 500 ng l in our laboratory the precision was above 90 and matched the requirements of the guidance for industry bioanalytical method validation of 80 cder and cvm 2018 the accuracy was 48 8 98 3 2 ng l 48 8 6 2 ng l 76 18 6 ng l 91 3 55 6 ng l 91 166 5 ng l 97 9 500 ng l 98 3 confidence levels 95 only concentrations between 18 6 and 500 ng l met the cder demands for an accuracy of 15 of the expected value during the study 2 samples from each site were tested four times with the liquid and solid phases remaining separate samples were collected from 4 dairy cattle farms with different characteristics in general all samples showed estrogenic activity based on the yes test the detailed results of the yeast estrogen screen are shown in fig 1 at k farm 5 15502 ng l eeq values were measured in the liquid phase and 70 2809 ng l in the solid phase the extremely broad range was due to the slurry separator used since elimination of solid parts reduces the edcs as a result of a purification process in the period from march to july there were outstanding values when the separator was out of order and unseparated slurry samples were tested in the case of v farm 462 7896 ng l estrogen activity was measured in the liquid and 252 6339 ng l in the solid phases while in the case of sz farm 864 3338 ng l eeq was measured in the liquid phase and 380 3242 ng l in the solid phase based on the results s farm had the highest estrogen activities 2583 50 518 ng l in the liquid phase and 858 3746 ng l in the solid phase transgenic yeast based assays including the yes test are excellent for the rapid and reliable testing of estrogenic activity in manure based containing samples however instead of direct testing of native samples testing of different extracts is recommended in this case the high organic matter content of native manure samples reduces the sensitivity of the yes test and may be cytotoxic to yeast which may also have a negative effect on test results holbrook et al 2005 parent compounds e1 17alpha e2 and 17beta e2 mean the main estrogenic substances in the manure which can be detected by the yes test the results obtained can be given as estrogen equivalent gadd et al 2010b schoenborn et al 2015 significant amounts of these compounds are excreted daily by farms 300 11400 µg d 1 fecal and 500 160000 µg d 1 urinary excretion per 1000 kg live animal mass the amount of estrogenic substances measured in manure shows high variability based in the literature on field studies reporting the concentration of estrogens up to 16500 ng l hanselman et al 2003 raman et al 2004 the actual estrogen release of a livestock farm can be affected by several factors e g the number of pregnant animals and the stage of pregnancy age mass diet season health status circadian variation hanselman et al 2006 johnson et al 2006 schoenborn et al 2015 therefore as our results show estrogen emissions within a site are not constant or may vary from site to site in commercial animal production systems faeces and urine are not collected and treated separately in most cases however they are often used in livestock farm s manure storage and treatment systems to control pathogens odor and nutrient loading to the environment alegbeleye and sant ana 2020 noguera oviedo and aga 2016 schoenborn et al 2015 these treatments e g solid liquid separation long term storage use of lagune systems aeration etc have varying degrees of ability to reduce the estrogenic effect of the manure gadd et al 2010a hutchins et al 2007 noguera oviedo and aga 2016 zheng et al 2008 on the sites examined in the study the selected treatment procedures did not eliminate the estrogen content of the manure however the separator was able to significantly reduce it the amounts of estrogenic compounds determined as estrogen equivalents in the yes test ranged from 5 ng l to 50 518 ng l for the four dairy farms the levels of estrogen detected in the yes test are substantially higher than the levels known to cause endocrine disruption in aquatic organisms e g sex ratio skewed toward females reversible vtg induction reduced egg production formation of ova testes in males etc adeel et al 2017 brion et al 2004 leet et al 2011 our results show that the level of estrogenicity in the tested manure samples was high enough to have a measurable effect on fish thus we began the next phase of our study using the fish embryo model 3 2 results of microinjection based fish embryo tests since this study consists of a method development and a field analysis part it will be presented separately in this section 3 2 1 method development prior to testing several factors had to be considered when designing the experiments because the primary goal in testing the samples on zebrafish embryos was to detect estrogenic activity an experimental design had to be found where the amount of samples injected would not cause any crucial organ damage in the individuals but contained enough estrogenic substances to induce a fluorescent signal in the liver during acute treatment to determine the droplet size used in the experiments a sample v3 liquid that was found to be highly toxic in the yeast experiment was injected since the amount of material injected has an upper limit at which the embryos are not damaged furthermore we did not have any preliminary results on the toxicity of the samples on zebrafish embryos the samples were further concentrated to achieve the smallest possible injection droplet size during sample concentration the acetone originally used was replaced with dmso because based on literature data more advanced embryos from 3 dpf appeared to tolerate this solvent better maes et al 2012 these sample treatments were performed on all samples tested and were used for further experiments in this study 3 different volumes of v3 sample were injected into the yolk of 3 day old embryos 0 074 nl droplet diameter 50 µm 1 02 nl 125 µm and 4 17 nl 200 µm v3 marked samples were treated with three injected volumes and then mortality was examined for 4 days for the first two days there was no difference in mortality results between treatments however 72 h after injection the mortality data 0 074 and 1 02 nl p 0 05 0 074 and 4 17 nl p 0 01 1 02 and 4 17 nl p 0 01 were significantly different on the fourth day after injection there was essentially no death among the smallest injected individuals in the case of 1 02 nl treatment only half of the embryos 51 67 7 64 survived while at the highest injected dose 28 67 5 51 of the individuals were alive no mortality occurred between control non injected individuals data not shown based on these results the samples were later injected with the smallest tested volume 0 074 nl fig 2a the length of exposure time was determined using the average amount of estrogen equivalent calculated from the original non concentrated samples in the yeast test 3000 ng l e2 which was injected into 3 day old embryos with the lowest amount 0 074 nl as determined in the previous test the number of individuals showing a fluorescent signal was monitored daily for 4 days after treatment it is clear from the results that the number of embryos exhibiting a fluorescent signal was increasing over time post injection fig 2b there were embryos as early as 24 h post treatment in which a fluorescent signal could be observed in the liver 3 33 2 89 a significant increase in the number of fluorescent embryos first occurred 72 h after injection by that time 38 33 5 77 of the embryos produced fluorescent protein expression on the last day of the 96 hour study period the previous day s value doubled to 80 4 10 22 based on these results this time point was chosen as the end of post injection exposures in further experiments 3 2 2 field analysis based on the protocol established in the method development section liquid and sediment phase slurry samples collected from 4 sites at 4 different time points were examined on transgenic zebrafish embryos according to the developed microinjection and evaluation protocol regarding the tested manure samples the number of surviving larvae was sufficient for integrated density studies estrogen positive samples were found for all sites both from the liquid and sediment phases based on the transgenic fish model fig 3 there was a 62 5 correspondence between the yeast and fish test results indicating estrogenic effects of the samples out of the 32 samples examined a total of 12 samples did not show estrogenic effects in the fish embryo studies based on integrated density values from the liquid phase only one of the k and one of the v site samples was found to be non estrogenic samples k1 and v3 however k1 k3 s4 v2 v4 and sz1 sediment phase samples were estrogenic integrated density values showed high variation within each treatment the differences in individual sensitivity mentioned above were much more significant in the case of irrigation water samples compared to individual active ingredients due to the large standard deviations commonly used statistical methods did not seem to be suitable for determining estrogenicity therefore data were first evaluated by the kruskal wallis analysis with dunn s multiple comparisons test data not shown but despite the fact that many of the treated embryos were visually observable and showed clear fluorescence in the liver the test gave negative results in several cases the cut off formula classen et al 1987 lardeux et al 2016 seemed to be much more suitable for evaluating the results since in this case estrogenicity was in agreement with the visually observed fluorescence examining the results further it is apparent that for some samples the integrated density results were of a lower value than the control integrated density results 9 274 0 7403 an explicit decrease was observed only in the case of sediment samples s2 0 02429 0 01991 s3 0 03094 0 02778 sz2 0 06967 0 07831 sz4 0 06502 0 08568 vitellogenin production in embryos was determined by developmental stage and the structural integrity of the liver bakos et al 2019 csenki et al 2020 faisal et al 2020 representative images of the livers of the embryos clearly show that in cases where integrated density values were considerably lower the shape and size of the liver differed from the control suggesting that the liver is sensitive to exposure fig 4 the reduced liver size could be due to liver inflammation degeneration or necrosis which can also be confirmed by the characteristic liver color change he et al 2013 wolf and wheeler 2018 zhang et al 2016 these effects may reduce or prevent the appearance of the fluorescent signal and may indicate hepatotoxic properties of the tested sample despite the fact that the sample may have an estrogenic effect based on the yes test as can be seen from the results in samples where a significant fluorescent signal was observed the liver of the embryos did not show a considerable difference compared to the control so it can be assumed that these samples had low toxicity to the embryos numerous studies in the literature show that estrogen contamination of waterways is a concern due to the presence of these chemicals which among other pathologies can adversely affect the reproductive biology of aquatic wildlife including fish brion et al 2004 hanselman et al 2003 leet et al 2011 mills and chichester 2005 sumpter 2005 the real estrogenic effect of manure released into the environment is influenced affected by several factors e g the relative proportion and amount of estrogenic compounds water solubility half life of chemicals biotransformation and biodegradation of microorganisms interactions with other edc compounds the properties of soil and water bodies environmental and climatic conditions etc adeel et al 2017 biswas et al 2013 khan and lee 2012 ma et al 2016 yang et al 2021 in addition manure also contains a number of other compounds that do not necessarily have hormonal effects however through their toxic effects they may also affect vitellogenin production as can be seen from our results 3 3 combined results in summary the microinjection method developed for tg vtg1 mcherry embryos was shown to be suitable for studying the estrogenic effect of liquid and sediment manure samples extracts prepared for yes tests after solvent exchange were appropriate for injection experiments so extracts were not needed to be prepared separately for the two methods the embryo test gave a definitive yes no answer to the estrogenic effect of the sample however the duration of the test was significantly longer than for the yes test using the two methods in combination provides a highly effective screening approach where the results of the rapid yes test are complementary to the valuable data from the new in vivo test method enabling a more complete assessment of estrogenicity and toxicity however results of long term and acute toxicological tests are not comparable directly with the results of the microinjection method the aim of this work was to develop a screening method that is able to determine if a particular sample may pose estrogenic risk when placed into the environment this method allows for the quick and efficient detection of the estrogenic activity of organic matter rich samples which are difficult or unable to be tested by conventional aquatic tests 4 conclusions waste from livestock farms including manure is one of the most significant sources of estrogenic pollutants in the environment these wastes have complex matrices so complementary in vivo and in vitro tests are needed in order to investigate their true estrogenic effects transgenic models are highly beneficial such that in this study an in vivo and an in vitro transgenic model were used to examine manure samples from four dairy cattle farms with different characteristics the estrogenicity of the samples was determined by the two test methods and the correlation of the two models was explored the first in vitro screenings were performed with a classical yes test using a genetically modified saccharomyces cerevisiae model based on the results of the yes test a new test method was developed for a tg vtg1 mcherry transgenic zebrafish embryo model where exposure was carried out by microinjection which eliminated secondary symptoms of hypoxia that may occur during normal aqueous exposure to high organic matter extracts the yes test results were positive for all samples tested regardless of whether the sample came from the liquid or sediment phase the eeq values detected by the yes test consistent with the literature data indicated orders of magnitude that could already pose a potential environmental risk due to the high sensitivity of the embryos the fish test in contrast to the yes test was able to give primarily only yes no answers when detecting the estrogenic effect the overlap between the results of the two methods was 62 5 in terms of estrogen detection however as a complex organism the zebrafish embryo test was also suitable for the detection of any sublethal organ specific toxicity of samples primarily hepatoxicity complementing the results of the yes test combined the results obtained by the yes and fish tests are more relevant from the environmental perspective as interactions between chemicals are detected and these could have a higher predictive value when possible effects need to be determined several international organizations oecd epa recommend the use of complementary in vivo and in vitro methods for various toxicological ecotoxicological tests using the advantages of biomarker based monitoring and other effect based methods is increasingly becoming the focus of research in these areas the integration of such tools in addition to existing methods is also supported promoted by the eu water framework directive wfd as this can significantly improve its biomonitoring strategy the inclusion of the method combination presented in the study may be an alternative to be used by the wfd for the examination of special samples with high organic matter content the use of these combined methods can help with the risk management of water utilization the economical application of the water to minimize treat monitor and control the probability or impact of unfortunate events and support environmental protection additionally these methods can provide assistance in the development of technologies and methods that reduce the effects of estrogenic compounds to the environment credit authorship contribution statement zsolt csenki conceptualization formal analysis funding acquisition

9325,waste from livestock farms including manure is a significant source of estrogenic pollutants in the environment these wastes have complex matrices necessitating the implementation of in vivo and in vitro tests in order to investigate their estrogenic effects however most current in vivo methods are limited by the toxic effect of livestock waste due to their high concentrations of organic matter here we propose a novel in vivo microinjection method which is able to avoid this limitation in this study the estrogen content of slurry based irrigation water extracts from dairy cattle farms was examined using a classical in vitro and the newly developed in vivo method the limitations of the in vitro system with its absence of endogenous steroid hormone receptors and subsequent lack of elucidating complex interactions involving the estrogen receptor er are complemented by the in vivo fish test which allows for a more complete assessment of estrogenicity and toxicity to vertebrate animals in vitro screenings were performed with the iso 19040 1 2018 yeast estrogen screen yes the yes test showed estrogenic activity in all 32 tested samples which ranged from 5 to 50518 ng l in eeq e2 estradiol equivalents the in vivo microinjection method was developed using a tg vtg1 mcherry transgenic zebrafish embryo model this model is able to eliminate secondary symptoms of hypoxia that may occur during normal aqueous exposure to high organic matter extracts using the microinjection method a total of 12 samples out of the 32 samples examined presented no observable estrogenic effects in fish embryos based on integrated density values in samples where the fish test showed no estrogenic effect the liver of the larvae was significantly damaged due to sample toxicity our results clearly show that the combination of these methods provides a highly effective screening tool for samples containing high concentrations of organic matter graphical abstract ga1 keywords irrigation

introduction xenoestrogens or endocrine disrupting compounds edc are widely present in our environment and exposure to them can have serious consequences for wildlife and humans adeel et al 2017 mills and chichester 2005 sumpter 2005 estrogenic substances have several adverse effects such as disturbing the hormonal system reducing the efficiency of the immune system causing developmental disorders and the most common negative effect is dysfunction of the reproductive system which can lead to reduced fertility and changes in sexual behavior carnevali et al 2018 kavlock and ankley 1996 söffker and tyler 2012 zhou et al 2009 agricultural wastes are a source of natural and synthetic steroid estrogens as well as other estrogenic compounds several studies have demonstrated the presence of farm animal derived steroid hormones in manure and wastewater from dairy farms hanselman et al 2006 2003 kjær et al 2007 lafrance and caron 2013 natural steroidal estrogen hormones are excreted in the urine and feces of all species sexes and classes of farm animals therefore livestock wastes are potential sources of edc in the environment adeel et al 2017 hanselman et al 2006 2003 agricultural manure waste is useful for agricultural landowners who use it as nutrient for plants manure is usually spread on soil surfaces or more recently injected to meet the nutrient requirements of plants as well as positively influence soil structure humus content water air and heat management amin et al 2014 das et al 2017 however the estrogen load associated with these substances and agricultural areas may pose a risk to plants terrestrial organisms aquatic organisms and to humans through the food chain within the manure including liquid manure slurry there are many types of estrogens and conjugated estrogens in dairy cattle e1 17alpha e2 and 17beta e2 secretions have been detected in faeces and urine in their parent compound forms as well as in their conjugated e1 sulphate and e2 alpha glucuronide forms hanselman et al 2006 2003 johnson et al 2006 the chemical diversity of these estrogenic substances makes the testing of their presence difficult as different analytical methods are required for their detection sumpter 2005 this is further complicated by the fact that these substances are mostly in the form of complex mixtures in the environment adeel et al 2017 sumpter 2005 effect based screening methods offer a solution to this problem such as the use of biomonitor bioindicator organisms fetter et al 2014 gorelick and halpern 2011 routledge and sumpter 1996 sanseverino et al 2008 due to the diversity of estrogenic substances and the complexity of the endocrine system there are a lot of potential mechanisms of action e g genomic and non genomic pathways and autocrine paracrine signaling networks that may be susceptible to the adverse effects of endocrine disruptors kiyama and wada kiyama 2015 mueller 2004 zacharewski 1998 because of these complexities the use of a multilevel approach for complementary in vivo and in vitro assays is essential to test the estrogenic activity of a substance or a complex sample beresford et al 2000 jarque et al 2016 zacharewski 1998 their combination and use is even recommended by oecd and the epa as well huet 2000 fenner crisp et al 2000 additionally the european water framework directive wfd aims to identify potential effect based tools e g biomarkers and bioassays and implement them for the monitoring and assessment of the quality of surface water bodies könemann et al 2018 wernersson et al 2015 genetically modified saccharomyces cerevisiae strains are in vitro tools that are routinely used for environmental monitoring including measuring estrogenic effects and they play an important role in the identification and first screening of estrogenic compounds that interact with estrogen receptors routledge and sumpter 1996 sanseverino et al 2008 these yeast based in vitro eukaryotic systems are cost effective tools that allow for the rapid screening of a large number of compounds or mixtures in solvents payne et al 2000 viganò et al 2008 native aqueous samples hettwer et al 2018 and concentrated environmental samples e g solid phase extracts spe bistan et al 2012 zhao et al 2009 the yes screen has many advantages over other systems including the absence of endogenous steroid hormone receptors and a consequent lack of complex interactions between the estrogen receptor er and other receptors however their limitations such as being unable to model complex physiological processes in an organism e g biotransformation pharmacokinetics or to detect hormone sensitive phases of different life stages may result in unreliable predictions kunz et al 2006 zacharewski 1998 among vertebrates the role of fish in environmental risk assessment is significant as aquatic organisms are particularly affected by edc contamination mills and chichester 2005 sumpter 2005 their endocrine system and physiological processes show strong similarities with other vertebrates including mammals hill et al 2005 therefore they are widely used to test for estrogenic substances and model their potential physiological effect bakos et al 2019 mills and chichester 2005 sumpter 2005 recently several estrogen sensitive biosensor lines have been created using laboratory fish models such as zebrafish danio rerio abdelmoneim et al 2019 bakos et al 2019 chen et al 2010 gorelick and halpern 2011 tong et al 2009 the main advantage of zebrafish as a biosensor line is the transparent body of the embryos and larvae in our lab we have created a novel transgenic fluorescent vitellogenin zebrafish model tg vtg1 mcherry which allows for the fluorescent mcherry reporter signal to be easily studied in vivo upon exposure to estrognic substances without sacrificing the animal bakos et al 2019 tsang 2010 the testing of organic matter rich substances in fish especially in embryos can cause problems due to hypoxia in the test vessel which can lead to secondary effects that may interfere with the evaluation of the results küster and altenburger 2008 strecker et al 2011 microinjection is a simple way to introduce polar nonpolar or organic matter rich test substances into newly fertilized fish eggs or developing fish embryos colman et al 2004 mizell and romig 1997 schubert et al 2014 walker et al 1992 the results of microinjection are complex and it is not always possible to directly compare the results with classical acute and long term tests where embryos are exposed via waterborne exposure however microinjection is a good supplement option to conventional tests in certain cases such as the examination of complex samples with a high organic matter concentration schubert et al 2014 csenki et al 2019 the microinjection technique also allows for the delivery of very precise amounts of a material csenki et al 2019 shortly after microinjection the effects on embryonic development are visible and even minor toxic effects can be distinguished from background mortality and other sublethal symptoms schubert et al 2014 the distribution of the substance in the yolk is not always uniform so it can only be sure about the absorption of the total introduced substance if the total amount of the yolk disappears from the body of the embryos this happens at 165 12 hpf hours post fertilization in case of zebrafish litvak and jardine 2003 in the case of high organic matter containing samples the method can help to eliminate the secondary effects caused by hypoxia by placing the test substance directly into the body of the embryos and not into the fluid in the test vessel where decomposition processes can possibly begin which can reduce oxygen levels csenki et al 2019 before experiments depending on the test endpoints and test material several parameters of the method need to be optimized which is a relative disadvantage compared to the commonly used aquatic exposure and standardized test protocols csenki et al 2019 schubert et al 2014 these study use a vitellogenin reporter transgenic zebrafish line tg vtg1 mcherry whose properties must also be taken into account when designing the experiments the zebrafish liver where vitellogenin is also produced starts to develop 6 h after fertilization 6 hpf and begins to function after 50 h 50 hpf ober et al 2003 tao and peng 2009 due to the effect of estrogenic substances the liver is able to produce endogenous vitellogenin from the age of 2 3 days of an embryo chen et al 2010 similar and parallel synchronous to the endogenous vitellogenin the mcherry reporter is only expressed in the liver as well where the first stronger fluorescent signals are detected in the embryos at 72 h of age and then the signal strength and the size of the fluorescent area increase as the liver develops thus facilitating the evaluation of studies bakos et al 2019 in addition to the size and maturity of the liver the structural integrity of the liver also affects the intensity of fluorescent sign and the size of the area the cells of the embryos including their liver cells can be damaged by higher concentrations of toxic substances bakos et al 2013 2019 in that case the induction of vitellogenin production could be strongly decreased so this had to be taken into account in the design of the experiments besides embryos also have significant individual sensitivities which must be taken into consideration too when setting experimental numbers csenki et al 2020 waste from livestock farms has complex matrices and poses a significant challenge to achieve accurate measurement of estrogens and their effects however in vivo and in vitro effect directing methods are suitable to analyze the estrogenic potential of these complex samples noguera oviedo and aga 2016 in order to demonstrate the usefulness of a combined in vivo and in vitro study on agricultural waste our research was conducted at four dairy cattle farms which used a slurry management system we focused on determining the presence of estrogenic chemicals in the slurry using two models of estrogen detection the in vitro yes test yes yeast estrogen screen which provides a predictive value when possible human health effects need to be measured was used to monitor the quantitative changes of estrogenic substances in slurry the in vivo test utilized our estrogen sensitive tg vtg1 mcherry transgenic zebrafish embryos combined with a microinjection based method in order to avoid the inherent difficulties in testing organic matter rich samples this method enables a more complete assessment of estrogenicity and toxicity to vertebrate animals our aim was to develop a method that allows the transgenic fish model when used in combination with the yes test to detect estrogenicity in organic matter rich samples more accurately 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample origin site 1 k location komárom esztergom

stables with deep litter recreation pits are regularly cleaned by rinsing and the wastewater is drained into a slurry storage tank this farm uses a separator in order to separate the liquid and solid parts of slurry the solid part is treated as manure the liquid part is stored in a pool continuously mixed with two high performance stirrers and then transferred to the fields on a regular basis site 2 v location pest county hungary the average number of animals at the site consists of 1800 cows including 1200 milking cows and 1500 calves the farm has deep littered stables the pre feeding area of the stables is cleaned three times a day the cleaned waste is drained into a storage tank where it is stirred together with the wastewater of the milking house washing system since there is no separator and the dry matter content of slurry is significant there are 4 high performance stirrers operating continuously in order to prevent sedimentation site 3 s location baranya county hungary the average number of animals at the site consists of 900 cows including 700 milking cows and 800 calves the farm has 50 deep littered stables and 50 barns with rest boxes recreation pits are regularly cleaned by rinsing and the wastewater drained into a slurry storage tank they use a separator machine for the separation of the liquid and solid parts of the slurry the solid part is treated as manure the liquid part is stored in a pool and continuously mixed with two high performance stirrers it is important to note that during the sampling the separator was out of order several times which means the samples contained increased dry matter content site 4 sz location somogy county hungary the average number of animals at the site consists of 2100 cows including 1400 milking cows and 1700 calves the farm has barns with rest boxes where automated manure cleaning equipment periodically clean the stables from the pits situated next to the barns automated pumps transmit the slurry to the slurry storage tank where the slurry is mixed with the wastewater of the milking house washing system the liquid and solid part is transferred and dispensed together to the fields anti inflammatory drugs antibiotics sex inducing and synchronising products are used regularly additionally parlour acid and or alkaline based chemicals for the disinfection of milking cows and trotter care products are applied at each farm on a monthly basis 2 2 yeast estrogen screen for the investigation of estrogenic effect four samples were taken from the fresh slurry storage pools where the slurry was usually stored for 30 days samples were taken each time from each edge of the pools 1 l each and then combined in all pools the slurry was mechanically mixed thus the samples were considered homogenous and representative they were collected in disposable sterile polypropylene 50 ml falcon tubes which were free of dnase rnase endotoxins and metals during the sampling we were careful to avoid using other plastic accessories samples were placed in the refrigerator at 4 c and processed within 4 6 days after sampling the samples were centrifuged in 50 ml falcon tubes for 20 min at a speed of 3900 rcf held at a constant temperature of 4 c samples including endocrine disrupting shemicals were extracted from the 30 ml supernatant using solid phase micro extraction spe first the extraction cartridge strata x 200 mg 6 ml from phenomenex usa was conditioned using a mixture of 8 ml methanol and 8 ml water at a 95 5 ratio completing a regular rinse with technical grade methanol solution in the second step 30 ml of liquid slurry supernatant was passed through the cartridge in the third step rinsing was performed with a mixture of 10 ml methanol water 1 1 and 10 ml acetone water 2 1 after a few minutes of drying the retained components were eluted in 5 ml methanol after elution 200 μl of sample was dissolved in 1800 μl methanol which was a 10 fold dilution then further 1 50 1 100 1 500 1 1000 1 5000 and 1 10 000 dilutions were prepared for yes testing two 2 grams of the sediment from centrifugation was mixed with 10 ml methanol and sonicated for 30 min at 30

the sample extracts was evaluated using the recombinant yeast strain yes according to the protocol iso 1904 0 1 2018 iso 19040 the yes is a reporter gene assay which can be used for the measurement of the activation of the human estrogen receptor alpha herα in the presence of a sample containing compounds which cause estrogenic effects the test strain is derived from saccharomyces cerevisiae bj3505 protease deficient matα pep4 his3 prb 1 delta1 6 r his3 delta200 lys2 801 trp1 delta101 ura3 52gal2can1 this strain harbours two plasmids the plasmid yepe10 contains the cup1 her fusion which encodes the human estrogen receptor α cloned from the mcf 7 human cell lineage under the control of the metallothionein promoter cup1 this plasmid is selected via the tryptophane auxothropy of the parent strain the second plasmid is the reporter plasmid yrpeg3 which contains the fusion gene 2ere cyc1 lacz this fusion gene express the β galactosidase encoded by lacz under the control of the iso1cytochrom c promoter from s cerevisiae which is fused to two copies of the vitellogenina2 gene from xenopus laevis this plasmid is selected via the uracil auxothropy of the parent strain iso 19040 mcdonnell et al 1991 the yes test continuously produces the human estrogen receptor the estrogen receptor belongs to the family of nuclear hormone receptors when the yeast encounters estrogen or a homologous molecule it produces a β galactosidase enzyme β galactosidase catalyzes the hydrolysis of the galactoside analog chlorophenol red β d galactopyranoside cprg and converts the yellow orange cprg substrate into the red chromophore chlorophenol red yielding a dark red solution this was measured using a microplate reader at 580 nm to determine the amount of substrate converted the amount of estrogenic substances in the specified sample were given in relative estrogen activity or 17β estradiol e2 equivalents eeq ng l mcdonnell et al 1991 routledge and sumpter 1996 iso 19040 for the

using a 4 or 5 parameter logistic regression model findlay and dillard 2007 for the determination of eeq the corrected absorbance of the sample extracts was interpolated in the linear range of the corresponding estradiol standard curve hong 2012 the resulting eeq concentration indicates that the estrogen activity of the sample is equivalent to the estrogen activity of an equal concentration of

cut off is of high importance to discriminate between responded and non responded individuals several standard methods have been proposed to choose optimal cut offs and all require known positive and

15 of the expected value during the study 2 samples from each site were tested four times with the liquid and solid phases remaining separate samples were collected from 4 dairy cattle farms with different characteristics in general all samples showed estrogenic activity based on the yes test the detailed results of the yeast estrogen screen are shown in fig 1 at k farm 5 15502 ng l eeq values were measured in the liquid phase and 70 2809 ng l in the solid phase the extremely broad range was due to the slurry separator used since elimination of solid parts reduces the edcs as a result of a purification process in the period from march to july there were outstanding values when the separator was out of order and unseparated slurry samples were tested in the case of v farm 462 7896 ng l estrogen activity was measured in the liquid and 252 6339 ng l in the solid phases while in the case of sz farm 864 3338 ng l eeq was measured in the liquid phase and 380 3242 ng l in the solid phase based on the results s farm had the highest estrogen activities 2583 50 518 ng l in the liquid phase and 858 3746 ng l in the solid phase transgenic yeast based assays including the yes test are excellent for the rapid and reliable testing of estrogenic activity in manure based containing samples however instead of direct testing of native samples testing of different extracts is recommended in this case the high organic matter content of native manure samples reduces the sensitivity of the yes test and may be cytotoxic to yeast which may also have a negative effect on test results holbrook et al 2005 parent compounds e1 17alpha e2 and 17beta e2 mean the main estrogenic substances in the manure which can be detected by the yes test the results obtained can be given as estrogen equivalent gadd et al 2010b schoenborn et al 2015 significant amounts of these compounds are excreted daily by farms 300 11400 µg d 1 fecal and 500 160000 µg d 1 urinary excretion per 1000 kg live animal mass the amount of estrogenic substances measured in manure shows high variability based in the literature on field studies reporting the concentration of estrogens up to 16500 ng l hanselman et al 2003 raman et al 2004 the actual estrogen release of a livestock farm can be affected by several factors e g the number of pregnant animals and the stage of pregnancy age mass diet season health status circadian variation hanselman et al 2006 johnson et al 2006 schoenborn et al 2015 therefore as our results show estrogen emissions within a site are not constant or may vary from site to site in commercial animal production systems faeces and urine are not collected and treated separately in most cases however they are often used in livestock farm s manure storage and treatment systems to control pathogens odor and nutrient loading to the environment alegbeleye and sant ana 2020 noguera oviedo and aga 2016 schoenborn et al 2015 these treatments e g solid liquid separation long term storage use of lagune systems aeration etc have varying degrees of ability to reduce the estrogenic effect of the manure gadd et al 2010a hutchins et al 2007 noguera oviedo and aga 2016 zheng et al 2008 on the sites examined in the study the selected treatment procedures did not eliminate the estrogen content of the manure however the separator was able to significantly reduce it the amounts of estrogenic compounds determined as estrogen equivalents in the yes test ranged from 5 ng l to 50 518 ng l for the four dairy farms the levels of estrogen detected in the yes test are substantially higher than the levels known to cause endocrine disruption in aquatic organisms e g sex ratio skewed toward females reversible vtg induction reduced egg production formation of ova testes in males etc adeel et al 2017 brion et al 2004 leet et al 2011 our results show that the level of estrogenicity in the tested manure samples was high enough to have a measurable effect on fish thus we began the next phase of our study using the fish embryo model 3 2 results of microinjection based fish embryo tests since this study consists of a method development and a field analysis part it will be presented separately in this section 3 2 1 method development prior to testing several factors had to be considered when designing the experiments because the primary goal in testing the samples on zebrafish embryos was to detect estrogenic activity an experimental design had to be found where the amount of samples injected would not cause any crucial organ damage in the individuals but contained enough estrogenic substances to induce a fluorescent signal in the liver during acute treatment to determine the droplet size used in the experiments a sample v3 liquid that was found to be highly toxic in the yeast experiment was injected since the amount of material injected has an upper limit at which the embryos are not damaged furthermore we did not have any preliminary results on the toxicity of the samples on zebrafish embryos the samples were further concentrated to achieve the smallest possible injection droplet size during sample concentration the acetone originally used was replaced with dmso because based on literature data more advanced embryos from 3 dpf appeared to tolerate this solvent better maes et al 2012 these sample treatments were performed on all samples tested and were used for further experiments in this study 3 different volumes of v3 sample were injected into the yolk of 3 day old embryos 0 074 nl droplet diameter 50 µm 1 02 nl 125 µm and 4 17 nl 200 µm v3 marked samples were treated with three injected volumes and then mortality was examined for 4 days for the first two days there was no difference in mortality results between treatments however 72 h after injection the mortality data 0 074 and 1 02 nl p 0 05 0 074 and 4 17 nl p 0 01 1 02 and 4 17 nl p 0 01 were significantly different on the fourth day after injection there was essentially no death among the smallest injected individuals in the case of 1 02 nl treatment only half of the embryos 51 67 7 64 survived while at the highest injected dose 28 67 5 51 of the individuals were alive no mortality occurred between control non injected individuals data not shown based on these results the samples were later injected with the smallest tested volume 0 074 nl fig 2a the length of exposure time was determined using the average amount of estrogen equivalent calculated from the original non concentrated samples in the yeast test 3000 ng l e2 which was injected into 3 day old embryos with the lowest amount 0 074 nl as determined in the previous test the number of individuals showing a fluorescent signal was monitored daily for 4 days after treatment it is clear from the results that the number of embryos exhibiting a fluorescent signal was increasing over time post injection fig 2b there were embryos as early as 24 h post treatment in which a fluorescent signal could be observed in the liver 3 33 2 89 a significant increase in the number of fluorescent embryos first occurred 72 h after injection by that time 38 33 5 77 of the embryos produced fluorescent protein expression on the last day of the 96 hour study period the previous day s value doubled to 80 4 10 22 based on these results this time point was chosen as the end of post injection exposures in further experiments 3 2 2 field analysis based on the protocol established in the method development section liquid and sediment phase slurry samples collected from 4 sites at 4 different time points were examined on transgenic zebrafish embryos according to the developed microinjection and evaluation protocol regarding the tested manure samples the number of surviving larvae was sufficient for integrated density studies estrogen positive samples were found for all sites both from the liquid and sediment phases based on the transgenic fish model fig 3 there was a 62 5 correspondence between the yeast and fish test results indicating estrogenic effects of the samples out of the 32 samples examined a total of 12 samples did not show estrogenic effects in the fish embryo studies based on integrated density values from the liquid phase only one of the k and one of the v site samples was found to be non estrogenic samples k1 and v3 however k1 k3 s4 v2 v4 and sz1 sediment phase samples were estrogenic integrated density values showed high variation within each treatment the differences in individual sensitivity mentioned above were much more significant in the case of irrigation water samples compared to individual active ingredients due to the large standard deviations commonly used statistical methods did not seem to be suitable for determining estrogenicity therefore data were first evaluated by the kruskal wallis analysis with dunn s multiple comparisons test data not shown but despite the fact that many of the treated embryos were visually observable and showed clear fluorescence in the liver the test gave negative results in several cases the cut off formula classen et al 1987 lardeux et al 2016 seemed to be much more suitable for evaluating the results since in this case estrogenicity was in agreement with the visually observed fluorescence examining the results further it is apparent that for some samples the integrated density results were of a lower value than the control integrated density results 9 274 0 7403 an explicit decrease was observed only in the case of sediment samples s2 0 02429 0 01991 s3 0 03094 0 02778 sz2 0 06967 0 07831 sz4 0 06502 0 08568 vitellogenin production in embryos was determined by developmental stage and the structural integrity of the liver bakos et al 2019 csenki et al 2020 faisal et al 2020 representative images of the livers of the embryos clearly show that in cases where integrated density values were considerably lower the shape and size of the liver differed from the control suggesting that the liver is sensitive to exposure fig 4 the reduced liver size could be due to liver inflammation degeneration or necrosis which can also be confirmed by the characteristic liver color change he et al 2013 wolf and wheeler 2018 zhang et al 2016 these effects may reduce or prevent the appearance of the fluorescent signal and may indicate hepatotoxic properties of the tested sample despite the fact that the sample may have an estrogenic effect based on the yes test as can be seen from the results in samples where a significant fluorescent signal was observed the liver of the embryos did not show a considerable difference compared to the control so it can be assumed that these samples had low toxicity to the embryos numerous studies in the literature show that estrogen contamination of waterways is a concern due to the presence of these chemicals which among other pathologies can adversely affect the reproductive biology of aquatic wildlife including fish brion et al 2004 hanselman et al 2003 leet et al 2011 mills and chichester 2005 sumpter 2005 the real estrogenic effect of manure released into the environment is influenced affected by several factors e g the relative proportion and amount of estrogenic compounds water solubility half life of chemicals biotransformation and biodegradation of microorganisms interactions with other edc compounds the properties of soil and water bodies environmental and climatic conditions etc adeel et al 2017 biswas et al 2013 khan and lee 2012 ma et al 2016 yang et al 2021 in addition manure also contains a number of other compounds that do not necessarily have hormonal effects however through their toxic effects they may also affect vitellogenin production as can be seen from our results 3 3 combined results in summary the microinjection method developed for tg vtg1 mcherry embryos was shown to be suitable for studying the estrogenic effect of liquid and sediment manure samples extracts prepared for yes tests after solvent exchange were appropriate for injection experiments so extracts were not needed to be prepared separately for the two methods the embryo test gave a definitive yes no answer to the estrogenic effect of the sample however the duration of the test was significantly longer than for the yes test using the two methods in combination provides a highly effective screening approach where the results of the rapid yes test are complementary to the valuable data from the new in vivo test method enabling a more complete assessment of estrogenicity and toxicity however results of long term and acute toxicological tests are not comparable directly with the results of the microinjection method the aim of this work was to develop a screening method that is able to determine if a particular sample may pose estrogenic risk when placed into the environment this method allows for the quick and efficient detection of the estrogenic activity of organic matter rich samples which are difficult or unable to be tested by conventional aquatic tests 4 conclusions waste from livestock farms including manure is one of the most significant sources of estrogenic pollutants in the environment these wastes have complex matrices so complementary in vivo and in vitro tests are needed in order to investigate their true estrogenic effects transgenic models are highly beneficial such that in this study an in vivo and an in vitro transgenic model were used to examine manure samples from four dairy cattle farms with different characteristics the estrogenicity of the samples was determined by the two test methods and the correlation of the two models was explored the first in vitro screenings were performed with a classical yes test using a genetically modified saccharomyces cerevisiae model based on the results of the yes test a new test method was developed for a tg vtg1 mcherry transgenic zebrafish embryo model where exposure was carried out by microinjection which eliminated secondary symptoms of hypoxia that may occur during normal aqueous exposure to high organic matter extracts the yes test results were positive for all samples tested regardless of whether the sample came from the liquid or sediment phase the eeq values detected by the yes test consistent with the literature data indicated orders of magnitude that could already pose a potential environmental risk due to the high sensitivity of the embryos the fish test in contrast to the yes test was able to give primarily only yes no answers when detecting the estrogenic effect the overlap between the results of the two methods was 62 5 in terms of estrogen detection however as a complex organism the zebrafish embryo test was also suitable for the detection of any sublethal organ specific toxicity of samples primarily hepatoxicity complementing the results of the yes test combined the results obtained by the yes and fish tests are more relevant from the environmental perspective as interactions between chemicals are detected and these could have a higher predictive value when possible effects need to be determined several international organizations oecd epa recommend the use of complementary in vivo and in vitro methods for various toxicological ecotoxicological tests using the advantages of biomarker based monitoring and other effect based methods is increasingly becoming the focus of research in these areas the integration of such tools in addition to existing methods is also supported promoted by the eu water framework directive wfd as this can significantly improve its biomonitoring strategy the inclusion of the method combination presented in the study may be an alternative to be used by the wfd for the examination of special samples with high organic matter content the use of these combined methods can help with the risk management of water utilization the economical application of the water to minimize treat monitor and control the probability or impact of unfortunate events and support environmental protection additionally these methods can provide assistance in the development of technologies and methods that reduce the effects of estrogenic compounds to the environment credit authorship contribution statement zsolt csenki conceptualization formal analysis funding acquisition

9326,creation of a dry soil mulch to maintain near surface moisture in dry environments is an ancient practice that is still used in many regions of the world for timely establishment of crops after long fallow before availability of herbicides the first tillage during fallow was timed to kill weeds but now the optimum timing for tillage depends only on the interplay of evaporation and infiltration of rain the goal is to maximize total root zone water storage and seed zone water at seeding time our objective was to measure the effect of delaying soil mulch creation progressively later in the spring and summer on weed free fallow for winter wheat triticum aestivum l in the mediterranean inland pacific northwest drylands of the united states over a period of six years and a total of 12 site years four to seven tillage timings were compared to an untilled treatment soil water was measured at seeding time in the seed zone and total root zone seed zone water and total stored water produced by different tillage timings was surprisingly constant with few statistically significant or substantial differences on average only 2 of stored water was lost in the top 1 0 m of soil over 80 days during the hot dry period towards the end of fallow responses to late spring rain could be seen and tillage near the end of june early summer often produced maximum soil water content keywords dryland wheat evaporation water infiltration soil mulch notill seed zone data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction mediterranean climates have hot dry summers and cool wet winters in deep silt loam soils of the pacific northwest this creates a good environment for winter wheat sown in late summer or early fall into stored soil water after a 13 month fallow this allows the winter wheat seedlings to become established before the onset of cold weather to maximize depth of rooting in many low precipitation locations a long fallow period is required for economically viable crop production aiken et al 2013 in much of central and eastern washington late summer and early fall rain is not reliable enough for establishing the crop in time for deep root development before spring to ensure vigorous plant stand establishment before winter many growers use tillage during fallow to create a soil mulch the discontinuity between the tilled surface soil and consolidated subsoil produces an accumulation of soil water in the soil below the depth of tillage specialized deep furrow drills are used to place wheat seed under the mulch into moist soil this method has been a reliable and productive farming method for dryland wheat growers since the mid 1960 s schillinger and papendick 2008 schillinger and young 2014 negative aspects of the system are the amount of tillage required and the resultant exposure to soil erosion modern seed drills are being designed to sow into greater amounts of surface residue which creates the opportunity to design systems with a minimum of tillage and good erosion resistance that also produce optimum grain yields certain climates and soils and the widespread and increasing issue of herbicide resistance lyon et al 2021 makes minimum tillage systems attractive in many locations long fallow periods with early seeding of wheat is currently being explored as an adaptation to a warming climate in parts of australia kirkegaard and hunt 2010 cann et al 2020 hunt et al 2021 thus despite the successes of intensified systems for replacing long fallow with continuous cropping long fallow remains an important system worthy of research and efforts toward improvement the tilled fallow system was developed at a time when herbicide use was uncommon and tillage was used to eliminate weeds as well as establish a soil mulch the elimination of weed and volunteer wheat growth is vital to maximizing soil water storage even in climates with summer rainfall such as the us great plains region greb and zimdahl 1980 a soil mulch is a layer of tilled soil intended to reduce evaporation hammel et al 1981 the mulch disrupts water film continuity and capillary flow of water this reduces both infiltration of rain downward and capillary flow upward to the evaporation zone if the additional air filled voids created by the tillage do not create large passages for convection of air deep into the mulch the loss of vapor is not increased and a mulch of 10 cm or more allows a relatively high soil water content to exist directly below the mulch wuest 2010 silt loam soils with sufficient water deeper in the profile can maintain seed zone water without further rainfall through july august and part of september for quick germination and establishment of winter wheat if the cultivar has sufficient coleoptile and first leaf length to emerge through 10 15 cm of dry soil mulch a fine soil mulch can suspend any summer or fall rain in a surface crust with a layer of dry loose mulch below leading to complete loss to evaporation hunt et al 2013 untilled soil on the other hand wicks water from rain downward quickly reducing evaporative loss especially if the surface is covered with residue the practice of leaving the soil untilled throughout the entire 13 month fallow period is an option being increasingly used by growers in the pacific northwest drylands if no till is maintained for many years accumulated surface organic matter resists aggregate slaking soil sealing and crusting this aids in water infiltration on the other hand the more rapid movement of water in untilled soil causes a more gradual soil water gradient through the seed zone because of a lack of a discontinuity created by a tilled soil mulch wuest and schillinger 2011 in general untilled soil has less likelihood of maintaining adequate seed zone soil water throughout the hot dry summer compared to tilled fallow hammel et al 1981 it is essential to have seed zone water within the surface 15 cm to place germinate and emerge winter wheat seedlings in the optimum time window of late summer early fall weed control is essential for preserving soil water during fallow the fewer and smaller the weeds the less soil water is lost hunt et al 2013 lutcher 2015 with the availability of herbicides to control weeds growers have become comfortable delaying tillage until later in the spring schillinger 2001 showed that delaying tillage until mid may or later did not result in yield loss in a 6 year study there remains concern that delaying tillage even further into the warmer drier late spring and summer will result in poor seed zone water or an overall decrease in stored soil water to our knowledge there has been no previously published study comparing a series of successive mulch creation tillage operations from spring on into summer for soils under hot dry summer conditions we tested two hypotheses to help define the maximum flexibility growers have in timing the establishment of a soil mulch the first hypothesis was that progressively later tillage would reduce seed zone water content substantially as the chance of rain decreases and temperatures increase our second hypothesis was that tillage would halt the infiltration of post tillage rainfall events so that late spring events would not be stored in tilled plots but could be stored in plots not yet tilled 2 materials and methods the research was conducted at three locations representing low precipitation wheat producing areas in the pacific northwest the sites were separated by 120 225 km and each has a 20 year average rainfall of only 19 23 mm total during the combined months of july august and september summer the koppen climate classification is csb warm summer mediterranean climate https www plantmaps com koppen climate classification map united states php within locations the plot area was moved each year and followed a winter wheat crop in the normal 2 year winter wheat fallow rotation the winter wheat fallow rotation begins with winter wheat being planted late august or september late summer harvested the following july mid summer with fallow from harvest through winter spring and summer of the next year the lind location was at the washington state university dryland research station near lind wa 47 00 n 118 34 w 500 m elevation precipitation was recorded at an official us national weather service recording site located 0 5 km from the experiment long term 100 year average annual precipitation at the site is 244 mm the soil at the site is a shano silt loam coarse silty mixed superactive mesic

mean annual precipitation most of it from september to june soil at the site is a walla walla silt loam coarse silty mixed superactive mesic typic haploxeroll with 15 clay 58 silt and 27 sand soil survey staff 2022 with 0 7 1 2 organic carbon measured by combustion mean daily air temperature is 0 5 c during january and 20 c during july and august in 2012 2013 and 2014 two 81 cm wide undercutter sweeps haybuster duratech industries international jamestown nd were mounted on the three point hitch of a small tractor the sweep blades were set to operate 10 cm below the soil surface creating a soil mulch of about 13 cm this produced individual plot widths of 1 6 m and the plots were 30 m long the tillage timing treatments were randomized in side by side plots in each of four replicate blocks soil cloddiness varied somewhat depending on surface soil moisture but the goal was that the untilled soil below the sweep depth would be completely covered by a mix of fine soil and clods depending on the year and location as many as seven tillage timings from march through july spring through mid summer were performed each on a new untilled plot an additional plot in each block was never tilled and this served as a comparison representing no till fallow weeds were controlled with herbicides or by hand the experiment was continued at the lind site for another three years in 2017 2018 and 2019 using a commercial size undercutter sweep implement in 7 30 m individual plots and with a phoenix rolling harrow attached behind the sweeps the purpose of the attached rolling harrow was to break up larger soil clods and help fill air voids in the tillage much in this last 3 year period there were only four tillage timing treatments spaced about 21 days apart tillage was delayed if recent rain had produced excessively moist surface soil also in these final three years at lind the plot area was planted to winter wheat using standard deep furrow practices schillinger 2001 in late august after 13 months of fallow and harvested the following july with a plot combine to compare grain yield among treatments the single pass of the undercutter sweep buries some of the surface residue compared to the untilled state typically about one third of the surface residue left at harvest is still on the soil surface after minimum tillage in the following spring schillinger 2001 incremental soil samples to 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 20 25 30 35 40 and 45 cm soil depths were taken at seeding time using a 5 cm diameter coring tube starting in 2013 soil coring in 20 cm increments below 45 cm was extended to 180 cm or as deep as the hydraulic probe would penetrate which was sometimes limited by caliche or very dry soil soil water was determined by loss in a drying oven at 105 c comparing soil water between a tilled soil and an untilled soil presents a problem caused by the difference in soil bulk density that occurs immediately upon tillage the soil surface is raised and samples measured from that raised surface contain less soil than they would from the un tilled surface it is also difficult to accurately locate an uneven soil surface for those reasons equivalent mass depths were used to calculate the depth of each soil sample based on the cumulative dry mass of each soil core increment wuest 2009 soil water content was interpolated between successive depths to compute water storage representing the exact same soil mass per unit area the customary linear depth from the soil surface is provided for reference based on the overall average mass to cm depth relationship of untilled soil 2 1 graphing this experiment has treatments that are on a continuous date scale as the tillage dates varied from year to year and sometimes location to location for this reason the treatment means are joined by lines which show how the resulting soil water at seeding time varied with timing of tillage individual measurements from each replicate are plotted to show the scatter around the mean 2 2 statistical analysis our working hypothesis was there would be a particular timing of soil mulch creation each year which would maximize seed zone water and a timing of soil mulch creation that would maximize total water storage at time of winter wheat seeding in late summer september the tillage timings each year were spaced several weeks apart but we also considered soil conditions since it was considered unrealistic to till while the soil surface was still damp from a recent rain and redistribution downward was likely ongoing given experience from the first three years the last three year s tillage timings were limited to four timings approximately 21 days apart for analysis we chose timings from the first three years that most closely matched the last three years herein called uniform at echo in 2014 the fourth uniform timing is missing the effect of tillage date on gravimetric water at specific depths in the seed zone and cumulative soil water from the surface to four depths at seeding time was explored using a linear mixed model with year and location as random effects to look for significant trends that might predict best tillage timing practices water storage to four depths for all 12 site years and all tillage timings were examined using linear regression with location and year as random effects only tillage timings before

depths near the surface just before winter wheat seeding early september about day of year 250 is shown in fig 1 we report data as gravimetric soil water because this relates to water potential seed germination and seedling emergence response regardless of soil bulk density rainfall between tillage treatments often increased soil water at time of winter wheat seeding in treatments not yet tilled when the rainfall occurred for example in 2014 at moro the second and third tillage dates had greater soil moisture at seeding time than the first tillage date this increase in soil water caused by rain on untilled soil was maintained all the way to day 253 when the soil was sampled the third tillage timing ended up retaining the most water at the surface of all tillage timings at that location and year averages of the four uniform timings marked with triangles fig 1 over all 12 site years were not significantly different at 15 and 21 cm at the 26 cm depth the no till treatment had

between day 100 and 150 april 10 and may 30 tillage near day 150 often produced the greatest gravimetric water content at seeding time echo and lind in 2014 produced the only instances where the earliest tillage timing produced the highest gravimetric water at seeding time in the surface layers these were instances of substantially less soil water in the deeper soil profile fig 2 in general plots that had been tilled did not appear to respond to later rain as well as plots not yet tilled and sometimes plots tilled after significant rain did not respond as much as plots tilled a treatment or two later fig 1 during long periods where little or no rain occurred treatments not yet tilled consistently lost surface water compared to tilled treatments another observation is the high surface water content at all seed zone depths at the echo site in 2013 this can be explained by the rain before sampling in combination with high levels of soil water in the deeper profile fig 2 3 2 deep soil

p 0 02 4 discussion 4 1 the experimental conditions the results of this experiment will apply best to mediterranean locations with wet winters and dry summers silt loam soils with low clay content but good water holding capacity and moderate to weak soil clod aggregation the first three years of this study used one tillage pass with a low disturbance undercutter sweep in the last three years a phoenix rotary harrow was attached behind the sweep to reduce larger clods and ensure a better distribution of fines and more uniform thickness of soil mulch some of the variation from one tillage timing to another at a particular site and year may be due to the size and quantity of clods produced at a given soil water content an instance that stands out is the tillage treatment on day 163 june 12 uniform treatment 3 at lind in 2014 this treatment was noted to have large clods and insufficient fines to protect the subsurface and the result can be seen as a decrease in seed zone water in fig 1 much of the pacific northwest dryland wheat region has fine silt loam soils which provide good water holding capacity low clay content makes for slow hydraulic conductivity and easy mulch creation these characteristics also make the soil prone to wind erosion so minimizing tillage and retaining residue on the soil surface are important to the sustainability of farms throughout the region low precipitation makes it difficult to accumulate large amounts of surface residue especially when back to back drought years occur however research has shown that during summer dry periods of two months or more even 4 7 times the normal residue load has little effect on soil water at seeding time wuest and schillinger 2011 on the positive side a lack of summer rain often reduces or eliminates late summer weed emergence allowing a late tillage operation to provide effective weed control until seeding time 4 2 tillage timing stored soil water in late summer was remarkably similar among the wide range of tillage timings fig 2 this agrees with previous small plot data wuest 2010 the tillage timings producing the most soil water at seeding time were often not the earliest even small amounts of rainfall could improve water content at 21 cm and deeper if it rained before tillage fig 1 since we only measured soil water at time of winter wheat seeding we cannot say that rainfall caused no response to plots if it fell after a tillage operation however our own experiences and that of regional growers indicate that most rain does not penetrate through the dry tillage mulch and soon evaporates schillinger and wuest unpublished data our one point in time sample each year measures the result of infiltration and evaporation over the entire 13 month fallow period however the data do indicate a greater response to rainfall when the rain occurred before tillage rather than after and sometimes maximum response appeared to be two tillage timings later this could be due to continued infiltration of water to below the upcoming tillage depth with more time and additional rainfall the loosened soil in the mulch dries out completely very quickly after tillage leaving a distinct boundary between the loose dry surface mulch and the moist consolidated soil below water must move upward to keep this moist soil from drying late in the summer around mid august the water at the top of the consolidated soil typically starts to dry out in years when the soil profile is not sufficiently recharged during the previous winter there is often not enough deep water to maintain sufficient seed zone water for winter wheat seedlings to emerge growers are then forced to wait until fall rains to establish the crop lindstrom et al 1974 which considerably reduces winter wheat grain yield potential higginbotham et al 2013 june is a month that usually has significant rainfall waiting for this and the weed germination that the rain evokes prior to tillage might be an effective practice as supported by simulation models singh et al 2011 the differences in seed zone water content with different tillage timings may seem minor 21 cm depth at lind in 2012 2013 2018 and 2019 for example but minimum soil water contents above 9 2 gravimetric are needed for reliable winter wheat seedling emergence from deep seeding depths lindstrom et al 1976 donaldson 1996 the supply of water from several cm below the seed is also important to maintaining the seed zone water content for many days from winter wheat seeding until roots are established 4 3 no till compared to tillage fallow the total water storage to 126 cm 1500 kg m 2 was only 0 4 mm lower in no till compared to the average of the four uniform timings of tilled fallow ns deep water storage is of key importance for long

content at 21 26 and 31 cm depths at seeding time other reports of loss of near surface water under no till in semi arid environments are nielsen and vigil 2010 and schillinger and wuest 2021 the discussion above outlines a problem in the pacific northwest where the first fall rains rarely occur soon enough for winter wheat to become established and develop an adequate root system before the onset of winter in contrast at some pacific northwest locations such as northcentral oregon where air temperatures are warmer in the fall and in late winter early spring winter wheat on no till fallow at later seeding dates can outperform winter wheat sown earlier into tilled fallow machado et al 2015 for example in a 10 year study at the echo site equal or greater grain yields were produced under no till fallow compared to a minimum tillage sweep fallow williams and wuest 2021 this site has milder winters and the later and more shallow seeded no till produced better stands and was able to continue root growth into the winter better water infiltration into no till after seeding and during plant development is a possible reason for better yields especially in dry years at the more northern and higher elevation lind location consistent winter wheat grain yield decreases of 30 have been repeatedly documented with late seeding higginbotham et al 2013 schillinger and papendick 2008 4 4 implications for summer fallow practices our results have important implications for maximizing water storage and seed zone water where winter wheat needs to be planted deep to emerge at the end of a long dry fallow period for optimum grain yield potential tillage can be delayed without losing substantial soil water if even small rain events occur prior to tillage and delaying tillage improves storage efficiency of late spring and early summer rainfall an additional advantage to delayed tillage is improved weed control under hotter drier conditions once the soil has been tilled the dust created by ground sprayer applications reduces the effectiveness of herbicides so further tillage is the preferred method of controlling weed flushes that come later delaying tillage until the advent of dry summer months reduces the number of tillage passes required for weed control following the initial primary tillage often only one tillage pass is needed which preserves surface residue and soil aggregation this is important for reduced soil crusting and erosion and improved water infiltration funding this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the

9326,creation of a dry soil mulch to maintain near surface moisture in dry environments is an ancient practice that is still used in many regions of the world for timely establishment of crops after long fallow before availability of herbicides the first tillage during fallow was timed to kill weeds but now the optimum timing for tillage depends only on the interplay of evaporation and infiltration of rain the goal is to maximize total root zone water storage and seed zone water at seeding time our objective was to measure the effect of delaying soil mulch creation progressively later in the spring and summer on weed free fallow for winter wheat triticum aestivum l in the mediterranean inland pacific northwest drylands of the united states over a period of six years and a total of 12 site years four to seven tillage timings were compared to an untilled treatment soil water was measured at seeding time in the seed zone and total root zone seed zone water and total stored water produced by different tillage timings was surprisingly constant with few statistically significant or substantial differences on average only 2 of stored water was lost in the top 1 0 m of soil over 80 days during the hot dry period towards the end of fallow responses to late spring rain could be seen and tillage near the end of june early summer often produced maximum soil water content keywords dryland wheat evaporation water infiltration soil mulch notill seed zone data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction mediterranean climates have hot dry summers and cool wet winters in deep silt loam soils of the pacific northwest this creates a good environment for winter wheat sown in late summer or early fall into stored soil water after a 13 month fallow this allows the winter wheat seedlings to become established before the onset of cold weather to maximize depth of rooting in many low precipitation locations a long fallow period is required for economically viable crop production aiken et al 2013 in much of central and eastern washington late summer and early fall rain is not reliable enough for establishing the crop in time for deep root development before spring to ensure vigorous plant stand establishment before winter many growers use tillage during fallow to create a soil mulch the discontinuity between the tilled surface soil and consolidated subsoil produces an accumulation of soil water in the soil below the depth of tillage specialized deep furrow drills are used to place wheat seed under the mulch into moist soil this method has been a reliable and productive farming method for dryland wheat growers since the mid 1960 s schillinger and papendick 2008 schillinger and young 2014 negative aspects of the system are the amount of tillage required and the resultant exposure to soil erosion modern seed drills are being designed to sow into greater amounts of surface residue which creates the opportunity to design systems with a minimum of tillage and good erosion resistance that also produce optimum grain yields certain climates and soils and the widespread and increasing issue of herbicide resistance lyon et al 2021 makes minimum tillage systems attractive in many locations long fallow periods with early seeding of wheat is currently being explored as an adaptation to a warming climate in parts of australia kirkegaard and hunt 2010 cann et al 2020 hunt et al 2021 thus despite the successes of intensified systems for replacing long fallow with continuous cropping long fallow remains an important system worthy of research and efforts toward improvement the tilled fallow system was developed at a time when herbicide use was uncommon and tillage was used to eliminate weeds as well as establish a soil mulch the elimination of weed and volunteer wheat growth is vital to maximizing soil water storage even in climates with summer rainfall such as the us great plains region greb and zimdahl 1980 a soil mulch is a layer of tilled soil intended to reduce evaporation hammel et al 1981 the mulch disrupts water film continuity and capillary flow of water this reduces both infiltration of rain downward and capillary flow upward to the evaporation zone if the additional air filled voids created by the tillage do not create large passages for convection of air deep into the mulch the loss of vapor is not increased and a mulch of 10 cm or more allows a relatively high soil water content to exist directly below the mulch wuest 2010 silt loam soils with sufficient water deeper in the profile can maintain seed zone water without further rainfall through july august and part of september for quick germination and establishment of winter wheat if the cultivar has sufficient coleoptile and first leaf length to emerge through 10 15 cm of dry soil mulch a fine soil mulch can suspend any summer or fall rain in a surface crust with a layer of dry loose mulch below leading to complete loss to evaporation hunt et al 2013 untilled soil on the other hand wicks water from rain downward quickly reducing evaporative loss especially if the surface is covered with residue the practice of leaving the soil untilled throughout the entire 13 month fallow period is an option being increasingly used by growers in the pacific northwest drylands if no till is maintained for many years accumulated surface organic matter resists aggregate slaking soil sealing and crusting this aids in water infiltration on the other hand the more rapid movement of water in untilled soil causes a more gradual soil water gradient through the seed zone because of a lack of a discontinuity created by a tilled soil mulch wuest and schillinger 2011 in general untilled soil has less likelihood of maintaining adequate seed zone soil water throughout the hot dry summer compared to tilled fallow hammel et al 1981 it is essential to have seed zone water within the surface 15 cm to place germinate and emerge winter wheat seedlings in the optimum time window of late summer early fall weed control is essential for preserving soil water during fallow the fewer and smaller the weeds the less soil water is lost hunt et al 2013 lutcher 2015 with the availability of herbicides to control weeds growers have become comfortable delaying tillage until later in the spring schillinger 2001 showed that delaying tillage until mid may or later did not result in yield loss in a 6 year study there remains concern that delaying tillage even further into the warmer drier late spring and summer will result in poor seed zone water or an overall decrease in stored soil water to our knowledge there has been no previously published study comparing a series of successive mulch creation tillage operations from spring on into summer for soils under hot dry summer conditions we tested two hypotheses to help define the maximum flexibility growers have in timing the establishment of a soil mulch the first hypothesis was that progressively later tillage would reduce seed zone water content substantially as the chance of rain decreases and temperatures increase our second hypothesis was that tillage would halt the infiltration of post tillage rainfall events so that late spring events would not be stored in tilled plots but could be stored in plots not yet tilled 2 materials and methods the research was conducted at three locations representing low precipitation wheat producing areas in the pacific northwest the sites were separated by 120 225 km and each has a 20 year average rainfall of only 19 23 mm total during the combined months of july august and september summer the koppen climate classification is csb warm summer mediterranean climate https www plantmaps com koppen climate classification map united states php within locations the plot area was moved each year and followed a winter wheat crop in the normal 2 year winter wheat fallow rotation the winter wheat fallow rotation begins with winter wheat being planted late august or september late summer harvested the following july mid summer with fallow from harvest through winter spring and summer of the next year the lind location was at the washington state university dryland research station near lind wa 47 00 n 118 34 w 500 m elevation precipitation was recorded at an official us national weather service recording site located 0 5 km from the experiment long term 100 year average annual precipitation at the site is 244 mm the soil at the site is a shano silt loam coarse silty mixed superactive mesic

mean annual precipitation most of it from september to june soil at the site is a walla walla silt loam coarse silty mixed superactive mesic typic haploxeroll with 15 clay 58 silt and 27 sand soil survey staff 2022 with 0 7 1 2 organic carbon measured by combustion mean daily air temperature is 0 5 c during january and 20 c during july and august in 2012 2013 and 2014 two 81 cm wide undercutter sweeps haybuster duratech industries international jamestown nd were mounted on the three point hitch of a small tractor the sweep blades were set to operate 10 cm below the soil surface creating a soil mulch of about 13 cm this produced individual plot widths of 1 6 m and the plots were 30 m long the tillage timing treatments were randomized in side by side plots in each of four replicate blocks soil cloddiness varied somewhat depending on surface soil moisture but the goal was that the untilled soil below the sweep depth would be completely covered by a mix of fine soil and clods depending on the year and location as many as seven tillage timings from march through july spring through mid summer were performed each on a new untilled plot an additional plot in each block was never tilled and this served as a comparison representing no till fallow weeds were controlled with herbicides or by hand the experiment was continued at the lind site for another three years in 2017 2018 and 2019 using a commercial size undercutter sweep implement in 7 30 m individual plots and with a phoenix rolling harrow attached behind the sweeps the purpose of the attached rolling harrow was to break up larger soil clods and help fill air voids in the tillage much in this last 3 year period there were only four tillage timing treatments spaced about 21 days apart tillage was delayed if recent rain had produced excessively moist surface soil also in these final three years at lind the plot area was planted to winter wheat using standard deep furrow practices schillinger 2001 in late august after 13 months of fallow and harvested the following july with a plot combine to compare grain yield among treatments the single pass of the undercutter sweep buries some of the surface residue compared to the untilled state typically about one third of the surface residue left at harvest is still on the soil surface after minimum tillage in the following spring schillinger 2001 incremental soil samples to 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 20 25 30 35 40 and 45 cm soil depths were taken at seeding time using a 5 cm diameter coring tube starting in 2013 soil coring in 20 cm increments below 45 cm was extended to 180 cm or as deep as the hydraulic probe would penetrate which was sometimes limited by caliche or very dry soil soil water was determined by loss in a drying oven at 105 c comparing soil water between a tilled soil and an untilled soil presents a problem caused by the difference in soil bulk density that occurs immediately upon tillage the soil surface is raised and samples measured from that raised surface contain less soil than they would from the un tilled surface it is also difficult to accurately locate an uneven soil surface for those reasons equivalent mass depths were used to calculate the depth of each soil sample based on the cumulative dry mass of each soil core increment wuest 2009 soil water content was interpolated between successive depths to compute water storage representing the exact same soil mass per unit area the customary linear depth from the soil surface is provided for reference based on the overall average mass to cm depth relationship of untilled soil 2 1 graphing this experiment has treatments that are on a continuous date scale as the tillage dates varied from year to year and sometimes location to location for this reason the treatment means are joined by lines which show how the resulting soil water at seeding time varied with timing of tillage individual measurements from each replicate are plotted to show the scatter around the mean 2 2 statistical analysis our working hypothesis was there would be a particular timing of soil mulch creation each year which would maximize seed zone water and a timing of soil mulch creation that would maximize total water storage at time of winter wheat seeding in late summer september the tillage timings each year were spaced several weeks apart but we also considered soil conditions since it was considered unrealistic to till while the soil surface was still damp from a recent rain and redistribution downward was likely ongoing given experience from the first three years the last three year s tillage timings were limited to four timings approximately 21 days apart for analysis we chose timings from the first three years that most closely matched the last three years herein called uniform at echo in 2014 the fourth uniform timing is missing the effect of tillage date on gravimetric water at specific depths in the seed zone and cumulative soil water from the surface to four depths at seeding time was explored using a linear mixed model with year and location as random effects to look for significant trends that might predict best tillage timing practices water storage to four depths for all 12 site years and all tillage timings were examined using linear regression with location and year as random effects only tillage timings before june 29 day of year 180 were considered because later timings are assumed impractical and unnecessary except in the rare case of a year with significant rainfall into july winter wheat grain yield measured only in the last three years was analyzed for tillage timing effects using analysis of variance and tukey s honest significant difference hsd 3 results 3 1 seed zone water soil water at four

earliest tillage timing produced the highest gravimetric water at seeding time in the surface layers these were instances of substantially less soil water in the deeper soil profile fig 2 in general plots that had been tilled did not appear to respond to later rain as well as plots not yet tilled and sometimes plots tilled after significant rain did not respond as much as plots tilled a treatment or two later fig 1 during long periods where little or no rain occurred treatments not yet tilled consistently lost surface water compared to tilled treatments another observation is the high surface water content at all seed zone depths at the echo site in 2013 this can be explained by the rain before sampling in combination with high levels of soil water in the deeper profile fig 2 3 2 deep soil

4 4 implications for summer fallow practices our results have important implications for maximizing water storage and seed zone water where winter wheat needs to be planted deep to emerge at the end of a long dry fallow period for optimum grain yield potential tillage can be delayed without losing substantial soil water if even small rain events occur prior to tillage and delaying tillage improves storage efficiency of late spring and early summer rainfall an additional advantage to delayed tillage is improved weed control under hotter drier conditions once the soil has been tilled the dust created by ground sprayer applications reduces the effectiveness of herbicides so further tillage is the preferred method of controlling weed flushes that come later delaying tillage until the advent of dry summer months reduces the number of tillage passes required for weed control following the initial primary tillage often only one tillage pass is needed which preserves surface residue and soil aggregation this is important for reduced soil crusting and erosion and improved water infiltration funding this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the

9327,thermal images of plants have been used as a way for monitoring water status since it does provide a non destructive method that allows its remote evaluation even with the facilities provided it does require a high level of expertise for a human to evaluate these images and this is a time consuming task in this context machine learning techniques are crucial tools that can automatically evaluate the images and predict the water status of plants with more accuracy and as fast as possible to deal with the dynamic in time and space of agriculture fields in this work a method for the evaluation of thermal images of sugarcane crop predicting its water status is proposed the method can be used to evaluate thermal images taken with any type of portable thermal camera available on the market today for this an artificial neural network model is used inception resnet v2 network that is a kind of a deep learning model combined with the transfer learning technique that allow archive high accuracy with low time and cost compared with traditional methods the proposed model performance was compared to a human evaluating the same set of thermal images overall results showed that the developed system achieved superior performance compared to the assessments made by the human and aided in classifying the water stress of plant s thermal images in a non destructive manner in addition to superior performance accuracy by 23 17 and 14 for the awc classes of 25 50 and 100 respectively the deep learning model demonstrated a greater ability to distinguish between the classes of thermal stress thus the system developed in this study is a less time consuming affordable non destructive and effective tool for estimating the water status of sugarcane plants in the field based on thermal images keywords water deficit thermal images neural network deep learning 1 introduction sustainability in agricultural production depends on the environmental consequences of water usage and land resources such as cultivated areas and the prevention of salinization aiming to maintain the long term use of resources at adequate levels for food production garcía tejero et al 2017 with the constant growth of the world s population and the growing global scarcity of water the design and development of efficient methods for assessing water stress in crops become an important prerequisite for performing the correct programming of precision irrigation in order to avoid water waste and promote increases in productivity zhou et al 2021 water stress is of particular importance as it is the main abiotic stress responsible for causing losses in agricultural yields martínez romero et al 2017 appropriate management of water availability in the production system supply of the exact amount of water required by plants maintenance of soil moisture at desired levels and optimum use of resources such as water and energy has received attention by several researchers elsayed et al 2017 garcía tejero et al 2017 dias martins et al 2018 toscano et al 2018 the use of thermal images as a tool to investigate identify and monitor water stress during a crop cycle can help farmers with water management indicating possible zones of yield decline due to variability of water availability in soil garcía tejero et al 2017 crop sensing technologies have great potential as tools for monitoring the amount of water present in plants enabling the prediction of productivity increasing the efficiency of use of this resource and the precision of irrigation management craparo et al 2017 o shaughnessy et al 2011 useful information for decision making during handling plants can be obtained through infrared thermography which has been used in agriculture as a non invasive and versatile tool to monitor biotic pests and diseases and abiotic stresses nutrient and water deficits o shaughnessy et al 2011 highly efficient water usage in crop production can be achieved by combining efficient agronomic management strategies and highly precise and accurate technological tools to determine the physiological parameters of irrigated crops throughout their cycle thereby reducing physiological stresses which may impair the productive efficiency of each plant lopes et al 2017 zhuang et al 2017 used thermal images of maize plants to detect water stress in plants at the initial stage the authors used three levels of treatment well irrigated reduced irrigation and drought stressed the detection of water stress was based on a supervised learning algorithm the gradient boosting decision tree gbdt the precision of recognition of treatments was 80 95 and the accuracy in estimating water stress was 90 39 according to the authors the results showed that the proposed method had an effective and adequate performance for detecting water stress in corn plants at the initial stage of development accessibility to low cost thermal cameras provides a powerful tool to quickly and nondestructively detect and quantify crop water status according to zhou et al 2021 this technology combined with machine learning approaches has a future perspective for assessing water stress in crops of agricultural interest aiming at food security and environmental sustainability using machine learning applied to digital images to determine water stress in cultures of interest kaneda et al 2017 zhuang et al 2017 na et al 2019 jiang et al 2019 giménez gallego et al 2020 zhuang et al 2020 conducted studies classifying water stress into three levels ideal humidity moderate stress and advanced stress where machine learning approaches achieved favorable performance in identifying and classifying the water status in the plant with accuracy from 83 11 to 98 84 in the agricultural sciences it has been growing the usage of computational and remote sensing techniques to perform tasks such as data collection and task automation however manpower is still needed for certain tasks that require complex reasoning and knowledge about potentially subtle interactions which are not easily quantifiable amalgamated from years of experience such as interpretation of thermal images dias martins et al 2018 lecun et al 1998 as the new technologies rise research been developing mechanisms to reduce the human need at tasks like water assessment giménez gallego et al 2020 conducted a study to determine the crop water stress index cwsi using digital images of the canopy of a culture applying trained foot models of deep machine learning and in vector support machine svm na et al 2019 used a deep convolutional neural system cnnd to identify and classify water stress in corn crop the authors studied only two classifications of the water state of the crop optimum humidity and moderate water stress the thermic images of the corn plants were captured every two hours throughout the day by digital cameras a traditional machine learning gradient boosting decision tree gbdt was used for comparison purposes in the same set of images jiang et al 2019 proposed an automatic detection system of water stress during the middle stage of corn crop growth the authors used different directions and wavelengths of the gabor filter and a panasonic wv sw396 ah 720p camera to obtain the terse images the authors studied 5 different levels of water stress the images were applied in a convolutional neural network for extraction and classification of the characteristics kaneda et al 2017 used a new regression model multi modal sw svr based on multimodal vector support for accurate prediction of water stress in plants from two data environmental data and thermic images the proposed method used two technologies sw svr and a deep neural network dnn as a resource extractor accessibility to thermal images and machine learning techniques offer an alternative with a fast and reliable future perspective to detect and quantify the water stress of a crop zhou et al 2021 however in general these models require a long time for training and adjusting the parameters yosinski et al 2014 obtaining training data that matches the feature space and predicted data distribution characteristics of the test data can be difficult and expensive in certain circumstances of study in view of this there is a need to create a high performance learner for a target domain trained from a related source domain this is the stimulus for transfer learning weiss et al 2016 traditional machine learning methodologies presume that the training data and testing data are taken from the same domain such that the input feature space and data distribution characteristics are the same nevertheless in some real world machine learning circumstances this assumption is not true in some cases training data can be expensive or difficult to collect is this way there is a need to create high performance learners trained with more easily obtained data from different domains this methodology is referred to as transfer learning weiss et al 2016 considering these limitations the transfer learning technique is indicated to decrease the costs involved in the training it takes the advantage of the knowledge acquired from other databases training of related domains this is justified by the fact that a model learns several characteristics of a database that can be applied for other purposes that is the basic knowledge already exists it is only necessary to refine it alemi et al 2016 transfer learning technique requires a large amount of data for training in addition to that already used therefore it becomes possible to reduce the training time because the network has already been previously trained yosinski et al 2014 a limitation stems from drawbacks in the algorithm or model architecture as it is necessary to maintain the same network topology of the model previously adopted to use the knowledge acquired from previous training oliveira and romero 2018 in normal scenarios the requirement of transfer learning occurs when there is a limited supply of target training data this is possible to happen because the data can be rare the data being expensive to collect and label or the data being inaccessible with big data repositories becoming more prevalent using existing datasets that are related to but not exactly the same as a target domain of interest makes transfer learning solutions an attractive approach there are many machine learning applications that transfer learning has been successfully applied to including text sentiment classification wang and mahadevan 2011 image classification duan et al 2012 kulis et al 2011 zhu et al 2011 human activity classification harel and mannor 2011 software defect classification nam and kim 2015 and multi language text classification zhou et al 2014 prettenhofer and stein 2010 zhu et al 2011 the techniques of data mining and machine learning has been widely and successfully used in many applications where patterns from past information training data can be extracted in order to predict future outcomes witten et al 2011 in a scenario where transfer learning is applied and considering an example where two people want to learn to play the piano one person has no previous experience playing music and the other has extensive musical knowledge playing the guitar a person with extensive musical background will be able to learn piano more efficiently than someone else transferring previously learned musical knowledge to the task of learning to play the piano pan and yang 2010 a person is able to take information from a previously learned task and use it in a beneficial way to learn a related task making the learning process easier faster and more efficient in august 2016 inception resnet v2 was made available by google in order to encourage innovation in the area of image recognition along with the state of the art network its most recently trained model and the imagenet database used for training was also made available alemi et al 2016 imagenet russakovsky et al 2015 refers to an ongoing project that aims to provide researchers access to large databases of images currently the project has 10 million images representing over 10 000 categories of objects the dataset used to pre train the mentioned model has 1 2 million images with 1000 categories and 150 000 images reserved for testing and validation among these categories there are not only plants and fruits but also various objects such as animals food and even clothes alemi et al 2016 using the transfer learning technique oliveira and romero 2018 used the inception resnet v2 model to identify cocoa fruits at the time of harvest the authors observed that after training the network was able to identify the ripe fruits with 89 accuracy recently several authors pôças et al 2017 romero et al 2018 poblete et al 2020 kumar et al 2020 used information from multispectral and hyperspectral sensors combined with neural network techniques to perform efficient monitoring of water stress in crops of agronomic interest however these technologies are difficult to access of high cost and complexity hindering accessibility and usability by the end user in this case the farmer producer these technologies are possible to be used only by scientific communities in a restricted way the present work stands out for the innovation regarding the hybrid use of the deep machine learning approach using the inception resnet v2 network specific for the determination of water stress in a culture of agronomic interest in this case sugarcane it uses a thermal image coming from a low cost camera of easy access in a quickly and nondestructively way allowing strategic decision making in order to avoid productivity losses and water waste rapid and non destructive monitoring of crop water stress is necessary to support precision irrigation management usually the existing method available for agronomic proposes to determine the water needs of a culture are rudimentary slow and manual even more they are highly complex and require specialized and trained professionals to operate specific laboratory instruments gutiérrez et al 2018 at this paper we present a developed method that does uses two current technologies in a hybrid way thermal images that is easy to access and machine learning to offer an alternative of the traditional methods to monitor the water needs of a culture the proposed method allows fast and non destructive monitoring of crop water stress in order to support precision irrigation management inspired by deep machine learning a convolutional neural network cnn is applied to thermal images for recognition and classification of the water status of sugarcane culture it was developed for the prediction of water status using thermal images and inception resnet v2 network differing from existing implementation by the use of transfer learning and low cost camera the method is applied to thermal images captured from a simple hardware since it does resize the image to the network requirement the prediction of the water status of a plant at the presented image is classified in one of the 3 classes used at the model training favorable adequate and unfavorable the database was composed of 4050 images collected during 120 days 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and irrigation management the experiment was conducted at the department of biosystems engineering in the university of são paulo usp esalq piracicaba brazil fig 1 latitude 22 42 30 south longitude 47 38 00 west altitude 546 m with sugarcane seedlings in contained boxes large pots with dimensions 0 92 m wide 1 08 m long and 0 65 m high a layer of gravel 5 cm thick was placed at the bottom of the boxes and covered by a geotextile blanket ntc brazil a pvc pipe 25 mm in diameter was installed drilled coated on the bottom by the same geotextile blanket and buried vertically in the soil serving as an access pipe for draining the vessels while maintaining a protected environment in the event of excessive water applications uniformity irrigation tests were carried out including all drippers in the experiment using christiansen s coefficient of uniformity and uniformity of 97 4 was obtained the treatment used in the experiment consisted of three irrigation levels corresponding to 25 50 and 100 of soil available water capacity awc fig 2 each irrigation row was composed of eight repetitions for a total of 24 plots repetitions comprised of five plants each the control of the irrigation levels was based on soil parameters table 1 and monitoring was performed using six sets of three tensiometers arranged at depths of 0 15 0 25 and 0 35 m tensiometers readings were recorded daily together with the replacement of water aiming at uniformity among treatments the replacement of the water at the parcels was done daily the soil used to fill the boxes was classified as red yellow latosol sandy phase to determine the physical hydric parameters of the soil water retention curve van genuchten 1980 by the camera richards method table 1 undisturbed samples of three layers were collected 0 0 20 0 20 0 40 and 0 40 0 60 m and analyzed in the esalq usp soil laboratory the soil water retention curve is a physical attribute that expressed as the relationship between matric potential kpa and soil water content the parameters obtained from the soil water retention curve were used in irrigation management tensiometer readings were transformed into soil water potential ψ m eq 1 and moisture values estimated based on van genuchten 1980 equation eq 2 based on the estimate of the soil moisture corresponding to the current tension the water replacement values are calculated to refill the soil profile at field capacity level for the reference plots 100 awc subsequently enabling to quantify fractions of this reference for the remaining irrigation levels of this study 50 and 25 awc the soil matrix potential ψ m is 1 ψ m l t h c where lt is the tensiometer reading kpa and h c is the water column height in tensiometer tubes

matrix potential in kpa for each treatment the irrigation levels il were designed to restore soil moisture to the field capacity θfc determined for each soil layer and the total water reposition was calculated as the result of the sum of the required level in each individual soil layer according to eq 3 the irrigation level il required to increase the soil moisture to field capacity mm is given

parcel receiving the treatment was fixed during all the experiment and the water status associated with the collected image was grounded on the treatment been applied 2 2 database for training for the database creation the experiment was conducted over 120 days starting on 11 august 2019 during the initial 30 days of the experiment all plots were irrigated with water reposition to maintain a level of 100 awc in the soil to standardize the plot conditions and leaf mass growth immediately after the 30 days partial water replenishment began 50 and 25 using the predefined irrigation levels on the fifth day when the plots were stabilized at the desired water levels the acquisition of thermal images began they were captured taken five images from different positions angle and distance in each plot at arbitrary times of the day the variation of the time and position to collect was intended to provide as much as variance in the images with the propose better training the network simulating field condition along with the images labeling was performed based on the water regime applied in the experimental plot of origin examples of images comprising the database are presented in fig 3 at the end of the experiment the database created for the training was composed of 4050 images with 1350 from each of the applied irrigation levels the images were captured at different times of the day between 9 am and 3 pm using a flir camera fitted to a cellphone flir one pro lt for usb flir usa the choice of this camera was based on its low cost and the fact that the images were stored on a device capable of executing the model for future predictions providing a tool accessible to small and medium sized producers this camera has a dynamic scene range between 20 c and 120 c thermal sensitivity of 100 mk image and video saved at a thermal resolution of 80 60 the accuracy of 3 c or 5 c and a video frame rate of 8 7 hz an iron pallet color with a fixed range was applied to the images and matt emissivity was used 2 3 neural network training to evaluate the transfer learning technique in the problem analyzed in this study a deep learning neural network was selected for this purpose a convolutional neural network cnn named by inception resnet v2 network was chosen due to its good performance in classifying objects present in an image unlike other cnns the inception resnet v2 network uses several convolution filters in an image instead of choosing a suitable filter for the type of data analyzed alemi et al 2016 three filters 5 5 3 3 and 1 1 are applied to the image and all results are concatenated thereby allowing the model to extract general 5 5 filter and local 1 1 filter features other characteristics of this network are the residual connections that reduces the chances of information loss and performance reduction however it is dependent on adequate optimization of model parameters alemi et al 2016 this occurs because each of the layers acts as an identity map propagating only the resources previously learned or refining them that is the input of a layer is added to its result inception resnet v2 is a deep learning network consisting of 185 convolutional blocks divided into 50 layers and contains only one fully connected block oliveira and romero 2018 initially the parameter values obtained at its last training by using the imagenet database were configured using hardware equipped with a geforce rtx 2080 ti gpu card with 11 g of ddr6 memory 4352 cuda cores and a frequency of 1350 mhz the free software tensorflow and its sub libraries used by its abstraction models neural network architecture and packages for the transformation of the databases were used to build train optimize and evaluate the model python was the programming language adopted for network training the implemented algorithm to perform the training was split into three stages preparation of dataset training the model using initial parameter values using transfer learning and evaluating the trained model the implementation stages are showed in fig 4 in the first stage thermal images were resized to resolutions of 320 240 pixels with three color channels rgb and vectorized then the image dataset collected during the experiment was split into two and converted to tfrecord format with 70 and 30 of images used for training and model testing validation respectively in the second stage the inception resnet v2 model was imported and loaded with model weights from it last training weights presented in alemi et al 2016 this included the weights of all 50 dense layers and 185 convolutional blocks as the original model was trained to classify 1000 classes the weights of the upper dense layer were discarded and the number of neurons was adapted to accommodate the three classes in this study which were 25 50 and 100 of awc the images of the training set were presented to the network in batches of 10 images for 1000 epochs the softmax function with cross entropy was used as a cost function this uses the upper layer tensor as an input parameter applies the softmax function and then calculates the cross entropy kingma and adam 2014 adam s optimization was also used an algorithm to update the learning rate during cnn training this is a suitable augmentation for the vast majority of cnns and is an algorithm available in the tensorflow library kingma and adam 2014 the exponential decay learning rate schedule was also applied with the highest possible value at the beginning of training being 0 0001 in the third stage the trained model was used to predict the water stress classes of the images in the validation set this final stage aimed to assess the accuracy of the model when it was applied to images not used during the model training phase 2 4 human evaluation to compare the classifications performed by the model after training using initial parameter values assigned using the transfer learning technique an evaluation of the set of 1008 images used for validation of the inception resnet v2 model was carried out by an human calculating the water stress index of the crop cwsi and labeling each image as belonging to 25 50 or 100 awc class plant temperature is one of the most used physiological indicators by the scientific community to provide information on the state of water in the plant gonzalez teruel et al 2019 torres sanchez et al 2020 the stomatal aperture which is directly influenced by the state of water in the plant and in the soil affects the temperature of the leaves as it acts as a cooling mechanism by controlling the evapotranspiration the higher the crop water stress the lower the stomatal aperture in order to prevent the plant from water exhaustion thus leading to an increase of leaf temperature the crop water stress index idso et al 1981 is extensively used to account for the crop stress camino et al 2018 garcía tejero et al 2018 krishna et al 2019 noguera et al 2020 giménez gallego et al 2021 by comparing the differences of temperature between the air and canopy fully transpiring leaf and non transpiring leaf image analysis was performed using the flir tools software made available by the manufacturer of the thermal camera used to capture the images used in this study fig 3 the use of the software was necessary to tabulate the temperature values of the areas of interest according to the methodology proposed by idso et al 1981 and jackson et al 1981 for calculating the cwsi eq5 tdry and twet represent respectively the maximum and minimum temperatures a non transpiring leaf tdry or a fully transpiring leaf twet can reach in those specific climatic conditions wind speed solar radiation relative humidity and air temperature as introduced by jones 2009 and the average temperature of the area o interesting was used to calculate the temperature of the canopy jones et al 2009 grant at al 2007 from the temperature data obtained from each image the water stress index of the crop cwsi was calculated by 5 cwsi t c t wet t dry t wet 5 where t wet is the leaf temperature without water stress t dry is the leaf temperature under water stress and t c is the temperature of the leaf representing the canopy since the deep learning neural network is used for image classification a method was sought to transform the cwsi values calculated in each one of the images into classes that represent water status based on the awc of the soil and plant development thus the lowest value 0 obtained from eq 5 was attributed to the best water condition for the plant the maximum expected value is 1 representing the worst condition the interval of cwsi water stress composed by the range between 0 1 was divided accordingly to assign labels to each interval according to camargo and hubbard 1999 proposed by ciiagro 2020 and it is shown in table 3 as three irrigation levels were adopted during the experiment a correlation was obtained for each with the classes presented in table 4 2 5 comparative results as the deep learning neural network is used for classification tasks classic statistical methods for analyzing the performance of models such as the r2 agreement index and the rmse are not applicable for comparing the performance a classification between the manual method and the use of the inception resnet v2 model other statistical methods were used to evaluate the performance of inception resnet v2 model these were applied to the network after training by using the starting parameter values obtained from transfer learning as well as the classification carried out by a human bean metrics that are best adequate for the evaluation of classifying predictions are recall precision and accuracy obtained from confusion matrix and graphical analyses using the receiver operating characteristics roc and area under the curve auc giraldo gonzález et al 2020 the confusion matrix presents the classification frequencies for each class of the model a way of representing the quality obtained from a digital image classification congalton 1991 it is a square matrix that expresses the relationship between the number of sample units assigned to a particular category of two classifications in this matrix the lines represent the reference data real value and the columns represent the prediction obtained with the classification method in a confusion matrix the frequency observed on the diagonal nii represents the elements classified correctly the marginal column n i represents the total number of elements classified for category i table 5 labels are the known classifications predicted are the evaluations of models false and true are the classes being analyzed according to congalton 1991 if the matrix is poorly constructed the evaluation of the model will be incorrect therefore the following factors must be considered for the construction of a matrix pattern unit and the number of samples these factors provide essential information for the evaluation of the confusion matrix from the confusion matrix it is possible to generate performance indicators for the model evaluated such as accuracy recall and precision accuracy indicates how many classifications the model predicted correctly this is the ratio between the sum of the correct predictions true positives with true negatives over the sum of the predictions eq 6 6 acuracy tp tn tp tn tn fp correct predictions total predictions two other indicators that assist in the evaluation of the model refer to precision and recall according to savoy 1997 precision eq 7 refers to the proportion of identifications that are correct and recall eq 8 refers to the proportion of real positives identified correctly 7 precision tp tp fp 8 recall tp tp fn from the precision and recall values it is possible to calculate the f score measure eq 9 which is a harmonic mean that represents the balance between the model s precision and sensitivity savoy 1997 9 f score 2 precision recall precision recall roc analysis is a graphical method for assessing organizing and selecting predictive and or diagnostic systems it was originally used in signal detection to evaluate the quality of the transmission of a signal on a noisy channel egan 1975 it has also been used in climatological analysis to assess the quality of rare event predictions mylne 2002 and for economic analyses of incomes gastwirth 1971 the roc curve fig 5 was obtained from the plot for a given class of the number of correct classifications recall on the abscissa axis and on the ordinate axis the number of false positives nfp eq 10 some components of fig 5 are important the origin 0 0 represents the strategy of never classifying a sample as positive models corresponding to this point do not produce any erroneous classification but neither are they are capable of predicting a correct classification a model that implements the opposite strategy of always classifying a sample as being from one class is represented by the point 1 1 that predicts that all examples are belonging to that class producing a high number of false classifications point 0 1 represents the perfect model in which all classes are correctly identified and point 1 0 refers to the model that always makes incorrect predictions based on these criteria models close to the lower left corner of the graph can be considered conservative because they make a classification with great certainty producing a low number of errors in the classifications models close to the top right can be considered liberal with high rates of success and errors in this manner the ascending diagonal from 0 0 to 1 1 represents a stochastic model where each point can be represented by p per where p is the class probability and per 1 p thus models belonging to the upper left triangle on this diagonal represent models that perform better than random and models belonging to the lower right triangle are worse than random jackson et al 1981 3 results and discussion 3 1 human evaluation the image classifications were known a priori due to the strictly controlled water regime throughout the experiment after evaluating the images and having them classified by a human bean the number of correct and incorrect predictions of the model were computed statistical analysis was performed for each of the existing classes in the experiment as well as for all classes the results calculated using eq 6 showed that the human was unable to identify 34 38 and 22 of the images of plants subjected to 25 50 and 100 awc respectively then it was obtained an overall accuracy of 68 fig 6 differently from the works developed by kaneda et al 2017 zhuang et al 2020 jiang et al 2019 in which they used a traditional neural network to compare the accuracy of the proposed models this work proposes the comparison and verification of the substitution of manual human analysis by a more accurate and rapidly determining technology aiming at strategic basis in precision irrigation and not only a comparison between machine learning methods as the other authors during the implementation of this task it was possible to observe the dependence on knowledge of the image locations that would represent the current state of the plant for 25 awc level this challenge stemmed from the low amount of leaf of the plant under treatment of the levels of 25 and 50 awc from the seventieth day of the experiment the higher error value for the 50 awc level can be explained by the possibility of classifying images as either 25 or 100 if the location for collecting the temperature information is not well defined demonstrating the requirement of the background of the person doing the manual evaluation and how human evaluation are more propense to errored classification the high level of accuracy for the 100 awc level can be explained by the high leaf mass developed by the plants under this irrigation regime facilitating image analysis throughout the cycle overall 32 of the images were assessed as being incorrectly labeled a similar result can be observed at jiménez bello et al 2011 in which developed an automated system for detection of water status at citrus its conception was composed of 44 thermal images canopy temperatures as the hydric potential of the plants for each image were evaluated manually as well using the linear regression reg available at sas software the results presented show better performance for the automated method presenting a r2 0 81 while the manual process was able to archive r2 0 78 collaborating with the results found at this paper the canopy temperature was also used by casary et al 2019 to investigate the detection of water stress at sugarcane in greenhouse condition demonstrating that canopy temperature ct is recognized as a useful tool for water stress detection thermography could be an alternative way yet few reports are available on its use in sugarcane also the ct readings and the thermal images acquired from the thermal camera were considered useful for water stress detection in sugarcane under the greenhouse condition and that irrigation should be performed petrie et al 2019 carried out a study to assess the water status in irrigated grape cultivars under different water regimes using the low cost thermal camera coupled to a smartphone the minitab 18 software was used to analyze the image data through regression analysis to estimate the temperature of the copy and the sheets for calculating the cwsi index and the stomatal conductance index the authors concluded that the best prediction performance found was for the cwsi index as it does not require meteorological data entry the evaluation is made just analyzing the image no extra information the r2 correlation index was 0 61 between the stomatal conductance index and the water potential of the measured stem and 0 74 for the cwsi the authors also concluded that the use of low cost thermals coupled to smartphones has the potential to be an easy and accessible tool for assessing the water status in the plant and for making better irrigation decisions 3 2 trained model evaluation three metrics were used to evaluate the model the first being the accuracy rate achieved by the network during its training the second being the accuracy rate of the network when evaluating the 30 of the images that were not presented to the network during the training and the third was the change in training accuracy to evaluate the usage of transfer learning according to fig 7 the network begins with an accuracy of approximately 40 and the accuracies increase gradually which indicates that the initial parameter values obtained using the described method are suitable for model training for the intended purpose classifying thermal images as the training progressed and the parameter values were adjusted there was an increase in accuracy reaching a value of 91 after 150 000 epochs similar results are demonstrated by oliveira and romero 2018 in which it was used the transfer learning at the same network to detect cocoa pods ready to starve in this work was presented that after training of the network with samples of cocoa pods the network was able to detect 82 of the samples presented for the validation of the training regarding to the accuracy achieved by the network when applied to the group of separate images for validation an accuracy of 82 was obtained this level of accuracy is in line with the value obtained by the network during its training and demonstrates that after the new training the network was successful in recognizing the classes of interest for the domain of this study in this case status water stress for a thermal image of sugarcane plat during the validation phase the prosed method evaluate 1000 images in less than a minute while a human evaluation does take 160 h similar results for a machine learn method were obtained by kaneda et al 2017 zhuang et al 2020 jiang et al 2019 in et al 2019 in which machine learning approaches achieved favorable performance in identifying and classifying the water status in the plant with accuracy from 83 11 to 98 84 blaya ros et al 2020 carried out a similar study to assess the water status of young cherry trees submitted to different levels of water stress the author used thermal images obtained by a low cost device to estimate the cwsi index the water potential value of the stem was used as a sensitive indicator of water stress in the plant and was used as a comparison of the values obtained by the use of thermal images the authors found a strong relationship between the cwsi index and the water potential of the stem they concluded that the use of thermal images obtained from low cost devices provided reliable data that were used to estimate the state of the water in the plant in the cherry crop 3 3 evaluation comparison a comparison between the manual and the proposed system using deep learning network inception resnet v2 was carried out for the classification of the images in the test set which were specifically separated from the training set beforehand for this task following an industry standard of validation and training set creation recommended for evaluating model performance to determine which of the methods showed greater efficiency in the classification of the images used the comparison between both methods was performed using the mentioned metrics recall precision and accuracy and roc and auc graphs in table 6 is presented the confusion matrix for the assessments made by the specialist in table 7 is showed the confusion matrix generated for the assessment carried out by the neural network the roc and uac analyses have been widely used for the comparison between automated classification methods and humans as well as between different classifications methods chung et al 2018 apply this analysis for the proximal humerus fracture detection by groups of specialist and automated method using the neural network karimi rizvandi et al 2021 does use the analyses for a self learning bayesian network model comparison among metaheuristic algorithms the evaluation of the classification of images using the deep learning neural network after training showed 19 greater accuracy compared to classification by the specialist tables 6 and 7 in which actual is the known label for the example prediction is the evaluation of the model 25 awc 50 awc 100 awc are the irrigation levels other factors are the best precision values for the model which were higher than the manual classification by 23 17 and 14 for the awc classes of 25 50 and 14 respectively when analyzing the recall rates the deep neural network was 4 27 and 25 higher in the 25 50 and 100 awc classes respectively demonstrating its higher ability to distinguish between the classes another factor that confirms the superiority of the deep neural network is the f score table 8 which values are 14 22 and 19 higher for the 25 50 and 100 awc classes respectively showing an improved balance between recall and accuracy in a similar study zhuang et al 2020 conducted a study to monitor the water status of maize crop using a set of 656 thermal images of plants under different levels of water stress classified as well irrigated moderately irrigated and with water stress a convolutional neural network cnn was applied to the images to perform the diagnosis and classification of water stress levels the method achieved satisfactory classification performance with accuracy of 88 41 showing the superiority of the technology developed over traditional agronomic techniques for the same purpose giménez gallego using svm concluded that the deep learning model presented an accuracy rate of 86 27 while the smv was 83 11 also according to the authors the machine learning model presented better accuracy as there was an increase in the set of images analyzed while the smv proved to be more efficient regarding the reduced time to prepare the data for the roc analysis of both methods the points for each class were calculated using the one against all analysis and plotted as shown in fig 8 as defined by the roc analysis models close to the point 0 1 show greater quality in the assessments for the problem analyzed note that the proposed model trained with initial parameter values set using the transfer learning procedure obtained values closer to this point for all classes thus confirming the greater performance of the cnn compared to the manual method for a better understanding of the results obtained simulations of the roc curves were generated for each training and the auc was calculated as the classification performed has three classes and the number of curves grows exponentially with the number of classes prati et al 2008 the one against all analysis technique was adopted to evaluate the ability of both methods to distinguish between each class of interest na et al 2019 by placing a new method using dcnn and comparing with gbdt they concluded that the proposed method showed superior performance than traditional presenting accuracy in the identification and classification of water stress of 98 14 and 95 95 respectively also according to the authors the proposed approach based on deep machine learning proved to be a robust and promising method for the identification of water stress in corn crop enforcing the separability capacity of dcnn presented at the roc evaluation also using cnn jiang et al 2019 present that it presented accuracy for classification of water stress in corn plants of 98 84 although according to the authors the method has adaptability to lighting and angle transformation and can also adapt to the actual field condition larger auc values imply a better ability of the model to distinguish between the classes of interest it was observed that the auc of the cnn method for the 25 awc class fig 9 was 90 being 10 greater than the manual method both methods showed a similar ability to distinguish between classes in the 50 awc class with a difference of only 1 fig 10 being 64 for manual prediction and 65 for cnn prediction this could be attributed to the images belonging to the 50 awc class erroneously being classified as belonging to the 25 or 100 classes for the 100 awc class fig 11 the proposed model was superior to the manual method by 14 the simulations showed that it produces a larger area under the curve confirming its better ability to separate classes of interest as presented by wang et al 2010 the success of this procedure relies on the assumption that both optical ir image alignment and leaf area extraction are perfect in practice such assumptions are rarely justifiable and the computed result can often be found undesirable several authors have successfully used deep neural network approaches to predict crop water stress obtaining correlation indexes r2 between real and estimated physiological indicators of 0 65 and 0 93 king and shellie 2016 salvador gutiérrez et al 2018 romero et al 2018 deep machine learning approaches achieved favorable performance in classifying water status in plants with an accuracy of 83 11 98 84 zhuang et al 2017 an et al 2019 jiang et al 2019 giménez gallego et al 2020 zhoi et al 2021 kumar et al 2020 developed two models of deep neural networks to predict the cwsi index using air temperature relative humidity and canopy temperature data obtained in thermal images according to zhou et al 2021 the accessibility to thermal imaging and machine learning techniques offer a fast and reliable future perspective for detecting and quantifying the water stress of a crop to support irrigation planning corroborating with the results presents at this paper in the future works we propose to use a larger number of irrigation levels and cameras with higher image quality for comparison of results obtained using images from a low cost camera 4 conclusion in this work we proposed a method that uses a deep learning neural network inception resnet v2 trained with transfer learning technique and thermal images to predict water stress in sugarcane crop the method was able to classify 1000 images in less than a minute the same task performed by a human specialist took 90 h and was less accuracy showing that the methodology developed presented significant reduction in time for the predictions with high accuracy 83 the use of transfer learning technique helped in the training of the network by reducing the time and resources required and demonstrated the high accuracies as in the beginning of the training as well as in the final at the validation steps when compared to a human manual specialist the proposed method showed be superior in precision and separation capability supporting the usage cnns for determining water stress as consequence the proposed model could be used by farmers for the plant water status determination reducing the time for the diagnostic not requiring knowledge from the user and can be applied for remote prediction of plant water status in the field demonstrating that the hybrid uses of the technologies of thermal image and machine learning proved to be an advanced and efficient tool for determining the water status of sugarcane culture offering an opportunity for evaluation of water stress at sugarcane that is accessible to the end user of the technology in this case farmers in a fast non destructive and reliable way the results presented in this research indicate a promising possibility of application in the efficient management of irrigation in the near future as well that the machine learn methods perform better than traditional agronomic methods to detect

9327,thermal images of plants have been used as a way for monitoring water status since it does provide a non destructive method that allows its remote evaluation even with the facilities provided it does require a high level of expertise for a human to evaluate these images and this is a time consuming task in this context machine learning techniques are crucial tools that can automatically evaluate the images and predict the water status of plants with more accuracy and as fast as possible to deal with the dynamic in time and space of agriculture fields in this work a method for the evaluation of thermal images of sugarcane crop predicting its water status is proposed the method can be used to evaluate thermal images taken with any type of portable thermal camera available on the market today for this an artificial neural network model is used inception resnet v2 network that is a kind of a deep learning model combined with the transfer learning technique that allow archive high accuracy with low time and cost compared with traditional methods the proposed model performance was compared to a human evaluating the same set of thermal images overall results showed that the

images keywords water deficit thermal images neural network deep learning 1 introduction sustainability in agricultural production depends on the environmental consequences of water usage and land resources such as cultivated areas and the prevention of salinization aiming to maintain the long term use of resources at adequate levels for food production garcía tejero et al 2017 with the constant growth of the world s population and the growing global scarcity of water the design and development of efficient methods for assessing water stress in crops become an important prerequisite for performing the correct programming of precision irrigation in order to avoid water waste and promote increases in productivity zhou et al 2021 water stress is of particular importance as it is the main abiotic stress responsible for causing losses in agricultural yields martínez romero et al 2017 appropriate management of water availability in the production system supply of the exact amount of water required by plants maintenance of soil moisture at desired levels and optimum use of resources such as water and energy has received attention by several researchers elsayed et al 2017 garcía tejero et al 2017 dias martins et al 2018 toscano et al 2018 the use of thermal images as a tool to investigate identify and monitor water stress during a crop cycle can help farmers with water management indicating possible zones of yield decline due to variability of water availability in soil garcía tejero et al 2017 crop sensing technologies have great potential as tools for monitoring the amount of water present in plants enabling the prediction of productivity increasing the efficiency of use of this resource and the precision of irrigation management craparo et al 2017 o shaughnessy et al 2011 useful information for decision making during handling plants can be obtained through infrared thermography which has been used in agriculture as a non invasive and versatile tool to monitor biotic pests and diseases and abiotic stresses nutrient and water deficits o shaughnessy et al 2011 highly efficient water usage in crop production can be achieved by combining efficient agronomic management strategies and highly precise and accurate technological tools to determine the physiological parameters of irrigated crops throughout their cycle thereby reducing physiological stresses which may impair the productive efficiency of each plant lopes et al 2017 zhuang et al 2017 used thermal images of maize plants to detect water stress in plants at the initial stage the authors used three levels of treatment well irrigated reduced irrigation and drought stressed the detection of water stress was based on a supervised learning algorithm the gradient boosting decision tree gbdt the precision of recognition of treatments was 80 95 and the accuracy in estimating water stress was 90 39 according to the authors the results showed that the proposed method had an effective and adequate performance for detecting water stress in corn plants at the initial stage of development accessibility to low cost thermal cameras provides a powerful tool to quickly and nondestructively detect and quantify crop water status according to zhou et al 2021 this technology combined with machine learning approaches has a future perspective for assessing water stress in crops of agricultural interest aiming at food security and environmental sustainability using machine learning applied to digital images to determine water stress in cultures of interest kaneda et al 2017 zhuang et al 2017 na et al 2019 jiang et al 2019 giménez gallego et al 2020 zhuang et al 2020 conducted studies classifying water stress into three levels ideal humidity moderate stress and advanced stress where machine learning approaches achieved favorable performance in identifying and classifying the water status in the plant with accuracy from 83 11 to 98 84 in the agricultural sciences it has been growing the usage of computational and remote sensing techniques to perform tasks such as data collection and task automation however manpower is still needed for certain tasks that require complex reasoning and knowledge about potentially subtle interactions which are not easily quantifiable amalgamated from years of experience such as interpretation of thermal images dias martins et al 2018 lecun et al 1998 as the new technologies rise research been developing mechanisms to reduce the human need at tasks like water assessment giménez gallego et al 2020 conducted a study to determine the crop water stress index cwsi using digital images of the canopy of a culture applying trained foot models of deep machine learning and in vector support machine svm na et al 2019 used a deep convolutional neural system cnnd to identify and classify water stress in corn crop the authors studied only two classifications of the water state of the crop optimum humidity and moderate water stress the thermic images of the corn plants were captured every two hours throughout the day by digital cameras a traditional machine learning gradient boosting decision tree gbdt was used for comparison purposes in the same set of images jiang et al 2019 proposed an automatic detection system of water stress during the middle stage of corn crop growth the authors used different

accessibility to thermal images and machine learning techniques offer an alternative with a fast and reliable future perspective to detect and quantify the water stress of a crop zhou et al 2021 however in general these models require a long time for training and adjusting the parameters yosinski et al 2014 obtaining training data that matches the feature space and predicted data distribution characteristics of the test data can be difficult and expensive in certain circumstances of study in view of this there is a need to create a high performance learner for a target domain trained from a related source domain this is the stimulus for transfer learning weiss et al 2016 traditional machine learning methodologies presume that the training data and testing data are taken from the same domain such that the input feature space and data distribution characteristics are the same nevertheless in some real world machine learning circumstances this assumption is not true in some cases training data can be expensive or difficult to collect is this way there is a need to create high performance learners trained with more easily obtained data from different domains this methodology is referred to as transfer learning weiss et al 2016 considering these limitations the transfer learning technique is indicated to decrease the costs involved in the training it takes the advantage of the knowledge acquired from other databases training of related domains this is justified by the fact that a model learns several characteristics of a database that can be applied for other purposes that is the basic knowledge already exists it is only necessary to refine it alemi et al 2016 transfer learning technique requires a large amount of data for training in addition to that already used therefore it becomes possible to reduce the training time because the network has already been previously trained yosinski et al 2014 a limitation stems from drawbacks in the algorithm or model architecture as it is necessary to maintain the same network topology of the model previously adopted to use the knowledge acquired from previous training oliveira and romero 2018 in normal scenarios the requirement of transfer learning occurs when there is a limited supply of target training data this is possible to happen because the data can be rare the data being expensive to collect and label or the data being inaccessible with big data repositories becoming more prevalent using existing datasets that are related to but not exactly the same as a target domain of interest makes transfer learning solutions an attractive approach there are many machine learning applications that transfer learning has been successfully applied to including text sentiment classification wang and mahadevan 2011 image classification duan et al 2012 kulis et al 2011 zhu et al 2011 human activity classification harel and mannor 2011 software defect classification nam and kim 2015 and multi language text classification zhou et al 2014 prettenhofer and stein 2010 zhu et al 2011 the techniques of data mining and machine learning has been widely and successfully used in many applications where patterns from past information training data can be extracted in order to predict future outcomes witten et al 2011 in a scenario where transfer learning is applied and considering an example where two people want to learn to play the piano one person has no previous experience playing music and the other has extensive musical knowledge playing the guitar a person with extensive musical background will be able to learn piano more efficiently than someone else transferring previously learned musical knowledge to the task of learning to play the piano pan and yang 2010 a person is able to take information from a previously learned task and use it in a beneficial way to learn a related task making the learning process easier faster and more efficient in august 2016 inception resnet

for training was also made available alemi et al 2016 imagenet russakovsky et al 2015 refers to an ongoing project that aims to provide researchers access to large databases of images currently the project has 10 million images representing over 10 000 categories of objects the dataset used to pre train the mentioned model has 1 2 million images with 1000 categories and 150 000 images reserved for testing and validation among these categories there are not only plants and fruits but also various objects such as animals food and even clothes alemi et al 2016 using the transfer learning technique oliveira and romero 2018 used the inception resnet v2 model to identify cocoa fruits at the time of harvest the authors observed that after training the network was able to identify the ripe fruits with 89 accuracy recently several authors pôças et al 2017 romero et al 2018 poblete et al 2020 kumar et al 2020 used information from multispectral and hyperspectral sensors combined with neural network techniques to perform efficient monitoring of water stress in crops of agronomic interest however these technologies are difficult to access of high cost and complexity hindering accessibility and usability by the end user in this case the farmer producer these technologies are possible to be used only by scientific communities in a restricted way the present work stands out for the innovation regarding the hybrid use of the deep machine learning approach using the inception resnet v2 network specific for the determination of water stress in a culture of agronomic interest in this case sugarcane it uses a thermal image coming from a low cost camera of easy access in a quickly and nondestructively way allowing strategic decision making in order to avoid productivity losses and water waste rapid and non destructive monitoring of crop water stress is necessary to support precision irrigation management usually the existing method available for agronomic proposes to determine the water needs of a culture are rudimentary slow and manual even more they are highly complex and require specialized and trained professionals to operate specific laboratory instruments gutiérrez et al 2018 at this paper we present a developed method that does uses two current technologies in a hybrid way thermal images that is easy to access and machine learning to offer an alternative of the traditional methods to monitor the water needs of a culture the proposed method allows fast and non destructive monitoring of crop water stress in order to support precision irrigation management inspired by deep machine learning a convolutional neural network cnn is applied to thermal images for recognition and classification of the water status of sugarcane culture it was developed for the prediction of water status using thermal images and inception resnet v2 network differing from existing implementation by the use of transfer learning and low cost camera the method is applied to thermal images captured from a simple hardware since it does resize the image to the network requirement the prediction of the water status of a plant at the presented image is classified in one of the 3 classes used at the model training favorable adequate and unfavorable the database was composed of 4050 images collected during 120 days 2 materials and

thick was placed at the bottom of the boxes and covered by a geotextile blanket ntc brazil a pvc pipe 25 mm in diameter was installed drilled coated on the bottom by the same geotextile blanket and buried vertically in the soil serving as an access pipe for draining the vessels while maintaining a protected environment in the event of excessive water applications uniformity irrigation tests were carried out including all drippers in the experiment using christiansen s coefficient of uniformity and uniformity of 97 4 was obtained the treatment used in the experiment consisted of three irrigation levels corresponding to 25 50 and 100 of soil available water capacity awc fig 2 each irrigation row was composed of eight repetitions for a total of 24 plots repetitions comprised of five plants each the control of the irrigation levels was based on soil parameters table 1 and monitoring was performed using six sets of three tensiometers arranged at depths of 0 15 0 25 and 0 35 m tensiometers readings were recorded daily together with the replacement of water aiming at uniformity among treatments the replacement of the water at the parcels was done daily the soil used to fill the boxes was classified as red yellow latosol sandy phase to determine the physical hydric parameters of the soil water retention curve van genuchten 1980 by the camera richards method table 1 undisturbed samples of three layers were collected 0 0 20 0 20 0 40 and 0 40 0 60 m and analyzed in the esalq usp soil laboratory the soil water retention curve is a physical attribute that expressed as the relationship between matric potential kpa and soil water content the parameters obtained from the soil water retention curve were used in irrigation management tensiometer readings were transformed into soil water potential ψ m eq 1 and moisture values estimated based on van genuchten 1980 equation eq 2 based on the estimate of the soil moisture corresponding to the current tension the water replacement values are calculated to refill the soil profile at field capacity level for the reference plots 100 awc subsequently enabling to quantify fractions of this reference for the remaining irrigation levels of this study 50 and 25 awc the soil matrix potential ψ m is 1 ψ m l t h c where lt is the tensiometer reading kpa and h c is the water column height in tensiometer tubes

matrix potential in kpa for each treatment the irrigation levels il were designed to restore soil moisture to the field capacity θfc determined for each soil layer and the total water reposition was calculated as the result of the sum of the required level in each individual soil layer according to eq 3 the irrigation level il required to increase the soil moisture to field capacity mm is given

parcel receiving the treatment was fixed during all the experiment and the water status associated with the collected image was grounded on the treatment been applied 2 2 database for training for the database creation the experiment was conducted over 120 days starting on 11 august 2019 during the initial 30 days of the experiment all plots were irrigated with water reposition to maintain a level of 100 awc in the soil to standardize the plot conditions and leaf mass growth immediately after the 30 days partial water replenishment began 50 and 25 using the predefined irrigation levels on the fifth day when the plots were stabilized at the desired water levels the acquisition of thermal images began they were captured taken five images from different positions angle and distance in each plot at arbitrary times of the day the variation of the time and position to collect was intended to provide as much as variance in the images with the propose better training the network simulating field condition along with the images labeling was performed based on the water regime applied in the experimental plot of origin examples of images comprising the database are presented in fig 3 at the end of the experiment the database created for the training was composed of 4050 images with 1350 from each of the applied irrigation levels the images were captured at different times of the day between 9 am and 3 pm using a flir camera fitted to a cellphone flir one pro lt for usb flir usa the choice of this camera was based on its low cost and the fact that the images were stored on a device capable of executing the model for future predictions providing a tool accessible to small and medium sized producers this camera has a dynamic scene range between 20 c and 120 c thermal sensitivity of 100 mk image and video saved at a thermal resolution of 80 60 the accuracy of 3 c or 5 c and a video frame rate of 8 7 hz an iron pallet color with a fixed range was applied to the images and matt emissivity was used 2 3 neural network training to evaluate the transfer learning technique in the problem analyzed in this study a deep learning neural network was selected for this purpose a convolutional neural network cnn named by inception resnet v2 network was chosen due to its good performance in classifying objects present in an image unlike other cnns the inception resnet v2 network uses several convolution filters in an image instead of choosing a suitable filter for the type of data analyzed alemi et al 2016 three filters 5 5 3 3 and 1 1 are applied to the image and all results are concatenated thereby allowing the model to extract general 5 5 filter and local 1 1 filter features other characteristics of this network are the residual connections that reduces the chances of information loss and performance reduction however it is dependent on adequate optimization of model parameters alemi et al 2016 this occurs because each of the layers acts as an identity map propagating only the resources previously learned or refining them that is the input of a layer is added to its result inception resnet v2 is a deep learning network consisting of 185 convolutional blocks divided into 50 layers and contains only one fully connected block oliveira and romero 2018 initially the parameter values obtained at its last training by using the imagenet database were configured using hardware equipped with a geforce rtx 2080 ti gpu card with 11 g of ddr6 memory 4352 cuda cores and a frequency of 1350 mhz the free software tensorflow and its sub libraries used by its abstraction models neural network architecture and packages for the transformation of the databases were used to build train optimize and evaluate the model python was the programming language adopted for network training the implemented algorithm to perform the training was split into three stages preparation of dataset training the model using initial parameter values using transfer learning and evaluating the trained model the implementation stages are showed in fig 4 in the first stage thermal images were resized to resolutions of 320 240 pixels with three color channels rgb and vectorized then the image dataset collected during the experiment was split into two and converted to tfrecord format with 70 and 30 of images used for training and model testing validation respectively in the second stage the inception resnet v2 model was imported and loaded with model weights from it last training weights presented in alemi et al 2016 this included the weights of all 50 dense layers and 185 convolutional blocks as the original model was trained to classify 1000 classes the weights of the upper dense layer were discarded and the number of neurons was adapted to accommodate the three classes in this study which were 25 50 and 100 of awc the images of the training set were presented to the network in batches of 10 images for 1000 epochs the softmax function with cross entropy was used as a cost function this uses the upper layer tensor as an input parameter applies the softmax function and then calculates the cross entropy kingma and adam 2014 adam s optimization was also used an algorithm to update the learning rate during cnn training this is a suitable augmentation for the vast majority of cnns and is an algorithm available in the tensorflow library kingma and adam 2014 the exponential decay learning rate schedule was also applied with the highest possible value at the beginning of training being 0 0001 in the third stage the trained model was used to predict the water stress classes of the images in the validation set this final stage aimed to assess the accuracy of the model when it was applied to images not used during the model training phase 2 4 human evaluation to compare the classifications performed by the model after training using initial parameter values assigned using the transfer learning technique an evaluation of the set of 1008 images used for validation of the inception resnet v2 model was carried out by an human calculating the water stress index of the crop cwsi and labeling each image as belonging to 25 50 or 100 awc class plant temperature is one of the most used physiological indicators by the scientific community to provide information on the state of water in the plant gonzalez teruel et al 2019 torres sanchez et al 2020 the stomatal aperture which is directly influenced by the state of water in the plant and in the soil affects the temperature of the leaves as it acts as a cooling mechanism by controlling the evapotranspiration the higher the crop water stress the lower the stomatal aperture in order to prevent the plant from water exhaustion thus leading to an increase of leaf temperature the crop water stress index idso et al 1981 is extensively used to account for the crop stress camino et al 2018 garcía tejero et al 2018 krishna et al 2019 noguera et al 2020 giménez gallego et al 2021 by comparing the differences of temperature between the air and canopy fully transpiring leaf and non transpiring leaf image analysis was performed using the flir tools software made available by the manufacturer of the thermal camera used to capture the images used in this study fig 3 the use of the software was necessary to tabulate the temperature values of the areas of interest according to the methodology proposed by idso et al 1981 and jackson et al 1981 for calculating the cwsi eq5 tdry and twet represent respectively the maximum and minimum temperatures a non transpiring leaf tdry or a fully transpiring leaf twet can reach in those specific climatic conditions wind speed solar radiation relative humidity and air temperature as introduced by jones 2009 and the average temperature of the area o interesting was used to calculate the temperature of the canopy jones et al 2009 grant at al 2007 from the temperature data obtained from each image the water stress index of the crop cwsi was calculated by 5 cwsi t c t wet t dry t wet 5 where t wet is the leaf temperature without water stress t dry is the leaf temperature under water stress and t c is the temperature of the leaf representing the canopy since the deep learning neural network is used for image classification a method was sought to transform the cwsi values calculated in each one of the images into classes that represent water status based on the awc of the soil and plant development thus the lowest value 0 obtained from eq 5 was attributed to the best water condition for the plant the maximum expected value is 1 representing the worst condition the interval of cwsi water stress composed by the range between 0 1 was divided accordingly to assign labels to each interval according to camargo and hubbard 1999 proposed by ciiagro 2020 and it is shown in table 3 as three irrigation levels were adopted during the experiment a correlation was obtained for each with the classes presented in table 4 2 5 comparative results as the deep learning neural network is used for classification tasks classic statistical methods for analyzing the performance of models such as the r2 agreement index and the rmse are not applicable for comparing the performance a classification between the manual method and the use of the inception resnet v2 model other statistical methods were used to evaluate the performance of inception resnet v2 model these were applied to the network after training by using the starting parameter values obtained from transfer learning as well as the classification carried out by a human bean metrics that are best adequate for the evaluation of classifying predictions are recall precision and accuracy obtained from confusion matrix and graphical analyses using the receiver operating characteristics roc and area under the curve auc giraldo gonzález et al 2020 the confusion matrix presents the classification frequencies for each class of the model a way of representing the quality obtained from a digital image classification congalton 1991 it is a square matrix that expresses the relationship between the number of sample units assigned to a particular category of two classifications in this matrix the lines represent the reference data real value and the columns represent the prediction obtained with the classification method in a confusion matrix the frequency observed on the diagonal nii represents the elements classified correctly the marginal column n i represents the total number of elements classified for category i table 5 labels are the known classifications predicted are the evaluations of models false and true are the classes being analyzed according to congalton 1991 if the matrix is poorly constructed the evaluation of the model will be incorrect therefore the following factors must be considered for the construction of a matrix pattern unit and the number of samples these factors provide essential information for the evaluation of the confusion matrix from the confusion matrix it is possible to generate performance indicators for the model evaluated such as accuracy recall and precision accuracy indicates how many classifications the model predicted correctly this is the ratio between the sum of the correct predictions true positives with true negatives over the sum of the predictions eq 6 6 acuracy tp tn tp tn tn fp correct predictions total predictions two other indicators that assist in the evaluation of the model refer to precision and recall according to savoy 1997 precision eq 7 refers to the proportion of identifications that are correct and recall eq 8 refers to the proportion of real positives identified correctly 7 precision tp tp fp 8 recall tp tp fn from the precision and recall values it is possible to calculate the f score measure eq 9 which is a harmonic mean that represents the balance between the model s precision and sensitivity savoy 1997 9 f score 2 precision recall precision recall roc analysis is a graphical method for assessing organizing and selecting predictive and or diagnostic systems it was originally used in signal detection to evaluate the quality of the transmission of a signal on a noisy channel egan 1975 it has also been used in climatological analysis to assess the quality of rare event predictions mylne 2002 and for economic analyses of incomes gastwirth 1971 the roc curve fig 5 was obtained from the plot for a given class of the number of correct classifications recall on the abscissa axis and on the ordinate axis the number of false positives nfp eq 10 some components of fig 5 are important the origin 0 0 represents the strategy of never classifying a sample as positive models corresponding to this point do not produce any erroneous classification but neither are they are capable of predicting a correct classification a model that implements the opposite strategy of always classifying a sample as being from one class is represented by the point 1 1 that predicts that all examples are belonging to that class producing a high number of false classifications point 0 1 represents the perfect model in which all classes are correctly identified and point 1 0 refers to the model that always makes incorrect predictions based on these criteria models close to the lower left corner of the graph can be considered conservative because they make a classification with great certainty producing a low number of errors in the classifications models close to the top right can be considered liberal with high rates of success and errors in this manner the ascending diagonal from 0 0 to 1 1 represents a stochastic model where each point can be represented by p per where p is the class probability and per 1 p thus models belonging to the upper left triangle on this diagonal represent models that perform better than random and models belonging to the lower right triangle are worse than random jackson et al 1981 3 results and discussion 3 1 human evaluation the image classifications were known a priori due to the strictly controlled water regime throughout the experiment after evaluating the images and having them classified by a human bean the number of correct and incorrect predictions of the model were computed statistical analysis was performed for each of the existing classes in the experiment as well as for all classes the results calculated using eq 6 showed that the human was unable to identify 34 38 and 22 of the images of plants subjected to 25 50 and 100 awc respectively then it was obtained an overall accuracy of 68 fig 6 differently from the works developed by kaneda et al 2017 zhuang et al 2020 jiang et al 2019 in which they used a traditional neural network to compare the accuracy of the proposed models this work proposes the comparison and verification of the substitution of manual human analysis by a more accurate and rapidly determining technology aiming at strategic basis in precision irrigation and not only a comparison between machine learning methods as the other authors during the implementation of this task it was possible to observe the dependence on knowledge of the image locations that would represent the current state of the plant for 25 awc level this challenge stemmed from the low amount of leaf of the plant under treatment of the levels of 25 and 50 awc from the seventieth day of the experiment the higher error value for the 50 awc level can be explained by the possibility of classifying images as either 25 or 100 if the location for collecting the temperature information is not well defined demonstrating the requirement of the background of the person doing the manual evaluation and how human evaluation are more propense to errored classification the high level of accuracy for the 100 awc level can be explained by the high leaf mass developed by the plants under this irrigation regime facilitating image analysis throughout the cycle overall 32 of the images were assessed as being incorrectly labeled a similar result can be observed at jiménez bello et al 2011 in which developed an automated system for detection of water status at citrus its conception was composed of 44 thermal images canopy temperatures as the hydric potential of the plants for each image were evaluated manually as well using the linear regression reg available at sas software the results presented show better performance for the automated method presenting a r2 0 81 while the manual process was able to archive r2 0 78 collaborating with the results found at this paper the canopy temperature was also used by casary et al 2019 to investigate the detection of water stress at sugarcane in greenhouse condition demonstrating that canopy temperature ct is recognized as a useful tool for water stress detection thermography could be an alternative way yet few reports are available on its use in sugarcane also the ct readings and the thermal images acquired from the thermal camera were considered useful for water stress detection in sugarcane under the greenhouse condition and that irrigation should be performed petrie et al 2019 carried out a study to assess the water status in irrigated grape cultivars under different water regimes using the low cost thermal camera coupled to a smartphone the minitab 18 software was used to analyze the image data through regression analysis to estimate the temperature of the copy and the sheets for calculating the cwsi index and the stomatal conductance index the authors concluded that the best prediction performance found was for the cwsi index as it does not require meteorological data entry the evaluation is made just analyzing the image no extra information the r2 correlation index was 0 61 between the stomatal conductance index and the water potential of the measured stem and 0 74 for the cwsi the authors also concluded that the use of low cost thermals coupled to smartphones has the potential to be an easy and accessible tool for assessing the water status in the plant and for making better irrigation decisions 3 2 trained model evaluation three metrics were used to evaluate the model the first being the accuracy rate achieved by the network during its training the second being the accuracy rate of the network when evaluating the 30 of the images that were not presented to the network during the training and the third was the change in training accuracy to evaluate the usage of transfer learning according to fig 7 the network begins with an accuracy of approximately 40 and the accuracies increase gradually which indicates that the initial parameter values obtained using the described method are suitable for model training for the intended purpose classifying thermal images as the training progressed and the parameter values were adjusted there was an increase in accuracy reaching a value of 91 after 150 000 epochs similar results are demonstrated by oliveira and romero 2018 in which it was used the transfer learning at the same network to detect cocoa pods ready to starve in this work was presented that after training of the network with samples of cocoa pods the network was able to detect 82 of the samples presented for the validation of the training regarding to the accuracy achieved by the network when applied to the group of separate images for validation an accuracy of 82 was obtained this level of accuracy is in line with the value obtained by the network during its training and demonstrates that after the new training the network was successful in recognizing the classes of interest for the domain of this study in this case status water stress for a thermal image of sugarcane plat during the validation phase the prosed method evaluate 1000 images in less than a minute while a human evaluation does take 160 h similar results for a machine learn method were obtained by kaneda et al 2017 zhuang et al 2020 jiang et al 2019 in et al 2019 in which machine learning approaches achieved favorable performance in identifying and classifying the water status in the plant with accuracy from 83 11 to 98 84 blaya ros et al 2020 carried out a similar study to assess the water status of young cherry trees submitted to different levels of water stress the author used thermal images obtained by a low cost device to estimate the cwsi index the water potential value of the stem was used as a sensitive indicator of water stress in the plant and was used as a comparison of the values obtained by the use of thermal images the authors found a strong relationship between the cwsi index and the water potential of the stem they concluded that the use of thermal images obtained from low cost devices provided reliable data that were used to estimate the state of the water in the plant in the cherry crop 3 3 evaluation comparison a comparison between the manual and the proposed system using deep learning network inception resnet v2 was carried out for the classification of the images in the test set which were specifically separated from the training set beforehand for this task following an industry standard of validation and training set creation recommended for evaluating model performance to determine which of the methods showed greater efficiency in the classification of the images used the comparison between both methods was performed using the mentioned metrics recall precision and accuracy and roc and auc graphs in table 6 is presented the confusion matrix for the assessments made by the specialist in table 7 is showed the confusion matrix generated for the assessment carried out by the neural network the roc and uac analyses have been widely used for the comparison between automated classification methods and humans as well as between different classifications methods chung et al 2018 apply this analysis for the proximal humerus fracture detection by groups of specialist and automated method using the neural network karimi rizvandi et al 2021 does use the analyses for a self learning bayesian network model comparison among metaheuristic algorithms the evaluation of the classification of images using the deep learning neural network after training showed 19 greater accuracy compared to classification by the specialist tables 6 and 7 in which actual is the known label for the example prediction is the evaluation of the model 25 awc 50 awc 100 awc are the irrigation levels other factors are the best precision values for the model which were higher than the manual classification by 23 17 and 14 for the awc classes of 25 50 and 14 respectively when analyzing the recall rates the deep neural network was 4 27 and 25 higher in the 25 50 and 100 awc classes respectively demonstrating its higher ability to distinguish between the classes another factor that confirms the superiority of the deep neural network is the f score table 8 which values are 14 22 and 19 higher for the 25 50 and 100 awc classes respectively showing an improved balance between recall and accuracy in a similar study zhuang et al 2020 conducted a study to monitor the water status of maize crop using a set of 656 thermal images of plants under different levels of water stress classified as well irrigated moderately irrigated and with water stress a convolutional neural network cnn was applied to the images to perform the diagnosis and classification of water stress levels the method achieved satisfactory classification performance with accuracy of 88 41 showing the superiority of the technology developed over traditional agronomic techniques for the same purpose giménez gallego using svm concluded that the deep learning model presented an accuracy rate of 86 27 while the smv was 83 11 also according to the authors the machine learning model presented better accuracy as there was an increase in the set of images analyzed while the smv proved to be more efficient regarding the reduced time to prepare the data for the roc analysis of both methods the points for each class were calculated using the one against all analysis and plotted as shown in fig 8 as defined by the roc analysis models close to the point 0 1 show greater quality in the assessments for the problem analyzed note that the proposed model trained with initial parameter values set using the transfer learning procedure obtained values closer to this point for all classes thus confirming the greater performance of the cnn compared to the manual method for a better understanding of the results obtained simulations of the roc curves were generated for each training and the auc was calculated as the classification performed has three classes and the number of curves grows exponentially with the number of classes prati et al 2008 the one against all analysis technique was adopted to evaluate the ability of both methods to distinguish between each class of interest na et al 2019 by placing a new method using dcnn and comparing with gbdt they concluded that the proposed method showed superior performance than traditional presenting accuracy in the identification and classification of water stress of 98 14 and 95 95 respectively also according to the authors the proposed approach based on deep machine learning proved to be a robust and promising method for the identification of water stress in corn crop enforcing the separability capacity of dcnn presented at the roc evaluation also using cnn jiang et al 2019 present that it presented accuracy for classification of water stress in corn plants of 98 84 although according to the authors the method has adaptability to lighting and angle transformation and can also adapt to the actual field condition larger auc values imply a better ability of the model to distinguish between the classes of interest it was observed that the auc of the cnn method for the 25 awc class fig 9 was 90 being 10 greater than the manual method both methods showed a similar ability to distinguish between classes in the 50 awc class with a difference of only 1 fig 10 being 64 for manual prediction and 65 for cnn prediction this could be attributed to the images belonging to the 50 awc class erroneously being classified as belonging to the 25 or 100 classes for the 100 awc class fig 11 the proposed model was superior to the manual method by 14 the simulations showed that it produces a larger area under the curve confirming its better ability to separate classes of interest as presented by wang et al 2010 the success of this procedure relies on the assumption that both optical ir image alignment and leaf area extraction are perfect in practice such assumptions are rarely justifiable and the computed result can often be found undesirable several authors have successfully used deep neural network approaches to predict crop water stress obtaining correlation indexes r2 between real and estimated physiological indicators of 0 65 and 0 93 king and shellie 2016 salvador gutiérrez et al 2018 romero et al 2018 deep machine learning approaches achieved favorable performance in classifying water status in plants with an accuracy of 83 11 98 84 zhuang et al 2017 an et al 2019 jiang et al 2019 giménez gallego et al 2020 zhoi et al 2021 kumar et al 2020 developed two models of deep neural networks to predict the cwsi index using air temperature relative humidity and canopy temperature data obtained in thermal images according to zhou et al 2021 the accessibility to thermal imaging and machine learning techniques offer a fast and reliable future perspective for detecting and quantifying the water stress of a crop to support irrigation planning corroborating with the results presents at this paper in the future works we propose to use a larger number of irrigation levels and cameras with higher image quality for comparison of results obtained using images from a low cost camera 4 conclusion in this work we proposed a method that uses a deep learning neural network inception resnet v2 trained with transfer learning technique and thermal images to predict water stress in sugarcane crop the method was able to classify 1000 images in less than a minute the same task performed by a human specialist took 90 h and was less accuracy showing that the methodology developed presented significant reduction in time for the predictions with high accuracy 83 the use of transfer learning technique helped in the training of the network by reducing the time and resources required and demonstrated the high accuracies as in the beginning of the training as well as in the final at the validation steps when compared to a human manual specialist the proposed method showed be superior in precision and separation capability supporting the usage cnns for determining water stress as consequence the proposed model could be used by farmers for the plant water status determination reducing the time for the diagnostic not requiring knowledge from the user and can be applied for remote prediction of plant water status in the field demonstrating that the hybrid uses of the technologies of thermal image and machine learning proved to be an advanced and efficient tool for determining the water status of sugarcane culture offering an opportunity for evaluation of water stress at sugarcane that is accessible to the end user of the technology in this case farmers in a fast non destructive and reliable way the results presented in this research indicate a promising possibility of application in the efficient management of irrigation in the near future as well that the machine learn methods perform better than traditional agronomic methods to detect water stress and quantify stress severity declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared

9328,monitoring and mapping soil salinity are valuable for irrigation management and reclamation of salt affected agricultural soils in arid and semi arid regions proximal measurements of apparent soil electrical conductivity ec a can help characterize soil salinity spatial distributions however ec a is not solely a function of salinity ec a is strongly influenced by soil salinity water content and edaphic properties such as texture and bulk density consequently monitoring and mapping salinity based on geospatial ec a measurements is challenging in fields with dynamic and spatially complex patterns of salinity and water content such as occurs under drip irrigation we conducted a numerical modeling study to evaluate protocols for using proximal ec a sensing in drip irrigated systems focusing specifically on the measurement distance from the drip line that consistently identifies areas of high salinity in the rootzone the measurement distance was evaluated as a function of six irrigation management parameters soil hydraulic conductivity irrigation discharge irrigation interval solute concentration root zone volume and leaching fraction hydrus 2d was used to run a 729 member ensemble of drip irrigation simulations of water and solute dynamics under different irrigation management scenarios two case studies were simulated for clay loam soil 1 low salinity soil irrigated with high salinity irrigation water and 2 high salinity soil irrigated with low salinity water depth averaged ec a measurements down to the 75 and 150 cm depths such as can be obtained using an electromagnetic induction emi sensor were evaluated in the simulations according to the ensemble results a reliable emi measurement distance from the drip line was about 100 cm for the case of low salinity irrigation in saline soil and adjacent to the drip line for the high salinity irrigation the ensemble ec a and ec of saturated paste extract ec e distributions were twice as sensitive to the irrigation water salinity level as compared to the other irrigation management parameters the probabilistic ensemble approach can be extended to a variety of case studies to aid soil scientists and agricultural consultants monitoring and mapping soil salinity with ec a directed soil sampling for micro irrigation systems keywords proximal sensor electromagnetic induction apparent soil electrical conductivity soil salinity mapping micro irrigation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in arid and semi arid regions the salt content of soils is a major concern due to its impact on agricultural productivity and sustainability high levels of soil salinity adversely affect crop growth and yield soil and water quality and can ultimately result in soil erosion and land degradation rhoades et al 1990 corwin and lesch 2003 as a major agricultural concern it is essential to monitor soil salinity at an early stage to effectively use soil resources and maintain soil salinity below the salt stress threshold of crops the standard quantitative measure of soil salinity is the electrical conductivity of the saturated soil water paste extract ec e corwin and yemoto 2020 however direct measurement of ec e is time consuming labor intensive subject to analytical error and costly consequently for field scale inventories and monitoring of soil salinity geophysical methods are usually employed to measure in situ bulk soil electrical conductivity or resistivity which can be used as a predictor variable to estimate ec e one popular geophysical instrument for detecting soil salinity is the electromagnetic induction emi sensor emi proximal sensors are easily mobilized and do not require direct contact with the soil which permits traversing growing crops corwin and lesch 2005a emi sensors provide measurements of depth weighted apparent bulk electrical conductivity ec a typically readings are taken with the instrument in horizontal em h and vertical em v dipole orientations providing two depth averaged measurements of ec a with differing depth weighted response functions field ec a is influenced by multiple soil factors including soil salinity clay content cation exchange capacity clay mineralogy soil pore size distribution soil water content θ and temperature as well as the depth response function of the sensor rhoades et al 1989 corwin and lesch 2005a williams and baker 1982 observed that in salt affected soils 65 of the variation in measurements could be explained by soluble salt concentration alone in non saline soils conductivity variations are primarily a function of soil moisture content texture and cation exchange capacity cec pedrera parrilla et al 2016 found that the correlation between ec a and clay content was twice as high under wet soil conditions as compared to dry the multiplicity of factors potentially affecting ec a complicates its use as a predictor variable for ec e protocols and guidelines for geophysical surveys and data analyses have been developed to aid in determining ec e corwin and lesch 2003 2005b 2013 corwin and scudiero 2020 summarized the protocols recommendations include performing geophysical surveys relatively soon after rainfall or irrigation such that homogeneity of field soil moisture is maximized and using ec a directed soil sampling to develop site specific ec e regression equations requiring a relatively small number of soils samples lesch et al 1995 corwin and lesch 2005b the early ec a directed soil sampling protocols and guidelines developed by corwin and lesch 2003 2005b were devised for natural precipitation and flood and sprinkler irrigation systems where local scale variation in soil salinity is less complex than micro irrigation systems since water infiltrating at the soil surface is relatively uniform in comparison subsequently corwin and lesch 2013 developed ec a directed soil sampling protocols for fields under drip irrigation which involved taking two separate ec a surveys one along the drip line and one between drip lines to characterize the dramatically different soil moisture and salinity regimes that existed in the drip lines and between the drip lines however as shown by corwin et al 2022 these ec a directed soil sampling protocols and guidelines were inadequate for mapping the complex local scale 3 dimensional nature of salinity resulting from well established micro irrigation systems i e drip buried drip micro sprinklers etc in use for a decade or longer when following the ec a directed soil sampling protocols of corwin and lesch 2013 to map field scale soil salinity for a field under drip irrigation a single soil core is taken at the location of a drip emitter for selected locations within the field determined from model e g response surface sample design or design based e g stratified random sampling sample designs based on the spatial variability of ec a measurements the soil sample is in the sweet spot i e the location where the salinity is leached the most and is the lowest which is not representative of the 1 2 m2 volume of measurement of the electromagnetic conductivity meter i e geonics em38 used to measure ec a the induced electromagnetic field encompasses the full salinity gradient created by the drip emitter resulting in ec a measurements i e measurement of ec a in the horizontal coil configuration em h and in the vertical coil configuration em v that are not representative of the salinity in the soil core taken directly below the drip emitter subsequently the electrical conductivity of the saturation extract ec e obtained from the soil core sample is not representative resulting in an erroneous ec a to ec e calibration corwin et al 2022 to map soil salinity accurately for fields under drip irrigation corwin et al 2022 developed a modified set of protocols for mature drip irrigation systems that accounts for the complex local scale variability in salinity around drip lines an essential part of the ec a directed soil sampling protocols for drip irrigation systems involves the determination of the location of the emi measurement and soil core location that will provide the best ec a ec e calibration around the drip line corwin et al 2022 recommended the use of transient solute transport models such as hydrus 2d to establish the location of emi measurements and soil core samples to create the best ec a ec e calibration thereby eliminating the need for labor and cost intensive soil cores and their analysis for each crop and set of soil conditions it is the object of this paper to demonstrate and evaluate the use of a transient solute transport model to determine the optimal emi measurement and soil core location from the drip line for calibrating ec a to ec e from geospatial emi measurements for a field under drip irrigation the determination of the optimal emi measurement and soil core locations to best calibrate ec a to ec e for various crops and soil conditions is a crucial tool to map and monitor the complex local and field scale variation in soil salinity for drip irrigation systems using ec a directed soil sampling corwin et al 2022 2 methods we use hydrus 2d simulations to investigate optimal positioning for emi measurements and ground truth soil cores the goal is to obtain field measurements that identify high ec areas and reduce the uncertainty in field observations an ensemble of 729 simulations is used to account for uncertainty in the input parameters and boundary conditions the workflow for the ensemble simulation is outlined in fig 1 and detailed below as a demonstration we consider two case studies for drip irrigated orchards also explained below 2 1 numerical modeling drip irrigation simulations were done using the hydrus 2d software hydrus 2d uses a galerkin finite element method based on the mass conservative formulation proposed by celia et al 1990 flow individual emitters can be considered axisymmetric until the wetting patterns from neighboring emitters begin overlapping after that the axisymmetric representation can only be an approximation of the fully three dimensional problem kandelous et al 2011 although drip irrigation typically consists of many emitters with overlapping wetted soil volumes in our simulations we considered axisymmetric flow from a single emitter assuming negligible overlap the richards equation governing axisymmetric water flow in homogeneous and isotropic soil is 1 θ h t 1 r r r k h h r z k h h z k h s h where θ is the volumetric soil water

standard equations bear 2013 longitudinal and transverse dispersivities were set to 0 5 and 0 1 cm respectively equation 4 neglects chemical reactions and interactions with the solid phase we assume relatively low solute concentrations such that the electrical conductivity of a solution is proportional to its total solute concentration the proportionality permits directly replacing units of concentration in eq 4 with units of electrical conductivity ds m 1 the solute is taken up passively by roots until a threshold concentration c s max is reached šimunek and hopmans 2009 we set the threshold to 1 ds m 1 the feddes root water uptake stress parameters feddes and zaradny 1978 were based on values given for orange trees grieve et al 2012 in the hydrus 2d software since no data is available for pistachio trees in the literature except in very coarse textured soils water from surface drip emitters often travels a short distance overland before infiltrating thus rather than a point source the surface emitter was represented as a 10 cm radius source fig 2 the domain size was 300 300 cm with free drainage at the bottom boundary fig 2 2 2 apparent bulk soil electrical conductivity three main pathways exist for electrical conduction in soils via soil water occupying the larger pores via cations on exchange surfaces and via solid particles in direct and continuous contact with one another rhoades et al 1999 in sufficiently moist soils the dominant pathway is via the soil pore solution rhoades et al 1989 formulated a model for the apparent bulk soil electrical conductivity ec a that integrates the conductivities of the three pathways 5 e c a θ s s θ w s 2 e c w s e c s s θ s s e c w s θ w s e c s θ w θ w s e c w c where θ ws and θ wc are the volumetric soil water contents in the soil water and continuous liquid pathways cm3 cm 3 respectively θ ss and θ sc are the volumetric contents of the surface conductance and solid phases cm3 cm 3 respectively ec ws and ec wc are the conductivities of the soil water pathway and continuous liquid pathway ds m 1 respectively and ec ss and ec sc are the conductivities of the surface conductance and solid phases ds m 1 respectively with knowledge of soil bulk density and assuming uniform clay and organic matter contents and the soil not being extremely dry corwin and lesch 2005a it is possible to express the constituent conductivities as functions of soil properties and degree of water saturation and thus relate ec a to θ and the pore water ec ec p we assume θ θ ws θ wc total volumetric water content cm3

the surface of the axisymmetric domain a distance r from the emitter measurements taken in the vertical em v and horizontal em h configurations average the simulated bulk soil ec directly beneath the sensor down to the 75 and 150 cm depths respectively note that concerning the axisymmetric domain moving the sensor along a path parallel to the drip line and moving the sensor on a path perpendicular to an emitter are comparable in terms of increasing the distance r from the emitter fig 5a 2 3 case studies and model ensemble two case studies were developed featuring either a high or low initial soil salinity soil parameters and surface boundary conditions were based on conditions found in flores commercial pistachio orchards near lemoore ca 36 192 n 129 881 w a highly productive agricultural area in the central valley of california that is home to a variety of tree crops soils in the region often have high salinity due to combinations of some or all of the following irrigation poor drainage high water tables high levels of evapotranspiration and high levels of naturally occurring salts the soil was taken to be homogeneous with characteristics based on the soil found in the flores pistachio orchard from the soilgrids database hengl et al 2017 representative soil properties for the clay loam soil were determined to be 36 sand 37 silt 27 clay and bulk density equal to 1 59

evapotranspiration was calculated based on the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 using hourly meteorological data from cimis california irrigation management information system station no 80 the crop coefficient k c for april and may were 0 25 and 0 75 respectively based on goldhamer 2005 the 60 day simulation was found to be sufficient for wetting of the entire root zone the simulations

theoretical perfect forecast from one irrigation to the next and the evaporation fraction was assumed to be 0 15 based on similar evaporation transpiration partitioning in drip irrigated tree crops kool et al 2014 one case study featured an initial low pore water ec ec p init 1 ds m 1 irrigated with higher ec w and the other a high ec p init 12 ds m 1 and lower ec w irrigation water to account for uncertainty or variability in system parameters simulation runs were made using combinations of three possible values for six selected model parameters giving a total of 36 729 combinations and simulations for each case table 1 the model parameters were selected based on their high impact on solute distribution in drip irrigation mmolawa and or 2000 the selected parameter values for initial pore water ec ec p init irrigation water ec ec w emitter discharge q leaching fraction lf and irrigation interval i inter are within the range of common drip irrigation practices that are also applied in pistachio orchard irrigation in our study area dasberg and or 1999 burt and isbell 2005 mehdi tounsi et al 2017 pistachio root zone radius r root range was based on the pistachio effective root zone depth that is often considered in the study area baram et al 2016 burt et al 2003 and soil saturated hydraulic conductivity k s range was 20 of the calculated value maintaining it in a range typical of a clay loam soil ec a and ec e are presented as normalized values noted as e c a and e c e respectively the normalization is calculated by dividing each value of the grid element by the sum in the domain and weighted by the element size the normalization is done to facilitate comparisons between ensemble members differing in water content and applied solute to estimate the relative importance of each variable in table 1 a simple sensitivity analysis was performed for each parameter the coefficient of variation cv of the final simulated normalized apparent bulk soil ec e c a was calculated for the subset of model runs made while setting that the parameter to its middle value table 1 among the calculated cvs a relatively low value obtained for a given parameter would indicate the parameter when not held fixed had a relatively high impact on the model output variance 2 4 ensemble analysis of interest is the correlation between water content and soil salinity to the apparent ec ec a if ec e is not correlated to ec a it will be difficult to reliably infer salinity levels from measured ec a values the ec e ec a and θ ec a correlations were calculated for 5 cm horizontal radius increments down to 75 cm emi v measurement configuration and to 150 cm emi h configuration a rolling window pearson correlation coefficient ρ was calculated between the vertical means of ec e and ec a as well as between θ and ec a ec e was taken to be the soil water ec at saturation to clarify that correlations do not change significantly with time during and between irrigations the rolling correlation was calculated for all ensemble members of both cases and the ensemble mean was compared between the last 16 output times of the last 72 h of simulation using an index of agreement willmott 1981 as a standardized measure of model prediction error varies between 0 and 1 the ec a and ec e values were also calculated based on the mean value obtained when emi measurements traversed parallel to the dripline at a distance d thus averaging a soil area of changing horizontal radii from the emitter fig 5 this calculation provides the theoretical ec a values measured in the modeled field and compared to the simulated ec e values 2 5 field data qualitative comparisons between simulations and field data were made two subsections within the flores pistachio orchard in lemoore ca designated d01 and d05 were selected to provide relevant soil data subsection d01 was 230 200 m and d05 was 200 200 m soil sample sites were selected using the ec a directed soil sampling protocols summarized by corwin and scudiero 2020 to provide a range of variation in soil properties the details of the ec a survey and soil sampling can be found in the associated paper by corwin et al 2022 a brief overview of the ec a survey and soil sampling will be provided for orientation geospatial surveys of ec a for d01 and d05 were conducted using a mobile cart pulled by hand with electromagnetic induction emi and coupled gps equipment secured to the cart ten equally spaced traverses 20 m apart were taken with the electromagnetic conductivity meter within each of the flores d01 and d05 sites along each traverse ec a measurements were taken every 3 5 m measurements of ec a were taken in the horizontal em h and vertical em v dipole modes to provide shallow 0 0 75 m and deep 0 1 5 m measurements of ec a respectively using the ec a survey data 6 sampling locations were selected at each site i e flores d01 and flores d05 to represent the frequency distribution of the bivariate emi survey data for each site and to be allocated across each site to avoid spatial clustering soil cores were taken at 6 locations within both d01 and d05 at each of the 12 locations 6 locations for d01 and 6 locations for d05 soil cores were taken at 0 0 3 0 6 0 9 1 2 and 1 5 m perpendicular to the drip line at 0 3 m depth increments down to 1 5 m the cores taken at 0 0 3 0 6 0 9 1 2 and 1 5 m perpendicular to the drip line were used to characterize the salinity gradients created by drip irrigation all soil cores were kept in refrigerated storage before air drying and sieving 2 mm sieve which occurred within a few days after their collection soil samples were analyzed for electrical conductivity of the saturated paste extract ec e saturation percentage sp sodium adsorption ratio sar gravimetric water content at field capacity θ g and ph of the saturated paste extract following the chemical analysis procedures presented by rhoades 1996 sar was estimated after determining ca mg and na concentrations in the saturated paste extract the field ec e and θ measured values are qualitatively compared to the model results 3 results and discussion 3 1 simulation results and field data example results for one of the simulated soil profiles obtained at the end of the 60 day simulation are shown in fig 6 the patterns and trends shown were roughly the same for all 729 realizations the water content presented as saturation degree normalized to field capacity s e s e fc has the same pattern for both case studies left panels in figs 6a and 6b there is some difference in s e between cases at the edge of the wetted bulb at about 150 180 cm from the dripper the wetter soil in the high ec p init case are caused by relatively less water uptake occurring in areas of the root zone with higher salinity fig 6b right panel the salinity profiles differ between cases figs 6a vs 6b right panels the low ec p init case has a higher concentration of salinity close to the dripper as most salts in the profile were added with the irrigation water and accumulated in the rootzone the high ec p init case has lower ec e close to the dripper while the salts being leached by relatively low ec water accumulate at the periphery of the wetted bulb the two case studies represent possible scenarios where present irrigation water quality differs from that used in the past at both sites sampled in the pistachio orchard ec e was positively correlated with distance from the emitter fig 7 at site d01 the ec e vs distance correlation was r2 0 32 when calculated for all transects at the site fig 7b at site do5 the correlation was r2 0 49 fig 7c the measured ec e values have a qualitative resemblance to the high ec p init case results with a general increasing ec e gradient when moving away from the emitter and with a similar range of ec e values presented in fig 6a the field data and modeled high ec p init case study represent saline soils irrigated with relatively good quality water and thus solute concentration gradients are positive moving away from the emitter 3 2 ensemble analysis 3 2 1 θ ec a correlation and ec e ec a correlations in the low ec p init case θ ec a and ec e ec a correlations for simulated em v measurements 150 cm averaging depth are positively high out to a radial distance of 100 cm from the emitter for all three presented simulation times with small variance between ensemble members fig 8a c e the em h results 75 cm averaging depth show a lower mostly positive correlation and higher variance over the same radial distance for the high ec p init case θ ec a and ec e ec a correlations are lower sometimes negative over the 0 100 cm distance as compared to the low ec p init case in most of the wetted area radial distance 0 120 cm the θ ec a correlation for the high ec p init case is negative for em v and is low with large ensemble variability for em h fig 8d f this is caused by the general positive ec e gradient and a negative θ gradient with distance from the emitter fig 6b for both measurement depths at the end of the simulations there is an area of high positive θ ec a and ec e ec a correlation at 80 150 cm distance in the low ec p init case fig 8c e and at 130 180 cm in the high ec p init case fig 8d f this range of distances away from the dripper can be considered a reliable distance for ec a measurements since ec e ec a are highly correlated with a small variability between ensemble members fig 8b c d e the ec e ec a correlation was generally greater more positive and more reliable smaller variance for the 150 cm measurement depth than for the 75 cm depth the index of agreement of mean correlations of θ ec a and ec e ec a in the last 72 h of simulations 16 in total was higher than 0 96 by average for all cases and depths the high agreement indicates the correlations presented in fig 8 do not change drastically in the later stages of the simulations 3 2 2 calculated ensemble ec a and sensitivity analysis to further understand θ and ec e dynamics and their potential effect on ec a measurements with an emi device it is important to consider the entire ec a soil profile the mean and cv of the calculated e c a eq 5 of the ensemble members were computed at the end of the simulations fig 9 the low ec p init case has the higher averaged e c a very close to the emitter where both moisture and solute concentrations are high fig 9a for the high ec p init case the displaced salts are concentrated towards the edges of the wet area and increase the e c a at that area despite it being drier as shown for one ensemble member in fig 6 for the high ec p init case proximal measurement far from the wetted bulb may be misleading since there is a high e c a but high salinity in those areas might not have influence on the root zone and thus the tree health and production fig 9b for both cases there is higher ensemble variability in e c a toward the edges of the wet bulb fig 9 but the low ec p init case has a low variability close to the emitter and the high ec p init case has a also high variability close to the emitter thus for the low ec p init case the higher relative concentration of soil ec a is close to the dripper with low variability making it the ideal area for measurements but for the high ec p init case the area of high e c a is also characterized by high ensemble variability implying the e c a in this area will differ depending on irrigation management fig 9 the sensitivity analysis that measured the ensemble cv of e c a when each parameter is held fixed shows the largest contribution to ensemble variance was by ec w for both case studies fig 10 the i inter parameter was the second largest contributor to ensemble uncertainty in both case studies the contribution of all other parameters was similar for this case study knowledge of irrigation water salinity level may be of high benefit in assessing optimal locations for proximal salinity sensing other case studies with different ranges of parameters may give different results since any sensitivity analysis is largely dependent on the parameter range prior knowledge of this range of possible values can help reduce uncertainty when applying this modeling framework to other case studies 3 2 3 ec a with distance from the drip line when calculating e c a and e c e along a parallel path at a distance d from the drip line average values decrease with increasing d and then remain low and close to constant after 120 cm for the low ec p init case fig 11a for the high ec p init case e c a and e c e increase with d when d 100 cm decrease with d between 100 cm d 150 cm and remain almost constant with d 150 cm fig 11b thus for observing salt accumulation in the field a measurement as close as possible to dripline will capture the largest portion of ec a and ec e for the low ec p init case and a measurement at d 100 cm will be optimal for the high ec p init case the high ec p init case for e c a down to the 75 cm depth has a large variability for small d values indicating that some of the ensemble members may have the highest e c a in that area this is also suggested by the low correlation and high variability of ec a at a 75 cm depth shown in fig 8 d f other case studies can result in different results and present a different optimal location for measurements moreover more considerations may be involved in choosing the optimal d such as the desire to measure in an active root zone area where the measured salinity is affecting the tree or the desire to measure in an area that represents mean values rather than the highest salinity values 4 conclusions electromagnetic induction emi measurements of soil electrical conductivity ec a are routinely used to map and monitor soil salinity ec e however in drip irrigated fields emi measurements are affected by the positioning of the instrument relative to drip emitters potentially limiting their utility in determining ec e in this work simulation was used to investigate optimal emi measurement practices for drip irrigated systems an ensemble modeling approach accounted for unknown or uncertain model parameters and inputs two case studies were developed one with high initial soil salinity and low salinity irrigation water and one with low initial soil salinity and high salinity irrigation water the ensemble simulations identified measurement positions where the correlation between ec a and ec e was high as needed to reliably predict ec e from ec a analyses of the case studies found that reliable salinity monitoring was possible using proximal electrical conductivity measurements taken 80 150 cm from the emitter in the low initial soil salinity case and 130 180 cm for the high initial soil salinity case for the low initial salinity case a measurement adjacent to the emitter was also reliable for detecting profile salinity down to a depth of 150 cm overall the optimal measurement position for determining ec a and ec e was found to be directly adjacent to the emitter in the low initial soil salinity case and 100 cm from the emitter in the high initial salinity case many management soil and crop parameters are unknown among parameters considered uncertain in this study irrigation water salinity and irrigation frequency had the largest effect on model ensemble variance thus irrigation water quality and irrigation frequency were key factors in predicting soil solute distributions and in assessing optimal ec a measurement locations the results obtained here are specific to the two considered case studies at present determining optimal measurement positioning for other irrigation scenarios would require applying the ensemble approach using parameters and inputs specific to each scenario to simplify that process future work aimed at identifying the most important parameters to include as part of the ensemble uncertainty analysis is needed additional parameters to consider could include the unsaturated soil hydraulic parameters through analyses of a wide range of additional scenarios it may become possible to identify general recommendations for emi based measurements which could be applied when site specific simulation analyses are not possible declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

9328,monitoring and mapping soil salinity are valuable for irrigation management and reclamation of salt affected agricultural soils in arid and semi arid regions proximal measurements of apparent soil electrical conductivity ec a can help characterize soil salinity spatial distributions however ec a is not solely a function of salinity ec a is strongly influenced by soil salinity water content and edaphic properties such as texture and bulk density consequently monitoring and mapping salinity based on geospatial ec a measurements is challenging in fields with dynamic and spatially complex patterns of salinity and water content such as occurs under drip irrigation we conducted a numerical modeling study to evaluate protocols for using proximal ec a sensing in drip irrigated systems focusing specifically on the measurement distance from the drip line that consistently identifies areas of high salinity in the rootzone the measurement distance was evaluated as a function of six irrigation management parameters soil hydraulic conductivity irrigation discharge irrigation interval solute concentration root zone volume and leaching fraction hydrus 2d was used to run a 729 member ensemble of drip irrigation simulations of water and solute dynamics under different irrigation management scenarios two case studies were simulated for clay loam soil 1 low salinity soil irrigated with high salinity irrigation water and 2 high salinity soil irrigated with low salinity water depth averaged ec a measurements down to the 75 and 150 cm depths such as can be obtained using an electromagnetic induction emi sensor were evaluated in the simulations according to the ensemble results a reliable emi measurement distance from the drip line was about 100 cm for the case of low salinity irrigation in saline soil and adjacent to the drip line for the high salinity irrigation the ensemble ec a and ec of saturated paste extract ec e distributions were twice as sensitive to the irrigation water salinity level as compared to the other irrigation management parameters the probabilistic ensemble approach can be extended to a variety of case studies to aid soil scientists and agricultural consultants monitoring and mapping soil salinity with ec a directed soil sampling for micro irrigation systems keywords proximal sensor electromagnetic induction apparent soil electrical conductivity soil salinity mapping micro irrigation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in arid and semi arid regions the salt content of soils is a major concern due to its impact on agricultural productivity and sustainability high levels of soil salinity adversely affect crop growth and yield soil and water quality and can ultimately result in soil erosion and land degradation rhoades et al 1990 corwin and lesch 2003 as a major agricultural concern it is essential to monitor soil salinity at an early stage to effectively use soil resources and maintain soil salinity below the salt stress threshold of crops the standard quantitative measure of soil salinity is the electrical conductivity of the saturated soil water paste extract ec e corwin and yemoto 2020 however direct measurement of ec e is time consuming labor intensive subject to analytical error and costly consequently for field scale inventories and monitoring of soil salinity geophysical methods are usually employed to measure in situ bulk soil electrical conductivity or resistivity which can be used as a predictor variable to estimate ec e one popular geophysical instrument for detecting soil salinity is the electromagnetic induction emi sensor emi proximal sensors are easily mobilized and do not require direct contact with the soil which permits traversing growing crops corwin and lesch 2005a emi sensors provide measurements of depth weighted apparent bulk electrical conductivity ec a typically readings are taken with the instrument in horizontal em h and vertical em v dipole orientations providing two depth averaged measurements of ec a with differing depth weighted response functions field ec a is influenced by multiple soil factors including soil salinity clay content cation exchange capacity clay mineralogy soil pore size distribution soil water content θ and temperature as well as the depth response function of the sensor rhoades et al 1989 corwin and lesch 2005a williams and baker 1982 observed that in salt affected soils 65 of the variation in measurements could be explained by soluble salt concentration alone in non saline soils conductivity variations are primarily a function of soil moisture content texture and cation exchange capacity cec pedrera parrilla et al 2016 found that the correlation between ec a and clay content was twice as high under wet soil conditions as compared to dry the multiplicity of factors potentially affecting ec a complicates its use as a predictor variable for ec e protocols and guidelines for geophysical surveys and data analyses have been developed to aid in determining ec e corwin and lesch 2003 2005b 2013 corwin and scudiero 2020 summarized the protocols recommendations include performing geophysical surveys relatively soon after rainfall or irrigation such that homogeneity of field soil moisture is maximized and using ec a directed soil sampling to develop site specific ec e regression equations requiring a relatively small number of soils samples lesch et al 1995 corwin and lesch 2005b the early ec a directed soil sampling protocols and guidelines developed by corwin and lesch 2003 2005b were devised for natural precipitation and flood and sprinkler irrigation systems where local scale variation in soil salinity is less complex than micro irrigation systems since water infiltrating at the soil surface is relatively uniform in comparison subsequently corwin and lesch 2013 developed ec a directed soil sampling protocols for fields under drip irrigation which involved taking two separate ec a surveys one along the drip line and one between drip lines to characterize the dramatically different soil moisture and salinity regimes that existed in the drip lines and between the drip lines however as shown by corwin et al 2022 these ec a directed soil sampling protocols and guidelines were inadequate for mapping the complex local scale 3 dimensional nature of salinity resulting from well established micro irrigation systems i e drip buried drip micro sprinklers etc in use for a decade or longer when following the ec a directed soil sampling protocols of corwin and lesch 2013 to map field scale soil salinity for a field under drip irrigation a single soil core is taken at the location of a drip emitter for selected locations within the field determined from model e g response surface sample design or design based e g stratified random sampling sample designs based on the spatial variability of ec a measurements the soil sample is in the sweet spot i e the location where the salinity is leached the most and is the lowest which is not representative of the 1 2 m2 volume of measurement of the electromagnetic conductivity meter i e geonics em38 used to measure ec a the induced electromagnetic field encompasses the full salinity gradient created by the drip emitter resulting in ec a measurements i e measurement of ec a in the horizontal coil configuration em h and in the vertical coil configuration em v that are not representative of the salinity in the soil core taken directly below the drip emitter subsequently the electrical conductivity of the saturation extract ec e obtained from the soil core sample is not representative resulting in an erroneous ec a to ec e calibration corwin et al 2022 to map soil salinity accurately for fields under drip irrigation corwin et al 2022 developed a modified set of protocols for mature drip irrigation systems that accounts for the complex local scale variability in salinity around drip lines an essential part of the ec a directed soil sampling protocols for drip irrigation systems involves the determination of the location of the emi measurement and soil core location that will provide the best ec a ec e calibration around the drip line corwin et al 2022 recommended the use of transient solute transport models such as hydrus 2d to establish the location of emi measurements and soil core samples to create the best ec a ec e calibration thereby eliminating the need for labor and cost intensive soil cores and their analysis for each crop and set of soil conditions it is the object of this paper to demonstrate and evaluate the use of a transient solute transport model to determine the optimal emi measurement and soil core location from the drip line for calibrating ec a to ec e from geospatial emi measurements for a field under drip irrigation the determination of the optimal emi measurement and soil core locations to best calibrate ec a to ec e for various crops and soil conditions is a crucial tool to map and monitor the complex local and field scale variation in soil salinity for drip irrigation systems using ec a directed soil sampling corwin et al 2022 2 methods we use hydrus 2d simulations to investigate optimal positioning for emi measurements and ground truth soil cores the goal is to obtain field measurements that identify high ec areas and reduce the uncertainty in field observations an ensemble of 729 simulations is used to account for uncertainty in the input parameters and boundary conditions the workflow for the ensemble simulation is outlined in fig 1 and detailed below as a demonstration we consider two case studies for drip irrigated orchards also explained below 2 1 numerical modeling drip irrigation simulations were done using the hydrus 2d software hydrus 2d uses a galerkin finite element method based on the mass conservative formulation proposed by celia et al 1990 flow individual emitters can be considered axisymmetric until the wetting patterns from neighboring emitters begin overlapping after that the axisymmetric representation can only be an approximation of the fully three dimensional problem kandelous et al 2011 although drip irrigation typically consists of many emitters with overlapping wetted soil volumes in our simulations we considered axisymmetric flow from a single emitter assuming negligible overlap the richards equation governing axisymmetric water flow in homogeneous and isotropic soil is 1 θ h t 1 r r r k h h r z k h h z k h s h where θ is the volumetric soil water

standard equations bear 2013 longitudinal and transverse dispersivities were set to 0 5 and 0 1 cm respectively equation 4 neglects chemical reactions and interactions with the solid phase we assume relatively low solute concentrations such that the electrical conductivity of a solution is proportional to its total solute concentration the proportionality permits directly replacing units of concentration in eq 4 with units of electrical conductivity ds m 1 the solute is taken up passively by roots until a threshold concentration c s max is reached šimunek and hopmans 2009 we set the threshold to 1 ds m 1 the feddes root water uptake stress parameters feddes and zaradny 1978 were based on values given for orange trees grieve et al 2012 in the hydrus 2d software since no data is available for pistachio trees in the literature except in very coarse textured soils water from surface drip emitters often travels a short distance overland before infiltrating thus rather than a point source the surface emitter was represented as a 10 cm radius source fig 2 the domain size was 300 300 cm with free drainage at the bottom boundary fig 2 2 2 apparent bulk soil electrical conductivity three main pathways exist for electrical conduction in soils via soil water occupying the larger pores via cations on exchange surfaces and via solid particles in direct and continuous contact with one another rhoades et al 1999 in sufficiently moist soils the dominant pathway is via the soil pore solution rhoades et al 1989 formulated a model for the apparent bulk soil electrical conductivity ec a that integrates the conductivities of the three pathways 5 e c a θ s s θ w s 2 e c w s e c s s θ s s e c w s θ w s e c s θ w θ w s e c w c where θ ws and θ wc are the volumetric soil water contents in the soil water and continuous liquid pathways cm3 cm 3 respectively θ ss and θ sc are the volumetric contents of the surface conductance and solid phases cm3 cm 3 respectively ec ws and ec wc are the conductivities of the soil water pathway and continuous liquid pathway ds m 1 respectively and ec ss and ec sc are the conductivities of the surface conductance and solid phases ds m 1 respectively with knowledge of soil bulk density and assuming uniform clay and organic matter contents and the soil not being extremely dry corwin and lesch 2005a it is possible to express the constituent conductivities as functions of soil properties and degree of water saturation and thus relate ec a to θ and the pore water ec ec p we assume θ θ ws θ wc total volumetric water content cm3

1 and cp is clay percentage fig 3 shows the θ ec a ec p relationship for the clay loam soil used in this study discussed below fig 4 to simulate emi measurements we suppose an emi sensor is located at the surface of the axisymmetric domain a distance r from the emitter measurements taken in the vertical em v and horizontal em h configurations average the simulated bulk soil ec directly beneath the sensor down to the 75 and 150 cm depths respectively note that concerning the axisymmetric domain moving the sensor along a path parallel to the drip line and moving the sensor on a path perpendicular to an emitter are comparable in terms of increasing the distance r from the emitter fig 5a 2 3 case studies and model ensemble two case studies were developed featuring either a high or low initial soil salinity soil parameters and surface boundary conditions were based on conditions found in flores commercial pistachio orchards near lemoore ca 36 192 n 129 881 w a highly productive agricultural area in the central valley of california that is home to a variety of tree crops soils in the region often have high salinity due to combinations of some or all of the following irrigation poor drainage high water tables high levels of evapotranspiration and high levels of naturally occurring salts the soil was taken to be homogeneous with characteristics based on the soil found in the flores pistachio orchard from the soilgrids database hengl et al 2017 representative soil properties for the clay loam soil were determined to be 36 sand 37 silt 27 clay and bulk density equal to 1 59 g cm 3 the rosetta v3 pedotransfer function zhang and schaap 2017 was used to estimate soil hydraulic parameters from the soil properties the resulting parameters were θ r 0 103 θ s 0 412 α 0 0071 cm 1 n 1 37 and k s 0 363 cm h 1 the model runs for the case studies simulated 60 days with surface boundary conditions reminiscent of early season april may pistachio irrigation crop potential evapotranspiration was calculated based on the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 using hourly meteorological data from cimis california irrigation management information system station no 80 the crop coefficient k c for april and may were 0 25 and 0 75 respectively based on goldhamer 2005 the 60 day simulation was found to be sufficient for wetting of the entire root zone the simulations ran with uniform initial θ 70 of field capacity and pore water salinity ec p init values used for case studies discussed below potential crop evapotranspiration et c and water requirements per tree assumed one tree per 48 m2 and 8 emitters per tree applied irrigation water was determined according to et c et c lf where lf is the target leaching fraction et c was calculated according to a theoretical perfect forecast from one irrigation to the next and the evaporation fraction was assumed to be 0 15 based on similar evaporation transpiration partitioning in drip irrigated tree crops kool et al 2014 one case study featured an initial low pore water ec ec p init 1 ds m 1 irrigated with higher ec w and the other a high ec p init 12 ds m 1 and lower ec w irrigation water to account for uncertainty or variability in system parameters simulation runs were made using combinations of three possible values for six selected model parameters giving a total of 36 729 combinations and simulations for each case table 1 the model parameters were selected based on their high impact on solute distribution in drip irrigation mmolawa and or 2000 the selected parameter values for initial pore water ec ec p init irrigation water ec ec w emitter discharge q leaching fraction lf and irrigation interval i inter are within the range of common drip irrigation practices that are also applied in pistachio orchard irrigation in our study area dasberg and or 1999 burt and isbell 2005 mehdi tounsi et al 2017 pistachio root zone radius r root range was based on the pistachio effective root zone depth that is often considered in the study area baram et al 2016 burt et al 2003 and soil saturated hydraulic conductivity k s range was 20 of the calculated value maintaining it in a range typical of a clay loam soil ec a and ec e are presented as normalized values noted as e c a and e c e respectively the normalization is calculated by dividing each value of the grid element by the sum in the domain and weighted by the element size the normalization is done to facilitate comparisons between ensemble members differing in water content and applied solute to estimate the relative importance of each variable in table 1 a simple sensitivity analysis was performed for each parameter the coefficient of variation cv of the final simulated normalized apparent bulk soil ec e c a was calculated for the subset of model runs made while setting that the parameter to its middle value table 1 among the calculated cvs a relatively low value obtained for a given parameter would indicate the parameter when not held fixed had a relatively high impact on the model output variance 2 4 ensemble analysis of interest is the correlation between water content and soil salinity to the apparent ec ec a if ec e is not correlated to ec a it will be difficult to reliably infer salinity levels from measured ec a values the ec e ec a and θ ec a correlations were calculated for 5 cm horizontal radius increments down to 75 cm emi v measurement configuration and to 150 cm emi h configuration a rolling window pearson correlation coefficient ρ was calculated between the vertical means of ec e and ec a as well as between θ and ec a ec e was taken to be the soil water ec at saturation to clarify that correlations do not change significantly with time during and between irrigations the rolling correlation was calculated for all ensemble members of both cases and the ensemble mean was compared between the last 16 output times of the last 72 h of simulation using an index of agreement willmott 1981 as a standardized measure of model prediction error varies between 0 and 1 the ec a and ec e values were also calculated based on the mean value obtained when emi measurements traversed parallel to the dripline at a distance d thus averaging a soil area of changing horizontal radii from the emitter fig 5 this calculation provides the theoretical ec a values measured in the modeled field and compared to the simulated ec e values 2 5 field data qualitative comparisons between simulations and field data were made two subsections within the flores pistachio orchard in lemoore ca designated d01 and d05 were selected to provide relevant soil data subsection d01 was 230 200 m and d05 was 200 200 m soil sample sites were selected using the ec a directed soil sampling protocols summarized by corwin and scudiero 2020 to provide a range of variation in soil properties the details of the ec a survey and soil sampling can be found in the associated paper by corwin et al 2022 a brief overview of the ec a survey and soil sampling will be provided for orientation geospatial surveys of ec a for d01 and d05 were conducted using a mobile cart pulled by hand with electromagnetic induction emi and coupled gps equipment secured to the cart ten equally spaced traverses 20 m apart were taken with the electromagnetic conductivity meter within each of the flores d01 and d05 sites along each traverse ec a measurements were taken every 3 5 m measurements of ec a were taken in the horizontal em h and vertical em v dipole modes to provide shallow 0 0 75 m and deep 0 1 5 m measurements of ec a respectively using the ec a survey data 6 sampling locations were selected at each site i e flores d01 and flores d05 to represent the frequency distribution of the bivariate emi survey data for each site and to be allocated across each site to avoid spatial clustering soil cores were taken at 6 locations within both d01 and d05 at each of the 12 locations 6 locations for d01 and 6 locations for d05 soil cores were taken at 0 0 3 0 6 0 9 1 2 and 1 5 m perpendicular to the drip line at 0 3 m depth increments down to 1 5 m the cores taken at 0 0 3 0 6 0 9 1 2 and 1 5 m perpendicular to the drip line were used to characterize the salinity gradients created by drip irrigation all soil cores were kept in refrigerated storage before air drying and sieving 2 mm sieve which occurred within a few days after their collection soil samples were analyzed for electrical conductivity of the saturated paste extract ec e saturation percentage sp sodium adsorption ratio sar gravimetric water content at field capacity θ g and ph of the saturated paste extract following the chemical analysis procedures presented by rhoades 1996 sar was estimated after determining ca mg and na concentrations in the saturated paste extract the field ec e and θ measured values are qualitatively compared to the model results 3 results and discussion 3 1 simulation results and field data example results for one of the simulated soil profiles obtained at the end of the 60 day simulation are shown in fig 6 the patterns and trends shown were roughly the same for all 729 realizations the water content presented as saturation degree normalized to field capacity s e s e fc has the same pattern for both case studies left panels in figs 6a and 6b there is some difference in s e between cases at the edge of the wetted bulb at about 150 180 cm from the dripper the wetter soil in the high ec p init case are caused by relatively less water uptake occurring in areas of the root zone with higher salinity fig 6b right panel the salinity profiles differ between cases figs 6a vs 6b right panels the low ec p init case has a higher concentration of salinity close to the dripper as most salts in the profile were added with the irrigation water and accumulated in the rootzone the high ec p init case has lower ec e close to the dripper while the salts being leached by relatively low ec water accumulate at the periphery of the wetted bulb the two case studies represent possible scenarios where present irrigation water quality differs from that used in the past at both sites sampled in the pistachio orchard ec e was positively correlated with distance from the emitter fig 7 at site d01 the ec e vs distance correlation was r2 0 32 when calculated for all transects at the site fig 7b at site do5 the correlation was r2 0 49 fig 7c the measured ec e values have a qualitative resemblance to the high ec p init case results with a general increasing ec e gradient when moving away from the emitter and with a similar range of ec e values presented in fig 6a the field data and modeled high ec p init case study represent saline soils irrigated with relatively good quality water and thus solute concentration gradients are positive moving away from the emitter 3 2 ensemble analysis 3 2 1 θ ec a correlation and ec e ec a correlations in the low ec p init case θ ec a and ec e ec a correlations for simulated em v measurements 150 cm averaging depth are positively high out to a radial distance of 100 cm from the emitter for all three presented simulation times with small variance between ensemble members fig 8a c e the em h results 75 cm averaging depth show a lower mostly positive correlation and higher variance over the same radial distance for the high ec p init case θ ec a and ec e ec a correlations are lower sometimes negative over the 0 100 cm distance as compared to the low ec p init case in most of the wetted area radial distance 0 120 cm the θ ec a correlation for the high ec p init case is negative for em v and is low with large ensemble variability for em h fig 8d f this is caused by the general positive ec e gradient and a negative θ gradient with distance from the emitter fig 6b for both measurement depths at the end of the simulations there is an area of high positive θ ec a and ec e ec a correlation at 80 150 cm distance in the low ec p init case fig 8c e and at 130 180 cm in the high ec p init case fig 8d f this range of distances away from the dripper can be considered a reliable distance for ec a measurements since ec e ec a are highly correlated with a small variability between ensemble members fig 8b c d e the ec e ec a correlation was generally greater more positive and more reliable smaller variance for the 150 cm measurement depth than for the 75 cm depth the index of agreement of mean correlations of θ ec a and ec e ec a in the last 72 h of simulations 16 in total was higher than 0 96 by average for all cases and depths the high agreement indicates the correlations presented in fig 8 do not change drastically in the later stages of the simulations 3 2 2 calculated ensemble ec a and sensitivity analysis to further understand θ and ec e dynamics and their potential effect on ec a measurements with an emi device it is important to consider the entire ec a soil profile the mean and cv of the calculated e c a eq 5 of the ensemble members were computed at the end of the simulations fig 9 the low ec p init case has the higher averaged e c a very close to the emitter where both moisture and solute concentrations are high fig 9a for the high ec p init case the displaced salts are concentrated towards the edges of the wet area and increase the e c a at that area despite it being drier as shown for one ensemble member in fig 6 for the high ec p init case proximal measurement far from the wetted bulb may be misleading since there is a high e c a but high salinity in those areas might not have influence on the root zone and thus the tree health and production fig 9b for both cases there is higher ensemble variability in e c a toward the edges of the wet bulb fig 9 but the low ec p init case has a low variability close to the emitter and the high ec p init case has a also high variability close to the emitter thus for the low ec p init case the higher relative concentration of soil ec a is close to the dripper with low variability making it the ideal area for measurements but for the high ec p init case the area of high e c a is also characterized by high ensemble variability implying the e c a in this area will differ depending on irrigation management fig 9 the sensitivity analysis that measured the ensemble cv of e c a when each parameter is held fixed shows the largest contribution to ensemble variance was by ec w for both case studies fig 10 the i inter parameter was the second largest contributor to ensemble uncertainty in both case studies the contribution of all other parameters was similar for this case study knowledge of irrigation water salinity level may be of high benefit in assessing optimal locations for proximal salinity sensing other case studies with different ranges of parameters may give different results since any sensitivity analysis is largely dependent on the parameter range prior knowledge of this range of possible values can help reduce uncertainty when applying this modeling framework to other case studies 3 2 3 ec a with distance from the drip line when calculating e c a and e c e along a parallel path at a distance d from the drip line average values decrease with increasing d and then remain low and close to constant after 120 cm for the low ec p init case fig 11a for the high ec p init case e c a and e c e increase with d when d 100 cm decrease with d between 100 cm d 150 cm and remain almost constant with d 150 cm fig 11b thus for observing salt accumulation in the field a measurement as close as possible to dripline will capture the largest portion of ec a and ec e for the low ec p init case and a measurement at d 100 cm will be optimal for the high ec p init case the high ec p init case for e c a down to the 75 cm depth has a large variability for small d values indicating that some of the ensemble members may have the highest e c a in that area this is also suggested by the low correlation and high variability of ec a at a 75 cm depth shown in fig 8 d f other case studies can result in different results and present a different optimal location for measurements moreover more considerations may be involved in choosing the optimal d such as the desire to measure in an active root zone area where the measured salinity is affecting the tree or the desire to measure in an area that represents mean values rather than the highest salinity values 4 conclusions electromagnetic induction emi measurements of soil electrical conductivity ec a are routinely used to map and monitor soil salinity ec e however in drip irrigated fields emi measurements are affected by the positioning of the instrument relative to drip emitters potentially limiting their utility in determining ec e in this work simulation was used to investigate optimal emi measurement practices for drip irrigated systems an ensemble modeling approach accounted for unknown or uncertain model parameters and inputs two case studies were developed one with high initial soil salinity and low salinity irrigation water and one with low initial soil salinity and high salinity irrigation water the ensemble simulations identified measurement positions where the correlation between ec a and ec e was high as needed to reliably predict ec e from ec a analyses of the case studies found that reliable salinity monitoring was possible using proximal electrical conductivity measurements taken 80 150 cm from the emitter in the low initial soil salinity case and 130 180 cm for the high initial soil salinity case for the low initial salinity case a measurement adjacent to the emitter was also reliable for detecting profile salinity down to a depth of 150 cm overall the optimal measurement position for determining ec a and ec e was found to be directly adjacent to the emitter in the low initial soil salinity case and 100 cm from the emitter in the high initial salinity case many management soil and crop parameters are unknown among parameters considered uncertain in this study irrigation water salinity and irrigation frequency had the largest effect on model ensemble variance thus irrigation water quality and irrigation frequency were key factors in predicting soil solute distributions and in assessing optimal ec a measurement locations the results obtained here are specific to the two considered case studies at present determining optimal measurement positioning for other irrigation scenarios would require applying the ensemble approach using parameters and inputs specific to each scenario to simplify that process future work aimed at identifying the most important parameters to include as part of the ensemble uncertainty analysis is needed additional parameters to consider could include the unsaturated soil hydraulic parameters through analyses of a wide range of additional scenarios it may become possible to identify general recommendations for emi based measurements which could be applied when site specific simulation analyses are not possible declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

extraction of water which poses serious threats to sustainable agricultural production and environment famiglietti 2014 therefore strategies for efficient use of irrigation water and mitigating groundwater depletion are urgently needed various water saving approaches such as critical growth stage based irrigation pressurized irrigation deficit irrigation and mulching have been tested during past decades and proved effective in increasing efficient utilization of water these measures have reduced the rate of groundwater depletion but their effects are inadequate to halt the decline in

evapotranspiration and water productivity rainfall received at the experimental plot was measured using a rain gauge soil moisture content was determined gravimetrically at 15 cm interval within 150 cm soil depth at the time of sowing and harvesting of crops crop water consumption was estimated using a water balance equation 2 p i u r d sw et where the p i u r d et and sw are rainfall amount of irrigation upward flux from deep soil into the root zone surface runoff percolation out of the root zone change in soil moisture storage between seeding and harvesting of crop and crop evapotranspiration mm respectively at experimental site the groundwater level is deep 40 m therefore u was considered negligible the surface runoff was ignored because infiltration rate was high and furthermore each plot was surrounded by 25 cm height bund the d was considered zero because water storage capacity of soil at site is high and change in moisture content of soil 150 cm was negligible therefore water balance eq 2 could thus be simplified as 3 et p i sw the water used by a crop was considered equivalent to et physical and economic water productivities in terms of irrigation water

profitability in the present study productivity and economic profitability differed among the three cluster bean based cropping systems in terms of seed and biomass yield conventional cb w system was most productive and alternative cb bp system was least productive table 2 the differential productivity of cropping systems was due to the differences in yield potential of component crops wheat had higher biomass 16 8 118 8 yields and harvest index 54 60 than indian mustard and blond psyllium suppl table 5 thus the higher productivity of cb w than cb im and cb bp systems was due to higher biomass and its greater partition of wheat crop compared to blond psyllium and indian mustard clusterbean equivalent yield is higher in cb bp than cb w cropping system due to higher selling price of blond psyllium conventional cb w had greater expenditure than that for cb im and cb bp systems table 3 because of variations in cultural and input requirement of component crops higher cost incurred in cb w than other systems was mainly due to higher use of irrigation fertilizer and seed for wheat crops compared to indian mustard and blond psyllium despite lowest seed yield the cb bp had highest net return because it can be cultivated with less input and due to its higher market price productivity and economic analysis of cropping systems is merely an economic interpretation of performance of cropping systems and such analysis is inconclusive for alternative cropping systems ray et al 2018 in the regions experiencing serious challenges of groundwater depletion 4 1 2 groundwater saving and food security in the arid rajasthan wheat is cultivated in 1 11 106 ha and produces 3 88 109 kg groundwater irrigated area accounts for 47 3 0 53 106 ha and 39 9 1 55 109 kg for production of wheat out of which 0 50 106 ha of groundwater area is over drafted and facing serious problems of groundwater depletion suppl table 6 in the cb im and cb bp systems groundwater use rates were decreased to 187 and 250 mm ha 1 per year respectively than conventional cb w cropping systems suppl table 7 thus with 50 75 and 100 of wheat area is replaced by indian mustard in the over drafted groundwater area total groundwater use will be reduced by 9 4 7 1 and 4 7 108 m3 water the respective reduction in groundwater use for converting wheat to blond psyllium will be 12 6 9 4 and 6 3 108 m3 water the corresponding wheat yield losses amounts to 37 4 28 0 and 18 7 of total production in arid rajasthan suppl table 7 it may be argued that wheat being the basis of food security in india kumar et al 2009 omitting it may affect regional food security we estimated wheat consumption of 1 69 109 kg as against production of 3 88 109 kg suppl table 8 which indicated that production of wheat is more than two times of its requirement in arid rajasthan therefore considering groundwater sustainability in arid rajasthan as top priority it appears possible to convert wheat area to indian mustard and blond psyllium in over drafted groundwater irrigated area without seriously affecting regional food security moreover the india is critically short in production of edible oil and annually imports around 15 million tons of edible oil and blond psyllium is an important export crop earning 3 106 us within this context it seems logical to divert more area of wheat crop in areas having surface water resources i e canal irrigated area in study area and enhancing yield of wheat in these areas by integrating novel genotypes and better agronomical management to ensure food security while saving underground water resources 4 1 3 resources water nutrient energy requirement and use efficiencies resource use efficiency is another criterion apart from productivity and profitability for adjudging performance of cropping system spiertz and ewert 2009 in this study alternative cropping systems saved 27 9 and 37 2 irrigation water than conventional cb w system suggesting their importance in reducing the use of groundwater a reduction in irrigation use in alternative cropping systems was may be due to lower et of indian mustard and blond psyllium than wheat table 3 conventional cb w had higher physical irrigation water productivity than alternative cb im and cb bp systems due to higher seed yield of cb w system however in terms of economic irrigation water productivity alternative cropping systems were superior to conventional cb w system largely due to better economic return of blond psyllium and indian mustard for per unit of irrigation used alternative cropping systems saved 17 4 46 1 chemical fertilizer than conventional cb w system mainly because indian mustard and blond psyllium had less nutrient 30 85 kg n ha 1 and 10 18 kg p ha 1 requirement than wheat cb bp was most efficient system and cb im was least efficient in terms of nue indicating that cb bp had more production per unit of nutrient application besides water and nutrient saving the alternative cropping systems had lower energy requirement and more energy use efficient than conventional cb w system table 5 the diminution in energy input in alternative cropping systems was mostly due to lower irrigation and fertilizer requirement of component crops indian mustard and blond psyllium in these systems because irrigation and nutrient application consumed 65 of total energy inputs additionally alternative cropping systems had higher eue indicating that they are more efficient in terms of output of energy per unit of energy input results signifying that alternative cropping systems have lower requirement of water nutrients and energy and have potential to provide higher rue than conventional cb w system and thus could be a sustainable alternative to conventional cb w system in hot arid regions 4 1 4 environmental impacts alternative cropping systems had lower gwp and ghgi than conventional cb w system reduction in gwp under alternative cropping systems was due to lower use of fertilizer seed rate and irrigation for blond psyllium and indian mustard relative to wheat wheat had 1 4 and 2 8 times greater gwp than indian mustard and blond psyllium in this study the use of crops having higher eue and lower use of fossil fuels chemical fertilizer and irrigation has been reported to significantly reduce the ghgs emissions yadav et al 2017 ghgi was highest in conventional cb w and lowest in cb bp system suggesting that for unit system productivity the amount of ghg emission was higher in conventional cb w system eco efficiency index eei which includes both ecological and economic aspects has been widely used to ascertain environmental sustainability of any production system keating et al 2010 alternative cropping systems had 1 3 2 1 times higher eeig and 1 3 1 8 times higher eeig than conventional cb w system table 5 these results suggest that alternative cropping systems are capable of providing better profit with less negative environmental impacts than conventional cb w system and hence are more environment friendly option 4 2 impacts of tillage on performances of cropping systems in the present study deep tillage dt enhanced yields economic returns resource use efficiency and eco efficiency compared to conventional tillage ct soils having low oc content in hot arid regions have a tendency of increase in soil penetration resistance as they dry gajri et al 1994 dt helps to break the penetration resistance and thus improves root proliferation gajri et al 1994 which facilitates greater access to water and nutrient present in soil chaudhary et al 1985 in the present study we also observed higher from 21 3 to 35 5 root mass density in dt than ct across different crops suppl fig 2 the enhanced root growth and consequently increased nutrient and water uptake might be responsible for higher crop yields under dt than ct yield enhancement due to dt differed among cropping systems being greatest for cb w 15 8 higher seed yield and least for cb bp 11 1 higher seed yield system relatively greater enhancement in root growth for wheat 35 5 and indian mustard 28 0 than blond psyllium 21 3 suppl fig 2 might be responsible for higher yield increase in cb w and cb im than cb bp system greater increase in gross return due to enhanced yield relative to increase in cost due to dt was responsible for higher profit associated with dt dt enhanced resource use efficiency over ct greater seed yield at same irrigation and nutrient application rates was responsible for enhanced of wp and nue under dt than ct observed in the present study the greater increase in energy output due to higher yields table 2 relative to increase in energy input table 5 under dt than ct was responsible for higher eue under dt observed in the present study dt enhanced gwp 3 6 higher due to increased use of machinery and diesel than ct but reduced ghgi 9 2 table 5 despite slightly higher energy use and gwp the dt enhanced eco efficiency than ct the greater increase in net returns compared to energy use and gwp under dt was responsible for superior eei of dt than ct the effects of tillage types on most of the measured parameters varied among cropping systems generally dt had greater enhancement in yield economic returns resource use efficiency and eei for conventional cb w system and least for cb bp system also in agreements with our results a crop specific response to tillage types has been reported by mu et al 2016 and schneider et al 2017 4 3 impacts of application of organic manure on performances of cropping systems in the present study fym application enhanced yields economic return resource use efficiency while reduced gwp and ghgi of cropping systems higher yield observed in this study under application of fym could be associated with various benefits of fym application such as improved soil properties hati et al 2006 chen et al 2018 luo et al 2018a of soils supply of nutrients that were absent in chemical fertilizers less losses of nutrients from soil and decreased fixation of applied fertilizer p iyamuremye and dick 1996 the yield enhancement due to fym application was greatest for cb w followed by cb im and cb bp cropping system results of our study confirm differential yield responsiveness of cropping systems to fym application in agreement with previous studies long et al 1995 shrikant et al 2013 this differential response is ascribed to variations in duration nutrient requirement and acquisition of nutrients from soil of component crops in this study fym application had greatest enhancement in yield of wheat 28 7 followed by indian mustard 23 1 and blond psyllium 12 3 also in agreement with our results shrikant et al 2013 found that wheat had greater yield enhancement due to manure application than indian mustard and chickpea in soybean based cropping systems our results demonstrate that fym application enhance water productivity which is ascribed to the fact that addition of organic manures improve hydraulic conductivity bhattacharyya et al 2010b water holding capacity of soils reduce soil evaporation and stimulates root functions which leads to higher wp wang et al 2020 enhancement in the efficiency of nutrients applied through chemical fertilizers when used in conjunction with organic manure is ascribed to improved soil properties hati et al 2006 which might have improved root development thereby enhancing nutrient uptake and utilization by crops bhattacharyya et al 2010b in present study fym application enhanced net energy as well as eui which is because of proportionate energy output was higher in comparison to input of energy involved from fym application the fym application reduced both gwp and ghgi and enhanced eeis reduction in gwp and ghgi due to application of fym was mainly attributed to reduction in fertilizer application optimal use of fertilizer and manure which ensuring better crop yield singh et al 2016 the greater increase in monetary returns relative to use of energy and ghg emission was responsible for enhanced eei associated with application of fym observed in this study 4 4 comprehensive evaluation of cropping systems and soil management practices higher yield and economic return are of great significance to producers while saving of irrigation water along with higher resource use efficiency and eco efficiency are essential for sustainability of agricultural production our results showed that it is difficult to obtain highest value of all parameters i e yield net economic return resource use efficiency and saving of irrigation water eco efficiency simultaneously in this study the conventional cb w with deep tillage and application of fym 10 mg ha 1 had highest yield and physical irrigation water productivity but consumed highest amount of irrigation water energy and emitted higher ghgs table 6 conversely cb bp had lowest yield and physical irrigation water productivity but consumed least irrigation water with highest economic irrigation water productivity the topsis analysis integrating all agronomic resource use economic and environmental dimensions showed that cb bp with deep tillage and addition of fym 10 mg ha 1 is suitable to achieve the multiple targets of higher economic return along with saving of inputs water chemical fertilizer and energy and enhancing environmental performances table 6 5 conclusion this study attempted to integrate analysis of outcomes of three cluster bean based cropping systems conventional cb w and alternative cb im and cb bp with different soil management practices tillage types and fym application rates for the multiple dimensions of groundwater use yield economic resource use efficiency and environmental impacts in hot arid region our study showed that groundwater use for irrigation could be reduced substantially by adopting alternative cropping systems while maintaining higher profit and minimizing global warming potential than conventional cb w system our results showed that about 0 50 106 ha of wheat grown in over drafted groundwater irrigated area of arid rajasthan if half of the this area of wheat is converted to indian mustard or blond psyllium the reduction in groundwater use will be 9 4 12 6 108 m3 the corresponding wheat yield losses were equals to 28 0 of total production in arid rajasthan between the two alternative cropping systems cb bp had advantage over cb im in terms of saving resources enhancing profitability and minimizing environmental impacts soil management practices applications of fym and deep tillage have potential to increase yield profits resource use efficiency with lower environmental impacts further topsis analysis of different alternatives of cropping systems and soil management practices indicates that cb bp with deep tillage and application of fym 10 mg ha 1 is the most favorable management package to realize maximum profit with lower environmental impact together with substantial saving of groundwater these results point the benefits of alternative cropping systems along with suitable soil management practices across productivity profitability and environmental dimensions and thus provide strong evidences for them to achieve more sustainable production system in arid region of india and promising insights for solutions in similar regions in the world facing serious groundwater over drafting credit authorship contribution statement vijay singh rathore conceptualization data curation formal analysis writing original

9329,rapid decline in groundwater table due to excessive withdrawal of water for irrigation has been posing a serious threat to sustainable agricultural production in hot arid region of india

water produces about 13 of total food production and supplies water for about 2 billion people de graaf et al 2019 groundwater use as irrigation has been effective in increasing agricultural production ensuring food and nutritional security davis et al 2017 groundwater resources have been depleting very fast in many intensively irrigated agricultural areas due to continuous unsustainable extraction of water which poses serious threats to sustainable agricultural production and environment famiglietti 2014 therefore strategies for efficient use of irrigation water and mitigating groundwater depletion are urgently needed various water saving approaches such as critical growth stage based irrigation pressurized irrigation deficit irrigation and mulching have been tested during past decades and proved effective in increasing efficient utilization of water these measures have reduced the rate of groundwater depletion but their effects are inadequate to halt the decline in groundwater level luo et al 2018b yang et al 2021 alternative crop rotations having lower water requirement have been emerged as an important strategy to reduce groundwater decline sun et al 2011 luo et al 2018b it has been demonstrated that diversification of crop rotation could decrease water consumption rathore et al 2014b and hence has potential to reduce the declining rate of groundwater table luo et al 2018b in north china alternative cropping systems in place of conventional winter wheat summer maize cropping system had 50 lower groundwater use for irrigation purpose luo et al 2018b besides productivity profitability and water saving potential of alternative cropping systems the performance of these systems in terms of non economic parameters such as resource water energy nutrient use efficiency and its negative externalities ghgs emission are equally vital for adjudging their efficiency ray et al 2018 agriculture is a major consumer of energy and source of ghgs emission rosa et al 2021 since green revolution energy uses in crop production have been increasing pellegrini and fernández 2018 although increased use of energy in agriculture plays a critical role in increasing yield ensuring timeliness of farming activities reducing human drudgery soni et al 2018 it also damages the environment due to ghgs emission associated with use of fossil fuel yadav et al 2018 and increase cost of production soni et al 2018 therefore assessment of energy consumption and ghgs emission of cropping system is essential to address the energy use and its related environmental issues yadav et al 2018 several studies have been reported environmental impacts of cropping systems in terms of energy use and ghgs emissions lal et al 2020 kumar et al 2021 it has been demonstrated that alternative cropping systems have potential to reduce energy use and carbon foot print kumar et al 2021 although previous research related to alternative cropping systems mainly focused on yield and profitability rathore et al 2014b water saving meng et al 2017 energy use and environmental impacts kumar et al 2021 yet potential benefits of alternative cropping systems and trade off among irrigation water saving economic returns resource use efficiency and environmental impacts have not yet been well documented management practices interact with cropping systems and dictate their efficiencies tillage and addition of organic manures are key component of soil management practices gajri et al 1994 mu et al 2016 tillage modifies soil environment improves root growth and uptake of water and nutrient by crops and thereby enhances yield of crops chaudhary et al 1985 gajri et al 1994 previous studies on yield of crops and ghgs emission under different tillage types have generated mixed results few in favor of tillage zhang et al 2015 lal et al 2019 and others were not bayer et al 2015 an analysis involving 1530 yield comparisons from 67 experimental sites suggest that deep tillage increased yield in 60 observations and depressed yield in 40 than conventional tillage schneider et al 2017 additionally there are trade off relationship in yield and

2016 rajasthan state accounts for 60 hot arid region of india groundwater is major source for irrigation in this region rathore et al 2010 2017 overuse of irrigation is depleting groundwater for instance in most parts of arid rajasthan the groundwater level is declining at the rate of 0 40 m yr 1 moharana et al 2016 cluster bean wheat cb w is an important cropping system of the region rainfall during wheat growing season is very less and 300 mm water for irrigation is applied for wheat rathore et al 2017 considering that water consumption of wheat is not sustainable adoption of alternative cluster bean based cropping system with lower water demands is needed indian mustard im and blond psyllium bp have lower water requirement than wheat rathore et al 2010 2014a and can be included in the cluster bean based cropping systems indian mustard is an important oil seed crop of the region blond psyllium has been cultivated for production of seed husk which is widely used in pharmaceuticals food and cosmetic industries dhar et al 2011 cultivation of this species as alternative of higher water consuming crops such as wheat and corn is advocated for arid and semi arid regions koocheki et al 2007 scientific information regarding relative effectiveness of alternative cropping systems in terms of yield profit energetic rue and environmental impact along with saving of irrigation water in hot arid region of india is not well documented to address this knowledge gap the study was conducted to test the hypothesis that alternative cropping systems cb im and cb bp in conjunction with soil management practices save irrigation water without reducing the economic profitability while minimize environmental impacts compared to conventional cb w cropping system the objectives of the study was i to compare water consumption productivity profitability energetics and environmental impacts of cluster bean based cropping systems under different tillage types and fym application rates and ii to identify suitable combinations of cropping system and soil management practices that can achieve better yield monetary return and rue simultaneously with lower environmental impacts the novelty of this study is that integrated effects of alternative cropping systems and soil management practices have been considered together to explore the options for groundwater saving and sustainable agricultural production system for hot arid environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site field experiment was conducted for consecutive three years 2015

evapotranspiration and water productivity rainfall received at the experimental plot was measured using a rain gauge soil moisture content was determined gravimetrically at 15 cm interval within 150 cm soil depth at the time of sowing and harvesting of crops crop water consumption was estimated using a water balance equation 2 p i u r d sw et where the p i u r d et and sw are rainfall amount of irrigation upward flux from deep soil into the root zone surface runoff percolation out of the root zone change in soil moisture storage between seeding and harvesting of crop and crop evapotranspiration mm respectively at experimental site the groundwater level is deep 40 m therefore u was considered negligible the surface runoff was ignored because infiltration rate was high and furthermore each plot was surrounded by 25 cm height bund the d was considered zero because water storage capacity of soil at site is high and change in moisture content of soil 150 cm was negligible therefore water balance eq 2 could thus be simplified as 3 et p i sw the water used by a crop was considered equivalent to et physical and economic water productivities in terms of irrigation water

profitability in the present study productivity and economic profitability differed among the three cluster bean based cropping systems in terms of seed and biomass yield conventional cb w system was most productive and alternative cb bp system was least productive table 2 the differential productivity of cropping systems was due to the differences in yield potential of component crops wheat had higher biomass 16 8 118 8 yields and harvest index 54 60 than indian mustard and blond psyllium suppl table 5 thus the higher productivity of cb w than cb im and cb bp systems was due to higher biomass and its greater partition of wheat crop compared to blond psyllium and indian mustard clusterbean equivalent yield is higher in cb bp than cb w cropping system due to higher selling price of blond psyllium conventional cb w had greater expenditure than that for cb im and cb bp systems table 3 because of variations in cultural and input requirement of component crops higher cost incurred in cb w than other systems was mainly due to higher use of irrigation fertilizer and seed for wheat crops compared to indian mustard and blond psyllium despite lowest seed yield the cb bp had highest net return because it can be cultivated with less input and due to its higher market price productivity and economic analysis of cropping systems is merely an economic interpretation of performance of cropping systems and such analysis is inconclusive for alternative cropping systems ray et al 2018 in the regions experiencing serious challenges of groundwater depletion 4 1 2 groundwater saving and food security in the arid rajasthan wheat is cultivated in 1 11 106 ha and produces 3 88 109 kg groundwater irrigated area accounts for 47 3 0 53 106 ha and 39 9 1 55 109 kg for production of wheat out of which 0 50 106 ha of groundwater area is over drafted and facing serious problems of groundwater depletion suppl table 6 in the cb im and cb bp systems groundwater use rates were decreased to 187 and 250 mm ha 1 per year respectively than conventional cb w cropping systems suppl table 7 thus with 50 75 and 100 of wheat area is replaced by indian mustard in the over drafted groundwater area total groundwater use will be reduced by 9 4 7 1 and 4 7 108 m3 water the respective reduction in groundwater use for converting wheat to blond psyllium will be 12 6 9 4 and 6 3 108 m3 water the corresponding wheat yield losses amounts to 37 4 28 0 and 18 7 of total production in arid rajasthan suppl table 7 it may be argued that wheat being the basis of food security in india kumar et al 2009 omitting it may affect regional food security we estimated wheat consumption of 1 69 109 kg as against production of 3 88 109 kg suppl table 8 which indicated that production of wheat is more than two times of its requirement in arid rajasthan therefore considering groundwater sustainability in arid rajasthan as top priority it appears possible to convert wheat area to indian mustard and blond psyllium in over drafted groundwater irrigated area without seriously affecting regional food security moreover the india is critically short in production of edible oil and annually imports around 15 million tons of edible oil and blond psyllium is an important export crop earning 3 106 us within this context it seems logical to divert more area of wheat crop in areas having surface water resources i e canal irrigated area in study area and enhancing yield of wheat in these areas by integrating novel genotypes and better agronomical management to ensure food security while saving underground water resources 4 1 3 resources water nutrient energy requirement and use efficiencies resource use efficiency is another criterion apart from productivity and profitability for adjudging performance of cropping system spiertz and ewert 2009 in this study alternative cropping systems saved 27 9 and 37 2 irrigation water than conventional cb w system suggesting their importance in reducing the use of groundwater a reduction in irrigation use in alternative cropping systems was may be due to lower et of indian mustard and blond psyllium than wheat table 3 conventional cb w had higher physical irrigation water productivity than alternative cb im and cb bp systems due to higher seed yield of cb w system however in terms of economic irrigation water productivity alternative cropping systems were superior to conventional cb w system largely due to better economic return of blond psyllium and indian mustard for per unit of irrigation used alternative cropping systems saved 17 4 46 1 chemical fertilizer than conventional cb w system mainly because indian mustard and blond psyllium had less nutrient 30 85 kg n ha 1 and 10 18 kg p ha 1 requirement than wheat cb bp was most efficient system and cb im was least efficient in terms of nue indicating that cb bp had more production per unit of nutrient application besides water and nutrient saving the alternative cropping systems had lower energy requirement and more energy use efficient than conventional cb w system table 5 the diminution in energy input in alternative cropping systems was mostly due to lower irrigation and fertilizer requirement of component crops indian mustard and blond psyllium in these systems because irrigation and nutrient application consumed 65 of total energy inputs additionally alternative cropping systems had higher eue indicating that they are more efficient in terms of output of energy per unit of energy input results signifying that alternative cropping systems have lower requirement of water nutrients and energy and have potential to provide higher rue than conventional cb w system and thus could be a sustainable alternative to conventional cb w system in hot arid regions 4 1 4 environmental impacts alternative cropping systems had lower gwp and ghgi than conventional cb w system reduction in gwp under alternative cropping systems was due to lower use of fertilizer seed rate and irrigation for blond psyllium and indian mustard relative to wheat wheat had 1 4 and 2 8 times greater gwp than indian mustard and blond psyllium in this study the use of crops having higher eue and lower use of fossil fuels chemical fertilizer and irrigation has been reported to significantly reduce the ghgs emissions yadav et al 2017 ghgi was highest in conventional cb w and lowest in cb bp system suggesting that for unit system productivity the amount of ghg emission was higher in conventional cb w system eco efficiency index eei which includes both ecological and economic aspects has been widely used to ascertain environmental sustainability of any production system keating et al 2010 alternative cropping systems had 1 3 2 1 times higher eeig and 1 3 1 8 times higher eeig than conventional cb w system table 5 these results suggest that alternative cropping systems are capable of providing better profit with less negative environmental impacts than conventional cb w system and hence are more environment friendly option 4 2 impacts of tillage on performances of cropping systems in the present study deep tillage dt enhanced yields economic returns resource use efficiency and eco efficiency compared to conventional tillage ct soils having low oc content in hot arid regions have a tendency of increase in soil penetration resistance as they dry gajri et al 1994 dt helps to break the penetration resistance and thus improves root proliferation gajri et al 1994 which facilitates greater access to water and nutrient present in soil chaudhary et al 1985 in the present study we also observed higher from 21 3 to 35 5 root mass density in dt than ct across different crops suppl fig 2 the enhanced root growth and consequently increased nutrient and water uptake might be responsible for higher crop yields under dt than ct yield enhancement due to dt differed among cropping systems being greatest for cb w 15 8 higher seed yield and least for cb bp 11 1 higher seed yield system relatively greater enhancement in root growth for wheat 35 5 and indian mustard 28 0 than blond psyllium 21 3 suppl fig 2 might be responsible for higher yield increase in cb w and cb im than cb bp system greater increase in gross return due to enhanced yield relative to increase in cost due to dt was responsible for higher profit associated with dt dt enhanced resource use efficiency over ct greater seed yield at same irrigation and nutrient application rates was responsible for enhanced of wp and nue under dt than ct observed in the present study the greater increase in energy output due to higher yields table 2 relative to increase in energy input table 5 under dt than ct was responsible for higher eue under dt observed in the present study dt enhanced gwp 3 6 higher due to increased use of machinery and diesel than ct but reduced ghgi 9 2 table 5 despite slightly higher energy use and gwp the dt enhanced eco efficiency than ct the greater increase in net returns compared to energy use and gwp under dt was responsible for superior eei of dt than ct the effects of tillage types on most of the measured parameters varied among cropping systems generally dt had greater enhancement in yield economic returns resource use efficiency and eei for conventional cb w system and least for cb bp system also in agreements with our results a crop specific response to tillage types has been reported by mu et al 2016 and schneider et al 2017 4 3 impacts of application of organic manure on performances of cropping systems in the present study fym application enhanced yields economic return resource use efficiency while reduced gwp and ghgi of cropping systems higher yield observed in this study under application of fym could be associated with various benefits of fym application such as improved soil properties hati et al 2006 chen et al 2018 luo et al 2018a of soils supply of nutrients that were absent in chemical fertilizers less losses of nutrients from soil and decreased fixation of applied fertilizer p iyamuremye and dick 1996 the yield enhancement due to fym application was greatest for cb w followed by cb im and cb bp cropping system results of our study confirm differential yield responsiveness of cropping systems to fym application in agreement with previous studies long et al 1995 shrikant et al 2013 this differential response is ascribed to variations in duration nutrient requirement and acquisition of nutrients from soil of component crops in this study fym application had greatest enhancement in yield of wheat 28 7 followed by indian mustard 23 1 and blond psyllium 12 3 also in agreement with our results shrikant et al 2013 found that wheat had greater yield enhancement due to manure application than indian mustard and chickpea in soybean based cropping systems our results demonstrate that fym application enhance water productivity which is ascribed to the fact that addition of organic manures improve hydraulic conductivity bhattacharyya et al 2010b water holding capacity of soils reduce soil evaporation and stimulates root functions which leads to higher wp wang et al 2020 enhancement in the efficiency of nutrients applied through chemical fertilizers when used in conjunction with organic manure is ascribed to improved soil properties hati et al 2006 which might have improved root development thereby enhancing nutrient uptake and utilization by crops bhattacharyya et al 2010b in present study fym application enhanced net energy as well as eui which is because of proportionate energy output was higher in comparison to input of energy involved from fym application the fym application reduced both gwp and ghgi and enhanced eeis reduction in gwp and ghgi due to application of fym was mainly attributed to reduction in fertilizer application optimal use of fertilizer and manure which ensuring better crop yield singh et al 2016 the greater increase in monetary returns relative to use of energy and ghg emission was responsible for enhanced eei associated with application of fym observed in this study 4 4 comprehensive evaluation of cropping systems and soil management practices higher yield and economic return are of great significance to producers while saving of irrigation water along with higher resource use efficiency and eco efficiency are essential for sustainability of agricultural production our results showed that it is difficult to obtain highest value of all parameters i e yield net economic return resource use efficiency and saving of irrigation water eco efficiency simultaneously in this study the conventional cb w with deep tillage and application of fym 10 mg ha 1 had highest yield and physical irrigation water productivity but consumed highest amount of irrigation water energy and emitted higher ghgs table 6 conversely cb bp had lowest yield and physical irrigation water productivity but consumed least irrigation water with highest economic irrigation water productivity the topsis analysis integrating all agronomic resource use economic and environmental dimensions showed that cb bp with deep tillage and addition of fym 10 mg ha 1 is suitable to achieve the multiple targets of higher economic return along with saving of inputs water chemical fertilizer and energy and enhancing environmental performances table 6 5 conclusion this study attempted to integrate analysis of outcomes of three cluster bean based cropping systems conventional cb w and alternative cb im and cb bp with different soil management practices tillage types and fym application rates for the multiple dimensions of groundwater use yield economic resource use efficiency and environmental impacts in hot arid region our study showed that groundwater use for irrigation could be reduced substantially by adopting alternative cropping systems while maintaining higher profit and minimizing global warming potential than conventional cb w system our results showed that about 0 50 106 ha of wheat grown in over drafted groundwater irrigated area of arid rajasthan if half of the this area of wheat is converted to indian mustard or blond psyllium the reduction in groundwater use will be 9 4 12 6 108 m3 the corresponding wheat yield losses were equals to 28 0 of total production in arid rajasthan between the two alternative cropping systems cb bp had advantage over cb im in terms of saving resources enhancing profitability and minimizing environmental impacts soil management practices applications of fym and deep tillage have potential to increase yield profits resource use efficiency with lower environmental impacts further topsis analysis of different alternatives of cropping systems and soil management practices indicates that cb bp with deep tillage and application of fym 10 mg ha 1 is the most favorable management package to realize maximum profit with lower environmental impact together with substantial saving of groundwater these results point the benefits of alternative cropping systems along with suitable soil management practices across productivity profitability and environmental dimensions and thus provide strong evidences for them to achieve more sustainable production system in arid region of india and promising insights for solutions in similar regions in the world facing serious groundwater over drafting credit authorship contribution statement vijay singh rathore conceptualization data curation formal analysis writing original
