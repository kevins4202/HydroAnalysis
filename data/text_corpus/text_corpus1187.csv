5935,we present a two step framework for calibrating complex many parameter hydrological models at basin scale the framework first calibrates parameters for each catchment sub basin sequentially and then fine tunes parameters as needed we implemented a comprehensive learning particle swarm optimiser clpso as the calibrator and applied the two step clpso tool in calibrating parameters of a water accounting model for the murray darling basin australia the visual and quantitative results indicated that our tool produced satisfactory calibration and prediction outcomes for the model s intended purpose the comparison experiments demonstrated that the calibration framework and the clpso were competent in calibrating large scale hydrological models this framework can guarantee spatial coherence balance objective trade offs among all catchments and calibrate many parameters at a low computational cost by providing better parameter estimates in complex whole of basin hydrological models our calibration tool has the potential to increase the development and application of these models and thereby improve the management of large river basins keywords model calibration parameterisation particle swarm optimisation hydrological models rivers irrigation 1 introduction hydro economic models have been increasingly used in capturing the complexity of interactions between water and economy and helping water resource managers address water scarcity and reduce water demand conflicts graveline 2016 harou et al 2009 mainuddin et al 2007 qureshi et al 2007 these hydro economic models often integrate management options and economic values into a detailed hydrological component which represents appropriate complexity and heterogeneity of a water resource system the hydrological component in some cases needs to reflect large basin scale hydrological dynamics that is affected by policy changes however most hydrological models especially conceptual rainfall runoff models are calibrated at a catchment scale capitalising on the reduced hydrologic physiographic and socio economic complexity at this scale in contrast large scale whole of basin hydrological models are characterised by expanded model structures covering heterogeneous environmental and socio economic conditions complex reach connection relationships and require a substantial number of model parameters to be estimated in the relatively few studies that have addressed hydrological model calibration across multiple sites catchments sub basins either a single parameter set is employed for all catchments e g engeland et al 2006 khakbaz et al 2012 wang et al 2012 or multiple catchments sites are treated individually from upstream to downstream e g ajami et al 2004 hughes et al 2014 however since hydrologic systems often exhibit a large degree of spatial heterogeneity in their characteristics grayson and bloeschl 2000 approaches which regard model parameters as identical for all catchments are inadequate similarly multi site calibration experiments e g andersen et al 2001 have demonstrated that the calibration performance in downstream catchments may be affected by the performance upstream this suggests that uncertainties and or compensation of errors will propagate downstream and affect the overall calibration of the model thus the calibration of individual sites ignoring hydrological connectivity while an improvement on single site approaches is also insufficient meanwhile this calibration fashion showed up low efficiency to address this some researchers have proposed a system wide approach enabling a simultaneous calibration for the systematic evaluation of the trade offs among objective functions from all catchments e g shrestha and rode 2008 but this approach raises two challenges one is that when applied at a whole of basin scale a large number of model parameters for related catchments may need calibrating simultaneously for example a hydrological model for the murray darling basin mdb requires calibrating model parameters for 58 connected catchments csiro 2008a the second challenge is the trade offs among objective functions for all catchments an objective function provides a measurement of similarity between observed and estimated outputs molina navarro et al 2017 the similarity degree calibration space data availability and uncertainty levels for catchments differ therefore a normalisation procedure is required before balancing the objective functions from all catchments however finding a suitable weighting function used in the system normalisation procedure is difficult hughes et al 2015 to overcome these challenges this paper adds new dimension to large scale hydrologic model calibration by enhancing individual catchment level sub basin level step wise parameter calibration introduced by rajib et al 2018 via a novel two step hierarchical global approach the hierarchical calibration is responsible for guaranteeing catchment level spatial coherence allowing model calibration at a whole of basin scale with low computational cost the global calibration is used for fine tuning of parameters based on model predictive needs or expert knowledge there has been a historical trend away from manual calibration methods towards more automatic procedures two calibration strategies are commonly used to automatically explore the parameter space local and global methods kavetski et al 2018 robustness capability of consistently locating the optimal parameter set and computational cost often represented by the number of objective function evaluations or cpu time required to find the optimal parameter set are two key performance indicators for evaluating these automatic calibrators kavetski et al 2018 local calibration methods such as gauss newton type methods qin et al 2018b usually converge fast but tend to get trapped in a local optimum when solving multimodal problems popular global methods to automatically calibrate hydrological models are evolutionary algorithms eas maier et al 2014 such as genetic algorithms ga seibert 2000 shuffled complex evolution sce duan et al 1992 and simulated annealing sa sumner et al 1997 a large number of studies have concluded that eas perform better than local methods in finding the global optimum e g gao et al 2006 madsen et al 2002 but tend to be computationally expensive qin et al 2018a a relatively new ea particle swarm optimisation pso was first proposed by kennedy and eberhart 1995 it is an algorithm inspired by the social behaviour of animals such as bird flocking and fish schooling pso has gained popularity lately and has been applied widely including to the automatic calibration of hydrological models jiang et al 2013 thiemig et al 2013 zambrano bigiarini and rojas 2013 compared to conventional eas generally which have strong global search ability but low convergence speed and computational efficiency zhang et al 2009 pso is attractive due to its simplicity of implementation and its ability to quickly converge to a reasonably good solution however similar to ga the standard pso may get trapped in local optima especially when solving complex multimodal problems liang et al 2006 here a comprehensive learning particle swarm optimiser clpso gao and hailu 2010 liang et al 2006 is used to improve the standard pso s performance on complex multimodal problems aiming to outperform conventional eas in both robustness and computational cost in this study we present a transparent and automated hierarchical global clpso calibration tool for basin scale hydrological model calibration we applied our calibration tool to a water accounting model for the mdb australia s largest river system kirby et al 2013 the model was designed for and has been used to supply scenario information for a range of economic analyses e g kirby et al 2014 kirby et al 2015 the hydrological model discussed in this paper provides monthly estimates of runoff river flow diversions and losses for the mdb compared with daily water accounting models monthly models have the advantage of needing only monthly data and have lower computational cost wang et al 2011 so that iterative solutions ea based calibration for example could be obtained we evaluate the performance of the calibration tool and discuss its utility for broad application to whole of basin models of large complex river systems 2 methods 2 1 two step automatic calibration framework to enable automatic calibration of model parameters at a whole of basin scale we proposed a calibration framework fig 1 the framework can be applied in both optimisation based and probabilistic bayesian calibration to determine a probability distribution over parameters e g w√∂hling and vrugt 2011 in this paper the calibration procedure means parameter tuning i e finding the best parameter values by optimising model outputs to observed data the framework includes a hierarchical global calibration strategy the hierarchical calibration aims to maintain basin spatial coherence by calibrating catchments sub basins from upstream to downstream in the order many catchments in the hierarchical calibration can be calibrated in parallel the parallel hierarchical calibration algorithm is presented in section 2 2 in this procedure once upstream catchments are calibrated their parameters are fixed and discharges at their outlets are used to calibrate downstream catchments in other words the calibration of a catchment requires inflows from all upstream catchments and only adjusts parameters at the current catchment by using the fixed and calibrated parameters for all the upstream catchments this procedure implicitly assigns higher priorities to upstream catchments the purpose of this calibration procedure is twofold to avoid optimising a large number of model parameters simultaneously and to provide a benchmark of all catchments for the global calibration global calibration involves a fine tuning of model parameters that have been optimised in hierarchical calibration procedure it is typically required when upstream catchments are allocated with higher priorities than their downstream catchments the optimised parameter set is not physically meaningful or additional calibration criteria are not satisfied for example model parameters need to be optimised with a certain level of maximum flow user intervention or expert knowledge is needed during the global calibration process for example to assign weights priorities to different catchments and or adjust the searching ranges for parameters the optimisation schemes in hierarchical for upstream intermediate and downstream catchments and global calibration are similar and depicted on the left hand side of fig 1 the implementation of such an optimisation scheme includes an objective function or an evaluation function a simulation model an optimiser calibrator to search the parameter space and a period of historical data against which to calibrate the model iteratively depending upon different calibration purposes a single objective measure or multi objective formulation can be used in calibration multi objective calibration methods of hydrological models have been developed e g engeland et al 2006 ercan and goodall 2016 shrestha and rode 2008 the intended applications of the water accounting model are related to water allocation in the mdb and high flows are prioritised over low flows therefore this work focuses on calibrating flow duration curves booker and snelder 2012 li et al 2010 vogel and fennessey 1994 zhang et al 2015 rather than reproducing the exact hydrographs the flow duration curve depicts the relationship between magnitude and frequency of flow showing the percentage of time for which specified flow is equalled or exceeded during a given period it is a useful visual and analytical tool for evaluating flow variability kundu et al 2016 and widely used for water resource assessment and planning particularly for water allocation problems sadegh et al 2016 and the references therein vogel and fennessey 1995 it is also appropriate for the intended purpose of the mdb model for which exact timings of flows i e exact hydrographs are of lesser concern thus a single objective function on the calibration of flow duration curves is selected the objective function represents a numerical measure of the difference between simulated outcomes and observed values the calibration aims to minimise the objective function the objective function for the hierarchical calibration or likelihood function for bayesian calibration is described as the absolute distance between modelled estimates and observations see eq 1 1 f i j 1 m i c i j o i j where f i is the objective function or likelihood function for catchment i m i is the number of monthly observations c i j is the j th ranked calculated monthly estimate for catchment i in the hierarchical calibration and o i j is the j th ranked monthly observation for catchment i the objective function for the global calibration used in this study is given as eq 2 2 f i 1 n Œª i j 1 m i c i j o i j f i where f is the global objective function or likelihood function n is the number of catchments m i is the number of monthly observations for catchment i Œª i represents a weight assigned to catchment i c i j is the j th ranked calculated monthly estimate for catchment i in the global calibration and f i is the optimised objective function or likelihood function for catchment i in the hierarchical calibration 2 2 a fast hierarchical calibration algorithm we also developed an algorithm to perform hierarchical calibration in parallel processing mode with n computer threads or n processors with less computational time table 1 2 3 calibrators our framework can accommodate different calibrators or optimisers known to be highly robust sce is the most widely used calibrator in the practical and research hydrology communities however it tends to be computationally costly kavetski et al 2018 tolson and shoemaker 2007 here we have implemented the clpso and an improved sa he and wang 2007 as calibrators in this framework both calibrators are claimed to achieve high robustness at low cost a semi automatic calibrator was also implemented only for hierarchical calibration for comparison with the clpso and the sa the semi automatic calibrator is based on microsoft office excel s solver and is therefore difficult to extend to global calibration next we briefly overview the clpso and the sa method inspired by the social behaviour of animals pso has been designed as a population based optimisation algorithm kennedy and eberhart 1995 each solution candidate is regarded as a particle and a population of candidates form a swarm these particles move around in the search space and the position of a particle is a potential solution the movements of a particle rely on its previous best position pbest and the swarm s best known position gbest a particle can adjust its velocity to alter the search trajectory based on its own knowledge and other particles knowledge in this way pso integrates the advantages of local and global search techniques to locate the global optimum by balancing the exploitation and exploration aspects in the search space for the sake of pso s performance on complex multimodal problems liang et al 2006 employed a comprehensive learning strategy to extend the conventional pso in contrast with the conventional pso the comprehensive learning strategy 1 uses all particles best known positions pbest s in the population as exemplars to determine a particle s direction 2 allows a particle s dimension to learn from the corresponding dimension of another particle s pbest and 3 forbids a particle to learn from exemplars across all generations in order to make the particle learn from good exemplars and reduce inefficient search on poor directions the learning strategy allows the optimiser to more effectively utilise the information in the swarm to generate high quality solutions to most multimodal problems the clpso has been widely extended to solve other types of optimisation problems such as constrained mixed variable optimisation problems gao and hailu 2010 and multi objective optimisation problems huang et al 2006 the pseudo code for the clpso is demonstrated in supplementary material table a1 we refer the readers to gao and hailu 2010 liang et al 2006 for details concerning algorithm design performance measurement and applications sa is an automatic optimiser that is motivated from an analogy between physical annealing in metallurgy and the strategy of solving optimisation problems the conventional sa is a single solution metaheuristic optimiser kirkpatrick et al 1983 whose central idea is to perturb the solution continuously evaluate the quality of the solution and use a certain probability to accept the worse solution for a more extensive search starting with an initial solution sa produces a new solution in a predefined neighbourhood and evaluates the new solution in each iteration the new solution is compared with the best solution so far in terms of the fitness evaluation function a better new solution is always accepted while a worse new solution is accepted with a boltzmann probability this is a mechanism to probabilistically avoid getting trapped in local optima we implemented a sa calibrator described in he and wang 2007 the pseudo code for the algorithm is presented in supplementary material table a2 2 4 evaluating calibration performance it is necessary to conduct model validation since it can reflect whether the model needs further calibration refinement to quantify the calibration performance we adopted three quantitative evaluation statistics as evaluation indicators nash sutcliffe efficiency nse percent bias pbias and ratio of the root mean square error to the standard deviation of measured data rsr which were recommended by moriasi et al 2007 as the most effective model evaluation techniques moriasi et al 2007 also provided model performance ratings for the three statistics based on evaluation experiments on hydrographs here we used their model performance ratings supplementary material table b1 as rough criteria to evaluate the performance of the two step clpso calibration to validate the model we chose monthly time series flows hydrographs for graphical evaluation a short term observed time series flow data for instance 15 years is used for validation and the remaining time series data for calibration and flow duration curves based on simulated monthly time series flows for quantitative evaluation 2 5 comparison experiments to demonstrate the benefits of the two step clpso calibration tool we compared its calibration results with those obtained from a semi automatic calibration framework to show the relative benefits of both the two step framework and the clpso and from a two step sa calibration approach to show the relative benefit of the clpso the semi automatic calibration was implemented in the early version of the water accounting model spreadsheet version without vba calculations microsoft office excel s solver was used to conduct the calibration of model parameters and can be regarded as a semi automatic optimiser similar to hughes et al 2014 model parameters within each catchment from upstream to downstream were calibrated by the semi automatic calibrator in a cascading fashion simulated outflows from upstream catchments were then used to calibrate the downstream catchments this functionality has not at the time of writing been developed in the vba code version because the solver cannot call a macro that is the solver cannot call the vba water accounting model to compare the calibration accuracy between the clpso and the solver as well as between the clpso and the sa a measure was developed as a ratio of objective functions estimated by the clpso and another approach calibrator for a catchment as shown in eqs 3 and 4 3 r a t i o s o i f i clpso f i solver 4 r a t i o s a i f i clpso f i sa where r a t i o s o i or r a t i o s a i is calibration performance ratios of the clpso to the solver or the sa for catchment i and f i clpso f i solver f i sa are optimal objective functions obtained by the clpso the solver and the sa calibrator for catchment i respectively convergence speed is another important performance indicator of an optimiser which reflects the computational efforts and the searching efficiency of an optimiser to evaluate convergence rates of calibration experiments using the clpso and the sa we selected a normalised measurement called difference ratio as shown in eq 5 5 d i bf i k bf i m a x k bf i m a x k where d i represents the difference ratio for catchment i bf i k is the best objective function value at the k th fitness objective function evaluation ffe for catchment i and bf i m a x k is the best objective function value at the maximum ffe for catchment i we set the number of ffe as 80 000 in the comparison experiments 3 case study mdb water accounting model 3 1 study area and data sources the mdb covers more than one million square kilometres one seventh of mainland australia it is the largest river system in australia and has long played an important role in the nation s agricultural sector it accounts for approximately 40 of the gross value of the nation s agricultural production and approximately 60 of this country s irrigation water use csiro 2008b in this study the mdb is divided into 58 major catchments fig 2 which are aggregates of the rainfall runoff sub catchments identified in csiro 2008a the connection relationship of the 58 catchments is shown in fig 3 where some rivers in the basin are disconnected or are distributaries that end in wetlands for these rivers the outflow does not become the inflow to another river reach but ends as evapotranspiration a discharge is split into downstream catchments based on actual historical pattern and channel capacity constrain the climate dataset was extended from csiro 2008a to 2009 by vaze et al 2011 the land use data were sourced from bryan et al 2009a b 2004 which also included water use calculations for major agricultural crops a flow database for the case study area was established by integrating data sourced from websites of nsw government waterinfo http waterinfo nsw gov au queensland department of natural resources and mines https www dnrm qld gov au victoria s department of environment land water and planning http www2 delwp vic gov au and south australia s department of environment water and natural resources http www environment sa gov au annual data on irrigation were sourced from the mdba report mdba 2011 3 2 model description the mdb water accounting model includes three principal sub models a rainfall runoff model partitions monthly rainfall into runoff and evapotranspiration using a budyko model with monthly storage 2008 a river flow and storage model implements a weak form of routing by allowing for temporary hold up of water from one month to the next irrigation demand and supply is calculated using a crop coefficient irrigation model we applied a mass balance model to each catchment supplementary material fig c1 although some elements are missing in some catchments some lack irrigation for instance we did not consider the contribution of groundwater to water balance a basic mass balance relationship applies to each key entity such as a catchment a river a dam or a whole basin in the mdb water accounting model 6 i n f l o w s o u t f l o w s Œ¥ s t o r a g e s 0 in this way the rainfall runoff model can be written as 7 p i r o 0 where p is rainfall at the land surface and partitioned into runoff r o and infiltration i in eq 7 p is the supply limit the relationship between p and the unfilled space of a generalized surface storage can be built using a budyko like equation budyko 1974 8 i Œ¥ s smax p Œ¥ s smax a 1 1 p Œ¥ s smax a 1 1 a 1 where Œ¥ s smax is the capacity limit see kirby et al 2013 for more details a 1 determines the sharpness of the curve in the relationship between infiltration and the incident rainfall and thus how much runoff is generated by rainfall larger values of a 1 mean more infiltration and lower rainfall the evapotranspiration can be modelled using a similar form as eq 8 9 et et pot s s t Œ¥ t et pot a 2 1 s s t Œ¥ t et pot a 2 1 a 2 where et pot is the potential evapotranspiration s s is the surface storage t is time Œ¥ t is the time step one month and a 2 is a parameter to smooth the transition from s s to et pot water in the generalized surface store can be increased by infiltration but reduced by evapotranspiration as shown in eq 10 10 s s t s s t Œ¥ t i e t river flows can be modelled as a reach water balance 11 q o q i q t r o d l Œ¥ s r where q o q i and q t represent the outflow the inflow and tributary flows of a reach respectively r o is the runoff from the adjacent catchment d is diversions l represents flow losses and Œ¥ s r is the difference between reach storage at two time steps Œ¥ s r s r t s r t Œ¥ t l is calculated as eq 12 12 l q i 1 c loss where c loss 0 c loss 1 is a parameter the reach storage can also be modelled as a function of q i which is specified in eq 13 13 s r c 1 q i where c 1 is a parameter we refer readers to kirby et al 2013 for the sub model of the irrigation demand and supply as well as further details on modelling methods and application of the water accounting model in scenario simulation the model was developed in a microsoft excel spreadsheet where the bulk of the calculations were done in a visual basic for applications vba macro the spreadsheet contains all the input data needed to define the model the vba macro calculates runoff flows and diversions and the results are written to output worksheets graphing and subsidiary calculations may be performed as required in the output worksheets the model parameters of an earlier spreadsheet only version without the vba macro were calibrated using solver in excel which was used to minimise the absolute distance between modelled estimates and observations in eq 1 by varying model parameter values this cannot be done in the vba version of the model because solver cannot call a macro 3 3 model parameters the model parameters to be optimised table 2 were identified by the water accounting model developers for complex models in which developers lack confidence in identifying influential parameters a global sensitivity analysis gao and bryan 2016 gao et al 2016 saltelli et al 2008 can provide insights about the mapping of model inputs to model outputs the runoff into any reach must equal the sum of the outflow losses diversions and changes to storage minus the sum of the inflows this holds true for any period from a single month to the full length of the record under consideration by varying s max and parameters a 1 and a 2 in eqs 8 and 9 the sum of the runoff over the full period is set to approximately equal the sum over the full period of the outflows and changes to storage less the sum of the inflows larger values of s max and smaller values of a 1 and a 2 lead to more non linear behaviour in which runoff ratios decline more sharply in extended dry periods and with greater peak flows in wet periods the storage in a reach affects the peak flows and the rate of recession from peak flows a proportion of the flow is stored and then becomes available for the flow in the next time period larger values of c 1 in eq 13 lead to greater reductions in peak flows and longer recession curves c 1 can be adjusted to minimize the sums of squares of deviations between measured and observed flows the major rivers lose water particularly in the lower sections and the value of c loss is similarly adjusted to improve the fit of calculated flow duration curves to observed ones 4 results based on the calibration methodology described above a number of experiments were carried out to examine the effects of the proposed calibration solution and the performance of clpso calibrator we began by investigating the calibration effects of the water accounting model 4 1 calibration and validation performance of the mdb model under the clpso based two step framework since the intended purpose of the mdb model is to evaluate flow variability for water reallocation under different climate conditions see kirby et al 2014 kirby et al 2015 this work focuses on the calibration of flow magnitude and frequency during the period when climatic and hydrologic records are available the graphical comparisons between observed flow duration curves and simulated ones using the optimal parameter set for 57 catchments there is no observation data for the river murray at the mouth which is the outlet of the 58th catchment in the model are shown in fig 4 the figure indicates that the proposed calibration solution leads to satisfactory simulation of flow duration curves especially for high flows that are important in integrated hydro economic scenario simulation performance indicators of calibrated models for 57 catchments are demonstrated in table 3 we found that aside from the site warrego fordsbridge the nse values for calibrating flow duration curves for 56 catchment sites ranged from 0 76 to 1 00 these values indicated that simulated flow duration curves perform very well 0 75 n s e 1 00 based on model performance ratings supplementary material table b1 the rsr values for the above 56 catchment sites varied from 0 05 to 0 49 meaning model performance for residual variations of simulated flow duration curves have a very good range 0 00 r s r 0 50 the pbias values for all flow duration curve calibrations ranged from 20 34 to 24 92 these values show the average magnitude of simulated flow duration curves range from satisfactory to very good based on model performance ratings based on performance ratings of the three types of indicators the performance of 47 calibrated catchments could be evaluated as very good with 0 75 n s e 1 00 0 00 r s r 0 50 and pbias 10 we used 15 years observed time series flow data from 1995 to 2009 for validation and the remaining time series data for calibration fig 5 shows the calibrated and validated monthly flows in the murray river at hume and the darling river at burtundy as could be seen from the visual inspection of hydrographs in the figure the calibration is successful with relatively good prediction the calibrated time series flows fit the observation well the simulations capture most of high and low flow events although the calibration was conducted against flow duration curves rather than time series flow data the fitting performance of validated time series flows is slightly worse than that of calibrated ones but exhibits sufficient accuracy for water resource prediction in our hydro economic applications 4 2 effects of global calibration on catchment calibration the global calibration is a required and useful procedure to adjust the parameter set optimised by the hierarchical calibration practically according to different needs there are a few ways to set up global calibration targets and carry out calibration experiments we used the objective function described in eq 2 as the global calibration target and adjusted the searching ranges of some parameters in order for better calculation performance the weights assigned to catchments were set as identical four catchment observation sites campaspe barn campaspe roch murray swanhill and murray wakooljunct were selected to demonstrate the effects of hierarchical and global calibration fig 6 since campaspe barn and murray swanhill are upstream catchments of campaspe roch and murray wakooljunct respectively over calibration of these two upstream catchments results in poor effects of the calibration on downstream catchments fig 6 a d the global calibration is able to mitigate the deficiency as shown in the bottom row in fig 6 after the global calibration was executed the optimal objective function values of the upstream catchments increased comparing to those obtained by the hierarchical calibration the increase of the optimal objective function values means worse fitting effects between observed and simulated flow duration curves and this is also reflected in the graphical hydrographs however the concessions of fitting effects made by upstream catchments bring improvements in the calibration of downstream catchments the minimum objective function values for campaspe roch and murray wakooljunct are only 24 and 15 of those in the hierarchical calibration respectively visually the calibration effects of campaspe roch and murray wakooljunct are dramatically improved the minimum objective function value for the combined upstream and downstream catchments such as campaspe barn and campaspe roch was significantly improved in both cases 4 3 the two step calibration versus the semi automatic calibration the two step calibration framework with the clpso as the calibrator performs much better than the semi automatic calibration approach with excel solver see the ratio in eq 3 for each catchment shown in fig 4 although the solution accuracy of the solver on calibrating 4 in 57 catchments is superior to that of the two step calibration the average calibration performance ratio of the two step calibration to the semi automatic calibration over 57 catchments is 0 59 meaning that the two step calibration has approximately 40 improvement in flow duration curve calibration across all catchments 4 4 the clpso versus the sa under the two step calibration framework the solution accuracy of the sa is better than that of the solver but still worse than that of the clpso only 14 in 57 catchments calibrated by the sa perform better than those calibrated by the clpso fig 4 we have illustrated the superiority of the clpso calibrator in solution accuracy below we report the convergence characteristics of the clpso calibrator fig 7 presents the means and standard deviations of difference ratios see equation 5 over 57 catchments in the clpso calibrator the maximum number of ffes equals the product of population size n of swarm s and the total number of iterations generations as ffe equals 40 000 the average difference ratio which shows the average difference between the current best fitness value and final best fitness value is 1 26 when ffe is 60000 the ratio is only 0 27 this value demonstrates the calibration effect with 60 000 ffes is good enough since the remaining 20 000 ffe efforts only improve less than 0 3 the standard deviation continuously decreases with values 2 59 at 40 000 ffe and 0 96 at 60 000 ffe the dynamics of the standard deviations indicates the convergence of the clpso is stable the convergence performance of the clpso was also compared to the sa calibrator fig 7 at the initial 15 000 ffes the sa calibrator shows good convergence capability and the average difference ratios obtained from it are well below those obtained from the clpso after that the persistent convergence of the clpso calibrator leads to lower difference ratios relative to those in the sa case the standard deviations of difference ratios obtained by the sa calibrator are greater indicating that in terms of the convergence stability robustness the clpso is superior to the sa 5 discussion 5 1 effectiveness of the two step calibration solution it is difficult to effectively calibrate a basin scale hydrological model with complex model structure non linear component interactions and a substantial number of model parameters 5 57 285 in our case we have presented a hierarchical global calibration approach that performs calibration from upstream catchments to downstream ones and fine tunes the hierarchical calibration results we have shown that the hierarchical calibration has very good performance on flow duration curve calibration this calibration procedure based on flow duration curve also provided good calibration performance and acceptable prediction ability for time series flows hydrographs the global calibration procedure offers an opportunity to adjust the results from the hierarchical calibration based on specific needs the example provided in section 4 2 demonstrated that the calibration performance for downstream catchments could be significantly improved in the global calibration process by sacrificing some performance for upstream catchments the hierarchical calibration used a divide and conquer approach to reduce computation demands and maintain spatial coherence the hierarchical calibration results can be further tailored to a specific application based on user or expert information in the global calibration process and expert knowledge can be incorporated to reduce uncertainty the intended applications of the calibrated model are in exploring water allocation strategies and thus fitting quality in high flows is emphasised towards this end we focused on calibrating flow duration curves and chosen a measure of distance between ranked simulated and observed monthly flows the two step calibration framework with the clpso as the calibrator led to very good calibration performance in 47 of the total 57 calibrated catchments based on the indicators of nse rsr and pbias table 3 with additional five catchments being evaluated as good and four being measured as satisfactory the catchment warrego fordsbridge was the only exception that was evaluated as unsatisfactory due to a relative high mismatch in high flows both the visual calibration fig 4 and validation fig 5 results from the calibration framework indicate that the calibrated model is qualified for our intended purpose of water resources prediction and allocation 5 2 comparing the two step calibration with existing calibration approaches the two step calibration is an automatic calibration framework allowing for a fast and flexible way to produce very skillful model simulations in practice many water accounting models are still manually calibrated however manual calibration is much slower and to obtain satisfactory calibration performance greatly depends on the knowledge and experience of the modeller the automatic calibration framework allows for the accommodation of different calibrators and supports a parallel processing mode the selection of a better calibrator can further improve the efficiency of the calibration framework the calibration of a large scale such as basin scale water accounting model is often conducted either manually or automatically on each component such as catchment gauge or reach of the basin system separately some work e g ajami et al 2004 considered little on fluxes from outside of the component within the system when these calibrated individual components are linked together and work as a whole system omitted fluxes from upstream components will influence the downstream behaviours result in inconsistencies and propagate simulation errors across all downstream components hughes et al 2016 the other work e g hughes et al 2014 considered rive network calibration as opposed to the above isolated component calibration where simulated fluxes from the upstream components were then used to calibrate the next downstream components however these studies implicitly set higher priorities to upstream components without any system level adjustment in this way the calibrated parameters might be physically meaningless violate calibration criteria for the whole river system or suffer from the over fitting especially where observations were erroneous meanwhile these work lacked of a parallel mechanism to support efficient automatic calibration the proposed framework can effectively reduce spatial error propagation and calibrate model parameters in an efficient and systematic fashion compared with the semi automatic calibration using the microsoft office excel solver to conduct catchment by catchment calibration of model parameters within each catchment the two step calibration using the clpso has improved 40 in flow duration curve calculation and is more accurate in 93 of 57 catchments the framework is able to avoid dealing with highly dimensional and many objective calibration tasks with the rise of the number of parameters to be optimised finding the optimum is increasingly difficult for calibrators and the computational load increases exponentially especially where the calibration space is rough and multimodal in this case study applying a system wide calibration to simultaneously deal with the calibration problem with 285 5 57 parameters and goodness of fits of 57 catchments is difficult and computationally expensive while the two step calibration presents a hierarchical way to reduce the computational cost and then manages the tradeoffs of all components goodness of fits in terms of expert knowledge or model predictive needs 5 3 calibration performance of the clpso effectiveness efficiency and robustness are three significant aspects to evaluate calibration performance and compare different calibrators gao and hailu 2010 the clpso outperformed the sa in solution accuracy in 75 of the modelled catchments the mean and standard deviation trends of difference ratios fig 7 reflect superiority of the clpso to the sa in calibration efficiency and robustness the clpso improved standard pso in enabling all searching particles to learn from good particles and to largely avoid low efficient exploration of poor directions this improvement gives the clpso an outstanding capability of dealing with complex multimodal problems the calibration results and comparisons with the sa demonstrate that the clpso can improve calibration performance with regard to effectiveness efficiency and robustness a global sensitivity analysis gao and bryan 2016 gao et al 2016 saltelli et al 2008 is recommended to help modellers to screen out non influential parameters so that the calibration performance can be further improved by reducing the number of model parameters to be calibrated 5 4 limitations and future directions there are a number of limitations and possibilities for further investigation with respect to improve the calibration of the mdb water accounting model hydrologic model predictability is subject to not only the calibration method itself but also the availability and quality of observation data used for calibration our step wise calibration approach is applicable to hydrologic models built for managed or working rivers which are comprehensively gauged there are many examples of such rivers throughout the world and therefore many relevant applications for our approach for other rivers that have insufficient streamflow gauge stations spatially distributed remotely sensed data such as the evapotranspiration et data from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis can be used as an effective data resource for the calibration of hydrologic models for example rajib et al 2018 improved hydrologic model predictability by calibrating 29 sub basins separately with 29 representative time series of modis et one for each sub basin and only one time series of streamflow data from the outlet of the basin additionally through the calibration process uncertainty in the calibration data is converted into uncertainty in the estimated model parameters and other inferred quantities our future work includes the integration of bayesian inference schemes peeters et al 2018 renard et al 2010 into the proposed step wise calibration framework allowing the quantification of this derived parametric uncertainty multi objective optimisation methods gao et al 2014 marler and arora 2004 are increasingly used in the calibration of hydrological models bekele and nicklow 2007 rajib et al 2016 to produce a pareto set of optimal parameters in regard to several calibration objectives what we would like to explore in the future is incorporating pareto dominance into the clpso in order to allow this calibrator to handle calibration with several objective functions for example in the case study model multiple objectives to be calibrated include flow duration curves time series flows and diversions one major difficulty regarding the calibration of the water accounting model is the expensive computational demands therefore one aspect that we would like to investigate is translating the model from microsoft excel vba macro to other languages such as python and utilising high performance computing technologies bryan 2013 6 conclusions whole of basin hydrological models are needed to better manage the great river basins of the world which are threatened by a range of processes including climate change over extraction and declines in water quality and flows best 2019 bryan et al 2018 however the lack of an effective means of calibrating these complex many parameter hydrological models has potentially restricted their development and application we developed a new and effective calibration framework to improve the simulation accuracy of basin scale hydrological models it involves a hierarchical global calibration strategy aiming at effectively estimating a large number of model parameters and balancing trade offs among objective functions for all catchments the strategy includes a parallel processing algorithm to enable fast calibration for the hierarchical calibration and expert knowledge is usually required to facilitate the global adjustment of calibration outcomes considering excellent performance of locating global optima we implemented the clpso as a main calibrator in this framework although other methods could also be used several calibration experiments were conducted in order to examine the effects of the two step clpso calibration tool the visual and quantitative calibration effects indicated that the calibration tool could lead to satisfactory model outcomes with sufficient accuracy for the model s intended purpose the calibrated tool was also able to accurately simulate and predict time series flows global calibration significantly improved the calibration results obtained by the hierarchical calibration this work offers a useful tool for calibrating complex whole of basin hydrological models and reduces a significant barrier to the more widespread development of large scale river basin modelling to support the better management of the

5935,we present a two step framework for calibrating complex many parameter hydrological models at basin scale the framework first calibrates parameters for each catchment sub basin sequentially and then fine tunes parameters as needed we implemented a comprehensive learning particle swarm optimiser clpso as the calibrator and applied the two step clpso tool in calibrating parameters of a water accounting model for the murray darling basin australia the visual and quantitative results indicated that our tool produced satisfactory calibration and prediction outcomes for the model s intended purpose the comparison experiments demonstrated that the calibration framework and the clpso were competent in calibrating large scale hydrological models this framework can guarantee spatial coherence balance objective trade offs among all catchments and calibrate many parameters at a low computational cost by providing better parameter estimates in complex whole of basin hydrological models our calibration tool has the potential to increase the development and application of these models and thereby improve the management of large river basins keywords model calibration parameterisation particle swarm optimisation hydrological models rivers irrigation 1 introduction hydro economic models have been increasingly used in capturing the complexity of interactions between water and economy and helping water resource managers address water scarcity and reduce water demand conflicts graveline 2016 harou et al 2009 mainuddin et al 2007 qureshi et al 2007 these hydro economic models often integrate management options and economic values into a detailed hydrological component which represents appropriate complexity and heterogeneity of a water resource system the hydrological component in some cases needs to reflect large basin scale hydrological dynamics that is affected by policy changes however most hydrological models especially conceptual rainfall runoff models are calibrated at a catchment scale capitalising on the reduced hydrologic physiographic and socio economic complexity at this scale in contrast large scale whole of basin hydrological models are characterised by expanded model structures covering heterogeneous environmental and socio economic conditions complex reach connection relationships and require a substantial number of model parameters to be estimated in the relatively few studies that have addressed hydrological model calibration across multiple sites catchments sub basins either a single parameter set is employed for all catchments e g engeland et al 2006 khakbaz et al 2012 wang et al 2012 or multiple catchments sites are treated individually from upstream to downstream e g ajami et al 2004 hughes et al 2014 however since hydrologic systems often exhibit a large degree of spatial heterogeneity in their characteristics grayson and bloeschl 2000 approaches which regard model parameters as identical for all catchments are inadequate similarly multi site calibration experiments e g andersen et al 2001 have demonstrated that the calibration performance in downstream catchments may be affected by the performance upstream this suggests that uncertainties and or compensation of errors will propagate downstream and affect the overall calibration of the model thus the calibration of individual sites ignoring hydrological connectivity while an improvement on single site approaches is also insufficient meanwhile this calibration fashion showed up low efficiency to address this some researchers have proposed a system wide approach enabling a simultaneous calibration for the systematic evaluation of the trade offs among objective functions from all catchments e g shrestha and rode 2008 but this approach raises two challenges one is that when applied at a whole of basin scale a large number of model parameters for related catchments may need calibrating simultaneously for example a hydrological model for the murray darling basin mdb requires calibrating model parameters for 58 connected catchments csiro 2008a the second challenge is the trade offs among objective functions for all catchments an objective function provides a measurement of similarity between observed and estimated outputs molina navarro et al 2017 the similarity degree calibration space data availability and uncertainty levels for catchments differ therefore a normalisation procedure is required before balancing the objective functions from all catchments however finding a suitable weighting function used in the system normalisation procedure is difficult hughes et al 2015 to overcome these challenges this paper adds new dimension to large scale hydrologic model calibration by enhancing individual catchment level sub basin level step wise parameter calibration introduced by rajib et al 2018 via a novel two step hierarchical global approach the hierarchical calibration is responsible for guaranteeing catchment level spatial coherence allowing model calibration at a whole of basin scale with low computational cost the global calibration is used for fine tuning of parameters based on model predictive needs or expert knowledge there has been a historical trend away from manual calibration methods towards more automatic procedures two calibration strategies are commonly used to automatically explore the parameter space local and global methods kavetski et al 2018 robustness capability of consistently locating the optimal parameter set and computational cost often represented by the number of objective function evaluations or cpu time required to find the optimal parameter set are two key performance indicators for evaluating these automatic calibrators kavetski et al 2018 local calibration methods such as gauss newton type methods qin et al 2018b usually converge fast but tend to get trapped in a local optimum when solving multimodal problems popular global methods to automatically calibrate hydrological models are evolutionary algorithms eas maier et al 2014 such as genetic algorithms ga seibert 2000 shuffled complex evolution sce duan et al 1992 and simulated annealing sa sumner et al 1997 a large number of studies have concluded that eas perform better than local methods in finding the global optimum e g gao et al 2006 madsen et al 2002 but tend to be computationally expensive qin et al 2018a a relatively new ea particle swarm optimisation pso was first proposed by kennedy and eberhart 1995 it is an algorithm inspired by the social behaviour of animals such as bird flocking and fish schooling pso has gained popularity lately and has been applied widely including to the automatic calibration of hydrological models jiang et al 2013 thiemig et al 2013 zambrano bigiarini and rojas 2013 compared to conventional eas generally which have strong global search ability but low convergence speed and computational efficiency zhang et al 2009 pso is attractive due to its simplicity of implementation and its ability to quickly converge to a reasonably good solution however similar to ga the standard pso may get trapped in local optima especially when solving complex multimodal problems liang et al 2006 here a comprehensive learning particle swarm optimiser clpso gao and hailu 2010 liang et al 2006 is used to improve the standard pso s performance on complex multimodal problems aiming to outperform conventional eas in both robustness and computational cost in this study we present a transparent and automated hierarchical global clpso calibration tool for basin scale hydrological model calibration we applied our calibration tool to a water accounting model for the mdb australia s largest river system kirby et al 2013 the model was designed for and has been used to supply scenario information for a range of economic analyses e g kirby et al 2014 kirby et al 2015 the hydrological model discussed in this paper provides monthly estimates of runoff river flow diversions and losses for the mdb compared with daily water accounting models monthly models have the advantage of needing only monthly data and have lower computational cost wang et al 2011 so that iterative solutions ea based calibration for example could be obtained we evaluate the performance of the calibration tool and discuss its utility for broad application to whole of basin models of large complex river systems 2 methods 2 1 two step automatic calibration framework to enable automatic calibration of model parameters at a whole of basin scale we proposed a calibration framework fig 1 the framework can be applied in both optimisation based and probabilistic bayesian calibration to determine a probability distribution over parameters e g w√∂hling and vrugt 2011 in this paper the calibration procedure means parameter tuning i e finding the best parameter values by optimising model outputs to observed data the framework includes a hierarchical global calibration strategy the hierarchical calibration aims to maintain basin spatial coherence by calibrating catchments sub basins from upstream to downstream in the order many catchments in the hierarchical calibration can be calibrated in parallel the parallel hierarchical calibration algorithm is presented in section 2 2 in this procedure once upstream catchments are calibrated their parameters are fixed and discharges at their outlets are used to calibrate downstream catchments in other words the calibration of a catchment requires inflows from all upstream catchments and only adjusts parameters at the current catchment by using the fixed and calibrated parameters for all the upstream catchments this procedure implicitly assigns higher priorities to upstream catchments the purpose of this calibration procedure is twofold to avoid optimising a large number of model parameters simultaneously and to provide a benchmark of all catchments for the global calibration global calibration involves a fine tuning of model parameters that have been optimised in hierarchical calibration procedure it is typically required when upstream catchments are allocated with higher priorities than their downstream catchments the optimised parameter set is not physically meaningful or additional calibration criteria are not satisfied for example model parameters need to be optimised with a certain level of maximum flow user intervention or expert knowledge is needed during the global calibration process for example to assign weights priorities to different catchments and or adjust the searching ranges for parameters the optimisation schemes in hierarchical for upstream intermediate and downstream catchments and global calibration are similar and depicted on the left hand side of fig 1 the implementation of such an optimisation scheme includes an objective function or an evaluation function a simulation model an optimiser calibrator to search the parameter space and a period of historical data against which to calibrate the model iteratively depending upon different calibration purposes a single objective measure or multi objective formulation can be used in calibration multi objective calibration methods of hydrological models have been developed e g engeland et al 2006 ercan and goodall 2016 shrestha and rode 2008 the intended applications of the water accounting model are related to water allocation in the mdb and high flows are prioritised over low flows therefore this work focuses on calibrating flow duration curves booker and snelder 2012 li et al 2010 vogel and fennessey 1994 zhang et al 2015 rather than reproducing the exact hydrographs the flow duration curve depicts the relationship between magnitude and frequency of flow showing the percentage of time for which specified flow is equalled or exceeded during a given period it is a useful visual and analytical tool for evaluating flow variability kundu et al 2016 and widely used for water resource assessment and planning particularly for water allocation problems sadegh et al 2016 and the references therein vogel and fennessey 1995 it is also appropriate for the intended purpose of the mdb model for which exact timings of flows i e exact hydrographs are of lesser concern thus a single objective function on the calibration of flow duration curves is selected the objective function represents a numerical measure of the difference between simulated outcomes and observed values the calibration aims to minimise the objective function the objective function for the hierarchical calibration or likelihood function for bayesian calibration is described as the absolute distance between modelled estimates and observations see eq 1 1 f i j 1 m i c i j o i j where f i is the objective function or likelihood function for catchment i m i is the number of monthly observations c i j is the j th ranked calculated monthly estimate for catchment i in the hierarchical calibration and o i j is the j th ranked monthly observation for catchment i the objective function for the global calibration used in this study is given as eq 2 2 f i 1 n Œª i j 1 m i c i j o i j f i where f is the global objective function or likelihood function n is the number of catchments m i is the number of monthly observations for catchment i Œª i represents a weight assigned to catchment i c i j is the j th ranked calculated monthly estimate for catchment i in the global calibration and f i is the optimised objective function or likelihood function for catchment i in the hierarchical calibration 2 2 a fast hierarchical calibration algorithm we also developed an algorithm to perform hierarchical calibration in parallel processing mode with n computer threads or n processors with less computational time table 1 2 3 calibrators our framework can accommodate different calibrators or optimisers known to be highly robust sce is the most widely used calibrator in the practical and research hydrology communities however it tends to be computationally costly kavetski et al 2018 tolson and shoemaker 2007 here we have implemented the clpso and an improved sa he and wang 2007 as calibrators in this framework both calibrators are claimed to achieve high robustness at low cost a semi automatic calibrator was also implemented only for hierarchical calibration for comparison with the clpso and the sa the semi automatic calibrator is based on microsoft office excel s solver and is therefore difficult to extend to global calibration next we briefly overview the clpso and the sa method inspired by the social behaviour of animals pso has been designed as a population based optimisation algorithm kennedy and eberhart 1995 each solution candidate is regarded as a particle and a population of candidates form a swarm these particles move around in the search space and the position of a particle is a potential solution the movements of a particle rely on its previous best position pbest and the swarm s best known position gbest a particle can adjust its velocity to alter the search trajectory based on its own knowledge and other particles knowledge in this way pso integrates the advantages of local and global search techniques to locate the global optimum by balancing the exploitation and exploration aspects in the search space for the sake of pso s performance on complex multimodal problems liang et al 2006 employed a comprehensive learning strategy to extend the conventional pso in contrast with the conventional pso the comprehensive learning strategy 1 uses all particles best known positions pbest s in the population as exemplars to determine a particle s direction 2 allows a particle s dimension to learn from the corresponding dimension of another particle s pbest and 3 forbids a particle to learn from exemplars across all generations in order to make the particle learn from good exemplars and reduce inefficient search on poor directions the learning strategy allows the optimiser to more effectively utilise the information in the swarm to generate high quality solutions to most multimodal problems the clpso has been widely extended to solve other types of optimisation problems such as constrained mixed variable optimisation problems gao and hailu 2010 and multi objective optimisation problems huang et al 2006 the pseudo code for the clpso is demonstrated in supplementary material table a1 we refer the readers to gao and hailu 2010 liang et al 2006 for details concerning algorithm design performance measurement and applications sa is an automatic optimiser that is motivated from an analogy between physical annealing in metallurgy and the strategy of solving optimisation problems the conventional sa is a single solution metaheuristic optimiser kirkpatrick et al 1983 whose central idea is to perturb the solution continuously evaluate the quality of the solution and use a certain probability to accept the worse solution for a more extensive search starting with an initial solution sa produces a new solution in a predefined neighbourhood and evaluates the new solution in each iteration the new solution is compared with the best solution so far in terms of the fitness evaluation function a better new solution is always accepted while a worse new solution is accepted with a boltzmann probability this is a mechanism to probabilistically avoid getting trapped in local optima we implemented a sa calibrator described in he and wang 2007 the pseudo code for the algorithm is presented in supplementary material table a2 2 4 evaluating calibration performance it is necessary to conduct model validation since it can reflect whether the model needs further calibration refinement to quantify the calibration performance we adopted three quantitative evaluation statistics as evaluation indicators nash sutcliffe efficiency nse percent bias pbias and ratio of the root mean square error to the standard deviation of measured data rsr which were recommended by moriasi et al 2007 as the most effective model evaluation techniques moriasi et al 2007 also provided model performance ratings for the three statistics based on evaluation experiments on hydrographs here we used their model performance ratings supplementary material table b1 as rough criteria to evaluate the performance of the two step clpso calibration to validate the model we chose monthly time series flows hydrographs for graphical evaluation a short term observed time series flow data for instance 15 years is used for validation and the remaining time series data for calibration and flow duration curves based on simulated monthly time series flows for quantitative evaluation 2 5 comparison experiments to demonstrate the benefits of the two step clpso calibration tool we compared its calibration results with those obtained from a semi automatic calibration framework to show the relative benefits of both the two step framework and the clpso and from a two step sa calibration approach to show the relative benefit of the clpso the semi automatic calibration was implemented in the early version of the water accounting model spreadsheet version without vba calculations microsoft office excel s solver was used to conduct the calibration of model parameters and can be regarded as a semi automatic optimiser similar to hughes et al 2014 model parameters within each catchment from upstream to downstream were calibrated by the semi automatic calibrator in a cascading fashion simulated outflows from upstream catchments were then used to calibrate the downstream catchments this functionality has not at the time of writing been developed in the vba code version because the solver cannot call a macro that is the solver cannot call the vba water accounting model to compare the calibration accuracy between the clpso and the solver as well as between the clpso and the sa a measure was developed as a ratio of objective functions estimated by the clpso and another approach calibrator for a catchment as shown in eqs 3 and 4 3 r a t i o s o i f i clpso f i solver 4 r a t i o s a i f i clpso f i sa where r a t i o s o i or r a t i o s a i is calibration performance ratios of the clpso to the solver or the sa for catchment i and f i clpso f i solver f i sa are optimal objective functions obtained by the clpso the solver and the sa calibrator for catchment i respectively convergence speed is another important performance indicator of an optimiser which reflects the computational efforts and the searching efficiency of an optimiser to evaluate convergence rates of calibration experiments using the clpso and the sa we selected a normalised measurement called difference ratio as shown in eq 5 5 d i bf i k bf i m a x k bf i m a x k where d i represents the difference ratio for catchment i bf i k is the best objective function value at the k th fitness objective function evaluation ffe for catchment i and bf i m a x k is the best objective function value at the maximum ffe for catchment i we set the number of ffe as 80 000 in the comparison experiments 3 case study mdb water accounting model 3 1 study area and data sources the mdb covers more than one million square kilometres one seventh of mainland australia it is the largest river system in australia and has long played an important role in the nation s agricultural sector it accounts for approximately 40 of the gross value of the nation s agricultural production and approximately 60 of this country s irrigation water use csiro 2008b in this study the mdb is divided into 58 major catchments fig 2 which are aggregates of the rainfall runoff sub catchments identified in csiro 2008a the connection relationship of the 58 catchments is shown in fig 3 where some rivers in the basin are disconnected or are distributaries that end in wetlands for these rivers the outflow does not become the inflow to another river reach but ends as evapotranspiration a discharge is split into downstream catchments based on actual historical pattern and channel capacity constrain the climate dataset was extended from csiro 2008a to 2009 by vaze et al 2011 the land use data were sourced from bryan et al 2009a b 2004 which also included water use calculations for major agricultural crops a flow database for the case study area was established by integrating data sourced from websites of nsw government waterinfo http waterinfo nsw gov au queensland department of natural resources and mines https www dnrm qld gov au victoria s department of environment land water and planning http www2 delwp vic gov au and south australia s department of environment water and natural resources http www environment sa gov au annual data on irrigation were sourced from the mdba report mdba 2011 3 2 model description the mdb water accounting model includes three principal sub models a rainfall runoff model partitions monthly rainfall into runoff and evapotranspiration using a budyko model with monthly storage 2008 a river flow and storage model implements a weak form of routing by allowing for temporary hold up of water from one month to the next irrigation demand and supply is calculated using a crop coefficient irrigation model we applied a mass balance model to each catchment supplementary material fig c1 although some elements are missing in some catchments some lack irrigation for instance we did not consider the contribution of groundwater to water balance a basic mass balance relationship applies to each key entity such as a catchment a river a dam or a whole basin in the mdb water accounting model 6 i n f l o w s o u t f l o w s Œ¥ s t o r a g e s 0 in this way the rainfall runoff model can be written as 7 p i r o 0 where p is rainfall at the land surface and partitioned into runoff r o and infiltration i in eq 7 p is the supply limit the relationship between p and the unfilled space of a generalized surface storage can be built using a budyko like equation budyko 1974 8 i Œ¥ s smax p Œ¥ s smax a 1 1 p Œ¥ s smax a 1 1 a 1 where Œ¥ s smax is the capacity limit see kirby et al 2013 for more details a 1 determines the sharpness of the curve in the relationship between infiltration and the incident rainfall and thus how much runoff is generated by rainfall larger values of a 1 mean more infiltration and lower rainfall the evapotranspiration can be modelled using a similar form as eq 8 9 et et pot s s t Œ¥ t et pot a 2 1 s s t Œ¥ t et pot a 2 1 a 2 where et pot is the potential evapotranspiration s s is the surface storage t is time Œ¥ t is the time step one month and a 2 is a parameter to smooth the transition from s s to et pot water in the generalized surface store can be increased by infiltration but reduced by evapotranspiration as shown in eq 10 10 s s t s s t Œ¥ t i e t river flows can be modelled as a reach water balance 11 q o q i q t r o d l Œ¥ s r where q o q i and q t represent the outflow the inflow and tributary flows of a reach respectively r o is the runoff from the adjacent catchment d is diversions l represents flow losses and Œ¥ s r is the difference between reach storage at two time steps Œ¥ s r s r t s r t Œ¥ t l is calculated as eq 12 12 l q i 1 c loss where c loss 0 c loss 1 is a parameter the reach storage can also be modelled as a function of q i which is specified in eq 13 13 s r c 1 q i where c 1 is a parameter we refer readers to kirby et al 2013 for the sub model of the irrigation demand and supply as well as further details on modelling methods and application of the water accounting model in scenario simulation the model was developed in a microsoft excel spreadsheet where the bulk of the calculations were done in a visual basic for applications vba macro the spreadsheet contains all the input data needed to define the model the vba macro calculates runoff flows and diversions and the results are written to output worksheets graphing and subsidiary calculations may be performed as required in the output worksheets the model parameters of an earlier spreadsheet only version without the vba macro were calibrated using solver in excel which was used to minimise the absolute distance between modelled estimates and observations in eq 1 by varying model parameter values this cannot be done in the vba version of the model because solver cannot call a macro 3 3 model parameters the model parameters to be optimised table 2 were identified by the water accounting model developers for complex models in which developers lack confidence in identifying influential parameters a global sensitivity analysis gao and bryan 2016 gao et al 2016 saltelli et al 2008 can provide insights about the mapping of model inputs to model outputs the runoff into any reach must equal the sum of the outflow losses diversions and changes to storage minus the sum of the inflows this holds true for any period from a single month to the full length of the record under consideration by varying s max and parameters a 1 and a 2 in eqs 8 and 9 the sum of the runoff over the full period is set to approximately equal the sum over the full period of the outflows and changes to storage less the sum of the inflows larger values of s max and smaller values of a 1 and a 2 lead to more non linear behaviour in which runoff ratios decline more sharply in extended dry periods and with greater peak flows in wet periods the storage in a reach affects the peak flows and the rate of recession from peak flows a proportion of the flow is stored and then becomes available for the flow in the next time period larger values of c 1 in eq 13 lead to greater reductions in peak flows and longer recession curves c 1 can be adjusted to minimize the sums of squares of deviations between measured and observed flows the major rivers lose water particularly in the lower sections and the value of c loss is similarly adjusted to improve the fit of calculated flow duration curves to observed ones 4 results based on the calibration methodology described above a number of experiments were carried out to examine the effects of the proposed calibration solution and the performance of clpso calibrator we began by investigating the calibration effects of the water accounting model 4 1 calibration and validation performance of the mdb model under the clpso based two step framework since the intended purpose of the mdb model is to evaluate flow variability for water reallocation under different climate conditions see kirby et al 2014 kirby et al 2015 this work focuses on the calibration of flow magnitude and frequency during the period when climatic and hydrologic records are available the graphical comparisons between observed flow duration curves and simulated ones using the optimal parameter set for 57 catchments there is no observation data for the river murray at the mouth which is the outlet of the 58th catchment in the model are shown in fig 4 the figure indicates that the proposed calibration solution leads to satisfactory simulation of flow duration curves especially for high flows that are important in integrated hydro economic scenario simulation performance indicators of calibrated models for 57 catchments are demonstrated in table 3 we found that aside from the site warrego fordsbridge the nse values for calibrating flow duration curves for 56 catchment sites ranged from 0 76 to 1 00 these values indicated that simulated flow duration curves perform very well 0 75 n s e 1 00 based on model performance ratings supplementary material table b1 the rsr values for the above 56 catchment sites varied from 0 05 to 0 49 meaning model performance for residual variations of simulated flow duration curves have a very good range 0 00 r s r 0 50 the pbias values for all flow duration curve calibrations ranged from 20 34 to 24 92 these values show the average magnitude of simulated flow duration curves range from satisfactory to very good based on model performance ratings based on performance ratings of the three types of indicators the performance of 47 calibrated catchments could be evaluated as very good with 0 75 n s e 1 00 0 00 r s r 0 50 and pbias 10 we used 15 years observed time series flow data from 1995 to 2009 for validation and the remaining time series data for calibration fig 5 shows the calibrated and validated monthly flows in the murray river at hume and the darling river at burtundy as could be seen from the visual inspection of hydrographs in the figure the calibration is successful with relatively good prediction the calibrated time series flows fit the observation well the simulations capture most of high and low flow events although the calibration was conducted against flow duration curves rather than time series flow data the fitting performance of validated time series flows is slightly worse than that of calibrated ones but exhibits sufficient accuracy for water resource prediction in our hydro economic applications 4 2 effects of global calibration on catchment calibration the global calibration is a required and useful procedure to adjust the parameter set optimised by the hierarchical calibration practically according to different needs there are a few ways to set up global calibration targets and carry out calibration experiments we used the objective function described in eq 2 as the global calibration target and adjusted the searching ranges of some parameters in order for better calculation performance the weights assigned to catchments were set as identical four catchment observation sites campaspe barn campaspe roch murray swanhill and murray wakooljunct were selected to demonstrate the effects of hierarchical and global calibration fig 6 since campaspe barn and murray swanhill are upstream catchments of campaspe roch and murray wakooljunct respectively over calibration of these two upstream catchments results in poor effects of the calibration on downstream catchments fig 6 a d the global calibration is able to mitigate the deficiency as shown in the bottom row in fig 6 after the global calibration was executed the optimal objective function values of the upstream catchments increased comparing to those obtained by the hierarchical calibration the increase of the optimal objective function values means worse fitting effects between observed and simulated flow duration curves and this is also reflected in the graphical hydrographs however the concessions of fitting effects made by upstream catchments bring improvements in the calibration of downstream catchments the minimum objective function values for campaspe roch and murray wakooljunct are only 24 and 15 of those in the hierarchical calibration respectively visually the calibration effects of campaspe roch and murray wakooljunct are dramatically improved the minimum objective function value for the combined upstream and downstream catchments such as campaspe barn and campaspe roch was significantly improved in both cases 4 3 the two step calibration versus the semi automatic calibration the two step calibration framework with the clpso as the calibrator performs much better than the semi automatic calibration approach with excel solver see the ratio in eq 3 for each catchment shown in fig 4 although the solution accuracy of the solver on calibrating 4 in 57 catchments is superior to that of the two step calibration the average calibration performance ratio of the two step calibration to the semi automatic calibration over 57 catchments is 0 59 meaning that the two step calibration has approximately 40 improvement in flow duration curve calibration across all catchments 4 4 the clpso versus the sa under the two step calibration framework the solution accuracy of the sa is better than that of the solver but still worse than that of the clpso only 14 in 57 catchments calibrated by the sa perform better than those calibrated by the clpso fig 4 we have illustrated the superiority of the clpso calibrator in solution accuracy below we report the convergence characteristics of the clpso calibrator fig 7 presents the means and standard deviations of difference ratios see equation 5 over 57 catchments in the clpso calibrator the maximum number of ffes equals the product of population size n of swarm s and the total number of iterations generations as ffe equals 40 000 the average difference ratio which shows the average difference between the current best fitness value and final best fitness value is 1 26 when ffe is 60000 the ratio is only 0 27 this value demonstrates the calibration effect with 60 000 ffes is good enough since the remaining 20 000 ffe efforts only improve less than 0 3 the standard deviation continuously decreases with values 2 59 at 40 000 ffe and 0 96 at 60 000 ffe the dynamics of the standard deviations indicates the convergence of the clpso is stable the convergence performance of the clpso was also compared to the sa calibrator fig 7 at the initial 15 000 ffes the sa calibrator shows good convergence capability and the average difference ratios obtained from it are well below those obtained from the clpso after that the persistent convergence of the clpso calibrator leads to lower difference ratios relative to those in the sa case the standard deviations of difference ratios obtained by the sa calibrator are greater indicating that in terms of the convergence stability robustness the clpso is superior to the sa 5 discussion 5 1 effectiveness of the two step calibration solution it is difficult to effectively calibrate a basin scale hydrological model with complex model structure non linear component interactions and a substantial number of model parameters 5 57 285 in our case we have presented a hierarchical global calibration approach that performs calibration from upstream catchments to downstream ones and fine tunes the hierarchical calibration results we have shown that the hierarchical calibration has very good performance on flow duration curve calibration this calibration procedure based on flow duration curve also provided good calibration performance and acceptable prediction ability for time series flows hydrographs the global calibration procedure offers an opportunity to adjust the results from the hierarchical calibration based on specific needs the example provided in section 4 2 demonstrated that the calibration performance for downstream catchments could be significantly improved in the global calibration process by sacrificing some performance for upstream catchments the hierarchical calibration used a divide and conquer approach to reduce computation demands and maintain spatial coherence the hierarchical calibration results can be further tailored to a specific application based on user or expert information in the global calibration process and expert knowledge can be incorporated to reduce uncertainty the intended applications of the calibrated model are in exploring water allocation strategies and thus fitting quality in high flows is emphasised towards this end we focused on calibrating flow duration curves and chosen a measure of distance between ranked simulated and observed monthly flows the two step calibration framework with the clpso as the calibrator led to very good calibration performance in 47 of the total 57 calibrated catchments based on the indicators of nse rsr and pbias table 3 with additional five catchments being evaluated as good and four being measured as satisfactory the catchment warrego fordsbridge was the only exception that was evaluated as unsatisfactory due to a relative high mismatch in high flows both the visual calibration fig 4 and validation fig 5 results from the calibration framework indicate that the calibrated model is qualified for our intended purpose of water resources prediction and allocation 5 2 comparing the two step calibration with existing calibration approaches the two step calibration is an automatic calibration framework allowing for a fast and flexible way to produce very skillful model simulations in practice many water accounting models are still manually calibrated however manual calibration is much slower and to obtain satisfactory calibration performance greatly depends on the knowledge and experience of the modeller the automatic calibration framework allows for the accommodation of different calibrators and supports a parallel processing mode the selection of a better calibrator can further improve the efficiency of the calibration framework the calibration of a large scale such as basin scale water accounting model is often conducted either manually or automatically on each component such as catchment gauge or reach of the basin system separately some work e g ajami et al 2004 considered little on fluxes from outside of the component within the system when these calibrated individual components are linked together and work as a whole system omitted fluxes from upstream components will influence the downstream behaviours result in inconsistencies and propagate simulation errors across all downstream components hughes et al 2016 the other work e g hughes et al 2014 considered rive network calibration as opposed to the above isolated component calibration where simulated fluxes from the upstream components were then used to calibrate the next downstream components however these studies implicitly set higher priorities to upstream components without any system level adjustment in this way the calibrated parameters might be physically meaningless violate calibration criteria for the whole river system or suffer from the over fitting especially where observations were erroneous meanwhile these work lacked of a parallel mechanism to support efficient automatic calibration the proposed framework can effectively reduce spatial error propagation and calibrate model parameters in an efficient and systematic fashion compared with the semi automatic calibration using the microsoft office excel solver to conduct catchment by catchment calibration of model parameters within each catchment the two step calibration using the clpso has improved 40 in flow duration curve calculation and is more accurate in 93 of 57 catchments the framework is able to avoid dealing with highly dimensional and many objective calibration tasks with the rise of the number of parameters to be optimised finding the optimum is increasingly difficult for calibrators and the computational load increases exponentially especially where the calibration space is rough and multimodal in this case study applying a system wide calibration to simultaneously deal with the calibration problem with 285 5 57 parameters and goodness of fits of 57 catchments is difficult and computationally expensive while the two step calibration presents a hierarchical way to reduce the computational cost and then manages the tradeoffs of all components goodness of fits in terms of expert knowledge or model predictive needs 5 3 calibration performance of the clpso effectiveness efficiency and robustness are three significant aspects to evaluate calibration performance and compare different calibrators gao and hailu 2010 the clpso outperformed the sa in solution accuracy in 75 of the modelled catchments the mean and standard deviation trends of difference ratios fig 7 reflect superiority of the clpso to the sa in calibration efficiency and robustness the clpso improved standard pso in enabling all searching particles to learn from good particles and to largely avoid low efficient exploration of poor directions this improvement gives the clpso an outstanding capability of dealing with complex multimodal problems the calibration results and comparisons with the sa demonstrate that the clpso can improve calibration performance with regard to effectiveness efficiency and robustness a global sensitivity analysis gao and bryan 2016 gao et al 2016 saltelli et al 2008 is recommended to help modellers to screen out non influential parameters so that the calibration performance can be further improved by reducing the number of model parameters to be calibrated 5 4 limitations and future directions there are a number of limitations and possibilities for further investigation with respect to improve the calibration of the mdb water accounting model hydrologic model predictability is subject to not only the calibration method itself but also the availability and quality of observation data used for calibration our step wise calibration approach is applicable to hydrologic models built for managed or working rivers which are comprehensively gauged there are many examples of such rivers throughout the world and therefore many relevant applications for our approach for other rivers that have insufficient streamflow gauge stations spatially distributed remotely sensed data such as the evapotranspiration et data from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis can be used as an effective data resource for the calibration of hydrologic models for example rajib et al 2018 improved hydrologic model predictability by calibrating 29 sub basins separately with 29 representative time series of modis et one for each sub basin and only one time series of streamflow data from the outlet of the basin additionally through the calibration process uncertainty in the calibration data is converted into uncertainty in the estimated model parameters and other inferred quantities our future work includes the integration of bayesian inference schemes peeters et al 2018 renard et al 2010 into the proposed step wise calibration framework allowing the quantification of this derived parametric uncertainty multi objective optimisation methods gao et al 2014 marler and arora 2004 are increasingly used in the calibration of hydrological models bekele and nicklow 2007 rajib et al 2016 to produce a pareto set of optimal parameters in regard to several calibration objectives what we would like to explore in the future is incorporating pareto dominance into the clpso in order to allow this calibrator to handle calibration with several objective functions for example in the case study model multiple objectives to be calibrated include flow duration curves time series flows and diversions one major difficulty regarding the calibration of the water accounting model is the expensive computational demands therefore one aspect that we would like to investigate is translating the model from microsoft excel vba macro to other languages such as python and utilising high performance computing technologies bryan 2013 6 conclusions whole of basin hydrological models are needed to better manage the great river basins of the world which are threatened by a range of processes including climate change over extraction and declines in water quality and flows best 2019 bryan et al 2018 however the lack of an effective means of calibrating these complex many parameter hydrological models has potentially restricted their development and application we developed a new and effective calibration framework to improve the simulation accuracy of basin scale hydrological models it involves a hierarchical global calibration strategy aiming at effectively estimating a large number of model parameters and balancing trade offs among objective functions for all catchments the strategy includes a parallel processing algorithm to enable fast calibration for the hierarchical calibration and expert knowledge is usually required to facilitate the global adjustment of calibration outcomes considering excellent performance of locating global optima we implemented the clpso as a main calibrator in this framework although other methods could also be used several calibration experiments were conducted in order to examine the effects of the two step clpso calibration tool the visual and quantitative calibration effects indicated that the calibration tool could lead to satisfactory model outcomes with sufficient accuracy for the model s intended purpose the calibrated tool was also able to accurately simulate and predict time series flows global calibration significantly improved the calibration results obtained by the hierarchical calibration this work offers a useful tool for calibrating complex whole of basin hydrological models and reduces a significant barrier to the more widespread development of large scale river basin modelling to support the better management of the

5936,tunnel construction offers unique insights into the interior structure of rock massifs soluble rocks encountered during tunnel construction however pose a substantial challenge especially classical karst rocks such as limestone dolostone gypsum and anhydrite are unpredictable during tunnel excavation the enlarged voids created by the long term dissolution of the soluble rocks in contact with water pose risks because of possible uncontrollable water inflow and of instability of the encountered cave voids which often requires expensive remediation measures we model the long term development of karst features and the evolution of phreatic and epi phreatic caves below the schalkau plateau in the triassic limestone with a numerical karst evolution model with hydrological boundary conditions derived from local meteorological data and karst springs and a simplified model of the local lithology our model predicts the increase in secondary permeability in the karst aquifer enlarged fracture zones develop at locations where cave systems have been explored thus our long term evolution model can successfully predict karst features in the schalkau plateau applying the karst evolution model on a short term period we assess the effect of consolidation measures taken to stabilise the tunnel cross section in vicinity of the ble√überg cave and its longer term stability our model results suggest that flow through the cave section beneath the tunnel which has been filled with concrete and blocks is blocked and that during flood events the impounded water will accelerate the development of by passes around the artificial infill keywords soluble rocks karst tunnel construction karst related hazards numerical modelling ble√überg cave and tunnel 1 introduction drilling a tunnel through rock provides unique insights into the setup of the regional geology as the surface mapping is complemented by a third dimension in depth however the excavation of a tunnel also poses an engineering challenge because of the unknown state of the rock in front of the tunnel head if the tunnel is drilled through soluble rocks such as limestone dolostone gypsum or anhydrite the challenges become even bigger the soluble rock by its nature when traversed by water can be dissolved along bedding planes fractures and faults enhancing the initial primary permeability often by several orders of magnitude often fractures are enlarged to the meter size providing effective preferential flow paths for groundwater the enlarged void spaces pose a multi fold risk for tunnel excavation e g i uncontrolled water inflow through tapped pressurised fractures or from active yet unknown cavities and caves ii mechanical instability of the void space and its surrounding rock iii swelling of rocks e g anhydrite or anhydrite bearing rocks due to exposure to water or water vapor iv loss of ground contact for tunneling machines we highlight the complications from drilling tunnels through soluble rocks with several literature examples linaric 2010 compared forecasted and found karst features during the construction of tunnels in croatia and concluded that often the risk of karst structures is under estimated in tunnel construction and therefore responsible for a considerable increase in costs kielbassa et al 2015 reported on investigations of karst structures ahead of the railway construction along the german high speed railway line ulm wendlingen which crosses in large parts the jurassic limestones of the swabian alb weisser jura in parts through sediments of the alpine molasse especially the jurassic limestone of the swabian alb is heavily karstified the high speed line runs for almost 50 of the track through tunnels with a combination of geophysical surveys mainly reflection and refraction seismics and gravimetry and geological mapping the area under consideration has been investigated and from these direct and indirect methods an indicator for karstification has been derived to guide construction areas with a high probability of karst features have then been probed by boreholes most of the encountered cave voids in the meter size have then been filled by concrete or a mixture of blocks and concrete the authors stated that more karst voids have been discovered when compared to the forecast model along the same track prins et al 2019 have extended the geophysical field work with electric resistivity imaging along the railway track and were able to identify more shallow karst structures such as paleo sinkholes jeannin et al 2015 and malard et al 2015 discussed a highway tunnel within the jurassic limestone in switzerland which intersects flow towards a large karst spring the brunnm√ºhle spring using the karst alea approach filipponi et al 2012 they predicted the effect of large discharge events of the karst system connected to the brunnm√ºhle spring and proposed a monitoring system able to predict serious flooding in the area and the possible need to close or evacuate the tunnel while the karstalea approach is based on substantial information on the lithology faults and cavities yang 2016 has used a statistical approach to predict flood risk in tunnels through karst regions li et al 2014 follow a similar approach using fuzzy logics to describe six potential risks e g groundwater level geology lithology topography dip monitoring and derive a predictive measure of water inflow into tunnels through karst rocks in this paper we discuss a possible scenario of the development of karst features and active caves in the schalkau plateau in southern thuringia germany the region is traversed by the high speed railway line berlin munich and during the construction of the 8 3 km long ble√überg tunnel along its southern end the ble√überg cave was discovered the ble√überg tunnel traverses insoluble ordovician quarzite and shale along the majority of its length and crosses a major fault zone the frankonian line along its southern part south of the fault the tunnel passes through triassic limestones and here the ble√überg cave became a major obstacle during construction parts of the cave have been filled with debris and concrete to provide a stable base for the tunnel however as the ble√überg cave is an active river cave flow of the cave stream has been dammed we will use a numerical tool to discuss the evolution of karst features mainly cave systems in the schalkau plateau we therefore continue our successful application of our karst evolution modelling to real world scenarios e g hiller et al 2012 kaufmann et al 2018 kaufmann and romanov 2019 we apply the karst modelling approach to the long term natural evolution driven by the special boundary condition with aggressive water coming from runoff on the insoluble ordovician quarzite and shale sinking into the triassic limestones along the frankonian line and enforcing the evolution of secondary permeability in the soluble rock we then use a simple setup to simulate the limestone block directly around the ble√überg cave to investigate the short term anthropogenic evolution of blocking the active cave stream with blocks and concrete as it has been done during tunnel construction to stabilise the tunnel void our objectives are twofold i we compare the predicted enlarged preferential flow paths in the limestone to known and mapped caves in the region ii we speculate on the time frame during which new enlarged flow paths develop around the dammed part of the cave 2 geographical and geological setting in this section we provide a short overview describing the location of the schalkauer platte the triassic limestone plateau in southern thuringia with its known caves and karst features for more detailed information see knolle 2014 a topographical overview map of the region of interest is shown in fig 1 our study area is located south of the thuringian slate mountains a mountaineous region in central germany with elevations just close to 1000 m in the northern part not shown on the map in the south hills are around 800 900 m high e g silberberg ble√überg the thuringian slate mountains are mainly composed of paleozoic rocks along the frankonian line a large reverse fault with fault offsets reaching 1 km e g reicherter et al 2008 triassic rocks crop out in the south one example is the schalkau plateau schalkauer platte where the triassic limestone of the mittlerer middle mm and oberer upper mo muschelkalk are exposed and in parts the underlying triassic buntsandstein so formation acting as local aquitard fig 2 the schalkau plateau is located in elevations between 400 500 m and is approximatey 12x4 km in size the high speed railway line berlin munich crosses the area in parts through long tunnels e g silberberg tunnel 7407 4 m ble√überg tunnel 8325 8 m see fig 1 in fig 2 topography and geology is shown for the area of the schalkau plateau from the north several creeks drain the thuringian slate mountains region in our area of interest the creeks neundorfer grund the truckenthaler grund the gr√ºmpen the ru√übach and the retschenbach the creeks are flowing year round carrying water undersaturated with respect to calcium across the frankonian line once creeks cross the fault they recharge the triassic limestone of the schalkau plateau this soluble rock with fractures resulting from several uplift phases in the past provides a karst aquifer with its secondary permeability enlarged during time thus the creek beds are often dry in summer as the surface water disappears into sinks just south of the frankonian line several large cave systems have been explored and mapped in the triassic limestone of the schalkau plateau mainly in the lower muschelkalk formation mu which is located just above the upper buntsandstein formation so the r√∂t formation mainly shale in the upper buntsandstein is often impermeable acting as local watertable with several resurgences located along the boundary lower muschelkalk upper buntsandstein see cross section in fig 2 2 1 rauensteiner cave the rauensteiner cave fig 3 is an active cave system e g weiss 2014 rc in figures with around 1 6 km of explored cave passages the cave is located underneath the village of rauenstein water arrives from the north via a sink through the gr√ºmpen creek which looses its water almost completely in summer just north once its crosses the frankonian line most parts of the cave are developed along the water table or slightly below passages are sometimes sizeable from 4x4 up to 6x6 m but often are developed along bedding planes which are only about 0 5 1 m height along its southern end the water disappears into a syphon the water re appears in the neighboring triebischsystem tracing revealed a flow velocity of around 60 m h 2 2 triebischsystem the triebischsystem fig 3 has mapped cave passages just below 1 km length e g ellrich 2014a ts in figures it is located just south of the rauensteiner cave and it is hydraulically connected to this cave most of this active cave system is below the current water table and has been explored by diving typical phreatic conduits have meter size dimensions water flowing through the triebischsystem originates from both the creek gr√ºmpen via the rauensteiner cave and the smaller tributary ru√übach also draining the thuringian slate mountains with its insoluble rocks and disappearing underground in the village rauenstein in the ru√übach creek bed new sinkholes appear regularly e g in 2006 ellrich 2014a 2 3 zinsel cave the zinsel cave fig 3 is an active river cave about 250 m long e g fehn 2014 zc in figures the cave located directly south of the frankonian line receives water from the thuringian slate mountains via the creek retschenbach again undersaturated with respect to calcium access to the cave is via an old collapsed sinkhole which gives access to the river passage this river passage is mainly a vadose canyon about 1 1 5 m wide and 2 4 meters high with two small tributaries along its way in the southern part the water disappears into small fissures which guide the water towards a karst resurgence just south fehn 2014 2 4 ble√überg cave the ble√überg cave fig 3 with about 1 3 km of mapped cave passages leonhardt 2014b weiss and novak 2014 fohlert 2014 ellrich 2014b leonhardt 2014a m√∂ller et al 2014 bc in figures has been discovered during the construction of the high speed railway tunnel in 2008 the ble√überg tunnel during the excavation work the western part of the ble√überg cave was hit first and almost directly filled with concrete as the cave was larger than expected cavers were called in and explored parts of the western passage under serious time constraints moving down the artificial pile of debris and concrete they arrived at a lake whose water level was rising with 10 cm h obviously because of the artificial infill of the cave from the tunnel head after exploration access to the cave was completely sealed with concrete a few days later excavation of the tunnel hit the eastern part of the ble√überg cave again cavers were called in this time to explore and map the cave passages as it was realised that the ble√überg cave was a major cave system the western part of the ble√überg cave was opened again in early 2009 with a new access tunnel for further exploration during the exploration cavers mapped lake level fluctuations of around 10 m identified from the presence of high water marks remnants of construction material of the tunnel excavation the access to both cave parts was then closed finally in february 2009 today the western part of the ble√überg cave is accessible through an artificial shaft in the far west of the cave dug by the cavers the passages in the ble√überg cave are mainly enlarged fractures with typical widths of around 3 5 m and typical heights of around 5 10 m th√ºringer h√∂hlenverein 2008 the western parts comprise a main passage which splits into a northern and a southern passage about halfway into the cave both passages are active with cave creeks directly accessible and in parts under thick speleothem ledges drainage direction is towards the east the tunnel close to the railway tunnel the creek has been interrupted by the artificial infill the infill starts with a filter layer which should carry the water arriving from the west below the tunnel towards the unknown downstream direction above this filter layer the cave has been filled with blocks from the tunnel excavation this block pile is sealed with concrete to stabilise the tunnel segment the filter section along the bottom part is unable to carry all water during medium to high flow conditions and therefore a large lake is present in parts 10 m deep increasing the hydraulic gradient significantly the eastern part is less active and almost entirely covered by speleothems it seems that this eastern part is another tributary as flow directions are in westerly direction however the changes in cave morphology due to the tunneling work make it difficult to judge directly beneath the tunnel a large shaft zone is present which might collect the incoming water from the western and eastern passages it is not clear if the water is carried away along the passage towards the south along the tunnel axis however close to the southern exit of the ble√überg tunnel a smaller cave the ble√überg cave 2 has been found during the tunnel excavation showing that enlarged passages are present in the southern direction we have described the karst features of the schalkau plateau along with its mapped caves we can group the caves into three types i caves starting from the frankonian line as contact karst caves with vadose streams an example is the zinsel cave originating from the frankonian line the upper hydrogeological boundary of the karst aquifer and running perpendicular to the fault ii caves close to the water table developed as typical network caves in the epi phreatic and phreatic parts both the rauensteiner cave and the triebischsystem are such systems developed close to the base level in this case the creeks gr√ºmpen und ru√übach the karst springs are located along the lithological boundary lower muschelkalk limestone to upper buntsandstein shales iii caves along faults as vadose branchwork caves the example here is the ble√überg cave an active river cave following the frankonian line we will use this information in the next sections to set up an evolution model for the schalkau plateau 3 model in this section we provide a short overview on the modelling concept implemented and then assemble the boundary conditions needed 3 1 karst evolution model we set up a karst evolution model for the region using the socks3d package kaufmann and romanov 2019 which is a new fork of our widely used karstaquifer package see kaufmann et al 2010 hiller et al 2011 kaufmann et al 2012 hiller et al 2014 for more details the socks3d package can account for different soluble rock types and their interaction see for example kaufmann and romanov 2019 as the model description has been published elsewhere in more detail we provide only a brief review the program socks3d soluble rocks solves the following set of equations in a three dimensional modeling domain for a porous fractured aquifer under steady state or transient flow conditions with finite elements 1 s s h t q q c p a f c d t m rock œÅ rock f c the first equation is a conservation equation for flow with h m the hydraulic head q m s the darcy velocity s s 1 m the specific storage 1 m the nabla operator and t s time the second equation is the transport equation for the calcium concentration c mol m3 with p œÄ d m and a œÄ d 2 4 m2 the perimeter and the cross section of a circular fracture representing fractures and bedding partings in the system d m the fracture diameter f mol m2 s the calcium flux rate and c mol m3 the calcium concentration the third equation describes the reactive enlargement of a fracture with m rock kg mol the atomic mass and œÅ rock kg m3 the density of the soluble rock darcy velocity is given by 2 q k h with k m s the hydraulic conductivity note that flux rates f for limestone are non linear and that flow can be either laminar or turbulent see kaufmann and romanov 2019 for more details 3 2 boundary conditions next we assemble the information needed for our karst evolution models the schalkau plateau receives a considerable inflow from the thuringian slate mountains the region north of the frankonian line composed of insoluble rocks ordovician quarzites and shales we have estimated the relative runoff from this region with a landscape evolution model kaufmann et al 2016 by balancing precipitation and evapotranspiration and tracing the surface water along the surface of the model to obtain an order of magnitude estimate for the inflow in the karst evolution model the resulting annual relative runoff is shown in fig 4 for most of the region north of the frankonian line the relative runoff is one which describes a grid cell as only receiving precipitation but no runoff from upstream nodes along the valleys of the thuringian slate mountains relative runoff is about 500 2000 times higher as the water running down the surface is channeled towards the valleys clearly visible in the runoff map are the three valleys of the creeks truckenthaler grund the gr√ºmpen and the ru√übach we estimate the annual precipitation from a nearby weather station in the village sonneberg www climate data org location see fig 1 this village receives an annual precipitation of 650 mm yr and the average temperature is around 7 7 c this conditions have been fairly stable during the holocene just the vegetation density has changed from more open to denser forest and increasing forest cover in the late holocene breitenbach et al 2019 using a simple model for evapo transpiration which is driven by surface temperature h√∂lting 1984 we arrive at a typical annual runoff of around 230 mm yr reaching the surface of the karst aquifer both the surface runoff from the thuringian slate mountains north of the frankonian line and the local precipitation are assumed to have a calcium concentration c lower than the calcium equilibrium concentration c eq we assume that the runoff from the thuringian slate mountains has an elevated carbon dioxide pressure of around p co 2 runoff 20000 ppm resulting from the vegetation cover the precipitation however has only atmospheric carbon dioxide dissolved thus p co 2 rain 400 ppm for the annual air temperature of the model region we assume the value taken from the sonneberg station t 8 c using an analytical expression for the calculation of the calcium equilibrium concentration for a closed system with no exchange of carbon dioxide with the atmosphere dreybrodt 1988 we arrive at the following values based on the temperature t 8 p co 2 c eq 0 9 c eq ppm mol m3 mol m3 rain 400 0 02 0 018 runoff 20000 1 07 0 96 in the last column we report the 90 saturation value of the water with respect to calcium which marks for limestone the switch from linear to non linear kinetics for the runoff from the thuringian slate mountains we assume that the water has reached this 90 threshold already north of the frankonian line thus c runoff 0 9 c eq with this assumption we take into account that from the ordovizian catchment surface runoff has already dissolved some calcium for the precipitation we assume that once the water has passed the vadose zone it is saturated with respect to calcium thus c rain c eq with the boundary conditions defined we move now to the results section 4 results in this section we will start with a large scale model of the entire area around the ble√überg and rauensteiner caves and the triebischsystem which is used to estimate the past evolution of karstification in the schalkau plateau with a special focus on the known and mapped cave sites with this long term evolution we want to address the distribution of caves in the area discuss their relation to hydraulic boundary conditions and provide an explanation why an active cave could have been expected close to the tunneling site a second small scale model with higher resolution is focussing on the vicinity of the ble√überg cave and aims to look at the future evolution of the area dammed by concrete and blocks during the construction of the tunnel here we want to estimate the development of secondary permeability and the associated fracture enlargement around the obstruction as the ongoing dissolution around the blocked area might destabilise the tunnel segment above the blocked part of the ble√überg cave 4 1 large scale model past the horizontal model outline for the large scale model is shown in fig 4 as white dashed line an area 2x4 km in size it is discretised into 201x101 nodal points in horizontal directions and 21 nodes vertically this resolution results in 400 000 matrix elements and 1 250 000 fracture elements with a discretisation of 20 m in horizontal and 5 m in vertical direction time steps used are between one and ten years note that we assign different material properties for the ordovizian quarzites and shale the buntsandstein and the soluble muschelkalk the initial setup is shown in fig 5 as the socks3d model calculates flow transport and dissolution in a three dimensional aquifer which comprises both matrix and fracture elements we need to assign hydraulic conductivities and storativities for both components for the matrix we use k m 10 9 m s as hydraulic conductivity and s m 5 10 6 1 m as specific storativity with this choice the matrix does not play a significant role in the evolution model thus our lack of knowledge about precise values for the matrix properties of the different rock types is not crucial for the models for the fractures we distinguish between fractures in the ordovician quarzite and shale and the roet buntsandstein formation with mean fracture diameters of d Œº 1 mm and being insoluble thus no fracture enlargement and in the muschelkalk with initial fracture diameters of d Œº 1 mm but enlargable by chemical dissolution both fracture widths are perturbed statistically by a log normal distribution with a standard deviation of d œÉ 5 10 5 m the specific storativity of the fractures is low s f 10 8 1 m these values are based on previous modelling exercises and result in a groundwater distribution within the range expected for an initial state of the model with the water table being close to the surface flow through the aquifer is driven by the hydraulic gradient with the three perennial creeks truckenthaler grund gr√ºmpen and ru√übach arriving from the north and the annual precipitation as inflow and the resurgences along the stratigraphic interface muschelkalk buntsandstein as karst springs lochquelle truckenthal 452 5 m lochquellen t5 and t7 448 5 and 439 2 m as we are interested in the early long term evolution we model the incoming rivers as fixed head boundary condition to mimic hydraulic control the frankonian line separating the insoluble ordovizian quarzite and shale from the triassic limestone is visible in the back part of the sub surface the resulting hydraulic head distribution is shown in fig 5 contoured pressure lines reveal the largest gradient between the ru√übach and the defined karst springs both the gr√ºmpen and the truckenthaler grund which actually carry more water across the frankonian line induce less pronounced hydraulic gradients the reason for this distribution is the location of the valleys across the frankonian line here the ru√übach runs at the highest elevation the other two creeks at other elevations resulting in different hydraulic gradients note that in the early phase of karstification this strong hydraulic gradient is kept as the allogenic water from the thuringian slate mountains running in catchments composed of insoluble rocks keeps the runoff high in the model setup fig 5 we have also marked very simple cave geometries for the three systems ble√überg cave rauensteiner cave and triebischsystem here large caves have been explored linear in structure for the first and more complex networks for the two latter caves a successful evolution model aims to explain these karst features as prominent flow pathes next we explore the evolved fracture distribution in the muschelkalk we present two snapshots in time fig 6 for the model 2 500 years into the evolution fractures in the muschelkalk are enlarged close to the areas where the three creeks cross the frankonian line here the large hydraulic gradient of the ru√übach has initiated a sequence of enlarged fractures in the 2 5 cm range thus at least an order of magnitude larger than the initial values for the fractures from the gr√ºmpen another set of enlarged fractures grows along the frankonian line towards the east similarly the aggressive water from the truckenthaler grund is responsible for another cluster of enlarged fractures along the frankonian line further west all these enlarged clusters along the frankonian line are a result of the different hydraulic gradients induced from water of the incoming valleys note however that some clusters of enlarged fractures already start growing towards the local karst springs initiating a second direction of enlargement 10 000 years into the evolution the situation has evolved further while the clusters along the frankonian line have continued growing their growth has slowed down because the hydraulic pressure gradient becomes more pronounced in the flow directions towards the watertable we now observe clusters of enlarged fractures in the lower gr√ºmpen and ru√übach valleys with prominent flow pathes enlarged to the 10 cm size and more at the locations of the rauensteiner cave and the triebischsystem these enlarged clusters also occupy the sub surface below the part of the creeks running over the soluble muschelkalk this pattern can explain the numerous sinkholes in the creek valleys south of the frankonian line marking the infiltration of the surface water into the sub surface with no surface flow during the summer months a cluster of enlarged fractures also evolved at the location of the ble√überg cave however the sizes of the dissolutionally enlarged fractures are small when compared to the locations of the rauensteiner cave and the triebischsystem for the large ble√überg cave we want to predict a more prominent growth of fractures at this cave location we therefore add another boundary condition and inject water along the frankonian line in the western part of the evolving ble√überg cave our assumption here is that part of the drainage from the thuringian slate mountains is channeled along the prominent fault into an west eastern direction as proposed in the literature e g th√ºringer h√∂hlenverein 2008 in fig 7 we present such a model which assumes a local inflow of water along the fault zone in the sub surface which arrives at the fault with a calcium concentration of c fault 0 9 c eq this additional inflow results in a more prominent cluster of enlarged fractures around the location of the ble√überg cave which enlarged passages evolving towards the south the location of the small ble√überg cave 2 and the local spring note that we terminated the model 10 000 years into the evolution because the evolved preferential flow system is mature enough now to swallow all incoming water across the frankonian line if we would continue the model runs we would change the boundary conditions to an inflow condition for the three creeks will lower the hydraulic gradient in the triassic muschelkalk significantly the result would be a slower evolution from this time on with dissolution mainly focussed to the already enlarged zones as a consequence the 10 cm size conduits around the localities of the rauensteiner cave the triebischsystem and the ble√überg cave will grow in size we stress that we do not expect more information from continuing the model run with fixed inflow condition except when a reorganisation of the system e g valley incision tectonic uplift would occur we however have no evidence of such an event 4 2 small scale model future we proceed with a small scale model of the vicinity of the ble√überg cave which we will use to investigate the effect of blocking flow through the cave resulting from the remediation measures during the tunnel construction phase we extract a block 100 by 50 m in size and 50 m thick shown in fig 4 as white dotted line and discretise it into 101x51 nodes in horizontal and 51 nodes in vertical direction resulting in a resolution of 1 m fig 8 the block is centered around the part of the ble√überg tunnel cutting the ble√überg cave the area around the white tunnel in fig 2 while the initial fracture distribution is assigned with a mean of d Œº 1 mm and a standard deviation of d œÉ 0 05 mm for the log normal distribution the ble√überg cave is modelled as single conduit with a diameter of 2 m red conduits the ble√überg cave conduit in the model is interrupted over 15 m distance grey semi transparent area below the tunnel black wireframe and fractures are reduced to a size of 1 mm and marked as insoluble this 15 m long stretch marks the cross section of the tunnel 8 23 m height and 13 64 m width with the cave with the artificial infill of blocks and concrete to stabilise the tunnel the size of the blocked area perpendicular to the cave is 8 m wide stretching from the tunnel floor 12 m vertically into the area where the ble√überg cave crosses the tunnel note that the downstream end of the small scale model mimics flow out of the ble√überg cave which as we stated earlier is likely towards the south the end of the railway tunnel we set up two models each running for 300 years into the future to discuss the impact of different boundary conditions note that our time scale strongly depends on the boundary conditions chosen such as the hydraulic head difference and the chemistry of the cave creek ponding in front of the obstructed flow path also we can only roughly estimate the permeability around the blocked area with our model we provide a very conservative estimate as both the hydraulic head and the initial fracture distribution are taken as lower bounds first model for the first model two snapshots in time are shown in fig 9 as inflow condition we impose a fixed hydraulic head of 490 5 m on the western left side on the outflow side on the east right a fixed head of 490 m drains the system thus the pressure drop along the 100 m passage is 50 cm representing a low hydraulic gradient of 0 005 incoming water is undersaturated with respect to calcium c cave 0 9 c eq using a temperature of t 8 c and a carbon dioxide pressure of p 20000 ppm which is similar to the values chosen for the long term model as no present day measurements are available the interrupted flow path of the ble√überg cave is clearly visible not only geometrically but also in the hydraulic head contours which are pushed together across the blocked part of the cave during the evolution a classical breakthrough scenario occurs pressure lines move to the right until a flow path is established between the western and the eastern part of the blocked part of the ble√überg cave then this flow path is further enlarged and widened 200 years into the evolution several enlarged clusters of fractures try to by pass the blocked area on all sides 300 years into the evolution all clusters with fractures larger than 2 cm connect to the eastern side of the cave thus a dense mesh of dissolutionally enlarged fractures has been established which replaces the former single cave passage now blocked however the size of the newly enlarged fractures is in the centimetre range even after 300 years for the shown example second model for the second model we assume that the restriction caused by the concrete infill causes water accumulation in the western part of the ble√überg cave to impound to a height of 2 m thus boundary conditions are a fixed head condition of 492 m in the entire western part of the cave and 490 m at the far east of the cave as before with this scenario we account for the reported back flooding of the cave results for this model are shown in fig 10 now pressure lines are much denser as the hydraulic gradient is larger 0 02 the evolution of secondary permeability with similar clusters evolving around and beneath the blocked zone occurs faster when compared to the first model we conclude that water flowing through the western part of the ble√überg cave will dissolve limestone and enlarge fractures around the concrete infill below the tunnel the time frame of this enlargement depends on several imposed boundary conditions among others the hydraulic head the chemistry of the incoming solution and the initial fracture distribution around the blocked area with our two scenarios we already achieved a difference in breakthrough time of 50 thus monitoring the hydro chemistry of the ble√überg cave is an important prerequisite for assessing the risk of tunnel damage induced by the ongoing dissolution of the muschelkalk 5 conclusions we have discussed the schalkau plateau an area made up of the limestones of the triassic muschelkalk which receives aggressive surface water from the thuringian slate mountains in the north across the large fault of the frankonian line several creeks carry water towards the limestone plateau and initiate dissolution on and in the limestone aquifer several caves are known and have been mapped which can be grouped into three types i vadose river caves originating on the fault zone and directed towards the watertable following the steepest hydraulic gradient ii epi phreatic and phreatic network caves developed close to the water table and draining the area through several resurgences iii the ble√überg cave developed in and along the fault plane of the frankonian line we have shown by numerical means that all cave types can be explained with a model driven by localised input of aggressive water from the creeks draining the ordovizian rocks of the thuringian slate mountains and discharging close to the base of the triassic muschelkalk formation our simplified numerical evolution model predicts the early karstification of the schalkau plateau the model results in enlarged karstified conduits in the regions where caves are found for the third group of caves namely the ble√überg cave we considered an additional influx of aggressive water along the frankonian line with a second set of models we explored the possible future evolution of the area of the ble√überg cave which has been blocked by the concrete infill below the ble√überg tunnel this high resolution model predicts a substantial enlargement of fractures around the blocked zone the maze like enlargement of fractures to the one to ten centimeter size around the former now blocked cave passage can pose a geomechanical risk to the tunnel stability which needs to be explored with mechanical modelling and thus is beyond the scope of this paper the time scale for the enlargement in our models 100 200 years however depends strongly on the hydraulic structural and chemical parameters chosen for the model we therefore suggest a monitoring system installed in the ble√überg cave logging stage temperature and water chemistry in the cave stream to provide a base for evaluating the future evolution below the tunnel our numerical model successfully predicts known and unknown cavities in the schalkau plateau and correlated karstification patterns we demonstrate that with available field data from the location and its geological history a meaningful numerical model can be

5936,tunnel construction offers unique insights into the interior structure of rock massifs soluble rocks encountered during tunnel construction however pose a substantial challenge especially classical karst rocks such as limestone dolostone gypsum and anhydrite are unpredictable during tunnel excavation the enlarged voids created by the long term dissolution of the soluble rocks in contact with water pose risks because of possible uncontrollable water inflow and of instability of the encountered cave voids which often requires expensive remediation measures we model the long term development of karst features and the evolution of phreatic and epi phreatic caves below the schalkau plateau in the triassic limestone with a numerical karst evolution model with hydrological boundary conditions derived from local meteorological data and karst springs and a simplified model of the local lithology our model predicts the increase in secondary permeability in the karst aquifer enlarged fracture zones develop at locations where cave systems have been explored thus our long term evolution model can successfully predict karst features in the schalkau plateau applying the karst evolution model on a short term period we assess the effect of consolidation measures taken to stabilise the tunnel cross section in vicinity of the ble√überg cave and its longer term stability our model results suggest that flow through the cave section beneath the tunnel which has been filled with concrete and blocks is blocked and that during flood events the impounded water will accelerate the development of by passes around the artificial infill keywords soluble rocks karst tunnel construction karst related hazards numerical modelling ble√überg cave and tunnel 1 introduction drilling a tunnel through rock provides unique insights into the setup of the regional geology as the surface mapping is complemented by a third dimension in depth however the excavation of a tunnel also poses an engineering challenge because of the unknown state of the rock in front of the tunnel head if the tunnel is drilled through soluble rocks such as limestone dolostone gypsum or anhydrite the challenges become even bigger the soluble rock by its nature when traversed by water can be dissolved along bedding planes fractures and faults enhancing the initial primary permeability often by several orders of magnitude often fractures are enlarged to the meter size providing effective preferential flow paths for groundwater the enlarged void spaces pose a multi fold risk for tunnel excavation e g i uncontrolled water inflow through tapped pressurised fractures or from active yet unknown cavities and caves ii mechanical instability of the void space and its surrounding rock iii swelling of rocks e g anhydrite or anhydrite bearing rocks due to exposure to water or water vapor iv loss of ground contact for tunneling machines we highlight the complications from drilling tunnels through soluble rocks with several literature examples linaric 2010 compared forecasted and found karst features during the construction of tunnels in croatia and concluded that often the risk of karst structures is under estimated in tunnel construction and therefore responsible for a considerable increase in costs kielbassa et al 2015 reported on investigations of karst structures ahead of the railway construction along the german high speed railway line ulm wendlingen which crosses in large parts the jurassic limestones of the swabian alb weisser jura in parts through sediments of the alpine molasse especially the jurassic limestone of the swabian alb is heavily karstified the high speed line runs for almost 50 of the track through tunnels with a combination of geophysical surveys mainly reflection and refraction seismics and gravimetry and geological mapping the area under consideration has been investigated and from these direct and indirect methods an indicator for karstification has been derived to guide construction areas with a high probability of karst features have then been probed by boreholes most of the encountered cave voids in the meter size have then been filled by concrete or a mixture of blocks and concrete the authors stated that more karst voids have been discovered when compared to the forecast model along the same track prins et al 2019 have extended the geophysical field work with electric resistivity imaging along the railway track and were able to identify more shallow karst structures such as paleo sinkholes jeannin et al 2015 and malard et al 2015 discussed a highway tunnel within the jurassic limestone in switzerland which intersects flow towards a large karst spring the brunnm√ºhle spring using the karst alea approach filipponi et al 2012 they predicted the effect of large discharge events of the karst system connected to the brunnm√ºhle spring and proposed a monitoring system able to predict serious flooding in the area and the possible need to close or evacuate the tunnel while the karstalea approach is based on substantial information on the lithology faults and cavities yang 2016 has used a statistical approach to predict flood risk in tunnels through karst regions li et al 2014 follow a similar approach using fuzzy logics to describe six potential risks e g groundwater level geology lithology topography dip monitoring and derive a predictive measure of water inflow into tunnels through karst rocks in this paper we discuss a possible scenario of the development of karst features and active caves in the schalkau plateau in southern thuringia germany the region is traversed by the high speed railway line berlin munich and during the construction of the 8 3 km long ble√überg tunnel along its southern end the ble√überg cave was discovered the ble√überg tunnel traverses insoluble ordovician quarzite and shale along the majority of its length and crosses a major fault zone the frankonian line along its southern part south of the fault the tunnel passes through triassic limestones and here the ble√überg cave became a major obstacle during construction parts of the cave have been filled with debris and concrete to provide a stable base for the tunnel however as the ble√überg cave is an active river cave flow of the cave stream has been dammed we will use a numerical tool to discuss the evolution of karst features mainly cave systems in the schalkau plateau we therefore continue our successful application of our karst evolution modelling to real world scenarios e g hiller et al 2012 kaufmann et al 2018 kaufmann and romanov 2019 we apply the karst modelling approach to the long term natural evolution driven by the special boundary condition with aggressive water coming from runoff on the insoluble ordovician quarzite and shale sinking into the triassic limestones along the frankonian line and enforcing the evolution of secondary permeability in the soluble rock we then use a simple setup to simulate the limestone block directly around the ble√überg cave to investigate the short term anthropogenic evolution of blocking the active cave stream with blocks and concrete as it has been done during tunnel construction to stabilise the tunnel void our objectives are twofold i we compare the predicted enlarged preferential flow paths in the limestone to known and mapped caves in the region ii we speculate on the time frame during which new enlarged flow paths develop around the dammed part of the cave 2 geographical and geological setting in this section we provide a short overview describing the location of the schalkauer platte the triassic limestone plateau in southern thuringia with its known caves and karst features for more detailed information see knolle 2014 a topographical overview map of the region of interest is shown in fig 1 our study area is located south of the thuringian slate mountains a mountaineous region in central germany with elevations just close to 1000 m in the northern part not shown on the map in the south hills are around 800 900 m high e g silberberg ble√überg the thuringian slate mountains are mainly composed of paleozoic rocks along the frankonian line a large reverse fault with fault offsets reaching 1 km e g reicherter et al 2008 triassic rocks crop out in the south one example is the schalkau plateau schalkauer platte where the triassic limestone of the mittlerer middle mm and oberer upper mo muschelkalk are exposed and in parts the underlying triassic buntsandstein so formation acting as local aquitard fig 2 the schalkau plateau is located in elevations between 400 500 m and is approximatey 12x4 km in size the high speed railway line berlin munich crosses the area in parts through long tunnels e g silberberg tunnel 7407 4 m ble√überg tunnel 8325 8 m see fig 1 in fig 2 topography and geology is shown for the area of the schalkau plateau from the north several creeks drain the thuringian slate mountains region in our area of interest the creeks neundorfer grund the truckenthaler grund the gr√ºmpen the ru√übach and the retschenbach the creeks are flowing year round carrying water undersaturated with respect to calcium across the frankonian line once creeks cross the fault they recharge the triassic limestone of the schalkau plateau this soluble rock with fractures resulting from several uplift phases in the past provides a karst aquifer with its secondary permeability enlarged during time thus the creek beds are often dry in summer as the surface water disappears into sinks just south of the frankonian line several large cave systems have been explored and mapped in the triassic limestone of the schalkau plateau mainly in the lower muschelkalk formation mu which is located just above the upper buntsandstein formation so the r√∂t formation mainly shale in the upper buntsandstein is often impermeable acting as local watertable with several resurgences located along the boundary lower muschelkalk upper buntsandstein see cross section in fig 2 2 1 rauensteiner cave the rauensteiner cave fig 3 is an active cave system e g weiss 2014 rc in figures with around 1 6 km of explored cave passages the cave is located underneath the village of rauenstein water arrives from the north via a sink through the gr√ºmpen creek which looses its water almost completely in summer just north once its crosses the frankonian line most parts of the cave are developed along the water table or slightly below passages are sometimes sizeable from 4x4 up to 6x6 m but often are developed along bedding planes which are only about 0 5 1 m height along its southern end the water disappears into a syphon the water re appears in the neighboring triebischsystem tracing revealed a flow velocity of around 60 m h 2 2 triebischsystem the triebischsystem fig 3 has mapped cave passages just below 1 km length e g ellrich 2014a ts in figures it is located just south of the rauensteiner cave and it is hydraulically connected to this cave most of this active cave system is below the current water table and has been explored by diving typical phreatic conduits have meter size dimensions water flowing through the triebischsystem originates from both the creek gr√ºmpen via the rauensteiner cave and the smaller tributary ru√übach also draining the thuringian slate mountains with its insoluble rocks and disappearing underground in the village rauenstein in the ru√übach creek bed new sinkholes appear regularly e g in 2006 ellrich 2014a 2 3 zinsel cave the zinsel cave fig 3 is an active river cave about 250 m long e g fehn 2014 zc in figures the cave located directly south of the frankonian line receives water from the thuringian slate mountains via the creek retschenbach again undersaturated with respect to calcium access to the cave is via an old collapsed sinkhole which gives access to the river passage this river passage is mainly a vadose canyon about 1 1 5 m wide and 2 4 meters high with two small tributaries along its way in the southern part the water disappears into small fissures which guide the water towards a karst resurgence just south fehn 2014 2 4 ble√überg cave the ble√überg cave fig 3 with about 1 3 km of mapped cave passages leonhardt 2014b weiss and novak 2014 fohlert 2014 ellrich 2014b leonhardt 2014a m√∂ller et al 2014 bc in figures has been discovered during the construction of the high speed railway tunnel in 2008 the ble√überg tunnel during the excavation work the western part of the ble√überg cave was hit first and almost directly filled with concrete as the cave was larger than expected cavers were called in and explored parts of the western passage under serious time constraints moving down the artificial pile of debris and concrete they arrived at a lake whose water level was rising with 10 cm h obviously because of the artificial infill of the cave from the tunnel head after exploration access to the cave was completely sealed with concrete a few days later excavation of the tunnel hit the eastern part of the ble√überg cave again cavers were called in this time to explore and map the cave passages as it was realised that the ble√überg cave was a major cave system the western part of the ble√überg cave was opened again in early 2009 with a new access tunnel for further exploration during the exploration cavers mapped lake level fluctuations of around 10 m identified from the presence of high water marks remnants of construction material of the tunnel excavation the access to both cave parts was then closed finally in february 2009 today the western part of the ble√überg cave is accessible through an artificial shaft in the far west of the cave dug by the cavers the passages in the ble√überg cave are mainly enlarged fractures with typical widths of around 3 5 m and typical heights of around 5 10 m th√ºringer h√∂hlenverein 2008 the western parts comprise a main passage which splits into a northern and a southern passage about halfway into the cave both passages are active with cave creeks directly accessible and in parts under thick speleothem ledges drainage direction is towards the east the tunnel close to the railway tunnel the creek has been interrupted by the artificial infill the infill starts with a filter layer which should carry the water arriving from the west below the tunnel towards the unknown downstream direction above this filter layer the cave has been filled with blocks from the tunnel excavation this block pile is sealed with concrete to stabilise the tunnel segment the filter section along the bottom part is unable to carry all water during medium to high flow conditions and therefore a large lake is present in parts 10 m deep increasing the hydraulic gradient significantly the eastern part is less active and almost entirely covered by speleothems it seems that this eastern part is another tributary as flow directions are in westerly direction however the changes in cave morphology due to the tunneling work make it difficult to judge directly beneath the tunnel a large shaft zone is present which might collect the incoming water from the western and eastern passages it is not clear if the water is carried away along the passage towards the south along the tunnel axis however close to the southern exit of the ble√überg tunnel a smaller cave the ble√überg cave 2 has been found during the tunnel excavation showing that enlarged passages are present in the southern direction we have described the karst features of the schalkau plateau along with its mapped caves we can group the caves into three types i caves starting from the frankonian line as contact karst caves with vadose streams an example is the zinsel cave originating from the frankonian line the upper hydrogeological boundary of the karst aquifer and running perpendicular to the fault ii caves close to the water table developed as typical network caves in the epi phreatic and phreatic parts both the rauensteiner cave and the triebischsystem are such systems developed close to the base level in this case the creeks gr√ºmpen und ru√übach the karst springs are located along the lithological boundary lower muschelkalk limestone to upper buntsandstein shales iii caves along faults as vadose branchwork caves the example here is the ble√überg cave an active river cave following the frankonian line we will use this information in the next sections to set up an evolution model for the schalkau plateau 3 model in this section we provide a short overview on the modelling concept implemented and then assemble the boundary conditions needed 3 1 karst evolution model we set up a karst evolution model for the region using the socks3d package kaufmann and romanov 2019 which is a new fork of our widely used karstaquifer package see kaufmann et al 2010 hiller et al 2011 kaufmann et al 2012 hiller et al 2014 for more details the socks3d package can account for different soluble rock types and their interaction see for example kaufmann and romanov 2019 as the model description has been published elsewhere in more detail we provide only a brief review the program socks3d soluble rocks solves the following set of equations in a three dimensional modeling domain for a porous fractured aquifer under steady state or transient flow conditions with finite elements 1 s s h t q q c p a f c d t m rock œÅ rock f c the first equation is a conservation equation for flow with h m the hydraulic head q m s the darcy velocity s s 1 m the specific storage 1 m the nabla operator and t s time the second equation is the transport equation for the calcium concentration c mol m3 with p œÄ d m and a œÄ d 2 4 m2 the perimeter and the cross section of a circular fracture representing fractures and bedding partings in the system d m the fracture diameter f mol m2 s the calcium flux rate and c mol m3 the calcium concentration the third equation describes the reactive enlargement of a fracture with m rock kg mol the atomic mass and œÅ rock kg m3 the density of the soluble rock darcy velocity is given by 2 q k h with k m s the hydraulic conductivity note that flux rates f for limestone are non linear and that flow can be either laminar or turbulent see kaufmann and romanov 2019 for more details 3 2 boundary conditions next we assemble the information needed for our karst evolution models the schalkau plateau receives a considerable inflow from the thuringian slate mountains the region north of the frankonian line composed of insoluble rocks ordovician quarzites and shales we have estimated the relative runoff from this region with a landscape evolution model kaufmann et al 2016 by balancing precipitation and evapotranspiration and tracing the surface water along the surface of the model to obtain an order of magnitude estimate for the inflow in the karst evolution model the resulting annual relative runoff is shown in fig 4 for most of the region north of the frankonian line the relative runoff is one which describes a grid cell as only receiving precipitation but no runoff from upstream nodes along the valleys of the thuringian slate mountains relative runoff is about 500 2000 times higher as the water running down the surface is channeled towards the valleys clearly visible in the runoff map are the three valleys of the creeks truckenthaler grund the gr√ºmpen and the ru√übach we estimate the annual precipitation from a nearby weather station in the village sonneberg www climate data org location see fig 1 this village receives an annual precipitation of 650 mm yr and the average temperature is around 7 7 c this conditions have been fairly stable during the holocene just the vegetation density has changed from more open to denser forest and increasing forest cover in the late holocene breitenbach et al 2019 using a simple model for evapo transpiration which is driven by surface temperature h√∂lting 1984 we arrive at a typical annual runoff of around 230 mm yr reaching the surface of the karst aquifer both the surface runoff from the thuringian slate mountains north of the frankonian line and the local precipitation are assumed to have a calcium concentration c lower than the calcium equilibrium concentration c eq we assume that the runoff from the thuringian slate mountains has an elevated carbon dioxide pressure of around p co 2 runoff 20000 ppm resulting from the vegetation cover the precipitation however has only atmospheric carbon dioxide dissolved thus p co 2 rain 400 ppm for the annual air temperature of the model region we assume the value taken from the sonneberg station t 8 c using an analytical expression for the calculation of the calcium equilibrium concentration for a closed system with no exchange of carbon dioxide with the atmosphere dreybrodt 1988 we arrive at the following values based on the temperature t 8 p co 2 c eq 0 9 c eq ppm mol m3 mol m3 rain 400 0 02 0 018 runoff 20000 1 07 0 96 in the last column we report the 90 saturation value of the water with respect to calcium which marks for limestone the switch from linear to non linear kinetics for the runoff from the thuringian slate mountains we assume that the water has reached this 90 threshold already north of the frankonian line thus c runoff 0 9 c eq with this assumption we take into account that from the ordovizian catchment surface runoff has already dissolved some calcium for the precipitation we assume that once the water has passed the vadose zone it is saturated with respect to calcium thus c rain c eq with the boundary conditions defined we move now to the results section 4 results in this section we will start with a large scale model of the entire area around the ble√überg and rauensteiner caves and the triebischsystem which is used to estimate the past evolution of karstification in the schalkau plateau with a special focus on the known and mapped cave sites with this long term evolution we want to address the distribution of caves in the area discuss their relation to hydraulic boundary conditions and provide an explanation why an active cave could have been expected close to the tunneling site a second small scale model with higher resolution is focussing on the vicinity of the ble√überg cave and aims to look at the future evolution of the area dammed by concrete and blocks during the construction of the tunnel here we want to estimate the development of secondary permeability and the associated fracture enlargement around the obstruction as the ongoing dissolution around the blocked area might destabilise the tunnel segment above the blocked part of the ble√überg cave 4 1 large scale model past the horizontal model outline for the large scale model is shown in fig 4 as white dashed line an area 2x4 km in size it is discretised into 201x101 nodal points in horizontal directions and 21 nodes vertically this resolution results in 400 000 matrix elements and 1 250 000 fracture elements with a discretisation of 20 m in horizontal and 5 m in vertical direction time steps used are between one and ten years note that we assign different material properties for the ordovizian quarzites and shale the buntsandstein and the soluble muschelkalk the initial setup is shown in fig 5 as the socks3d model calculates flow transport and dissolution in a three dimensional aquifer which comprises both matrix and fracture elements we need to assign hydraulic conductivities and storativities for both components for the matrix we use k m 10 9 m s as hydraulic conductivity and s m 5 10 6 1 m as specific storativity with this choice the matrix does not play a significant role in the evolution model thus our lack of knowledge about precise values for the matrix properties of the different rock types is not crucial for the models for the fractures we distinguish between fractures in the ordovician quarzite and shale and the roet buntsandstein formation with mean fracture diameters of d Œº 1 mm and being insoluble thus no fracture enlargement and in the muschelkalk with initial fracture diameters of d Œº 1 mm but enlargable by chemical dissolution both fracture widths are perturbed statistically by a log normal distribution with a standard deviation of d œÉ 5 10 5 m the specific storativity of the fractures is low s f 10 8 1 m these values are based on previous modelling exercises and result in a groundwater distribution within the range expected for an initial state of the model with the water table being close to the surface flow through the aquifer is driven by the hydraulic gradient with the three perennial creeks truckenthaler grund gr√ºmpen and ru√übach arriving from the north and the annual precipitation as inflow and the resurgences along the stratigraphic interface muschelkalk buntsandstein as karst springs lochquelle truckenthal 452 5 m lochquellen t5 and t7 448 5 and 439 2 m as we are interested in the early long term evolution we model the incoming rivers as fixed head boundary condition to mimic hydraulic control the frankonian line separating the insoluble ordovizian quarzite and shale from the triassic limestone is visible in the back part of the sub surface the resulting hydraulic head distribution is shown in fig 5 contoured pressure lines reveal the largest gradient between the ru√übach and the defined karst springs both the gr√ºmpen and the truckenthaler grund which actually carry more water across the frankonian line induce less pronounced hydraulic gradients the reason for this distribution is the location of the valleys across the frankonian line here the ru√übach runs at the highest elevation the other two creeks at other elevations resulting in different hydraulic gradients note that in the early phase of karstification this strong hydraulic gradient is kept as the allogenic water from the thuringian slate mountains running in catchments composed of insoluble rocks keeps the runoff high in the model setup fig 5 we have also marked very simple cave geometries for the three systems ble√überg cave rauensteiner cave and triebischsystem here large caves have been explored linear in structure for the first and more complex networks for the two latter caves a successful evolution model aims to explain these karst features as prominent flow pathes next we explore the evolved fracture distribution in the muschelkalk we present two snapshots in time fig 6 for the model 2 500 years into the evolution fractures in the muschelkalk are enlarged close to the areas where the three creeks cross the frankonian line here the large hydraulic gradient of the ru√übach has initiated a sequence of enlarged fractures in the 2 5 cm range thus at least an order of magnitude larger than the initial values for the fractures from the gr√ºmpen another set of enlarged fractures grows along the frankonian line towards the east similarly the aggressive water from the truckenthaler grund is responsible for another cluster of enlarged fractures along the frankonian line further west all these enlarged clusters along the frankonian line are a result of the different hydraulic gradients induced from water of the incoming valleys note however that some clusters of enlarged fractures already start growing towards the local karst springs initiating a second direction of enlargement 10 000 years into the evolution the situation has evolved further while the clusters along the frankonian line have continued growing their growth has slowed down because the hydraulic pressure gradient becomes more pronounced in the flow directions towards the watertable we now observe clusters of enlarged fractures in the lower gr√ºmpen and ru√übach valleys with prominent flow pathes enlarged to the 10 cm size and more at the locations of the rauensteiner cave and the triebischsystem these enlarged clusters also occupy the sub surface below the part of the creeks running over the soluble muschelkalk this pattern can explain the numerous sinkholes in the creek valleys south of the frankonian line marking the infiltration of the surface water into the sub surface with no surface flow during the summer months a cluster of enlarged fractures also evolved at the location of the ble√überg cave however the sizes of the dissolutionally enlarged fractures are small when compared to the locations of the rauensteiner cave and the triebischsystem for the large ble√überg cave we want to predict a more prominent growth of fractures at this cave location we therefore add another boundary condition and inject water along the frankonian line in the western part of the evolving ble√überg cave our assumption here is that part of the drainage from the thuringian slate mountains is channeled along the prominent fault into an west eastern direction as proposed in the literature e g th√ºringer h√∂hlenverein 2008 in fig 7 we present such a model which assumes a local inflow of water along the fault zone in the sub surface which arrives at the fault with a calcium concentration of c fault 0 9 c eq this additional inflow results in a more prominent cluster of enlarged fractures around the location of the ble√überg cave which enlarged passages evolving towards the south the location of the small ble√überg cave 2 and the local spring note that we terminated the model 10 000 years into the evolution because the evolved preferential flow system is mature enough now to swallow all incoming water across the frankonian line if we would continue the model runs we would change the boundary conditions to an inflow condition for the three creeks will lower the hydraulic gradient in the triassic muschelkalk significantly the result would be a slower evolution from this time on with dissolution mainly focussed to the already enlarged zones as a consequence the 10 cm size conduits around the localities of the rauensteiner cave the triebischsystem and the ble√überg cave will grow in size we stress that we do not expect more information from continuing the model run with fixed inflow condition except when a reorganisation of the system e g valley incision tectonic uplift would occur we however have no evidence of such an event 4 2 small scale model future we proceed with a small scale model of the vicinity of the ble√überg cave which we will use to investigate the effect of blocking flow through the cave resulting from the remediation measures during the tunnel construction phase we extract a block 100 by 50 m in size and 50 m thick shown in fig 4 as white dotted line and discretise it into 101x51 nodes in horizontal and 51 nodes in vertical direction resulting in a resolution of 1 m fig 8 the block is centered around the part of the ble√überg tunnel cutting the ble√überg cave the area around the white tunnel in fig 2 while the initial fracture distribution is assigned with a mean of d Œº 1 mm and a standard deviation of d œÉ 0 05 mm for the log normal distribution the ble√überg cave is modelled as single conduit with a diameter of 2 m red conduits the ble√überg cave conduit in the model is interrupted over 15 m distance grey semi transparent area below the tunnel black wireframe and fractures are reduced to a size of 1 mm and marked as insoluble this 15 m long stretch marks the cross section of the tunnel 8 23 m height and 13 64 m width with the cave with the artificial infill of blocks and concrete to stabilise the tunnel the size of the blocked area perpendicular to the cave is 8 m wide stretching from the tunnel floor 12 m vertically into the area where the ble√überg cave crosses the tunnel note that the downstream end of the small scale model mimics flow out of the ble√überg cave which as we stated earlier is likely towards the south the end of the railway tunnel we set up two models each running for 300 years into the future to discuss the impact of different boundary conditions note that our time scale strongly depends on the boundary conditions chosen such as the hydraulic head difference and the chemistry of the cave creek ponding in front of the obstructed flow path also we can only roughly estimate the permeability around the blocked area with our model we provide a very conservative estimate as both the hydraulic head and the initial fracture distribution are taken as lower bounds first model for the first model two snapshots in time are shown in fig 9 as inflow condition we impose a fixed hydraulic head of 490 5 m on the western left side on the outflow side on the east right a fixed head of 490 m drains the system thus the pressure drop along the 100 m passage is 50 cm representing a low hydraulic gradient of 0 005 incoming water is undersaturated with respect to calcium c cave 0 9 c eq using a temperature of t 8 c and a carbon dioxide pressure of p 20000 ppm which is similar to the values chosen for the long term model as no present day measurements are available the interrupted flow path of the ble√überg cave is clearly visible not only geometrically but also in the hydraulic head contours which are pushed together across the blocked part of the cave during the evolution a classical breakthrough scenario occurs pressure lines move to the right until a flow path is established between the western and the eastern part of the blocked part of the ble√überg cave then this flow path is further enlarged and widened 200 years into the evolution several enlarged clusters of fractures try to by pass the blocked area on all sides 300 years into the evolution all clusters with fractures larger than 2 cm connect to the eastern side of the cave thus a dense mesh of dissolutionally enlarged fractures has been established which replaces the former single cave passage now blocked however the size of the newly enlarged fractures is in the centimetre range even after 300 years for the shown example second model for the second model we assume that the restriction caused by the concrete infill causes water accumulation in the western part of the ble√überg cave to impound to a height of 2 m thus boundary conditions are a fixed head condition of 492 m in the entire western part of the cave and 490 m at the far east of the cave as before with this scenario we account for the reported back flooding of the cave results for this model are shown in fig 10 now pressure lines are much denser as the hydraulic gradient is larger 0 02 the evolution of secondary permeability with similar clusters evolving around and beneath the blocked zone occurs faster when compared to the first model we conclude that water flowing through the western part of the ble√überg cave will dissolve limestone and enlarge fractures around the concrete infill below the tunnel the time frame of this enlargement depends on several imposed boundary conditions among others the hydraulic head the chemistry of the incoming solution and the initial fracture distribution around the blocked area with our two scenarios we already achieved a difference in breakthrough time of 50 thus monitoring the hydro chemistry of the ble√überg cave is an important prerequisite for assessing the risk of tunnel damage induced by the ongoing dissolution of the muschelkalk 5 conclusions we have discussed the schalkau plateau an area made up of the limestones of the triassic muschelkalk which receives aggressive surface water from the thuringian slate mountains in the north across the large fault of the frankonian line several creeks carry water towards the limestone plateau and initiate dissolution on and in the limestone aquifer several caves are known and have been mapped which can be grouped into three types i vadose river caves originating on the fault zone and directed towards the watertable following the steepest hydraulic gradient ii epi phreatic and phreatic network caves developed close to the water table and draining the area through several resurgences iii the ble√überg cave developed in and along the fault plane of the frankonian line we have shown by numerical means that all cave types can be explained with a model driven by localised input of aggressive water from the creeks draining the ordovizian rocks of the thuringian slate mountains and discharging close to the base of the triassic muschelkalk formation our simplified numerical evolution model predicts the early karstification of the schalkau plateau the model results in enlarged karstified conduits in the regions where caves are found for the third group of caves namely the ble√überg cave we considered an additional influx of aggressive water along the frankonian line with a second set of models we explored the possible future evolution of the area of the ble√überg cave which has been blocked by the concrete infill below the ble√überg tunnel this high resolution model predicts a substantial enlargement of fractures around the blocked zone the maze like enlargement of fractures to the one to ten centimeter size around the former now blocked cave passage can pose a geomechanical risk to the tunnel stability which needs to be explored with mechanical modelling and thus is beyond the scope of this paper the time scale for the enlargement in our models 100 200 years however depends strongly on the hydraulic structural and chemical parameters chosen for the model we therefore suggest a monitoring system installed in the ble√überg cave logging stage temperature and water chemistry in the cave stream to provide a base for evaluating the future evolution below the tunnel our numerical model successfully predicts known and unknown cavities in the schalkau plateau and correlated karstification patterns we demonstrate that with available field data from the location and its geological history a meaningful numerical model can be

5937,stream temperature controls biological processes and affects the species composition of aquatic communities riparian vegetation plays an important role in influencing stream temperatures due to vegetation shading and by changing the riparian microclimate wind speed relative humidity etc this paper explores the effects of spatial heterogeneity in riparian vegetation on stream temperature using a process based hydrologic model in a 5200 km2 mixed land use watershed kalamazoo river michigan usa by explicitly incorporating interactions of thermal and water fluxes at the air land surface and surface subsurface interfaces the model enables comprehensive representation of stream thermal dynamics the riparian land use effects on stream temperature are represented by coupling with a vegetation phenology module the riparian land use information is rescaled using different nested resolutions within a model grid cell to represent the land use effects on stream temperature to show that a resolution of 90 m 90 m best represents the land use effects while simulating stream temperatures using 1 km 1 km model grid cells the simulation covers a 7 year period from 2003 to 2009 during which period the results are compared with multiple observations stream thermal budgets and responses of stream temperature to vegetation change scenarios including potential deforestation effects are reported keywords vegetation stream temperature hydrologic modeling phenology land cover deforestation 1 introduction stream temperature is a key ecological variable caissie 2006 allan and castillo 2007 mediating aquatic metabolism and nutrient retention and transformation schaefer and alber 2007 starry et al 2005 as well as influencing the abundance and distribution of aquatic species including fishes ebersole et al 2001 wehrly et al 2003 understanding controls on stream temperature is necessary to predict how streams will respond to the warming climate schindler 2001 leibowitz et al 2014 while primarily driven by climatic conditions stream thermal regimes are also shaped by multiple factors including near stream riparian land cover stream groundwater interactions discharge and channel geomorphology caissie 2006 land use development and deforestation have been found to affect stream temperature regimes generally increasing diel variation johnson and jones 2000 and maximum summer temperatures are of particular interest when they could negatively impact coldwater fish habitat buisson et al 2008 hrachowitz et al 2010 kelleher et al 2012 there is considerable current interest mapulanga and naito 2019 liu et al 2019 in understanding the effects of deforestation on water yields and water quality including temperature pre and post deforestation pe√±a arancibia et al 2019 moreover streams vary in their thermal responses as a function of depth which determines their heat capacities sun et al 2015 as well as the relative influence of groundwater inputs and hyporheic exchange caissie and luce 2017 gordon et al 2012 qiu et al 2019a therefore the effects of deforestation and the role of vegetation in general can be expected to be different for large and small streams modeling approaches have been widely used to predict stream temperature responses to climate and land use change jackson et al 2017 gallice et al 2016 sun et al 2015 macdonald et al 2014 generally stream temperature models can be categorized into two groups statistical models jackson et al 2017 benyahya et al 2007 and process based hydrologic models pbhms gallice et al 2016 macdonald et al 2014 qiu et al 2019a sun et al 2015 statistical models have the advantages of simplicity and efficiency due to the relatively small data demands and computational expense however they lack the ability to offer insights into fundamental and the often coevolving roles of multiple processes or to extrapolate beyond the range of conditions under which they are calibrated pbhms explicitly simulate the interactive physical processes that drive stream temperature dynamics by solving the governing equations of mass momentum and energy conservation time dependent simulations enable pbhms to evaluate temporal variations track individual processes and understand the controlling factors beven 2002 various pbhms have been developed to study stream temperature dynamics for different research purposes for example macdonald et al 2014 developed a watershed scale river temperature model for studying the temperature dynamics in mountainous regions by solving the one dimensional heat advection equation sun et al 2015 built a river reach scale process oriented stream temperature model by focusing on the riparian land use effects recently those models have incorporated more detailed process representations to incorporate groundwater lateral advection and streambed conduction heat fluxes for example gallice et al 2016 assumed proportional relationships between streambed conduction heat flux and temperature difference between the stream and the streambed at a certain depth haag and luce 2008 estimated the streambed conduction flux by using the concept of two lumped parameters however pbhms are usually data demanding to construct models that ensure process fidelity beven 2002 particularly at the watershed scale spatial heterogeneity within the watershed could bring uncertainties in estimating the stream discharge as well as water temperature beven 1993 2001 2002 to date some pbhms either simplified the simulation of stream discharge by using empirical equations e g macdonald et al 2014 or could only be applied to small watersheds due to the fully three dimensional nature of the models and the consequent high computational expense and data requirements riparian vegetation plays an important role in controlling stream temperature via shading roth et al 2010 moore et al 2005 and by changing the riparian microclimate land use land cover maps represented using plant functional types or pfts generally contain a much finer level of detail than one can include within model grid cells to make computations tractable these maps are often reclassified to include only a small number of dominant land cover types within a model grid cell replacing land cover types that occupy only a small area within the grid cell with the dominant land cover in that cell since the outcome of this reclassification depends on the size of the grid cell the impacts of representing land cover in a hydrologic model depend on the grid resolution and stream temperature results are particularly sensitive to these details in large watersheds grid cell sizes tend to be relatively large as well to make computations practical one way to provide an adequate representation of riparian vegetation in large watersheds is to reclassify riparian land cover at a smaller nested resolution relative to the original grid size to upscale the vegetation effects to the size of the larger grid cell i e by using several nested grid cells within a larger cell for example one hundred 100 100 m nested cells can be created within a single 1 1 km grid cell however a systematic assessment of such a reclassification method and the effects of the nested grid cell resolutions on simulated stream temperatures are not reported in the literature in this paper the paws model process based adaptive watershed simulator qiu et al 2019a shen et al 2013 2014 shen and phanikumar 2010 a pbhm of intermediate complexity was used to predict streamwater temperatures over space and time across a humid temperate watershed with seasonally present deciduous vegetation canopies in the riparian zones the newly developed stream temperature model qiu et al 2019a uses the radiative transfer modules in clm 4 0 dickinson 1983 sellers 1985 oleson et al 2010 to partition radiation fluxes among riparian vegetation canopies back radiation and fluxes received by stream surfaces the dynamic seasonality of vegetation phenological properties such as leaf area index lai and stem area index sai and their effects on radiation fluxes were simulated for different plant functional types in the vegetation module of clm the watershed in the present study is considerably larger than a small experimental watershed where the model has been previously validated thus the primary aim of the present study is to further refine and test the temperature model for large watersheds in which relatively coarse spatial grid resolutions are often used research questions that will be addressed in this paper include 1 how can the riparian vegetation shading effect be approximated using relatively coarse grid resolutions e g 1 km2 used to model large watersheds 2 is there an optimal grid resolution for representing the vegetation effects in large watersheds 3 what are the dominant controls on stream temperature regimes over the seasons and 4 what is the effect of riparian deforestation on temperature in large vs small streams 2 materials and methods 2 1 model description paws is a process based distributed hydrological model that uses the finite volume method to solve the governing partial differential equations for different hydrologic domains based on structured grids shen and phanikumar 2010 shen et al 2013 2014 the paws model structure allows efficient coupling of surface and subsurface processes shen and phanikumar 2010 by simplifying the fully three dimensional 3 d variably saturated subsurface model using a combination of the one dimensional richards equation for the vertical soil column and quasi 3 d saturated groundwater equation for the aquifers assuming that lateral soil water exchanges with the stream channels are negligible shen et al 2013 the coupling of paws shen and phanikumar 2010 with the land surface model clm community land model version 4 oleson et al 2010 allows for a comprehensive representation of hydrologic and vegetation processes including land surface processes subsurface processes and interactions among different hydrologic domains shen et al 2013 applications and validation of the paws clm model have been widely reported for various watersheds around the world shen and phanikumar 2010 shen et al 2013 2014 niu et al 2014 safaie et al 2017 niu et al 2017 but the model has only been applied to simulate stream temperatures by qiu et al 2019a details of the coupled paws clm stream temperature model are described in qiu et al 2019a and therefore only a brief summary is presented here simulation domains are discretized into different lateral grid cells and vertical layers the topmost layer represents the land surface layer or overland flow layer in which surface runoff is computed based on the diffusive wave equation surface energy balances evaporation infiltration and snow processes are computed in the overland layer beneath the land surface layer are the vadose zone layers which are governed by the richards equation two groundwater layers unconfined and confined are connected to the bottommost layer of the vadose zone and are governed by the quasi 3d groundwater equation derived from darcy s law the stream segments crisscross the overland flow layer and are connected to the first groundwater layer which represents the unconfined aquifer stream discharge is governed by the one dimensional diffusive wave equation exchanging fluxes with the overland flow and groundwater layers several earlier studies demonstrated that one dimensional models adequately describe solute and thermal transport in rivers gallice et al 2016 macdonald et al 2014 anderson and phanikumar 2011 phanikumar et al 2007 shen and phanikumar 2009 therefore the stream temperature module solves the one dimensional heat transport equation eq 1 that includes multiple heat sources sinks such as short wave radiation long wave radiation back radiation latent and sensible heats and heat exchange from subsurface as shown below 1 a t s t q t s x q v w œÅ c q adv w œÅ c where ts k is the stream temperature q v w m 2 is the sum of the net heat fluxes excluding the groundwater advective heat flux qadv w m 2 is the advective heat flux due to groundwater flow a m2 and w m are the cross sectional area and wetted width of the stream segments respectively q m3 s 1 denotes stream discharge and c j kg 1 k 1 and œÅ kg m 3 are the specific heat and density of water respectively q v includes multiple heat sources sinks and can be expressed as 2 q v q s q l q h q e q f q b q m where qs w m 2 is the net short wave radiation reaching the stream surface ql w m 2 is the net longwave radiation and qh w m 2 and qe w m 2 are the sensible and latent heat fluxes qf w m 2 is the friction heat flux qb w m 2 is the stream bed heat conduction flux and qm wm 2 is the heat flux used to melt the snow when there is snow accumulation in the channel detailed calculations of these heat sources sinks in eqs 1 and 2 are described in qiu et al 2019a the hybrid lagrangian eulerian method based on an operator splitting strategy was employed to solve eq 1 niu and phanikumar 2015 following macdonald et al 2014 and leach and moore 2010 the temperatures of stream junction segments are updated at the end of each time step based on the temperatures of the upstream and downstream segments using the mixing model concept as shown in eq 3 3 t j n t up n q up n t down n q down n q up n q down n where t up n k and t down n k are the stream temperatures at the upstream and downstream junction segments at the end of time step n q up n m3 s 1 and q down n m3 s 1 are the upstream and downstream discharge rates t j n k is the updated junction segment temperature at the end of time step n the stream bed temperature module solves the one dimensional vertical heat transfer equation based on the assumption that the lateral heat transfer within the streambed is negligible caissie et al 2014 the stream temperature serves as the top boundary condition of the streambed equation and the average unconfined groundwater temperature is employed as the bottom boundary condition paws solves for temperature in the groundwater domain however since detailed groundwater temperature data are not available for the kalamazoo river watershed krw the mean annual air temperature during 2003 2009 10 07 c was used as the unconfined groundwater temperature based on previous successful model applications based on this assumption cox and bolte 2007 leach and moore 2010 additionally paws uses the soil snow temperature simulation in clm which is based on the solution of the one dimensional heat conduction equation oleson et al 2010 snow melt is simulated if the snow layer temperature is above the freezing point 2 2 study sites and data sources located in the southwest lower peninsula of michigan usa the krw drains 5200 km2 of glacial deposits that deliver water to the river primarily 70 via groundwater flow paths rheaume 1990 fig 1 the krw has an average annual precipitation of approximately 960 mm with about half falling as snow and increasing annual snowfall is observed from the head waters to the outlet due to the effect of lake michigan wesley 2005 annual evapotranspiration et accounts for approximately 61 percent 580 mm of the annual precipitation wesley 2005 qiu et al 2019b mean daily air temperatures for the recent decade range from approximately 24 c to 38 c the land surface elevation ranges from 175 to 380 m a s l agriculture dominated by corn and soybeans is the primary land use which occupies approximately 47 of the watershed followed by forest 21 open land 9 and urban 7 fig 2 the paws model integrated multiple sources of geographical information system gis data shen et al 2014 elaborated the data integration algorithms for constructing the paws model and the primary data sources are briefly described here the overland layer was built with the 30 m

national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa and the michigan automated weather station network mawn now called enviroweather http www enviroweather msu edu locations of the meteorological stations are shown in fig 1 spatial data on depth to groundwater based on static water levels in water supply wells throughout the watershed were obtained from the state of michigan s welllogic database https secure1 state mi us wellogic soil temperature data from two mawn stations the albion station and the msu kellogg biological station msukbs are used to test the model the nearest neighbor method was used to interpolate stations data to model grids onset stowaway xti model 2 sensors were used for stream temperature data collection accuracy of better than 0 6 c 2 3 model setup a grid resolution of 1000 1000 m was used for horizontal discretization which produced a mesh of 101 150 grids for the entire watershed 20 vertical layers were used to simulate the vadose zone dynamics and 2 layers for the groundwater domain unconfined and confined aquifers the streams were discretized as 1 km segments for solving the governing stream discharge and water temperature equations the model incorporated up to level 5 rivers to represent a more realistic channel network and to reduce model uncertainties resulting from reduced channel density wang and wu 2013 to better represent the vegetation effect of the riparian land cover the fractions of stream segment pfts were resampled by extracting finer scale riparian pfts along each 1 km stream segment as shown in fig 3 the land cover information was extracted in fine nested grid cells and the land cover categories and portions were recalculated by adding the fractions of different pfts in the square boxes three dominant pfts were selected including the stream portion as a pft of open water to calculate the weighted sum radiation fluxes qiu et al 2019a since all grid cells adjacent to stream channels will contain open water as a land cover during land cover reclassification a minimum portion of water should be maintained to ensure that the effects of vegetation on water are adequately represented based on sensitivity analysis a minimum portion of 20 water was assigned to underscore the stream pft representing open water that is if water is incorporated into the three dominant pfts then max water portion within the three pfts 20 will be chosen as the water portion otherwise the water portion is assigned as 20 and the other three dominant land covers occupy the remaining 80 the impacts of representing riparian vegetation were evaluated by comparing the simulated results using different nested grid resolutions within a larger 1 1 km grid cell and comparing the simulation results with observed data the differential evolution algorithm price et al 2005 was employed to tune the model parameters for improving the model performance in predicting stream discharge groundwater heads and et rates parameters and their physical meanings were summarized in shen et al 2013 3 results and discussion in this section model performance is assessed by comparing simulated results with field observations the primary model performance metrics employed are the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nash nash and sutcliffe 1970 and the root mean squared error rmse 3 1 hydrological simulations model performance evaluated using observed datasets for stream discharge groundwater heads and evapotranspiration during a 7 year simulation period 2003 2009 has been previously reported for the krw by qiu et al 2019b although the earlier results were based on a slightly different set of calibration methods and parameters in the earlier paper multi site calibration was used with a different set of parameters in each sub watershed to address the research questions in that paper while a single set of parameters was used for the entire watershed in this paper here a brief description is included on how model results for hydrological variables are validated additionally the simulated lai values are compared with satellite observations from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis https search earthdata nasa gov because the seasonal vegetation growth cycle is important for simulating stream temperature the simulated stream discharge results during the 7 year period are compared with usgs observations for four different gauging stations in the watershed in fig s1 supplementary material the nash and rmse values tabulated in table s1 supplementary material show satisfactory model performance the simulated discharge near the watershed outlet matched the amplitude and fluctuations of observed stream discharge at the nearby usgs gauge 04108660 kalamazoo river at new richmond michigan fairly well however some peak stream discharge values are overestimated by the model it should be noted that rather than purely calibrating to the stream discharge the model performance was constrained by calibrating to stream discharge groundwater heads and monthly et simultaneously the stream discharge performance may be offset because of compensation errors among different hydrologic components see for example anderton et al 2002 beven and freer 2001 additionally inaccurate representation of field heterogeneities and uncertainties within both input data and observations could also lead to the imperfect comparisons for stream discharge beven 1993 2001 anderton et al 2002 beven and freer 2001 overall the simulated stream discharge results are considered acceptable considering all sources of uncertainty the monthly simulated et results watershed average compare well overall with the modis mod16 satellite observations fig s2 supplementary material although in some summer months simulated results overestimate et while during the coldest winter months the model underestimates et relative to mod16 data this could be attributed to the different algorithms used in the mod16 product and paws clm the mod16 et product is based on the penman monteith formulation mu et al 2011 while paws clm uses a resistance approach based on the two big leaf model dai et al 2004 to calculate et the comparison between simulated depth to groundwater table and the michigan statewide welllogic data is shown in fig s3 supplementary material a nash value of 0 90 shows that a good agreement was obtained between simulated depth to the water table and the observed data although there is a tendency for the simulated depth to water table to move below the 1 1 line indicating on average higher simulated groundwater table depth compared with well logic data this discrepancy could be attributed to several reasons including potentially overestimated recharge underestimated groundwater contribution to rivers and uncertainties in hydraulic conductivities of the glacial deposits additionally the simulated lai values are compared with the level 4 8 day modis data mod15 https search earthdata nasa gov in fig 4 which shows the temporal lai comparisons between mod15 data and simulated results for four representative vegetation covers during 2005 2007 when the representative vegetation occupied more than 85 of the area of the simulated grid cell for these comparisons the four vegetation covers are chosen since they represent the primary vegetation types in the krw and have different peak lai values model results show somewhat abrupt lai increases in the beginning of the growing season and decreases at the end of the season for all four representative vegetation covers while the modis data shows a relatively smooth change fig 4a this difference is most obvious for c3 grass moreover the model overestimates the duration of high lai values of c3 grass compared with modis data this discrepancy may be due to the phenological parameters utilized for the c3 crop in the clm and or uncertainties associated with the modis product several outliers are observed for corn during the growing season of 2005 in this period the model results show lai in the range of 3 4 while several observed lai values are above 5 these outliers may be attributed to the uncertainties in the remotely sensed modis data including cloud contamination or other data quality issues fig 4b shows the comparison of spatially distributed lai for two 8 day periods in june and december respectively during june the spatial pattern of lai is mostly matched between simulated results and observations including the high lai values in the northwest and some parts within the middle of the watershed forest is the major land cover in northwestern krw which tends to show high lai values during the growing season meanwhile the lake effect increases the length of the growing season from roughly 150 days at the eastern end of the krw to approximately 180 days near the river mouth and lake michigan which could also contribute to the higher lai two blank areas in the south central part of krw for the modis data are urban areas where the model generates very low lai values although the dominant land cover is urban for these two areas some minor portions of land cover contributions may still produce positive lai values for example the grass and trees in parks which are included in the model this information is reflected in the data integration algorithm of paws clm which assimilates data at fine resolutions and then upscales to grid resolution by preserving the major information shen et al 2014 during december for the most part both the simulated and modis data show nearly zero lai values the northwest region of the watershed shows relatively higher lai values in december which are primarily explained by evergreen forest mostly conifer plantations 3 2 soil temperature simulations the simulated soil temperatures at a depth of 10 cm are compared with observations at two mawn stations in fig 5 the comparison at station msukbs is only shown from december 2007 to july 2009 based on data availability except in the coldest periods the daily fluctuations of soil temperature are captured quite well by the model with nash values of 0 84 and 0 80 for albion and michigan state university s kellogg biological station msukbs respectively the amplitude of simulated summer soil temperatures matched well with observations at albion station as shown in fig 5 a although at station msukbs the amplitudes of peak summer temperatures are slightly underestimated which may be due to overestimated vegetation shading effect at this station fig 5b in the coldest winter periods the observed temperatures show nearly constant values around 0 c whereas the simulated results show much lower temperatures these discrepancies are due to the known limitations in describing the movement of water through frozen soil in clm 4 0 and are associated with soil hydraulic and thermal property schemes used while simulating freeze thaw cycles swenson et al 2012 chen et al 2018 fang et al 2016 fortunately accurate simulation of the coldest soil temperatures is not important to the goals of this study because as long as the surface soils are frozen there is neither infiltration nor overland runoff 3 3 stream temperature simulations 3 3 1 effects of resolving spatial heterogeneity in riparian vegetation the effects of resolving the spatial variability in riparian vegetation on simulated stream temperatures were evaluated by testing the model performance using different nested land use resolutions within model grid cells encompassing the streams and their riparian zones the sizes of the nested grids within the 1 1 km model grid cell were 60 m 60 m 90 90 m 250 250 m and 1000 1000 m the stream temperature comparisons were performed at eight observational sites when observed stream temperature data are available during the simulation period locations in fig 1 all comparisons are shown at hourly scales except for the kalamazoo river station near allegan usgs 04107850 for which only daily average temperatures were available the performance metrics for the tests are tabulated in table 1 simulations with land use resolutions of 60 and 90 m show similar performance and are generally better than model performance based on resolutions of 250 and 1000 m at the marshall site 90 m showed the best performance among the four test cases three observation sites were selected to present the performance difference fig 6 the land cover pfts and percentages for the stream segments where the three observational sites are located are shown in fig 7 as the resolution of the nested grids used to represent land cover within a model grid cell changes the dominant land cover fractions within the model grid cell change resulting in changes in simulated stream temperature due to changes in riparian climate for example at the allegan site usgs 04107850 deciduous broadleaf is the most dominant riparian land cover for all the four resolutions tested open water fractions for 60 and 90 m resolution riparian land use datasets exceeded the minimum threshold of 20 while open water fractions with resolutions of 250 and 1000 m are estimated as the default 20 as a result the summer water temperature at this site was underestimated using 250 and 1000 m riparian land cover resolutions in contrast at the spring brook site the summer temperature was overestimated using land cover information from 250 and 1000 m nested grids which could be explained by the relatively small percentage of deciduous broadleaf and thus the relatively small summer shading effect using 250 and 1000 m riparian land cover at the bear creek site dominant land cover types and percentages for all four spatial resolutions are almost the same accordingly the simulated stream temperature results did not show significant differences in light of these results all subsequent simulations of stream temperature presented in the paper are based on the optimum resolution of 90 m 90 m for resampling the land cover information within a model grid cell of 1 km 1 km 3 3 2 comparisons with observed stream temperature data comparisons of simulated and observed stream temperature for the eight observation sites are shown in fig 8 for the observation sites at indian creek fig 8f and marshall fig 8g simulated stream temperature results show negative temperature values during some days in winter while the observed temperature remains constant around 0 c which is similar to the discrepancy in soil temperature comparisons presented earlier this is probably due to overestimation of subzero soil temperatures in winter as noted earlier which also influence stream temperatures via exchange fluxes in addition the high turbulence of flowing water tends to prevent freezing mohseni and stefan 1999 although friction heat flux due to fluid friction at the river bed and the banks is included in the modeling detailed effects of turbulence were not explicitly modeled previous research suggested that neglecting the energy associated with snowmelt could impact stream temperature simulations caissie et al 2007 although the paws model via clm takes the energy of snowmelt into consideration as described in qiu et al 2019a freezing and thawing of stream ice are not explicitly simulated future efforts will focus on improving the representations of stream ice and phase change processes at the silver creek site the winter temperature is underestimated by the model from december 2008 to february 2009 fig 8b underestimated warm heat fluxes from the subsurface during winter periods may be responsible for this mismatch at the schnable brook site the amplitude of diurnal temperature fluctuations is overestimated by the model which may be due to inaccurate representation of stream geometry and or inaccurate stream discharge outputs fig 8d diurnal stream temperature fluctuations are found to be sensitive to stream geometries width and depth e g macdonald et al 2014 the stream width values were estimated from reported values wesley 2005 and google earth which may have introduced uncertainties into the stream width representation in addition stream discharge influences the stream heat capacity and the advective heat fluxes although the stream discharges were calibrated to several usgs gauges it is possible for mismatches to exist between simulated discharge and actual discharge in uncalibrated tributaries due to a combination of factors these factors may include inaccurate representation of the heterogeneities in stream properties such as stream depths and widths as well as processes not simulated such as tile drains at the marshall site the summer temperature of 2008 is slightly underestimated by the model fig 8g in contrast at the indian creek site the summer temperature of 2009 is slightly overestimated fig 8f possible explanations for these discrepancies in summer temperatures could include the inaccurate estimation of vegetation shading effects and or the heat fluxes from the subsurface moreover the assumption of a minimum 20 of water fraction within the grid cell may not exactly describe the reality for example forest streams may be fully shaded by broadleaf trees in summer it should also be noted that the observed data are point measurements while the model results represent average values of temperature in a 1 km stream segment discrepancies could occur if the vegetation covers around the sampled points are significantly different from the average cover along the 1 km stream segment despite these general observations and caveats a good overall agreement is noted between observations and model results fig 8 3 3 3 seasonal heat budgets average seasonal heat flux budgets during the simulation period were calculated at the temperature measurement sites fig 9 for all the eight sites the dominant heat source is net radiation and the primary heat sink is latent heat which is consistent with the literature e g macdonald et al 2014 leach and moore 2010 sensible heat flux is a heat sink in spring autumn and winter while it shifts to a heat source in summer heat flux from the subsurface is an important component that switches from a source in spring and winter to a sink in summer and fall during the simulation period therefore subsurface heat fluxes serve as a heat buffer to cool down the high summer temperatures and warm up the cold winter temperatures this underscores the importance of investigating the connections between surface water and groundwater temperatures and their co evolving responses in a warming climate kurylyk et al 2013 friction heat flux and snowmelt heat flux occupy a small portion of the heat budget and show relatively less impact on the stream thermal regimes in this study given the similar latitudes of the eight sampling sites incoming solar radiation and longwave radiation fluxes can be expected to be similar for all sites however distinct seasonal net radiation heat fluxes are shown for the eight sampling sites this shows the significant role the vegetation shading effect plays in altering the net radiation fluxes received by the stream surface in different reaches fig 10 shows average spatially distributed stream temperatures for the krw during the simulation period for summer fig 10a and winter fig 10b respectively five distinct locations in the watershed are marked using rectangular boxes for further examination of the spatial patterns at location 1 the two highlighted stream segments are connected to several lakes which are less affected by the vegetation shading effect thus the summer temperature are relatively high similarly at location 2 where the riparian land cover is dominated by urban and open land high summer temperatures occur as the vegetation shading effect becomes less important in contrast location 3 shows relatively cool summer temperatures and low winter temperatures which are primarily due to a higher fraction of riparian forest broadleaf deciduous the spring brook monitoring site is located at location 4 which shows relatively low summer temperatures and relatively warm winter temperatures the higher subsurface heat flux contributions at the site stabilize the temperatures in tributaries of location 4 see also fig 9 in contrast at location 5 simulated results show relatively high temperatures in summer and low temperatures in winter which can be attributed to the relatively small subsurface heat flux contributions 3 3 4 stream temperature responses to potential deforestation to evaluate the potential effects of deforestation on high summer temperatures a modeling scenario was conducted by replacing 10 of the deciduous broadleaf forest with c3 grass for river segments that contained a riparian land cover of more than 10 deciduous broadleaf forest this change is only incorporated into calculations of stream incoming radiation heat fluxes while preserving calculations of other hydrologic variables such as river discharge and et a map of the june july average daily stream temperature difference simulated temperature from this scenario minus the baseline temperature is shown in fig 11 as expected small and lower order usually headwater streams are more sensitive to potential deforestation effects due to their relatively small heat capacities in comparison with large and higher order rivers the extreme temperature increase could reach 6 7 c three example stream segments that initially have more than 10 riparian deciduous broadleaf forest are highlighted to understand the temperature changes under the deforestation scenario marked as boxes 1 3 in fig 11 results for three relevant hydrologic properties the average stream width average stream depth and the baseflow index bfi which is the ratio of groundwater contribution to total stream discharge volume during june july are shown in table 2 segment 1 shows the highest temperature increase among the three segments it has moderate stream width and depth values but the lowest bfi values lacking the buffering effect from cooler groundwater this stream segment is most vulnerable to potential deforestation segment 2 is one of the headwater streams of the kalamazoo river and has a bfi of more than half during june july however the small stream size increased its sensitivity to potential deforestation and as a result the temperature increased by 4 4 5 c segment 3 shows the least temperature increase a relatively high bfi value and stream size render this stream least sensitive to potential deforestation effects in these scenarios the mean annual air temperature was used as the groundwater temperature as explained earlier however shallow groundwater temperatures could respond to short term air temperature and land surface temperature changes kurylyk et al 2013 which may in turn influence surface water temperatures ultimately the groundwater temperature in the aquifers that supply much of the stream discharge will respond to the warming climate though likely over decadal time scales in this watershed results of this work indicate the possibility to extend the application of the developed model to evaluate the coevolving effects of climate and land cover changes on stream temperature regimes which will be increasingly important to identify effective strategies for fisheries and aquatic ecosystem management 4 conclusions this study extended the paws clm model using a newly developed stream temperature module applying it to a 5200 km2 mixed land use watershed publicly available spatial data sets were used the optimal spatial resolution for representing riparian vegetation effects was identified and process based simulations were validated using field measurements of soil and stream water temperatures the model was applied to quantitively evaluate the effects of riparian vegetation on the stream temperatures accounting for land use and cover and seasonal vegetation phenology the model results suggested overall satisfactory performance considering several sources of uncertainties the vegetation effects are best represented by upscaling the land use information with a grid resolution of 90 m 90 m while using 1 km 1 km model grid cells to simulate the stream discharge and temperature model results based on the potential

5937,stream temperature controls biological processes and affects the species composition of aquatic communities riparian vegetation plays an important role in influencing stream temperatures due to vegetation shading and by changing the riparian microclimate wind speed relative humidity etc this paper explores the effects of spatial heterogeneity in riparian vegetation on stream temperature using a process based hydrologic model in a 5200 km2 mixed land use watershed kalamazoo river michigan usa by explicitly incorporating interactions of thermal and water fluxes at the air land surface and surface subsurface interfaces the model enables comprehensive representation of stream thermal dynamics the riparian land use effects on stream temperature are represented by coupling with a vegetation phenology module the riparian land use information is rescaled using different nested resolutions within a model grid cell to represent the land use effects on stream temperature to show that a resolution of 90 m 90 m best represents the land use effects while simulating stream temperatures using 1 km 1 km model grid cells the simulation covers a 7 year period from 2003 to 2009 during which period the results are compared with multiple observations stream thermal budgets and responses of stream temperature to vegetation change scenarios including potential deforestation effects are reported keywords vegetation stream temperature hydrologic modeling phenology land cover deforestation 1 introduction stream temperature is a key ecological variable caissie 2006 allan and castillo 2007 mediating aquatic metabolism and nutrient retention and transformation schaefer and alber 2007 starry et al 2005 as well as influencing the abundance and distribution of aquatic species including fishes ebersole et al 2001 wehrly et al 2003 understanding controls on stream temperature is necessary to predict how streams will respond to the warming climate schindler 2001 leibowitz et al 2014 while primarily driven by climatic conditions stream thermal regimes are also shaped by multiple factors including near stream riparian land cover stream groundwater interactions discharge and channel geomorphology caissie 2006 land use development and deforestation have been found to affect stream temperature regimes generally increasing diel variation johnson and jones 2000 and maximum summer temperatures are of particular interest when they could negatively impact coldwater fish habitat buisson et al 2008 hrachowitz et al 2010 kelleher et al 2012 there is considerable current interest mapulanga and naito 2019 liu et al 2019 in understanding the effects of deforestation on water yields and water quality including temperature pre and post deforestation pe√±a arancibia et al 2019 moreover streams vary in their thermal responses as a function of depth which determines their heat capacities sun et al 2015 as well as the relative influence of groundwater inputs and hyporheic exchange caissie and luce 2017 gordon et al 2012 qiu et al 2019a therefore the effects of deforestation and the role of vegetation in general can be expected to be different for large and small streams modeling approaches have been widely used to predict stream temperature responses to climate and land use change jackson et al 2017 gallice et al 2016 sun et al 2015 macdonald et al 2014 generally stream temperature models can be categorized into two groups statistical models jackson et al 2017 benyahya et al 2007 and process based hydrologic models pbhms gallice et al 2016 macdonald et al 2014 qiu et al 2019a sun et al 2015 statistical models have the advantages of simplicity and efficiency due to the relatively small data demands and computational expense however they lack the ability to offer insights into fundamental and the often coevolving roles of multiple processes or to extrapolate beyond the range of conditions under which they are calibrated pbhms explicitly simulate the interactive physical processes that drive stream temperature dynamics by solving the governing equations of mass momentum and energy conservation time dependent simulations enable pbhms to evaluate temporal variations track individual processes and understand the controlling factors beven 2002 various pbhms have been developed to study stream temperature dynamics for different research purposes for example macdonald et al 2014 developed a watershed scale river temperature model for studying the temperature dynamics in mountainous regions by solving the one dimensional heat advection equation sun et al 2015 built a river reach scale process oriented stream temperature model by focusing on the riparian land use effects recently those models have incorporated more detailed process representations to incorporate groundwater lateral advection and streambed conduction heat fluxes for example gallice et al 2016 assumed proportional relationships between streambed conduction heat flux and temperature difference between the stream and the streambed at a certain depth haag and luce 2008 estimated the streambed conduction flux by using the concept of two lumped parameters however pbhms are usually data demanding to construct models that ensure process fidelity beven 2002 particularly at the watershed scale spatial heterogeneity within the watershed could bring uncertainties in estimating the stream discharge as well as water temperature beven 1993 2001 2002 to date some pbhms either simplified the simulation of stream discharge by using empirical equations e g macdonald et al 2014 or could only be applied to small watersheds due to the fully three dimensional nature of the models and the consequent high computational expense and data requirements riparian vegetation plays an important role in controlling stream temperature via shading roth et al 2010 moore et al 2005 and by changing the riparian microclimate land use land cover maps represented using plant functional types or pfts generally contain a much finer level of detail than one can include within model grid cells to make computations tractable these maps are often reclassified to include only a small number of dominant land cover types within a model grid cell replacing land cover types that occupy only a small area within the grid cell with the dominant land cover in that cell since the outcome of this reclassification depends on the size of the grid cell the impacts of representing land cover in a hydrologic model depend on the grid resolution and stream temperature results are particularly sensitive to these details in large watersheds grid cell sizes tend to be relatively large as well to make computations practical one way to provide an adequate representation of riparian vegetation in large watersheds is to reclassify riparian land cover at a smaller nested resolution relative to the original grid size to upscale the vegetation effects to the size of the larger grid cell i e by using several nested grid cells within a larger cell for example one hundred 100 100 m nested cells can be created within a single 1 1 km grid cell however a systematic assessment of such a reclassification method and the effects of the nested grid cell resolutions on simulated stream temperatures are not reported in the literature in this paper the paws model process based adaptive watershed simulator qiu et al 2019a shen et al 2013 2014 shen and phanikumar 2010 a pbhm of intermediate complexity was used to predict streamwater temperatures over space and time across a humid temperate watershed with seasonally present deciduous vegetation canopies in the riparian zones the newly developed stream temperature model qiu et al 2019a uses the radiative transfer modules in clm 4 0 dickinson 1983 sellers 1985 oleson et al 2010 to partition radiation fluxes among riparian vegetation canopies back radiation and fluxes received by stream surfaces the dynamic seasonality of vegetation phenological properties such as leaf area index lai and stem area index sai and their effects on radiation fluxes were simulated for different plant functional types in the vegetation module of clm the watershed in the present study is considerably larger than a small experimental watershed where the model has been previously validated thus the primary aim of the present study is to further refine and test the temperature model for large watersheds in which relatively coarse spatial grid resolutions are often used research questions that will be addressed in this paper include 1 how can the riparian vegetation shading effect be approximated using relatively coarse grid resolutions e g 1 km2 used to model large watersheds 2 is there an optimal grid resolution for representing the vegetation effects in large watersheds 3 what are the dominant controls on stream temperature regimes over the seasons and 4 what is the effect of riparian deforestation on temperature in large vs small streams 2 materials and methods 2 1 model description paws is a process based distributed hydrological model that uses the finite volume method to solve the governing partial differential equations for different hydrologic domains based on structured grids shen and phanikumar 2010 shen et al 2013 2014 the paws model structure allows efficient coupling of surface and subsurface processes shen and phanikumar 2010 by simplifying the fully three dimensional 3 d variably saturated subsurface model using a combination of the one dimensional richards equation for the vertical soil column and quasi 3 d saturated groundwater equation for the aquifers assuming that lateral soil water exchanges with the stream channels are negligible shen et al 2013 the coupling of paws shen and phanikumar 2010 with the land surface model clm community land model version 4 oleson et al 2010 allows for a comprehensive representation of hydrologic and vegetation processes including land surface processes subsurface processes and interactions among different hydrologic domains shen et al 2013 applications and validation of the paws clm model have been widely reported for various watersheds around the world shen and phanikumar 2010 shen et al 2013 2014 niu et al 2014 safaie et al 2017 niu et al 2017 but the model has only been applied to simulate stream temperatures by qiu et al 2019a details of the coupled paws clm stream temperature model are described in qiu et al 2019a and therefore only a brief summary is presented here simulation domains are discretized into different lateral grid cells and vertical layers the topmost layer represents the land surface layer or overland flow layer in which surface runoff is computed based on the diffusive wave equation surface energy balances evaporation infiltration and snow processes are computed in the overland layer beneath the land surface layer are the vadose zone layers which are governed by the richards equation two groundwater layers unconfined and confined are connected to the bottommost layer of the vadose zone and are governed by the quasi 3d groundwater equation derived from darcy s law the stream segments crisscross the overland flow layer and are connected to the first groundwater layer which represents the unconfined aquifer stream discharge is governed by the one dimensional diffusive wave equation exchanging fluxes with the overland flow and groundwater layers several earlier studies demonstrated that one dimensional models adequately describe solute and thermal transport in rivers gallice et al 2016 macdonald et al 2014 anderson and phanikumar 2011 phanikumar et al 2007 shen and phanikumar 2009 therefore the stream temperature module solves the one dimensional heat transport equation eq 1 that includes multiple heat sources sinks such as short wave radiation long wave radiation back radiation latent and sensible heats and heat exchange from subsurface as shown below 1 a t s t q t s x q v w œÅ c q adv w œÅ c where ts k is the stream temperature q v w m 2 is the sum of the net heat fluxes excluding the groundwater advective heat flux qadv w m 2 is the advective heat flux due to groundwater flow a m2 and w m are the cross sectional area and wetted width of the stream segments respectively q m3 s 1 denotes stream discharge and c j kg 1 k 1 and œÅ kg m 3 are the specific heat and density of water respectively q v includes multiple heat sources sinks and can be expressed as 2 q v q s q l q h q e q f q b q m where qs w m 2 is the net short wave radiation reaching the stream surface ql w m 2 is the net longwave radiation and qh w m 2 and qe w m 2 are the sensible and latent heat fluxes qf w m 2 is the friction heat flux qb w m 2 is the stream bed heat conduction flux and qm wm 2 is the heat flux used to melt the snow when there is snow accumulation in the channel detailed calculations of these heat sources sinks in eqs 1 and 2 are described in qiu et al 2019a the hybrid lagrangian eulerian method based on an operator splitting strategy was employed to solve eq 1 niu and phanikumar 2015 following macdonald et al 2014 and leach and moore 2010 the temperatures of stream junction segments are updated at the end of each time step based on the temperatures of the upstream and downstream segments using the mixing model concept as shown in eq 3 3 t j n t up n q up n t down n q down n q up n q down n where t up n k and t down n k are the stream temperatures at the upstream and downstream junction segments at the end of time step n q up n m3 s 1 and q down n m3 s 1 are the upstream and downstream discharge rates t j n k is the updated junction segment temperature at the end of time step n the stream bed temperature module solves the one dimensional vertical heat transfer equation based on the assumption that the lateral heat transfer within the streambed is negligible caissie et al 2014 the stream temperature serves as the top boundary condition of the streambed equation and the average unconfined groundwater temperature is employed as the bottom boundary condition paws solves for temperature in the groundwater domain however since detailed groundwater temperature data are not available for the kalamazoo river watershed krw the mean annual air temperature during 2003 2009 10 07 c was used as the unconfined groundwater temperature based on previous successful model applications based on this assumption cox and bolte 2007 leach and moore 2010 additionally paws uses the soil snow temperature simulation in clm which is based on the solution of the one dimensional heat conduction equation oleson et al 2010 snow melt is simulated if the snow layer temperature is above the freezing point 2 2 study sites and data sources located in the southwest lower peninsula of michigan usa the krw drains 5200 km2 of glacial deposits that deliver water to the river primarily 70 via groundwater flow paths rheaume 1990 fig 1 the krw has an average annual precipitation of approximately 960 mm with about half falling as snow and increasing annual snowfall is observed from the head waters to the outlet due to the effect of lake michigan wesley 2005 annual evapotranspiration et accounts for approximately 61 percent 580 mm of the annual precipitation wesley 2005 qiu et al 2019b mean daily air temperatures for the recent decade range from approximately 24 c to 38 c the land surface elevation ranges from 175 to 380 m a s l agriculture dominated by corn and soybeans is the primary land use which occupies approximately 47 of the watershed followed by forest 21 open land 9 and urban 7 fig 2 the paws model integrated multiple sources of geographical information system gis

national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa and the michigan automated weather station network mawn now called enviroweather http www enviroweather msu edu locations of the meteorological stations are shown in fig 1 spatial data on depth to groundwater based on static water levels in water supply wells throughout the watershed were obtained from the state of michigan s welllogic database https secure1 state mi us wellogic soil temperature data from two mawn stations the albion station and the msu kellogg biological station msukbs are used to test the model the nearest neighbor method was used to interpolate stations data to model grids onset stowaway xti model 2 sensors were used for stream temperature data collection accuracy of better than 0 6 c 2 3 model setup a grid resolution of 1000 1000 m was used for horizontal discretization which produced a mesh of 101 150 grids for the entire watershed 20 vertical layers were used to simulate the vadose zone dynamics and 2 layers for the groundwater domain unconfined and confined aquifers the streams were discretized as 1 km segments for solving the governing stream discharge and water temperature equations the model incorporated up to level 5 rivers to represent a more realistic channel network and to reduce model uncertainties resulting from reduced channel density wang and wu 2013 to better represent the vegetation effect of the riparian land cover the fractions of stream segment pfts were resampled by extracting finer scale riparian pfts along each 1 km stream segment as shown in fig 3 the land cover information was extracted in fine nested grid cells and the land cover categories and portions were recalculated by adding the fractions of different pfts in the square boxes three dominant pfts were selected including the stream portion as a pft of open water to calculate the weighted sum radiation fluxes qiu et al 2019a since all grid cells adjacent to stream channels will contain open water as a land cover during land cover reclassification a minimum portion of water should be maintained to ensure that the effects of vegetation on water are adequately represented based on sensitivity analysis a minimum portion of 20 water was assigned to underscore the stream pft representing open water that is if water is incorporated into the three dominant pfts then max water portion within the three pfts 20 will be chosen as the water portion otherwise the water portion is assigned as 20 and the other three dominant land covers occupy the remaining 80 the impacts of representing riparian vegetation were evaluated by comparing the simulated results using different nested grid resolutions within a larger 1 1 km grid cell and comparing the simulation results with observed data the differential evolution algorithm price et al 2005 was employed to tune the model parameters for improving the model performance in predicting stream discharge groundwater heads and et rates parameters and their physical meanings were summarized in shen et al 2013 3 results and discussion in this section model performance is assessed by comparing simulated results with field observations the primary model performance metrics employed are the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nash nash and sutcliffe 1970 and the root mean squared error rmse 3 1 hydrological simulations model performance evaluated using observed datasets for stream discharge groundwater heads and evapotranspiration during a 7 year simulation period 2003 2009 has been previously reported for the krw by qiu et al 2019b although the earlier results were based on a slightly different set of calibration methods and parameters in the earlier paper multi site calibration was used with a different set of parameters in each sub watershed to address the research questions in that paper while a single set of parameters was used for the entire watershed in this paper here a brief description is included on how model results for hydrological variables are validated additionally the simulated lai values are compared with satellite observations from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis https search earthdata nasa gov because the seasonal vegetation growth cycle is important for simulating stream temperature the simulated stream discharge results during the 7 year period are compared with usgs observations for four different gauging stations in the watershed in fig s1 supplementary material the nash and rmse values tabulated in table s1 supplementary material show satisfactory model performance the simulated discharge near the watershed outlet matched the amplitude and fluctuations of observed stream discharge at the nearby usgs gauge 04108660 kalamazoo river at new richmond michigan fairly well however some peak stream discharge values are overestimated by the model it should be noted that rather than purely calibrating to the stream discharge the model performance was constrained by calibrating to stream discharge groundwater heads and monthly et simultaneously the stream discharge performance may be offset because of compensation errors among different hydrologic components see for example anderton et al 2002 beven and freer 2001 additionally inaccurate representation of field heterogeneities and uncertainties within both input data and observations could also lead to the imperfect comparisons for stream discharge beven 1993 2001 anderton et al 2002 beven and freer 2001 overall the simulated stream discharge results are considered acceptable considering all sources of uncertainty the monthly simulated et results watershed average compare well overall with the modis mod16 satellite observations fig s2 supplementary material although in some summer months simulated results overestimate et while during the coldest winter months the model underestimates et relative to mod16 data this could be attributed to the different algorithms used in the mod16 product and paws clm the mod16 et product is based on the penman monteith formulation mu et al 2011 while paws clm uses a resistance approach based on the two big leaf model dai et al 2004 to calculate et the comparison between simulated depth to groundwater table and the michigan statewide welllogic data is shown in fig s3 supplementary material a nash value of 0 90 shows that a good agreement was obtained between simulated depth to the water table and the observed data although there is a tendency for the simulated depth to water table to move below the 1 1 line indicating on average higher simulated groundwater table depth compared with well logic data this discrepancy could be attributed to several reasons including potentially overestimated recharge underestimated groundwater contribution to rivers and uncertainties in hydraulic conductivities of the glacial deposits additionally the simulated lai values are compared with the level 4 8 day modis data mod15 https search earthdata nasa gov in fig 4 which shows the temporal lai comparisons between mod15 data and simulated results for four representative vegetation covers during 2005 2007 when the representative vegetation occupied more than 85 of the area of the simulated grid cell for these comparisons the four vegetation covers are chosen since they represent the primary vegetation types in the krw and have different peak lai values model results show somewhat abrupt lai increases in the beginning of the growing season and decreases at the end of the season for all four representative vegetation covers while the modis data shows a relatively smooth change fig 4a this difference is most obvious for c3 grass moreover the model overestimates the duration of high lai values of c3 grass compared with modis data this discrepancy may be due to the phenological parameters utilized for the c3 crop in the clm and or uncertainties associated with the modis product several outliers are observed for corn during the growing season of 2005 in this period the model results show lai in the range of 3 4 while several observed lai values are above 5 these outliers may be attributed to the uncertainties in the remotely sensed modis data including cloud contamination or other data quality issues fig 4b shows the comparison of spatially distributed lai for two 8 day periods in june and december respectively during june the spatial pattern of lai is mostly matched between simulated results and observations including the high lai values in the northwest and some parts within the middle of the watershed forest is the major land cover in northwestern krw which tends to show high lai values during the growing season meanwhile the lake effect increases the length of the growing season from roughly 150 days at the eastern end of the krw to approximately 180 days near the river mouth and lake michigan which could also contribute to the higher lai two blank areas in the south central part of krw for the modis data are urban areas where the model generates very low lai values although the dominant land cover is urban for these two areas some minor portions of land cover contributions may still produce positive lai values for example the grass and trees in parks which are included in the model this information is reflected in the data integration algorithm of paws clm which assimilates data at fine resolutions and then upscales to grid resolution by preserving the major information shen et al 2014 during december for the most part both the simulated and modis data show nearly zero lai values the northwest region of the watershed shows relatively higher lai values in december which are primarily explained by evergreen forest mostly conifer plantations 3 2 soil temperature simulations the simulated soil temperatures at a depth of 10 cm are compared with observations at two mawn stations in fig 5 the comparison at station msukbs is only shown from december 2007 to july 2009 based on data availability except in the coldest periods the daily fluctuations of soil temperature are captured quite well by the model with nash values of 0 84 and 0 80 for albion and michigan state university s kellogg biological station msukbs respectively the amplitude of simulated summer soil temperatures matched well with observations at albion station as shown in fig 5 a although at station msukbs the amplitudes of peak summer temperatures are slightly underestimated which may be due to overestimated vegetation shading effect at this station fig 5b in the coldest winter periods the observed temperatures show nearly constant values around 0 c whereas the simulated results show much lower temperatures these discrepancies are due to the known limitations in describing the movement of water through frozen soil in clm 4 0 and are associated with soil hydraulic and thermal property schemes used while simulating freeze thaw cycles swenson et al 2012 chen et al 2018 fang et al 2016 fortunately accurate simulation of the coldest soil temperatures is not important to the goals of this study because as long as the surface soils are frozen there is neither infiltration nor overland runoff 3 3 stream temperature simulations 3 3 1 effects of resolving spatial heterogeneity in riparian vegetation the effects of resolving the spatial variability in riparian vegetation on simulated stream temperatures were evaluated by testing the model performance using different nested land use resolutions within model grid cells encompassing the streams and their riparian zones the sizes of the nested grids within the 1 1 km model grid cell were 60 m 60 m 90 90 m 250 250 m and 1000 1000 m the stream temperature comparisons were performed at eight observational sites when observed stream temperature data are available during the simulation period locations in fig 1 all comparisons are shown at hourly scales except for the kalamazoo river station near allegan usgs 04107850 for which only daily average temperatures were available the performance metrics for the tests are tabulated in table 1 simulations with land use resolutions of 60 and 90 m show similar performance and are generally better than model performance based on resolutions of 250 and 1000 m at the marshall site 90 m showed the best performance among the four test cases three observation sites were selected to present the performance difference fig 6 the land cover pfts and percentages for the stream segments where the three observational sites are located are shown in fig 7 as the resolution of the nested grids used to represent land cover within a model grid cell changes the dominant land cover fractions within the model grid cell change resulting in changes in simulated stream temperature due to changes in riparian climate for example at the allegan site usgs 04107850 deciduous broadleaf is the most dominant riparian land cover for all the four resolutions tested open water fractions for 60 and 90 m resolution riparian land use datasets exceeded the minimum threshold of 20 while open water fractions with resolutions of 250 and 1000 m are estimated as the default 20 as a result the summer water temperature at this site was underestimated using 250 and 1000 m riparian land cover resolutions in contrast at the spring brook site the summer temperature was overestimated using land cover information from 250 and 1000 m nested grids which could be explained by the relatively small percentage of deciduous broadleaf and thus the relatively small summer shading effect using 250 and 1000 m riparian land cover at the bear creek site dominant land cover types and percentages for all four spatial resolutions are almost the same accordingly the simulated stream temperature results did not show significant differences in light of these results all subsequent simulations of stream temperature presented in the paper are based on the optimum resolution of 90 m 90 m for resampling the land cover information within a model grid cell of 1 km 1 km 3 3 2 comparisons with observed stream temperature data comparisons of simulated and observed stream temperature for the eight observation sites are shown in fig 8 for the observation sites at indian creek fig 8f and marshall fig 8g simulated stream temperature results show negative temperature values during some days in winter while the observed temperature remains constant around 0 c which is similar to the discrepancy in soil temperature comparisons presented earlier this is probably due to overestimation of subzero soil temperatures in winter as noted earlier which also influence stream temperatures via exchange fluxes in addition the high turbulence of flowing water tends to prevent freezing mohseni and stefan 1999 although friction heat flux due to fluid friction at the river bed and the banks is included in the modeling detailed effects of turbulence were not explicitly modeled previous research suggested that neglecting the energy associated with snowmelt could impact stream temperature simulations caissie et al 2007 although the paws model via clm takes the energy of snowmelt into consideration as described in qiu et al 2019a freezing and thawing of stream ice are not explicitly simulated future efforts will focus on improving the representations of stream ice and phase change processes at the silver creek site the winter temperature is underestimated by the model from december 2008 to february 2009 fig 8b underestimated warm heat fluxes from the subsurface during winter periods may be responsible for this mismatch at the schnable brook site the amplitude of diurnal temperature fluctuations is overestimated by the model which may be due to inaccurate representation of stream geometry and or inaccurate stream discharge outputs fig 8d diurnal stream temperature fluctuations are found to be sensitive to stream geometries width and depth e g macdonald et al 2014 the stream width values were estimated from reported values wesley 2005 and google earth which may have introduced uncertainties into the stream width representation in addition stream discharge influences the stream heat capacity and the advective heat fluxes although the stream discharges were calibrated to several usgs gauges it is possible for mismatches to exist between simulated discharge and actual discharge in uncalibrated tributaries due to a combination of factors these factors may include inaccurate representation of the heterogeneities in stream properties such as stream depths and widths as well as processes not simulated such as tile drains at the marshall site the summer temperature of 2008 is slightly underestimated by the model fig 8g in contrast at the indian creek site the summer temperature of 2009 is slightly overestimated fig 8f possible explanations for these discrepancies in summer temperatures could include the inaccurate estimation of vegetation shading effects and or the heat fluxes from the subsurface moreover the assumption of a minimum 20 of water fraction within the grid cell may not exactly describe the reality for example forest streams may be fully shaded by broadleaf trees in summer it should also be noted that the observed data are point measurements while the model results represent average values of temperature in a 1 km stream segment discrepancies could occur if the vegetation covers around the sampled points are significantly different from the average cover along the 1 km stream segment despite these general observations and caveats a good overall agreement is noted between observations and model results fig 8 3 3 3 seasonal heat budgets average seasonal heat flux budgets during the simulation period were calculated at the temperature measurement sites fig 9 for all the eight sites the dominant heat source is net radiation and the primary heat sink is latent heat which is consistent with the literature e g macdonald et al 2014 leach and moore 2010 sensible heat flux is a heat sink in spring autumn and winter while it shifts to a heat source in summer heat flux from the subsurface is an important component that switches from a source in spring and winter to a sink in summer and fall during the simulation period therefore subsurface heat fluxes serve as a heat buffer to cool down the high summer temperatures and warm up the cold winter temperatures this underscores the importance of investigating the connections between surface water and groundwater temperatures and their co evolving responses in a warming climate kurylyk et al 2013 friction heat flux and snowmelt heat flux occupy a small portion of the heat budget and show relatively less impact on the stream thermal regimes in this study given the similar latitudes of the eight sampling sites incoming solar radiation and longwave radiation fluxes can be expected to be similar for all sites however distinct seasonal net radiation heat fluxes are shown for the eight sampling sites this shows the significant role the vegetation shading effect plays in altering the net radiation fluxes received by the stream surface in different reaches fig 10 shows average spatially distributed stream temperatures for the krw during the simulation period for summer fig 10a and winter fig 10b respectively five distinct locations in the watershed are marked using rectangular boxes for further examination of the spatial patterns at location 1 the two highlighted stream segments are connected to several lakes which are less affected by the vegetation shading effect thus the summer temperature are relatively high similarly at location 2 where the riparian land cover is dominated by urban and open land high summer temperatures occur as the vegetation shading effect becomes less important in contrast location 3 shows relatively cool summer temperatures and low winter temperatures which are primarily due to a higher fraction of riparian forest broadleaf deciduous the spring brook monitoring site is located at location 4 which shows relatively low summer temperatures and relatively warm winter temperatures the higher subsurface heat flux contributions at the site stabilize the temperatures in tributaries of location 4 see also fig 9 in contrast at location 5 simulated results show relatively high temperatures in summer and low temperatures in winter which can be attributed to the relatively small subsurface heat flux contributions 3 3 4 stream temperature responses to potential deforestation to evaluate the potential effects of deforestation on high summer temperatures a modeling scenario was conducted by replacing 10 of the deciduous broadleaf forest with c3 grass for river segments that contained a riparian land cover of more than 10 deciduous broadleaf forest this change is only incorporated into calculations of stream incoming radiation heat fluxes while preserving calculations of other hydrologic variables such as river discharge and et a map of the june july average daily stream temperature difference simulated temperature from this scenario minus the baseline temperature is shown in fig 11 as expected small and lower order usually headwater streams are more sensitive to potential deforestation effects due to their relatively small heat capacities in comparison with large and higher order rivers the extreme temperature increase could reach 6 7 c three example stream segments that initially have more than 10 riparian deciduous broadleaf forest are highlighted to understand the temperature changes under the deforestation scenario marked as boxes 1 3 in fig 11 results for three relevant hydrologic properties the average stream width average stream depth and the baseflow index bfi which is the ratio of groundwater contribution to total stream discharge volume during june july are shown in table 2 segment 1 shows the highest temperature increase among the three segments it has moderate stream width and depth values but the lowest bfi values lacking the buffering effect from cooler groundwater this stream segment is most vulnerable to potential deforestation segment 2 is one of the headwater streams of the kalamazoo river and has a bfi of more than half during june july however the small stream size increased its sensitivity to potential deforestation and as a result the temperature increased by 4 4 5 c segment 3 shows the least temperature increase a relatively high bfi value and stream size render this stream least sensitive to potential deforestation effects in these scenarios the mean annual air temperature was used as the groundwater temperature as explained earlier however shallow groundwater temperatures could respond to short term air temperature and land surface temperature changes kurylyk et al 2013 which may in turn influence surface water temperatures ultimately the groundwater temperature in the aquifers that supply much of the stream discharge will respond to the warming climate though likely over decadal time scales in this watershed results of this work indicate the possibility to extend the application of the developed model to evaluate the coevolving effects of climate and land cover changes on stream temperature regimes which will be increasingly important to identify effective strategies for fisheries and aquatic ecosystem management 4 conclusions this study extended the paws clm model using a newly developed stream temperature module applying it to a 5200 km2 mixed land use watershed publicly available spatial data sets were used the optimal spatial resolution for representing riparian vegetation effects was identified and process based simulations were validated using field measurements of soil and stream water temperatures the model was applied to quantitively evaluate the effects of riparian vegetation on the stream temperatures accounting for land use and cover and seasonal vegetation phenology the model results suggested overall satisfactory performance considering several sources of uncertainties the vegetation effects are best represented by upscaling the land use information with a grid resolution of 90 m 90 m while using 1 km 1 km model grid cells to simulate the stream discharge and temperature model results based on the potential

5938,little is known about water rock interaction related to deeper groundwater flows along tectonic discontinuities in the arctic glacial catchments therefore we analyzed oxygen and sulfur isotope compositions Œ¥18o Œ¥34s of dissolved sulfate so4 2 to better understand this process in groundwater from mineral and thermal springs and subglacial outflows of southern spitsbergen our results show that coupled Œ¥18o Œ¥34s of so4 2 is a useful measure of groundwater provenance and its relation to water rock interaction along flow paths in different lithologies in the studied area groundwater rock interaction with carbonate and crystalline rocks contributes two different sources of sulfide derived so4 2 with distinctive isotope compositions and leaves similar isotopic signature as in shallow surface environment e g proglacial lakes and streams the sulfide derived so4 2 from paleozoic carbonates has lower Œ¥34s 5 and higher Œ¥18o 5 compared to higher Œ¥34s 10 to 15 and more negative Œ¥18o 10 in the precambrian crystalline rocks minor contributions of so4 2 are from sea spray conversely direct inflows of seawater appear to be negligible if any moreover the more negative Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o values 85 to 70 and 12 to 9 respectively suggest that majority of the studied groundwater and surface water is from melting of snow ice formed in fall winter months compared to lower contributions from spring summer precipitation with higher Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o 65 to 55 and 8 to 6 interestingly the water soluble so4 2 from the antarctic soils with high Œ¥34s 12 to 16 and negative Œ¥18o 15 to 5 is remarkably similar to the sulfide derived so4 2 from the precambrian crystalline rocks analyzed by us in southern spitsbergen this implies that sulfide oxidation might be a widespread process in polar environments even under extremely dry conditions as in antarctica keywords sulfate isotopes groundwater polar 1 introduction polar hydrological studies are useful to evaluate the effects of climate warming induced by greenhouse gas emission turner and marshall 2011 nowak and hodson 2013 nilsson et al 2015 this is mainly because current increases of glacial melting in the arctic have been directly linked to a rise of global temperatures lang et al 2015 hansen et al 2016 malecki 2016 zemp et al 2019 additionally these studies are helpful to understand main water flow paths in surface and subsurface glacial environment grabczak and r√≥zkowski 1984 haldorsen et al 1997 banks et al 1998 1999 recent ice melting has also led to exposure of large areas in glacier catchments leading to increases of chemical denudation rates due to geochemical reactions of melt waters with fresh bedrock material e g wadham et al 2001 2007 stachnik et al 2019 consequently numerous studies have focused on chemical and isotopic compositions of surface water and shallow groundwater in the proglacial zone and subglacial outflows at the terminus grabczak and r√≥≈ºkowski 1984 wadham et al 1998 2000 cooper et al 2002 kristiansen et al 2012 yde et al 2012 szynkiewicz et al 2013 marszalek and gorniak 2017 in contrast less attention has been on deeper groundwater flow paths in regional scale and in intra or subpermafrost zone lauritzen and bottrell 1994 banks et al 1998 1999 hammer et al 2005 while seawater spray and sulfide oxidation have been important solute sources in shallow glacial environment and subglacial outflows tranter et al 1993 wadham et al 2001 tranter 2003 yde et al 2012 kwasniak kominek et al 2016 torres et al 2017 little is known whether the same sources are important constituents of deeper groundwater issuing from main tectonic discontinuities natural variations of stable isotopes in water are useful environmental tracers for determining the origin of groundwater in hydrological system e g clark and fritz 1997 in particular sulfur and oxygen isotope compositions Œ¥34s Œ¥18o of dissolved sulfate so4 2 have been powerful tracers for distinguishing its sources and oxidation mechanisms during water rock interaction along the flow paths e g krouse and grinenko 1991 sulfide oxidation can be sustained under anoxic conditions in deeper flows of glacial systems with possible effects on isotope composition of dissolved so4 2 e g bottrell and tranter 2002 wadham et al 2007 hindshaw et al 2016 however previous studies mainly focused on measuring the isotope compositions of so4 2 in localized areas usually small glacial catchments and their proglacial zones bottrell and tranter 2002 wadham et al 2004 2007 szynkiewicz et al 2013 ansari 2016 conversely regional comparisons between isotopic compositions and deeper groundwater flows are lacking the main goal of our study was to test whether coupled Œ¥18o Œ¥34s of so4 2 are useful to characterize the groundwater provenance and its relation to water rock interaction along deeper groundwater flow paths in southern spitsbergen one of the main islands in svalbard archipelago fig 1 particularly we focused on the groundwater with flow paths within and below the permafrost issuing as thermal and mineral springs we also used isotope composition of groundwater Œ¥2h Œ¥18o as additional tracers of main flow paths further we report new results for water isotope composition and Œ¥18o of dissolved so4 2 for the surface water shallow groundwater and subglacial outflows of the werenskioldbreen proglacial zone in southern spitsbergen in previous study szynkiewicz et al 2013 we only characterized the Œ¥34s of the proglacial bedrock surface water and subglacial outflows in the werenskioldbreen catchment which allowed for linking main fluxes of aqueous so4 2 to sulfide oxidation however it was difficult to assess contributions of sea spray into the werenskioldbreen proglacial waters because the Œ¥34s of bedrock sulfides 10 to 15 only slightly differs from the seawater so4 2 21 our new Œ¥18o results for both the dissolved so4 2 and proglacial waters in the werenskioldbreen allow for better distinction between so4 2 fluxes from sulfide weathering and sea spray and deeper groundwater characterized by longer flow paths within glacier catchment further we were able to make regional comparisons of groundwater provenances between the werenkioldbreen meltwaters and the thermal and mineral springs across southern spitsbergen using sulfur and oxygen isotope compositions 2 study area the study area is located in southern spitsbergen in the hornsund fiord and s√∂rkappland region the land of southern cape fig 1 their landscapes are dominated by several mountain ranges arranged as meridional chains and surrounded by coastal lowlands formed from uplifted sea terraces zwolinski et al 2013 a few major geologic units are present in spitsbergen quaternary deposits tertiary basin sediments carboniferous through cretaceous platform sedimentary sequences devonian basin sediments and proterozoic metamorphic basement rocks harland 1997 the tectonic history of the studied area is dated back to the precambrian and reflected in a large number of faults and discontinuities that significantly influence the groundwater flow paths particularly those of deeper subsurface origin in southern spitsbergen groundwater flowing above the permafrost can be defined as a shallow infiltration zone whereas groundwater within and below the permafrost as an intermediate zone e g olichwer and tarka 2018 additionally deep flows are related to tectonic discontinuities where groundwater from shallow and intermediate depths may infiltrate much deeper into subsurface 1500 m and ascend back to the surface as thermal and thermo mineral springs haldorsen et al 1996 krawczyk 1996 lauritzen 1996 banks et al 1998 olichwer et al 2013 olichwer and tarka 2018 the studied springs in the northern part of the study area e g hornsund fiord fig 1 are associated with the early proterozoic and paleozoic metamorphic rocks and quaternary deposits they are comprised of highly metamorphosed rocks such as paragneisses mica schists with marbles quartzites schists amphibolites greenschists gneisses conglomerates limestones and dolostones birkenmajer 1990a czerny et al 1993 in the coastal zone these crystalline rocks are significantly weathered and covered by younger deposits enriched in secondary alteration minerals high concentrations of sulfide minerals occur as massive ores and disseminations in quartz carbonate veins which are a result of metamorphic processes in the precambrian basic and acidic volcanic rocks czerny et al 1992 for instance these sulfides are commonly found in the proglacial deposits of the werenskioldbreen catchment in the southern part of research area e g s√∂rkappland the studied springs occur in the ordovician carbonate limestone and carboniferous through jurassic sedimentary rocks sandstone shale mudstone limestone dolomite thin layers of evaporites are also locally present in the carboniferous and permina shale dineley 1958 moreover the largest limestone shore belt of southern spitsbergen extends into the s√∂rkappland area and is situated within several sea terraces which are a result of littoral karst pulina 1977 3 methods 3 1 field sampling the water samples from mineral and thermal springs were collected during the 19th summer 2006 scientific expeditions of the wroc≈Çaw university to horsund spitsbergen they were filtered into polyethylene bottles that were rinsed with the filtered water prior to collection the 0 45 Œºm nylon filters were used for filtration and dissolved so4 2 was later precipitated as baso4 at a field station a few hours after collection dry samples of baso4 were kept in vials for Œ¥34s and Œ¥18o analyses additional portion of water was kept in polyethylene bottles for Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o analyses the sampled spring water can be divided into three main groups relative to the depth of groundwater flow paths after olichwer and tarka 2018 note that we followed the regional names of these springs for future geochemical comparisons 1 shallow groundwater in the suprapermafrost zone brattegg proglacial zone of werenskioldbreen a fresh

high discharge issuing from a cave adjacent to the shoreline olsok a karst spring of thermal and mineral water with a strong hydrogen sulfide odor located near the moraine of the olsokbreen along the transition zone between crystalline carbonate and younger sedimentary rocks its higher salinity mainly na and cl might be a result of deep inflow of subpermafrost thermal brine lauritzen and botrell 1994 with negligible input if any from modern seawater olichwer and tarka 2018 collection of water samples from the proglacial zone of werenskioldbreen took place in summer 2008 the methods of field sampling and precipitation of baso4 were similar as for the mineral and thermal springs collected in summer 2006 the results of chemical composition and Œ¥34s of so4 2 for werenskioldbreen were previously discussed by szynkiewicz et al 2013 conversely in this paper we present new results for Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o of proglacial waters and Œ¥18o of so4 2 which were not possible in 2008 3 2 laboratory analysis the dissolved so4 2 in groundwater was precipitated as barium sulfate baso4 for sulfur and oxygen isotope analysis by reaction with 10 20 ml of 10 barium chloride bacl2 after rinsing with dionized water baso4 was dried at 60 c the Œ¥34s of baso4 was determined using an ea1110 elemental analyzer coupled to a finnigan mat 252 isotope ratio mass spectrometer via a conflo ii split interface in a stable isotope research facility at indiana university the Œ¥18o of baso4 was measured using a thermo finnigan tc ea coupled with a thermo finnigan delta plus xl mass spectrometer in a stable isotope laboratory at university of tennessee sulfur and oxygen isotopic data are reported in units of per mil with respect to vienna ca√±on diablo troilite v cdt and vienna standard mean ocean water v smow analytical reproducibility was better than 0 3 based on replicate measurements hydrogen and oxygen isotope compositions of water samples were analyzed using a hydrogen device and gas bench respectively coupled to a thermo finnigan delta plus xp mass spectrometer located in indiana university hydrogen and oxygen isotopic data are reported with respect to vienna standard mean ocean water v smow analytical reproducibility was better than 1 for Œ¥2h and 0 2 for Œ¥18o based on replicate measurements 4 results and discussion 4 1 sources of surface water and groundwater isotope compositions Œ¥2h Œ¥18o of surface water and groundwater have been widely used to understand sources of meteoric precipitation and mixing processes in hydrological system e g gat 1996 this is mainly because of distinctive isotopic compositions of continental meteoric water compared to seawater corresponding to changes in air temperature topography and altitude when air masses move from the equator to the poles gat 1996 in our study the Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o of the mineral and thermal springs and proglacial waters of the werenskioldbreen tables 1 2 were closely aligned to a local meteoric water line fig 2 suggesting meteoric precipitation as a main source in the hydrological system of southern spitsbergen the observed variations of Œ¥18o 12 to 6 were within the range of regional precipitation 15 to 5 recorded for 1951 2001 in svalbard archipelago divine et al 2011 generally there were no clear relationships between isotopic compositions and spatial distributions of the studied mineral and thermal springs e g from north to south table 1 however two distinctive groups of surface water and groundwater are apparent on fig 2 implying different water masses e g precipitation types in the hydrological system of the studied sites seasonal effects are known to affect isotopic composition of local precipitation mainly due to seasonal variations of temperature e g gat 1996 for example in svalbard higher Œ¥18o values of 10 to 5 are typical in the spring summer precipitation compared to more negative values of 15 to 8 in the fall winter precipitation divine et al 2011 interestingly this seasonal pattern for the Œ¥18o of local precipitation matches the measured Œ¥18o of two water groups in our studied sites fig 2 the most influenced locations by the spring summer precipitation were one thermal karst spring bj√∏rnbein discharging to the land surface through tectonic discontinuities krawczyk 1996 olichwer and tarka 2018 as well as lakes no 4 13 18 and shallow groundwater piezometer of the werenskioldbreen proglacial zone szynkiewicz et al 2013 in other locations the Œ¥18o values were more negative pointing to the melting of snow or ice most likely derived by winter precipitation this included majority of the mineral thermal springs and subglacial outflows at the werenskioldbreen terminus originating from ice melting at the base of the glacier 4 2 sources of so4 2 in mineral thermal springs and proglacial waters chemical weathering induced by sulfide oxidation has been identified in many glacial melt waters of svalbard archipelago e g tranter et al 2002 wynn et al 2006 ansari 2016 sulfuric acid formed during sulfide oxidation is a primary factor enhancing mineral dissolution in glacier catchments with elevated sulfides in the bedrock e g cooper et al 2002 ansari 2016 this is particularly the case for the proglacial waters of werenskioldbreen szynkiewicz et al 2013 which interact with the precambrian crystalline bedrock abundant in sulfide rich quartz carbonate veins wojciechowski 1964 kieres and piestrzy≈Ñski 1992 consistent with previous investigation in the werenskioldbreen szynkiewicz et al 2013 the majority of mineral and thermal springs sampled for this study were controlled by sulfuric acid dissolution based on positive relationship between ca2 mg2 and so4 2 concentrations fig 3 this shows that sulfide oxidation has a strong regional control on chemical composition of shallow and deeper groundwater in spitsbergen only three karst springs raud b bj√∏rnbein and olsok had the concentrations of ca2 mg2 and so4 2 pointing to carbonic acid dissolution fig 3 a common weathering pathway in hydrological systems controlled by dissolution of carbon dioxide of atmospheric and or biologic origin e g berner and berner 2012 we infer that carbonic acid dissolution must be more dominant in the carbonate bedrock probably due to a lack of sulfide rich veins which are more apparent in the precambrian crystalline rocks leszkiewicz 1982 krawczyk and pulina 1982 1991 krawczyk 1996 lauritzen 1996 in spitsbergen the Œ¥34s of dissolved so4 2 in proglacial waters has significantly higher values 8 to 15 szynkiewicz et al 2013 compared to typical sulfide mineralization in magmatic volcanic and sedimentary rocks 30 to 3 clark and fritz 1997 nevertheless this higher Œ¥34s of so4 2 is consistent with similar Œ¥34s of the bedrock sulfides present in the werenskioldbreen szynkiewicz et al 2013 and also in the lov√©nbreen catchment located further north ansari 2016 noteworthy we also measured distinctive negative Œ¥18o of so4 2 13 to 5 in all mineral thermal springs and proglacial waters of the werenskioldbreen fig 4 in general they were similar to the Œ¥18o of surface water and groundwater 12 to 6 fig 5 and consistent with small oxygen isotope fractionations between so4 2 and water that accompany sulfide oxidation e g balci et al 2007 this further supports the notion that sulfide oxidation is a primary source of aqueous so4 2 in spitsbergen comparison of Œ¥34s versus Œ¥18o clearly shows that in addition to sulfide weathering seawater is another important source of so4 2 particularly in several mineral and thermal springs sampled in our study fig 4 the rasstupet karst spring located in a close proximity to the coast fig 1 is likely the most affected by seawater inputs because of Œ¥34s and Œ¥18o 21 0 and 8 1 being almost identical as in the coastal seawater 20 3 and 8 9 this is consistent with previously measured ratios of major ions in this spring similar to modern seawater leszkiewicz 1982 leszkiewicz et al 1982 olichwer et al 2013 in contrast other studied sites showed higher contributions of so4 2 from sulfide weathering fig 4 interestingly our results show that it is possible to distinguish between sulfide weathering in two main bedrock types of the studied area using isotope composition of so4 2 for example sulfide derived so4 2 associated with carbonate bedrock showed lower Œ¥34s 5 and higher Œ¥18o 5 compared to higher Œ¥34s 10 to 15 and more negative Œ¥18o 10 in the precambrian crystalline bedrock fig 4 conversely the isotope composition of so4 2 does not allow for differentiation between three main groundwater flow paths identified previously by olichwer and tarka 2018 for mineral and thermal springs within the supra intra and sub permafrost zones table 1 modern seawater has distinctive higher Œ¥18o values 0 8 in our study and higher Œ¥34s and Œ¥18o of so4 2 compared to meteoric precipitation and glacial meltwater figs 5 6 table 1 comparison of so4 2 isotope composition with Œ¥18o of water fig 5 shows that so4 2 contributions from seawater in southern spitsbergen are mainly from sea spray aerosols this is supported by negative trends between Œ¥34s and Œ¥18o of so4 2 versus Œ¥18o of mineral thermal springs and proglacial waters fig 5 in case of direct mixing with seawater the increases of Œ¥34s and Œ¥18o of so4 2 and Œ¥18o of water would be expected which does not appear in the studied samples lack of direct mixing with seawater is also supported by lowest so4 2 concentrations and negative Œ¥18o measured in the groundwater of the rasstupet karst spring with largest contributions of sea spray so4 2 as inferred from highest Œ¥34s and Œ¥18o values figs 5a and 6 4 3 mixing processes in glacier system because of distinctive isotopic compositions of sulfide and seawater derived so4 2 fig 4 they appear to be a useful tracer for understanding mixing of groundwater with different chemical composition within the glacier catchment for example the proglacial zone of the werenskioldbreen showed clear mixing relationships between sulfide derived so4 2 from two main bedrock lithologies e g paleozoic carbonates precambrian crystalline rocks and sea spray fig 4 noteworthy the Œ¥34s and Œ¥18o values of so4 2 in several subglacial outflows at the werenskiodbreen terminus no 1 14 28 were closely related to the paleozoic carbonates which are not present in the proglacial zone but are known to underlie the glacier in upstream locations therefore the strong isotope signature of carbonate sulfide derived so4 2 in these subglacial outflows fig 4 must reflect longer probably deeper groundwater flows in the werenskioldbreen catchment conversely other outflows no 10 showed isotopic composition similar to so4 2 from oxidation of sulfide rich veins in the precambrian crystalline rocks that are common in the proglacial zone suggesting shorter shallower groundwater flows wojciechowski 1964 the mineral and thermal springs showed similar relationships indicating that the coupled Œ¥18o and Œ¥34s of so4 2 are useful in distinguishing groundwater provenance and its relation to water rock interaction with two major lithologies in spitsbergen similar mixing relationships related to water rock interaction with two main lithologies of the studied area are also observed for the Œ¥34s versus cl so4 2 ratio fig 6b similarly the cl so4 2 ratios appear to be helpful in distinguishing differences in water rock interaction within the carbonate bedrock for example two thermal karst springs olsok and trollosen had significantly higher cl so4 2 ratios of 55 compared to the orvin and bj√∏rnbein springs with lower ratios of 1 2 and lower temperatures fig 6b the observed higher cl so4 2 ratios might be related to longer residence time higher temperatures and deeper flow paths in the carbonate formations these are known to change water chemistry toward a na cl type in non glaciated catchment lauritzen and bottrell 1994 banks et al 1998 hammer et al 2005 haldorsen et al 2009 thus justify the higher cl concentrations 800 2150 mg l in thermal karst springs olsok trollosen compared to lower concentrations 45 100 mg l in other springs 4 4 additional applications understanding so4 2 sources in the south pole in last two decades numerous independent chemical and isotopic studies have well documented that sulfide oxidation is a major weathering pathway and source of so4 2 in polar aquatic system of svalbard archipelago tranter et al 2002 cooper et al 2002 wynn et al 2006 szynkiewicz et al 2013 ansari 2016 this is consistent with our new isotopic results showing that this process is active on regional scale in both surface and subsurface environment of southern spitsbergen fig 4 remarkably similar relationships between Œ¥34s and Œ¥18o have been reported for the water leachable so4 2 in antarctic soils from dry valleys fig 7 because the Œ¥34s variation of the bedrock is poorly constrained in the south pole the unusually high Œ¥34s and very negative Œ¥18o of antarctic so4 2 have been a puzzle for researchers so far the linear positive relationships between Œ¥34s and Œ¥18o fig 7 have been explained by a mixing of varied solutes from atmospheric deposition sea spray methyldisulfides volcanic emission with unknown bedrock source bao and merchant 2006 the so4 2 sources from sulfide oxidation have not been taken into account because of more positive Œ¥34s values in the antarctic soils 12 to 16 compared to typical sulfide mineralization in magmatic volcanic and sedimentary rocks 30 to 3 clark and fritz 1997 interestingly our data from the water samples most affected by oxidation of sulfide rich veins in crystalline rocks of southern spitsbergen follow exactly the same mixing line as observed for the antarctic soils fig 7 this implies that sulfide oxidation might be a widespread process in polar environments even under extremely dry conditions such as in dry valleys of antarctica however coupled Œ¥18o Œ¥34s approach and identification of Œ¥34s in the bedrock are necessary for correct interpretation of so4 2 sources 5 conclusions the coupled Œ¥18o Œ¥34s of so4 2 are a useful measure of groundwater provenance in southern spitsbergen and distinctive in regional scale the so4 2 isotope composition of mineral thermal springs and proglacial waters are controlled by similar water rock interaction with two main bedrock lithologies the paleozoic carbonate and precambrian crystalline rocks main so4 2 contributions come from oxidation of sulfides and minor additions are from sea spray majority of surface water and groundwater are from melting of snow ice from fall winter months compared to lower contributions from spring summer precipitation direct inflows of seawater appear to be negligible if any additionally comparisons of so4 2 isotope composition with cl so4 2 ratios help to better distinguish water rock interaction in these two bedrock lithologies

5938,little is known about water rock interaction related to deeper groundwater flows along tectonic discontinuities in the arctic glacial catchments therefore we analyzed oxygen and sulfur isotope compositions Œ¥18o Œ¥34s of dissolved sulfate so4 2 to better understand this process in groundwater from mineral and thermal springs and subglacial outflows of southern spitsbergen our results show that coupled Œ¥18o Œ¥34s of so4 2 is a useful measure of groundwater provenance and its relation to water rock interaction along flow paths in different lithologies in the studied area groundwater rock interaction with carbonate and crystalline rocks contributes two different sources of sulfide derived so4 2 with distinctive isotope compositions and leaves similar isotopic signature as in shallow surface environment e g proglacial lakes and streams the sulfide derived so4 2 from paleozoic carbonates has lower Œ¥34s 5 and higher Œ¥18o 5 compared to higher Œ¥34s 10 to 15 and more negative Œ¥18o 10 in the precambrian crystalline rocks minor contributions of so4 2 are from sea spray conversely direct inflows of seawater appear to be negligible if any moreover the more negative Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o values 85 to 70 and 12 to 9 respectively suggest that majority of the studied groundwater and surface water is from melting of snow ice formed in fall winter months compared to lower contributions from spring summer precipitation with higher Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o 65 to 55 and 8 to 6 interestingly the water soluble so4 2 from the antarctic soils with high Œ¥34s 12 to 16 and negative Œ¥18o 15 to 5 is remarkably similar to the sulfide derived so4 2 from the precambrian crystalline rocks analyzed by us in southern spitsbergen this implies that sulfide oxidation might be a widespread process in polar environments even under extremely dry conditions as in antarctica keywords sulfate isotopes groundwater polar 1 introduction polar hydrological studies are useful to evaluate the effects of climate warming induced by greenhouse gas emission turner and marshall 2011 nowak and hodson 2013 nilsson et al 2015 this is mainly because current increases of glacial melting in the arctic have been directly linked to a rise of global temperatures lang et al 2015 hansen et al 2016 malecki 2016 zemp et al 2019 additionally these studies are helpful to understand main water flow paths in surface and subsurface glacial environment grabczak and r√≥zkowski 1984 haldorsen et al 1997 banks et al 1998 1999 recent ice melting has also led to exposure of large areas in glacier catchments leading to increases of chemical denudation rates due to geochemical reactions of melt waters with fresh bedrock material e g wadham et al 2001 2007 stachnik et al 2019 consequently numerous studies have focused on chemical and isotopic compositions of surface water and shallow groundwater in the proglacial zone and subglacial outflows at the terminus grabczak and r√≥≈ºkowski 1984 wadham et al 1998 2000 cooper et al 2002 kristiansen et al 2012 yde et al 2012 szynkiewicz et al 2013 marszalek and gorniak 2017 in contrast less attention has been on deeper groundwater flow paths in regional scale and in intra or subpermafrost zone lauritzen and bottrell 1994 banks et al 1998 1999 hammer et al 2005 while seawater spray and sulfide oxidation have been important solute sources in shallow glacial environment and subglacial outflows tranter et al 1993 wadham et al 2001 tranter 2003 yde et al 2012 kwasniak kominek et al 2016 torres et al 2017 little is known whether the same sources are important constituents of deeper groundwater issuing from main tectonic discontinuities natural variations of stable isotopes in water are useful environmental tracers for determining the origin of groundwater in hydrological system e g clark and fritz 1997 in particular sulfur and oxygen isotope compositions Œ¥34s Œ¥18o of dissolved sulfate so4 2 have been powerful tracers for distinguishing its sources and oxidation mechanisms during water rock interaction along the flow paths e g krouse and grinenko 1991 sulfide oxidation can be sustained under anoxic conditions in deeper flows of glacial systems with possible effects on isotope composition of dissolved so4 2 e g bottrell and tranter 2002 wadham et al 2007 hindshaw et al 2016 however previous studies mainly focused on measuring the isotope compositions of so4 2 in localized areas usually small glacial catchments and their proglacial zones bottrell and tranter 2002 wadham et al 2004 2007 szynkiewicz et al 2013 ansari 2016 conversely regional comparisons between isotopic compositions and deeper groundwater flows are lacking the main goal of our study was to test whether coupled Œ¥18o Œ¥34s of so4 2 are useful to characterize the groundwater provenance and its relation to water rock interaction along deeper groundwater flow paths in southern spitsbergen one of the main islands in svalbard archipelago fig 1 particularly we focused on the groundwater with flow paths within and below the permafrost issuing as thermal and mineral springs we also used isotope composition of groundwater Œ¥2h Œ¥18o as additional tracers of main flow paths further we report new results for water isotope composition and Œ¥18o of dissolved so4 2 for the surface water shallow groundwater and subglacial outflows of the werenskioldbreen proglacial zone in southern spitsbergen in previous study szynkiewicz et al 2013 we only characterized the Œ¥34s of the proglacial bedrock surface water and subglacial outflows in the werenskioldbreen catchment which allowed for linking main fluxes of aqueous so4 2 to sulfide oxidation however it was difficult to assess contributions of sea spray into the werenskioldbreen proglacial waters because the Œ¥34s of bedrock sulfides 10 to 15 only slightly differs from the seawater so4 2 21 our new Œ¥18o results for both the dissolved so4 2 and proglacial waters in the werenskioldbreen allow for better distinction between so4 2 fluxes from sulfide weathering and sea spray and deeper groundwater characterized by longer flow paths within glacier catchment further we were able to make regional comparisons of groundwater provenances between the werenkioldbreen meltwaters and the thermal and mineral springs across southern spitsbergen using sulfur and oxygen isotope compositions 2 study area the study area is located in southern spitsbergen in the hornsund fiord and s√∂rkappland region the land of southern cape fig 1 their landscapes are dominated by several mountain ranges arranged as meridional chains and surrounded by coastal lowlands formed from uplifted sea terraces zwolinski et al 2013 a few major geologic units are present in spitsbergen quaternary deposits tertiary basin sediments carboniferous through cretaceous platform sedimentary sequences devonian basin sediments and proterozoic metamorphic basement rocks harland 1997 the tectonic history of the studied area is dated back to the precambrian and reflected in a large number of faults and discontinuities that significantly influence the groundwater flow paths particularly those of deeper subsurface origin in southern spitsbergen groundwater flowing above the permafrost can be defined as a shallow infiltration zone whereas groundwater within and below the permafrost as an intermediate zone e g olichwer and tarka 2018 additionally deep flows are related to tectonic discontinuities where groundwater from shallow and intermediate depths may infiltrate much deeper into subsurface 1500 m and ascend back to the surface as thermal and thermo mineral springs haldorsen et al 1996 krawczyk 1996 lauritzen 1996 banks et al 1998 olichwer et al 2013 olichwer and tarka 2018 the studied springs in the northern part of the study area e g hornsund fiord fig 1 are associated with the early proterozoic and paleozoic metamorphic rocks and quaternary deposits they are comprised of highly metamorphosed rocks such as paragneisses mica schists with marbles quartzites schists amphibolites greenschists gneisses conglomerates limestones and dolostones birkenmajer 1990a czerny et al 1993 in the coastal zone these crystalline rocks are significantly weathered and covered by younger deposits enriched in secondary alteration minerals high concentrations of sulfide minerals occur as massive ores and disseminations in quartz carbonate veins which are a result of metamorphic processes in the precambrian basic and acidic volcanic rocks czerny et al 1992 for instance these sulfides are commonly found in the proglacial deposits of the werenskioldbreen catchment in the southern part of research area e g s√∂rkappland the studied springs occur in the ordovician carbonate limestone and carboniferous through jurassic sedimentary rocks sandstone shale mudstone limestone dolomite thin layers of evaporites are also locally present in the carboniferous and permina shale dineley 1958 moreover the largest limestone shore belt of southern spitsbergen extends into the s√∂rkappland area and is situated within several sea terraces which are a result of littoral karst pulina 1977 3 methods 3 1 field sampling the water samples from mineral and thermal springs were collected during the 19th summer 2006 scientific expeditions of the wroc≈Çaw university to horsund spitsbergen they were filtered into polyethylene bottles that were rinsed with the filtered water prior to collection the 0 45 Œºm nylon filters were used for filtration and dissolved so4 2 was later precipitated as baso4 at a field station a few hours after collection dry samples of baso4 were kept in vials for Œ¥34s and Œ¥18o analyses additional portion of water was kept in polyethylene bottles for Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o analyses the sampled spring water can be divided into three main groups relative to the depth of groundwater flow paths after olichwer and tarka 2018 note that we followed the regional names of these springs for future geochemical comparisons 1 shallow groundwater in the suprapermafrost zone brattegg proglacial zone of werenskioldbreen a fresh water spring sourced by permafrost melting at the foot of frontal moraine of the werenskioldbreen issuing from a rock rubble containing amphibolites mica schists quarzites in the brattegg river valley

high discharge issuing from a cave adjacent to the shoreline olsok a karst spring of thermal and mineral water with a strong hydrogen sulfide odor located near the moraine of the olsokbreen along the transition zone between crystalline carbonate and younger sedimentary rocks its higher salinity mainly na and cl might be a result of deep inflow of subpermafrost thermal brine lauritzen and botrell 1994 with negligible input if any from modern seawater olichwer and tarka 2018 collection of water samples from the proglacial zone of werenskioldbreen took place in summer 2008 the methods of field sampling and precipitation of baso4 were similar as for the mineral and thermal springs collected in summer 2006 the results of chemical composition and Œ¥34s of so4 2 for werenskioldbreen were previously discussed by szynkiewicz et al 2013 conversely in this paper we present new results for Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o of proglacial waters and Œ¥18o of so4 2 which were not possible in 2008 3 2 laboratory analysis the dissolved so4 2 in groundwater was precipitated as barium sulfate baso4 for sulfur and oxygen isotope analysis by reaction with 10 20 ml of 10 barium chloride bacl2 after rinsing with dionized water baso4 was dried at 60 c the Œ¥34s of baso4 was determined using an ea1110 elemental analyzer coupled to a finnigan mat 252 isotope ratio mass spectrometer via a conflo ii split interface in a stable isotope research facility at indiana university the Œ¥18o of baso4 was measured using a thermo finnigan tc ea coupled with a thermo finnigan delta plus xl mass spectrometer in a stable isotope laboratory at university of tennessee sulfur and oxygen isotopic data are reported in units of per mil with respect to vienna ca√±on diablo troilite v cdt and vienna standard mean ocean water v smow analytical reproducibility was better than 0 3 based on replicate measurements hydrogen and oxygen isotope compositions of water samples were analyzed using a hydrogen device and gas bench respectively coupled to a thermo finnigan delta plus xp mass spectrometer located in indiana university hydrogen and oxygen isotopic data are reported with respect to vienna standard mean ocean water v smow analytical reproducibility was better than 1 for Œ¥2h and 0 2 for Œ¥18o based on replicate measurements 4 results and discussion 4 1 sources of surface water and groundwater isotope compositions Œ¥2h Œ¥18o of surface water and groundwater have been widely used to understand sources of meteoric precipitation and mixing processes in hydrological system e g gat 1996 this is mainly because of distinctive isotopic compositions of continental meteoric water compared to seawater corresponding to changes in air temperature topography and altitude when air masses move from the equator to the poles gat 1996 in our study the Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o of the mineral and thermal springs and proglacial waters of the werenskioldbreen tables 1 2 were closely aligned to a local meteoric water line fig 2 suggesting meteoric precipitation as a main source in the hydrological system of southern spitsbergen the observed variations of Œ¥18o 12 to 6 were within the range of regional precipitation 15 to 5 recorded for 1951 2001 in svalbard archipelago divine et al 2011 generally there were no clear relationships between isotopic compositions and spatial distributions of the studied mineral and thermal springs e g from north to south table 1 however two distinctive groups of surface water and groundwater are apparent on fig 2 implying different water masses e g precipitation types in the hydrological system of the studied sites seasonal effects are known to affect isotopic composition of local precipitation mainly due to seasonal variations of temperature e g gat 1996 for example in svalbard higher Œ¥18o values of 10 to 5 are typical in the spring summer precipitation compared to more negative values of 15 to 8 in the fall winter precipitation divine et al 2011 interestingly this seasonal pattern for the Œ¥18o of local precipitation matches the measured Œ¥18o of two water groups in our studied sites fig 2 the most influenced locations by the spring summer precipitation were one thermal karst spring bj√∏rnbein discharging to the land surface through tectonic discontinuities krawczyk 1996 olichwer and tarka 2018 as well as lakes no 4 13 18 and shallow groundwater piezometer of the werenskioldbreen proglacial zone szynkiewicz et al 2013 in other locations the Œ¥18o values were more negative pointing to the melting of snow or ice most likely derived by winter precipitation this included majority of the mineral thermal springs and subglacial outflows at the werenskioldbreen terminus originating from ice melting at the base of the glacier 4 2 sources of so4 2 in mineral thermal springs and proglacial waters chemical weathering induced by sulfide oxidation has been identified in many glacial melt waters of svalbard archipelago e g tranter et al 2002 wynn et al 2006 ansari 2016 sulfuric acid formed during sulfide oxidation is a primary factor enhancing mineral dissolution in glacier catchments with elevated sulfides in the bedrock e g cooper et al 2002 ansari 2016 this is particularly the case for the proglacial waters of werenskioldbreen szynkiewicz et al 2013 which interact with the precambrian crystalline bedrock abundant in sulfide rich quartz carbonate veins wojciechowski 1964 kieres and piestrzy≈Ñski 1992 consistent with previous investigation in the werenskioldbreen szynkiewicz et al 2013 the majority of mineral and thermal springs sampled for this study were controlled by sulfuric acid dissolution based on positive relationship between ca2 mg2 and so4 2 concentrations fig 3 this shows that sulfide oxidation has a strong regional control on chemical composition of shallow and deeper groundwater in spitsbergen only three karst springs raud b bj√∏rnbein and olsok had the concentrations of ca2 mg2 and so4 2 pointing to carbonic acid dissolution fig 3 a common weathering pathway in hydrological systems controlled by dissolution of carbon dioxide of atmospheric and or biologic origin e g berner and berner 2012 we infer that carbonic acid dissolution must be more dominant in the carbonate bedrock probably due to a lack of sulfide rich veins which are more apparent in the precambrian crystalline rocks leszkiewicz 1982 krawczyk and pulina 1982 1991 krawczyk 1996 lauritzen 1996 in spitsbergen the Œ¥34s of dissolved so4 2 in proglacial waters has significantly higher values 8 to 15 szynkiewicz et al 2013 compared to typical sulfide mineralization in magmatic volcanic and sedimentary rocks 30 to 3 clark and fritz 1997 nevertheless this higher Œ¥34s of so4 2 is consistent with similar Œ¥34s of the bedrock sulfides present in the werenskioldbreen szynkiewicz et al 2013 and also in the lov√©nbreen catchment located further north ansari 2016 noteworthy we also measured distinctive negative Œ¥18o of so4 2 13 to 5 in all mineral thermal springs and proglacial waters of the werenskioldbreen fig 4 in general they were similar to the Œ¥18o of surface water and groundwater 12 to 6 fig 5 and consistent with small oxygen isotope fractionations between so4 2 and water that accompany sulfide oxidation e g balci et al 2007 this further supports the notion that sulfide oxidation is a primary source of aqueous so4 2 in spitsbergen comparison of Œ¥34s versus Œ¥18o clearly shows that in addition to sulfide weathering seawater is another important source of so4 2 particularly in several mineral and thermal springs sampled in our study fig 4 the rasstupet karst spring located in a close proximity to the coast fig 1 is likely the most affected by seawater inputs because of Œ¥34s and Œ¥18o 21 0 and 8 1 being almost identical as in the coastal seawater 20 3 and 8 9 this is consistent with previously measured ratios of major ions in this spring similar to modern seawater leszkiewicz 1982 leszkiewicz et al 1982 olichwer et al 2013 in contrast other studied sites showed higher contributions of so4 2 from sulfide weathering fig 4 interestingly our results show that it is possible to distinguish between sulfide weathering in two main bedrock types of the studied area using isotope composition of so4 2 for example sulfide derived so4 2 associated with carbonate bedrock showed lower Œ¥34s 5 and higher Œ¥18o 5 compared to higher Œ¥34s 10 to 15 and more negative Œ¥18o 10 in the precambrian crystalline bedrock fig 4 conversely the isotope composition of so4 2 does not allow for differentiation between three main groundwater flow paths identified previously by olichwer and tarka 2018 for mineral and thermal springs within the supra intra and sub permafrost zones table 1 modern seawater has distinctive higher Œ¥18o values 0 8 in our study and higher Œ¥34s and Œ¥18o of so4 2 compared to meteoric precipitation and glacial meltwater figs 5 6 table 1 comparison of so4 2 isotope composition with Œ¥18o of water fig 5 shows that so4 2 contributions from seawater in southern spitsbergen are mainly from sea spray aerosols this is supported by negative trends between Œ¥34s and Œ¥18o of so4 2 versus Œ¥18o of mineral thermal springs and proglacial waters fig 5 in case of direct mixing with seawater the increases of Œ¥34s and Œ¥18o of so4 2 and Œ¥18o of water would be expected which does not appear in the studied samples lack of direct mixing with seawater is also supported by lowest so4 2 concentrations and negative Œ¥18o measured in the groundwater of the rasstupet karst spring with largest contributions of sea spray so4 2 as inferred from highest Œ¥34s and Œ¥18o values figs 5a and 6 4 3 mixing processes in glacier system because of distinctive isotopic compositions of sulfide and seawater derived so4 2 fig 4 they appear to be a useful tracer for understanding mixing of groundwater with different chemical composition within the glacier catchment for example the proglacial zone of the werenskioldbreen showed clear mixing relationships between sulfide derived so4 2 from two main bedrock lithologies e g paleozoic carbonates precambrian crystalline rocks and sea spray fig 4 noteworthy the Œ¥34s and Œ¥18o values of so4 2 in several subglacial outflows at the werenskiodbreen terminus no 1 14 28 were closely related to the paleozoic carbonates which are not present in the proglacial zone but are known to underlie the glacier in upstream locations therefore the strong isotope signature of carbonate sulfide derived so4 2 in these subglacial outflows fig 4 must reflect longer probably deeper groundwater flows in the werenskioldbreen catchment conversely other outflows no 10 showed isotopic composition similar to so4 2 from

significantly higher cl so4 2 ratios of 55 compared to the orvin and bj√∏rnbein springs with lower ratios of 1 2 and lower temperatures fig 6b the observed higher cl so4 2 ratios might be related to longer residence time higher temperatures and deeper flow paths in the carbonate formations these are known to change water chemistry toward a na cl type in non glaciated catchment lauritzen and

5939,to date many laboratory based core scale i e flooding studies have focused on relatively homogeneous rock samples e g berea sandstone to study the migration characteristics of supercritical carbon dioxide sc co2 and evaluate these rocks for their potential geological co2 storage clay interlayers with low porosity and permeability developed in sandstones are often encountered in target reservoirs and can have an obvious influence on the distribution of injected sc co2 and the overall storage capacity of the reservoir to understand the impact of clay interlayers which act as thin layers of low porosity permeability rock with the surrounding rock being relatively homogeneous with much higher porosity permeability samples containing these interlayers were cored in two different orientations and both samples were subjected to core flooding experiments a high resolution x ray computed tomography x ct scanner was used to monitor the behavior of the fluid inside the samples during the experiment using x ct iamges and differential pressure data the migration and distribution characteristics of sc co2 inside the samples during the drainage process i e the process where sc co2 displaces brine are analyzed the results show that the drainage process for both samples occurs in three steps channel creation channel extension and channel stabilization however we find that the orientation of the clay interlayer has a significant effect on the sc co2 migration characteristics and storage capacity and that the sc co2 generally avoids the clay interlayer during drainage when the injection direction is parallel to the clay interlayer it acts like a shunt to separate the sc co2 flow and any fingering phenomenon is separated on either side of the clay interlayer with little crossflow when the injection direction is nearly perpendicular to the clay interlayer it acts as a barrier which prevents sc co2 moving ahead and affects the pressure propagation the final distribution of sc co2 resembles sweep behavior before the clay interlayer however fingering phenomenon occurs after the clay interlayer the displacement efficiency and storage capacity decreased by 43 14 and 40 74 by changing the orientation of a less than one millimeter thick clay interlayer vertical to the flooding direction keywords geologic co2 storage anisotropic sandstone clay interlayer x ct core flooding experiment 1 introduction geological carbon dioxide co2 capture utilization and storage ccus is a maturing technology which can help to mitigate global warming and solve the associated energy crisis kelektsoglou 2018 sun et al 2016 co2 can be captured at large point sources transported to suitable storage sites and then injected into the target reservoir l orange seigo et al 2014 li et al 2016 suitable target reservoirs contains depleted gas reservoirs coal seams and deep saline aquifers xu et al 2019 among these storage sites saline aquifers are particularly attractive for ccus due to their large potential storage capacity and high storage security derived from dissolution of co2 into the brine within the aquifer blackford et al 2015 ringrose 2018 within the context of large scale ccus projects in the world aside from storage for enhanced oil recovery deep saline aquifers are viewed as the most promising storage sites in order to research the migration characteristics of co2 and evaluate storage capacity many researchers have conducted core flooding studies using either isotropic rock samples or artificial porous materials shi et al 2011 conducted supercritical co2 sc co2 core flooding and imbibition experiment on a berea sandstone with x ray computed tomography x ct as well as numerical simulations ott et al 2012 researched displacement and mass transfer of sc co2 and brine in homogeneous sandstones during drainage and imbibition wang et al 2013 examined the change in permeability of a tight sandstone after immiscible co2 flooding using x ct yu et al 2014 utilized magnetic resonance imaging mri to understand the distribution of brine and sc co2 in packed glass bead cores and investigated the effects of capillary pressure this provided a convenient means of conducting experiments and demonstrated the basic migration characteristics of co2 in isotropic rocks however most target sandstone reservoirs currently being considered for larger scale ccus projects are heterogeneous and anisotropic pini et al 2013 have researched the capillary effects caused by heterogeneity in sandstone rocks during core flooding experiments by using ct scanning to calculate the sc co2 saturation inside the core wei et al 2014 have researched the effects of sub core scale structure heterogeneity on the distribution of sc co2 in liujiagou sandstone using medical industrial and micro x ct scanners these results were incorporated into a pore fluid simulation with comsol to evaluate the storage efficiency of the liujiagou formation in the ordos basin china zhang et al 2014 injected sc co2 into an anisotropic berea sandstone saturated with brine and monitored this process by medical x ct they demonstrated that the pore size porosity distribution and capillary pressure are the main factors influencing the migration characteristics of sc co2 in inhomogeneous samples miao et al 2019 provided an improved vinegar wellington calibration to calculate sc co2 saturation from ct images for a relatively anisotropic berea sandstone the analytical methods for researching the migration characteristics of sc co2 in relatively simple anisotropic rocks were provided and the fingering phenomenon was explained at a sub core scale however geological sedimentation and movements over a long period of time lead to discontinuous deposition often causing very thin and low porosity clay interlayers to form in sandstones de silva et al 2016 suitable deep saline aquifers for ccus in china are mainly distributed in the sichuan basin ordos basin and su xi chang region li et al 2013 xie et al 2014 with the history of sedimentation in these areas and presence of channel deposition environments many clay interlayers are formed in these areas hu et al 2018 zhaoguo 2007 these clay interlayers with a low porosity can have a significant influence on the permeability and gas flow characteristics of rock samples liu et al 2015 to the best of our knowledge the effects of clay interlayers on sc co2 migration and storage have not been investigated extensively some researchers have conducted experiments studying the chemical reactions of sc co2 with clay minerals to assess the integrity of clay containing caprocks over extended periods of time khather et al 2018 koukouzas et al 2018 pudlo et al 2015 szabo et al 2016 however there are some sedimentation conditions where clay minerals form distinct thin interlayers which have distinctly different properties compared to circumstances where clay minerals are uniformly distributed except for x ct and mri distributed fiber optic strain sensing was also used to understand the movement of a sc co2 plume as it entered a clay rich region of a core sample zhang et al 2019 samples with two distinct regions coarse grained high porosity and fine grained low porosity were used for that study artificially consolidated sandstones of varying heterogeneity were used to mimic thick caprock layers in a reservoir and to understand immiscible multiphase flow behavior in a water oil co2 ternary system wang et al 2018 these models contain two parts with different physical properties and the significant difference is that the thin clay interlayer is the only source of heterogeneity in an otherwise relatively homogeneous rock as the thin clay interlayer has a significant influence on the distribution of injected sc co2 it is necessary to investigate further the distribution and storage capacity of sc co2 in anisotropic samples with these types of clay interlayers the main aim of this study is to conduct a fundamental core flooding experiment to understand the migration characteristics of sc co2 in a sandstone core sample with a thin clay interlayer a high resolution x ct scanner was used to monitor the whole experiment and using ct images the sc co2 saturation and storage capacity are calculated the results from two samples with obviously different clay interlayer orientations parallel and perpendicular to the flow direction are compared this work will help in providing a reliable basis for evaluating storage safety and storage capacity of target reservoirs 2 materials and methods 2 1 samples reservoir sandstone samples from sichuan basin southwestern china fig 1 a and b were used to conduct the experiments for study the samples were collected from a large outcrop in the penglaizhen formation which belongs to the upper jurassic age according to previous research the samples were developed in a delta front sub facies sedimentary mode guo et al 2018 for comparison two samples containing thin clay interlayers were cored from two adjacent positions of a large outcrop fig 1c in different orientation angles of 3 and 85 between the rock axial direction and the clay interlayer bedding fig 1d and e for convenience in the remainder of this paper the 3 sample with the clay layer nearly parallel to the flow direction is referred to as sample h and the 85 sample with the clay layer nearly perpendicular to the flow direction is referred to as sample v some basic information about both samples is listed in table 1 despite having different bedding angles x ray diffraction xrd results show that sample h and sample v have similar mineral compositions as shown in fig 2 the main minerals are quartz albite muscovite and microcline with a small amount of calcite dolomite chlorite and rutile the estimated mineral composition in the samples are listed in table 2 in addition the pore size distribution measured by nuclear magnetic resonance nmr are similar fig 3 the mercury intrusion porosimetry mip method was not used as it is destructive and influenced by moisture wang and yu 2016 the permeability tested by an ap 608 automated permeameter porosimeter of these two samples using n2 are 307 3 md sample h and 123 3 md sample v respectively the ionic composition of the brine used in this experiment is shown in table 3 iodide is added to the brine to enhance the contrast in the x ct imaging and aid in distinguishing the aqueous phase and the sc co2 phase 2 2 experimental setup fig 4 a is a schematic diagram of the experimental system that consists of three modules a 38 mm x ct transparent core holder fig 4b a fluid injection and production system fig 4c and a heating module fig 4e the core sample is placed in the core holder and the desired confining pressures is applied to the sample with hydraulic oil using an isco syringe pump pressurized brine and sc co2 are delivered to the sample loaded in the core holder at the desired flow rate using two separate isco pumps back pressure is applied on the effluent of the core holder using an isco pump in pressure control mode in reverse to accommodate fluid gas production the core holder is constructed from an x ray transparent composite material of aluminum and carbon fiber with maximum pressure temperature working conditions of 5000 psi and 80 c as shown in fig 4b a medical x ct scanner siemens german located at csiro s facilities in perth western australia with a high speed helical scan system was used to image the interior of the sandstone samples and visualize the behavior of brine and sc co2 inside the sample in real time during core flooding experiments in each scan images were reconstructed at 512 512 pixels and with a 0 4 mm interval between slices the voxel size was 0 125 mm width 0 125 mm height 0 4 mm depth the java based imagej software package was used to process the images generated by the ct scanner for temperature control we used a temperature controller shown in fig 4e to heat the core holder and kept the temperature at 40 c as the flow rate used in the experiments was very slow at 0 5 ml min the gaseous co2 undergoes a phase change to supercritical upon entering the heated core holder 2 3 core flooding experimental procedure 1 for calibrating the saturation values to the ct number a thin walled glass bottle containing air and brine was placed into the core holder in a horizontal configuration the x ct scanner was then used to get the ct numbers of pure air and brine 2 a clean core sample was placed in the core holder in a horizontal configuration and confining pressure was maintained at 580 psi while the core holder was heated to 40 c the ct scanner was used to scan the sample saturated with air and then a vacuum pump was used to vacuum the sample for more than 2 h 3 the confining pressure and back pressure were then set at 1305 psi and 725 psi respectively brine was injected into the sample at a flow rate of 0 5 ml min for 14 h and the x ct scanner was used to scan the sample when it was fully saturated with brine at the end of this injection period 4 the confining pressure and back pressure were then set at 1740 psi and 1160 psi respectively and sc co2 was injected into the sample through an in line water bubbler to prevent the sc co2 from drying out the sample during the flooding at a flow rate of 0 5 ml min the x ct scanner was used to scan the sample when the volumes of injected sc co2 were 0 2 pore volumes pv 0 4 pv 0 6 pv 0 8 pv 1 0 pv 2 0 pv 3 0 pv and so on at 1 0 pv intervals this drainage process lasted for nearly 4 h and was continued until the average ct numbers of each slice were stable 5 pressure from the core holder was decreased to ambient and the sample was removed sample was then put into a soxhlet extractor and methanol was used to clean it for two days afterwards the sample was placed in a drying oven and dried it was then placed into the core holder again and the temperature of the core holder was heated to 40 c and the confining pressure and back pressure were set at 1740 psi and 1160 psi respectively the x ct scanner was used to image the sample saturated with air then the vacuum pump was used on the flooding system and then sc co2 was injected into the sample for half a day the x ct scanner was used to scan the sample saturated with sc co2 6 pressure from the core holder was decreased to ambient and the samples were removed these steps above were repeated for the other sample 2 4 measurement porosity and co2 saturation x rays decay differently as they pass through material with different densities this phenomenon is reflected in differences in ct numbers which can be used to calculate the porosity and co2 saturation of the sample based on ct images a method based on beer s law can be used to measure the porosity saturation from ct numbers of two slice images at the same position obtained with different fluids saturating the porous medium withjack and akervoll 1988 this x ct method is a fast and convenient methodology to map the fluid saturations assuming sufficient contrast in the core samples honarpour 1986 to determine the fluid saturations the following equations are widely used in this area of research and are listed as follows akin and kovscek 2003 krishnamurthy et al 2017 oh et al 2019 1 œï ct bri sat ct dry ct bri ct ari 2 s c o 2 ct exp ct bri sat ct c o 2 sat ct bri sat where œï is the voxel porosity s c o 2 is the degree of co2 saturation ct bri and ct air are the ct numbers for pure brine and air ct bri sat ct dry ct c o 2 sat ct exp are the ct number for brine saturated dry co2 saturated and experimental conditions during the drainage progress respectively 2 5 image post processing imagej software was chosen for post processing the ct images and two main implementations of this software were utilized in this study the first implementation is to obtain an accurate mean ct number for each slice which is then used to calculate porosity and co2 saturation in order to exclude the effect of the sample ct numbers caused by the core sleeve shrink wrap and confining fluid fig 4b calculations were limited to the interior of a concentric circle with a diameter of 36 mm with the core samples being 38 mm in diameter in other words the outer part of the concentric circle was removed from consideration and the average ct numbers were calculated inside the concentric circle the ct numbers are converted to porosity and saturation values based on equations 1 and 2 above this second implementation of the software is to implement the image calculator function in the software with this calculator the ct values from two different images can be subtracted and the change in the ct numbers from one image to another as more pore volumes of sc co2 are injected can be assessed these subtracted images can be used to visualize the migration characteristics of fluid along the direction of the fluid false color imaging was used to enhance contrast and make experimental result more evident 3 results 3 1 porosity calculated based on x ct images the porosity of each slice of two samples is determined with brine and calculated using the above equation 1 as shown in fig 5 the average porosity values for each image from sample h are fairly constant aside from imaging artifacts and capillary effects at the ends of the samples at approximately 16 9 in contrast the average porosity for each slice over the length of sample v is considerably less uniform due to the bedding direction of sample v s clay interlayer being almost perpendicular to the length of the rock there is an obvious drop of porosity at the position of the clay interlayer the calculated average porosity of each image slice for sample v is somewhat lower at approximately 16 0 the differences in the porosity caused by the clay interlayer in sample h is averaged out in each slice and is relatively uniform due to its orientation and this is the main reason why little variation in the porosity is observed for sample h in sample v however the average porosity decreases over a distance of 20 to 30 mm from core inlet the reason for this dispersion is that the actual geological deposition processes that formed this core sample are very complicated and slow resulting in the volume near the thin clay interlayer likely also containing some clay furthermore the clay interlayer is not actually exactly vertical to the axial direction and this will cause the decrease is porosity due to the thin clay interlayer to be smeared over multiple slices this will be discussed in more detail later in the discussion section of this paper 3 2 differential pressure response in the context of core flooding differential pressure is the difference in the pressure values between the inlet and outlet of the core sample and can be measured by a single specialized differential pressure gauge see fig 4a a build up in the differential pressure can be used to estimate when the sc co2 reaches the clay interlayer furthermore pressure measurements can be used to assess the any leakage during the core flooding operations based on previous experiments by other researchers comparing the physical parameters of the samples and experimental conditions khather et al 2018 khather et al 2017 kim et al 2018 oh et al 2017 shojaei et al 2015 with the sample used in this paper the differential pressure curves measured in our experiments are consistent with expectations and we can confidently say that leakage was not evident in these experiments as shown in fig 6 the differential pressure response curve for sample h can be divided into three sections sh s1 sh s2 and sh s3 during section sh s1 the differential pressure increases from 0 6 psi to 1 63 psi rapidly suggesting that the sc co2 has reached the inlet of sample h at a flow rate of 0 5 ml min for sc co2 the gas accumulates at the inlet of sample h until the differential pressure exceeds the capillary entry pressure preventing the migration of sc co2 into the sample at lower pressures section sh s2 shows the sc co2 entering the sample with the differential pressure initially decreases rapidly and then slowly until stabilizing at approximately 1 05 psi this suggests that the sc co2 displaces the brine in relatively large pores with a small capillary entry pressure at first and then displaces the brine next in relatively small pores hosseinzadeh hejazi et al 2019 qian et al 2019 wei et al 2019 section sh s2 begins with an sc co2 injection volume approximately 0 1 pv and ends at approximately 3 0 pv in section sh s3 the final section the differential pressure is fairly constant and the flow is continued to ensure that the saturation distribution has reached equilibrium the differential pressure response curve for sample v is noticeably different than the response curve for samples in several ways the first is that the differential pressure response curve for sample v is divided into four sections sv s1 sv s2 sv s3 and sv s4 the second one is that the differential pressure increases to a higher value of 2 21 psi rapidly in section sv s1 relative to section sh s1 the reason for this difference is that sample v has a higher capillary entry pressure due to the bedding direction being nearly perpendicular to the flooding direction the third and most important difference is that the differential pressure increases initially to a higher value of 2 83 psi in section sv s2 this phenomenon suggests that sc co2 reaches the clay interlayer which is perpendicular to the flooding direction and accumulates before the differential pressure surpasses the capillary entry pressure near the clay interlayer sections sv s3 and sv s4 are similar to sections sh s2 and sh s3 respectively the differential pressure decreases rapidly and then slowly until stabilizing at approximately 1 3 psi when sc co2 displaces the brine the fourth difference is that section sv s3 needs more time to complete starting at 0 36 pv of sc co2 and ending at approximately 5 0 pv in section sv s4 the final section the stabilized differential pressure is slightly higher at 1 44 psi compared to section sh s3 at 1 05 psi which is consistent with sample v having a lower overall permeability relative to sample h 3 3 migration characteristics of sc co2 previous research on sc co2 brine core flooding has shown that in isotropic and homogeneous rock samples a sweep phenomenon tends to dominate alemu et al 2011 while fingering behavior becomes more pronounced in more anisotropic samples ni et al 2019 as the rock core itself exhibits a significant variation in ct number it can be difficult to distinguish between sc co2 and brine with imaging so a contrast agent e g iodide see table 1 is added to the brine solution to allow these phases to be easily differentiated figs 7 and 10 show the ct number distribution during the drainage process inside sample h and sample v respectively in these images based on the principle of ct number the thin clay interlayers being a denser material than the surrounding sandstone are quite evident with a substantially higher ct number fig 7b and 10b show the ct number distribution when the sample is brine saturated the density of brine is higher than sc co2 so samples saturated with brine fig 7b and 10b have larger ct numbers relative to those saturated with sc co2 fig 7j and 10j figs 8 and 11 show the distribution of sc co2 obtained using image subtraction using equation 2 during the drainage process in sample h and v respectively for both figs 8 and 11 the clay interlayer is no longer visible suggesting that the composition of the clay interlayer does not change during the flooding process for sample h fig 8c shows that sc co2 has not reached the outlet when 0 2 pv of sc co2 is injected at 0 4 pv sc co2 begins to appear at the outlet suggesting some degree of finger is occurring fig 8d from the onset as shown in fig 8e to 8j the clay interlayer divides the sc co2 flow into two parts and it is evident that the lower portion is slightly more permeable as the sc co2 channeling is more pronounced in that section as fig 8e to 8j look very similar it is difficult to identify the migration of sc co2 subtraction of sequential images e g subtracting the 3rd image from the 4th image can elucidate the migration characteristics of sc co2 fig 9 as shown in fig 9b to 9d most of the change in ct images occurs before 0 6 pv and after that there is only a slight change after 3 0 pv of sc co2 was injected into sample h fig 9i shows no significant change in sc co2 saturation channel suggesting that the channel formed was sufficient for sc co2 to pass through unimpeded at 0 5 ml min the situation is quite different for sample v as shown in fig 11 corresponding to co2 saturation similar to fig 8 for sample h and 12 corresponding to changes in the co2 saturation during injection intervals the clay interlayer perpendicular to the flow direction acts as a natural barrier preventing the migration of sc co2 sc co2 was almost entirely blocked by the clay interlayer when only 0 2 pv co2 was injected fig 11c breakthrough was evident at 0 4 pv which is consistent with differential pressure data shown in section sv s2 of fig 6 and sc co2 quickly arrived at the outlet fig 11d fig 12 c and 12d suggest that a channel is forming and that the injected sc co2 is not only passing through the sample but is displacing the brine near the channel fig 12e however fig 12g suggests that even after 1 0 pv of sc co2 has passed through the core there is still some further accumulation of sc co2 before the clay interlayer finally in the final images i e fig 11j there is an obvious difference in the distribution of sc co2 before and after the clay interlayer before the clay interlayer the final distribution of sc co2 resembles sweep behavior however after the clay interlayer it appears that fingering is significant the sc co2 passes through the sample along the margin after the clay interlayer suggesting that there is channeling occurring at the surface possible reasons for this will be examined in the discussion section in any case sample v shows a significant buildup of more sc co2 prior to the clay interlayer compared to after the interlayer fig 11j 3 4 sc co2 saturation during displacement of brine the sc co2 saturation of two samples are calculated using the above equation 2 figs 13 and 14 show the change of average sc co2 saturation for each slice over the drainage process of samples h and v respectively for sample h the sc co2 saturation from 45 mm into the sample to the outlet is zero after injection of 0 2 pv sc co2 suggesting that the sc co2 had not channeled sufficiently through the core sample at that stage at 0 4 pv injection of sc co2 the sc co2 saturation increases from 0 04 to 0 17 at 30 mm and increases from zero to 0 02 at the outlet between 0 2 and 0 4 pv the most dramatic increase in the saturation an increase of nearly 162 averaged over the whole sample occurs suggesting that a sc co2 channel is created following this the sc co2 saturation curve moves up gradually across the whole length of the core suggesting the channel that was formed initially is extending during this step from 1 0 to 3 0 pv of injection the sc co2 saturation only increases by a further 28 after the initial channel was created finally the co2 saturation stabilizes gradually after 3 0 pv of sc co2 injected and this step is called channel stabilization and the sc co2 saturation curve does not change appreciably after more sc co2 is injected into the samples at the same flow rate moreover the sc co2 saturation shows a decreasing trend along the length of the core with a saturation of 0 31 at the inlet and 0 05 at the outlet after the drainage has finished this varying co2 saturation curve reflects the fingering phenomenon to some extent the drainage processes in sample h and sample v follow similar steps in terms of channel formation extension and stabilization however the co2 saturation curve of sample v is quite different from that of sample h as shown in fig 14 the co2 saturation curve is divided into two parts after injecting 0 2 pv sc co2 at first the dividing line at approximately 23 mm into sample v is the location of the clay interlayer as discussed earlier the sc co2 breaks through the clay interlayer during 0 2 to 0 4 pv portion of the sc co2 injection process with an increase in the co2 saturation value occurring as with the breakthrough a larger differential pressure is required for this step as mentioned above after this initial channel creation the next two steps of sample v are similar to those of sample h however due to the clay interlayer the curve is divided into two distinct parts throughout the whole drainage process there is a rapid decrease near 23 mm from the inlet and the final average co2 saturation is approximately 0 36 before the clay interlayer while it is 0 21 after the interlayer overall after the drainage process is completed the clay interlayer with less than 1 mm thickness has a dramatic impact on the sc co2 saturation distribution 4 discussion zhu et al 2013 pointed out that there is very little reaction between co2 brine mixtures and minerals in sandstone during the very short timeframe of a typical core flooding experiment furthermore the clay interlayer is no longer visible in the co2 saturation images figs 8 and 11 suggesting that the clay interlayer does not change in co2 composition during the flooding process for these two reasons this paper does not consider chemical reactions of co2 brine with either the sandstone or clay interlayer the low porosity permeability characteristics of the thin clay interlayers dominate the effects of co2 distribution and flow in the two core samples for both samples the channel formation for flow of co2 seems to follow the same three steps channel creation channel extension and channel stabilization channel creation occurs when the injected sc co2 reaches the outlet and builds an initial channel channel extension occurs when the sc co2 injection continues enlarging the initial channel by dissolving and displacing the brine near the initial channel during the creation and extension processes the flow rate of sc co2 from the outlet is different than the flow rate of sc co2 into the inlet during the channel creation the differential pressure between the inlet and outlet slowly decreases and stabilizes as the total capillary pressure that needs to be surpassed decreases during the channel stabilization phase the flow rates at the inlet and outlet are the same and the sc co2 saturation distribution does not change the sc co2 displaces the brine however this effect is uneven due to the existence of the clay interlayer miao et al 2019 despite the similarities in the channel formation there are several differences in the drainage processes for both samples and the evolution of the sc co2 saturation changes are quite different between sample h and sample v simply due to the orientation of the clay interlayer the saturation distribution curves as a function of length along the core sample i e figs 13 and 14 for both samples are very different for sample h it is almost a line with a negative slope while sample v is nearly a line whose slope is almost zero before and after the clay interlayer with an abrupt change between these two lines representing the clay interlayer initially as sc co2 is injected into the sample v from the inlet the sandstone part before the clay interlayer contains substantially more sc co2 than after the clay interlayer fingering behavior is observed very quickly following co2 injection in the sample whose bedding is parallel to the flooding direction i e sample h the second difference is that the values of terminal average saturation for sample h and sample v are 0 210 and 0 272 respectively the average saturation of sample h is 29 5 lower than that of sample v by comparing the progression in figs 13 and 14 the third difference is that for a 0 5 ml min flow rate of sc co2 sample v takes almost twice as long to form a stable channel the experimental results confirm that the clay interlayer has a nonnegligible influence on the behavior of fluid inside the sample the influence of surface flow i e leaking fluid between the surface of the core and the core sleeve can be excluded after considering differential pressure responses during the sc co2 injection 4 1 effects of clay interlayer on the migration characteristics of sc co2 previous studies indicated that the distribution of sc co2 in the sample depends on sub core scale porosity permeability and capillary pressure zhang et al 2014 the porosity and permeability of both samples were tested by an ap 608 automated permeameter porosimeter the pore size distribution of two samples were measured by nmr and the porosity of each slice were calculated based on x ct images the results show that the average porosity table 1 and pore size distribution fig 3 of the two samples are almost the same however the orientation of the bedding layer causes a significant difference in n2 permeability between the two samples with sample v having significantly less permeability relative to sample h see table 1 this difference is attributed to the orientation of the clay layer and is not a result of differences in the porosity or permeability of the homogeneous portions of either sample in otherwise similar rock samples porosity typically has a strong correlation with the permeability and capillary pressure a lower porosity tends to result in a lower permeability and higher capillary force an absolute permeability model that relates porosity and permeability without considering chemical reactions is given by the kozeny carman equation krause et al 2011a krause et al 2011b peng et al 2014 3 k œÜ 3 s 1 œÜ 2 where k and œÜ are the permeability and the porosity of each voxel and s is a scaling factor used to ensure the average permeability of each voxel is equal to the sample permeability when co2 undergoes piston displacement of brine a crescent shaped boundary between the phases form in the two phase flow area the pressure on both sides of the boundary is discontinuous and this pressure difference is attributed to capillary forces the equations for the capillary pressure p c and the entry pressure p entry are bachu and bennion 2009 zhang and yu 2016 4 p c œÉ c o s Œ∏ œÜ k j s w 5 p entry 2 œÉ c o s Œ∏ r where œÉ is the interfacial tension between brine and co2 Œ∏ is the contact angle between brine and co2 r is the maximum radius of the interconnected pore throat within the sample a higher porosity generally correlated with a larger r and j s w is a correlation used to describe the fluid saturation and capillary pressure a 3d model of sample h has been reconstructed from the ct scanner images and six slices were chosen to show the porosity along sample h fig 15 the bottom of each slice has a higher porosity and hence it is more permeable relative to the other parts since the extension direction of clay interlayer development in sample h is nearly parallel to the flooding direction the clay interlayer in sample h plays the role of guiding fluid flow when sc co2 reaches the inlet of the sample the almost impermeable clay interlayer divides the sc co2 into two parts i e an upper part and a lower part the sandstone part below the clay interlayer is slightly more permeable than that above the clay interlayer giving rise to more prevalent fingering in the lower zone relative to the upper zone see fig 9b and c the fingering phenomenon occurring on either side of the clay interlayer in many ways mimics the drainage in core samples with bedding layers zhang et al 2013 a 3d model of sample v has also similarly been constructed by the ct images and six slices were cut to show the porosity along the sample v fig 16 the sample was divided into two parts the interior of the sample and near the sample surface as shown in each slice of sample h the concentric circle representing the interior and the core boundary have diameters of 27 4 and 36 mm respectively among these slices two slices are before the interlayer slice one slice corresponds to the clay interlayer and three slices are after the clay interlayer each of these has a voxel porosity near the surface which is smaller than in the interior of the core this may be due to the large external disturbance of the rock sample during the drilling of sandstone resulting in greater porosity at the core sample inlet shown on the first slice of the sample the voxel porosity in the interior of sample v is 15 5 which is smaller than that near the surface 19 2 for the clay interlayer shown on the third slice of the sample the voxel porosity ranges from 7 3 to 11 7 with an average porosity of 9 2 based on the images these porosity values are indicative of a natural barrier for sc co2 migration in sample v assuming the same s factor the calculated permeability eq 3 gives a value for the inlet sandstone slice that is nearly eight times than that of the clay interlayer slice furthermore based on the porosity differences observed in the inlet sandstone slice the permeability near the sample surface is approximately twice that in interior of the sample capillary pressure effects are also a significant controlling factor in the volume prior to the clay interlayer because tabular or flaky minerals often form parallel to bedding in sedimentary rocks the effective r value eq 5 is smaller in sample v where the flooding direction is nearly perpendicular to the sedimentary bedding compared to sample h initially compared to sample h sample v requires a larger differential pressure due to a higher p entry needed when the sc co2 reaches the sample fig 6 with the area near the sample surface having a higher porosity and being more permeable than the area within the sample the r value is bigger in the high porosity area than in the low porosity area resulting in sc co2 preferentially flowing near the surface as it has a smaller p entry this is confirmed by fig 12c which shows a selective increase in the sc co2 saturation near the surface after breakthrough the differential pressure drops slightly until the sc co2 reaches some resistance associated with the clay interlayer and the differential pressure rises again at approximately 0 2 pv injection see section sv s2 in fig 6 at this point the sc co2 saturation nearly reaches equilibrium upstream of the clay interlayer after a further buildup in the differential pressure between 0 2 pv and 0 4 pv injected sc co2 the entry pressure associated with the clay interlayer is overcome as shown in fig 10b the thickness of the clay interlayer is not uniform and there are weak points developed on the clay interlayer indicated by the black circles the sc co2 could establish a channel is this volume where the entry pressure is smaller meanwhile due to the larger porosity near the surface of the sample v this could be the reason why the sc co2 preferentially flows near the surface after breaking through the interlayer after that the sc co2 displaces the brine near the previous channel and the sc co2 channel expands this channel extension continues with ongoing injection and the differential pressure and flow channel stabilizes since the orientation of the clay interlayer in sample v is perpendicular to the flooding direction the clay interlayer in sample v plays the role of a barrier when the sc co2 reaches the clay interlayer it is blocked initially and a larger differential pressure was needed to overcome the p entry for the clay interlayer or the region of the sample near it the clay interlayer divided sample v into two parts when sc co2 reaches the core surface it is injected fairly homogeneously over the cross section area however when sc co2 breaks through the clay interlayer for the sandstone part behind the clay interlayer sc co2 is injected into the parts through long narrow holes fig 17 the drainage process resembles sweep behavior before the clay interlayer however after the clay interlayer fingering behavior seems to dominate and after channel creation miscibility of sc co2 and brine is an important way of channel expansion the clay interlayer in sample v provided a relatively closed area for miscibility while it only happened near the initial channel in sample h 4 2 effects of clay interlayer on the sc co2 displacement efficiency and storage capacity the displacement efficiency and storage capacity are amongst the most important parameters for the practical implementation of geological co2 storage for the ccus industry aljamaan et al 2017 using the x ct images the storage capacity associated with each slice can be calculated by multiplying the average sc co2 saturation by the pore space volume for each slice i e the average porosity of the slice multiple by the total volume of the slice according to the equation 1 the storage efficiency is just the average sc co2 saturation the two primary factors influencing displacement efficiency and storage capacity are the presence of the clay interlayer and the relationship between the deposition direction and flooding direction the co2 displacement efficiency and storage capacity for both samples at 0 4 pv and drainage completion are given in figs 18 and 19 consistent with the discussion above the co2 saturation curve for sample v fig 14 has a distinct jump lower at a distance of 23 mm along the sample associated with the clay interlayer at 0 2 and 0 4 pv as the co2 mainly moves forward and expanded the flow channel after breaking through the clay interlayer this jump becomes less distinct after injection of more co2 sample h does not have this effect as the orientation of the clay interlayer is parallel to flow direction for this reason the effect of the relationship between the deposition direction and flooding direction on the storage efficiency can be ascertained by comparing the storage efficiencies and capacities at 0 4 pv when the front part of only 20 mm is selected for assessment fig 18 shows that the displacement efficiency and storage capacity are more uniform when the flooding direction is nearly perpendicular to these bedding direction i e sample v presumably due to sweep behavior in this volume of the core in contrast the displacement efficiency and storage capacity show a quick drop along the sample length when the injection direction is parallel to the bedding direction i e sample h due to fingering behavior dominating over the whole length near the inlet at a distance from 0 to 3 7 mm the displacement efficiency and storage capacity for sample v are higher than those for sample h the reason for this is ascertained by comparing fig 8d with fig 11d showing that the fingering phenomenon occurred earlier when the injection direction is parallel to the bedding direction the average displacement efficiency is 0 26 for sample v while it is only 0 20 for sample h the average displacement efficiency for sample v is 30 greater than sample h when only the first 20 mm section is considered and this effect could become more pronounced if different geometries are used e g a longer sample for the first 20 mm the average storage capacity of sample v in each slice is 0 0189 ml and that of sample h is only 0 0156 ml 21 greater as mentioned above the ap 608 automated permeameter porosimeter and nmr were used to obtain the porosity and pore size distribution for the two samples the results showed that sample v and sample h have a very similar porosity and pore size distribution table 1 and fig 3 in fact the porosity of sample v is a little smaller than that of sample h and because the t2 spectrum of the sample v is to the right the sample v has more smaller pores than sample h in addition the porosity distributions of two samples measured by ct images also showed that the sample v has few pores than sample h see fig 5 but the result was that sample v stored more sc co2 than sample h highlighting the impact of the clay interlayer for sample h the function of the clay interlayer is more like a shunt and the clay interlayer divides the injected sc co2 into two parts and no sc co2 appears near the clay interlayer as a result in many ways the displacement efficiency and storage capacity are quite similar to a sandstone sample without a clay interlayer berg et al 2013 as shown in fig 19 for sample h the displacement efficiency and storage capacity of each slice near the inlet are 0 286 and 0 017 ml respectively while these two values are 0 056 and 0 004 ml near the outlet for sample v the clay interlayer acted as a barrier impeding the migration of sc co2 and propagation of pressure sc co2 accumulated when it migrated close to the surface of this barrier as such the displacement efficiency and storage capacity along sample v before and after the clay interlayer are not the same before the clay interlayer the average displacement efficiency and capacity of each slice are 0 364 and 0 027 ml respectively after the clay interlayer the average displacement efficiency and capacity of each slice are 0 207 and 0 016 ml respectively due to the presence of a clay interlayer of less than one millimeter the displacement efficiency and storage capacity decreased by 43 14 and 40 74 respectively considering the effects of the clay interlayer and the relationship between the deposition direction and flooding direction the core of the anticline is a favorable site for co2 storage when sc co2 is injected from the core of the anticline the direction of flooding is parallel to the direction of bedding expansion and sc co2 will first move in the direction of bedding similar to the behavior in sample h when sc co2 reaches the flanks of the anticline the direction of flooding is nearly perpendicular to the direction of bedding like that in sample v due to the existence of multiple clay interlayers fig 1c the sc co2 will be blocked by the flanks which will increase the storage capacity and integrity 5 conclusions in this paper core flooding experiments are conducted to investigate the migration of sc co2 in the anisotropic sandstone with a thin clay interlayer by x ct monitoring two samples cored in different directions are saturated with iodide containing brine for contrast purposes and then sc co2 is injected at a flow rate of 0 5 ml min these drainage processes are all imaged using x ct and the sc co2 saturation values of each image slice are calculated the following main conclusions can be summarized from the experiment the clay interlayer has a low porosity low permeability and high capillary pressure characteristics compared to the nearby sandstone part the sandstone part near the clay interlayer has more clay content than that farther from the clay interlayer sc co2 avoids the clay interlayer during the drainage and the clay interlayer does not change in composition during the flooding process after drainage for a short time the effects of clay interlayer on the migration characteristics of sc co2 depend on the different bedding angles of the clay interlayer the clay interlayer is like a shunt to separate the sc co2 flow into different parts without joints when the injection direction is parallel to the clay interlayer and the fingering phenomenon happens in different parts while the clay interlayer is a barrier which prevents sc co2 moving ahead and affects the pressure propagation when the injection direction is nearly perpendicular to the clay interlayer before the clay interlayer the final distribution of sc co2 resembles sweep behavior however after the clay interlayer it appears that fingering is significant the co2 saturation curves of two samples are quite different due to the different bedding angles of the clay interlayer with the corresponding effects of clay interlayer on migration characteristics of sc co2 the sc co2 saturation curves show a quick drop along the sample length when the injection direction is parallel to the bedding direction however when the injection direction is vertical to the bedding direction the sc co2 saturation curve is a different value before and after the clay interlayer but is actually quite uniform in each section the relationship between the deposition direction of the clay interlayer and the flooding direction strongly influences the displacement efficiency and storage capacity for the scenario investigated in this paper the average displacement efficiency is 30 greater when the deposition direction and flooding direction are perpendicular compared to the case when the deposition direction and flooding direction are parallel when a clay interlayer less than one millimeter thick is perpendicular to the flooding direction a noticeable decrease in the displacement efficiency and storage capacity are observed downstream of the clay interlayer declaration of

5939,to date many laboratory based core scale i e flooding studies have focused on relatively homogeneous rock samples e g berea sandstone to study the migration characteristics of supercritical carbon dioxide sc co2 and evaluate these rocks for their potential geological co2 storage clay interlayers with low porosity and permeability developed in sandstones are often encountered in target reservoirs and can have an obvious influence on the distribution of injected sc co2 and the overall storage capacity of the reservoir to understand the impact of clay interlayers which act as thin layers of low porosity permeability rock with the surrounding rock being relatively homogeneous with much higher porosity permeability samples containing these interlayers were cored in two different orientations and both samples were subjected to core flooding experiments a high resolution x ray computed tomography x ct scanner was used to monitor the behavior of the fluid inside the samples during the experiment using x ct iamges and differential pressure data the migration and distribution characteristics of sc co2 inside the samples during the drainage process i e the process where sc co2 displaces brine are analyzed the results show that the drainage process for both samples occurs in three steps channel creation channel extension and channel stabilization however we find that the orientation of the clay interlayer has a significant effect on the sc co2 migration characteristics and storage capacity and that the sc co2 generally avoids the clay interlayer during drainage when the injection direction is parallel to the clay interlayer it acts like a shunt to separate the sc co2 flow and any fingering phenomenon is separated on either side of the clay interlayer with little crossflow when the injection direction is nearly perpendicular to the clay interlayer it acts as a barrier which prevents sc co2 moving ahead and affects the pressure propagation the final distribution of sc co2 resembles sweep behavior before the clay interlayer however fingering phenomenon occurs after the clay interlayer the displacement efficiency and storage capacity decreased by 43 14 and 40 74 by changing the orientation of a less than one millimeter thick clay interlayer vertical to the flooding direction keywords geologic co2 storage anisotropic sandstone clay interlayer x ct core flooding experiment 1 introduction geological carbon dioxide co2 capture utilization and storage ccus is a maturing technology which can help to mitigate global warming and solve the associated energy crisis kelektsoglou 2018 sun et al 2016 co2 can be captured at large point sources transported to suitable storage sites and then injected into the target reservoir l orange seigo et al 2014 li et al 2016 suitable target reservoirs contains depleted gas reservoirs coal seams and deep saline aquifers xu et al 2019 among these storage sites saline aquifers are particularly attractive for ccus due to their large potential storage capacity and high storage security derived from dissolution of co2 into the brine within the aquifer blackford et al 2015 ringrose 2018 within the context of large scale ccus projects in the world aside from storage for enhanced oil recovery deep saline aquifers are viewed as the most promising storage sites in order to research the migration characteristics of co2 and evaluate storage capacity many researchers have conducted core flooding studies using either isotropic rock samples or artificial porous materials shi et al 2011 conducted supercritical co2 sc co2 core flooding and imbibition experiment on a berea sandstone with x ray computed tomography x ct as well as numerical simulations ott et al 2012 researched displacement and mass transfer of sc co2 and brine in homogeneous sandstones during drainage and imbibition wang et al 2013 examined the change in permeability of a tight sandstone after immiscible co2 flooding using x ct yu et al 2014 utilized magnetic resonance imaging mri to understand the distribution of brine and sc co2 in packed glass bead cores and investigated the effects of capillary pressure this provided a convenient means of conducting experiments and demonstrated the basic migration characteristics of co2 in isotropic rocks however most target sandstone reservoirs currently being considered for larger scale ccus projects are heterogeneous and anisotropic pini et al 2013 have researched the capillary effects caused by heterogeneity in sandstone rocks during core flooding experiments by using ct scanning to calculate the sc co2 saturation inside the core wei et al 2014 have researched the effects of sub core scale structure heterogeneity on the distribution of sc co2 in liujiagou sandstone using medical industrial and micro x ct scanners these results were incorporated into a pore fluid simulation with comsol to evaluate the storage efficiency of the liujiagou formation in the ordos basin china zhang et al 2014 injected sc co2 into an anisotropic berea sandstone saturated with brine and monitored this process by medical x ct they demonstrated that the pore size porosity distribution and capillary pressure are the main factors influencing the migration characteristics of sc co2 in inhomogeneous samples miao et al 2019 provided an improved vinegar wellington calibration to calculate sc co2 saturation from ct images for a relatively anisotropic berea sandstone the analytical methods for researching the migration characteristics of sc co2 in relatively simple anisotropic rocks were provided and the fingering phenomenon was explained at a sub core scale however geological sedimentation and movements over a long period of time lead to discontinuous deposition often causing very thin and low porosity clay interlayers to form in sandstones de silva et al 2016 suitable deep saline aquifers for ccus in china are mainly distributed in the sichuan basin ordos basin and su xi chang region li et al 2013 xie et al 2014 with the history of sedimentation in these areas and presence of channel deposition environments many clay interlayers are formed in these areas hu et al 2018 zhaoguo 2007 these clay interlayers with a low porosity can have a significant influence on the permeability and gas flow characteristics of rock samples liu et al 2015 to the best of our knowledge the effects of clay interlayers on sc co2 migration and storage have not been investigated extensively some researchers have conducted experiments studying the chemical reactions of sc co2 with clay minerals to assess the integrity of clay containing caprocks over extended periods of time khather et al 2018 koukouzas et al 2018 pudlo et al 2015 szabo et al 2016 however there are some sedimentation conditions where clay minerals form distinct thin interlayers which have distinctly different properties compared to circumstances where clay minerals are uniformly distributed except for x ct and mri distributed fiber optic strain sensing was also used to understand the movement of a sc co2 plume as it entered a clay rich region of a core sample zhang et al 2019 samples with two distinct regions coarse grained high porosity and fine grained low porosity were used for that study artificially consolidated sandstones of varying heterogeneity were used to mimic thick caprock layers in a reservoir and to understand immiscible multiphase flow behavior in a water oil co2 ternary system wang et al 2018 these models contain two parts with different physical properties and the significant difference is that the thin clay interlayer is the only source of heterogeneity in an otherwise relatively homogeneous rock as the thin clay interlayer has a significant influence on the distribution of injected sc co2 it is necessary to investigate further the distribution and storage capacity of sc co2 in anisotropic samples with these types of clay interlayers the main aim of this study is to conduct a fundamental core flooding experiment to understand the migration characteristics of sc co2 in a sandstone core sample with a thin clay interlayer a high resolution x ct scanner was used to monitor the whole experiment and using ct images the sc co2 saturation and storage capacity are calculated the results from two samples with obviously different clay interlayer orientations parallel and perpendicular to the flow direction are compared this work will help in providing a reliable basis for evaluating storage safety and storage capacity of target reservoirs 2 materials and methods 2 1 samples reservoir sandstone samples from sichuan basin southwestern china fig 1 a and b were used to conduct the experiments for study the samples were collected from a large outcrop in the penglaizhen formation which belongs to the upper jurassic age according to previous research the samples were developed in a delta front sub facies sedimentary mode guo et al 2018 for comparison two samples containing thin clay interlayers were cored from two adjacent positions of a large outcrop fig 1c in different orientation angles of 3 and 85 between the rock axial direction and the clay interlayer bedding fig 1d and e for convenience in the remainder of this paper the 3 sample with the clay layer nearly parallel to the flow direction is referred to as sample h and the 85 sample with the clay layer nearly perpendicular to the flow direction is referred to as sample v some basic information about both samples is listed in table 1 despite having different bedding angles x ray diffraction xrd results show that sample h and sample v have similar mineral compositions as shown in fig 2 the main minerals are quartz albite muscovite and microcline with a small amount of calcite dolomite chlorite and rutile the estimated mineral composition in the samples are listed in table 2 in addition the pore size distribution measured by nuclear magnetic resonance nmr are similar fig 3 the mercury intrusion porosimetry mip method was not used as it is destructive and influenced by moisture wang and yu 2016 the permeability tested by an ap 608 automated permeameter porosimeter of these two samples using n2 are 307 3 md sample h and 123 3 md sample v respectively the ionic composition of the brine used in this experiment is shown in table 3 iodide is added to the brine to enhance the contrast in the x ct imaging and aid in distinguishing the aqueous phase and the sc co2 phase 2 2 experimental setup fig 4 a is a schematic diagram of the experimental system that consists of three modules a 38 mm x ct transparent core holder fig 4b a fluid injection and production system fig 4c and a heating module fig 4e the core sample is placed in the core holder and the desired confining pressures is applied to the sample with hydraulic oil using an isco syringe pump pressurized brine and sc co2 are delivered to the sample loaded in the core holder at the desired flow rate using two separate isco pumps back pressure is applied on the effluent of the core holder using an isco pump in pressure control mode in reverse to accommodate fluid gas production the core holder is constructed from an x ray transparent composite material of aluminum and carbon fiber with maximum pressure temperature working conditions of 5000 psi and 80 c as shown in fig 4b a medical x ct scanner siemens german located at csiro s facilities in perth western australia with a high speed helical scan system was used to image the interior of the sandstone samples and visualize the behavior of brine and sc co2 inside the sample in real time during core flooding experiments in each scan images were reconstructed at 512 512 pixels and with a 0 4 mm interval between slices the voxel size was 0 125 mm width 0 125 mm height 0 4 mm depth the java based imagej software package was used to process the images generated by the ct scanner for temperature control we used a temperature controller shown in fig 4e to heat the core holder and kept the temperature at 40 c as the flow rate used in the experiments was very slow at 0 5 ml min the gaseous co2 undergoes a phase change to supercritical upon entering the heated core holder 2 3 core flooding experimental procedure 1 for calibrating the saturation values to the ct number a thin walled glass bottle containing air and brine was placed into the core holder in a horizontal configuration the x ct scanner was then used to get the ct numbers of pure air and brine 2 a clean core sample was placed in the core holder in a horizontal configuration and confining pressure was maintained at 580 psi while the core holder was heated to 40 c the ct scanner was used to scan the sample saturated with air and then a vacuum pump was used to vacuum the sample for more than 2 h 3 the confining pressure and back pressure were then set at 1305 psi and 725 psi respectively brine was injected into the sample at a flow rate of 0 5 ml min for 14 h and the x ct scanner was used to scan the sample when it was fully saturated with brine at the end of this injection period 4 the confining pressure and back pressure were then set at 1740 psi and 1160 psi respectively and sc co2 was injected into the sample through an in line water bubbler to prevent the sc co2 from drying out the sample during the flooding at a flow rate of 0 5 ml min the x ct scanner was used to scan the sample when the volumes of injected sc co2 were 0 2 pore volumes pv 0 4 pv 0 6 pv 0 8 pv 1 0 pv 2 0 pv 3 0 pv and so on at 1 0 pv intervals this drainage process lasted for nearly 4 h and was continued until the average ct numbers of each slice were stable 5 pressure from the core holder was decreased to ambient and the sample was removed sample was then put into a soxhlet extractor and methanol was used to clean it for two days afterwards the sample was placed in a drying oven and dried it was then placed into the core holder again and the temperature of the core holder was heated to 40 c and the confining pressure and back pressure were set at 1740 psi and 1160 psi respectively the x ct scanner was used to image the sample saturated with air then the vacuum pump was used on the flooding system and then sc co2 was injected into the sample for half a day the x ct scanner was used to scan the sample saturated with sc co2 6 pressure from the core holder was decreased to ambient and the samples were removed these steps above were repeated for the other sample 2 4 measurement porosity and co2 saturation x rays decay differently as they pass through material with different densities this phenomenon is reflected in differences in ct numbers which can be used to calculate the porosity and co2 saturation of the sample based on ct images a method based on beer s law can be used to measure the porosity saturation from ct numbers of two slice images at the same position obtained with different fluids saturating the porous medium withjack and akervoll 1988 this x ct method is a fast and convenient methodology to map the fluid saturations assuming sufficient contrast in the core samples honarpour 1986 to determine the fluid saturations the following equations are widely used in this area of research and are listed as follows akin and kovscek 2003 krishnamurthy et al 2017 oh et al 2019 1 œï ct bri sat ct dry ct bri ct ari 2 s c o 2 ct exp ct bri sat ct c o 2 sat ct bri sat where œï is the voxel porosity s c o 2 is the degree of co2 saturation ct bri and ct air are the ct numbers for pure brine and air ct bri sat ct dry ct c o 2 sat ct exp are the ct number for brine saturated dry co2 saturated and experimental conditions during the drainage progress respectively 2 5 image post processing imagej software was chosen for post processing the ct images and two main implementations of this software were utilized in this study the first implementation is to obtain an accurate mean ct number for each slice which is then used to calculate porosity and co2 saturation in order to exclude the effect of the sample ct numbers caused by the core sleeve shrink wrap and confining fluid fig 4b calculations were limited to the interior of a concentric circle with a diameter of 36 mm with the core samples being 38 mm in diameter in other words the outer part of the concentric circle was removed from consideration and the average ct numbers were calculated inside the concentric circle the ct numbers are converted to porosity and saturation values based on equations 1 and 2 above this second implementation of the software is to implement the image calculator function in the software with this calculator the ct values from two different images can be subtracted and the change in the ct numbers from one image to another as more pore volumes of sc co2 are injected can be assessed these subtracted images can be used to visualize the migration characteristics of fluid along the direction of the fluid false color imaging was used to enhance contrast and make experimental result more evident 3 results 3 1 porosity calculated based on x ct images the porosity of each slice of two samples is determined with brine and calculated using the above equation 1 as shown in fig 5 the average porosity values for each image from sample h are fairly constant aside from imaging artifacts and capillary effects at the ends of the samples at approximately 16 9 in contrast the average porosity for each slice over the length of sample v is considerably less uniform due to the bedding direction of sample v s clay interlayer being almost perpendicular to the length of the rock there is an obvious drop of porosity at the position of the clay interlayer the calculated average porosity of each image slice for sample v is somewhat lower at approximately 16 0 the differences in the porosity caused by the clay interlayer in sample h is averaged out in each slice and is relatively uniform due to its orientation and this is the main reason why little variation in the porosity is observed for sample h in sample v however the average porosity decreases over a distance of 20 to 30 mm from core inlet the reason for this dispersion is that the actual geological deposition processes that formed this core sample are very complicated and slow resulting in the volume near the thin clay interlayer likely also containing some clay furthermore the clay interlayer is not actually exactly vertical to the axial direction and this will cause the decrease is porosity due to the thin clay interlayer to be smeared over multiple slices this will be discussed in more detail later in the discussion section of this paper 3 2 differential pressure response in the context of core flooding differential pressure is the difference in the pressure values between the inlet and outlet of the core sample and can be measured by a single specialized differential pressure gauge see fig 4a a build up in the differential pressure can be used to estimate when the sc co2 reaches the clay interlayer furthermore pressure measurements can be used to assess the any leakage during the core flooding operations based on previous experiments by other researchers comparing the physical parameters of the samples and experimental conditions khather et al 2018 khather et al 2017 kim et al 2018 oh et al 2017 shojaei et al 2015 with the sample used in this paper the differential pressure curves measured in our experiments are consistent with expectations and we can confidently say that leakage was not evident in these experiments as shown in fig 6 the differential pressure response curve for sample h can be divided into three sections sh s1 sh s2 and sh s3 during section sh s1 the differential pressure increases from 0 6 psi to 1 63 psi rapidly suggesting that the sc co2 has reached the inlet of sample h at a flow rate of 0 5 ml min for sc co2 the gas accumulates at the inlet of sample h until the differential pressure exceeds the capillary entry pressure preventing the migration of sc co2 into the sample at lower pressures section sh s2 shows the sc co2 entering the sample with the differential pressure initially decreases rapidly and then slowly until stabilizing at approximately 1 05 psi this suggests that the sc co2 displaces the brine in relatively large pores with a small capillary entry pressure at first and then displaces the brine next in relatively small pores hosseinzadeh hejazi et al 2019 qian et al 2019 wei et al 2019 section sh s2 begins with an sc co2 injection volume approximately 0 1 pv and ends at approximately 3 0 pv in section sh s3 the final section the differential pressure is fairly constant and the flow is continued to ensure that the saturation distribution has reached equilibrium the differential pressure response curve for sample v is noticeably different than the response curve for samples in several ways the first is that the differential pressure response curve for sample v is divided into four sections sv s1 sv s2 sv s3 and sv s4 the second one is that the differential pressure increases to a higher value of 2 21 psi rapidly in section sv s1 relative to section sh s1 the reason for this difference is that sample v has a higher capillary entry pressure due to the bedding direction being nearly perpendicular to the flooding direction the third and most important difference is that the differential pressure increases initially to a higher value of 2 83 psi in section sv s2 this phenomenon suggests that sc co2 reaches the clay interlayer which is perpendicular to the flooding direction and accumulates before the differential pressure surpasses the capillary entry pressure near the clay interlayer sections sv s3 and sv s4 are similar to sections sh s2 and sh s3 respectively the differential pressure decreases rapidly and then slowly until stabilizing at approximately 1 3 psi when sc co2 displaces the brine the fourth difference is that section sv s3 needs more time to complete starting at 0 36 pv of sc co2 and ending at approximately 5 0 pv in section sv s4 the final section the stabilized differential pressure is slightly higher at 1 44 psi compared to section sh s3 at 1 05 psi which is consistent with sample v having a lower overall permeability relative to sample h 3 3 migration characteristics of sc co2 previous research on sc co2 brine core flooding has shown that in isotropic and homogeneous rock samples a sweep phenomenon tends to dominate alemu et al 2011 while fingering behavior becomes more pronounced in more anisotropic samples ni et al 2019 as the rock core itself exhibits a significant variation in ct number it can be difficult to distinguish between sc co2 and brine with imaging so a contrast agent e g iodide see table 1 is added to the brine solution to allow these phases to be easily differentiated figs 7 and 10 show the ct number distribution during the drainage process inside sample h and sample v respectively in these images based on the principle of ct number the thin clay interlayers being a denser material than the surrounding sandstone are quite evident with a substantially higher ct number fig 7b and 10b show the ct number distribution when the sample is brine saturated the density of brine is higher than sc co2 so samples saturated with brine fig 7b and 10b have larger ct numbers relative to those saturated with sc co2 fig 7j and 10j figs 8 and 11 show the distribution of sc co2 obtained using image subtraction using equation 2 during the drainage process in sample h and v respectively for both figs 8 and 11 the clay interlayer is no longer visible suggesting that the composition of the clay interlayer does not change during the flooding process for sample h fig 8c shows that sc co2 has not reached the outlet when 0 2 pv of sc co2 is injected at 0 4 pv sc co2 begins to appear at the outlet suggesting some degree of finger is occurring fig 8d from the onset as shown in fig 8e to 8j the clay interlayer divides the sc co2 flow into two parts and it is evident that the lower portion is slightly more permeable as the sc co2 channeling is more pronounced in that section as fig 8e to 8j look very similar it is difficult to identify the migration of sc co2 subtraction of sequential images e g subtracting the 3rd image from the 4th image can elucidate the migration characteristics of sc co2 fig 9 as shown in fig 9b to 9d most of the change in ct images occurs before 0 6 pv and after that there is only a slight change after 3 0 pv of sc co2 was injected into sample h fig 9i shows no significant change in sc co2 saturation channel suggesting that the channel formed was sufficient for sc co2 to pass through unimpeded at 0 5 ml min the situation is quite different for sample v as shown in fig 11 corresponding to co2 saturation similar to fig 8 for sample h and 12 corresponding to changes in the co2 saturation during injection intervals the clay interlayer perpendicular to the flow direction acts as a natural barrier preventing the migration of sc co2 sc co2 was almost entirely blocked by the clay interlayer when only 0 2 pv co2 was injected fig 11c breakthrough was evident at 0 4 pv which is consistent with differential pressure data shown in section sv s2 of fig 6 and sc co2 quickly arrived at the outlet fig 11d fig 12 c and 12d suggest that a channel is forming and that the injected sc co2 is not only passing through the sample but is displacing the brine near the channel fig 12e however fig 12g suggests that even after 1 0 pv of sc co2 has passed through the core there is still some further accumulation of sc co2 before the clay interlayer finally in the final images i e fig 11j there is an obvious difference in the distribution of sc co2 before and after the clay interlayer before the clay interlayer the final distribution of sc co2 resembles sweep behavior however after the clay interlayer it appears that fingering is significant the sc co2 passes through the sample along the margin after the clay interlayer suggesting that there is channeling occurring at the surface possible reasons for this will be examined in the discussion section in any case sample v shows a significant buildup of more sc co2 prior to the clay interlayer compared to after the interlayer fig 11j 3 4 sc co2 saturation during displacement of brine the sc co2 saturation of two samples are calculated using the above equation 2 figs 13 and 14 show the change of average sc co2 saturation for each slice over the drainage process of samples h and v respectively for sample h the sc co2 saturation from 45 mm into the sample to the outlet is zero after injection of 0 2 pv sc co2 suggesting that the sc co2 had not channeled sufficiently through the core sample at that stage at 0 4 pv injection of sc co2 the sc co2 saturation increases from 0 04 to 0 17 at 30 mm and increases from zero to 0 02 at the outlet between 0 2 and 0 4 pv the most dramatic increase in the saturation an increase of nearly 162 averaged over the whole sample occurs suggesting that a sc co2 channel is created following this the sc co2 saturation curve moves up gradually across the whole length of the core suggesting the channel that was formed initially is extending during this step from 1 0 to 3 0 pv of injection the sc co2 saturation only increases by a further 28 after the initial channel was created finally the co2 saturation stabilizes gradually after 3 0 pv of sc co2 injected and this step is called channel stabilization and the sc co2 saturation curve does not change appreciably after more sc co2 is injected into the samples at the same flow rate moreover the sc co2 saturation shows a decreasing trend along the length of the core with a saturation of 0 31 at the inlet and 0 05 at the outlet after the drainage has finished this varying co2 saturation curve reflects the fingering phenomenon to some extent the drainage processes in sample h and sample v follow similar steps in terms of channel formation extension and stabilization however the co2 saturation curve of sample v is quite different from that of sample h as shown in fig 14 the co2 saturation curve is divided into two parts after injecting 0 2 pv sc co2 at first the dividing line at approximately 23 mm into sample v is the location of the clay interlayer as discussed earlier the sc co2 breaks through the clay interlayer during 0 2 to 0 4 pv portion of the sc co2 injection process with an increase in the co2 saturation value occurring as with the breakthrough a larger differential pressure is required for this step as mentioned above after this initial channel creation the next two steps of sample v are similar to those of sample h however due to the clay interlayer the curve is divided into two distinct parts throughout the whole drainage process there is a rapid decrease near 23 mm from the inlet and the final average co2 saturation is approximately 0 36 before the clay interlayer while it is 0 21 after the interlayer overall after the drainage process is completed the clay interlayer with less than 1 mm thickness has a dramatic impact on the sc co2 saturation distribution 4 discussion zhu et al 2013 pointed out that there is very little reaction between co2 brine mixtures and minerals in sandstone during the very short timeframe of a typical core flooding experiment furthermore the clay interlayer is no longer visible in the co2 saturation images figs 8 and 11 suggesting that the clay interlayer does not change in co2 composition during the flooding process for these two reasons this paper does not consider chemical reactions of co2 brine with either the sandstone or clay interlayer the low porosity permeability characteristics of the thin clay interlayers dominate the effects of co2 distribution and flow in the two core samples for both samples the channel formation for flow of co2 seems to follow the same three steps channel creation channel extension and channel stabilization channel creation occurs when the injected sc co2 reaches the outlet and builds an initial channel channel extension occurs when the sc co2 injection continues enlarging the initial channel by dissolving and displacing the brine near the initial channel during the creation and extension processes the flow rate of sc co2 from the outlet is different than the flow rate of sc co2 into the inlet during the channel creation the differential pressure between the inlet and outlet slowly decreases and stabilizes as the total capillary pressure that needs to be surpassed decreases during the channel stabilization phase the flow rates at the inlet and outlet are the same and the sc co2 saturation distribution does not change the sc co2 displaces the brine however this effect is uneven due to the existence of the clay interlayer miao et al 2019 despite the similarities in the channel formation there are several differences in the drainage processes for both samples and the evolution of the sc co2 saturation changes are quite different between sample h and sample v simply due to the orientation of the clay interlayer the saturation distribution curves as a function of length along the core sample i e figs 13 and 14 for both samples are very different for sample h it is almost a line with a negative slope while sample v is nearly a line whose slope is almost zero before and after the clay interlayer with an abrupt change between these two lines representing the clay interlayer initially as sc co2 is injected into the sample v from the inlet the sandstone part before the clay interlayer contains substantially more sc co2 than after the clay interlayer fingering behavior is observed very quickly following co2 injection in the sample whose bedding is parallel to the flooding direction i e sample h the second difference is that the values of terminal average saturation for sample h and sample v are 0 210 and 0 272 respectively the average saturation of sample h is 29 5 lower than that of sample v by comparing the progression in figs 13 and 14 the third difference is that for a 0 5 ml min flow rate of sc co2 sample v takes almost twice as long to form a stable channel the experimental results confirm that the clay interlayer has a nonnegligible influence on the behavior of fluid inside the sample the influence of surface flow i e leaking fluid between the surface of the core and the core sleeve can be excluded after considering differential pressure responses during the sc co2 injection 4 1 effects of clay interlayer on the migration characteristics of sc co2 previous studies indicated that the distribution of sc co2 in the sample depends on sub core scale porosity permeability and capillary pressure zhang et al 2014 the porosity and permeability of both samples were tested by an ap 608 automated permeameter porosimeter the pore size distribution of two samples were measured by nmr and the porosity of each slice were calculated based on x ct images the results show that the average porosity table 1 and pore size distribution fig 3 of the two samples are almost the same however the orientation of the bedding layer causes a significant difference in n2 permeability between the two samples with sample v having significantly less permeability relative to sample h see table 1 this difference is attributed to the orientation of the clay layer and is not a result of differences in the porosity or permeability of the homogeneous portions of either sample in otherwise similar rock samples porosity typically has a strong correlation with the permeability and capillary pressure a lower porosity tends to result in a lower permeability and higher capillary force an absolute permeability model that relates porosity and permeability without considering chemical reactions is given by the kozeny carman equation krause et al 2011a krause et al 2011b peng et al 2014 3 k œÜ 3 s 1 œÜ 2 where k and œÜ are the permeability and the porosity of each voxel and s is a scaling factor used to ensure the average permeability of each voxel is equal to the sample permeability when co2 undergoes piston displacement of brine a crescent shaped boundary between the phases form in the two phase flow area the pressure on both sides of the boundary is discontinuous and this pressure difference is attributed to capillary forces the equations for the capillary pressure p c and the entry pressure p entry are bachu and bennion 2009 zhang and yu 2016 4 p c œÉ c o s Œ∏ œÜ k j s w 5 p entry 2 œÉ c o s Œ∏ r where œÉ is the interfacial tension between brine and co2 Œ∏ is the contact angle between brine and co2 r is the maximum radius of the interconnected pore throat within the sample a higher porosity generally correlated with a larger r and j s w is a correlation used to describe the fluid saturation and capillary pressure a 3d model of sample h has been reconstructed from the ct scanner images and six slices were chosen to show the porosity along sample h fig 15 the bottom of each slice has a higher porosity and hence it is more permeable relative to the other parts since the extension direction of clay interlayer development in sample h is nearly parallel to the flooding direction the clay interlayer in sample h plays the role of guiding fluid flow when sc co2 reaches the inlet of the sample the almost impermeable clay interlayer divides the sc co2 into two parts i e an upper part and a lower part the sandstone part below the clay interlayer is slightly more permeable than that above the clay interlayer giving rise to more prevalent fingering in the lower zone relative to the upper zone see fig 9b and c the fingering phenomenon occurring on either side of the clay interlayer in many ways mimics the drainage in core samples with bedding layers zhang et al 2013 a 3d model of sample v has also similarly been constructed by the ct images and six slices were cut to show the porosity along the sample v fig 16 the sample was divided into two parts the interior of the sample and near the sample surface as shown in each slice of sample h the concentric circle representing the interior and the core boundary have diameters of 27 4 and 36 mm respectively among these slices two slices are before the interlayer slice one slice corresponds to the clay interlayer and three slices are after the clay interlayer each of these has a voxel porosity near the surface which is smaller than in the interior of the core this may be due to the large external disturbance of the rock sample during the drilling of sandstone resulting in greater porosity at the core sample inlet shown on the first slice of the sample the voxel porosity in the interior of sample v is 15 5 which is smaller than that near the surface 19 2 for the clay interlayer shown on the third slice of the sample the voxel porosity ranges from 7 3 to 11 7 with an average porosity of 9 2 based on the images these porosity values are indicative of a natural barrier for sc co2 migration in sample v assuming the same s factor the calculated permeability eq 3 gives a value for the inlet sandstone slice that is nearly eight times than that of the clay interlayer slice furthermore based on the porosity differences observed in the inlet sandstone slice the permeability near the sample surface is approximately twice that in interior of the sample capillary pressure effects are also a significant controlling factor in the volume prior to the clay interlayer because tabular or flaky minerals often form parallel to bedding in sedimentary rocks the effective r value eq 5 is smaller in sample v where the flooding direction is nearly perpendicular to the sedimentary bedding compared to sample h initially compared to sample h sample v requires a larger differential pressure due to a higher p entry needed when the sc co2 reaches the sample fig 6 with the area near the sample surface having a higher porosity and being more permeable than the area within the sample the r value is bigger in the high porosity area than in the low porosity area resulting in sc co2 preferentially flowing near the surface as it has a smaller p entry this is confirmed by fig 12c which shows a selective increase in the sc co2 saturation near the surface after breakthrough the differential pressure drops slightly until the sc co2 reaches some resistance associated with the clay interlayer and the differential pressure rises again at approximately 0 2 pv injection see section sv s2 in fig 6 at this point the sc co2 saturation nearly reaches equilibrium upstream of the clay interlayer after a further buildup in the differential pressure between 0 2 pv and 0 4 pv injected sc co2 the entry pressure associated with the clay interlayer is overcome as shown in fig 10b the thickness of the clay interlayer is not uniform and there are weak points developed on the clay interlayer indicated by the black circles the sc co2 could establish a channel is this volume where the entry pressure is smaller meanwhile due to the larger porosity near the surface of the sample v this could be the reason why the sc co2 preferentially flows near the surface after breaking through the interlayer after that the sc co2 displaces the brine near the previous channel and the sc co2 channel expands this channel extension continues with ongoing injection and the differential pressure and flow channel stabilizes since the orientation of the clay interlayer in sample v is perpendicular to the flooding direction the clay interlayer in sample v plays the role of a barrier when the sc co2 reaches the clay interlayer it is blocked initially and a larger differential pressure was needed to overcome the p entry for the clay interlayer or the region of the sample near it the clay interlayer divided sample v into two parts when sc co2 reaches the core surface it is injected fairly homogeneously over the cross section area however when sc co2 breaks through the clay interlayer for the sandstone part behind the clay interlayer sc co2 is injected into the parts through long narrow holes fig 17 the drainage process resembles sweep behavior before the clay interlayer however after the clay interlayer fingering behavior seems to dominate and after channel creation miscibility of sc co2 and brine is an important way of channel expansion the clay interlayer in sample v provided a relatively closed area for miscibility while it only happened near the initial channel in sample h 4 2 effects of clay interlayer on the sc co2 displacement efficiency and storage capacity the displacement efficiency and storage capacity are amongst the most important parameters for the practical implementation of geological co2 storage for the ccus industry aljamaan et al 2017 using the x ct images the storage capacity associated with each slice can be calculated by multiplying the average sc co2 saturation by the pore space volume for each slice i e the average porosity of the slice multiple by the total volume of the slice according to the equation 1 the storage efficiency is just the average sc co2 saturation the two primary factors influencing displacement efficiency and storage capacity are the presence of the clay interlayer and the relationship between the deposition direction and flooding direction the co2 displacement efficiency and storage capacity for both samples at 0 4 pv and drainage completion are given in figs 18 and 19 consistent with the discussion above the co2 saturation curve for sample v fig 14 has a distinct jump lower at a distance of 23 mm along the sample associated with the clay interlayer at 0 2 and 0 4 pv as the co2 mainly moves forward and expanded the flow channel after breaking through the clay interlayer this jump becomes less distinct after injection of more co2 sample h does not have this effect as the orientation of the clay interlayer is parallel to flow direction for this reason the effect of the relationship between the deposition direction and flooding direction on the storage efficiency can be ascertained by comparing the storage efficiencies and capacities at 0 4 pv when the front part of only 20 mm is selected for assessment fig 18 shows that the displacement efficiency and storage capacity are more uniform when the flooding direction is nearly perpendicular to these bedding direction i e sample v presumably due to sweep behavior in this volume of the core in contrast the displacement efficiency and storage capacity show a quick drop along the sample length when the injection direction is parallel to the bedding direction i e sample h due to fingering behavior dominating over the whole length near the inlet at a distance from 0 to 3 7 mm the displacement efficiency and storage capacity for sample v are higher than those for sample h the reason for this is ascertained by comparing fig 8d with fig 11d showing that the fingering phenomenon occurred earlier when the injection direction is parallel to the bedding direction the average displacement efficiency is 0 26 for sample v while it is only 0 20 for sample h the average displacement efficiency for sample v is 30 greater than sample h when only the first 20 mm section is considered and this effect could become more pronounced if different geometries are used e g a longer sample for the first 20 mm the average storage capacity of sample v in each slice is 0 0189 ml and that of sample h is only 0 0156 ml 21 greater as mentioned above the ap 608 automated permeameter porosimeter and nmr were used to obtain the porosity and pore size distribution for the two samples the results showed that sample v and sample h have a very similar porosity and pore size distribution table 1 and fig 3 in fact the porosity of sample v is a little smaller than that of sample h and because the t2 spectrum of the sample v is to the right the sample v has more smaller pores than sample h in addition the porosity distributions of two samples measured by ct images also showed that the sample v has few pores than sample h see fig 5 but the result was that sample v stored more sc co2 than sample h highlighting the impact of the clay interlayer for sample h the function of the clay interlayer is more like a shunt and the clay interlayer divides the injected sc co2 into two parts and no sc co2 appears near the clay interlayer as a result in many ways the displacement efficiency and storage capacity are quite similar to a sandstone sample without a clay interlayer berg et al 2013 as shown in fig 19 for sample h the displacement efficiency and storage capacity of each slice near the inlet are 0 286 and 0 017 ml respectively while these two values are 0 056 and 0 004 ml near the outlet for sample v the clay interlayer acted as a barrier impeding the migration of sc co2 and propagation of pressure sc co2 accumulated when it migrated close to the surface of this barrier as such the displacement efficiency and storage capacity along sample v before and after the clay interlayer are not the same before the clay interlayer the average displacement efficiency and capacity of each slice are 0 364 and 0 027 ml respectively after the clay interlayer the average displacement efficiency and capacity of each slice are 0 207 and 0 016 ml respectively due to the presence of a clay interlayer of less than one millimeter the displacement efficiency and storage capacity decreased by 43 14 and 40 74 respectively considering the effects of the clay interlayer and the relationship between the deposition direction and flooding direction the core of the anticline is a favorable site for co2 storage when sc co2 is injected from the core of the anticline the direction of flooding is parallel to the direction of bedding expansion and sc co2 will first move in the direction of bedding similar to the behavior in sample h when sc co2 reaches the flanks of the anticline the direction of flooding is nearly perpendicular to the direction of bedding like that in sample v due to the existence of multiple clay interlayers fig 1c the sc co2 will be blocked by the flanks which will increase the storage capacity and integrity 5 conclusions in this paper core flooding experiments are conducted to investigate the migration of sc co2 in the anisotropic sandstone with a thin clay interlayer by x ct monitoring two samples cored in different directions are saturated with iodide containing brine for contrast purposes and then sc co2 is injected at a flow rate of 0 5 ml min these drainage processes are all imaged using x ct and the sc co2 saturation values of each image slice are calculated the following main conclusions can be summarized from the experiment the clay interlayer has a low porosity low permeability and high capillary pressure characteristics compared to the nearby sandstone part the sandstone part near the clay interlayer has more clay content than that farther from the clay interlayer sc co2 avoids the clay interlayer during the drainage and the clay interlayer does not change in composition during the flooding process after drainage for a short time the effects of clay interlayer on the migration characteristics of sc co2 depend on the different bedding angles of the clay interlayer the clay interlayer is like a shunt to separate the sc co2 flow into different parts without joints when the injection direction is parallel to the clay interlayer and the fingering phenomenon happens in different parts while the clay interlayer is a barrier which prevents sc co2 moving ahead and affects the pressure propagation when the injection direction is nearly perpendicular to the clay interlayer before the clay interlayer the final distribution of sc co2 resembles sweep behavior however after the clay interlayer it appears that fingering is significant the co2 saturation curves of two samples are quite different due to the different bedding angles of the clay interlayer with the corresponding effects of clay interlayer on migration characteristics of sc co2 the sc co2 saturation curves show a quick drop along the sample length when the injection direction is parallel to the bedding direction however when the injection direction is vertical to the bedding direction the sc co2 saturation curve is a different value before and after the clay interlayer but is actually quite uniform in each section the relationship between the deposition direction of the clay interlayer and the flooding direction strongly influences the displacement efficiency and storage capacity for the scenario investigated in this paper the average displacement efficiency is 30 greater when the deposition direction and flooding direction are perpendicular compared to the case when the deposition direction and flooding direction are parallel when a clay interlayer less than one millimeter thick is perpendicular to the flooding direction a noticeable decrease in the displacement efficiency and storage capacity are observed downstream of the clay interlayer declaration of
