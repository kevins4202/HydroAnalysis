2575,how precipitation responds to global warming has drawn much interest from the scientific community however as one of the important properties of precipitation changes in the precipitation system scale have rarely been studied the latest retrospective merged satellite precipitation product has provided a great opportunity to investigate quasi global precipitation system scale changes this study uses the integrated multi satellite retrievals for global precipitation measurement imerg data during 2001 2020 to investigate quasi global precipitation system scale changes our results indicate that generally quasi global precipitation system scales exhibit a significant increasing trend which is more significant in winter and spring than that in summer and autumn over both hemispheres the scale of nearly all precipitation systems over land regions has increased over the last two decades in oceanic regions precipitation system scales increase over tropical oceans but decrease over subtropical oceans medium scale precipitation systems 100 1000 km significantly increase in scale and decrease in frequency while large scale precipitation systems significantly increase in frequency which both lead to a quasi global increase in the precipitation system scale diagnostic investigation based on atmospheric analysis reveals that an increase in atmospheric stability tends to suppress local convective precipitation while an increase in the total column water vapor could help maintain and enhance precipitation system scale which jointly contribute to quasi global precipitation system scale increase keywords precipitation precipitation system scale imerg global climate change data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction precipitation is one of the most common weather events in our daily lives as a vital component of water and energy cycles precipitation plays an important role in meteorological and hydrological research hou et al 2014 kidd and huffman 2011 trenberth et al 2003 meanwhile precipitation is a climatic variable that varies from year to year and over decades trenberth 2011 currently with the increasing attention to global climate change studies on precipitation changes have been of great concern among the scientific community longobardi and villani 2010 vincent et al 2005 an enhanced understanding of precipitation changes can provide important implications not only for analysis of past climate change but also for projection of future global and regional hydrological cycles gu et al 2016 treydte et al 2006 moreover accurate knowledge of precipitation change is essential to society since precipitation plays an important role in disaster prevention and mitigation water resource management and agriculture mondal et al 2018 scientists have already obtained several basic understandings of precipitation changes in recent decades however current precipitation change studies were mostly concentrated on the precipitation amount gu et al 2016 kazemzadeh et al 2021 wang et al 2016 westra et al 2013 frequency golian et al 2019 jung et al 2011 liu et al 2005 intensity christensen and christensen 2003 prein et al 2017a yuan and houze 2010 duration brommer et al 2007 li et al 2011 and extreme events donat et al 2016 prein et al 2017b yin et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 these previous studies all depicted precipitation from fixed places i e weather stations pixels and grid boxes which neglects the co occurrence of precipitation between adjacent stations pixels and grid boxes but unlike other meteorological fields e g temperature precipitation is a discontinuous variable and presents in the form of systems with certain spatial extents improving our knowledge of precipitation systems is crucial to elucidate thermodynamic and kinetic features of precipitation analyze the different atmospheric and hydrological impacts of precipitation systems with varying scales and improve the precipitation simulation accuracy by optimizing the precipitation parameterization schemes zhang and wang 2021 moreover in regard to precipitation that could cause flood disasters the spatial extents of precipitation systems affect the sizes of the potential flooding regions konrad 2001 which is highly significant for flood risk evaluation additionally precipitation system scale could also affect various hydrological processes gao and fang 2019 nunes et al 2006 ten veldhuis et al 2018 knowing the changes of precipitation system scales could help to enhance the hydrological modeling therefore changes in the precipitation systems such as the precipitation system scale should also be studied however in the past due to the limitation of rain gauge measurements such as the spatial inhomogeneity and sparse coverage in remote regions kidd et al 2017 the rain gauge precipitation estimates are more proper for analyzing local rainfall thus changes of precipitation s spatial characteristics have been rarely studied recently with the development of precipitation observations especially the satellite based precipitation observations kidd and levizzani 2011 kucera et al 2013 yang et al 2013 scientists began to investigate changes of spatial characteristics of precipitation some studies used ground radar and found that the spatial size of precipitation events can increase with increasing temperature berg et al 2013 lochbihler et al 2017 but most of the ground based radar are regionally distributed and hard to conduct worldwide study with suitably calibrated and densely distributed datasets in terms of worldwide studies tan et al 2021 used a retrospective satellite based precipitation dataset namely precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks climate data record persiann cdr ashouri et al 2015 and reported an increase in the spatial areas of extreme precipitation events over 1983 2018 meanwhile some other studies investigated the changes of the spatial areas of mesoscale convective systems mcss or storms via model simulation experiments chang et al 2016 guinard et al 2015 matte et al 2022 prein et al 2017a rather than based on actual precipitation observation data therefore research remains needed to comprehensively quantify spatial scale changes in all precipitation systems worldwide by using a long term high resolution and spatially consistent observational precipitation dataset which is the main motivation of our study the global precipitation measurement gpm mission is considered the next generation of precipitation measurement programs hou et al 2014 with a high temporal spatial resolution improved sensors more integrated satellite constellation and quasi global coverage gpm products are expected to be the one of the most advanced satellite precipitation estimates up to now hou et al 2014 skofronick jackson et al 2017 its primary level 3 gridded product namely the integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm imerg dataset also provides many advantages in studying global precipitation systems such as an enhanced light rain detection ability at the edge of precipitation systems improved spatial consistency and advanced algorithm capturing precipitation system motion huffman et al 2019 zhang and wang 2021 in recent years the newest version of imerg products used retrospective processing and extended the coverage period to nearly 20 years started in june 2000 which could offer new insights into the climatological study of precipitation li et al 2021b tang et al 2020 for the first time this study uses the latest retrospective merged satellite precipitation data imerg to investigate worldwide precipitation system scale changes over the last two decades furthermore seasonal and regional differences are investigated finally potential contributing factors that may affect precipitation system scale changes are identified 2 data and methods 2 1 data this study employs the latest version of imerg products namely version v06b final run with a temporal resolution of 30 min and a spatial resolution of 0 1 0 1 huffman et al 2019 the processing procedures of the product are as follows first the precipitation estimates from various satellite passive microwave pmw sensors which comprise the gpm constellation are computed using the 2017 version of the goddard profiling algorithm gprof2017 then these data from multiple sources are uniformly calibrated to the gpm combined ku radar radiometer algorithm corra product next the merged pmw estimates are processed based on the climate prediction center cpc morphing kalman filter cmorph kf lagrangian time interpolation scheme and also merged with infrared ir based precipitation estimates via the precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks cloud classification system persiann ccs recalibration scheme finally the data are adjusted with the global precipitation climatology project gpcp satellite gauge product therefore due to the advanced sensors dual frequency precipitation radar dpr and gpm microwave imager gmi onboard the gpm core observatory uniform calibration of estimates retrieved from other sensors in imerg and advanced merging algorithms combining the advantages of many previous algorithms imerg is regarded as a satellite precipitation product with suitable quality asong et al 2017 li et al 2021a tang et al 2020 it should also be noted that although the retrospective imerg product encompasses the transition of the core observatory from the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm kummerow et al 1998 to the gpm mission it has been estimated that this transition did not cause a notable difference in imerg performance between the trmm era before june 2014 and gpm era after june 2014 indicating that imerg data remain suitable for hydro climatological studies li et al 2021b tang et al 2020 in this study the selected study period spans two full decades from 2001 to 2020 the selected study areas range from 60 n to 60 s which is the native spatial range of the gpm mission and for the purpose of preventing the missing data at higher latitudes due to snow and ice huffman et al 2019 moreover meteorological parameters of the temperature and total column water vapor with a resolution of 0 25 0 25 are obtained from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf re analysis version 5 product era5 hersbach et al 2020 these meteorological variables are adopted to analyze the possible contributing factors that may influence changes in the precipitation system scale 2 2 methods 2 2 1 characterization of the precipitation system scale in this study 0 1 mm h is chosen as the precipitation threshold considering that misjudgment could occur in light precipitation detection resulting from the employed morphing and calibration algorithms li et al 2021b liu and zipser 2015 tapiador et al 2020 in addition since the hourly scale is sufficient for climatological research on the precipitation system scale half hourly imerg data are accumulated into hourly data to reduce the calculation amount the precipitation system is defined as the contiguous rainy area on an hourly basis which is used in most precipitation system extraction investigations in related studies berg et al 2013 fu et al 2020 moseley et al 2016 prein et al 2017a zhang and wang 2021 zhou et al 2019 in certain studies there may occur additional steps in precipitation system characterization for particular purposes for example zhou et al 2019 included some separate precipitation cells in large systems by defining a distance threshold and time interval to track extreme precipitation events and prein et al 2017a used a high precipitation threshold mask to focus only on regions with high precipitation rates in this study since we aim to comprehensively analyze changes in the precipitation system scale based on snapshots of all precipitation systems worldwide no additional identification restrictions are added based on the above definition first we calculate the area of each precipitation system second we use the square root of the precipitation system area as the precipitation system scale rather than directly use the system area for further analysis since other meteorological variables used in this study are all one dimensional furthermore to better investigate the characteristics of quasi global precipitation system scales we employ both grid and system based methods to conduct a comprehensive analysis specifically the grid based method records the scale of all precipitation systems where each grid box is located at each hour while system based method simply records the scale of each precipitation system at each hour the most important difference between the two methods is whether assigning the precipitation system scale to each grid box within the system or analyzing the system scale as a whole it should be noted that these two methods do not contradict each other and are used for different study purposes the grid based method could help to obtain the geographic distribution and regional differences and could be more easily combined with other gridded atmospheric factors zhang and wang 2021 while the system based method is more consistent with the natural spatial characteristics of precipitation since precipitation presents in the form of systems in nature 2 2 2 detection of changes in the precipitation system scale to detect changes in the precipitation system scale first median values rather than average values of the precipitation system scale are used to represent the mean state of the precipitation system scale over specific time periods such as annual and seasonal median values this is because the magnitude difference of system scales could be relatively large therefore the median value is more appropriate as an indicator to represent the mean state of the spatial extent of precipitation systems which has been previously employed tan et al 2021 zhang and wang 2021 then we use sen s slope method to investigate the long term trends of the precipitation system scale sen 1968 in addition to statistical significance testing via the nonparametric mann kendall trend test method mann 1945 generally sen s slope method combined with the mann kendall trend test method is widely used to estimate monotonic trends of time series data especially in many climatological studies basso et al 2021 mao et al 2022 wang et al 2020 westra et al 2013 2 2 3 characterization of the atmospheric stability in this study we also aim to determine the possible contributing factors that may affect precipitation system scale changes one of the meteorological factors namely the atmospheric stability as is defined as the difference in potential temperature θ between the upper 300 hpa and lower 900 hpa levels of the troposphere based on previous studies sharmila and walsh 2018 tu et al 2021 1 as θ 300 θ 900 where θ300 and θ900 denote the potential temperature at 300 and 900 hpa respectively the potential temperature θ can be defined as 2 θ t p 0 p r c p where t denotes the temperature k p0 denotes the reference pressure which is usually chosen as 1000 hpa p denotes the atmospheric pressure r denotes the gas constant and cp denotes the specific heat capacity under a constant pressure generally an exponent r cp value of 2 7 is usually selected for air 3 results 3 1 grid based analysis 3 1 1 long term changes in the precipitation system scale based on the introduced grid based method we obtain the geographic distribution of the precipitation system scale within a quasi global domain during the last two decades fig 1 shows the spatial distribution of the annual average precipitation amount fig 1a and median precipitation system scale fig 1b during the period of 2001 2020 in general the precipitation system scales over oceanic regions are larger than those over land regions the largest system scales are observed over mid and high latitude oceans owing to the occurrence of extratropical cyclones precipitation systems over the intertropical convergence zone itcz are also large with abundant precipitation amount which could be attributed to the frequent large mcss liu and zipser 2015 zhang and wang 2021 another possible reason for the differences in precipitation system scale between the oceanic and land regions is the processing procedure of the imerg data the precipitation estimates over land regions are further adjusted by the monthly gauge analyses huffman et al 2019 while there are very few stations over oceanic regions regarding the changes in precipitation system scale we obtain the spatial distribution of the annual trend of the precipitation system scale based on the annual median precipitation system scale where each grid box is located fig 1c generally the results illustrate a dominance of increasing trends over decreasing trends in quasi global precipitation system scale changes negative trends are found to occur over specific subtropical oceans including the northern pacific ocean and northern and southern high latitude atlantic ocean where the median precipitation system scales are larger than approximately 800 km fig 1b this result may indicate the changes in the spatial extents of subtropical cyclones that often occur over these subtropical oceans catto et al 2012 catto et al 2015 papritz et al 2014 in contrast over some midlatitude and tropical oceans the changes in precipitation system scale exhibit positive trends especially over the indian ocean western pacific ocean near the maritime continent and eastern pacific ocean near central america the results seem to be quite different from those revealed in previous studies that investigated precipitation amount and frequency changes gu et al 2016 kazemzadeh et al 2021 ren et al 2013 indicating that different precipitation properties could have different variation trends in the last decades fig 2 a1 and b1 illustrate time series of median annual precipitation system scales over the northern and southern hemispheres during the period of 2001 2020 generally the precipitation system scale exhibits increasing trends over the two hemispheres specifically the northern hemisphere is characterized by an increasing trend of 15 32 km per decade which is also statistically significant as determined with the mann kendall trend test method in contrast the increasing trend is larger over the southern hemisphere at 19 65 km per decade but is not statistically significant tested by the mann kendall trend test method the hemispheric difference could be explained by the land ocean contrast since the northern hemisphere is covered by more lands and the increasing trends in precipitation system scales are more significant over land regions to investigate precipitation system scale changes in different seasons four seasons are defined as december february djf march may mam june august jja and september november son figs 2a2 5 and b2 5 illustrate time series of median precipitation system scales at the seasonal scale over the northern and southern hemispheres during the period of 2001 2020 the results indicate that the precipitation system scale exhibits increasing trends during all seasons over both hemispheres in terms of seasonal variations the precipitation system scales over both hemispheres are characterized by more significant increasing trends during winter and spring than those during summer and autumn with the highest increase rate up to 22 62 km per decade in djf over the northern hemisphere and up to 41 27 km per decade in son over the southern hemisphere 3 1 2 regional differences in changes in the precipitation system scale to further investigate the regional differences in precipitation system scale changes first we calculate regional median values of precipitation system scale at the annual time scale in nine continental regions during the period of 2001 2020 fig 3 here the continental regions are divided according to the previous study trenberth and zhang 2018 specifically the regions include north asia 30 59 n 50 150 e south asia 10 30 n 60 150 e australia 40 10 s 110 155 e maritime continent 10 s 10 n 90 165 e north america 25 59 n 125 50 w central america 0 25 n 110 40 w south america 49 s 0 90 30 w europe 40 59 n 15 w 50 e and africa 35 s 35 n 20 w 40 e in general fig 3 shows that the precipitation system scale over all the nine regions has increased over the last two decades the highest increase rates occur over south asia and the maritime continent at 60 21 and 42 62 km per decade respectively which can be likely attributed to the increase in the spatial extents of mcss over these regions feng et al 2016 prein et al 2017a in contrast the changes in precipitation system scale over north america and central america are not statistically significant and the trends appear to be lowest over north america and africa moreover the seasonal variation in the trends of the precipitation system scale over these nine continental regions is shown in table 1 the results show that the precipitation system scales over north asia maritime continent north america south america and europe have increasing trends in all four seasons although some of the changes are not statistically significant apart from these regions precipitation system scales over south asia are characterized by largest rising rate in djf by 90 46 km per decade but decrease non significantly in mam precipitation system scales in australia only decrease in jja and increase in other three seasons while precipitation system scales in africa only decrease in djf although these decreasing trends are both not statistically significant as for central america changes of precipitation system scales over this region are not statistically significant in all seasons based on the above results revealed in fig 1c and 3 it seems that nearly all the significant changes in the precipitation system scale over land regions involve positive trends therefore we further examine the statistical significance and trend direction of the precipitation system scale changes over continental regions fig 4 at the continental scale the results reveal that 25 34 36 29 7 89 39 93 13 76 49 21 33 60 17 06 and 31 53 of the grid boxes are observed to indicate significant trends over north asia south asia australia maritime continent north america central america south america europe and africa respectively fig 4a among these grid boxes with significant trends positive trends account for more than 95 of the total grid boxes over nearly all regions except for north america fig 4b a positive trend of the precipitation system scale is found to occur most frequently over south asia 99 48 and australia 99 22 with the lowest frequency over north america 84 85 the results further indicate the dominance of significant positive trends of the precipitation system scale over most continental regions which may provide meaningful impacts for hydrologic systems and populations there such as the impact on the potential areas of flood regions 3 2 system based analysis to investigate precipitation system scale changes in detail we choose to perform further system based analysis first we categorize the quasi global precipitation systems into 100 km 100 1000 km and 1000 km systems according to the scale then we calculate the annual frequency and median system scale of the precipitation systems with different scales during the period of 2001 2020 as shown in fig 5a and 5b respectively here the frequency is defined as the number of precipitation systems in all hours fig 5a and 5b show that the frequency of small scale precipitation systems 100 km increased and the median scale slightly decreased in contrast 100 1000 km precipitation systems exhibit a significant decreasing trend of the frequency and an increasing trend of the median scale among precipitation systems with 1000 km scales the trend in the frequency is positive and that in the median scale is not statistically significant the results indicate medium scale precipitation systems 100 1000 km significantly increase in scale and decrease in frequency while large scale precipitation systems significantly increase in frequency which both lead to a quasi global increase in the precipitation system scale then we divide the last two decades into 2001 2010 and 2011 2020 and compare the frequency distribution of the precipitation system scale between these two decades as shown in fig 6 the results show that the most obvious difference in frequency distribution between the two decades is observed at the frequency of the precipitation systems with scales larger than 2000 km these super large precipitation systems occur more frequently during the period of 2011 2020 than the previous decade of 2001 2010 which may be another reason why the quasi global precipitation system scale has increased over the past two decades 3 3 potential contributing factors it is also important to determine why the quasi global precipitation system scale has increased over the past two decades since precipitation changes are mainly attributed to thermodynamic and dynamical changes chang et al 2016 chou et al 2009 held and soden 2006 seager et al 2010 we examine two related meteorological variables namely the total column water vapor integrated from the surface to the top of the atmosphere and the atmospheric stability between the upper 300 hpa and lower 900 hpa levels of the troposphere during the period of 2001 2020 fig 7 shows the time series of the atmospheric stability and total column water vapor as well as their relationships with the precipitation system scale here the spearman s rank correlation coefficient is used to calculate the relationships of the precipitation system scale with the potential contributing factors from the perspective of dynamic changes fig 7a shows a significant increasing trend in atmospheric stability which is consistent with the results reported in previous studies sharmila and walsh 2018 tu et al 2021 furthermore the correlation coefficient between the time series of the atmospheric stability and precipitation system scale is 0 82 which is significant at the 0 05 significance level the results indicate that one possible mechanism behind the increase in quasi global precipitation system scale could be that the increase in atmospheric stability may tend to suppress convective motion and hence less local convective precipitation may occur moreover fig 7b illustrates that there also exists a significant rising trend in the total column water vapor which has been widely studied under the background of global warming as warmer air attains a higher water holding capacity according to the clausius clapeyron cc equation chou et al 2013 wentz et al 2007 the correlation coefficient between the time series of total column water vapor and precipitation system scale reaches 0 78 which is significant at the 0 05 significance level the results indicate that from the perspective of thermodynamic changes more water vapor content in the atmosphere triggered by the increasing temperature could help to maintain or even enhance precipitation system scale which could subsequently lead to the increase in the quasi global precipitation system scale the annual time series of the atmospheric stability and total column water vapor over each hemisphere as well as land only and ocean only domains are shown in figs 8 and 9 respectively in addition their correlation coefficients with the precipitation system scale are summarized in table 2 the results demonstrate that both the atmospheric stability and total column water vapor over each hemisphere exhibit increasing trends fig 8 and both these quantities are all positively correlated with the precipitation system scale table 2 similar phenomena are found over land and ocean only domains fig 9 it is worth noting that the correlation of the precipitation system scale with the atmospheric stability is stronger over the land only domain with a correlation coefficient of 0 78 while the correlation with the total column water vapor is stronger over the ocean only domain with a correlation coefficient of 0 73 this could probably be explained by the fact that the dynamic effects on local convective precipitation suppression are more obvious over land regions while the thermodynamic changes that maintain and enhance precipitation system scale are more evident over oceanic regions 4 discussion with the increasing attention to global climate change precipitation changes have been widely studied since precipitation is closely related to the temperature as expressed in the cc equation one of the most obvious phenomena drawing considerable attention is that global warming is causing more extreme precipitation donat et al 2016 prein et al 2017b yin et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 recently studies have found that in addition to the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation events the spatial extent of extreme precipitation has also increased in recent decades matte et al 2022 tan et al 2021 wasko et al 2016 against this background the results obtained in our study provide additional insights illustrating that not only the extreme precipitation events but also the quasi global precipitation systems have increased significantly in spatial scales other than the observed increase in extreme precipitation events there exist other typical viewpoints on global precipitation changes researchers have proposed that dry areas become drier and wet regions become wetter which is often described as dry gets drier and wet gets wetter held and soden 2006 huang et al 2013 other scientists support the view that in the tropics rainfall increases where the sea surface temperature sst increases beyond the average sst value which is often described as warmer gets wetter chadwick et al 2013 xie et al 2010 similar conclusions are found in our study whereby large scale precipitation systems have become more frequent and larger which can be described as large gets larger which is particularly observed over tropical regions such as the tropical indian ocean and some parts of the tropical pacific ocean the mechanisms behind precipitation system scale changes can be very complicated chang et al 2016 conducted experiments with climate models and found that there existed a difference between the increase in the intensity of individual precipitation events 6 7 k and that in the total global precipitation 1 2 k thus causing changes in other aspects of precipitation events to compensate for this difference these compensating mechanisms could either affect the redistribution of additional water vapor within precipitation systems or affect the dynamical system organization which are all likely to alter the precipitation system scale in this study we investigate the potential contributing factors and find that an increase in atmospheric stability that may suppress local convective precipitation which can be considered a dynamic factor combined with an increase in the total column water vapor that may help to maintain and enhance precipitation system scale which can be considered a thermodynamic factor could jointly lead to a quasi global increase in precipitation system scale however our analysis is only conducted from a general perspective but the detailed mechanisms should still be further examined because the identification of detailed mechanisms is subject to specific characteristic changes in precipitation systems chang et al 2016 although the quasi global precipitation system scale generally exhibits an increasing trend there are also obvious regional differences which could mainly be attributed to the diverse weather systems over the different regions for example the precipitation system scale over tropical oceans affected by tropical cyclones significantly increased while that over subtropical oceans largely affected by extratropical cyclones exhibited a decreasing trend catto et al 2012 catto et al 2015 jiang and zipser 2010 knight and davis 2009 papritz et al 2014 therefore our results on the changes in the precipitation system scale may also indicate changes in the spatial extent of these weather systems another weather system that may notably impact the precipitation system scale is the mcs which commonly occurs over land regions such as south america africa south asia and maritime continent schumacher and rasmussen 2020 previous studies have found an increase in the spatial extent of mcss feng et al 2016 prein et al 2017a which is consistent with the significant increasing trends of the precipitation system scale over these land regions revealed in our study apart from these weather systems there are many other factors that may influence changes in the precipitation system scale certain large scale climate modes could play an important part in producing the environmental conditions generating various weather systems tan et al 2021 which could further affect precipitation system scale changes for example gu et al 2016 found that the pacific decadal oscillation pdo has been one of the major factors influencing long term precipitation changes in the satellite era we have also examined the effect of the el niño southern oscillation enso by calculating the correlation coefficient between the annual oceanic niño index oni value and the annual precipitation system scale the results show that the oni has a strong positive correlation with quasi global precipitation system scale r 0 52 p 0 02 therefore whether these large scale climate modes affect long term precipitation system scale changes is also worthy to be investigated in the future moreover a previous study found that the increase in urbanization could affect the local atmospheric circulation and convective motions ma and zhang 2015 which could further impact the local precipitation system scale another study found that the increasing pattern of anthropogenic aerosols conformed with the observed large scale precipitation enhancement over east china yu et al 2016 therefore anthropogenic activities may also influence precipitation system scale changes and the detailed physical processes are complex 5 conclusions under the background of global climate change precipitation changes have been widely studied however as a key property of precipitation the precipitation system scale which is of great importance in hydrometeorological studies has rarely been studied in terms of its changes and trends in recent decades recently the release of the latest merged satellite precipitation product imerg has provided new insights into research in terms of the long term precipitation changes over the last two decades against this background this study investigates changes in the quasi global precipitation system scale during the period of 2001 2020 and the major conclusions are as follows 1 generally the quasi global precipitation system scale exhibits a significant increasing trend the increasing trends are more significant in winter and spring than those in summer and autumn over both hemispheres in terms of regional differences the system scale of nearly all precipitation systems over land regions has increased over the last two decades and the most significant increasing trends occur over south asia and the maritime continent regarding ocean regions the precipitation system scale over tropical oceans also shows increasing trends especially over the indian ocean western pacific ocean near the maritime continent and eastern pacific ocean near central america in contrast precipitation systems over subtropical oceans exhibit negative precipitation system scale trends such as the northern pacific ocean as well as northern and southern high latitude atlantic ocean where the median precipitation system scale is approximately the largest worldwide 2 system based analysis shows that medium scale precipitation systems 100 1000 km significantly increase in scale and decrease in frequency while large scale precipitation systems significantly increase in frequency meanwhile super large precipitation systems 2000 km also occur more frequently during the period of 2011 2020 than that of 2001 2010 these two changes could both cause a quasi global increase in the precipitation system scale 3 to investigate the potential contributing factors which may affect the observed changes in the precipitation system scale we examine changes in atmospheric stability as a dynamical factor and the total column water vapor as a thermodynamic factor the results show that there is an increasing trend in atmospheric stability that may likely suppress convective motion and hence less local convective precipitation may occur the total column water vapor has also significantly increased over the last two decades which could help to maintain or even enhance precipitation system scale therefore both dynamic and thermodynamic changes could result in an increasing trend of the quasi global precipitation system scale moreover our results demonstrate that dynamic influences are more obvious over land regions while thermodynamic influences are more obvious over oceanic regions for the first time our study uses the latest retrospective merged satellite precipitation product to investigate the changes of precipitation system scale in a quasi global domain the quasi global increasing trend of precipitation systems may provide a new perspective in global climate change studies especially in terms of the response to the increasing temperature under the background of global warming moreover although the global total precipitation amount or frequency did not vary much over the last decades our results indicate that the inherent composition has significantly changed such as more frequent large scale precipitation systems and less frequent medium scale precipitation systems however the mechanism underlying precipitation system scale changes is relatively complicated and our study only provides an analysis from a general perspective more studies on the detailed physical processes behind precipitation system scale changes are still needed in the future credit authorship contribution statement yan zhang conceptualization methodology formal analysis investigation

research hou et al 2014 kidd and huffman 2011 trenberth et al 2003 meanwhile precipitation is a climatic variable that varies from year to year and over decades trenberth 2011 currently with the increasing attention to global climate change studies on precipitation changes have been of great concern among the scientific community longobardi and villani 2010 vincent et al 2005 an enhanced understanding of precipitation changes can provide important implications not only for analysis of past climate change but also for projection of future global and regional hydrological cycles gu et al 2016 treydte et al 2006 moreover accurate knowledge of precipitation change is essential to society since precipitation plays an important role in disaster prevention and mitigation water resource management and agriculture mondal et al 2018 scientists have already obtained several basic understandings of precipitation changes in recent decades however current precipitation change studies were mostly concentrated on the precipitation amount gu et al 2016 kazemzadeh et al 2021 wang et al 2016 westra et al 2013 frequency golian et al 2019 jung et al 2011 liu et al 2005 intensity christensen and christensen 2003 prein et al 2017a yuan and houze 2010 duration brommer et al 2007 li et al 2011 and extreme events donat et al 2016 prein et al 2017b yin et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 these previous studies all depicted precipitation from fixed places i e weather stations pixels and grid boxes which neglects the co occurrence of precipitation between adjacent stations pixels and grid boxes but unlike other meteorological fields e g temperature precipitation is a discontinuous variable and presents in the form of systems with certain spatial extents improving our knowledge of precipitation systems is crucial to elucidate thermodynamic and kinetic features of precipitation analyze the different atmospheric and hydrological impacts of precipitation systems with varying scales and improve the precipitation simulation accuracy by optimizing the precipitation parameterization schemes zhang and wang 2021 moreover in regard to precipitation that could cause flood disasters the spatial extents of precipitation systems affect the sizes of the potential flooding regions konrad 2001 which is highly significant for flood risk evaluation additionally precipitation system scale could also affect various hydrological processes gao and fang 2019 nunes et al 2006 ten veldhuis et al 2018 knowing the changes of precipitation system scales could help to enhance the hydrological modeling therefore changes in the precipitation systems such as the precipitation system scale should also be studied however in the past due to the limitation of rain gauge measurements such as the spatial inhomogeneity and sparse coverage in remote regions kidd et al 2017 the rain gauge precipitation estimates are more proper for analyzing local rainfall thus changes of precipitation s spatial characteristics have been rarely studied recently with the development of precipitation observations especially the satellite based precipitation observations kidd and levizzani 2011 kucera et al 2013 yang et al 2013 scientists began to investigate changes of spatial characteristics of precipitation some studies used ground radar and found that the spatial size of precipitation events can increase with increasing temperature berg et al 2013 lochbihler et al 2017 but most of the ground based radar are regionally distributed and hard to conduct worldwide study with suitably calibrated and densely distributed datasets in terms of worldwide studies tan et al 2021 used a retrospective satellite based precipitation dataset namely precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks climate data record persiann cdr ashouri et al 2015 and reported an increase in the spatial areas of extreme precipitation events over 1983 2018 meanwhile some other studies investigated the changes of the spatial areas of mesoscale convective systems mcss or storms via model simulation experiments chang et al 2016 guinard et al 2015 matte et al 2022 prein et al 2017a rather than based on actual precipitation observation data therefore research remains needed to comprehensively quantify spatial scale changes in all precipitation systems worldwide by using a long term high resolution and spatially consistent observational precipitation dataset which is the main motivation of our study the global precipitation measurement gpm mission is considered the next generation of precipitation measurement programs hou et al 2014 with a high temporal spatial resolution improved sensors more integrated satellite constellation and quasi global coverage gpm products are expected to be the one of the most advanced satellite precipitation estimates up to now hou et al 2014 skofronick jackson et al 2017 its primary level 3 gridded product namely the integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm imerg dataset also provides many advantages in studying global precipitation systems such as an enhanced light rain detection ability at the edge of precipitation systems improved spatial consistency and advanced algorithm capturing precipitation system motion huffman et al 2019 zhang and wang 2021 in recent years the newest version of imerg products used retrospective processing and extended the coverage period to nearly 20 years started in june 2000 which could offer new insights into the climatological study of precipitation li et al 2021b tang et al 2020 for the first time this study uses the latest retrospective merged satellite precipitation data imerg to investigate worldwide precipitation system scale changes over the last two decades furthermore seasonal and regional differences are investigated finally potential contributing factors that may affect precipitation system scale changes are identified 2 data and methods 2 1 data this study employs the latest version of imerg products namely version v06b final run with a temporal resolution of 30 min and a spatial resolution of 0 1 0 1 huffman et al 2019 the processing procedures of the product are as follows first the precipitation estimates from various satellite passive microwave pmw sensors which comprise the gpm constellation are computed using the 2017 version of the goddard profiling algorithm gprof2017 then these data from multiple sources are uniformly calibrated to the gpm combined ku radar radiometer algorithm corra product next the merged pmw estimates are processed based on the climate prediction center cpc morphing kalman filter cmorph kf lagrangian time interpolation scheme and also merged with infrared ir based precipitation estimates via the precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks cloud classification system persiann ccs recalibration scheme finally the data are adjusted with the global precipitation climatology project gpcp satellite gauge product therefore due to the advanced sensors dual frequency precipitation radar dpr and gpm microwave imager gmi onboard the gpm core observatory uniform calibration of estimates retrieved from other sensors in imerg and advanced merging algorithms combining the advantages of many previous algorithms imerg is regarded as a satellite precipitation product with suitable quality asong et al 2017 li et al 2021a tang et al 2020 it should also be noted that although the retrospective imerg product encompasses the transition of the core observatory from the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm kummerow et al 1998 to the gpm mission it has been estimated that this transition did not cause a notable difference in imerg performance between the trmm era before june 2014 and gpm era after june 2014 indicating that imerg data remain suitable for hydro climatological studies li et al 2021b tang et al 2020 in this study the selected study period spans two full decades from 2001 to 2020 the selected study areas range from 60 n to 60 s which is the native spatial range of the gpm mission and for the purpose of preventing the missing data at higher latitudes due to snow and ice huffman et al 2019 moreover meteorological parameters of the temperature and total column water vapor with a resolution of 0 25 0 25 are obtained from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf re analysis version 5 product era5 hersbach et al 2020 these meteorological variables are adopted to analyze the possible contributing factors that may influence changes in the precipitation system scale 2 2 methods 2 2 1 characterization of the precipitation system scale in this study 0 1 mm h is chosen as the precipitation threshold considering that misjudgment could occur in light precipitation detection resulting from the employed morphing and calibration algorithms li et al 2021b liu and zipser 2015 tapiador et al 2020 in addition since the hourly scale is sufficient for climatological research on the precipitation system scale half hourly imerg data are accumulated into hourly data to reduce the calculation amount the precipitation system is defined as the contiguous rainy area on an hourly basis which is used in most precipitation system extraction investigations in related studies berg et al 2013 fu et al 2020 moseley et al 2016 prein et al 2017a zhang and wang 2021 zhou et al 2019 in certain studies there may occur additional steps in precipitation system characterization for particular purposes for example zhou et al 2019 included some separate precipitation cells in large systems by defining a distance threshold and time interval to track extreme precipitation events and prein et al 2017a used a high precipitation threshold mask to focus only on regions with high precipitation rates in this study since we aim to comprehensively analyze changes in the precipitation system scale based on snapshots of all precipitation systems worldwide no additional identification restrictions are added based on the above definition first we calculate the area of each precipitation system second we use the square root of the precipitation system area as the precipitation system scale rather than directly use the system area for further analysis since other meteorological variables used in this study are all one dimensional furthermore to better investigate the characteristics of quasi global precipitation system scales we employ both grid and system based methods to conduct a comprehensive analysis specifically the grid based method records the scale of all precipitation systems where each grid box is located at each hour while system based method simply records the scale of each precipitation system at each hour the most important difference between the two methods is whether assigning the precipitation system scale to each grid box within the system or analyzing the system scale as a whole it should be noted that these two methods do not contradict each other and are used for different study purposes the grid based method could help to obtain the geographic distribution and regional differences and could be more easily combined with other gridded atmospheric factors zhang and wang 2021 while the system based method is more consistent with the natural spatial characteristics of precipitation since precipitation presents in the form of systems in nature 2 2 2 detection of changes in the precipitation system scale to detect changes in the precipitation system scale first median values rather than average values of the precipitation system scale are used to represent the mean state of the precipitation system scale over specific time periods such as annual and seasonal median values this is because the magnitude difference of system scales could be relatively large therefore the median value is more appropriate as an indicator to represent the mean state of the spatial extent of precipitation systems which has been previously employed tan et al 2021 zhang and wang 2021 then we use sen s slope method to investigate the long term trends of the precipitation system scale sen 1968 in addition to statistical significance testing via the nonparametric mann kendall trend test method mann 1945 generally sen s slope method combined with the mann kendall trend test method is widely used to estimate monotonic trends of time series data especially in many climatological studies basso et al 2021 mao et al 2022 wang et al 2020 westra et al 2013 2 2 3 characterization of the atmospheric stability in this study we also aim to determine the possible contributing factors that may affect precipitation system scale changes one of the meteorological factors namely the atmospheric stability as is defined as the difference in potential temperature θ between the upper 300 hpa and lower 900 hpa levels of the troposphere based on previous studies sharmila and walsh 2018 tu et al 2021 1 as θ 300 θ 900 where θ300 and θ900 denote the potential temperature at 300 and 900 hpa respectively the potential temperature θ can be defined as 2 θ t p 0 p r c p where t denotes the temperature k p0 denotes the reference pressure which is usually chosen as 1000 hpa p denotes the atmospheric pressure r denotes the gas constant and cp denotes the specific heat capacity under a constant pressure generally an exponent r cp value of 2 7 is usually selected for air 3 results 3 1 grid based analysis 3 1 1 long term changes in the precipitation system scale based on the introduced grid based method we obtain the geographic distribution of the precipitation system scale within a quasi global domain during the last two decades fig 1 shows the spatial distribution of the annual average precipitation amount fig 1a and median precipitation system scale fig 1b during the period of 2001 2020 in general the precipitation system scales over oceanic regions are larger than those over land regions the largest system scales are observed over mid and high latitude oceans owing to the occurrence of extratropical cyclones precipitation systems over the intertropical convergence zone itcz are also large with abundant precipitation amount which could be attributed to the frequent large mcss liu and zipser 2015 zhang and wang 2021 another possible reason for the differences in precipitation system scale between the oceanic and land regions is the processing procedure of the imerg data the precipitation estimates over land regions are further adjusted by the monthly gauge analyses huffman et al 2019 while there are very few stations over oceanic regions regarding the changes in precipitation system scale we obtain the spatial distribution of the annual trend of the precipitation system scale based on the annual median precipitation system scale where each grid box is located fig 1c generally the results illustrate a dominance of increasing trends over decreasing trends in quasi global precipitation system scale changes negative trends are found to occur over specific subtropical oceans including the northern pacific ocean and northern and southern high latitude atlantic ocean where the median precipitation system scales are larger than approximately 800 km fig 1b this result may indicate the changes in the spatial extents of subtropical cyclones that often occur over these subtropical oceans catto et al 2012 catto et al 2015 papritz et al 2014 in contrast over some midlatitude and tropical oceans the changes in precipitation system scale exhibit positive trends especially over the indian ocean western pacific ocean near the maritime continent and eastern pacific ocean near central america the results seem to be quite different from those revealed in previous studies that investigated precipitation amount and frequency changes gu et al 2016 kazemzadeh et al 2021 ren et al 2013 indicating that different precipitation properties could have different variation trends in the last decades fig 2 a1 and b1 illustrate time series of median annual precipitation system scales over the northern and southern hemispheres during the period of 2001 2020 generally the precipitation system scale exhibits increasing trends over the two hemispheres specifically the northern hemisphere is characterized by an increasing trend of 15 32 km per decade which is also statistically significant as determined with the mann kendall trend test method in contrast the increasing trend is larger over the southern hemisphere at 19 65 km per decade but is not statistically significant tested by the mann kendall trend test method the hemispheric difference could be explained by the land ocean contrast since the northern hemisphere is covered by more lands and the increasing trends in precipitation system scales are more significant over land regions to investigate precipitation system scale changes in different seasons four seasons are defined as december february djf march may mam june august jja and september november son figs 2a2 5 and b2 5 illustrate time series of median precipitation system scales at the seasonal scale over the northern and southern hemispheres during the period of 2001 2020 the results indicate that the precipitation system scale exhibits increasing trends during all seasons over both hemispheres in terms of seasonal variations the precipitation system scales over both hemispheres are characterized by more significant increasing trends during winter and spring than those during summer and autumn with the highest increase rate up to 22 62 km per decade in djf over the northern hemisphere and up to 41 27 km per decade in son over the southern hemisphere 3 1 2 regional differences in changes in the precipitation system scale to further investigate the regional differences in precipitation system scale changes first we calculate regional median values of precipitation system scale at the annual time scale in nine continental regions during the period of 2001 2020 fig 3 here the continental regions are divided according to the previous study trenberth and zhang 2018 specifically the regions include north asia 30 59 n 50 150 e south asia 10 30 n 60 150 e australia 40 10 s 110 155 e maritime continent 10 s 10 n 90 165 e north america 25 59 n 125 50 w central america 0 25 n 110 40 w south america 49 s 0 90 30 w europe 40 59 n 15 w 50 e and africa 35 s 35 n 20 w 40 e in general fig 3 shows that the precipitation system scale over all the nine regions has increased over the last two decades the highest increase rates occur over south asia and the maritime continent at 60 21 and 42 62 km per decade respectively which can be likely attributed to the increase in the spatial extents of mcss over these regions feng et al 2016 prein et al 2017a in contrast the changes in precipitation system scale over north america and central america are not statistically significant and the trends appear to be lowest over north america and africa moreover the seasonal variation in the trends of the precipitation system scale over these nine continental regions is shown in table 1 the results show that the precipitation system scales over north asia maritime continent north america south america and europe have increasing trends in all four seasons although some of the changes are not statistically significant apart from these regions precipitation system scales over south asia are characterized by largest rising rate in djf by 90 46 km per decade but decrease non significantly in mam precipitation system scales in australia only decrease in jja and increase in other three seasons while precipitation system scales in africa only decrease in djf although these decreasing trends are both not statistically significant as for central america changes of precipitation system scales over this region are not statistically significant in all seasons based on the above results revealed in fig 1c and 3 it seems that nearly all the significant changes in the precipitation system scale over land regions involve positive trends therefore we further examine the statistical significance and trend direction of the precipitation system scale changes over continental regions fig 4 at the continental scale the results reveal that 25 34 36 29 7 89 39 93 13 76 49 21 33 60 17 06 and 31 53 of the grid boxes are observed to indicate significant trends over north asia south asia australia maritime continent north america central america south america europe and africa respectively fig 4a among these grid boxes with significant trends positive trends account for more than 95 of the total grid boxes over nearly all regions except for north america fig 4b a positive trend of the precipitation system scale is found to occur most frequently over south asia 99 48 and australia 99 22 with the lowest frequency over north america 84 85 the results further indicate the dominance of significant positive trends of the precipitation system scale over most continental regions which may provide meaningful impacts for hydrologic systems and populations there such as the impact on the potential areas of flood regions 3 2 system based analysis to investigate precipitation system scale changes in detail we choose to perform further system based analysis first we categorize the quasi global precipitation systems into 100 km 100 1000 km and 1000 km systems according to the scale then we calculate the annual frequency and median system scale of the precipitation systems with different scales during the period of 2001 2020 as shown in fig 5a and 5b respectively here the frequency is defined as the number of precipitation systems in all hours fig 5a and 5b show that the frequency of small scale precipitation systems 100 km increased and the median scale slightly decreased in contrast 100 1000 km precipitation systems exhibit a significant decreasing trend of the frequency and an increasing trend of the median scale among precipitation systems with 1000 km scales the trend in the frequency is positive and that in the median scale is not statistically significant the results indicate medium scale precipitation systems 100 1000 km significantly increase in scale and decrease in frequency while large scale precipitation systems significantly increase in frequency which both lead to a quasi global increase in the precipitation system scale then we divide the last two decades into 2001 2010 and 2011 2020 and compare the frequency distribution of the precipitation system scale between these two decades as shown in fig 6 the results show that the most obvious difference in frequency distribution between the two decades is observed at the frequency of the precipitation systems with scales larger than 2000 km these super large precipitation systems occur more frequently during the period of 2011 2020 than the previous decade of 2001 2010 which may be another reason why the quasi global precipitation system scale has increased over the past two decades 3 3 potential contributing factors it is also important to determine why the quasi global precipitation system scale has increased over the past two decades since precipitation changes are mainly attributed to thermodynamic and dynamical changes chang et al 2016 chou et al 2009 held and soden 2006 seager et al 2010 we examine two related meteorological variables namely the total column water vapor integrated from the surface to the top of the atmosphere and the atmospheric stability between the upper 300 hpa and lower 900 hpa levels of the troposphere during the period of 2001 2020 fig 7 shows the time series of the atmospheric stability and total column water vapor as well as their relationships with the precipitation system scale here the spearman s rank correlation coefficient is used to calculate the relationships of the precipitation system scale with the potential contributing factors from the perspective of dynamic changes fig 7a shows a significant increasing trend in atmospheric stability which is consistent with the results reported in previous studies sharmila and walsh 2018 tu et al 2021 furthermore the correlation coefficient between the time series of the atmospheric stability and precipitation system scale is 0 82 which is significant at the 0 05 significance level the results indicate that one possible mechanism behind the increase in quasi global precipitation system scale could be that the increase in atmospheric stability may tend to suppress convective motion and hence less local convective precipitation may occur moreover fig 7b illustrates that there also exists a significant rising trend in the total column water vapor which has been widely studied under the background of global warming as warmer air attains a higher water holding capacity according to the clausius clapeyron cc equation chou et al 2013 wentz et al 2007 the correlation coefficient between the time series of total column water vapor and precipitation system scale reaches 0 78 which is significant at the 0 05 significance level the results indicate that from the perspective of thermodynamic changes more water vapor content in the atmosphere triggered by the increasing temperature could help to maintain or even enhance precipitation system scale which could subsequently lead to the increase in the quasi global precipitation system scale the annual time series of the atmospheric stability and total column water vapor over each hemisphere as well as land only and ocean only domains are shown in figs 8 and 9 respectively in addition their correlation coefficients with the precipitation system scale are summarized in table 2 the results demonstrate that both the atmospheric stability and total column water vapor over each hemisphere exhibit increasing trends fig 8 and both these quantities are all positively correlated with the precipitation system scale table 2 similar phenomena are found over land and ocean only domains fig 9 it is worth noting that the correlation of the precipitation system scale with the atmospheric stability is stronger over the land only domain with a correlation coefficient of 0 78 while the correlation with the total column water vapor is stronger over the ocean only domain with a correlation coefficient of 0 73 this could probably be explained by the fact that the dynamic effects on local convective precipitation suppression are more obvious over land regions while the thermodynamic changes that maintain and enhance precipitation system scale are more evident over oceanic regions 4 discussion with the increasing attention to global climate change precipitation changes have been widely studied since precipitation is closely related to the temperature as expressed in the cc equation one of the most obvious phenomena drawing considerable attention is that global warming is causing more extreme precipitation donat et al 2016 prein et al 2017b yin et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 recently studies have found that in addition to the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation events the spatial extent of extreme precipitation has also increased in recent decades matte et al 2022 tan et al 2021 wasko et al 2016 against this background the results obtained in our study provide additional insights illustrating that not only the extreme precipitation events but also the quasi global precipitation systems have increased significantly in spatial scales other than the observed increase in extreme precipitation events there exist other typical viewpoints on global precipitation changes researchers have proposed that dry areas become drier and wet regions become wetter which is often described as dry gets drier and wet gets wetter held and soden 2006 huang et al 2013 other scientists support the view that in the tropics rainfall increases where the sea surface temperature sst increases beyond the average sst value which is often described as warmer gets wetter chadwick et al 2013 xie et al 2010 similar conclusions are found in our study whereby large scale precipitation systems have become more frequent and larger which can be described as large gets larger which is particularly observed over tropical regions such as the tropical indian ocean and some parts of the tropical pacific ocean the mechanisms behind precipitation system scale changes can be very complicated chang et al 2016 conducted experiments with climate models and found that there existed a difference between the increase in the intensity of individual precipitation events 6 7 k and that in the total global precipitation 1 2 k thus causing changes in other aspects of precipitation events to compensate for this difference these compensating mechanisms could either affect the redistribution of additional water vapor within precipitation systems or affect the dynamical system organization which are all likely to alter the precipitation system scale in this study we investigate the potential contributing factors and find that an increase in atmospheric stability that may suppress local convective precipitation which can be considered a dynamic factor combined with an increase in the total column water vapor that may help to maintain and enhance precipitation system scale which can be considered a thermodynamic factor could jointly lead to a quasi global increase in precipitation system scale however our analysis is only conducted from a general perspective but the detailed mechanisms should still be further examined because the identification of detailed mechanisms is subject to specific characteristic changes in precipitation systems chang et al 2016 although the quasi global precipitation system scale generally exhibits an increasing trend there are also obvious regional differences which could mainly be attributed to the diverse weather systems over the different regions for example the precipitation system scale over tropical oceans affected by tropical cyclones significantly increased while that over subtropical oceans largely affected by extratropical cyclones exhibited a decreasing trend catto et al 2012 catto et al 2015 jiang and zipser 2010 knight and davis 2009 papritz et al 2014 therefore our results on the changes in the precipitation system scale may also indicate changes in the spatial extent of these weather systems another weather system that may notably impact the precipitation system scale is the mcs which commonly occurs over land regions such as south america africa south asia and maritime continent schumacher and rasmussen 2020 previous studies have found an increase in the spatial extent of mcss feng et al 2016 prein et al 2017a which is consistent with the significant increasing trends of the precipitation system scale over these land regions revealed in our study apart from these weather systems there are many other factors that may influence changes in the precipitation system scale certain large scale climate modes could play an important part in producing the environmental conditions generating various weather systems tan et al 2021 which could further affect precipitation system scale changes for example gu et al 2016 found that the pacific decadal oscillation pdo has been one of the major factors influencing long term precipitation changes in the satellite era we have also examined the effect of the el niño southern oscillation enso by calculating the correlation coefficient between the annual oceanic niño index oni value and the annual precipitation system scale the results show that the oni has a strong positive correlation with quasi global precipitation system scale r 0 52 p 0 02 therefore whether these large scale climate modes affect long term precipitation system scale changes is also worthy to be investigated in the future moreover a previous study found that the increase in urbanization could affect the local atmospheric circulation and convective motions ma and zhang 2015 which could further impact the local precipitation system scale another study found that the increasing pattern of anthropogenic aerosols conformed with the observed large scale precipitation enhancement over east china yu et al 2016 therefore anthropogenic activities may also influence precipitation system scale changes and the detailed physical processes are complex 5 conclusions under the background of global climate change precipitation changes have been widely studied however as a key property of precipitation the precipitation system scale which is of great importance in hydrometeorological studies has rarely been studied in terms of its changes and trends in recent decades recently the release of the latest merged satellite precipitation product imerg has provided new insights into research in terms of the long term precipitation changes over the last two decades against this background this study investigates changes in the quasi global precipitation system scale during the period of 2001 2020 and the major conclusions are as follows 1 generally the quasi global precipitation system scale exhibits a significant increasing trend the increasing trends are more significant in winter and spring than those in summer and autumn over both hemispheres in terms of regional differences the system scale of nearly all precipitation systems over land regions has increased over the last two decades and the most significant increasing trends occur over south asia and the maritime continent regarding ocean regions the precipitation system scale over tropical oceans also shows increasing trends especially over the indian ocean western pacific ocean near the maritime continent and eastern pacific ocean near central america in contrast precipitation systems over subtropical oceans exhibit negative precipitation system scale trends such as the northern pacific ocean as well as northern and southern high latitude atlantic ocean where the median precipitation system scale is approximately the largest worldwide 2 system based analysis shows that medium scale precipitation systems 100 1000 km significantly increase in scale and decrease in frequency while large scale precipitation systems significantly increase in frequency meanwhile super large precipitation systems 2000 km also occur more frequently during the period of 2011 2020 than that of 2001 2010 these two changes could both cause a quasi global increase in the precipitation system scale 3 to investigate the potential contributing factors which may affect the observed changes in the precipitation system scale we examine changes in atmospheric stability as a dynamical factor and the total column water vapor as a thermodynamic factor the results show that there is an increasing trend in atmospheric stability that may likely suppress convective motion and hence less local convective precipitation may occur the total column water vapor has also significantly increased over the last two decades which could help to maintain or even enhance precipitation system scale therefore both dynamic and thermodynamic changes could result in an increasing trend of the quasi global precipitation system scale moreover our results demonstrate that dynamic influences are more obvious over land regions while thermodynamic influences are more obvious over oceanic regions for the first time our study uses the latest retrospective merged satellite precipitation product to investigate the changes of precipitation system scale in a quasi global domain the quasi global increasing trend of precipitation systems may provide a new perspective in global climate change studies especially in terms of the response to the increasing temperature under the background of global warming moreover although the global total precipitation amount or frequency did not vary much over the last decades our results indicate that the inherent composition has significantly changed such as more frequent large scale precipitation systems and less frequent medium scale precipitation systems however the mechanism underlying precipitation system scale changes is relatively complicated and our study only provides an analysis from a general perspective more studies on the detailed physical processes behind precipitation system scale changes are still needed in the future credit authorship contribution statement yan zhang conceptualization methodology formal analysis investigation

2576,evaporation from the surface of water is a vital component of the hydrological cycle accurately simulating evaporation is crucial for modeling hydrological processes ensuring ecosystem water efficiency and managing water resources previous methods for evaluating evaporation have generally been limited to a single site and on a regional scale based on eddy covariance measurements of 14 boreal flux sites the accuracy of 26 methods for simulating daily water surface evaporation was comprehensively evaluated in this study most methods accurately simulated daily evaporation at most sites with a kge 0 60 the combination methods with simultaneous calibration of the energy and aerodynamic terms and the double parameter aerodynamic methods based on the linear and exponential functions showed the best performance with the median kge of the evaluated sites ranging from 0 72 to 0 76 the bowen ratio energy balance breb method embedded with tw rs based two variable empirical methods double parameter aerodynamic methods and the combination method of the energy term based on net radiation rn and the aerodynamic term based on the exponential function method performed better than the other methods of the same type the relative error re simulated by most methods was generally within 30 with the median re of all sites within 10 for each method the combination methods tended to overestimate the level of evaporation whereas the breb type and aerodynamic methods tended to underestimate the extent of evaporation the simulation accuracy of the daily evaporation showed significant variance among the sites it showed the best model performance at two fluxnet and two sites taken from the literature in which 75 of the methods were able to accurately simulate daily evaporation with a kling gupta efficiency kge 0 80 all methods performed poorly at the three sites from the literature and were mainly due to the lack of measured variables with a strong correlation with the latent heat flux le the fluxnet sites generally showed better performance the observed le of the sites with the best model performance generally showed a unimodal distribution throughout the year the simulation accuracy of non unimodal distribution sites mainly depended on the correlation between the le and related variables the combination of the energy term based on rn and the aerodynamic term based on the power function method showed the best model stability this finding indicated that the calibrated method was robust and showed high stability in simulating daily evaporation and it was recommended for application in other sites or regions the optimization of parameters calibrated in this study may improve the accuracy of simulating the daily evaporation for

component of the hydrological cycle condon et al 2020 zhao and gao 2019 worldwide up to 50 of reservoirs capacity and approximately 20 of the water inflow in global lakes are lost due to evaporation zhao and gao 2019 abdallah et al 2021 evaporation losses from reservoirs are greater than the industrial and domestic water consumption zhao and gao 2019 accurate simulation of evaporation is crucial for modeling hydrological processes optimizing ecosystem water efficiency and managing water resources ponce campos et al 2013 wang et al 2018 jansen and teuling 2020 various methods have been used to simulate evaporation from water bodies they can be subdivided into six major types friedrich et al 2018 jansen and teuling 2020 fournier et al 2021 zolá et al 2019 namely the pan coefficient method water balance method energy budget approaches empirical relations with related variables aerodynamic methods also called mass transfer or bulk transfer and combination methods e g the penman equation combining the energy and aerodynamic components the evaporation pan is an intuitive observation technique pan evaporation observations with a coefficient have also been used to evaluate other simulation methods singh and xu 1997 xu and singh 2000 losgedaragh and rahimzadegan 2018 however the relationship between evaporation and meteorological parameters differs in pan and open water bodies rodrigues et al 2020 the pan coefficient varies on both spatial and temporal scales yu et al 2017 anda et al 2018 rodrigues et al 2021 in the absence of measured data water balance or energy budget methods are generally used to evaluate other methods of simulating evaporation from the water surface for example the monthly water balance method was used to evaluate the accuracy of the three aerodynamic methods in a medium sized lake shilo et al 2015 this method is mainly limited to lakes in which hydrological process variables are observed in addition they are limited to long timescales liu et al 2019a the monthly energy budget method has also been used to evaluate the evaporation pan coefficient and aerodynamic parameters sacks et al 1994 winter et al 1995 more studies have used estimates of the bowen ratio energy balance breb method as a reference to evaluate other methods dos reis and dias 1998 delclaux et al 2007 rosenberry et al 2007 majidi et al 2015 this method requires temperature observations of different water layers which are unavailable for most water bodies evaluations in shallow lake and dryland reservoirs using the evaporation pan coefficient method showed that the combination and energy budget approaches were the most precise evaporation models while the air temperature based methods had the lowest accuracy anda et al 2018 rodrigues et al 2021 conversely the performance of air temperature based methods was better than that of the combination method when the breb method was applied for evaluations at a reservoir in a semi arid region majidi et al 2015 the monthly and annual evaporation values simulated by some aerodynamic and radiation based methods agreed closely with the pan values singh and xu 1997 xu and singh 2000 excellent model performance of aerodynamic methods has been achieved using over water or local over land meteorological observations when evaluated by pan observations at a pit lake mcjannet et al 2017 however the model performance was reduced when off site data were used in general combination methods which require more input data showed the best performance when referenced by breb measurements winter et al 1995 rosenberry et al 2007 delclaux et al 2007 evaluations of empirical relations showed that simulations of relative humidity and solar radiation were in close agreement with the pan values at a small reservoir althoff et al 2019 equations that used air temperature combined with sunshine or dew point temperature as input variables performed better majidi et al 2015 rodrigues et al 2021 the eddy covariance ec technique which is the standard method used to measure evaporation is generally considered to be the most accurate measurement method tanny et al 2008 friedrich et al 2018 rodrigues et al 2020 ec measurements have been used as a reference to evaluate other evaporation simulation methods for several lakes and reservoirs tanny et al 2008 tanny et al 2011 evaluated five combination and aerodynamic methods based on ec observations of a reservoir in israel and found that the penman brutsaert and penman monteith unsworth models performed best in simulating the mean values the penman model agreed best with ec measurements in predicting the daily series with a nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient of only 0 30 andreasen et al 2017 evaluated the energy budget empirical relations and aerodynamic methods in a small lake in the usa and found that regression relations combined with energy and aerodynamic variables provided the best daily data compared with ec measurements the energy budget method was poor for simulating daily lake evaporation owing to large errors in lake heat storage metzger et al 2018 evaluated the breb priestley taylor pt penman and aerodynamic methods using ec observations of the dead sea the aerodynamic and penman equations with changes in water heat storage showed the best performance in simulating the daily series with a correlation coefficient r 0 90 the r values of the energy budget approaches breb and pt without changing the water heat storage were reduced to 0 70 fournier et al 2021 evaluated pt penman and empirical and aerodynamic methods using ec measurements at two canadian reservoirs the aerodynamic methods with calibrated parameters showed the best performance with the r values of the two reservoirs being 0 70 and 0 90 respectively the pt and penman equations showed poor performance r 0 20 in general previous research has largely evaluated evaporation methods on a regional scale and has been limited to a single site however there is a relative lack of comparative assessments from multiple sites at present there are an increasing number of ec observation sites this provides a good opportunity to assess evaporation methods at multi site scales ec measurements were used to comprehensively evaluate the ability of various evaporation methods to accurately simulate daily evaporation at the boreal flux sites this study addresses four key objectives 1 evaluating the accuracy of 26 evaporation methods in simulating daily water surface evaporation at 14 boreal flux sites 2 investigating the variation in the performance of evaporation methods at each site 3 calibrating the optimal parameter values for each method at each site and testing the stability of the simulation accuracy of these methods and 4 investigating the spatial and temporal distribution of simulation accuracy at boreal flux sites 2 materials and methods 2 1 observation data boreal ec observations of water bodies were used in this study fig 1 these include the fluxnet ch4 community product knox et al 2019 and data from literature bouin et al 2012 cui et al 2021 feng et al 2016 goldbach and kuttler 2015 guo et al 2016 han et al 2020 li et al 2016 liu et al 2011 xiao et al 2018 there were four fluxnet ch4 sites covering lakes and wetlands and 10 sites taken from the literature covering lakes and reservoirs the longest observational record was 25 years whereas the shortest was less than one year the daily data series of ec measured latent heat flux le were used as references for evaluation while the observed incoming short wave radiation rs net radiation rn sensible heat flux h mean air temperature ta wind speed u atmospheric pressure p relative humidity rh vapor pressure deficit vpd and water surface temperature tw were used in the simulation of water surface evaporation all missing values were eliminated for example if there were missing values on a certain day all data on that day were discarded therefore only days with fully available half hourly data were used in the analysis it applied mean and standard deviation approaches to detect outliers liu et al 2019b several variables were missing measurements at some literature sites table s1 2 2 methods of evaporation calculations the evaporation calculation methods used in this study are presented in table 1 it includes 26 methods and can be divided into four types breb empirical relations aerodynamic models and combination methods the breb sene 1991 one of energy budget approaches is described as follows 1 l e b r e b r n δ s 1 β l e b r e b f r n 1 β β h l e c p t w t a λ e s e a where δs is the change in heat storage in the water bodies cp is the specific heat capacity of the air β is the bowen ratio and λ is the latent heat of vaporization here es and ea represent the saturation vapor pressure at the water surface and in the atmosphere respectively because of the lack of profile temperature of the water body δs cannot be calculated referring to the study of duan and bastiaanssen 2017 this study assumed that there is a linear empirical relationship between rn and δs and used lebreb to simulate daily series of water surface evaporation in addition ficke 1972 and winter et al 2003 improved the breb method using water surface temperature this method is often used as a standard reference to evaluate other evaporation methods rosenberry et al 2007 giadrossich et al 2015 majidi et al 2015 the empirical relation method with single variable generally uses radiation variables rn or rs to simulate le this type of method is also called radiation based method singh and xu 2000 it can be expressed as follows 2 l e f x a x b where is rs or rn and a and b are parameters to be calibrated based on double parameter and single parameter six radiation based methods table 1 are evaluated the e rn 3 method is the pt method priestley and taylor 1972 according to the optimal variables evaluated by majidi et al 2015 and althoff et al 2019 four methods composed of ta and rh and radiation factors were selected table 1 the method combined by ta and rs e ta rs was proposed by jensen and haise 1963 aerodynamic models are generally represented as follows 3 l e f u e s e a where u is the mean wind speed es ea is the vpd and f is the wind speed function in addition to the most commonly used linear functions this study also evaluated four exponential and four power functions table 1 the penman equation is a classical combination method it includes the energy and aerodynamic terms of water surface evaporation the equation is expressed as follows 4 l e δ δ γ r n δ s γ δ γ f u e s e a where δ represents the slope of the saturation vapor pressure temperature relationship and γ is the psychrometric constant these variables were calculated according to allen et al 1998 δs was neglected because of data limitations in this study penman 1948 calibrated the wind speed function using observed data which have been widely applied in evaporation and evapotranspiration calculations in this study the optimal parameters of the wind speed function were calibrated using ec measurements of the water surface evaporation in addition four other combination methods table 1 which calibrate parameters of energy and aerodynamic terms at the same time were also evaluated 2 3 evaluation criteria the performance of these methods was evaluated using flux observation data the evaluation criteria included relative error re root mean square error rmse and kling gupta efficiency kge re and rmse represent bias deviation from the observed values while kge is indicative of the goodness of fit of the simulated and observed data series the best fit value was 1 0 while the goodness of fit deteriorated with increasing deviation from 1 0 the evaluation criteria were calculated as follows 5 r e 1 n i 1 n x m i x o i x o i 6 r m s e 1 n i 1 n x m i x m x o i x o 2 7 k g e 1 1 r 2 r e 2 1 s d m s d o 2 8 s d 1 n 1 i 1 n x i x 2 9 r i 1 n x o i x o x m i x m i 1 n x o i x o 2 i 1 n x m i x m 2 where x m i and x o i are the ith values of the modeled and observed et time series respectively n is the time series length x m and x o are the means of the modeled and observed et respectively and s d m and s d o are the standard deviations of the modeled and observed et respectively the parameters in each equation were calibrated according to daily data at each flux site the daily series of each site was randomly assigned to one of two datasets 80 to the calibration dataset and 20 to the validation dataset the random assignment process is repeated to generate 100 independent datasets the parameters of these methods were calibrated using the kge at each observation site 3 results 3 1 correlation between daily le and its related variables the correlation between the 10 variables and the daily series of le is shown in fig 2 in general vpd showed the strongest correlation with daily le with the median and mean values of r for all sites exceeding or close to 0 60 the r was 0 50 at most sites 10 13 the highest r value was found at the fr thl site 0 95 however the correlation between the vpd and le of the tibetan plateau lake sites cn qin cn yay and cn ngo in china is relatively weak especially at the cn ngo site r 0 05 radiation rs and rn and temperature ta and tw variables also showed strong positive correlations with daily le with the median r of all sites exceeding 0 50 rh was negatively correlated with daily le and the median r of all sites was close to 0 50 u and p were positively and negatively correlated respectively with daily le the median r was 0 26 and 0 28 respectively the correlation between water temperature change δtw and daily le was the weakest the correlation between daily le and related variables varied significantly at different sites for example vpd and temperature ta and tw were strongly correlated with le at the fr thl site r 0 90 while u and δtw were very weakly related to le r 0 1 the r between the le and its related variables at the plateau lake sites in china was within 0 50 3 2 evaluation of simulation accuracy among different methods for the methods containing the γ as shown in table 1 the simulation accuracy of γ calculated using the site altitude was compared with that simulated using a daily series of atmospheric pressure data the results showed little difference between the two groups table 2 therefore γ was calculated using site altitude in the following evaluations the accuracy of the 26 methods of simulation of water surface evaporation evaluated by the kge is shown in fig 3 to make full use of the observed data the same type of methods were first evaluated in fig 3a f among the breb type methods the breb t method embedded with tw performed better than the original breb method fig 3a the median kge at all sites increased from 0 07 to 0 33 three of the 12 sites had a kge 0 75 and the us twt site had the highest kge of 0 91 in the empirical relation methods the median kge of all evaluated sites was approximately 0 65 in each method except for the e rn 3 method fig 3b there was little difference between the rs based and rn based methods when the double parameter was calibrated the performance of the single parameter calibration was slightly worse than that of the double parameter calibration particularly for the e rn 3 method among the two variable empirical methods with ta the rs based method performed slightly better than the rn based method the median kge of all sites in the e ta rs and e ta rn methods were 0 67 and 0 62 respectively fig 3b and the median kge of all sites was 0 76 and 0 71 respectively fig 3c conversely rh combined with rn performed better than rh combined with rs the median kge of the e rh rs and e rh rn methods were 0 63 and 0 69 respectively the radiation variable combined with ta was slightly better than that combined with rh fig 3c however the rmse evaluation results showed that the performance of the rs based empirical method was significantly better than that of the rn based method fig s1 the number of evaluation sites for the aerodynamic methods was 12 which was the same as that for the breb type methods compared to the breb methods the simulation accuracy of the aerodynamic methods was significantly improved for example the median kge of the linear function method a lf increased to 0 71 the simulation accuracies of the power functions a pf 1 and a pf 2 and exponential functions a ef 1 and a ef 2 with double parameters were almost the same as that of the linear function the single parameter power function a pf 3 and exponential function a ef 3 methods perform relatively poorly with the corresponding median kge of 0 36 and 0 29 respectively the kge of the fr thl site was close to 0 90 whereas that of the other 11 sites was 0 5 another form of single parameter power and exponential function method a pf 4 and a ef 4 was also calibrated the optimal values of the power and exponential function were 0 5 and 0 2 see table 1 where the range of calibration values were 0 1 1 9 and 0 05 0 95 respectively compared with the a pf 3 and a ef 3 methods the median kge values of the a pf 4 and a ef 4 methods were increased to 0 70 and 0 65 respectively these two methods particularly the former showed simulation accuracies similar to those of the double parameter aerodynamic methods the simulation accuracy of the c p method after parameter optimization was improved compared to the penman equation with the original parameters table 2 and fig 3e four of the ten evaluated sites had a kge of 0 7 the simultaneous calibration of energy and aerodynamic terms in the combination method could obviously improve the simulation accuracy fig 3e especially the combination method of the energy term based on rn and the aerodynamic term based on the exponent function c ern3 aef4 the median kge of the 10 sites improved from 0 56 to 0 71 when the energy and aerodynamic terms were simultaneously calibrated the simulation accuracy showed little difference between the rn based and rs based methods or between the power function and exponential function fig 3f the simulation accuracies of the 26 methods according to the six sites used in all the methods are compared in fig 3g overall the combination methods with simultaneous calibration of the energy and aerodynamic terms c ern3 aef4 c ern3 apf4 c ers3 aef4 and c ers3 apf4 and the aerodynamic methods based on the linear and exponential functions a lf a pf 1 and a pf 2 showed the best performance the mean kge of the evaluated sites in each method ranged from 0 62 to 0 64 and the corresponding median ranged from 0 72 to 0 76 the kge of each method was 0 70 in all four fluxnet sites the e rs 1 e ta rs a pf 4 a ef 1 and a ef 2 methods also accurately estimated daily water surface evaporation at most sites with a mean kge of 0 60 or 0 61 the median kge of all sites was 0 76 particularly for the first two empirical methods the e rs 2 e rs 3 e rn 1 e rn 2 e ta rn and a ef 4 methods performed slightly worse than the previous methods the mean value of kge ranged from 0 57 to 0 59 and the median kge was generally higher than 0 71 the e rn 3 c p e rh rs and e rh rn methods performed worse than the previous methods but also with a kge above 0 60 at most sites the breb type and single parameter aerodynamic methods a pf 3 and a ef 3 performed relatively poorly with only a few sites with kge 0 60 the accuracy of the 26 methods evaluated by re fig 4 was generally consistent with that evaluated by kge the breb t r based two variable empirical methods the double parameter aerodynamic methods and the c ern3 aef4 method performed better than the other methods of the same type the re simulated by most methods was generally within 30 the median re of all the sites was within 10 for each method the breb type and aerodynamic methods tended to underestimate le fig 4a and d whereas the combination methods tended to overestimate le fig 4e and f fig 5 shows the performance of the c ern3 apf4 method on the calibration and validation datasets evaluated by re and kge respectively the median and mean values of re and kge simulated by 100 randomly sampled data series showed little difference between the calibration and validation periods at each site the results of the random sampling calibration and validation of other methods with better performance were similar to those of the c ern3 apf4 method not shown this indicates that the proposed methods are robust there was little difference between the calibration and validation periods at the sites with high simulation accuracy whereas there were large differences in the sites with relatively poor simulation accuracy random sampling had a greater impact on simulation accuracy at sites with relatively poor model performance for example the re of 100 samples of the cn qin site during the calibration period varied between 35 and 50 the variation expanded to 16 90 during the validation period random sampling had little impact on simulation accuracy at the fr thl us sne and us twt sites which had the best model performance the kge of 100 samples in the calibration period varied between 0 92 and 0 94 0 88 0 90 and 0 79 0 81 respectively the variation slightly increased in the validation but was also relatively stable between 0 89 and 0 95 0 85 0 92 and 0 77 0 84 respectively overall the evaporation method exhibited high stability robustness at sites with high simulation accuracy but relatively weak stability at sites with poor simulation accuracy 3 3 evaluation of simulation accuracy based on the same set of parameters from all sites the evaluation of the simulation accuracy when the parameters were calibrated at each site is shown in the previous section in this section the accuracy of the simulation based on the same set of parameters from all sites is evaluated for each evaporation method for sites with kge 0 5 the accuracy of each method using unified parameters from selected sites was also compared with those using calibrated parameters at each site fig 6 the number of sites selected for each method ranged from five to nine the simulation accuracy of each method using unified parameters was generally lower than that using calibrated parameters at each site the median kge of all sites for most methods 23 26 was between 0 71 and 0 80 when parameters were calibrated at each site if unified parameters from all or selected sites were applied the median kge for most methods 16 26 or 19 26 was generally reduced to between 0 55 and 0 59 the reduction in the simulation accuracy using unified parameters was relatively limited in some methods the c ern3 apf4 method exhibited the best model stability the median kge only decreased by 0 03 when unified parameters were used model stability was also found in the other three combination methods with simultaneous calibration of the energy and aerodynamic parameters c ers3 aef4 c ern3 aef4 and c ern3 apf4 the a ef 1 e rh rs and e ta rs methods with a decrease in the median kge of 0 09 when using unified parameters from all sites in addition the c p e rs 1 e rs 2 and e rs 3 methods were also relatively stable when using the unified parameters from the selected sites with the median kge decreasing between 0 06 and 0 08 however the simulation accuracy of some methods is significantly reduced by the unified parameters for example the median kge decreased by 0 30 in the breb t and the seven aerodynamic methods except the a pf 1 and a ef 1 methods when simulated by unified parameters from all sites if unified parameters from the selected sites were used the methods with the decrease of the median kge 0 30 were four aerodynamic methods a lf a ef 3 a ef 2 and a pf 2 the decrease of the median kge for unified parameters was generally between 0 10 and 0 29 in other methods 3 4 spatial and temporal distribution of simulation accuracy the frequency of the kge for all methods which included the maximum 75 50 and 25 frequency values was calculated at each site the spatial distribution of these statistics is shown in fig 7 most sites 11 14 found an accurate method to simulate the daily series of water surface evaporation with a maximum kge 0 5 the best model performance was observed at the fr thl site with a median kge of 0 93 for all methods the kge was 0 85 for almost all methods except for the breb type methods and empirical methods with a single variable it also showed the ability to accurately simulate daily evaporation at the us twt us sne and cn ser sites where 75 of the methods had a kge 0 80 this indicated that most of the methods were able to accurately simulate daily evaporation at these sites the optimal methods with high accuracy varied from site to site for example most methods 17 26 including the breb empirical relation and combination type methods had a kge 0 80 at the us sne site except for nine aerodynamic methods conversely the aerodynamic methods performed better than the other types of methods at the cn ser site especially the double parameter aerodynamic methods with kge 0 80 the kge simulated using the optimal method was approximately 0 75 at the de dgw jp swl and us rob sites most methods 75 accurately simulated daily evaporation at these sites with a kge 0 70 apart from the breb methods at the de dgw site where they showed poor performance kge 0 35 the other methods showed kge 0 70 at these sites the model performance was also satisfactory at the de sub cn poy cn qin and cn erh sites with the optimal kge simulated at these sites ranging from 0 50 to 0 70 in general the simulation accuracy of water surface evaporation at different sites was positively correlated with the correlation between le and its related variables fig 8 a higher simulation accuracy was generally found at sites with a stronger correlation between le and related variables for example ta and vpd which are closely related to the aerodynamic term for evaporation were strongly correlated with le r 0 90 at the fr thl site the r between the le and radiation variables associated with the evaporation energy term was also 0 80 at this site the strongest correlation between the le and related variables in the evaporation method was the main reason for the best model performance at this site this study also evaluated the simulation accuracy of the linear empirical relationship between each single related variable and the le the results showed that the accuracy was proportional to the correlation between le and the related variable therefore if there are related variables strongly correlated with le it is recommended to use the linear empirical relation to simulate evaporation for example there was a strong correlation between u and le in the cn erh site r was close to 0 80 and the simulation accuracy of the corresponding linear empirical relation kge 0 74 was much greater than that of the other optimal methods kge 0 51 all methods performed poorly at the cn ngo cn yay and us whb sites with the kge of each method being lower than 0 30 this was due to the relatively weak correlation between le and the related variables at these sites fig 8 for example in the first two tibetan plateau lake sites cn ngo and cn yay the r between the le and related variables used in evaporation methods except h was within 0 40 the impact of the temporal distribution characteristics of the le series on simulation accuracy was analyzed the data series of the observed and simulated le and its strongly correlated related variables at several representative sites are shown in fig 9 the sites with a unimodal distribution within the year showed the best model performance in simulating daily water surface evaporation particularly for sites with significant differences between the peak and trough values of the distribution for example the optimal kge of the fr thl and us sne sites was 0 96 and 0 90 respectively the le at the two sites showed a relatively sharp unimodal distribution in the annual cycle with the difference between the peak and trough values exceeding 100 w m2 fig 9a and b although the le of the jp swl site also exhibited a unimodal distribution within the observed year the kge of the optimal method was 0 75 this might have been caused by the relatively flat distribution at this site fig 9c the simulation accuracy of non unimodal distribution sites mainly depended on the correlation between the le and related variables input to the methods if there were variables strongly correlated with le the method with these variables as inputs could accurately simulate daily evaporation fig 9d and e for example the le was strongly correlated with the u and vpd at the us rob r 0 37 and 0 62 respectively and cn ser r 0 63 and 0 55 respectively sites and the kge of the a lf and a ef 2 methods with the u and vpd as inputs were 0 74 and 0 82 respectively similar results for the other seven sites could be found in fig s2 the weak correlation between the input related factors and le fig 8 is the main reason for the poor performance of the common methods used table 1 therefore for sites with general model performance the variables strongly correlated with le were selected to establish the corresponding empirical linear relation methods the simulation accuracy of the calibrated methods was significantly improved compared with the common methods with the optimal kge of the cn ngo us whb cn yay and cn erh sites increasing from 0 22 0 23 0 02 and 0 49 to 0 43 0 46 0 39 and 0 73 respectively the simulated daily le of the first two sites are shown in fig 9f and g although the empirical linear method improved the simulation accuracy the model performance was still unsatisfactory kge 0 5 because the r between the le and the strongest correlated variable was only approximately 0 40 the simulation accuracy of the us whb site was poor which might have been mainly due to large errors in simulating the extreme values of daily le this tended to underestimate the peak values and overestimate the trough values in other words the variation coefficient of the simulated series of le was significantly lower than the observed values this is because the variation coefficient of the daily series of mean air temperature which was an input to the model was much lower than that of the le this greatly overestimated le in june and july and generally underestimated le from august to october at the cn ngo site this is the main reason for the poor simulation accuracy of the site although the overall performance was poor the empirical linear method accurately simulated the minimum value in july and the maximum value from august to october at this site in general it showed poor simulation accuracy at sites with a non unimodal distribution and a lack of strongly correlated related variables it should be noted that it could not determine the non unimodal distribution of le within the year due to the limited length of the observed data at some sites e g cn ser and cn ngo in fig 9e and g respectively 4 discussion 4 1 the dominant factors affecting evaporation at present there is no unified conclusion regarding the dominant factors affecting evaporation the main factors affecting evaporation obtained from different studies are not completely consistent which may be caused by the different study areas solar radiation factors rs and rn were the greatest driving forces for le at some observation sites giadrossich et al 2015 xiao et al 2018 ito and momii 2021 the mean contributions of rs and rn to annual le change were estimated to be 2 4 and 5 4 times larger than those of ta and rh respectively ito and momii 2021 in addition some studies have shown that aerodynamic variables u and vpd are the most important factors affecting water evaporation vpd was also found to be the dominant factor in estimating monthly and daily water surface evaporation while the effect of u was marginal singh and xu 1997 strachan et al 2016 however opposite research results have been reported rodrigues et al 2020 found that evaporation had the strongest correlation with u whereas it was weakly correlated with radiation factors instantaneous evaporation is primarily determined by u sene et al 1991 the dominant factors affecting evaporation might vary depending on the timescale size and depth of water bodies and other factors giadrossich et al 2015 friedrich et al 2018 aerodynamic variables vpd and u were the major impact factors at the diurnal scale whereas seasonal variations in evaporation were largely driven by temperature and net radiation lenters et al 2005 friedrich et al 2018 water surface evaporation has also been found to be mainly controlled by radiation and vpd during water heating and cooling giadrossich et al 2015 overall the results of this study showed that water surface evaporation had the strongest correlation with vpd on a daily scale but the correlation with u was relatively weak this is consistent with the results of strachan et al 2016 and singh and xu 1997 in addition according to the seven sites us twt us sne fr thl us rob de dgw jp swl and cn qin with daily series length greater than one year and relatively more observed variables this study found that the main factor affecting daily evaporation exhibited great differences among sites the main factors affecting le included radiation rn and rs vpd and u at these sites radiation factors were found to be the dominant factors affecting daily evaporation at the us twt and us sne sites with an r between the le and radiation variables 0 80 the sites with the strongest correlation between le and vpd included the fr thl r 0 95 and us rob r 0 62 sites the daily evaporation at the de dgw and jp swl sites was mainly determined by the vpd and radiation factors r 0 70 the correlation between u and le r 0 48 was significantly higher than that of the other factors in the cn qin sites at the first six sites the vpd and radiation factors showed a strong correlation with the le r 0 60 except for a weak correlation with radiation factors at the us rob site except for the us sne site the correlation between u and le was relatively weak at other sites especially at the fr thl de dgw and jp swl sites r 0 20 4 2 the simulation accuracy of different methods at different sites there were 26 evaporation methods divided into four types which were evaluated by ec measurements at 14 boreal sites the parameters were calibrated for each method by using the observed le at each site methods with calibrated parameters performed better than those without calibration the simulation accuracy of the calibrated methods was largely determined by the correlation between le and the input variables the optimal method with the highest accuracy varied among sites table s2 it was difficult to find a single approach that worked best for all sites however most sites 11 14 had one or more methods that could accurately simulate daily evaporation kge 0 70 except the cn ngo cn yay and us whb sites the simulation accuracy of the fluxnet sites was generally better than that of the sites indicated in the literature the main reason for this was that the former had all observed variables whereas the latter generally lacked measured variables the variables strongly correlated to le were always found at the fluxnet sites the variables observed from sites mentioned in the literature were often not strongly correlated with le while the variables missing from measurements might be strongly correlated with le overall the combination method with simultaneous calibration of the energy and aerodynamic terms and aerodynamic methods with double parameter calibration showed better performance in simulating daily water surface evaporation than other methods this is consistent with the evaluations by andreasen et al 2017 and fournier et al 2021 the results of this present study showed that the methods containing the term of rn δs including the breb type methods pt and penman methods performed relatively poorly and is consistent with the results of fournier et al 2021 neglecting the heat storage in the water column is the main reason for this in fact if δs is accurately simulated using the profile temperature of the water body these methods can accurately simulate water surface evaporation tanny et al 2008 tanny et al 2011 metzger et al 2018 the selection of the input variables for the empirical methods directly affects the simulation accuracy in the two variable empirical method combined with the ta and radiation variables the performance of the rs and ta combination was obviously better than that of the rn and ta combination this was consistent with the original form of the jensen haise method which combined rs and ta jensen and haise 1963 however for the combination of radiation variables and rh recommended by althoff et al 2019 rn and rh generally performed better than rs and rh therefore selecting an appropriate variable combination according to the characteristics of the observed sites is recommended when empirical methods are applied to simulate water surface evaporation the simulation accuracy based on the same set of parameters from all sites was also evaluated using the 26 evaporation methods the results showed that some methods exhibited high stability and robustness the simulation accuracy of these methods using unified parameters was slightly different from that of the calibration parameters for each site these mainly included combination methods with simultaneous calibration of the energy and aerodynamic terms the aerodynamic method based on the exponential function and the r based two variable empirical methods especially for the c ern3 apf4 method which showed the best model stability there are high expectations for accurate simulation using these calibrated parameters at other sites in other words it recommends using these calibration methods to simulate daily water surface evaporation in other regions on the other hand the simulation accuracy of most aerodynamic methods decreased significantly when unified parameters were used instead of calibration in each single site which indicated that it was important to calibrate parameters for each single site when applying these methods in estimating daily evaporation 4 3 limitations and uncertainties the limitations and uncertainties of this study were mainly due to data sources spatially due to the lack of observational data in the southern hemisphere it was only evaluated using boreal sites in this study in terms of temporal issues multi year observations are available only for a few sites the length of the observed data series in most sites was only one year or less therefore representation is relatively limited at these sites the observed data in the literature were digitized from the time series figures in this study but the process of digitalization is inevitably uncertain in the process of digitization figures are expanded as much as possible to improve the data accuracy however owing to the resolution of the figure the error in the data obtained from the literature was within 3 δs is essential for the simulation of water surface evaporation based on energy balance however it is difficult to directly measure δs it is usually simulated by numerical methods from observed data series of multi layer water temperatures however multilayer water temperature observations are not available at most sites this study assumed a linear relationship between δs and rn duan and bastiaanssen 2017 by using the linear relation between rn and calibrating parameters an accurate simulation was achieved at some sites however this solution had low simulation accuracy at most sites as mentioned above ignoring δs was the main reason for the poor simulation accuracy of the rn δs based methods the pt equation applies the term rn δs to simulate evaporation rn instead of rn δs was used in the pt equation in this study the optimal parameter value calibrated from multiple sites determined by rn was 1 03 which is less than the value of 1 26 as determined by priestley and taylor 1972 this is because the rn value is generally greater than the term rn δs in other words δs accounted for approximately 20 of rn the energy term in the penman equation has a similar problem this results in a deviation between the calibrated wind speed function and the original parameters in the penman equation the penman and pt equations are the most commonly used methods for simulating water surface evaporation however it is often difficult to obtain the δs data of the water heat storage change required by the equations which has a significant impact on the simulation accuracy this study used multisite observations to calibrate the optimal parameters of the δs free simulation the validation results showed that it was stable therefore the optimal parameters table s3 calibrated in this study are recommended to simulate the daily series of water surface evaporation when applying the penman and pt methods without the δs data in general the surface energy balance was non closure when calculated by measurements of rn le h and ground heat flux g at observation sites soil heat flux which is measured using heat flux plates near the ground surface is usually used as g in the calculation the difference between soil heat flux and g could be significant because of the soil heat storage within the layer from the surface to the flux plate wu et al 2020 the spatial scale of the soil heat flux observation is also much smaller than that of the le and h estimates the energy imbalance is also found in this study which is mainly due to the lack of measured δs it assumes that the measurements of le are accurate while the error and uncertainty of the measurements were not considered in this study in addition the performance of evaporation models was evaluated using ec observations the spatial scale of ec measurements is very limited compared with the lake area environmental conditions of the lake surface exhibited a certain spatial heterogeneity at large lakes especially between the shore and the center of the lake therefore the spatial distribution of lake evaporation needs further research the lack of measured variables may be the main reason for the poor simulation accuracy at some sites missing variables were mainly observed for sites in the literature conversely one or more methods with high simulation accuracy kge 0 7 could be found at the fluxnet sites because of the full range of observed variables the lack of measured variables strongly correlated with le was the main reason for poor performance at the three sites in the literature for example owing to the lack of measured radiation variables only aerodynamic methods could be applied at the us whb site it lacks the accuracy evaluation of the empirical and combination methods which might accurately simulate daily evaporation at this site none of the evaporation methods used in this study applied h which had the strongest correlation with the le at the cn ngo site fig 8 if the profile temperature of the water body was available for calculating δs achieving a high simulation accuracy at this site would have been expected using the initial breb model which is based on the correlation between h and le and on physical mechanism 5 conclusions based on eddy covariance measurements of 14 boreal flux sites the accuracy of 26 methods for simulating daily water surface evaporation was evaluated in this study overall the combination methods with simultaneous calibration of the energy and aerodynamic terms and the double parameter aerodynamic methods based on the linear and exponential functions showed the best performance with the median kge of evaluated sites ranging from 0 72 to 0 76 in each method most methods can accurately simulate daily evaporation at most observation sites with a kge 0 60 the breb type and single parameter aerodynamic methods performed relatively poorly with only a few sites having kge 0 60 the breb t the rs based two variable empirical methods the double parameter aerodynamic methods and the c ern3 aef4 method performed better than the other methods of the same type the accuracy of aerodynamic methods calibrated using exponential and power functions was significantly higher than that of the commonly used linear function at some sites but the improvement in the overall accuracy was limited the median re of the evaluated sites was within 10 for each method the breb type and aerodynamic methods tended to underestimate evaporation whereas the combination methods tended to overestimate evaporation when validated by an independent dataset the calibrated methods showed high stability at sites with high simulation accuracy while they showed relatively weak stability at sites with poor simulation accuracy the simulation accuracy of several methods using unified parameters from all evaluated sites showed little difference from the calibration for each single site including the combination methods a ef 1 e rh rs e ta rs and rs based single variable empirical e rs 1 e rs 2 and e rs 3 methods the c ern3 apf4 method exhibited the best model stability this indicated that the calibrated method was robust and showed high stability in simulating daily evaporation and was recommended for application in other sites or regions if δs data were unavailable the optimal parameters calibrated in this study would have been recommended for the application of the penman and pt equations to simulate daily water surface evaporation the breb t and seven aerodynamic methods except the a pf 1 and a ef 1 methods exhibited weak stability when simulated using unified parameters the method accurately simulated daily evaporation at most sites 11 14 with a kge 0 50 the model performance was better at the fr thl us twt us sne and cn ser sites where 75 of the methods were able to accurately simulate daily evaporation kge 0 80 the optimal methods with high accuracy varied from site to site the simulation accuracy of water surface evaporation at different sites was largely determined by the correlation between le and its related variables all methods performed poorly at the cn ngo cn yay and us whb sites which was mainly caused by the lack of measured variables with strong correlation with the le the fluxnet sites generally showed better performance than the literature sites which was mainly due to the full range of measured variables the sites with a unimodal distribution within the year showed the best model performance in simulating daily water surface evaporation particularly for sites with significant differences between the peak and trough values of the distribution the simulation accuracy of non unimodal distribution sites mainly depended on the correlation between the le and related variables input to the methods it generally showed poor simulation accuracy at sites with a non unimodal distribution and a lack of strongly correlated related variables the availability of more measured variables and a longer observed data series is expected to improve the simulation accuracy at these sites declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

2576,evaporation from the surface of water is a vital component of the hydrological cycle accurately simulating evaporation is crucial for modeling hydrological processes ensuring ecosystem water efficiency and managing water resources previous methods for evaluating evaporation have generally been limited to a single site and on a regional scale based on eddy covariance measurements of 14 boreal flux sites the accuracy of 26 methods for simulating daily water surface evaporation was comprehensively evaluated in this study most methods accurately simulated daily evaporation at most sites with a kge 0 60 the combination methods with simultaneous calibration of the energy and aerodynamic terms and the double parameter aerodynamic methods based on the linear and exponential functions showed the best performance with the median kge of the evaluated sites ranging from 0 72 to 0 76 the bowen ratio energy balance breb method embedded with tw rs based two variable empirical methods double parameter aerodynamic methods and the combination method of the energy term based on net radiation rn and the aerodynamic term based on the exponential function method performed better than the other methods of the same type the relative error re simulated by most methods was generally within 30 with the median re of all sites within 10 for each method the combination methods tended to overestimate the level of evaporation whereas the breb type and aerodynamic methods tended to underestimate the extent of evaporation the simulation accuracy of the daily evaporation showed significant variance among the sites it showed the best model performance at two fluxnet and two sites taken from the literature in which 75 of the methods were able to accurately simulate daily evaporation with a kling gupta efficiency kge 0 80 all methods performed poorly at the three sites from the literature and were mainly due to the lack of measured variables with a strong correlation with the latent heat flux le the fluxnet sites generally showed better performance the observed le of the sites with the best model performance generally showed a unimodal distribution throughout the year the simulation accuracy of non unimodal distribution sites mainly depended on the correlation between the le and related variables the combination of the energy term based on rn and the aerodynamic term based on the power function method showed the best model stability this finding indicated that the calibrated method was robust and showed high stability in simulating daily evaporation and it was recommended for application in other sites or regions the optimization of parameters calibrated in this study may improve the accuracy of simulating the daily evaporation for the application of the penman and priestley taylor equations when the water heat storage measurement is missing keywords water surface evaporation eddy covariance energy balance aerodynamic method penman priestley taylor data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction lakes and reservoirs play important roles in global water resources biodiversity and ecosystem services woolway et al 2020 lakes comprise 87 of the earth s liquid surface freshwater and are sensitive to climate change wang et al 2018 vystavna et al 2021 evaporation from the water surface is a vital component of the hydrological cycle condon et al 2020 zhao and gao 2019 worldwide up to 50 of reservoirs capacity and approximately 20 of the water inflow in global lakes are lost due to evaporation zhao and gao 2019 abdallah et al 2021 evaporation losses from reservoirs are greater than the industrial and domestic water consumption zhao and gao 2019 accurate simulation of evaporation is crucial for modeling hydrological processes optimizing ecosystem water efficiency and managing water resources ponce campos et al 2013 wang et al 2018 jansen and teuling 2020 various methods have been used to simulate evaporation from water bodies they can be subdivided into six major types friedrich et al 2018 jansen and teuling 2020 fournier et al 2021 zolá et al 2019 namely the pan coefficient method water balance method energy budget approaches empirical relations with related variables aerodynamic methods also called mass transfer or bulk transfer and combination methods e g the penman equation combining the energy and aerodynamic components the evaporation pan is an intuitive observation technique pan evaporation observations with a coefficient have also been used to evaluate other simulation methods singh and xu 1997 xu and singh 2000 losgedaragh and rahimzadegan 2018 however the relationship between evaporation and meteorological parameters differs in pan and open water bodies rodrigues et al 2020 the pan coefficient varies on both spatial and temporal scales yu et al 2017 anda et al 2018 rodrigues et al 2021 in the absence of measured data water balance or energy budget methods are generally used to evaluate other methods of simulating evaporation from the water surface for example the monthly water balance method was used to evaluate the accuracy of the three aerodynamic methods in a medium sized lake shilo et al 2015 this method is mainly limited to lakes in which hydrological process variables are observed in addition they are limited to long timescales liu et al 2019a the monthly energy budget method has also been used to evaluate the evaporation pan coefficient and aerodynamic parameters sacks et al 1994 winter et al 1995 more studies have used estimates of the bowen ratio energy balance breb method as a reference to evaluate other methods dos reis and dias 1998 delclaux et al 2007 rosenberry et al 2007 majidi et al 2015 this method requires temperature observations of different water layers which are unavailable for most water bodies evaluations in shallow lake and dryland reservoirs using the evaporation pan coefficient method showed that the combination and energy budget approaches were the most precise evaporation models while the air temperature based methods had the lowest accuracy anda et al 2018 rodrigues et al 2021 conversely the performance of air temperature based methods was better than that of the combination method when the breb method was applied for evaluations at a reservoir in a semi arid region majidi et al 2015 the monthly and annual evaporation values simulated by some aerodynamic and radiation based methods agreed closely with the pan values singh and xu 1997 xu and singh 2000 excellent model performance of aerodynamic methods has been achieved using over water or local over land meteorological observations when evaluated by pan observations at a pit lake mcjannet et al 2017 however the model performance was reduced when off site data were used in general combination methods which require more input data showed the best performance when referenced by breb measurements winter et al 1995 rosenberry et al 2007 delclaux et al 2007 evaluations of empirical relations showed that simulations of relative humidity and solar radiation were in close agreement with the pan values at a small reservoir althoff et al 2019 equations that used air temperature combined with sunshine or dew point temperature as input variables performed better majidi et al 2015 rodrigues et al 2021 the eddy covariance ec technique which is the standard method used to measure evaporation is generally considered to be the most accurate measurement method tanny et al 2008 friedrich et al 2018 rodrigues et al 2020 ec measurements have been used as a reference to evaluate other evaporation simulation methods for several lakes and reservoirs tanny et al 2008 tanny et al 2011 evaluated five combination and aerodynamic methods based on ec observations of a reservoir in israel and found that the penman brutsaert and penman monteith unsworth models performed best in simulating the mean values the penman model agreed best with ec measurements in predicting the daily series with a nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient of only 0 30 andreasen et al 2017 evaluated the energy budget empirical relations and aerodynamic methods in a small lake in the usa and found that regression relations combined with energy and aerodynamic variables provided the best daily data compared with ec measurements the energy budget method was poor for simulating daily lake evaporation owing to large errors in lake heat storage metzger et al 2018 evaluated the breb priestley taylor pt penman and aerodynamic methods using ec observations of the dead sea the aerodynamic and penman equations with changes in water heat storage showed the best performance in simulating the daily series with a correlation coefficient r 0 90 the r values of the energy budget approaches breb and pt without changing the water heat storage were reduced to 0 70 fournier et al 2021 evaluated pt penman and empirical and aerodynamic methods using ec measurements at two canadian reservoirs the aerodynamic methods with calibrated parameters showed the best performance with the r values of the two reservoirs being 0 70 and 0 90 respectively the pt and penman equations showed poor performance r 0 20 in general previous research has largely evaluated evaporation methods on a regional scale and has been limited to a single site however there is a relative lack of comparative assessments from multiple sites at present there are an increasing number of ec observation sites this provides a good opportunity to assess evaporation methods at multi site scales ec measurements were used to comprehensively evaluate the ability of various evaporation methods to accurately simulate daily evaporation at the boreal flux sites this study addresses four key objectives 1 evaluating the accuracy of 26 evaporation methods in simulating daily water surface evaporation at 14 boreal flux sites 2 investigating the variation in the performance of evaporation methods at each site 3 calibrating the optimal parameter values for each method at each site and testing the stability of the simulation accuracy of these methods and 4 investigating the spatial and temporal distribution of simulation accuracy at boreal flux sites 2 materials and methods 2 1 observation data boreal ec observations of water bodies were used in this study fig 1 these include the fluxnet ch4 community product knox et al 2019 and data from literature bouin et al 2012 cui et al 2021 feng et al 2016 goldbach and kuttler 2015 guo et al 2016 han et al 2020 li et al 2016 liu et al 2011 xiao et al 2018 there were four fluxnet ch4 sites covering lakes and wetlands and 10 sites taken from the literature covering lakes and reservoirs the longest observational record was 25 years whereas the shortest was less than one year the daily data series of ec measured latent heat flux le were used as references for evaluation while the observed incoming short wave radiation rs net radiation rn sensible heat flux h mean air temperature ta wind speed u atmospheric pressure p relative humidity rh vapor pressure deficit vpd and water surface temperature tw were used in the simulation of water surface evaporation all missing values were eliminated for example if there were missing values on a certain day all data on that day were discarded therefore only days with fully available half hourly data were used in the analysis it applied mean and standard deviation approaches to detect outliers liu et al 2019b several variables were missing measurements at some literature sites table s1 2 2 methods of evaporation calculations the evaporation calculation methods used in this study are presented in table 1 it includes 26 methods and can be divided into four types breb empirical relations aerodynamic models and combination methods the breb sene 1991 one of energy budget approaches is described as follows 1 l e b r e b r n δ s 1 β l e b r e b f r n 1 β β h l e c p t w t a λ e s e a where δs is the change in heat storage in the water bodies cp is the specific heat capacity of the air β is the bowen ratio and λ is the latent heat of vaporization here es and ea represent the saturation vapor pressure at the water surface and in the atmosphere respectively because of the lack of profile temperature of the water body δs cannot be calculated referring to the study of duan and bastiaanssen 2017 this study assumed that there is a linear empirical relationship between rn and δs and used lebreb to simulate daily series of water surface evaporation in addition ficke 1972 and winter et al 2003 improved the breb method using water surface temperature this method is often used as a standard reference to evaluate other evaporation methods rosenberry et al 2007 giadrossich et al 2015 majidi et al 2015 the empirical relation method with single variable generally uses radiation variables rn or rs to simulate le this type of method is also called radiation based method singh and xu 2000 it can be expressed as follows 2 l e f x a x b where is rs or rn and a and b are parameters to be calibrated based on double parameter and single parameter six radiation based methods table 1 are evaluated the e rn 3 method is the pt method priestley and taylor 1972 according to the optimal variables evaluated by majidi et al 2015 and althoff et al 2019 four methods composed of ta and rh and radiation factors were selected table 1 the method combined by ta and rs e ta rs was proposed by jensen and haise 1963 aerodynamic models are generally represented as follows 3 l e f u e s e a where u is the mean wind speed es ea is the vpd and f is the wind speed function in addition to the most commonly used linear functions this study also evaluated four exponential and four power functions table 1 the penman equation is a classical combination method it includes the energy and aerodynamic terms of water surface evaporation the equation is expressed as follows 4 l e δ δ γ r n δ s γ δ γ f u e s e a where δ represents the slope of the saturation vapor pressure temperature relationship and γ is the psychrometric constant these variables were calculated according to allen et al 1998 δs was neglected because of data limitations in this study penman 1948 calibrated the wind speed function using observed data which have been widely applied in evaporation and evapotranspiration calculations in this study the optimal parameters of the wind speed function were calibrated using ec measurements of the water surface evaporation in addition four other combination methods table 1 which calibrate parameters of energy and aerodynamic terms at the same time were also evaluated 2 3 evaluation criteria the performance of these methods was evaluated using flux observation data the evaluation criteria included relative error re root mean square error rmse and kling gupta efficiency kge re and rmse represent bias deviation from the observed values while kge is indicative of the goodness of fit of the simulated and observed data series the best fit value was 1 0 while the goodness of fit deteriorated with increasing deviation from 1 0 the evaluation criteria were calculated as follows 5 r e 1 n i 1 n x m i x o i x o i 6 r m s e 1 n i 1 n x m i x m x o i x o 2 7 k g e 1 1 r 2 r e 2 1 s d m s d o 2 8 s d 1 n 1 i 1 n x i x 2 9 r i 1 n x o i x o x m i x m i 1 n x o i x o 2 i 1 n x m i x m 2 where x m i and x o i are the ith values of the modeled and observed et time series respectively n is the time series length x m and x o are the means of the modeled and observed et respectively and s d m and s d o are the standard deviations of the modeled and observed et respectively the parameters in each equation were calibrated according to daily data at each flux site the daily series of each site was randomly assigned to one of two datasets 80 to the calibration dataset and 20 to the validation dataset the random assignment process is repeated to generate 100 independent datasets the parameters of these methods were calibrated using the kge at each observation site 3 results 3 1 correlation between daily le and its related variables the correlation between the 10 variables and the daily series of le is shown in fig 2 in general vpd showed the strongest correlation with daily le with the median and mean values of r for all sites exceeding or close to 0 60 the r was 0 50 at most sites 10 13 the highest r value was found at the fr thl site 0 95 however the correlation between the vpd and le of the tibetan plateau lake sites cn qin cn yay and cn ngo in china is relatively weak especially at the cn ngo site r 0 05 radiation rs and rn and temperature ta and tw variables also showed strong positive correlations with daily le with the median r of all sites exceeding 0 50 rh was negatively correlated with daily le and the median r of all sites was close to 0 50 u and p were positively and negatively correlated respectively with daily le the median r was 0 26 and 0 28 respectively the correlation between water temperature change δtw and daily le was the weakest the correlation between daily le and related variables varied significantly at different sites for example vpd and temperature ta and tw were strongly correlated with le at the fr thl site r 0 90 while u and δtw were very weakly related to le r 0 1 the r between the le and its related variables at the plateau lake sites in china was within 0 50 3 2 evaluation of simulation accuracy among different methods for the methods containing the γ as shown in table 1 the simulation accuracy of γ calculated using the site altitude was compared with that simulated using a daily series of atmospheric pressure data the results showed little difference between the two groups table 2 therefore γ was calculated using site altitude in the following evaluations the accuracy of the 26 methods of simulation of water surface evaporation evaluated by the kge is shown in fig 3 to make full use of the observed data the same type of methods were first evaluated in fig 3a f among the breb type methods the breb t method embedded with tw performed better than the original breb method fig 3a the median kge at all sites increased from 0 07 to 0 33 three of the 12 sites had a kge 0 75 and the us twt site had the highest kge of 0 91 in the empirical relation methods the median kge of all evaluated sites was approximately 0 65 in each method except for the e rn 3 method fig 3b there was little difference between the rs based and rn based methods when the double parameter was calibrated the performance of the single parameter calibration was slightly worse than that of the double parameter calibration particularly for the e rn 3 method among the two variable empirical methods with ta the rs based method performed slightly better than the rn based method the median kge of all sites in the e ta rs and e ta rn methods were 0 67 and 0 62 respectively fig 3b and the median kge of all sites was 0 76 and 0 71 respectively fig 3c conversely rh combined with rn performed better than rh combined with rs the median kge of the e rh rs and e rh rn methods were 0 63 and 0 69 respectively the radiation variable combined with ta was slightly better than that combined with rh fig 3c however the rmse evaluation results showed that the performance of the rs based empirical method was significantly better than that of the rn based method fig s1 the number of evaluation sites for the aerodynamic methods was 12 which was the same as that for the breb type methods compared to the breb methods the simulation accuracy of the aerodynamic methods was significantly improved for example the median kge of the linear function method a lf increased to 0 71 the simulation accuracies of the power functions a pf 1 and a pf 2 and exponential functions a ef 1 and a ef 2 with double parameters were almost the same as that of the linear function the single parameter power function a pf 3 and exponential function a ef 3 methods perform relatively poorly with the corresponding median kge of 0 36 and 0 29 respectively the kge of the fr thl site was close to 0 90 whereas that of the other 11 sites was 0 5 another form of single parameter power and exponential function method a pf 4 and a ef 4 was also calibrated the optimal values of the power and exponential function were 0 5 and 0 2 see table 1 where the range of calibration values were 0 1 1 9 and 0 05 0 95 respectively compared with the a pf 3 and a ef 3 methods the median kge values of the a pf 4 and a ef 4 methods were increased to 0 70 and 0 65 respectively these two methods particularly the former showed simulation accuracies similar to those of the double parameter aerodynamic methods the simulation accuracy of the c p method after parameter optimization was improved compared to the penman equation with the original parameters table 2 and fig 3e four of the ten evaluated sites had a kge of 0 7 the simultaneous calibration of energy and aerodynamic terms in the combination method could obviously improve the simulation accuracy fig 3e especially the combination method of the energy term based on rn and the aerodynamic term based on the exponent function c ern3 aef4 the median kge of the 10 sites improved from 0 56 to 0 71 when the energy and aerodynamic terms were simultaneously calibrated the simulation accuracy showed little difference between the rn based and rs based methods or between the power function and exponential function fig 3f the simulation accuracies of the 26 methods according to the six sites used in all the methods are compared in fig 3g overall the combination methods with simultaneous calibration of the energy and aerodynamic terms c ern3 aef4 c ern3 apf4 c ers3 aef4 and c ers3 apf4 and the aerodynamic methods based on the linear and exponential functions a lf a pf 1 and a pf 2 showed the best performance the mean kge of the evaluated sites in each method ranged from 0 62 to 0 64 and the corresponding median ranged from 0 72 to 0 76 the kge of each method was 0 70 in all four fluxnet sites the e rs 1 e ta rs a pf 4 a ef 1 and a ef 2 methods also accurately estimated daily water surface evaporation at most sites with a mean kge of 0 60 or 0 61 the median kge of all sites was 0 76 particularly for the first two empirical methods the e rs 2 e rs 3 e rn 1 e rn 2 e ta rn and a ef 4 methods performed slightly worse than the previous methods the mean value of kge ranged from 0 57 to 0 59 and the median kge was generally higher than 0 71 the e rn 3 c p e rh rs and e rh rn methods performed worse than the previous methods but also with a kge above 0 60 at most sites the breb type and single parameter aerodynamic methods a pf 3 and a ef 3 performed relatively poorly with only a few sites with kge 0 60 the accuracy of the 26 methods evaluated by re fig 4 was generally consistent with that evaluated by kge the breb t r based two variable empirical methods the double parameter aerodynamic methods and the c ern3 aef4 method performed better than the other methods of the same type the re simulated by most methods was generally within 30 the median re of all the sites was within 10 for each method the breb type and aerodynamic methods tended to underestimate le fig 4a and d whereas the combination methods tended to overestimate le fig 4e and f fig 5 shows the performance of the c ern3 apf4 method on the calibration and validation datasets evaluated by re and kge respectively the median and mean values of re and kge simulated by 100 randomly sampled data series showed little difference between the calibration and validation periods at each site the results of the random sampling calibration and validation of other methods with better performance were similar to those of the c ern3 apf4 method not shown this indicates that the proposed methods are robust there was little difference between the calibration and validation periods at the sites with high simulation accuracy whereas there were large differences in the sites with relatively poor simulation accuracy random sampling had a greater impact on simulation accuracy at sites with relatively poor model performance for example the re of 100 samples of the cn qin site during the calibration period varied between 35 and 50 the variation expanded to 16 90 during the validation period random sampling had little impact on simulation accuracy at the fr thl us sne and us twt sites which had the best model performance the kge of 100 samples in the calibration period varied between 0 92 and 0 94 0 88 0 90 and 0 79 0 81 respectively the variation slightly increased in the validation but was also relatively stable between 0 89 and 0 95 0 85 0 92 and 0 77 0 84 respectively overall the evaporation method exhibited high stability robustness at sites with high simulation accuracy but relatively weak stability at sites with poor simulation accuracy 3 3 evaluation of simulation accuracy based on the same set of parameters from all sites the evaluation of the simulation accuracy when the parameters were calibrated at each site is shown in the previous section in this section the accuracy of the simulation based on the same set of parameters from all sites is evaluated for each evaporation method for sites with kge 0 5 the accuracy of each method using unified parameters from selected sites was also compared with those using calibrated parameters at each site fig 6 the number of sites selected for each method ranged from five to nine the simulation accuracy of each method using unified parameters was generally lower than that using calibrated parameters at each site the median kge of all sites for most methods 23 26 was between 0 71 and 0 80 when parameters were calibrated at each site if unified parameters from all or selected sites were applied the median kge for most methods 16 26 or 19 26 was generally reduced to between 0 55 and 0 59 the reduction in the simulation accuracy using unified parameters was relatively limited in some methods the c ern3 apf4 method exhibited the best model stability the median kge only decreased by 0 03 when unified parameters were used model stability was also found in the other three combination methods with simultaneous calibration of the energy and aerodynamic parameters c ers3 aef4 c ern3 aef4 and c ern3 apf4 the a ef 1 e rh rs and e ta rs methods with a decrease in the median kge of 0 09 when using unified parameters from all sites in addition the c p e rs 1 e rs 2 and e rs 3 methods were also relatively stable when using the unified parameters from the selected sites with the median kge decreasing between 0 06 and 0 08 however the simulation accuracy of some methods is significantly reduced by the unified parameters for example the median kge decreased by 0 30 in the breb t and the seven aerodynamic methods except the a pf 1 and a ef 1 methods when simulated by unified parameters from all sites if unified parameters from the selected sites were used the methods with the decrease of the median kge 0 30 were four aerodynamic methods a lf a ef 3 a ef 2 and a pf 2 the decrease of the median kge for unified parameters was generally between 0 10 and 0 29 in other methods 3 4 spatial and temporal distribution of simulation accuracy the frequency of the kge for all methods which included the maximum 75 50 and 25 frequency values was calculated at each site the spatial distribution of these statistics is shown in fig 7 most sites 11 14 found an accurate method to simulate the daily series of water surface evaporation with a maximum kge 0 5 the best model performance was observed at the fr thl site with a median kge of 0 93 for all methods the kge was 0 85 for almost all methods except for the breb type methods and empirical methods with a single variable it also showed the ability to accurately simulate daily evaporation at the us twt us sne and cn ser sites where 75 of the methods had a kge 0 80 this indicated that most of the methods were able to accurately simulate daily evaporation at these sites the optimal methods with high accuracy varied from site to site for example most methods 17 26 including the breb empirical relation and combination type methods had a kge 0 80 at the us sne site except for nine aerodynamic methods conversely the aerodynamic methods performed better than the other types of methods at the cn ser site especially the double parameter aerodynamic methods with kge 0 80 the kge simulated using the optimal method was approximately 0 75 at the de dgw jp swl and us rob sites most methods 75 accurately simulated daily evaporation at these sites with a kge 0 70 apart from the breb methods at the de dgw site where they showed poor performance kge 0 35 the other methods showed kge 0 70 at these sites the model performance was also satisfactory at the de sub cn poy cn qin and cn erh sites with the optimal kge simulated at these sites ranging from 0 50 to 0 70 in general the simulation accuracy of water surface evaporation at different sites was positively correlated with the correlation between le and its related variables fig 8 a higher simulation accuracy was generally found at sites with a stronger correlation between le and related variables for example ta and vpd which are closely related to the aerodynamic term for evaporation were strongly correlated with le r 0 90 at the fr thl site the r between the le and radiation variables associated with the evaporation energy term was also 0 80 at this site the strongest correlation between the le and related variables in the evaporation method was the main reason for the best model performance at this site this study also evaluated the simulation accuracy of the linear empirical relationship between each single related variable and the le the results showed that the accuracy was proportional to the correlation between le and the related variable therefore if there are related variables strongly correlated with le it is recommended to use the linear empirical relation to simulate evaporation for example there was a strong correlation between u and le in the cn erh site r was close to 0 80 and the simulation accuracy of the corresponding linear empirical relation kge 0 74 was much greater than that of the other optimal methods kge 0 51 all methods performed poorly at the cn ngo cn yay and us whb sites with the kge of each method being lower than 0 30 this was due to the relatively weak correlation between le and the related variables at these sites fig 8 for example in the first two tibetan plateau lake sites cn ngo and cn yay the r between the le and related variables used in evaporation methods except h was within 0 40 the impact of the temporal distribution characteristics of the le series on simulation accuracy was analyzed the data series of the observed and simulated le and its strongly correlated related variables at several representative sites are shown in fig 9 the sites with a unimodal distribution within the year showed the best model performance in simulating daily water surface evaporation particularly for sites with significant differences between the peak and trough values of the distribution for example the optimal kge of the fr thl and us sne sites was 0 96 and 0 90 respectively the le at the two sites showed a relatively sharp unimodal distribution in the annual cycle with the difference between the peak and trough values exceeding 100 w m2 fig 9a and b although the le of the jp swl site also exhibited a unimodal distribution within the observed year the kge of the optimal method was 0 75 this might have been caused by the relatively flat distribution at this site fig 9c the simulation accuracy of non unimodal distribution sites mainly depended on the correlation between the le and related variables input to the methods if there were variables strongly correlated with le the method with these variables as inputs could accurately simulate daily evaporation fig 9d and e for example the le was strongly correlated with the u and vpd at the us rob r 0 37 and 0 62 respectively and cn ser r 0 63 and 0 55 respectively sites and the kge of the a lf and a ef 2 methods with the u and vpd as inputs were 0 74 and 0 82 respectively similar results for the other seven sites could be found in fig s2 the weak correlation between the input related factors and le fig 8 is the main reason for the poor performance of the common methods used table 1 therefore for sites with general model performance the variables strongly correlated with le were selected to establish the corresponding empirical linear relation methods the simulation accuracy of the calibrated methods was significantly improved compared with the common methods with the optimal kge of the cn ngo us whb cn yay and cn erh sites increasing from 0 22 0 23 0 02 and 0 49 to 0 43 0 46 0 39 and 0 73 respectively the simulated daily le of the first two sites are shown in fig 9f and g although the empirical linear method improved the simulation accuracy the model performance was still unsatisfactory kge 0 5 because the r between the le and the strongest correlated variable was only approximately 0 40 the simulation accuracy of the us whb site was poor which might have been mainly due to large errors in simulating the extreme values of daily le this tended to underestimate the peak values and overestimate the trough values in other words the variation coefficient of the simulated series of le was significantly lower than the observed values this is because the variation coefficient of the daily series of mean air temperature which was an input to the model was much lower than that of the le this greatly overestimated le in june and july and generally underestimated le from august to october at the cn ngo site this is the main reason for the poor simulation accuracy of the site although the overall performance was poor the empirical linear method accurately simulated the minimum value in july and the maximum value from august to october at this site in general it showed poor simulation accuracy at sites with a non unimodal distribution and a lack of strongly correlated related variables it should be noted that it could not determine the non unimodal distribution of le within the year due to the limited length of the observed data at some sites e g cn ser and cn ngo in fig 9e and g respectively 4 discussion 4 1 the dominant factors affecting evaporation at present there is no unified conclusion regarding the dominant factors affecting evaporation the main factors affecting evaporation obtained from different studies are not completely consistent which may be caused by the different study areas solar radiation factors rs and rn were the greatest driving forces for le at some observation sites giadrossich et al 2015 xiao et al 2018 ito and momii 2021 the mean contributions of rs and rn to annual le change were estimated to be 2 4 and 5 4 times larger than those of ta and rh respectively ito and momii 2021 in addition some studies have shown that aerodynamic variables u and vpd are the most important factors affecting water evaporation vpd was also found to be the dominant factor in estimating monthly and daily water surface evaporation while the effect of u was marginal singh and xu 1997 strachan et al 2016 however opposite research results have been reported rodrigues et al 2020 found that evaporation had the strongest correlation with u whereas it was weakly correlated with radiation factors instantaneous evaporation is primarily determined by u sene et al 1991 the dominant factors affecting evaporation might vary depending on the timescale size and depth of water bodies and other factors giadrossich et al 2015 friedrich et al 2018 aerodynamic variables vpd and u were the major impact factors at the diurnal scale whereas seasonal variations in evaporation were largely driven by temperature and net radiation lenters et al 2005 friedrich et al 2018 water surface evaporation has also been found to be mainly controlled by radiation and vpd during water heating and cooling giadrossich et al 2015 overall the results of this study showed that water surface evaporation had the strongest correlation with vpd on a daily scale but the correlation with u was relatively weak this is consistent with the results of strachan et al 2016 and singh and xu 1997 in addition according to the seven sites us twt us sne fr thl us rob de dgw jp swl and cn qin with daily series length greater than one year and relatively more observed variables this study found that the main factor affecting daily evaporation exhibited great differences among sites the main factors affecting le included radiation rn and rs vpd and u at these sites radiation factors were found to be the dominant factors affecting daily evaporation at the us twt and us sne sites with an r between the le and radiation variables 0 80 the sites with the strongest correlation between le and vpd included the fr thl r 0 95 and us rob r 0 62 sites the daily evaporation at the de dgw and jp swl sites was mainly determined by the vpd and radiation factors r 0 70 the correlation between u and le r 0 48 was significantly higher than that of the other factors in the cn qin sites at the first six sites the vpd and radiation factors showed a strong correlation with the le r 0 60 except for a weak correlation with radiation factors at the us rob site except for the us sne site the correlation between u and le was relatively weak at other sites especially at the fr thl de dgw and jp swl sites r 0 20 4 2 the simulation accuracy of different methods at different sites there were 26 evaporation methods divided into four types which were evaluated by ec measurements at 14 boreal sites the parameters were calibrated for each method by using the observed le at each site methods with calibrated parameters performed better than those without calibration the simulation accuracy of the calibrated methods was largely determined by the correlation between le and the input variables the optimal method with the highest accuracy varied among sites table s2 it was difficult to find a single approach that worked best for all sites however most sites 11 14 had one or more methods that could accurately simulate daily evaporation kge 0 70 except the cn ngo cn yay and us whb sites the simulation accuracy of the fluxnet sites was generally better than that of the sites indicated in the literature the main reason for this was that the former had all observed variables whereas the latter generally lacked measured variables the variables strongly correlated to le were always found at the fluxnet sites the variables observed from sites mentioned in the literature were often not strongly correlated with le while the variables missing from measurements might be strongly correlated with le overall the combination method with simultaneous calibration of the energy and aerodynamic terms and aerodynamic methods with double parameter calibration showed better performance in simulating daily water surface evaporation than other methods this is consistent with the evaluations by andreasen et al 2017 and fournier et al 2021 the results of this present study showed that the methods containing the term of rn δs including the breb type methods pt and penman methods performed relatively poorly and is consistent with the results of fournier et al 2021 neglecting the heat storage in the water column is the main reason for this in fact if δs is accurately simulated using the profile temperature of the water body these methods can accurately simulate water surface evaporation tanny et al 2008 tanny et al 2011 metzger et al 2018 the selection of the input variables for the empirical methods directly affects the simulation accuracy in the two variable empirical method combined with the ta and radiation variables the performance of the rs and ta combination was obviously better than that of the rn and ta combination this was consistent with the original form of the jensen haise method which combined rs and ta jensen and haise 1963 however for the combination of radiation variables and rh recommended by althoff et al 2019 rn and rh generally performed better than rs and rh therefore selecting an appropriate variable combination according to the characteristics of the observed sites is recommended when empirical methods are applied to simulate water surface evaporation the simulation accuracy based on the same set of parameters from all sites was also evaluated using the 26 evaporation methods the results showed that some methods exhibited high stability and robustness the simulation accuracy of these methods using unified parameters was slightly different from that of the calibration parameters for each site these mainly included combination methods with simultaneous calibration of the energy and aerodynamic terms the aerodynamic method based on the exponential function and the r based two variable empirical methods especially for the c ern3 apf4 method which showed the best model stability there are high expectations for accurate simulation using these calibrated parameters at other sites in other words it recommends using these calibration methods to simulate daily water surface evaporation in other regions on the other hand the simulation accuracy of most aerodynamic methods decreased significantly when unified parameters were used instead of calibration in each single site which indicated that it was important to calibrate parameters for each single site when applying these methods in estimating daily evaporation 4 3 limitations and uncertainties the limitations and uncertainties of this study were mainly due to data sources spatially due to the lack of observational data in the southern hemisphere it was only evaluated using boreal sites in this study in terms of temporal issues multi year observations are available only for a few sites the length of the observed data series in most sites was only one year or less therefore representation is relatively limited at these sites the observed data in the literature were digitized from the time series figures in this study but the process of digitalization is inevitably uncertain in the process of digitization figures are expanded as much as possible to improve the data accuracy however owing to the resolution of the figure the error in the data obtained from the literature was within 3 δs is essential for the simulation of water surface evaporation based on energy balance however it is difficult to directly measure δs it is usually simulated by numerical methods from observed data series of multi layer water temperatures however multilayer water temperature observations are not available at most sites this study assumed a linear relationship between δs and rn duan and bastiaanssen 2017 by using the linear relation between rn and calibrating parameters an accurate simulation was achieved at some sites however this solution had low simulation accuracy at most sites as mentioned above ignoring δs was the main reason for the poor simulation accuracy of the rn δs based methods the pt equation applies the term rn δs to simulate evaporation rn instead of rn δs was used in the pt equation in this study the optimal parameter value calibrated from multiple sites determined by rn was 1 03 which is less than the value of 1 26 as determined by priestley and taylor 1972 this is because the rn value is generally greater than the term rn δs in other words δs accounted for approximately 20 of rn the energy term in the penman equation has a similar problem this results in a deviation between the calibrated wind speed function and the original parameters in the penman equation the penman and pt equations are the most commonly used methods for simulating water surface evaporation however it is often difficult to obtain the δs data of the water heat storage change required by the equations which has a significant impact on the simulation accuracy this study used multisite observations to calibrate the optimal parameters of the δs free simulation the validation results showed that it was stable therefore the optimal parameters table s3 calibrated in this study are recommended to simulate the daily series of water surface evaporation when applying the penman and pt methods without the δs data in general the surface energy balance was non closure when calculated by measurements of rn le h and ground heat flux g at observation sites soil heat flux which is measured using heat flux plates near the ground surface is usually used as g in the calculation the difference between soil heat flux and g could be significant because of the soil heat storage within the layer from the surface to the flux plate wu et al 2020 the spatial scale of the soil heat flux observation is also much smaller than that of the le and h estimates the energy imbalance is also found in this study which is mainly due to the lack of measured δs it assumes that the measurements of le are accurate while the error and uncertainty of the measurements were not considered in this study in addition the performance of evaporation models was evaluated using ec observations the spatial scale of ec measurements is very limited compared with the lake area environmental conditions of the lake surface exhibited a certain spatial heterogeneity at large lakes especially between the shore and the center of the lake therefore the spatial distribution of lake evaporation needs further research the lack of measured variables may be the main reason for the poor simulation accuracy at some sites missing variables were mainly observed for sites in the literature conversely one or more methods with high simulation accuracy kge 0 7 could be found at the fluxnet sites because of the full range of observed variables the lack of measured variables strongly correlated with le was the main reason for poor performance at the three sites in the literature for example owing to the lack of measured radiation variables only aerodynamic methods could be applied at the us whb site it lacks the accuracy evaluation of the empirical and combination methods which might accurately simulate daily evaporation at this site none of the evaporation methods used in this study applied h which had the strongest correlation with the le at the cn ngo site fig 8 if the profile temperature of the water body was available for calculating δs achieving a high simulation accuracy at this site would have been expected using the initial breb model which is based on the correlation between h and le and on physical mechanism 5 conclusions based on eddy covariance measurements of 14 boreal flux sites the accuracy of 26 methods for simulating daily water surface evaporation was evaluated in this study overall the combination methods with simultaneous calibration of the energy and aerodynamic terms and the double parameter aerodynamic methods based on the linear and exponential functions showed the best performance with the median kge of evaluated sites ranging from 0 72 to 0 76 in each method most methods can accurately simulate daily evaporation at most observation sites with a kge 0 60 the breb type and single parameter aerodynamic methods performed relatively poorly with only a few sites having kge 0 60 the breb t the rs based two variable empirical methods the double parameter aerodynamic methods and the c ern3 aef4 method performed better than the other methods of the same type the accuracy of aerodynamic methods calibrated using exponential and power functions was significantly higher than that of the commonly used linear function at some sites but the improvement in the overall accuracy was limited the median re of the evaluated sites was within 10 for each method the breb type and aerodynamic methods tended to underestimate evaporation whereas the combination methods tended to overestimate evaporation when validated by an independent dataset the calibrated methods showed high stability at sites with high simulation accuracy while they showed relatively weak stability at sites with poor simulation accuracy the simulation accuracy of several methods using unified parameters from all evaluated sites showed little difference from the calibration for each single site including the combination methods a ef 1 e rh rs e ta rs and rs based single variable empirical e rs 1 e rs 2 and e rs 3 methods the c ern3 apf4 method exhibited the best model stability this indicated that the calibrated method was robust and showed high stability in simulating daily evaporation and was recommended for application in other sites or regions if δs data were unavailable the optimal parameters calibrated in this study would have been recommended for the application of the penman and pt equations to simulate daily water surface evaporation the breb t and seven aerodynamic methods except the a pf 1 and a ef 1 methods exhibited weak stability when simulated using unified parameters the method accurately simulated daily evaporation at most sites 11 14 with a kge 0 50 the model performance was better at the fr thl us twt us sne and cn ser sites where 75 of the methods were able to accurately simulate daily evaporation kge 0 80 the optimal methods with high accuracy varied from site to site the simulation accuracy of water surface evaporation at different sites was largely determined by the correlation between le and its related variables all methods performed poorly at the cn ngo cn yay and us whb sites which was mainly caused by the lack of measured variables with strong correlation with the le the fluxnet sites generally showed better performance than the literature sites which was mainly due to the full range of measured variables the sites with a unimodal distribution within the year showed the best model performance in simulating daily water surface evaporation particularly for sites with significant differences between the peak and trough values of the distribution the simulation accuracy of non unimodal distribution sites mainly depended on the correlation between the le and related variables input to the methods it generally showed poor simulation accuracy at sites with a non unimodal distribution and a lack of strongly correlated related variables the availability of more measured variables and a longer observed data series is expected to improve the

2577,china has implemented a series of ambitious soil and water conservation swc projects on the chinese loess plateau which have significantly changed the erosion transport and deposition of sediment as a result the sediment flux of the yellow river once the largest carrier of fluvial sediment worldwide has been reduced by approximately 85 in the past 60 years however the effects of swc measures on erosion transport and deposition of sediment are still difficult to quantify which greatly limits the further planning and adjustment of swc measures here we determined soil erosion sediment deposition and sediment yield at different historical stages in a 187 km2 hilly and gully watershed on the chinese loess plateau using the unmanned aerial vehicle uav photogrammetry technology combined with check dam surveying and hydrologic monitoring the results show that the construction of check dams and vegetation restoration significantly reduced the soil erosion rate from 21 144 t km 2 yr 1 at stage 1 1960 1969 to 13 819 3 622 t km 2 yr 1 at stage 2 1970 1999 and further to 4 723 1 278 t km 2 yr 1 at stage 3 2000 2018 the sediment deposition rate was estimated to be 5 989 and 2 582 351 t km 2 yr 1 at stage 2 and stage 3 respectively the variation in the erosion and deposition of sediment led to a significant change in the sediment delivery ratio from 1 at stage 1 to 0 57 at stage 2 and 0 45 at stage 3 our research results provide an important reference for further swc planning keywords sediment delivery ratio soil erosion chinese loess plateau sediment yield check dam unmanned aerial vehicle data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction accelerated soil erosion is one of the most important environmental problems worldwide and is usually accompanied by nonpoint source pollution and land degradation alewell et al 2020 borrelli et al 2017 lal 2017 the process of soil erosion involves soil detachment in the source area sediment deposition in the sink area and sediment transport in fluvial channels doetterl et al 2016 nearing et al 2017 understanding the linkage of different erosion processes and quantifying their fluxes are essential for predicting sediment yield based on local soil erosion rates evaluating the transport of nutrients and pollutants and estimating field land degradation rates nowak and schneider 2017 overeem et al 2017 systematic understanding of the subprocesses of soil erosion has always been a challenge in the field the concept of the sediment delivery ratio sdr connects on site soil erosion and off site sediment yield within a watershed walling 1983 the sdr is defined as the ratio of the measured sediment flux transport through a certain section of the river to the total amount of eroded sediment in a watershed above the section which reflects the ability of water flow to transport eroded sediment walling 1983 the sdr is an effective research tool worldwide to systematically evaluate the regional and watershed scale soil erosion process for example lal 2003 estimated that the total amount of global annual eroded sediment is about 75 billion t based on global river sediment flux and compiled large scale river sdr data rajbanshi and bhattacharya 2020 combined the revised universal soil loss equation rusle model and sdr to evaluate soil erosion and specific sediment yield at watershed scale and determined that topographic factors and mean annual precipitation are the most important factors affecting soil erosion and sediment yield accurate quantification of sediment delivery processes within a watershed lays the foundation for elucidating the changes in erosion deposition and output in the sdr the sediment yield of a watershed can be obtained through the high frequency monitoring of researchers or hydrological stations with high accuracy mao et al 2009 in contrast it has always been difficult to accurately estimate the soil erosion at watershed scale plot observations soil erosion models and isotope tracing methods are usually employed to construct the soil erosion rate boix fayos et al 2006 porto et al 2018 rajbanshi and bhattacharya 2020 however these methods are either labour consuming and material intensive or are associated with unignorable calculation errors and are limited to a few watersheds brown et al 2009 the sediment deposition process at watershed scale usually includes the sediment interception of dam vegetation and terrace or the local deposits of floodplain alluvial fan and alluvial fan which is difficult to measure and simulate xu 2003 therefore sediment deposition rate is usually obtained by subtracting sediment yield from soil erosion rate at watershed scale and its accuracy will be affected by the estimation errors of sediment yield and soil erosion rate swarnkar et al 2018 zhou et al 2019 that is a considerable number of sediment delivery studies regard the deposition process as a black box garcia ruiz et al 2015 walling 1983 overall there are still great challenges in the quantification of soil erosion and sediment deposition on watershed scale which brings great uncertainty to quantifying the change of sediment delivery in complex erosion process the chinese loess plateau clp is the most seriously eroded region worldwide with an annual soil erosion rate of more than 5000 t km 2 zhao et al 2013 the extremely high soil erosion rate is accompanied by tremendously high sediment flux into the bohai sea with an average of approximately 1 6 billion t yr 1 from 1919 to 1960 wu et al 2008 large amounts of sediment delivered to the river have blocked the channels and reservoirs raised the riverbed and further caused flooding posing a serious threat to the people downstream ben slimane et al 2015 wang et al 2017 under this background many studies on the sdr have been carried out on the clp to deeply understand the mechanism of sediment delivery and to further control soil erosion fang et al 2008 wang et al 2018a gong and xiong 1981 indicated that the sdr at the watershed scale of the clp is approximately 1 by analysing measured data at hydrological stations from 1959 to 1969 in both small and large watersheds zheng et al 2014 revealed that the sdr remained stable values ranging from 1 1 to 1 3 during extreme flood events by analysing data measured at plot and watershed scales during the period from 1959 to 1969 these studies have determined the sdr at watershed scale in the period when swc projects are not carried out on the clp and have been widely recognized and applied however numerous check dams were built on different levels of gullies or rivers on the clp to intercept eroded sediment from 1970 to the 2000 s jin et al 2012 by 2011 56 065 check dams in good operation on the clp intercepted 5 7 billion m3 of sediment cmwr 2013 additionally the grain for green program ggp has been carried out on the clp since 1999 which is the largest ever vegetation restoration program worldwide the primary objective of the ggp is to restore steep slopes greater than 25 to grassland or forest which significantly increased the vegetation coverage of the clp from 31 6 in 1999 to 59 6 in 2013 chen et al 2015 check dams and vegetation restoration have greatly changed the sediment delivery processes at watershed scale zhou et al 2019 leading to the change of sdr at watershed scale from close to 1 no swc period to an unknown value however due to the complex effects of check dams and vegetation restoration on erosion transport and deposition process it is still difficult to quantify sdr at watershed scale in the context of current ecological restoration given that changes in the sediment delivery processes will significantly affect water sediment regulation swc planning and the regional ecological environment wang et al 2015 it is crucial to assess and quantify the impact of swc measures on sediment delivery processes check dam constructed in a headwater watershed can intercept all eroded sediment including suspended load and bed load fang et al 2019 as a consequence the sediment trapped by a check dam in a headwater watershed can be utilized to quantify the soil erosion rate and all sediment behind all the check dams within a watershed can be used to calculate the deposition rate wei et al 2018 recently the unmanned aerial vehicle uav photogrammetry technology has been widely used to estimate the storage capacity in deposition areas worldwide because of the advantages of simple operation low cost and high precision alfonso torreno et al 2019 huang et al 2021 rodrigues et al 2021 in combination with check dam surveying and uav photogrammetry techniques we analysed and quantified the sediment delivery processes within a hilly and gully watershed on the clp the objectives of our study are 1 to accurately estimate the soil erosion rate and sediment deposition rate at watershed scale combined with the uav photogrammetry method 2 to determine the sediment budget and sdr at different historical stages and 3 to clarify the effects of check dams and vegetation restoration on the sediment delivery processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the 187 km2 chabagou cbg watershed 109 47 18 to 110 02 22 e 37 38 09 to 37 47 37 n is located in zizhou county shaanxi province and is a third order tributary of the yellow river fig 1 a the cbg watershed has a dry continental climate with an average annual precipitation of 414 mm precipitation mainly occurs in the wet season july to september resulting in approximately 62 runoff and approximately 90 sediment concentration in this period yu et al 2014 from 1960 to 1969 hereinafter abbreviated as stage 1 due to food shortages almost all areas 80 in the cbg watershed were extensively cultivated except for the areas that were too steep zheng et al 2015a this has led to serious soil erosion in the cbg watershed with a maximum annual sediment yield exceeding 70 000 t km 2 to control severe soil erosion a series of swc measures have been carried out in the cbg watershed since the 1970 s fig 2 from 1970 to 1999 stage 2 with the improvement of check dam construction technology many check dams were built to reduce soil erosion fig 1c the dam body material of these check dams is mainly composed of loess mud and the height of the dam body ranges from 10 m to 40 m these check dams intercept a large amount of eroded sediment forming silted land that can be planted fig 2a 2b after 2000 stage 3 the construction of new check dams greatly slowed and the strategy was revised to maintain and reinforce existing check dams guo et al 2021 meanwhile large scale vegetation restoration was carried out in the cbg watershed and a large area of cropland was converted into grassland or forest by 2017 there were 139 km2 of grassland and forest in the cbg watershed approximately 74 of the watershed area zeng et al 2020a a national basic hydrological station was set up at the outlet of the watershed recording daily runoff and sediment data since the 1950 s all sampling and measuring procedures follow the chinese national standards code for liquid flow measurement in open channels gb50179 2015 code for measurement of suspended load in open channels gb 50159 2015 the hydrological station is equipped with 13 weather stations evenly distributed in the cbg watershed which provide the multi year precipitation data of the watershed additionally the local water authorities conducted a detailed survey on check dams in the cbg watershed in 1999 this survey contents include the number sediment volume and construction year of the check dams check dams are usually built by local water authorities or village level administrative units with detailed written records therefore the number and the construction year of the check dams in the survey report have high credibility in contrast due to the limitation of sediment volume estimation method the credibility of sediment volume data of check dams is low 2 2 sediment volume estimation of check dams based on uav photogrammetry due to the complexity of gully morphology and the inaccessibility of historical topographical data the true sediment volume retained by check dams is very difficult to estimate our recent research has established a method for estimating the sediment volume of check dams based on uav photogrammetry zeng et al 2022 here we apply this method to estimate the sediment volume of check dam in the cbg watershed and further invert the soil erosion rate and sediment deposition rate at watershed scale in section 2 3 the basic idea of this method is that due to similar geological structure climate and hydrological characteristics the gully shape usually shows topographic similarity on a local such as small watershed scale liu et al 2020b veneziano and niemann 2000 therefore the empty gullies without check dam can be used to simulate the 3 d topography of real check dam which has not been buried by sediment this method involves four steps 1 obtaining high resolution digital elevation model dem of the selected empty gullies 2 simulating the construction of check dams in empty gullies 3 simulating the sediment deposition process in empty gullies and quantifying key topographic parameters and 4 fitting and estimating the sediment deposition behind check dams fig 3 according to the following principles 37 suitable empty gullies were selected fig 1c 1 these empty gullies are evenly distributed in or near the cbg watershed and have similar topography and landforms 2 these empty gullies are distributed in the watershed with check dam distribution to ensure that these simulated empty gullies were comparable to the actual check dams from september 2020 to may 2021 we used a dji phantom 4 rtk uav to obtain images of these empty gullies through several preflights we set the flying altitude heading phase and side phase overlap parameters at 100 m 80 and 70 respectively to ensure the best shooting effect we used agisoft photoscan professional 1 2 6 to perform the uav imagery and obtained the dem of these empty gullies with a resolution of 0 12 0 24 m then we imported these high resolution dem data into arcgis 10 5 software and added the check dam raster layers converted from vector layers at the appropriate location usually the outlet of a gully to simulated the construction of check dams in these empty gullies next we used the fill a lake tool in the hydrologic modelling of qgis software to simulate the siltation process of check dams in the selected empty gullies to obtain the submerged area silted land area and submerged volume sediment volume corresponding to different submerged depths we then fit the silted land area sediment volume curve area volume relationships of small silted land area is 0 2 hm2 and medium sized silted land area is 2 7 hm2 check dams according to multiple sets of silted land area and the corresponding sediment volume the check dams are classified according to regulation of techniques for comprehensive control of soil erosion technique for erosion control of gullies gbt16453 3 1996 zeng et al 2022 based on the above area volume relationships we only need to obtain the silted land area of each check dam to accurately estimate the sediment volume of check dams we first obtained the high resolution images of the cbg watershed in may 2018 plowing period from google earth which has the most easily identified outline features of the silted land of check dams then the silted land of all check dams in the cbg watershed was extracted based on visual interpretation to improve the accuracy of silted land area we combine color shape texture as well as expert knowledge to visually interpret the silted land in google earth yang and lu 2014 due to the significant difference between the silted land and the surrounding landscape the error caused by manual boundary extraction can be ignored supplementary fig s1 for small sized and medium sized check dams we substituted the extracted silted land area into the above fitting formula to calculate the corresponding sediment volume key check dams or large sized check dams are usually built by water authorities with detailed original topographic data and reservoir capacity curve information recorded for key check dams we obtained the sediment volume from official data more detailed description and accuracy verification of this sediment volume estimation method for check dam can be found in zeng et al 2022 2 3 sediment budget at watershed scale soil erosion at the watershed scale usually includes soil detachment in eroded source areas transportation in gullies or rivers and deposition in sink areas doetterl et al 2016 the corresponding sediment budget is described as follows ran et al 2014 zeng et al 2020a 1 e i y i d i where e i y i and d i represent the respective soil erosion rate sediment yield and sediment deposition rate of the watershed at stage i i represents different historical stages i e stage 1 stage 2 and stage 3 we further use the sdr to reflect the characteristics of sediment transport at different stages of the watershed in this study sdr was calculated by the ratio of sediment yield measured by the caoping hydrological station to the soil erosion rate of the watershed in the cbg watershed intense human activities have significantly changed the sdr at different stages the sdr at stage i of the watershed is calculated according to the following equation xu 2003 2 sdr i y i e i 2 3 1 sediment deposition rate previous studies have shown that watersheds on the clp have the following characteristics 1 the channels of all levels of tributaries are cut down to the bedrock 2 floodplain alluvial fan and alluvial fan are not developed 3 the average slope of watershed is greater than 15 in which the slope of the gully is usually greater than 60 4 the sediment is mainly composed of fine particles gong et al 1981 xu 1999 zheng et al 2015b additionally according to the previous long term field observation in watershed scale on the clp jin et al 2002 the sediment deposition of other slope measures i e terrace and restored vegetation was only 2 5 of the total sediment deposition mass which is basically negligible compared with check dams therefore we assume that the sediment deposition occurs only on check dam in this study at stage 1 there were almost no swc measures and no long term sediment deposition in the cbg watershed resulting in the value of d1 being 0 d2 and d3 were estimated based on the sediment deposited behind the check dam we added the sediment volume of small sized and medium sized check dams and key check dams to obtain the total sediment volume of stage 2 and stage 3 of the cbg watershed d2 3 finally in combination with the survey data of the sediment volume of check dams obtained by the local water authorities in 1999 we estimated the total sediment volume and sediment deposition rate at stage 2 d2 and stage 3 d3 respectively 2 3 2 sediment yield the outlet hydrological station records daily suspension load data since the 1950 s it is worth noting that according to our measured data the average percentage of loess particle size 0 25 mm and 0 05 mm in the cbg watershed is 64 4 and 99 1 n 83 respectively fine particles in runoff usually have a slower settling velocity mou and meng 1981 and xu 1999 calculated that almost all the sediment load greater than95 in the cbg watershed is suspended load due to the strong sediment transport capacity of hyperconcentrated flow and the high fine particle content of the loess in the cbg watershed therefore the suspension flux monitored by the hydrologic station at high frequency can be regarded as the total sediment load which is also confirmed by the previous study in the cbg watershed zheng et al 2013 according to the annual sediment load data of different stages we calculated y1 y2 and y3 because of the high sampling and monitoring frequency at the hydrologic station the error of yi is small and can be ignored 2 3 3 soil erosion rate we estimated the ei of the cbg watershed by two different methods to ensure the accuracy of the estimated results of soil erosion rate the first method estimates ei by adding yi and di according to the sediment budget equation 1 this method has been widely used on the chinese loess plateau ran et al 2014 zeng et al 2020a and other regions jordan 2006 the second method estimates ei at the watershed scale by selecting enough representative dam controlled sub watersheds all selected headwater sub watersheds used to estimate the soil erosion rate must meet the following conditions first the check dam in the selected sub watershed is situated in the upstream of the watershed and there are no other check dams in its upstream gully second the check dam has no drainage facilities e g spillway or water release tunnel to ensure that all eroded sediment in the sub watershed is intercepted third the check dam has been in good operation thus far and has not been damaged by any floods fourth the selected sub watershed has a clear history of swc measures and land use change records all the standards are to ensure that the trapping efficiency of the selected check dam can be regarded as 100 in addition there was almost no other long term sediment deposition in the sub watershed except for the check dam therefore the total deposited sediment mass by the check dam is equal to the total eroded sediment mass in these selected sub watersheds through field investigation and interviews with local villagers we selected 34 representative sub watersheds and the corresponding watershed areas ranged from 0 18 to 1 62 km2 fig 1b at stage 1 there was almost no sediment deposition in the cbg watershed so e1 was equal to y1 for e2 and e3 we first estimated the sediment volume of 34 check dams according to the above method then the soil erosion rate for each representative sub watershed was calculated according to the average bulk density watershed area and construction year of check dams among the 34 sub watersheds 26 sub watersheds were built in the 1970 s and can be used to estimate the average erosion rate from 1970 to 2018 e2 3 the remaining 8 sub watersheds were built after 2000 and can be used to estimate e3 2000 2018 finally e2 1970 1999 was estimated by the weighted average method 3 e 2 e 2 3 2018 1970 e 3 2018 2000 1999 1970 2 4 statistical analysis and uncertainty analysis we evaluated the relationship between the silted land area and the sediment volume through nonlinear fitting in microsoft excel 2016 variance analysis was used to compare the differences between the fluxes in different historical stages in spss 25 0 the monte carlo simulation in oracle crystal ball was used to determine the uncertainties in the estimation of the soil erosion rate due to the number of representative dam site samples 3 results 3 1 estimation of the sediment volume of check dams we simulated the sediment deposition process in 37 empty gullies fig 1c the results show that for both small sized and medium sized check dams the power function well expressed the relationship between the silted land area and the corresponding sediment volume for small sized check dams with small silted land areas and shallow deposition depths the fitted power function is 4 y 6 05 x 1 42 r 2 0 96 for medium sized check dams the fitted power function is 5 y 3 99 x 1 62 r 2 0 97 where x is the silted land area of the check dam and y is the corresponding sediment volume fig 4 shows that the correlation coefficients of the fitting curves for both small sized and medium sized check dams are quite high r2 0 96 and r2 0 97 the cross section of small sized check dams is usually v shaped and that of medium sized check dams is u shaped fig 4c therefore with the same silted land area the deposition depth and corresponding sediment volume in small sized check dams are larger than those in medium sized check dams fig 4 in contrast with the same deposition depth the silted land area and corresponding sediment volume in medium sized check dams are more than twice those in small sized check dams fig 4a b 3 2 silted land area sediment volume and deposition rate a total of 245 check dams were evenly distributed in the cbg watershed of which the numbers of small sized medium sized and key check dams were 187 47 and 11 accounting for 76 19 and 4 of the total number of check dams respectively fig 5 a through the fitting curve of the silted land area and sediment volume we calculated the sediment volume of each check dam coupled with the official storage data of key check dams the total sediment volume behind check dams in the cbg watershed was estimated to be 32 9 million m3 the sediment volumes of small sized medium sized and key check dams were 8 4 16 1 and 8 4 million m3 accounting for approximately 26 49 and 26 of the total sediment volume of the cbg watershed respectively fig 5b according to the average bulk density and the survey data of 1999 we estimated that the total sediment mass at stage 2 and stage 3 of the cbg watershed was 33 6 and 9 2 million t respectively the corresponding sediment deposition rate for stage 2 d2 and stage 3 d3 are 5 989 and 2 582 351 t km 2 yr 1 respectively 3 3 sediment yield and soil erosion rate from 1960 to 2018 the annual sediment load of the cbg watershed fluctuated obviously and showed a significant downward trend p 0 01 at stage 1 and stage 2 the annual sediment load was significantly positively correlated with the annual precipitation p 0 01 large annual precipitation often leads to high annual sediment load such as in 1961 1966 1969 1978 and 1994 at stage 3 the annual precipitation shows an increasing trend p 0 01 but the annual sediment load decreased compared with the early stage fig 6 the total sediment yield of the three stages were 39 6 41 8 and 7 3 million t and the corresponding sediment yields were 21 144 7 452 and 2 086 t km 2 yr 1 respectively fig 6 compared with stage 1 the sediment yields at stage 2 and stage 3 decreased by 65 and 91 respectively according to the sediment yield data of stage 1 the value of e1 was 21 144 t km 2 yr 1 e2 and e3 were estimated by the soil erosion rate of 34 representative sub watersheds table 1 and table 2 for the check dam built in the 1970 s sw 1 to sw 26 the soil erosion rate was 10 282 2 143 t km 2 yr 1 e2 3 for the check dam built after 2000 sw 27 to sw 34 the soil erosion rate was 4 723 1 278 t km 2 yr 1 e3 e2 was estimated to be 13 819 3 622 t km 2 yr 1 based on the weighted average method which is consistent with other research results in the cbg watershed jiao et al 1992 from stage 1 to stage 3 the soil erosion rate of the cbg watershed decreased significantly and e2 and e3 decreased by 38 and 67 respectively compared with e1 the ei estimated by the sediment budget equation was consistent with that estimated by the representative sub watershed table 3 3 4 sediment budget and sediment delivery ratio at stage 1 no swc measures were planned in the cbg watershed resulting in the output of all eroded sediment from the watershed table 4 the sdr of this stage was close to 1 which is consistent with the sdr value in the wuding river watershed in the same period zheng et al 2015b at stage 2 numerous check dams were built in the cbg watershed which intercepted the eroded sediment and reduced sediment transport downstream resulting in a significant reduction in the sdr to 0 57 table 4 at stage 3 the damage to check dams led to a decrease in the sediment deposition rate meanwhile vegetation restoration significantly reduced the soil erosion rate resulting in a further reduction in the sdr to 0 45 table 4 4 discussion 4 1 estimation of soil erosion rate of watershed accurate estimation of the watershed soil erosion rate is a prerequisite for further determining the sdr many studies have used erosion models such as the revised universal soil loss equation rusle to estimate the soil erosion rate borrelli et al 2017 however the assignment of the various factors of the rusle model in different regions is still not well systematically evaluated additionally the rusle model has poor applicability in small watersheds especially when gully erosion is involved liu et al 2020a other studies obtain more accurate soil erosion rate estimates through the analysis of runoff plot observation data however its value can only reflect sheet erosion in a certain area and not complex gully erosion in a watershed moreover the measurement of runoff plots requires considerable manpower and material resources which are limited to a few areas cerdan et al 2010 fang et al 2017 in contrast measuring sediment behind check dam in headwater sub watersheds is considered as an effective method for estimating soil erosion rate in ungauged watersheds fang et al 2019 zhao et al 2017 especially on the clp where more than 50 000 check dams are distributed the biggest limitation of this method is the accurate estimation of the sediment retained behind check dams which significantly affects the estimation of soil erosion rate in the watershed our recent research has proposed a method to estimate the sediment volume of check dams based on uav photogrammetry which is more accurate and convenient than traditional topographic and geometric methods zeng et al 2022 in this study we further extend the application of this method and combine this method with the check dam in headwater sub watersheds to estimate soil erosion rate at watershed scale firstly the soil erosion rate estimated by this method includes sheet erosion and gully erosion because the check dam intercepts all the erosion sediment from slope land and gullies in the watershed fang et al 2019 secondly on the basis of accurately obtaining the sediment volume of check dam the soil erosion rate of watershed can be quickly estimated by easily obtained parameters such as watershed area silted land area and construction year of check dam finally this method is widely applicable on the clp and can be applied to different geographical division and spatial scales we further applied the sediment budget equation to estimate the soil erosion rate of the cbg watershed the sediment budget equation method has been widely used on the clp because it is easy to obtain accurate sediment output flux from hydrological stations at the watershed outlet shao et al 2015 when the sediment deposition rate of the watershed is accurately quantified this method can predict the soil erosion rate with high accuracy lemma et al 2020 noticeably the two different methods show similar estimation results table 3 and the estimated results are comparable to the soil erosion rates at watershed scale on the chinese loess plateau in the same period in other literatures jiang et al 1990 jiao et al 1992 wei et al 2018 which also corroborates the accuracy of our estimation methods 4 2 effects of check dams and vegetation restoration on sediment delivery processes during the period of extensive agriculture without swc stage 1 it is widely accepted that the annual sdr of watersheds on the clp approximates 1 xu 1999 zheng et al 2015b serious soil erosion and high sdr at this stage lead to a large amount of sediment output from the watershed fig 7 silting the river channel lifting the riverbed and causing flooding wu et al 2008 with large scale check dams construction at stage 2 check dams play an active role in controlling gully erosion by reducing gully slopes stabilizing gully beds and weakening erosion kinetic energy wang et al 2021 xu et al 2004 additionally check dams construction in gullies reduces the connectivity between hillsides and watershed outlets resulting in an inefficient transport system and weak sediment connectivity cucchiaro et al 2019 porto et al 2018 thereby significantly altering the sediment deposition process at the watershed lu et al 2012 check dams reduce the soil erosion rate and increase the sediment deposition rate of the watershed so that the sediment yield at stage 2 is only 35 of stage 1 in the cbg watershed fig 7 with the implementation of ggp stage 3 the vegetation cover of the cbg watershed increased from 42 in 1999 to 74 in 2017 zeng et al 2020a in this stage the soil erosion rate of the watershed was further reduced to 22 of that at stage 1 vegetation restoration shows a stronger ability to reduce erosion especially sheet erosion zhang et al 2021 have shown that land use change dominates the reduction of soil erosion on the clp especially the transformation from cropland to grasslands and forests when vegetation coverage reaches 60 soil erosion can be greatly minimized liu et al 2020c a large area of vegetation can significantly reduce surface runoff through canopy interception and increased soil infiltration ran et al 2013 wang et al 2018b additionally vegetation restoration can improve the stability of soil aggregates and soil erosion resistance and further reduce soil erosion wang et al 2018b it is worth noting that the annual precipitation of stage 3 in the cbg watershed has a significant upward trend fig 6 even so under the synergistic action of check dams and vegetation restoration the sediment yield of cbg watershed is still further reduced to 2086 t km 2 yr 1 which is only 10 of the sediment yield at stage 1 wang et al 2015 analyzed sediment load data of the yellow river in the past 60 years and pointed out that check dams and vegetation restoration were the primary factors driving 90 reduction of sediment yield in the yellow river in the past few decades large scale swc measures have substantially altered the sediment delivery processes zeng et al 2020b check dams and vegetation restoration have significantly affected the sdr of the watershed the sdr of the study watershed decreased from 1 at stage 1 to 0 57 at stage 2 and 0 45 at stage 3 continual construction of check dams was the primary reason for the reduced sdr during the period from 1970 to 1999 while vegetation restoration became the main influencing factor for the reduction in the sdr after 2000 this is consistent with the conclusion of previous studies on the clp li et al 2019 pal et al 2018 wang et al 2015 4 3 implications china is still ambitious to strengthen swc on the clp to ensure regional ecological restoration and high quality economic development li et al 2021 ndrc 2010 under such circumstances it is critical to accurately estimate the current soil erosion rate on the clp and further clarify the influence of swc measures on the sediment delivery processes from a more dynamic perspective we extend the application of our previous research zeng et al 2022 and combine it with check dam constructed in headwater watershed to propose a method to estimate the soil erosion and deposition rate at watershed scale there are 56 065 check dams on the clp and more than 56 161 new check dams are planned in the future ndrc 2010 therefore it is easy to find the check dams suitable for estimating the soil erosion rate of the watershed which makes this method have the potential to evaluate soil erosion rates in different regions on the clp additionally we found that compared with the agricultural activity stage without swc measures check dams and vegetation restoration reduced watershed sediment yield by 90 through affecting soil erosion and sediment deposition considering that some studies have recently shown that vegetation restoration on the clp reaches the threshold feng et al 2016 and further vegetation restoration will lead to the soil dry layer wang et al 2011 and affect regional water resources cao et al 2011 therefore the key to achieving real soil and water conservation on the clp is to maintain the current achievements of vegetation restoration and build more new check dams check dams are also widely distributed in global arid and semi arid regions such as spain australia india iran and ethiopia abedini et al 2012 lucas borja et al 2021 our method provides the possibility for the estimation of soil erosion rate on the decadal scale in watershed without long term hydrological monitoring additionally like the clp many countries or regions suffering from serious soil erosion are committed to controlling soil erosion improving land productivity and promoting quality of life through swc and ecological restoration abbasi et al 2019 for these countries or regions with ambitious targets our study clarifies and quantified how swc measures such as check dams and vegetation restoration affect soil erosion and sediment delivery processes and provides references for future swc planning 5 conclusion in this study methods based on uav photogrammetry and check dam surveying were first used to quantify soil erosion and sediment deposition within a hilly and gully watershed then in combination with multiyear monitoring data of sediment yield we estimated the sdr at different historical stages of the watershed the results show that the soil erosion rate of stage 2 1970 1999 check dam construction stage and stage 3 2000 2018 vegetation restoration stage was 38 and 67 lower than that of stage 1 1960 1969 extensive agriculture stage additionally check dams act as sediment sink areas at stage 2 and stage 3 intercepting 43 and 55 of the eroded sediment in the study watershed respectively check dam construction and vegetation restoration significantly affected the sdr of the cbg watershed the sdr decreased from 1 at stage 1 to 0 57 at stage 2 and 0 45 at stage 3 construction of check dams has resulted in the reduction in the sdr in the watershed from 1970 to 1999 while vegetation restoration became the main influencing factor for the reduction of sdr after 2000 china will further strengthen swc projects on the clp in the coming decades which will lead to further changes in sediment delivery in the yellow river basin our study will help to clarify the changes in sediment delivery in the yellow river and its influencing factors under the new ecological context and will provide a reference for further

2577,china has implemented a series of ambitious soil and water conservation swc projects on the chinese loess plateau which have significantly changed the erosion transport and deposition of sediment as a result the sediment flux of the yellow river once the largest carrier of fluvial sediment worldwide has been reduced by approximately 85 in the past 60 years however the effects of swc measures on erosion transport and deposition of sediment are still difficult to quantify which greatly limits the further planning and adjustment of swc measures here we determined soil erosion sediment deposition and sediment yield at different historical stages in a 187 km2 hilly and gully watershed on the chinese loess plateau using the unmanned aerial vehicle uav photogrammetry technology combined with check dam surveying and hydrologic monitoring the results show that the construction of check dams and vegetation restoration significantly reduced the soil erosion rate from 21 144 t km 2 yr 1 at stage 1 1960 1969 to 13 819 3 622 t km 2 yr 1 at stage 2 1970 1999 and further to 4 723 1 278 t km 2 yr 1 at stage 3 2000 2018 the sediment deposition rate was estimated to be 5 989 and 2 582 351 t km 2 yr 1 at stage 2 and stage 3 respectively the variation in the erosion and deposition of sediment led to a significant change in the sediment delivery ratio from 1 at stage 1 to 0 57 at stage 2 and 0 45 at stage 3 our research results provide an important reference for further swc planning keywords sediment delivery ratio soil erosion chinese loess plateau sediment yield check dam unmanned aerial vehicle data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction accelerated soil erosion is one of the most important environmental problems worldwide and is usually accompanied by nonpoint source pollution and land degradation alewell et al 2020 borrelli et al 2017 lal 2017 the process of soil erosion involves soil detachment in the source area sediment deposition in the sink area and sediment transport in fluvial channels doetterl et al 2016 nearing et al 2017 understanding the linkage of different erosion processes and quantifying their fluxes are essential for predicting sediment yield based on local soil erosion rates evaluating the transport of nutrients and pollutants and estimating field land degradation rates nowak and schneider 2017 overeem et al 2017 systematic understanding of the subprocesses of soil erosion has always been a challenge in the field the concept of the sediment delivery ratio sdr connects on site soil erosion and off site sediment yield within a watershed walling 1983 the sdr is defined as the ratio of the measured sediment flux transport through a certain section of the river to the total amount of eroded sediment in a watershed above the section which reflects the ability of water flow to transport eroded sediment walling 1983 the sdr is an effective research tool worldwide to systematically evaluate the regional and watershed scale soil erosion process for example lal 2003 estimated that the total amount of global annual eroded sediment is about 75 billion t based on global river sediment flux and compiled large scale river sdr data rajbanshi and bhattacharya 2020 combined the revised universal soil loss equation rusle model and sdr to evaluate soil erosion and specific sediment yield at watershed scale and determined that topographic factors and mean annual precipitation are the most important factors affecting soil erosion and sediment yield accurate quantification of sediment delivery processes within a watershed lays the foundation for elucidating the changes in erosion deposition and output in the sdr the sediment yield of a watershed can be obtained through the high frequency monitoring of researchers or hydrological stations with high accuracy mao et al 2009 in contrast it has always been difficult to accurately estimate the soil erosion at watershed scale plot observations soil erosion models and isotope tracing methods are usually employed to construct the soil erosion rate boix fayos et al 2006 porto et al 2018 rajbanshi and bhattacharya 2020 however these methods are either labour consuming and material intensive or are associated with unignorable calculation errors and are limited to a few watersheds brown et al 2009 the sediment deposition process at watershed scale usually includes the sediment interception of dam vegetation and terrace or the local deposits of floodplain alluvial fan and alluvial fan which is difficult to measure and simulate xu 2003 therefore sediment deposition rate is usually obtained by subtracting sediment yield from soil erosion rate at watershed scale and its accuracy will be affected by the estimation errors of sediment yield and soil erosion rate swarnkar et al 2018 zhou et al 2019 that is a considerable number of sediment delivery studies regard the deposition process as a black box garcia ruiz et al 2015 walling 1983 overall there are still great challenges in the quantification of soil erosion and sediment deposition on watershed scale which brings great uncertainty to quantifying the change of sediment delivery in complex erosion process the chinese loess plateau clp is the most seriously eroded region worldwide with an annual soil erosion rate of more than 5000 t km 2 zhao et al 2013 the extremely high soil erosion rate is accompanied by tremendously high sediment flux into the bohai sea with an average of approximately 1 6 billion t yr 1 from 1919 to 1960 wu et al 2008 large amounts of sediment delivered to the river have blocked the channels and reservoirs raised the riverbed and further caused flooding posing a serious threat to the people downstream ben slimane et al 2015 wang et al 2017 under this background many studies on the sdr have been carried out on the clp to deeply understand the mechanism of sediment delivery and to further control soil erosion fang et al 2008 wang et al 2018a gong and xiong 1981 indicated that the sdr at the watershed scale of the clp is approximately 1 by analysing measured data at hydrological stations from 1959 to 1969 in both small and large watersheds zheng et al 2014 revealed that the sdr remained stable values ranging from 1 1 to 1 3 during extreme flood events by analysing data measured at plot and watershed scales during the period from 1959 to 1969 these studies have determined the sdr at watershed scale in the period when swc projects are not carried out on the clp and have been widely recognized and applied however numerous check dams were built on different levels of gullies or rivers on the clp to intercept eroded sediment from 1970 to the 2000 s jin et al 2012 by 2011 56 065 check dams in good operation on the clp intercepted 5 7 billion m3 of sediment cmwr 2013 additionally the grain for green program ggp has been carried out on the clp since 1999 which is the largest ever vegetation restoration program worldwide the primary objective of the ggp is to restore steep slopes greater than 25 to grassland or forest which significantly increased the vegetation coverage of the clp from 31 6 in 1999 to 59 6 in 2013 chen et al 2015 check dams and vegetation restoration have greatly changed the sediment delivery processes at watershed scale zhou et al 2019 leading to the change of sdr at watershed scale from close to 1 no swc period to an unknown value however due to the complex effects of check dams and vegetation restoration on erosion transport and deposition process it is still difficult to quantify sdr at watershed scale in the context of current ecological restoration given that changes in the sediment delivery processes will significantly affect water sediment regulation swc planning and the regional ecological environment wang et al 2015 it is crucial to assess and quantify the impact of swc measures on sediment delivery processes check dam constructed in a headwater watershed can intercept all eroded sediment including suspended load and bed load fang et al 2019 as a consequence the sediment trapped by a check dam in a headwater watershed can be utilized to quantify the soil erosion rate and all sediment behind all the check dams within a watershed can be used to calculate the deposition rate wei et al 2018 recently the unmanned aerial vehicle uav photogrammetry technology has been widely used to estimate the storage capacity in deposition areas worldwide because of the advantages of simple operation low cost and high precision alfonso torreno et al 2019 huang et al 2021 rodrigues et al 2021 in combination with check dam surveying and uav photogrammetry techniques we analysed and quantified the sediment delivery processes within a hilly and gully watershed on the clp the objectives of our study are 1 to accurately estimate the soil erosion rate and sediment deposition rate at watershed scale combined with the uav photogrammetry method 2 to determine the sediment budget and sdr at different historical stages and 3 to clarify the effects of check dams and vegetation restoration on the sediment delivery processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the 187 km2 chabagou cbg watershed 109 47 18 to 110 02 22 e 37 38 09 to 37 47 37 n is located in zizhou county shaanxi province and is a third order tributary of the yellow river fig 1 a the cbg watershed has a dry continental climate with an average annual precipitation of 414 mm precipitation mainly occurs in the wet season july to september resulting in approximately 62 runoff and approximately 90 sediment concentration in this period yu et al 2014 from 1960 to 1969 hereinafter abbreviated as stage 1 due to food shortages almost all areas 80 in the cbg watershed were extensively cultivated except for the areas that were too steep zheng et al 2015a this has led to serious soil erosion in the cbg watershed with a maximum annual sediment yield exceeding 70 000 t km 2 to control severe soil erosion a series of swc measures have been carried out in the cbg watershed since the 1970 s fig 2 from 1970 to 1999 stage 2 with the improvement of check dam construction technology many check dams were built to reduce soil erosion fig 1c the dam body material of these check dams is mainly composed of loess mud and the height of the dam body ranges from 10 m to 40 m these check dams intercept a large amount of eroded sediment forming silted land that can be planted fig 2a 2b after 2000 stage 3 the construction of new check dams greatly slowed and the strategy was revised to maintain and reinforce existing check dams guo et al 2021 meanwhile large scale vegetation restoration was carried out in the cbg watershed and a large area of cropland was converted into grassland or forest by 2017 there were 139 km2 of grassland and forest in the cbg watershed approximately 74 of the watershed area zeng et al 2020a a national basic hydrological station was set up at the outlet of the watershed recording daily runoff and sediment data since the 1950 s all sampling and measuring procedures follow the chinese national standards code for liquid flow measurement in open channels gb50179 2015 code for measurement of suspended load in open channels gb 50159 2015 the hydrological station is equipped with 13 weather stations evenly distributed in the cbg watershed which provide the multi year precipitation data of the watershed additionally the local water authorities conducted a detailed survey on check dams in the cbg watershed in 1999 this survey contents include the number sediment volume and construction year of the check dams check dams are usually built by local water authorities or village level administrative units with detailed written records therefore the number and the construction year of the check dams in the survey report have high credibility in contrast due to the limitation of sediment volume estimation method the credibility of sediment volume data of check dams is low 2 2 sediment volume estimation of check dams based on uav photogrammetry due to the complexity of gully morphology and the inaccessibility of historical topographical data the true sediment volume retained by check dams is very difficult to estimate our recent research has established a method for estimating the sediment volume of check dams based on uav photogrammetry zeng et al 2022 here we apply this method to estimate the sediment volume of check dam in the cbg watershed and further invert the soil erosion rate and sediment deposition rate at watershed scale in section 2 3 the basic idea of this method is that due to similar geological structure climate and hydrological characteristics the gully shape usually shows topographic similarity on a local such as small watershed scale liu et al 2020b veneziano and niemann 2000 therefore the empty gullies without check dam can be used to simulate the 3 d topography of real check dam which has not been buried by sediment this method involves four steps 1 obtaining high resolution digital elevation model dem of the selected empty gullies 2 simulating the construction of check dams in empty gullies 3 simulating the sediment deposition process in empty gullies and quantifying key topographic parameters and 4 fitting and estimating the sediment deposition behind check dams fig 3 according to the following principles 37 suitable empty gullies were selected fig 1c 1 these empty gullies are evenly distributed in or near the cbg watershed and have similar topography and landforms 2 these empty gullies are distributed in the watershed with check dam distribution to ensure that these simulated empty gullies were comparable to the actual check dams from september 2020 to may 2021 we used a dji phantom 4 rtk uav to obtain images of these empty gullies through several preflights we set the flying altitude heading phase and side phase overlap parameters at 100 m 80 and 70 respectively to ensure the best shooting effect we used agisoft photoscan professional 1 2 6 to perform the uav imagery and obtained the dem of these empty gullies with a resolution of 0 12 0 24 m then we imported these high resolution dem data into arcgis 10 5 software and added the check dam raster layers converted from vector layers at the appropriate location usually the outlet of a gully to simulated the construction of check dams in these empty gullies next we used the fill a lake tool in the hydrologic modelling of qgis software to simulate the siltation process of check dams in the selected empty gullies to obtain the submerged area silted land area and submerged volume sediment volume corresponding to different submerged depths we then fit the silted land area sediment volume curve area volume relationships of small silted land area is 0 2 hm2 and medium sized silted land area is 2 7 hm2 check dams according to multiple sets of silted land area and the corresponding sediment volume the check dams are classified according to regulation of techniques for comprehensive control of soil erosion technique for erosion control of gullies gbt16453 3 1996 zeng et al 2022 based on the above area volume relationships we only need to obtain the silted land area of each check dam to accurately estimate the sediment volume of check dams we first obtained the high resolution images of the cbg watershed in may 2018 plowing period from google earth which has the most easily identified outline features of the silted land of check dams then the silted land of all check dams in the cbg watershed was extracted based on visual interpretation to improve the accuracy of silted land area we combine color shape texture as well as expert knowledge to visually interpret the silted land in google earth yang and lu 2014 due to the significant difference between the silted land and the surrounding landscape the error caused by manual boundary extraction can be ignored supplementary fig s1 for small sized and medium sized check dams we substituted the extracted silted land area into the above fitting formula to calculate the corresponding sediment volume key check dams or large sized check dams are usually built by water authorities with detailed original topographic data and reservoir capacity curve information recorded for key check dams we obtained the sediment volume from official data more detailed description and accuracy verification of this sediment volume estimation method for check dam can be found in zeng et al 2022 2 3 sediment budget at watershed scale soil erosion at the watershed scale usually includes soil detachment in eroded source areas transportation in gullies or rivers and deposition in sink areas doetterl et al 2016 the corresponding sediment budget is described as follows ran et al 2014 zeng et al 2020a 1 e i y i d i where e i y i and d i represent the respective soil erosion rate sediment yield and sediment deposition rate of the watershed at stage i i represents different historical stages i e stage 1 stage 2 and stage 3 we further use the sdr to reflect the characteristics of sediment transport at different stages of the watershed in this study sdr was calculated by the ratio of sediment yield measured by the caoping hydrological station to the soil erosion rate of the watershed in the cbg watershed intense human activities have significantly changed the sdr at different stages the sdr at stage i of the watershed is calculated according to the following equation xu 2003 2 sdr i y i e i 2 3 1 sediment deposition rate previous studies have shown that watersheds on the clp have the following characteristics 1 the channels of all levels of tributaries are cut down to the bedrock 2 floodplain alluvial fan and alluvial fan are not developed 3 the average slope of watershed is greater than 15 in which the slope of the gully is usually greater than 60 4 the sediment is mainly composed of fine particles gong et al 1981 xu 1999 zheng et al 2015b additionally according to the previous long term field observation in watershed scale on the clp jin et al 2002 the sediment deposition of other slope measures i e terrace and restored vegetation was only 2 5 of the total sediment deposition mass which is basically negligible compared with check dams therefore we assume that the sediment deposition occurs only on check dam in this study at stage 1 there were almost no swc measures and no long term sediment deposition in the cbg watershed resulting in the value of d1 being 0 d2 and d3 were estimated based on the sediment deposited behind the check dam we added the sediment volume of small sized and medium sized check dams and key check dams to obtain the total sediment volume of stage 2 and stage 3 of the cbg watershed d2 3 finally in combination with the survey data of the sediment volume of check dams obtained by the local water authorities in 1999 we estimated the total sediment volume and sediment deposition rate at stage 2 d2 and stage 3 d3 respectively 2 3 2 sediment yield the outlet hydrological station records daily suspension load data since the 1950 s it is worth noting that according to our measured data the average percentage of loess particle size 0 25 mm and 0 05 mm in the cbg watershed is 64 4 and 99 1 n 83 respectively fine particles in runoff usually have a slower settling velocity mou and meng 1981 and xu 1999 calculated that almost all the sediment load greater than95 in the cbg watershed is suspended load due to the strong sediment transport capacity of hyperconcentrated flow and the high fine particle content of the loess in the cbg watershed therefore the suspension flux monitored by the hydrologic station at high frequency can be regarded as the total sediment load which is also confirmed by the previous study in the cbg watershed zheng et al 2013 according to the annual sediment load data of different stages we calculated y1 y2 and y3 because of the high sampling and monitoring frequency at the hydrologic station the error of yi is small and can be ignored 2 3 3 soil erosion rate we estimated the ei of the cbg watershed by two different methods to ensure the accuracy of the estimated results of soil erosion rate the first method estimates ei by adding yi and di according to the sediment budget equation 1 this method has been widely used on the chinese loess plateau ran et al 2014 zeng et al 2020a and other regions jordan 2006 the second method estimates ei at the watershed scale by selecting enough representative dam controlled sub watersheds all selected headwater sub watersheds used to estimate the soil erosion rate must meet the following conditions first the check dam in the selected sub watershed is situated in the upstream of the watershed and there are no other check dams in its upstream gully second the check dam has no drainage facilities e g spillway or water release tunnel to ensure that all eroded sediment in the sub watershed is intercepted third the check dam has been in good operation thus far and has not been damaged by any floods fourth the selected sub watershed has a clear history of swc measures and land use change records all the standards are to ensure that the trapping efficiency of the selected check dam can be regarded as 100 in addition there was almost no other long term sediment deposition in the sub watershed except for the check dam therefore the total deposited sediment mass by the check dam is equal to the total eroded sediment mass in these selected sub watersheds through field investigation and interviews with local villagers we selected 34 representative sub watersheds and the corresponding watershed areas ranged from 0 18 to 1 62 km2 fig 1b at stage 1 there was almost no sediment deposition in the cbg watershed so e1 was equal to y1 for e2 and e3 we first estimated the sediment volume of 34 check dams according to the above method then the soil erosion rate for each representative sub watershed was calculated according to the average bulk density watershed area and construction year of check dams among the 34 sub watersheds 26 sub watersheds were built in the 1970 s and can be used to estimate the average erosion rate from 1970 to 2018 e2 3 the remaining 8 sub watersheds were built after 2000 and can be used to estimate e3 2000 2018 finally e2 1970 1999 was estimated by the weighted average method 3 e 2 e 2 3 2018 1970 e 3 2018 2000 1999 1970 2 4 statistical analysis and uncertainty analysis we evaluated the relationship between the silted land area and the sediment volume through nonlinear fitting in microsoft excel 2016 variance analysis was used to compare the differences between the fluxes in different historical stages in spss 25 0 the monte carlo simulation in oracle crystal ball was used to determine the uncertainties in the estimation of the soil erosion rate due to the number of representative dam site samples 3 results 3 1 estimation of the sediment volume of check dams we simulated the sediment deposition process in 37 empty gullies fig 1c the results show that for both small sized and medium sized check dams the power function well expressed the relationship between the silted land area and the corresponding sediment volume for small sized check dams with small silted land areas and shallow deposition depths the fitted power function is 4 y 6 05 x 1 42 r 2 0 96 for medium sized check dams the fitted power function is 5 y 3 99 x 1 62 r 2 0 97 where x is the silted land area of the check dam and y is the corresponding sediment volume fig 4 shows that the correlation coefficients of the fitting curves for both small sized and medium sized check dams are quite high r2 0 96 and r2 0 97 the cross section of small sized check dams is usually v shaped and that of medium sized check dams is u shaped fig 4c therefore with the same silted land area the deposition depth and corresponding sediment volume in small sized check dams are larger than those in medium sized check dams fig 4 in contrast with the same deposition depth the silted land area and corresponding sediment volume in medium sized check dams are more than twice those in small sized check dams fig 4a b 3 2 silted land area sediment volume and deposition rate a total of 245 check dams were evenly distributed in the cbg watershed of which the numbers of small sized medium sized and key check dams were 187 47 and 11 accounting for 76 19 and 4 of the total number of check dams respectively fig 5 a through the fitting curve of the silted land area and sediment volume we calculated the sediment volume of each check dam coupled with the official storage data of key check dams the total sediment volume behind check dams in the cbg watershed was estimated to be 32 9 million m3 the sediment volumes of small sized medium sized and key check dams were 8 4 16 1 and 8 4 million m3 accounting for approximately 26 49 and 26 of the total sediment volume of the cbg watershed respectively fig 5b according to the average bulk density and the survey data of 1999 we estimated that the total sediment mass at stage 2 and stage 3 of the cbg watershed was 33 6 and 9 2 million t respectively the corresponding sediment deposition rate for stage 2 d2 and stage 3 d3 are 5 989 and 2 582 351 t km 2 yr 1 respectively 3 3 sediment yield and soil erosion rate from 1960 to 2018 the annual sediment load of the cbg watershed fluctuated obviously and showed a significant downward trend p 0 01 at stage 1 and stage 2 the annual sediment load was significantly positively correlated with the annual precipitation p 0 01 large annual precipitation often leads to high annual sediment load such as in 1961 1966 1969 1978 and 1994 at stage 3 the annual precipitation shows an increasing trend p 0 01 but the annual sediment load decreased compared with the early stage fig 6 the total sediment yield of the three stages were 39 6 41 8 and 7 3 million t and the corresponding sediment yields were 21 144 7 452 and 2 086 t km 2 yr 1 respectively fig 6 compared with stage 1 the sediment yields at stage 2 and stage 3 decreased by 65 and 91 respectively according to the sediment yield data of stage 1 the value of e1 was 21 144 t km 2 yr 1 e2 and e3 were estimated by the soil erosion rate of 34 representative sub watersheds table 1 and table 2 for the check dam built in the 1970 s sw 1 to sw 26 the soil erosion rate was 10 282 2 143 t km 2 yr 1 e2 3 for the check dam built after 2000 sw 27 to sw 34 the soil erosion rate was 4 723 1 278 t km 2 yr 1 e3 e2 was estimated to be 13 819 3 622 t km 2 yr 1 based on the weighted average method which is consistent with other research results in the cbg watershed jiao et al 1992 from stage 1 to stage 3 the soil erosion rate of the cbg watershed decreased significantly and e2 and e3 decreased by 38 and 67 respectively compared with e1 the ei estimated by the sediment budget equation was consistent with that estimated by the representative sub watershed table 3 3 4 sediment budget and sediment delivery ratio at stage 1 no swc measures were planned in the cbg watershed resulting in the output of all eroded sediment from the watershed table 4 the sdr of this stage was close to 1 which is consistent with the sdr value in the wuding river watershed in the same period zheng et al 2015b at stage 2 numerous check dams were built in the cbg watershed which intercepted the eroded sediment and reduced sediment transport downstream resulting in a significant reduction in the sdr to 0 57 table 4 at stage 3 the damage to check dams led to a decrease in the sediment deposition rate meanwhile vegetation restoration significantly reduced the soil erosion rate resulting in a further reduction in the sdr to 0 45 table 4 4 discussion 4 1 estimation of soil erosion rate of watershed accurate estimation of the watershed soil erosion rate is a prerequisite for further determining the sdr many studies have used erosion models such as the revised universal soil loss equation rusle to estimate the soil erosion rate borrelli et al 2017 however the assignment of the various factors of the rusle model in different regions is still not well systematically evaluated additionally the rusle model has poor applicability in small watersheds especially when gully erosion is involved liu et al 2020a other studies obtain more accurate soil erosion rate estimates through the analysis of runoff plot observation data however its value can only reflect sheet erosion in a certain area and not complex gully erosion in a watershed moreover the measurement of runoff plots requires considerable manpower and material resources which are limited to a few areas cerdan et al 2010 fang et al 2017 in contrast measuring sediment behind check dam in headwater sub watersheds is considered as an effective method for estimating soil erosion rate in ungauged watersheds fang et al 2019 zhao et al 2017 especially on the clp where more than 50 000 check dams are distributed the biggest limitation of this method is the accurate estimation of the sediment retained behind check dams which significantly affects the estimation of soil erosion rate in the watershed our recent research has proposed a method to estimate the sediment volume of check dams based on uav photogrammetry which is more accurate and convenient than traditional topographic and geometric methods zeng et al 2022 in this study we further extend the application of this method and combine this method with the check dam in headwater sub watersheds to estimate soil erosion rate at watershed scale firstly the soil erosion rate estimated by this method includes sheet erosion and gully erosion because the check dam intercepts all the erosion sediment from slope land and gullies in the watershed fang et al 2019 secondly on the basis of accurately obtaining the sediment volume of check dam the soil erosion rate of watershed can be quickly estimated by easily obtained parameters such as watershed area silted land area and construction year of check dam finally this method is widely applicable on the clp and can be applied to different geographical division and spatial scales we further applied the sediment budget equation to estimate the soil erosion rate of the cbg watershed the sediment budget equation method has been widely used on the clp because it is easy to obtain accurate sediment output flux from hydrological stations at the watershed outlet shao et al 2015 when the sediment deposition rate of the watershed is accurately quantified this method can predict the soil erosion rate with high accuracy lemma et al 2020 noticeably the two different methods show similar estimation results table 3 and the estimated results are comparable to the soil erosion rates at watershed scale on the chinese loess plateau in the same period in other literatures jiang et al 1990 jiao et al 1992 wei et al 2018 which also corroborates the accuracy of our estimation methods 4 2 effects of check dams and vegetation restoration on sediment delivery processes during the period of extensive agriculture without swc stage 1 it is widely accepted that the annual sdr of watersheds on the clp approximates 1 xu 1999 zheng et al 2015b serious soil erosion and high sdr at this stage lead to a large amount of sediment output from the watershed fig 7 silting the river channel lifting the riverbed and causing flooding wu et al 2008 with large scale check dams construction at stage 2 check dams play an active role in controlling gully erosion by reducing gully slopes stabilizing gully beds and weakening erosion kinetic energy wang et al 2021 xu et al 2004 additionally check dams construction in gullies reduces the connectivity between hillsides and watershed outlets resulting in an inefficient transport system and weak sediment connectivity cucchiaro et al 2019 porto et al 2018 thereby significantly altering the sediment deposition process at the watershed lu et al 2012 check dams reduce the soil erosion rate and increase the sediment deposition rate of the watershed so that the sediment yield at stage 2 is only 35 of stage 1 in the cbg watershed fig 7 with the implementation of ggp stage 3 the vegetation cover of the cbg watershed increased from 42 in 1999 to 74 in 2017 zeng et al 2020a in this stage the soil erosion rate of the watershed was further reduced to 22 of that at stage 1 vegetation restoration shows a stronger ability to reduce erosion especially sheet erosion zhang et al 2021 have shown that land use change dominates the reduction of soil erosion on the clp especially the transformation from cropland to grasslands and forests when vegetation coverage reaches 60 soil erosion can be greatly minimized liu et al 2020c a large area of vegetation can significantly reduce surface runoff through canopy interception and increased soil infiltration ran et al 2013 wang et al 2018b additionally vegetation restoration can improve the stability of soil aggregates and soil erosion resistance and further reduce soil erosion wang et al 2018b it is worth noting that the annual precipitation of stage 3 in the cbg watershed has a significant upward trend fig 6 even so under the synergistic action of check dams and vegetation restoration the sediment yield of cbg watershed is still further reduced to 2086 t km 2 yr 1 which is only 10 of the sediment yield at stage 1 wang et al 2015 analyzed sediment load data of the yellow river in the past 60 years and pointed out that check dams and vegetation restoration were the primary factors driving 90 reduction of sediment yield in the yellow river in the past few decades large scale swc measures have substantially altered the sediment delivery processes zeng et al 2020b check dams and vegetation restoration have significantly affected the sdr of the watershed the sdr of the study watershed decreased from 1 at stage 1 to 0 57 at stage 2 and 0 45 at stage 3 continual construction of check dams was the primary reason for the reduced sdr during the period from 1970 to 1999 while vegetation restoration became the main influencing factor for the reduction in the sdr after 2000 this is consistent with the conclusion of previous studies on the clp li et al 2019 pal et al 2018 wang et al 2015 4 3 implications china is still ambitious to strengthen swc on the clp to ensure regional ecological restoration and high quality economic development li et al 2021 ndrc 2010 under such circumstances it is critical to accurately estimate the current soil erosion rate on the clp and further clarify the influence of swc measures on the sediment delivery processes from a more dynamic perspective we extend the application of our previous research zeng et al 2022 and combine it with check dam constructed in headwater watershed to propose a method to estimate the soil erosion and deposition rate at watershed scale there are 56 065 check dams on the clp and more than 56 161 new check dams are planned in the future ndrc 2010 therefore it is easy to find the check dams suitable for estimating the soil erosion rate of the watershed which makes this method have the potential to evaluate soil erosion rates in different regions on the clp additionally we found that compared with the agricultural activity stage without swc measures check dams and vegetation restoration reduced watershed sediment yield by 90 through affecting soil erosion and sediment deposition considering that some studies have recently shown that vegetation restoration on the clp reaches the threshold feng et al 2016 and further vegetation restoration will lead to the soil dry layer wang et al 2011 and affect regional water resources cao et al 2011 therefore the key to achieving real soil and water conservation on the clp is to maintain the current achievements of vegetation restoration and build more new check dams check dams are also widely distributed in global arid and semi arid regions such as spain australia india iran and ethiopia abedini et al 2012 lucas borja et al 2021 our method provides the possibility for the estimation of soil erosion rate on the decadal scale in watershed without long term hydrological monitoring additionally like the clp many countries or regions suffering from serious soil erosion are committed to controlling soil erosion improving land productivity and promoting quality of life through swc and ecological restoration abbasi et al 2019 for these countries or regions with ambitious targets our study clarifies and quantified how swc measures such as check dams and vegetation restoration affect soil erosion and sediment delivery processes and provides references for future swc planning 5 conclusion in this study methods based on uav photogrammetry and check dam surveying were first used to quantify soil erosion and sediment deposition within a hilly and gully watershed then in combination with multiyear monitoring data of sediment yield we estimated the sdr at different historical stages of the watershed the results show that the soil erosion rate of stage 2 1970 1999 check dam construction stage and stage 3 2000 2018 vegetation restoration stage was 38 and 67 lower than that of stage 1 1960 1969 extensive agriculture stage additionally check dams act as sediment sink areas at stage 2 and stage 3 intercepting 43 and 55 of the eroded sediment in the study watershed respectively check dam construction and vegetation restoration significantly affected the sdr of the cbg watershed the sdr decreased from 1 at stage 1 to 0 57 at stage 2 and 0 45 at stage 3 construction of check dams has resulted in the reduction in the sdr in the watershed from 1970 to 1999 while vegetation restoration became the main influencing factor for the reduction of sdr after 2000 china will further strengthen swc projects on the clp in the coming decades which will lead to further changes in sediment delivery in the yellow river basin our study will help to clarify the changes in sediment delivery in the yellow river and its influencing factors under the new ecological context and will provide a reference for further

2578,mountain snowpack is an important water resource in high altitude and latitude regions where terrain is typically complex however only limited information has been published on snowmelt pathways in such regions and their de facto contributions to streamflow and soil moisture to fill this knowledge gap this study integrated a snowmelt pathway tracking algorithm to the high resolution physically based distributed hydrology soil vegetation model dhsvm to track snowmelt movement and to quantify snowmelt contributions during surface hydrologic processes a simple reservoir operation scheme was also integrated into the model the modified model was applied to a dammed mesoscale watershed in the northeastern region of the tibetan plateau china to explore relevant snow and reservoir effects results show that both the annual snow contribution to soil moisture sc sm and the snow contribution to streamflow sc s significantly decreased between 1965 and 2019 on a monthly scale sc sm amplitudes were highest in the upper soil layer while peaks in deeper layers lagged behind those in upper layers moreover mean monthly sc s from all stations revealed bimodal distributions that corresponded to the snowfall season finally reservoir regulation measures only exerted minimal impacts 2 0 on sc s if current climate change rates continue on the same trajectory mountain snowpack reductions will be the primary cause for decreases in monthly and annual streamflow at the outlet of this basin to mitigate climate change impacts better water resource management is needed in this watershed keywords dhsvm snowmelt pathway tracking algorithm snow contribution streamflow reservoir regulation tibetan plateau data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction snow is an important component of global energy and water cycles especially in high altitude and latitude regions pradhanang et al 2011 bormann et al 2018 you et al 2020 adhikari et al 2020 ehsani et al 2021 song et al 2021 ehsani and behrangi 2022 its impacts on soil freezing and thawing cycles hydrological processes vegetation phenology irrigation and hydropower generation are significant due to its unique characteristics i e high albedo and low thermal conductivity zhang 2005 wang et al 2013 dietz et al 2015 bormann et al 2018 qin et al 2020 livneh and badger 2020 because snow accumulates during the cold season and melts during the warm season mountain snowpack behaves like a natural water reservoir providing potable water to approximately one sixth of the world s population barnett et al 2005 barnhart et al 2016 climate warming has altered mountain snowpack accumulation and melting dynamics this has been confirmed through changes in melt volume and timing globally including the tibetan plateau xu et al 2017 wang et al 2017 the western united states adam et al 2009 li et al 2017 spain morán tejeda et al 2014 and northwestern canada kang et al 2016 accurate assessments of changes in snow and associated impacts on water cycles are of great importance for water resource management in high altitude and latitude mountainous watersheds to assess impacts of snowpack change on water resources many previous studies based their findings on indirect measurements observed in the field such as the ratio of snowfall or the snow water equivalent swe to precipitation serreze et al 1999 zhang et al 2015 although such metrics provide valuable information on the contribution of snow to total runoff in specific regions these approaches fail to describe physical processes such as how surface snowfall is transformed into channel streamflow serreze et al 1999 li et al 2017 physically based hydrologic models are another method used to assess snowmelt contributions these models can simulate infiltration evapotranspiration percolation and surface and subsurface flow adam et al 2009 pradhanang et al 2011 kapnick and delworth 2013 morán tejeda et al 2014 li et al 2017 li et al 2019 han et al 2019 however most hydrologic models do not account for rainfall and snowmelt pathways in other words most of these models ignore specific routing processes associated with these pathways namely from source runoff generation to basin outlets this information is critical because some of this water may not reach the basin outlet rather it will remain in soil via soil water infiltration and participate in evaporation and groundwater recharge however as a simple solution many studies used indirect metrics based on model simulated snowfall swe snowmelt precipitation and runoff barnett et al 2005 siderius et al 2013 cuo et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 su et al 2016 li et al 2018a mimeau et al 2019 or compared differences among different experiments by switching snowmelt algorithms on and off fang et al 2017 obviously to better understand streamflow components and associated changing effects under a changing environment it is necessary to clarify how temporal streamflow variations affect hydrological processes at a basin scale hence snowmelt pathway tracking is a promising approach that can be used to quantify its contribution to hydrological basin processes weiler et al 2018 mimeau et al 2019 recently a few studies have integrated algorithms that track snowmelt into physically based hydrologic models li et al 2017 li et al 2019 however these models are macroscale based wherein terrestrial surface spatial resolutions are represented at much coarser spatial resolutions one sixteenth at best as hydrologic model performance in mountainous watershed is highly related to the terrain resolution in the model vivoni et al 2005 high resolution models are more appropriate for mountainous watersheds moreover many macroscale hydrological models do not account for water exchange among grid cells as high resolution models do therefore high resolution hydrological models can better account for dynamic surface and subsurface flow movement surface subsurface flow exchange and spatial dynamic snowpack processes in the mountainous watersheds kapnick and delworth 2013 bormann et al 2018 sun et al 2018 hence incorporating snowmelt tracking algorithm into the high resolution models would provide more accurate snowmelt contributions to streamflow snowpack accumulation and melting processes are extremely sensitive to climate conditions most relevant studies only accounted for temperature and precipitation when evaluating climate change impacts on snowpacks morán tejeda et al 2014 grusson et al 2015 wang et al 2017 although other meteorological factors such as wind speed shortwave longwave radiation and atmospheric humidity also play important roles in snowmelt processes they have rarely been considered due to the scarcity of measurements in high mountain areas han et al 2019 shortwave radiation is widely considered as a key factor of snowmelt rates while longwave radiation also significantly influences the energy balance due to its active presence throughout the day particularly during cloudy days and in early spring when shortwave radiation is too weak to cause the onset of snowmelt plüss and ohmura 1997 sicart et al 2006 wind speed and atmospheric humidity are related to thermo aerodynamic conditions mcvicar et al 2012 which have a significant effect on sensible and latent heat flux artificial reservoirs regulate streamflow for a variety of purposes e g water supply irrigation hydropower and flood control which have extensively altered natural riverine regimes by impounding water during rainy seasons and releasing it during dry seasons nilsson et al 2005 chao et al 2008 zhao et al 2016 ehsani et al 2017 however limited reservoir and operation data especially for small and medium sized reservoirs hinder a greater understanding of the effects of reservoir operations under a background of climate change morán tejeda et al 2014 this study developed and integrated a homogeneously mixed tracking hmt method and a simplified reservoir operation scheme to a high resolution distributed hydrologic model this modified model can specifically represent the involvement of snowmelt during all terrestrial based hydrological processes at each timestep thus this integrated model directly accounts for the contribution of snowmelt not only within soil moisture and subsurface flow throughout a basin but also within streamflow at basin outlet and reservoir storage of the basin itself which have seldomly been reported in the literature this improved model was applied to a mesoscale river basin where streamflow is regulated via a large capacity reservoir in the northeastern region of the tibetan plateau china to investigate snowmelt contributions and reservoir regulation effects this study is intended to fill the quantifiable knowledge gap regarding the direct contribution of snowmelt to hydrologic processes while also investigating the synergistic effects of reservoir regulation and snowmelt alterations on streamflow in mountainous watersheds 2 snowmelt tracking algorithm and reservoir regulation scheme 2 1 brief overview of the original dhsvm this study used the physically based dhsvm wigmosta et al 1994 wigmosta et al 2002 to simulate snowpack properties and to track snowmelt pathways associated with hydrologic processes under high temporal and spatial resolutions this model can provide outstanding hydrological simulation performance within complex mountainous terrain beckers et al 2009 having previously been used to investigate various research topics such as urbanization impacts climate change impacts stream temperature and sediment transportation doten et al 2006 cuo et al 2006 cuo et al 2008 cuo et al 2009 cuo et al 2011a elsner et al 2010 sun et al 2015 liu et al 2020 the model accounts for evapotranspiration canopy interception snow accumulation and ablation unsaturated moisture movement subsurface flow and overland flow using a series of mass energy balance equations see supplementary information for further information on the model the current dhsvm version does not explicitly partition snowmelt and rainfall contributions to streamflow and soil moisture accordingly this study specifically developed a hmt method to describe water that derives from snowmelt within terrestrial hydrological processes at each timestep the key assumption of the hmt method is that water that derives from snowmelt and other sources on terrestrial surfaces and in soil layers are both well mixed and are together involved in all hydrologic processes over time details on the hmt algorithm are described below see section 2 2 this study also integrated a simplified reservoir operation scheme to represent flow regulation effects see section 2 3 2 2 snowmelt pathway tracking algorithm 2 2 1 the ratio of soil moisture sm from snow to total sm at time step t when snowmelt occurs in a grid cell it will thoroughly mix with throughfall r t excess rain after canopy interception and with the excess surface water that remains at the end of the previous timestep esw t 1 after which it will infiltrate into the topsoil layer equation 1 expresses the infiltration fraction from snow f snow i t 1 f snow i t s t esw snow t 1 s t r t esw t 1 where st represents snowmelt the subscript snow represents the snowmelt contribution to different variables for all other equations for example esw snow t 1 is the snowmelt contribution to esw t 1 as shown in fig 1 a i 0 t represents the amount of infiltration during a given timestep which is determined by soil moisture and available surface water at the start of a timestep after infiltration the soil moisture fraction from snowmelt f snow sm 1 t in the upper soil layer can be modified as follows 2 f snow sm 1 t smc 1 s n o w t 1 i 0 t f snow i t smc 1 t 1 i 0 t where smc 1 t 1 represents total soil water content in the upper soil layer at the start of timestep t when soil moisture is above the field capacity in the upper soil layer downward unsaturated moisture movement will occur based on darcy s law transporting excess soil moisture from the upper soil layer to the lower soil layer which has been simulated by the dhsvm equation 3 describes the soil moisture fraction from snow in the deeper soil layer after this percolation process 3 f snow sm n t smc n s n o w t 1 i n 1 t f snow sm n 1 t smc n t 1 i n 1 t where subscript n 1 and n represent the n 1 th and n th soil layer respectively besides infiltration and percolation processes soil moisture content in each soil layer can also be affected by evapotranspiration and saturated subsurface flow here we use i n s n o w t e t n s n o w t and δ sf n s n o w t to represent snowmelt contributions to downward percolation evapotranspiration and subsurface flow at the n th soil layer at time t respectively i n t et n t and δ sf n t are the total amounts of these variables values of n are from 1 surface soil layer to the deepest user defined layer bottom soil layer according to the hmt assumption for snowmelt tracking i n s n o w t e t n s n o w t and δ sf n s n o w t can be calculated as follows 4 i n s n o w t i n t f snow sm n t 5 et n s n o w t et n t f snow sm n t 6 δ sf n s n o w t δ sf n t f snow sf t where f snow sf t in equation 6 is the proportion of snow derived water in subsurface flow and is described in section 2 2 2 at the end of time step t after considering infiltration percolation subsurface flow and evapotranspiration final update of snowmelt contribution to each soil layer can be written as equation 7 with n 1 2 7 f snow sm n t smc n s n o w t 1 i n 1 t f snow sm n 1 t i n s n o w t et n s n o w t δ sf n s n o w t smc n t 1 i n 1 t i n t e t n t δ sf n t 2 2 2 the ratio of saturated subsurface flow sf from snow to total sf saturated subsurface flow is the water flow within the saturated soil layer when the groundwater table is near to the surface a grid cell can exchange water with its eight adjacent neighbors depending on elevation here we assumed that soil moisture greater than field capacity was evenly mixed when soil layers was below the water table in this case the proportion of snow derived water in subsurface flow is shown as follows 8 f snow sf t smc i t smc i f c f snow sm i t k 1 8 sf k s n o w t smc i t smc i f c k 1 8 sf k t where subscript i represents soil layers below the groundwater table smc i f c denotes the soil moisture content at field capacity in the i th soil layer k 1 8 sf k t is the sum of subsurface flow received from its eight k 1 8 adjacent neighbors at timestep t sf k s n o w t is snow contribution to sf k t and can be represented as sf k t f snow sf k t where f snow sf k t is the ratio of snow contribution to sf in the k th adjacent cell 2 2 3 the ratio of surface runoff sr from snow to total sr the dhsvm can generate surface runoff in three different ways infiltration excess runoff saturation excess runoff and return flow from the subsurface equation 8 can be used to compute the snowmelt fraction in subsurface water which may either become saturated overland flow or return flow to the surface equation 1 is used to calculate snow related infiltration excess and saturation excess runoff thus equation 9 represents the contribution of snowmelt to total surface runoff from different sources 9 f snow sr t sw t f snow i t sfr t f snow sf t k 1 8 sr k s n o w t sw t sfr t k 1 8 sr k t where sw t s t r t esw t 1 i 0 t represents excess water after infiltration when any of the first three variables is greater than 0 while i 0 t is 0 it means that surface water will occur on a grid cell that is already saturated sfr t represents subsurface flow discharge during a timestep k 1 8 sr k t represents the sum of surface runoff that derives from the eight k 1 8 adjacent neighbors of a targeted cell at timestep t the calculation of sr k s n o w t is written as sr k t f snow sr k t and f snow sr k t is the ratio of snow contribution to sr in the k th adjacent cell 2 2 4 the ratio of evapotranspiration et from snow to total et in a grid cell evapotranspiration derives from three different sources overstory vegetation understory vegetation and the surface soil layer soil evaporation only occurs in the surface soil layer when understory or snowpack do not occur in the dhsvm and equation 2 can be used to calculate the snowmelt fraction of this layer both overstory and understory vegetation can remove water from one or more soil layers through transpiration evaporation from canopy interception can also occur in wet overstory and understory vegetation which the dhsvm can simulate thus the proportion of water that derives from snow via vegetation evapotranspiration is determined by both soil moisture components and canopy interception the snow fraction that contributes to total evapotranspiration is calculated as follows 10 f snow et t t i t f snow sm i t e s t f snow sm 1 t e v t t i t e s t e v t represents vegetation evaporation from rainfall interception during timestep t t i t represents the amount of vegetation transpiration extracted from the i th soil layer which has the same snow fraction as the i th soil layer e s t represents soil evaporation in the surface soil layer 2 2 5 the ratio of streamflow from snow to total streamflow fig 1b shows the precipitation surface runoff and subsurface flow intercepted by channels in the formation of streamflow for streamflow in individual channel segments its snow contribution equation 11 is quantitatively determined by snowmelt derived water in inflow surface runoff subsurface flow as well as its initial storage state 11 f snow flow t sr t f snow sr t sf t f snow sf t if snow t f l o w snow t 1 cw t sr t sf t i f t f l o w t 1 where cw t sr t sf t and if t represent channel water surface runoff subsurface flow and inflow from one or more upper channel segments respectively flow t 1 represents the initial water storage in this segment because channel water derives solely from rainfall snowmelt has no contributing role 2 3 reservoir operation scheme zhao et al 2016 integrated a multi purpose reservoir regulation scheme into the dhsvm that incorporates a set of conditional rules this scheme allocates water release based on downstream water demand when levels of reservoir water are between an inactive pool and conservation pool state however not all reservoirs release water based on downstream water demand which are due to specific reasons e g if a reservoir is part of a massive and incomplete project within a particular region the safety of daily operations is the sole concern to investigate how reservoir operations regulate and affect streamflow patterns under a background of changing climate conditions and safety dominant regulation operations this study added a multiple linear regression reservoir regulation algorithm to the dhsvm 12 q out t a 1 q in t a 2 s t a 3 where qin t and qout t represent reservoir inflow and outflow at timestep t respectively st denotes reservoir storage coefficients a1 a2 and a3 are for inflow storage and y intercept respectively this simplified scheme can be more widely used as reservoir inflow and outflow data are routinely measured and easier to access compared to downstream multisource water demand data from socioeconomic sectors the modified model also tracks snowmelt contributions to reservoir water storage at any given timestep equation 11 is used to calculate snowmelt contributions to q in t inflow is added to existing reservoir water storage first denominator and inflow derived snowmelt is combined with stored snowmelt nominator the contribution of the snow fraction to reservoir water storage f snow rws t at timestep t can be described as follows 13 f snow rws t ri snow t r w s snow t 1 ri t r w s t 1 where ri and rws represent reservoir inflow and reservoir water storage unit mm respectively this fractional value also applies to the evaporation rate and outflow given that both directly relate to well mixed reservoir storage water the total water storage and snowmelt that derives from stored water is then modified by subtracting losses from evaporation ret and outflow rot and this final state equation 14 will be the initial condition for the next timestep 14 f snow rws t ri snow t r w s snow t 1 f snow rws t re t ro t ri t r w s t 1 re t ro t 3 model application a case study 3 1 study area the beichuan river basin brb is in the northeastern region of the tibetan plateau its water source originates from the southern slopes of the qilian mountains the total basin area is 2800 km2 and its elevation ranges from 2400 m to 4800 m fig 2 this basin is one of the two main sources of the huangshui river an important tributary of the yellow river known as the mother river of china influenced by the east asian monsoon plateau monsoons and westerlies the climate of the brb is warm and wet in summer and cold and dry in winter zhang et al 2016 the annual mean temperature of the basin area is approximately 2 8 c while annual total precipitation is approximately 530 mm liu et al 2020 the upper reaches of the brb have been designated a national natural reserve of china with only limited anthropic activities rendering it an ideal natural laboratory for the study of climate change related issues fig 2 designated by the area outlined in red the heiquan reservoir is below the national natural reserve with a 1 82 108 m3 water storage capacity which commenced operation in 2001 to provide water to downstream areas it supplies 1 35 108 m3 of water to xining the largest city on the tibetan plateau with a population greater than two million that resides along the corridor connecting the brb and xining it also provides water for irrigation to downstream agricultural fields which is the primary crop production area in qinghai province as part of a local and incomplete water transport project the safety of the heiquan reservoir is the sole concern of its current daily operation moreover reservoir outflow is always greater than demand although the brb is a mesoscale watershed its elevation range is representative of the general terrain of the pan third pole region playing host to the headwaters of many large river systems such as the yellow river yangtze river mekong river etc moreover the snow depth climatology of the basin is also representative of the eastern tibetan plateau region xu et al 2017 therefore understanding the contribution of snow at monthly and interannual scales in this complex alpine watershed may also represent other areas within the expansive tibetan plateau region 3 2 data 3 2 1 model input data model forcing data includes precipitation air temperature relative humidity wind speed incoming shortwave and longwave radiation table 1 lists detailed information of the observed data within the brb and its closest vicinity there are two meteorological stations menyuan my datong dt four hydrological stations niuchang nc heilin hl xiamen xm and qiaotou qt and one automatic weather station hereafter referred to as bk aws fig 2 all missing data were filled and extended to fit the whole study period inverse distance weighted idw was used to interpolate wind speed and idw was adjusted to the temperature lapse rate to interpolate temperature this study estimated missing precipitation data using the linear monthly precipitation relationships between the two nearest stations during overlapping periods relative humidity and incoming shortwave longwave radiation from all stations were generated based on field observations and the method used for interpolation is provided in supplementary information daily data were then disaggregated into 3 hour model forcing data using the method described by nijssen et al 2001 assuming that wind speed and precipitation were uniformly distributed throughout a day whereas energy related forcing followed the diurnal solar cycle spatially varied model input data included terrain soil type and depth and vegetation types were used for representative spatial watershed characteristics shuttle radar topographic mission srtm data https srtm csi cgiar org srtmdata were used as digital terrain data in this study which could then generate flow direction and river networks of the basin the brb soil class map was extracted from the harmonized world soil database hwsd land use cover data derived from the resource and environment data cloud platform 3 2 2 observations for model calibration and validation in this study we evaluated streamflow and snowpack distribution as listed in table 1 observed streamflow data were collected from the qinghai bureau of hydrology and water resources survey qbhwrs streamflow data from the nc hydrological station were calibrated throughout 2002 2019 given the limited anthropogenic activities above this station accordingly this data provides a good representation of natural streamflow conditions streamflow at both xm 1966 1975 and hl 1980 1988 were used for validation streamflow at qt was not used in our evaluation due to the relatively intense anthropogenic activities associated with the hydrological processes between the xm and qt hydrological stations liu et al 2020 to evaluate snowpack our study used snow cover remote sensing data 2003 2014 derived from hao et al 2018 which combines moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis snow cover and interactive multisensor snow ims products to generate a cloud free snow cover product with a 500 m spatial resolution downloaded from the national tibetan plateau data center https data tpdc ac cn in the dhsvm snow cover occurs in a grid cell when the swe is greater than zero thus the area of snow cover is the ratio of snow covered area to the entire basin area reservoir data i e inflow outflow water storage and water level obtained from the qbhwrs table 1 were also used to calibrate the reservoir regulation scheme soil moisture was measured at the bk aws station while data from the summer months of 2018 2019 were used to evaluate soil moisture 3 2 3 model implementation this study used an approximate 60 year historical simulation period 1960 2019 the first 5 years i e 1960 1964 were used as the spin up period while the actual analysis was conducted from 1965 to 2019 the dhsvm has a spatial resolution of 100 m new parameters i e initial snow rain contribution to streamflow and soil moisture in all soil layers were added to our modified model these initial state values were set after the spin up period i e the first 5 years as a comparison to historical simulations this study also conducted future simulations under a background of climate change given the large climate projection uncertainty and the coarse spatial resolution of earth system models esm barnett et al 2005 su et al 2016 as well as the relatively small study area used in this study historical trends from 1960 to 2019 were used to generate future climate forcings in the basin based on results of r s rescale range analysis method not shown it was estimated that historical trends of climate elements would be likely to continue to the future in most cases especially for temperature thus this study assumed that trends would persist into the future supplementary information lists the equations used to calculate future climate inputs including temperature precipitation and wind speed future relative humidity and incoming shortwave longwave radiation were then calculated based on their relationships with future temperatures using these equations for the future scenario 2020 2024 was used as the spin up period and 2025 2079 was used for our analysis the modified model was evaluated through calibration and validation in this study we used nash sutcliffe efficiency e ns the ratio of root mean square error rmse to standard deviation of the observation rsr and the relative error e r to assess model performance e ns compares residual variance to observed data variance which has been widely used to evaluate the fitness of a hydrograph rsr standardizes rmse incorporating an error index and a normalization factor e r measures average simulation to observational trends as recommended by moriasi et al 2007 all three quantitative statistic types were used in this study to evaluate the model 4 results 4 1 calibration and validation results table 2 lists the values of the most sensitive parameters in the dhsvm according to cuo et al 2011b and sun et al 2019 other parameter values were set to default values table 3 and fig 3 provide model simulation and validation results including snow cover area sca as well as streamflow and reservoir related flow fig 3a shows that the model can clearly capture intra annual timings of snow accumulation and ablation as well as peaks and troughs monthly values of ens 0 56 rsr 0 67 and er 10 were acceptable as shown in table 3 streamflow simulations at the nc xm and hl hydrological stations during various periods are shown in table 3 and fig 3b d their daily and monthly ens values were all greater than 0 54 and 0 78 respectively where the nc hydrological station yielded the highest ens value 0 85 which is located within the national natural reserve daily and monthly rsr values from all stations were no higher than 0 68 and 0 46 and their er values were 7 table 3 and fig 3e h provide reservoir calibration results daily and monthly reservoir inflow e ns values were as high as 0 80 and 0 89 respectively whereas the corresponding er value was 12 72 resulting in cascading effects of reservoir storage water level and outflow underestimations even so er values of these reservoir variables were all below 15 and their e ns and rsr values were considered reasonable this indicated that the new simplified reservoir scheme reflected actual current reservoir operations additionally this study used its own observed soil moisture data 10 cm from the bk aws station obtained during the summer months throughout 2018 2019 to evaluate simulated soil moisture fig s1 in supplementary information results indicated that simulated values were close to observed values er 3 and the correlation coefficient between them was significant p 0 01 during the thawing period when hydrological processes are very active 4 2 snow cover area variation throughout the historical period simulated annual spatial averages and trends of sca in the brb are shown in fig 4 a throughout 1965 2019 sca decreased significantly p 0 05 where 1998 was determined to be the point of abrupt change based on mann kendall test results data not shown at a monthly scale sca variability had an approximate u shape where march yielded the highest value followed by november all months exhibited a downward trend where the largest decreases occurred in february march and november which mostly exceeded a significance level of 0 05 fig 4b this study used four climate scenarios s1 s4 to determine the specific factors that resulted in a decrease in snow table 4 historical climate conditions were those observed between 1965 and 2019 and detrended climate factors observed in monthly temperature precipitation and wind speed were removed from long term trends at all stations while maintaining their interannual variability as an example fig 5 shows historical and detrended time series at the dt meteorological station other forcing factors such as relative humidity and incoming shortwave longwave radiation can be subsequently updated based on equations s1 s4 in supplementary information comparisons between paired scenarios s2 and s1 s3 and s1 and s4 and s1 showed the impact of temperature precipitation and wind speed change on sca respectively furthermore fig 6 shows the influence of temperature precipitation and wind speed on relative changes in monthly and annual sca in comparison to the baseline scenario this figure also shows that temperature was an overriding factor during all months wind speed ranked second from december to may but precipitation overrode wind speed from june to november changes in temperature and precipitation resulted in negative sca changes at an annual scale whereas changes in wind speed resulted in a positive sca change this can be explained by means of their trends snow melts faster under higher temperatures resulting in a decrease in snow accumulation and hence a reduction in sca despite the increasing annual precipitation observed at most stations see fig 5 cold season precipitation slightly decreased especially in october 0 043 mm a 1 and november 0 037 mm a 1 shown by the bar graphs in fig 5 resulting in a decrease in sca wind speed is associated with aerodynamics and hence available energy for snowmelt to occur for example wind causes advected sensible heat flux and changes the vapor pressure deficit through turbulent eddies facilitating snowmelt and sublimation decreasing wind speeds increase aerodynamic resistance which subsequently weakens sensible and latent heat flux and hence the energy required for snowmelt to occur 4 3 snow contribution to soil moisture sc sm fig 7 shows temporal patterns in sc sm at a 10 40 and 80 cm soil depth it is clear that the annual mean sc sm ratio of each soil layer decreased significantly while that of the 10 cm soil layer decreased the most and that of the 80 cm soil layer decreased the least mann kendall test results showed that points of abrupt change occurred in 2000 2005 and 2006 in the 10 40 and 80 cm soil layers data not shown respectively which lagged behind the abrupt changes in sca that occurred in 1998 at a monthly scale the amplitude of fluctuation and the earlier peak values in the upper soil layer were significantly higher than the deeper soil layers fig 7b the highest sc sm values were in may 19 12 june 14 96 and july 14 76 in the 10 40 and 80 cm soil layers respectively the lowest sc sm value in the 10 cm soil layer occurred in september 8 86 but the lowest values in the 40 and 80 cm soil layers could continue for several months this was due to a decrease in rainfall and snowmelt and low soil moisture during the winter which subsequently led to negligible vertical water movement among the different soil layers moreover this stable state persisted longer in deeper soil layers compared to the upper soil layer for example this stable state persisted in the 10 40 and 80 cm soil layers from november february october march and september april respectively 4 4 snow contribution to streamflow sc s fig 8 shows annual and monthly sc s at all four hydrologic stations all stations experienced obvious decreases over the past 55 years fig 8a generally means and slopes of sc s in downstream areas were lower than upstream areas the slope at the outlet i e the qt hydrological station was 0 112 a 1 at a monthly scale two peaks were observed being similar to the sca pattern where march april yielded the highest values followed by october fig 8b valleys in sc s occurred in july or august corresponding to the lowest yearly sca to determine the source of sc s fig 9 shows lateral inflow and associated components including channel rainfall surface flow and subsurface flow intercepted by channels monthly maximum and minimum lateral inflow values were 40 64 and 7 85 m3 s in september and february respectively fig 9a surface flow was the major component which accounted for 72 67 91 19 of streamflow and this was followed by subsurface flow the channel rainfall amount only accounted for 6 fig 9b the snow contribution to surface streamflow sc sr was further explored as shown in fig 9c the curve in monthly sc sr was roughly m shaped comparing monthly sc sr to the snowmelt ratio i e the ratio of snowmelt to the sum of snowmelt and rainfall and soil average sc sm ratio data not shown showed that sc sr was closer to sc sm in november february indicating that surface flow primarily derived from soil water during the dry season in march april and october the snowmelt ratio played a significant role in an increase in sc sr from may september sc sr was between the snowmelt ratio and soil average sc sm curves indicating that surface flow consisted of atmospheric precipitation and subsurface water recharge during the rainy season 4 5 impacts of reservoir regulation fig 10 b compares historical and future streamflow at the outlet with and without reservoir regulations reservoir operations significantly regulated monthly streamflow increasing streamflow during the dry seasons january may and november december while decreasing streamflow during the rainy season june october although reservoir operations significantly affected monthly streamflow they had little effect on sc s namely there was less than a 2 00 difference between the scenarios i e with and without reservoir operations under both historical and future scenarios fig 10c reservoir influence on changes of snow contribution to inflow and to outflow is further analyzed and is shown in fig s2 in supplementary information at an annual scale reservoir regulations only had a trivial impact on streamflow for both the historical and future scenarios in table 5 annual streamflow and sc s under reservoir regulations were slightly lower than that of no reservoir condition with 0 08 m3 s and 0 31 for the historical period 2001 2019 and 0 06 m3 s and 0 22 for the future precipitation is an important factor in heiquan reservoir regulation as the correlation coefficient between precipitation and the difference between annual reservoir outflow and inflow is 0 85 p 0 001 besides streamflow reservoir regulation also had influence on evaporation with about 0 75 mm a increase on average both in the historical and future periods due to expanded water surface in the reservoir table 5 4 6 comparison between historical and future scenarios if current climate change continues in its trajectory as shown in fig 5 the important question to answer will be how snowpack and its associated impact on streamflow will change in the brb fig 10d e shows differences in monthly and annual sca between historical and future scenarios in the future relative monthly changes in sca will decrease ranging from 87 86 and 22 60 fig 10d the largest sca reduction i e 18 99 will occur in november fig 10e the future annual sca value was calculated at only 10 which is about half the historic value as a result annual snowmelt will decrease by 58 26 mm in the future which accounted for 46 54 of the snowmelt in the historical period leading to the reduction in the contributions of snowmelt to the hydrologic processes in the future table 5 for example sc sm at all soil layers and snow contribution to et will reduce by half snowmelt contributions to surface and subsurface runoff will also decrease ultimately resulting in the future sc s decline without reservoir regulations future snowmelt runoff will decrease during all months especially in april which yielded the highest overall decrease i e 11 43 in historical average runoff however rainfall runoff will increase in february march june and august september fig 10b the combined effect of changes to snowmelt runoff and rainfall runoff will result in a decrease in streamflow during most months except for september where a reduction in snowmelt runoff will always take precedence specifically monthly maximum streamflow increased by 2 06 but minimum streamflow decreased by 6 66 in the future scenario where the top three reductions occurred in july 23 40 may 22 03 and april 15 37 see fig 10a of which snowmelt reductions contributed 29 54 41 40 and 74 36 respectively since april may is the sowing and sprouting season which is a critical period for agriculture production a reduction in streamflow and snowmelt contributions during these months should be of great concern to both water resource management and agricultural sectors additionally 91 96 of an 8 41 decrease in the annual streamflow of the future scenario resulted from a decrease in snowpack while 8 04 of the decrease was derived from decreased rainfall runoff following increased evapotranspiration by almost 70 mm and rainfall contribution to soil moisture by about 7 in the future table 5 even though greater precipitation was projected for the future monthly relative change patterns in future and historical streamflow under reservoir regulations were analogous to that without reservoir regulations although the magnitude was slightly smaller under reservoir control fig 10a according to the two dashed lines shown in fig 10b the future scenario under reservoir operations showed a further reduction in streamflow during most months while the highest reduction also occurred in may july and april which is the same as that mentioned above i e without reservoir regulations this implies that a safety dominant regulation operation scheme may not be viable into the future especially during the sowing and sprouting season therefore a new reservoir operation scheme to mitigate climate change impacts is needed if the current trajectory of climate change continues into the future 5 discussion using the dhsvm coupled with a snowmelt tracking method we obtained an average of 15 37 snowmelt contribution to annual streamflow during historical period with combined non reservoir 1965 2000 and reservoir 2001 2019 regulation indicating that precipitation is the dominant contributing factor to annual streamflow to the best of our knowledge there exists no available field data that can be used to directly evaluate the snowmelt contribution in the brb in this study we referenced studies in the literature that broached on issues related to snowmelt contributions at locations near to our study area for example tan et al 2012 collected water samples from the huangshui river and determined that its oxygen isotope concentration was very close to that of precipitation in the qilian mountains where the huangshui river originates indicating that precipitation is the major source in this river system however due to limited snow samples their study was not able to quantify precipitation and snowmelt contributions to river runoff considering that the heihe river also originates from the qilian mountains and has similar climatic and topographic conditions to that of the brb isotopic tracing results to partition river flow components from the heihe river can be used as a reference using oxygen 18 zhang et al 2009 concluded that snowmelt accounted for 19 8 of total streamflow and its monthly contribution to heihe river discharge ranged between 6 46 and 26 1 in 2000 these findings were similar to the results from our study to compare the sc s from the snowmelt tracking method and an indirect method we calculated snow contribution using the ratio of snowmelt to total streamflow based on model simulations which was 45 16 at the basin outlet being much higher than the tracking snowmelt pathway and oxygen 18 results this indicated estimates from previous studies using indirect measurements to quantify snow contribution to streamflow may be inaccurate the overestimate was because the method failed to account for some of the snowmelt that remained in soil column percolated to deeper layers or involved in evapotranspiration which wouldn t reach the basin outlet for example here the snowmelt tracking approach showed that average sc sm and sc et were about 13 and 10 26 respectively table 5 it is important to note that the hmt method proposed in this study has potential uncertainties which assumes that all water sources such as snowmelt rainfall etc are homogeneously mixed once amassed for example li et al 2017 reported that rainfall during rain on snow events is more likely to form runoff than snowmelt rain on snow events can also accelerate snowmelt wayand et al 2015 given the short time span of this study in measuring irradiance data at only one station bk aws to adjust calculated long term incoming irradiance which is an important driving force for snow hydrology irradiance uncertainty must also be evaluated furthermore certain parameters such as snow albedo sa and rain snow temperature partitioning rstp can also impact snowpack simulations in the dhsvm therefore to analyze snowmelt simulation uncertainties incoming shortwave radiation isr incoming longwave radiation ilr and sa effects which increased decreased by 10 10 as well as changes to temperature thresholds 1 1 c were employed in the dhsvm table 6 provides the uncertainties caused by the above parameters variables to annual snowmelt respective to the level of importance rstp ranked first among the four factors followed by ilr while sa and isr had little impact on annual snowmelt in the dhsvm rstp determines the form of precipitation and ilr plays a key role in snowpack energy and mass dynamics during the early snowmelt season the net radiation at the snow surface will decrease as ilr decreases if net radiation falls below 0 w m2 rainfall will refreeze and release energy to balance this negative net radiation in the dhsvm refrozen water from rainfall is defined as a component of snow accumulation thus the snowpack will increase with a decrease in ilr this snowpack increase will melt away during the warm season leading to an increase in annual snowmelt this process is essentially reversed when ilr increases increased sa had similar effects and processes to that of the decrease ilr unlike persistent influence of rstp in march november both ilr and sa exerted great impacts only in melting and freezing periods especially in april may and september when isr was still low and its average was about 55 90 of ilr meanwhile ilr keeps presence throughout a day but isr only exists in the daytime thus although increased sa and decreased ilr had similar effects the seasonality and diurnal cycle of the radiation components rendered a stronger role of ilr in melting and freezing periods in general reasonable rstp and ilr are crucial for snowmelt simulations sicart et al 2006 sims and liu 2015 given that longwave radiation measurements are sparse and are not routinely measured especially in high altitude regions yang et al 2010 the impact of longwave radiation on snowmelt requires further attention frozen soil is widely distributed throughout the tibetan plateau and it influences surface water and groundwater flow by limiting moisture exchanges between deep ground and the atmosphere decreasing the ability for infiltration while even rechanneling surface water cuo et al 2015 fuss et al 2016 we assumed that this phenomenon is not critical for this study as permafrost soil accounts for 12 15 of the basin as reported by wang 2006 however such a conjecture requires further investigation in the future after the frozen soil algorithm is coupled to the model in addition future climate forcings used in this study are generated based on historical data representing a synthetic future case and thus the future simulation only qualitatively estimates the future changes of hydrological processes in the brb further studies should employ bias correction and downscaling approach to obtain reliable climate projections from multiple earth system models for a range of emission scenarios much like the brb data from meteorological stations have shown that the tibetan plateau is also experiencing a significant temperature increase and a significant wind speed decrease ding et al 2018 li et al 2018b ding et al 2021 according to ma et al 2018 precipitation in most areas of the tibetan plateau decreases in october when snowfall starts to accumulate which is consistent with the precipitation trend that our study observed in october in the brb hence results in this study can be extrapolated to other catchments that share similar climate change and environmental conditions to that of the brb furthermore like what has been reported in the yarlung tsangpo basin in the southern region of the tibetan plateau cuo et al 2019 this study has also showed potential freshwater resource shortages in the future during the sowing and sprouting season in the brb which will be partly due to a reduction in mountain snowpack 6 conclusions as an important natural reservoir mountain snowpacks provide an indispensable water resource to communities and ecosystems globally quantifying snowmelt contributions to streamflow and evaluating impacts of snowpack change on streamflow are essential for regional water resource management and disaster prevention in high altitude and latitude regions however most current studies have partitioned snowmelt contributions to streamflow without considering snowmelt pathways resulting in inaccurate quantification this study integrated a snowmelt pathway tracking algorithm i e homogeneously mixed tracking hmt to the high resolution physically based dhsvm to track snowmelt movement and to quantify snowmelt contributions during surface hydrologic processes a simplified reservoir regulation scheme was also integrated into the model which allowed us to explore the combined effects of snow change and reservoir regulation on streamflow results from this case study are summarized as follows between 1965 and 2019 the brb experienced a significant decrease in annual snow cover area sca and 1998 was determined to be the point of abrupt change temperature was the most significant contributing factor to a decrease in sca i e compared to precipitation and wind speed the degree of variation respective to the snow contribution to soil moisture sc sm was lower in deeper soil layers and their peaks lagged behind the upper layer at a monthly scale annual sc sm in all soil layers experienced a significant decreasing trend with abrupt changes occurring after 2000 similar to monthly sca the monthly snow contribution to streamflow sc s exhibited a bimodal pattern annual sc s at all four hydrologic stations significantly decreased throughout the study period 1965 2019 reservoir operations had little effect 2 on sc s at a monthly scale if current climate conditions continue their trajectory into the future annual sca will decrease and will be the key reason for reductions in annual and monthly streamflow lastly current reservoir regulations will not help prevent this predicted reduction in streamflow especially during the sowing and

2578,mountain snowpack is an important water resource in high altitude and latitude regions where terrain is typically complex however only limited information has been published on snowmelt pathways in such regions and their de facto contributions to streamflow and soil moisture to fill this knowledge gap this study integrated a snowmelt pathway tracking algorithm to the high resolution physically based distributed hydrology soil vegetation model dhsvm to track snowmelt movement and to quantify snowmelt contributions during surface hydrologic processes a simple reservoir operation scheme was also integrated into the model the modified model was applied to a dammed mesoscale watershed in the northeastern region of the tibetan plateau china to explore relevant snow and reservoir effects results show that both the annual snow contribution to soil moisture sc sm and the snow contribution to streamflow sc s significantly decreased between 1965 and 2019 on a monthly scale sc sm amplitudes were highest in the upper soil layer while peaks in deeper layers lagged behind those in upper layers moreover mean monthly sc s from all stations revealed bimodal distributions that corresponded to the snowfall season finally reservoir regulation measures only exerted minimal impacts 2 0 on sc s if current climate change rates continue on the same trajectory mountain snowpack reductions will be the primary cause for decreases in monthly and annual streamflow at the outlet of this basin to mitigate climate change impacts better water resource management is needed in this watershed keywords dhsvm snowmelt pathway tracking algorithm snow contribution streamflow reservoir regulation tibetan plateau data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction snow is an important component of global energy and water cycles especially in high altitude and latitude regions pradhanang et al 2011 bormann et al 2018 you et al 2020 adhikari et al 2020 ehsani et al 2021 song et al 2021 ehsani and behrangi 2022 its impacts on soil freezing and thawing cycles hydrological processes vegetation phenology irrigation and hydropower generation are significant due to its unique characteristics i e high albedo and low thermal conductivity zhang 2005 wang et al 2013 dietz et al 2015 bormann et al 2018 qin et al 2020 livneh and badger 2020 because snow accumulates during the cold season and melts during the warm season mountain snowpack behaves like a natural water reservoir providing potable water to approximately one sixth of the world s population barnett et al 2005 barnhart et al 2016 climate warming has altered mountain snowpack accumulation and melting dynamics this has been confirmed through changes in melt volume and timing globally including the tibetan plateau xu et al 2017 wang et al 2017 the western united states adam et al 2009 li et al 2017 spain morán tejeda et al 2014 and northwestern canada kang et al 2016 accurate assessments of changes in snow and associated impacts on water cycles are of great importance for water resource management in high altitude and latitude mountainous watersheds to assess impacts of snowpack change on water resources many previous studies based their findings on indirect measurements observed in the field such as the ratio of snowfall or the snow water equivalent swe to precipitation serreze et al 1999 zhang et al 2015 although such metrics provide valuable information on the contribution of snow to total runoff in specific regions these approaches fail to describe physical processes such as how surface snowfall is transformed into channel streamflow serreze et al 1999 li et al 2017 physically based hydrologic models are another method used to assess snowmelt contributions these models can simulate infiltration evapotranspiration percolation and surface and subsurface flow adam et al 2009 pradhanang et al 2011 kapnick and delworth 2013 morán tejeda et al 2014 li et al 2017 li et al 2019 han et al 2019 however most hydrologic models do not account for rainfall and snowmelt pathways in other words most of these models ignore specific routing processes associated with these pathways namely from source runoff generation to basin outlets this information is critical because some of this water may not reach the basin outlet rather it will remain in soil via soil water infiltration and participate in evaporation and groundwater recharge however as a simple solution many studies used indirect metrics based on model simulated snowfall swe snowmelt precipitation and runoff barnett et al 2005 siderius et al 2013 cuo et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 su et al 2016 li et al 2018a mimeau et al 2019 or compared differences among different experiments by switching snowmelt algorithms on and off fang et al 2017 obviously to better understand streamflow components and associated changing effects under a changing environment it is necessary to clarify how temporal streamflow variations affect hydrological processes at a basin scale hence snowmelt pathway tracking is a promising approach that can be used to quantify its contribution to hydrological basin processes weiler et al 2018 mimeau et al 2019 recently a few studies have integrated algorithms that track snowmelt into physically based hydrologic models li et al 2017 li et al 2019 however these models are macroscale based wherein terrestrial surface spatial resolutions are represented at much coarser spatial resolutions one sixteenth at best as hydrologic model performance in mountainous watershed is highly related to the terrain resolution in the model vivoni et al 2005 high resolution models are more appropriate for mountainous watersheds moreover many macroscale hydrological models do not account for water exchange among grid cells as high resolution models do therefore high resolution hydrological models can better account for dynamic surface and subsurface flow movement surface subsurface flow exchange and spatial dynamic snowpack processes in the mountainous watersheds kapnick and delworth 2013 bormann et al 2018 sun et al 2018 hence incorporating snowmelt tracking algorithm into the high resolution models would provide more accurate snowmelt contributions to streamflow snowpack accumulation and melting processes are extremely sensitive to climate conditions most relevant studies only accounted for temperature and precipitation when evaluating climate change impacts on snowpacks morán tejeda et al 2014 grusson et al 2015 wang et al 2017 although other meteorological factors such as wind speed shortwave longwave radiation and atmospheric humidity also play important roles in snowmelt processes they have rarely been considered due to the scarcity of measurements in high mountain areas han et al 2019 shortwave radiation is widely considered as a key factor of snowmelt rates while longwave radiation also significantly influences the energy balance due to its active presence throughout the day particularly during cloudy days and in early spring when shortwave radiation is too weak to cause the onset of snowmelt plüss and ohmura 1997 sicart et al 2006 wind speed and atmospheric humidity are related to thermo aerodynamic conditions mcvicar et al 2012 which have a significant effect on sensible and latent heat flux artificial reservoirs regulate streamflow for a variety of purposes e g water supply irrigation hydropower and flood control which have extensively altered natural riverine regimes by impounding water during rainy seasons and releasing it during dry seasons nilsson et al 2005 chao et al 2008 zhao et al 2016 ehsani et al 2017 however limited reservoir and operation data especially for small and medium sized reservoirs hinder a greater understanding of the effects of reservoir operations under a background of climate change morán tejeda et al 2014 this study developed and integrated a homogeneously mixed tracking hmt method and a simplified reservoir operation scheme to a high resolution distributed hydrologic model this modified model can specifically represent the involvement of snowmelt during all terrestrial based hydrological processes at each timestep thus this integrated model directly accounts for the contribution of snowmelt not only within soil moisture and subsurface flow throughout a basin but also within streamflow at basin outlet and reservoir storage of the basin itself which have seldomly been reported in the literature this improved model was applied to a mesoscale river basin where streamflow is regulated via a large capacity reservoir in the northeastern region of the tibetan plateau china to investigate snowmelt contributions and reservoir regulation effects this study is intended to fill the quantifiable knowledge gap regarding the direct contribution of snowmelt to hydrologic processes while also investigating the synergistic effects of reservoir regulation and snowmelt alterations on streamflow in mountainous watersheds 2 snowmelt tracking algorithm and reservoir regulation scheme 2 1 brief overview of the original dhsvm this study used the physically based dhsvm wigmosta et al 1994 wigmosta et al 2002 to simulate snowpack properties and to track snowmelt pathways associated with hydrologic processes under high temporal and spatial resolutions this model can provide outstanding hydrological simulation performance within complex mountainous terrain beckers et al 2009 having previously been used to investigate various research topics such as urbanization impacts climate change impacts stream temperature and sediment transportation doten et al 2006 cuo et al 2006 cuo et al 2008 cuo et al 2009 cuo et al 2011a elsner et al 2010 sun et al 2015 liu et al 2020 the model accounts for evapotranspiration canopy interception snow accumulation and ablation unsaturated moisture movement subsurface flow and overland flow using a series of mass energy balance equations see supplementary information for further information on the model the current dhsvm version does not explicitly partition snowmelt and rainfall contributions to streamflow and soil moisture accordingly this study specifically developed a hmt method to describe water that derives from snowmelt within terrestrial hydrological processes at each timestep the key assumption of the hmt method is that water that derives from snowmelt and other sources on terrestrial surfaces and in soil layers are both well mixed and are together involved in all hydrologic processes over time details on the hmt algorithm are described below see section 2 2 this study also integrated a simplified reservoir operation scheme to represent flow regulation effects see section 2 3 2 2 snowmelt pathway tracking algorithm 2 2 1 the ratio of soil moisture sm from snow to total sm at time step t when snowmelt occurs in a grid cell it will thoroughly mix with throughfall r t excess rain after canopy interception and with the excess surface water that remains at the end of the previous timestep esw t 1 after which it will infiltrate into the topsoil layer equation 1 expresses the infiltration fraction from snow f snow i t 1 f snow i t s t esw snow t 1 s t r t esw t 1 where st represents snowmelt the subscript snow represents the snowmelt contribution to different variables for all other equations for example esw snow t 1 is the snowmelt contribution to esw t 1 as shown in fig 1 a i 0 t represents the amount of infiltration during a given timestep which is determined by soil moisture and available surface water at the start of a timestep after infiltration the soil moisture fraction from snowmelt f snow sm 1 t in the upper soil layer can be modified as follows 2 f snow sm 1 t smc 1 s n o w t 1 i 0 t f snow i t smc 1 t 1 i 0 t where smc 1 t 1 represents total soil water content in the upper soil layer at the start of timestep t when soil moisture is above the field capacity in the upper soil layer downward unsaturated moisture movement will occur based on darcy s law transporting excess soil moisture from the upper soil layer to the lower soil layer which has been simulated by the dhsvm equation 3 describes the soil moisture fraction from snow in the deeper soil layer after this percolation process 3 f snow sm n t smc n s n o w t 1 i n 1 t f snow sm n 1 t smc n t 1 i n 1 t where subscript n 1 and n represent the n 1 th and n th soil layer respectively besides infiltration and percolation processes soil moisture content in each soil layer can also be affected by evapotranspiration and saturated subsurface flow here we use i n s n o w t e t n s n o w t and δ sf n s n o w t to represent snowmelt contributions to downward percolation evapotranspiration and subsurface flow at the n th soil layer at time t respectively i n t et n t and δ sf n t are the total amounts of these variables values of n are from 1 surface soil layer to the deepest user defined layer bottom soil layer according to the hmt assumption for snowmelt tracking i n s n o w t e t n s n o w t and δ sf n s n o w t can be calculated as follows 4 i n s n o w t i n t f snow sm n t 5 et n s n o w t et n t f snow sm n t 6 δ sf n s n o w t δ sf n t f snow sf t where f snow sf t in equation 6 is the proportion of snow derived water in subsurface flow and is described in section 2 2 2 at the end of time step t after considering infiltration percolation subsurface flow and evapotranspiration final update of snowmelt contribution to each soil layer can be written as equation 7 with n 1 2 7 f snow sm n t smc n s n o w t 1 i n 1 t f snow sm n 1 t i n s n o w t et n s n o w t δ sf n s n o w t smc n t 1 i n 1 t i n t e t n t δ sf n t 2 2 2 the ratio of saturated subsurface flow sf from snow to total sf saturated subsurface flow is the water flow within the saturated soil layer when the groundwater table is near to the surface a grid cell can exchange water with its eight adjacent neighbors depending on elevation here we assumed that soil moisture greater than field capacity was evenly mixed when soil layers was below the water table in this case the proportion of snow derived water in subsurface flow is shown as follows 8 f snow sf t smc i t smc i f c f snow sm i t k 1 8 sf k s n o w t smc i t smc i f c k 1 8 sf k t where subscript i represents soil layers below the groundwater table smc i f c denotes the soil moisture content at field capacity in the i th soil layer k 1 8 sf k t is the sum of subsurface flow received from its eight k 1 8 adjacent neighbors at timestep t sf k s n o w t is snow contribution to sf k t and can be represented as sf k t f snow sf k t where f snow sf k t is the ratio of snow contribution to sf in the k th adjacent cell 2 2 3 the ratio of surface runoff sr from snow to total sr the dhsvm can generate surface runoff in three different ways infiltration excess runoff saturation excess runoff and return flow from the subsurface equation 8 can be used to compute the snowmelt fraction in subsurface water which may either become saturated overland flow or return flow to the surface equation 1 is used to calculate snow related infiltration excess and saturation excess runoff thus equation 9 represents the contribution of snowmelt to total surface runoff from different sources 9 f snow sr t sw t f snow i t sfr t f snow sf t k 1 8 sr k s n o w t sw t sfr t k 1 8 sr k t where sw t s t r t esw t 1 i 0 t represents excess water after infiltration when any of the first three variables is greater than 0 while i 0 t is 0 it means that surface water will occur on a grid cell that is already saturated sfr t represents subsurface flow discharge during a timestep k 1 8 sr k t represents the sum of surface runoff that derives from the eight k 1 8 adjacent neighbors of a targeted cell at timestep t the calculation of sr k s n o w t is written as sr k t f snow sr k t and f snow sr k t is the ratio of snow contribution to sr in the k th adjacent cell 2 2 4 the ratio of evapotranspiration et from snow to total et in a grid cell evapotranspiration derives from three different sources overstory vegetation understory vegetation and the surface soil layer soil evaporation only occurs in the surface soil layer when understory or snowpack do not occur in the dhsvm and equation 2 can be used to calculate the snowmelt fraction of this layer both overstory and understory vegetation can remove water from one or more soil layers through transpiration evaporation from canopy interception can also occur in wet overstory and understory vegetation which the dhsvm can simulate thus the proportion of water that derives from snow via vegetation evapotranspiration is determined by both soil moisture components and canopy interception the snow fraction that contributes to total evapotranspiration is calculated as follows 10 f snow et t t i t f snow sm i t e s t f snow sm 1 t e v t t i t e s t e v t represents vegetation evaporation from rainfall interception during timestep t t i t represents the amount of vegetation transpiration extracted from the i th soil layer which has the same snow fraction as the i th soil layer e s t represents soil evaporation in the surface soil layer 2 2 5 the ratio of streamflow from snow to total streamflow fig 1b shows the precipitation surface runoff and subsurface flow intercepted by channels in the formation of streamflow for streamflow in individual channel segments its snow contribution equation 11 is quantitatively determined by snowmelt derived water in inflow surface runoff subsurface flow as well as its initial storage state 11 f snow flow t sr t f snow sr t sf t f snow sf t if snow t f l o w snow t 1 cw t sr t sf t i f t f l o w t 1 where cw t sr t sf t and if t represent channel water surface runoff subsurface flow and inflow from one or more upper channel segments respectively flow t 1 represents the initial water storage in this segment because channel water derives solely from rainfall snowmelt has no contributing role 2 3 reservoir operation scheme zhao et al 2016 integrated a multi purpose reservoir regulation scheme into the dhsvm that incorporates a set of conditional rules this scheme allocates water release based on downstream water demand when levels of reservoir water are between an inactive pool and conservation pool state however not all reservoirs release water based on downstream water demand which are due to specific reasons e g if a reservoir is part of a massive and incomplete project within a particular region the safety of daily operations is the sole concern to investigate how reservoir operations regulate and affect streamflow patterns under a background of changing climate conditions and safety dominant regulation operations this study added a multiple linear regression reservoir regulation algorithm to the dhsvm 12 q out t a 1 q in t a 2 s t a 3 where qin t and qout t represent reservoir inflow and outflow at timestep t respectively st denotes reservoir storage coefficients a1 a2 and a3 are for inflow storage and y intercept respectively this simplified scheme can be more widely used as reservoir inflow and outflow data are routinely measured and easier to access compared to downstream multisource water demand data from socioeconomic sectors the modified model also tracks snowmelt contributions to reservoir water storage at any given timestep equation 11 is used to calculate snowmelt contributions to q in t inflow is added to existing reservoir water storage first denominator and inflow derived snowmelt is combined with stored snowmelt nominator the contribution of the snow fraction to reservoir water storage f snow rws t at timestep t can be described as follows 13 f snow rws t ri snow t r w s snow t 1 ri t r w s t 1 where ri and rws represent reservoir inflow and reservoir water storage unit mm respectively this fractional value also applies to the evaporation rate and outflow given that both directly relate to well mixed reservoir storage water the total water storage and snowmelt that derives from stored water is then modified by subtracting losses from evaporation ret and outflow rot and this final state equation 14 will be the initial condition for the next timestep 14 f snow rws t ri snow t r w s snow t 1 f snow rws t re t ro t ri t r w s t 1 re t ro t 3 model application a case study 3 1 study area the beichuan river basin brb is in the northeastern region of the tibetan plateau its water source originates from the southern slopes of the qilian mountains the total basin area is 2800 km2 and its elevation ranges from 2400 m to 4800 m fig 2 this basin is one of the two main sources of the huangshui river an important tributary of the yellow river known as the mother river of china influenced by the east asian monsoon plateau monsoons and westerlies the climate of the brb is warm and wet in summer and cold and dry in winter zhang et al 2016 the annual mean temperature of the basin area is approximately 2 8 c while annual total precipitation is approximately 530 mm liu et al 2020 the upper reaches of the brb have been designated a national natural reserve of china with only limited anthropic activities rendering it an ideal natural laboratory for the study of climate change related issues fig 2 designated by the area outlined in red the heiquan reservoir is below the national natural reserve with a 1 82 108 m3 water storage capacity which commenced operation in 2001 to provide water to downstream areas it supplies 1 35 108 m3 of water to xining the largest city on the tibetan plateau with a population greater than two million that resides along the corridor connecting the brb and xining it also provides water for irrigation to downstream agricultural fields which is the primary crop production area in qinghai province as part of a local and incomplete water transport project the safety of the heiquan reservoir is the sole concern of its current daily operation moreover reservoir outflow is always greater than demand although the brb is a mesoscale watershed its elevation range is representative of the general terrain of the pan third pole region playing host to the headwaters of many large river systems such as the yellow river yangtze river mekong river etc moreover the snow depth climatology of the basin is also representative of the eastern tibetan plateau region xu et al 2017 therefore understanding the contribution of snow at monthly and interannual scales in this complex alpine watershed may also represent other areas within the expansive tibetan plateau region 3 2 data 3 2 1 model input data model forcing data includes precipitation air temperature relative humidity wind speed incoming shortwave and longwave radiation table 1 lists detailed information of the observed data within the brb and its closest vicinity there are two meteorological stations menyuan my datong dt four hydrological stations niuchang nc heilin hl xiamen xm and qiaotou qt and one automatic weather station hereafter referred to as bk aws fig 2 all missing data were filled and extended to fit the whole study period inverse distance weighted idw was used to interpolate wind speed and idw was adjusted to the temperature lapse rate to interpolate temperature this study estimated missing precipitation data using the linear monthly precipitation relationships between the two nearest stations during overlapping periods relative humidity and incoming shortwave longwave radiation from all stations were generated based on field observations and the method used for interpolation is provided in supplementary information daily data were then disaggregated into 3 hour model forcing data using the method described by nijssen et al 2001 assuming that wind speed and precipitation were uniformly distributed throughout a day whereas energy related forcing followed the diurnal solar cycle spatially varied model input data included terrain soil type and depth and vegetation types were used for representative spatial watershed characteristics shuttle radar topographic mission srtm data https srtm csi cgiar org srtmdata were used as digital terrain data in this study which could then generate flow direction and river networks of the basin the brb soil class map was extracted from the harmonized world soil database hwsd land use cover data derived from the resource and environment data cloud platform 3 2 2 observations for model calibration and validation in this study we evaluated streamflow and snowpack distribution as listed in table 1 observed streamflow data were collected from the qinghai bureau of hydrology and water resources survey qbhwrs streamflow data from the nc hydrological station were calibrated throughout 2002 2019 given the limited anthropogenic activities above this station accordingly this data provides a good representation of natural streamflow conditions streamflow at both xm 1966 1975 and hl 1980 1988 were used for validation streamflow at qt was not used in our evaluation due to the relatively intense anthropogenic activities associated with the hydrological processes between the xm and qt hydrological stations liu et al 2020 to evaluate snowpack our study used snow cover remote sensing data 2003 2014 derived from hao et al 2018 which combines moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis snow cover and interactive multisensor snow ims products to generate a cloud free snow cover product with a 500 m spatial resolution downloaded from the national tibetan plateau data center https data tpdc ac cn in the dhsvm snow cover occurs in a grid cell when the swe is greater than zero thus the area of snow cover is the ratio of snow covered area to the entire basin area reservoir data i e inflow outflow water storage and water level obtained from the qbhwrs table 1 were also used to calibrate the reservoir regulation scheme soil moisture was measured at the bk aws station while data from the summer months of 2018 2019 were used to evaluate soil moisture 3 2 3 model implementation this study used an approximate 60 year historical simulation period 1960 2019 the first 5 years i e 1960 1964 were used as the spin up period while the actual analysis was conducted from 1965 to 2019 the dhsvm has a spatial resolution of 100 m new parameters i e initial snow rain contribution to streamflow and soil moisture in all soil layers were added to our modified model these initial state values were set after the spin up period i e the first 5 years as a comparison to historical simulations this study also conducted future simulations under a background of climate change given the large climate projection uncertainty and the coarse spatial resolution of earth system models esm barnett et al 2005 su et al 2016 as well as the relatively small study area used in this study historical trends from 1960 to 2019 were used to generate future climate forcings in the basin based on results of r s rescale range analysis method not shown it was estimated that historical trends of climate elements would be likely to continue to the future in most cases especially for temperature thus this study assumed that trends would persist into the future supplementary information lists the equations used to calculate future climate inputs including temperature precipitation and wind speed future relative humidity and incoming shortwave longwave radiation were then calculated based on their relationships with future temperatures using these equations for the future scenario 2020 2024 was used as the spin up period and 2025 2079 was used for our analysis the modified model was evaluated through calibration and validation in this study we used nash sutcliffe efficiency e ns the ratio of root mean square error rmse to standard deviation of the observation rsr and the relative error e r to assess model performance e ns compares residual variance to observed data variance which has been widely used to evaluate the fitness of a hydrograph rsr standardizes rmse incorporating an error index and a normalization factor e r measures average simulation to observational trends as recommended by moriasi et al 2007 all three quantitative statistic types were used in this study to evaluate the model 4 results 4 1 calibration and validation results table 2 lists the values of the most sensitive parameters in the dhsvm according to cuo et al 2011b and sun et al 2019 other parameter values were set to default values table 3 and fig 3 provide model simulation and validation results including snow cover area sca as well as streamflow and reservoir related flow fig 3a shows that the model can clearly capture intra annual timings of snow accumulation and ablation as well as peaks and troughs monthly values of ens 0 56 rsr 0 67 and er 10 were acceptable as shown in table 3 streamflow simulations at the nc xm and hl hydrological stations during various periods are shown in table 3 and fig 3b d their daily and monthly ens values were all greater than 0 54 and 0 78 respectively where the nc hydrological station yielded the highest ens value 0 85 which is located within the national natural reserve daily and monthly rsr values from all stations were no higher than 0 68 and 0 46 and their er values were 7 table 3 and fig 3e h provide reservoir calibration results daily and monthly reservoir inflow e ns values were as high as 0 80 and 0 89 respectively whereas the corresponding er value was 12 72 resulting in cascading effects of reservoir storage water level and outflow underestimations even so er values of these reservoir variables were all below 15 and their e ns and rsr values were considered reasonable this indicated that the new simplified reservoir scheme reflected actual current reservoir operations additionally this study used its own observed soil moisture data 10 cm from the bk aws station obtained during the summer months throughout 2018 2019 to evaluate simulated soil moisture fig s1 in supplementary information results indicated that simulated values were close to observed values er 3 and the correlation coefficient between them was significant p 0 01 during the thawing period when hydrological processes are very active 4 2 snow cover area variation throughout the historical period simulated annual spatial averages and trends of sca in the brb are shown in fig 4 a throughout 1965 2019 sca decreased significantly p 0 05 where 1998 was determined to be the point of abrupt change based on mann kendall test results data not shown at a monthly scale sca variability had an approximate u shape where march yielded the highest value followed by november all months exhibited a downward trend where the largest decreases occurred in february march and november which mostly exceeded a significance level of 0 05 fig 4b this study used four climate scenarios s1 s4 to determine the specific factors that resulted in a decrease in snow table 4 historical climate conditions were those observed between 1965 and 2019 and detrended climate factors observed in monthly temperature precipitation and wind speed were removed from long term trends at all stations while maintaining their interannual variability as an example fig 5 shows historical and detrended time series at the dt meteorological station other forcing factors such as relative humidity and incoming shortwave longwave radiation can be subsequently updated based on equations s1 s4 in supplementary information comparisons between paired scenarios s2 and s1 s3 and s1 and s4 and s1 showed the impact of temperature precipitation and wind speed change on sca respectively furthermore fig 6 shows the influence of temperature precipitation and wind speed on relative changes in monthly and annual sca in comparison to the baseline scenario this figure also shows that temperature was an overriding factor during all months wind speed ranked second from december to may but precipitation overrode wind speed from june to november changes in temperature and precipitation resulted in negative sca changes at an annual scale whereas changes in wind speed resulted in a positive sca change this can be explained by means of their trends snow melts faster under higher temperatures resulting in a decrease in snow accumulation and hence a reduction in sca despite the increasing annual precipitation observed at most stations see fig 5 cold season precipitation slightly decreased especially in october 0 043 mm a 1 and november 0 037 mm a 1 shown by the bar graphs in fig 5 resulting in a decrease in sca wind speed is associated with aerodynamics and hence available energy for snowmelt to occur for example wind causes advected sensible heat flux and changes the vapor pressure deficit through turbulent eddies facilitating snowmelt and sublimation decreasing wind speeds increase aerodynamic resistance which subsequently weakens sensible and latent heat flux and hence the energy required for snowmelt to occur 4 3 snow contribution to soil moisture sc sm fig 7 shows temporal patterns in sc sm at a 10 40 and 80 cm soil depth it is clear that the annual mean sc sm ratio of each soil layer decreased significantly while that of the 10 cm soil layer decreased the most and that of the 80 cm soil layer decreased the least mann kendall test results showed that points of abrupt change occurred in 2000 2005 and 2006 in the 10 40 and 80 cm soil layers data not shown respectively which lagged behind the abrupt changes in sca that occurred in 1998 at a monthly scale the amplitude of fluctuation and the earlier peak values in the upper soil layer were significantly higher than the deeper soil layers fig 7b the highest sc sm values were in may 19 12 june 14 96 and july 14 76 in the 10 40 and 80 cm soil layers respectively the lowest sc sm value in the 10 cm soil layer occurred in september 8 86 but the lowest values in the 40 and 80 cm soil layers could continue for several months this was due to a decrease in rainfall and snowmelt and low soil moisture during the winter which subsequently led to negligible vertical water movement among the different soil layers moreover this stable state persisted longer in deeper soil layers compared to the upper soil layer for example this stable state persisted in the 10 40 and 80 cm soil layers from november february october march and september april respectively 4 4 snow contribution to streamflow sc s fig 8 shows annual and monthly sc s at all four hydrologic stations all stations experienced obvious decreases over the past 55 years fig 8a generally means and slopes of sc s in downstream areas were lower than upstream areas the slope at the outlet i e the qt hydrological station was 0 112 a 1 at a monthly scale two peaks were observed being similar to the sca pattern where march april yielded the highest values followed by october fig 8b valleys in sc s occurred in july or august corresponding to the lowest yearly sca to determine the source of sc s fig 9 shows lateral inflow and associated components including channel rainfall surface flow and subsurface flow intercepted by channels monthly maximum and minimum lateral inflow values were 40 64 and 7 85 m3 s in september and february respectively fig 9a surface flow was the major component which accounted for 72 67 91 19 of streamflow and this was followed by subsurface flow the channel rainfall amount only accounted for 6 fig 9b the snow contribution to surface streamflow sc sr was further explored as shown in fig 9c the curve in monthly sc sr was roughly m shaped comparing monthly sc sr to the snowmelt ratio i e the ratio of snowmelt to the sum of snowmelt and rainfall and soil average sc sm ratio data not shown showed that sc sr was closer to sc sm in november february indicating that surface flow primarily derived from soil water during the dry season in march april and october the snowmelt ratio played a significant role in an increase in sc sr from may september sc sr was between the snowmelt ratio and soil average sc sm curves indicating that surface flow consisted of atmospheric precipitation and subsurface water recharge during the rainy season 4 5 impacts of reservoir regulation fig 10 b compares historical and future streamflow at the outlet with and without reservoir regulations reservoir operations significantly regulated monthly streamflow increasing streamflow during the dry seasons january may and november december while decreasing streamflow during the rainy season june october although reservoir operations significantly affected monthly streamflow they had little effect on sc s namely there was less than a 2 00 difference between the scenarios i e with and without reservoir operations under both historical and future scenarios fig 10c reservoir influence on changes of snow contribution to inflow and to outflow is further analyzed and is shown in fig s2 in supplementary information at an annual scale reservoir regulations only had a trivial impact on streamflow for both the historical and future scenarios in table 5 annual streamflow and sc s under reservoir regulations were slightly lower than that of no reservoir condition with 0 08 m3 s and 0 31 for the historical period 2001 2019 and 0 06 m3 s and 0 22 for the future precipitation is an important factor in heiquan reservoir regulation as the correlation coefficient between precipitation and the difference between annual reservoir outflow and inflow is 0 85 p 0 001 besides streamflow reservoir regulation also had influence on evaporation with about 0 75 mm a increase on average both in the historical and future periods due to expanded water surface in the reservoir table 5 4 6 comparison between historical and future scenarios if current climate change continues in its trajectory as shown in fig 5 the important question to answer will be how snowpack and its associated impact on streamflow will change in the brb fig 10d e shows differences in monthly and annual sca between historical and future scenarios in the future relative monthly changes in sca will decrease ranging from 87 86 and 22 60 fig 10d the largest sca reduction i e 18 99 will occur in november fig 10e the future annual sca value was calculated at only 10 which is about half the historic value as a result annual snowmelt will decrease by 58 26 mm in the future which accounted for 46 54 of the snowmelt in the historical period leading to the reduction in the contributions of snowmelt to the hydrologic processes in the future table 5 for example sc sm at all soil layers and snow contribution to et will reduce by half snowmelt contributions to surface and subsurface runoff will also decrease ultimately resulting in the future sc s decline without reservoir regulations future snowmelt runoff will decrease during all months especially in april which yielded the highest overall decrease i e 11 43 in historical average runoff however rainfall runoff will increase in february march june and august september fig 10b the combined effect of changes to snowmelt runoff and rainfall runoff will result in a decrease in streamflow during most months except for september where a reduction in snowmelt runoff will always take precedence specifically monthly maximum streamflow increased by 2 06 but minimum streamflow decreased by 6 66 in the future scenario where the top three reductions occurred in july 23 40 may 22 03 and april 15 37 see fig 10a of which snowmelt reductions contributed 29 54 41 40 and 74 36 respectively since april may is the sowing and sprouting season which is a critical period for agriculture production a reduction in streamflow and snowmelt contributions during these months should be of great concern to both water resource management and agricultural sectors additionally 91 96 of an 8 41 decrease in the annual streamflow of the future scenario resulted from a decrease in snowpack while 8 04 of the decrease was derived from decreased rainfall runoff following increased evapotranspiration by almost 70 mm and rainfall contribution to soil moisture by about 7 in the future table 5 even though greater precipitation was projected for the future monthly relative change patterns in future and historical streamflow under reservoir regulations were analogous to that without reservoir regulations although the magnitude was slightly smaller under reservoir control fig 10a according to the two dashed lines shown in fig 10b the future scenario under reservoir operations showed a further reduction in streamflow during most months while the highest reduction also occurred in may july and april which is the same as that mentioned above i e without reservoir regulations this implies that a safety dominant regulation operation scheme may not be viable into the future especially during the sowing and sprouting season therefore a new reservoir operation scheme to mitigate climate change impacts is needed if the current trajectory of climate change continues into the future 5 discussion using the dhsvm coupled with a snowmelt tracking method we obtained an average of 15 37 snowmelt contribution to annual streamflow during historical period with combined non reservoir 1965 2000 and reservoir 2001 2019 regulation indicating that precipitation is the dominant contributing factor to annual streamflow to the best of our knowledge there exists no available field data that can be used to directly evaluate the snowmelt contribution in the brb in this study we referenced studies in the literature that broached on issues related to snowmelt contributions at locations near to our study area for example tan et al 2012 collected water samples from the huangshui river and determined that its oxygen isotope concentration was very close to that of precipitation in the qilian mountains where the huangshui river originates indicating that precipitation is the major source in this river system however due to limited snow samples their study was not able to quantify precipitation and snowmelt contributions to river runoff considering that the heihe river also originates from the qilian mountains and has similar climatic and topographic conditions to that of the brb isotopic tracing results to partition river flow components from the heihe river can be used as a reference using oxygen 18 zhang et al 2009 concluded that snowmelt accounted for 19 8 of total streamflow and its monthly contribution to heihe river discharge ranged between 6 46 and 26 1 in 2000 these findings were similar to the results from our study to compare the sc s from the snowmelt tracking method and an indirect method we calculated snow contribution using the ratio of snowmelt to total streamflow based on model simulations which was 45 16 at the basin outlet being much higher than the tracking snowmelt pathway and oxygen 18 results this indicated estimates from previous studies using indirect measurements to quantify snow contribution to streamflow may be inaccurate the overestimate was because the method failed to account for some of the snowmelt that remained in soil column percolated to deeper layers or involved in evapotranspiration which wouldn t reach the basin outlet for example here the snowmelt tracking approach showed that average sc sm and sc et were about 13 and 10 26 respectively table 5 it is important to note that the hmt method proposed in this study has potential uncertainties which assumes that all water sources such as snowmelt rainfall etc are homogeneously mixed once amassed for example li et al 2017 reported that rainfall during rain on snow events is more likely to form runoff than snowmelt rain on snow events can also accelerate snowmelt wayand et al 2015 given the short time span of this study in measuring irradiance data at only one station bk aws to adjust calculated long term incoming irradiance which is an important driving force for snow hydrology irradiance uncertainty must also be evaluated furthermore certain parameters such as snow albedo sa and rain snow temperature partitioning rstp can also impact snowpack simulations in the dhsvm therefore to analyze snowmelt simulation uncertainties incoming shortwave radiation isr incoming longwave radiation ilr and sa effects which increased decreased by 10 10 as well as changes to temperature thresholds 1 1 c were employed in the dhsvm table 6 provides the uncertainties caused by the above parameters variables to annual snowmelt respective to the level of importance rstp ranked first among the four factors followed by ilr while sa and isr had little impact on annual snowmelt in the dhsvm rstp determines the form of precipitation and ilr plays a key role in snowpack energy and mass dynamics during the early snowmelt season the net radiation at the snow surface will decrease as ilr decreases if net radiation falls below 0 w m2 rainfall will refreeze and release energy to balance this negative net radiation in the dhsvm refrozen water from rainfall is defined as a component of snow accumulation thus the snowpack will increase with a decrease in ilr this snowpack increase will melt away during the warm season leading to an increase in annual snowmelt this process is essentially reversed when ilr increases increased sa had similar effects and processes to that of the decrease ilr unlike persistent influence of rstp in march november both ilr and sa exerted great impacts only in melting and freezing periods especially in april may and september when isr was still low and its average was about 55 90 of ilr meanwhile ilr keeps presence throughout a day but isr only exists in the daytime thus although increased sa and decreased ilr had similar effects the seasonality and diurnal cycle of the radiation components rendered a stronger role of ilr in melting and freezing periods in general reasonable rstp and ilr are crucial for snowmelt simulations sicart et al 2006 sims and liu 2015 given that longwave radiation measurements are sparse and are not routinely measured especially in high altitude regions yang et al 2010 the impact of longwave radiation on snowmelt requires further attention frozen soil is widely distributed throughout the tibetan plateau and it influences surface water and groundwater flow by limiting moisture exchanges between deep ground and the atmosphere decreasing the ability for infiltration while even rechanneling surface water cuo et al 2015 fuss et al 2016 we assumed that this phenomenon is not critical for this study as permafrost soil accounts for 12 15 of the basin as reported by wang 2006 however such a conjecture requires further investigation in the future after the frozen soil algorithm is coupled to the model in addition future climate forcings used in this study are generated based on historical data representing a synthetic future case and thus the future simulation only qualitatively estimates the future changes of hydrological processes in the brb further studies should employ bias correction and downscaling approach to obtain reliable climate projections from multiple earth system models for a range of emission scenarios much like the brb data from meteorological stations have shown that the tibetan plateau is also experiencing a significant temperature increase and a significant wind speed decrease ding et al 2018 li et al 2018b ding et al 2021 according to ma et al 2018 precipitation in most areas of the tibetan plateau decreases in october when snowfall starts to accumulate which is consistent with the precipitation trend that our study observed in october in the brb hence results in this study can be extrapolated to other catchments that share similar climate change and environmental conditions to that of the brb furthermore like what has been reported in the yarlung tsangpo basin in the southern region of the tibetan plateau cuo et al 2019 this study has also showed potential freshwater resource shortages in the future during the sowing and sprouting season in the brb which will be partly due to a reduction in mountain snowpack 6 conclusions as an important natural reservoir mountain snowpacks provide an indispensable water resource to communities and ecosystems globally quantifying snowmelt contributions to streamflow and evaluating impacts of snowpack change on streamflow are essential for regional water resource management and disaster prevention in high altitude and latitude regions however most current studies have partitioned snowmelt contributions to streamflow without considering snowmelt pathways resulting in inaccurate quantification this study integrated a snowmelt pathway tracking algorithm i e homogeneously mixed tracking hmt to the high resolution physically based dhsvm to track snowmelt movement and to quantify snowmelt contributions during surface hydrologic processes a simplified reservoir regulation scheme was also integrated into the model which allowed us to explore the combined effects of snow change and reservoir regulation on streamflow results from this case study are summarized as follows between 1965 and 2019 the brb experienced a significant decrease in annual snow cover area sca and 1998 was determined to be the point of abrupt change temperature was the most significant contributing factor to a decrease in sca i e compared to precipitation and wind speed the degree of variation respective to the snow contribution to soil moisture sc sm was lower in deeper soil layers and their peaks lagged behind the upper layer at a monthly scale annual sc sm in all soil layers experienced a significant decreasing trend with abrupt changes occurring after 2000 similar to monthly sca the monthly snow contribution to streamflow sc s exhibited a bimodal pattern annual sc s at all four hydrologic stations significantly decreased throughout the study period 1965 2019 reservoir operations had little effect 2 on sc s at a monthly scale if current climate conditions continue their trajectory into the future annual sca will decrease and will be the key reason for reductions in annual and monthly streamflow lastly current reservoir regulations will not help prevent this predicted reduction in streamflow especially during the sowing and

2579,snowpack will vary with climate change and is of vital importance for water supply the energy balance and heat exchange environmental factors such as thermal atmospheric terrestrial and hydrological factors influence variations in snow mass this study aimed to investigate associations with environmental factors and variations in snow mass changes based on satellite retrieved products in the northern hemisphere nh a zero inflated space time autoregressive zi star model is proposed to identify the environmental factors associated with the swe changes during the snow accumulation and ablation periods in north america and eurasia because of the spatial patterns temporal lag effect and excessive zero observations captured with the satellite based snow water equivalent swe product the proposed zi star model which considers spatial time lag and zero inflation effects together offered the best overall performance for swe simulations with high precision average r2 of 0 90 while the others range from 0 69 to 0 84 and low spatially random distributed residuals rmse 23 33 less than other model compared to time lag and spatial autoregressive models based on the results air temperature and snow precipitation dominate the variations in swe across the period of interest the influence of water vapor varies and the wind speed and topography have little effect due to the missing swe observations in mountainous areas the variations in the environmental factors for swe furnish a foundation for further research about snow changes in the nh the proposed zi star model also gives a feasible approach for spatio temporal continuous variables modeling with excessive zero observations in other fields keywords snow mass changes environmental influence zero inflation regression spatiotemporal effects 1 introduction snow plays a vital role in hydrological processes and acts as a sensitive indicator of global climate changes as a critical parameter of the cryosphere huang et al 2021 javadinejad et al 2019 kong and wang 2017 wu et al 2021 snow accumulation and ablation processes act as a critical source of freshwater supply and its variations over years would reveal a global climate change trend barnett et al 2005 han et al 2019 due to the strong seasonal variations in snowpack it is of vital importance to investigate the influences of environmental factors on snowpack and its changes over time in the northern hemisphere nh where most of the world s population lives in among the snow parameters snow water equivalent swe is a good indicator to represent both amount of water stored in the snow layer and the extent of snow distribution dietz et al 2012 fatahi nafchi et al 2021 frei et al 2012 for the entire nh satellite based swe products such as amsr e fy mwri and globsnow offer numerous advantages due to their wide geographical extent compared with traditional ground station observations most research on swe focuses on its retrievals and regional variations changes over time a decreasing trend has been reported in high mountain asia from 1987 to 2009 and changes in spatial and temporal distributions in the study area have been analyzed across altitudes smith and bookhagen 2018 pulliainen et al 2020 reported reductions in snow mass across north america and a consistent trend across eurasia together with strong trends in several typical regions during the period 1980 2018 based on the maximum snow mass in march of each year a decline in swe in the pacific northwest was associated with climatic causes including temperature and precipitation mote 2003 talebmorad and ostad ali askari 2022 anthropogenic and natural effects in various combinations with greenhouse gases on spring swe changes have been investigated in different regions in the nh using linear trend analysis and empirical orthogonal functions jeong et al 2017 although some research has investigated the environmental influences on swe changes most are limited to a set of environmental factors such as elevation air temperature snowfall and precipitation without a consideration of spatial and temporal effects which may lead to potentially suboptimal analysis results and interpretations anselin and griffith 1988 for example huang et al 2017 found that increases in rainfall and temperature led to less snow accumulation in their study examining changing trends of snow cover areas and swe in the tibetan plateau during the period 2001 2014 they also reported that elevation is positively associated with snow cover in this area zhong et al 2021a investigated the relationship between snow cover and climatic factors including precipitation and air temperature across eurasia skaugen et al 2012 showed that seasonal changes in precipitation and temperature are important for swe in their investigation of swe changes in norway yu et al 2017 documented declines in snow cover in siberia but found no quantitative associations with spatial and temporal changes brown and mote 2009 found a complex response of swe to precipitation and temperature räisänen 2021 reported swe variability was dominated by precipitation in colder parts of northern europe but governed by the efficiency of snowmelt and snowfall fraction in warmer areas of northern europe other factors including changes in total precipitation the snowfall fraction of precipitation and the snow on ground fraction were discussed in detail to explain their contribution to interannual snow changes in their research the effects of these factors including air temperature latitude and snowfall on observed changes through time and the duration of snow cover with observations at ground stations were also quantified to date little research has analyzed swe changes environmental factors and spatiotemporal effects and the variations of the environmental factors during the snow evolution process snow accumulation and ablation in the nh with various satellite retrieved environmental products and spatiotemporal analysis methods it is feasible to investigate precise snowpack changes with environmental influences on a hemispheric scale however for the satellite retrieved swe products there are excessive zero values zero inflation in areas from mid to low latitudes and altitudes in the nh especially at the beginning of the snow accumulation and the end of ablation periods in a snow year from previous autumn to next spring the number of zero observations also varies greatly by season their presence frustrates the examination of environmental influences and removing zero observations would lead to a selective bias zero inflated methods would furnish an appropriate tool to model swe with excessive zeros and have been applied to various applications for example savage et al 2015 utilized a zero inflated regression model that uses a two step process for forest canopy cover mapping from landsat imagery they show that the zero inflated model reduces bias and closely matches the in situ landscape when compared to traditional models especially in non forest areas parveen et al 2016 show that the tweedie model is suitable for evaluating their earnings data influenced by job training programs with a substantial proportion of zero values lambert 1992 proposed zero inflated regression for a poisson random variable with excessive zeros the results show that zip models are easy to interpret together with more refined data analyses liu et al 2019 reviewed statistical methods for zero inflated nonnegative continuous variables they found that there is no such method that performs all aspects including statistical inference variable selection complexity and so on it depends on the research intention and distribution of variable for specific zero inflated model to choose torabi 2017 constructed a zero inflated poisson spatio temporal model for disease incidence mapping with excessive zero counts the model accommodated conditional autoregressive model for spatial variations and b spline smoothing for temporal variation which had been applied to an empirical dataset that contains 56 geographic areas across 48 months the feasibility of this zero inflated spatio temporal model is questionable for grid based monthly swe panel dataset with millions of observations across nearly 20 years this study investigates the association of swe changes with environmental influences including thermal atmospheric terrestrial and hydrological factors during the accumulation and ablation periods in the nh by zero inflated space time autoregressive zi star models which consider spatial temporal lag and zero inflation effects together the objectives are as follows 1 to explore the significant factors associated with swe variations 2 to evaluate the performance of the proposed zi star model 3 to investigate the association of the selected factors and swe in north america and eurasia during accumulation and ablation periods 2 study region and datasets 2 1 study region snowfall is prone to distributed in areas with high altitudes and latitudes on a hemispheric scale there would be little chance for snowfall and therefore for snow cover to accumulate in most low altitude and low latitude areas this study focuses on the continents of eurasia and north america in the nh which include all permafrost areas and seasonal snowfall areas above latitude 40 n 2 2 swe products swe products can be measured in various ways such as passive microwave retrievals utilizing forms of reanalysis and a combination of passive microwave remote sensing and ground observations mortimer et al 2020 most swe products are estimated by snow depth from passive microwave radiometers and snow densities from climatic models hill et al 2019 niedzielski et al 2019 studies compare commonly used swe products including ssm i amsr e and globsnow and suggest that globsnow is the best global product however there is no single product that performs best across all regions hancock et al 2013 egli et al 2009 compared automated methods to determine swe and present their case that there is no ideal method for swe estimation globsnow integrates information from passive microwave radiometer estimates and ground measurements from 1978 to the present day pulliainen 2006 takala et al 2011 it has been shown that the swe quantities from the globsnow product are largely similar to the ground station measurements throughout all seasons for six common snow classes jiuliang and zhen 2013 yang et al 2020 examined the accuracy of globsnow 2 with three reference datasets with results showing that assimilation by globsnow 2 tends to overestimate swe in china globsnow 3 0 products based on a bayesian inversion approach assimilating passive microwave brightness temperature with observations from weather stations have been published for the extended period up to may 2018 together with a bias corrected swe dataset that reduced the uncertainty from 33 to 7 4 by bias correction in non alpine areas for the nh above 40 n based on in field snow courses observations pulliainen et al 2020 fig 1 shows the average globsnow3 0 swe map in february 2000 the regions in red are water bodies light yellow represents mountainous areas and the grey regions are lands without snow cover the regions in blue are covered by snow with the swe amount increasing from light to dark blue this map shows that the swe was distributed above 30 n and that the distribution of snow displayed strong autocorrelation the globsnow 3 0 swe product https www globsnow info swe archive v3 0 last accessed february 10 2022 was adopted for this study due to its wide coverage and long duration with high overall precision it includes bias corrected swe which was performed by using the interpolated snow course reference bias however the bias corrected product contains only 4 months february to may swe in each year due to the lack of a sufficient number of in field observations from snow courses in the other months in this study the globsnow 3 0 product with bias correction provided the main input and the product without bias correction served as a supplement during the period lacking in field observations from snow courses besides there would be negative values in bias corrected swe estimates and those have been further corrected by globsnow swe estimates the resulting swe has less uncertainty than the globsnow bias corrected swe 2 3 environmental factors potential factors such as thermal atmospheric terrestrial and hydrological features are identified to explain environmental influences on sew distributions dadic et al 2010 liston 1999 litaor et al 2008 saydi and ding 2020 table a1 in appendix summarizes information about 26 selected potential satellite retrieved factors spread across 4 categories from literature reviews together with the globsnow 3 0 swe product as the most direct factor affecting snow accumulation and ablation temperature is collected from different locations at the top and bottom of the snow layer including air temperature land surface temperature day night and soil temperature 0 10 cm underground besides solar radiation which directly affects temperature variations the downward longwave shortwave radiation fluxes were also included the ground heat flux accounts for the energy gained or lost on the land surface and is a potential factor influencing swe accumulation and ablation bennett et al 2008 vegetation cover was selected for this study due to its interception of radiation in boreal forest regions and albedo was selected because of the reflective property of snow and the feedback mechanisms siegert 2014 the atmospheric moisture factors such as specific humidity potential evaporation rate evapotranspiration transpiration sky water vapor cloud water content were selected because they serve as prerequisite conditions for snow formation wind speed is included because drifting snow is one of the typical snowfall types that is blown by the wind in some areas soil moisture is included due to its interaction with snow variations additionally precipitation including rain snow and total precipitation were included in this study because percolating rainfall would contribute to melt the snow during the rain on snow events when the temperature above 0 and snowfall would help to increase the snow mass when the temperature under freezing mazurkiewicz et al 2008 the details of all candidate environmental variables are contained in table a1 in

noah 3 6 model containing 36 land surface fields from january to the present day rodell et al 2004 all of these variables were projected to the same coordinates lambert azimuthal equal area projection and resampled to the same cell size with swe figure a1 displays these variables in march 2000 the spatial effects cannot be ignored particularly the spatial autocorrelation presented in the distributions of the snowpack and environmental factors figs 1 and a1 although the globsnow3 0 product covers the period from 1978 to 2018 most of the satellite based environmental factors with both relatively fine spatial and temporal resolution were gathered from modis which was launched in 2000 therefore this study focuses on the period 2000 2018 due to the lack of satellite based environmental variables prior to 2000 3 methodology 3 1 seasonal mann kendall test the seasonal mann kendall trend test seasonal mk test was used to test the trend of swe quantity change as a nonparametric test it works for all distributions the seasonal mk test conducts a separate mk trend test on each of the seasons separately the score statistic s is calculated by comparing each value with all values at subsequent time points for the indicator the null hypothesis h0 for mk test is that there is no trend present in the data the alternative hypothesis ha is that a trend exists this trend can be positive or negative there is also a corresponding p value which indicate whether to reject the null hypothesis if p value is lower than 0 05 the most common choice as the threshold the null hypothesis is rejected thus suggesting there is a statistically significant trend present the statistic s is given by 1 s k 1 n 1 j k 1 n s i g n x j x k 2 s i g n x j x k 1 if x j x k 0 0 i f x j x k 0 1 i f x j x k 0 where x 1 x 2 x n represent n data points and x j represents the data point at time j a high positive value of s indicates an increasing trend and vice versa moreover the probability associated with s and the sample size n were used to identify the significance of the trend hirsch et al 1982 3 2 spatial autoregressive model spatial regression models have been utilized to account for spatial autocorrelation in regression models a spatial lag model for example specifies spatial dependence in a spatially lagged dependent variable emphasizing the importance of neighborhood effects 3 y ρ w y x β n 0 σ 2 i where wy is the spatially lagged dependent variable for weights x is the matrix of observations on the explanatory variable is a vector of errors ρ is the spatial autocorrelation parameter and β is a parameter for the covariates a spatial error model on the other hand has a spatially autocorrelated error term that may arise from unobservable latent spatially autocorrelated variables or neighborhood effects anselin and bera 1998 a spatial error model can be expressed as follows 4 y x β i ρ w 1 ε ε n 0 σ 2 i where i is the identity matrix ρ is a scalar spatial autocorrelation parameter w is an n by n spatial weights matrix and ε is an error term that follows an independent normal distribution the difference between the two aforementioned spatial regression models lies in the ways spatial dependence is handled the lagrange multiplier lm test and robust lm test can be used to choose an appropriate spatial regression model baltagi and yang 2013 when the lag and error specifications are both statistically significant using the lm test a robust lm test can be used to further understand which type of spatial dependence to choose 3 3 zero inflated space time autoregressive model a spatiotemporal regression model would be able to capture spatial and temporal effects however there are many zero values in the swe observations which means there is no snowpack in some areas especially at the beginning and end of a snow year excessive zero values would lead to heterogeneity of variance for typical spatiotemporal regression models therefore a zero inflated spatiotemporal regression zi star model is proposed to account for the spatial temporal and zero inflation effects for modelling snow mass and the dominant environmental factors the two parts in zi star capture two processes for snow modelling whether snow covered an area or not and how the snow mass varies once covered popular zero inflated models including the zero inflated poisson zip model the zero inflated negative binomial zinb and the hurdle models have seldom been used to model swe a zip model is not appropriate for continuous swe values due to the discrete the nature of the poisson distribution min and agresti 2002 in contrast the zero altered gamma zag model furnishes a method for modeling zero inflated continuous data and has potential for many applications with a mixture of gamma and bernoulli distributions zuur and ieno 2016 in a zag model all zeros are modeled with bernoulli distributions and the nonzero values are modeled with gamma distributions the first of the two parts in a zag model focuses on the presence and absence of swe dependent variable while the second focuses on what drives the swe once swe is present a bernoulli model is used for the first part and a gamma model is used for the second part inspired by the zero inflated model a zero inflated space time autoregressive zi star model is proposed to account for zero inflation spatial effects and time lag effects in modeling swe in this study parajuli et al 2020 räisänen and eklund 2012 it is an extension of the zero inflated model and includes a spatial autoregressive component and a time lag term in its specification there are two processes in a zi star model the first process binary part drives whether the value is zero or positive and the second process continuous part is governed by a spatial autoregressive model where some of the values may be zero as well in addition a time lag item β t y t 1 is added to the two processes to account for temporal effects from the last time points in this study the binary part uses a time lagged logit model and the continuous part uses a space time error model based on the lagrange multiplier and robust lagrange multiplier tests both the spatial lag and spatial error models are significant but the spatial error model is more significant in a zi star model observations of all time points are combined to obtain global parameters a zi star model can be expressed as follows 5 sw e t z i s t a r y t π t 6 e swe t y t π t 7 l o g i t π t γ t π t 1 γ 0 k 1 k x k t γ k t 8 y t β t y t 1 β 0 k 1 k x k t β k t i ρ w 1 ε where π t is the odds of being zero or non zero for the binary part at time point t γ t is the time lag coefficient for the binary part γ 0 is the intercept for the binary part x k t is the covariates and γ k t are corresponding coefficients for the binary part for the continuous part β t y t 1 is the time lag item β 0 is the intercept ρ is a scalar spatial autocorrelation parameter w is an n by n spatial weights matrix and ε is an error term that follows an independent normal distribution in a zi star model the binary and continuous parts both use the maximum likelihood estimation method for parameter estimation for the continuous part the monte carlo method to approximate the log determinants is utilized for a large spatial weight matrix w in this study the model is mainly implemented by custom functions based on packages in r software the spatial weights matrix is constructed with queen type by cell2nb function from spdep package the list of spatial neighbors for each month are concatenated across the period the regression is implemented by custom functions based on packages including rcompanion spatialreg ape car mass and rsq the visualization of maps are displayed via arcmap software 3 4 model performance validation in order to evaluate the performance of the proposed zi star model several common metrics are selected and compared with time lag and spatial autoregressive sar models in this study a time lag model only considers temporal effects by adding a time lag item y t 1 as a covariate due to the seasonal variations for snow keele and kelly 2006 rupp et al 2013 the sar model employs specification of spatial error model as equation 4 after lm test and robust lm test the lm and robust lm tests of both specifications for sar are significant to reject the null hypothesis but the robust lm test for spatial error specification has larger value anselin et al 1996 the pseudo r2 serves as the goodness of fit for the model because the r2 of zi star cannot be directly calculated it is defined as the r2 of a linear regression between the fitted values and observed values ranging from 0 to 1 nagelkerke 1991 the greater the pseudo r2 represents the better model the root mean squared error rmse is the standard deviation of the residuals measuring how spread out the residuals are barnston 1992 the moran coefficient of the residuals are computed to validate whether the spatial autocorrelation had been filtered out and thus the residuals are spatial spatially random distributed griffith and getis 2017 the mc value ranges between 1 and 1 for a row standardized spatial weights matrix the null hypothesis for mc states that the attribute is randomly distributed in the study area with an expected value nearly 0 luo et al 2017 the mc of residuals is defined as follows 9 mc n i 1 n j 1 n c ij i 1 n j 1 n c i j e i e e j e i 1 n e i e 2 where e is the residuals n is the total number of geographical observations c i j is the elements of the row standardized spatial weights matrix which representing the weights between observations i and j besides the akaike information criterion aic is employed to compare the overall performance of models by considering the goodness of fit and simplicity at the same time akaike 1974 4 results 4 1 time series change of snowpack fig 2 displays the monthly total snow mass in the nh from january 2000 to may 2018 the line plot represents total snow mass in each month by summarizing all pixels of bias corrected monthly globsnow3 0 swe there is a strong seasonal characteristic for snow variations and the time lag effects also play a role in periodic snow variations it is concluded that the maximum snow mass occurs in february or march in each snow year due to the seasonal variations in the environmental factors associated with snowpack changes and the periodic variations in the snow mass the subsequent study separates the snow year into two periods by assuming that october to february is the snow accumulation period and march to may is the snow ablation period fig 3 displays the monthly total snow mass for north america and eurasia from october 2000 to may 2018 each square represent the total snow mass summed up pixel by pixel in the specific month based on the bias corrected swe dataset described in section 2 2 the statistics are arranged by snow fall year from october to may for convenience for the first row in north america as an example the squares from left to right represent the months in sequence from october 2017 to may 2018 as shown in fig 3 eurasia has more snow mass from january to march than north america but there is fewer differences in other months table 1 lists the seasonal mk statistic s and corresponding p value for each month on the two continents during the period 2000 2018 although the mk statistics s in north america vary from positive to negative the values are relatively small and the corresponding p values are not significant indicating that there is no significant changes from month to month for eurasia the mk statistics s for every month are negative and significant with the exception of april and may the absolute s value in eurasia increase and then decrease from october to march which means that the decreased trends are the strongest during the middle months of the snow year 4 2 correlation analysis with environmental factors correlation analysis was conducted to evaluate the strength of the relationship between the snow mass and environmental factors pearson product moment correlations were calculated separately by month and year to investigate the associations and their variations across yearly and monthly scales the yearly data are prepared as a mean of swe in february and march since the swe peaks in these two months each year fig 4 presents the correlation coefficients between snow mass and potential environmental factors by year the grids in fig 4 report the pearson correlation coefficients for swe and individual factors by year together with colors signifying correlation coefficient ranges when the correlation coefficient switches from negative to positive the color changes gradually from blue to red there are a handful of grid cells covered by a simple hatch that point to insignificant correlation coefficients i e p values 0 05 for yearly snowpack in the nh most of the correlation coefficients of the 26 potential factors are consistent across the period but for wind speed and soil moisture among the 26 potential factors latitude and albedo have the highest positive correlation with snow mass in the nh air pressure cloud water vapor and snow precipitation ratio have moderate positive correlation with snowpack thermal factors have the strongest negative correlation with snow mass including ground heat flux air temperature land surface temperature day night soil temperature downward longwave radiation and downward shortwave radiation the potential evaporation rate has a strong negative correlation with snow as well atmospheric water related factors including evapotranspiration humidity and transpiration have moderate negative correlations with snowpack rain precipitation rate and ndvi have negative correlations with snow mass topographical factors including elevation slope and roughness all have weak to moderate negative correlations with snow mass there is nearly no correlation between aspect northness and snow mass as well as wind speed and soil moisture fig 5 shows the correlation coefficients by month from october to may the monthly data were prepared with the mean snow mass for each month over the 18 year period in general the monthly correlations of the 26 potential factors mirror the yearly correlation results and display greater variability latitude and albedo still have the highest positive correlation with snow mass followed by snow precipitation and air pressure thermal factors including temperature and radiation related variables still have the strongest negative correlation with snowpack variation followed by factors related to evapotranspiration and vegetation cover among the factors ground heat flux total precipitation rate soil moisture and cloud water vapor vary greatly across individual months suggesting that seasonal effects are critical to study the strength of the associations connecting environmental factors to snowpack a stepwise selection procedure was conducted to selected significant factors for further analysis to identify the influence of environmental factors on the variation of snowpack draper and smith 1998 meanwhile a serious multicollinearity problem arises because there are some highly correlated factors which all have significant correlation with snow among them thermal and temperature related factors have the highest correlation and only air temperature is included as a controlling factor for further study because air temperature at the top of snow layer has a direct impact during snow accumulation and ablation periods the atmospheric factors including evaporation transpiration humidity and sky water vapor were highly correlated so sky water vapor was chosen from this group other correlated factors included air pressure and elevation 0 96 slope and surface roughness 1 00 and albedo and latitude 0 85 in addition aspect northness and soil moisture were not correlated with snow mass and the total precipitation ratio was not included because it is the sum the rain and snow precipitation and these two components have opposite effects in terms of snowpack for the correlated factors which are all maintained after stepwise selection the factors which are significant and have greater correlations with snowpack were selected this meant that 10 factors elevation slope air temperature cloud water vapor ground heat flux ndvi rain precipitation ratio snow precipitation ratio sky water vapor and wind speed were included for further regression analysis 4 3 the zi star model results the dominant environmental factors have been identified for snow mass variation in the nh these selected factors are included in zi star model to clarify their contributions to snow variations during both accumulation and ablation periods for north america and eurasia table 2 shows the estimated coefficients of the zi star model in north america for both the snow accumulation and ablation periods it should be noted that the coefficients of the binary part are estimated for the log odds of the probabilities of whether there is snow coverage or not and the coefficients of the continuous part for snow accumulation once the binary part reports snow coverage with normalized covariates the binary part decides whether the snow exists the coefficients represent the increase with a one unit increase in a covariate while the continuous part reveals the snow mass increase with a per unit increase in a covariate as shown in table 2 air temperature plays a leading negative role across the two periods and the accompanying processes followed by snow precipitation rate positive associations the ground heat flux associations vary across the two periods and the accompanying processes the contribution to snow mass variation of the other factors varies greatly in the two periods as well table 3 shows the estimated coefficients of the zi star model for eurasia which reveal the strength of the associations with snow cover for these environmental factors elevation and rain precipitation have consistent contributions to snow mass variations unlike the other factors which vary greatly during both periods and with respect to the accompanying processes rain precipitation rate have positive contribution in north america but negative in eurasia to snow mass variations during both accumulation and ablation periods snow precipitation rate have positive contribution to snowpack variation except for the possibility of snow existing during ablation period in eurasia for the ground heat flux its contribution are quite opposite not only for the two processes possibility of snow cover and snow mass but also for the two snow periods slope acts quite different during the ablation period in both continents but the interpretation is not strong because it is hard to mirror local slope variation in a grid with spatial resolution of 25 km the contribution of other factors are too small to have prominent influence to snowpack variation the coefficients of swe lag represent the temporal lag effect for snow mass variation the time lag coefficient range from 0 55 to 0 90 which means strong positive temporal correlation for snowpack variation vif variance inflation factors are calculated to see whether there is multicollinearity in the regression models due to large vif values and the strong positive correlation with at lstd and lstn were removed from the regression analysis table 4 presents vifs in the two periods for both regions for at vif values 5 might be considered problematic but it was retained in the regression models because of its leading effects on snow variations for the other covariates the vifs are low to moderate and show that there is nearly no multicollinearity for the selected covariates in the regression models 4 4 model performance comparison the performance of the proposed zi star model are compared with time lag and spatial autoregressive sar models a time lag model considers temporal effects and a sar model considers spatial effects table 5 represents the selected metrics of model performance for the three models for the accumulation and ablation periods in north america and eurasia the proposed zi star has the smallest rmse and the highest pseudo r2 the residuals in the time lag models displayed significantly strong levels of spatial autocorrelation the sar and zi star models which have taken spatial effects into account in different ways have decreased levels of spatial autocorrelation in the residuals fig 6 presents the spatial distribution of residuals for the swe simulated by the three models in december the absolute values of sar and zi star residuals are lower than those of time lag residuals the positive values denote underestimation and distribute in eastern and southeast of hudson bay and alaska in north america southern west siberian plain yakutsk in eurasia the negative values denote overestimation and distribute mainly northern great lake plain in north america central west siberia plain yakutsk in russia and eastern europe to obtain a clear and intuitive picture of the fitted swe by the three models the further corrected globsnow and fitted swe of the time lag sar and zi star models are portrayed two typical distinct snow covered regions are selected and displayed for further discussion in details one region is selected around the great lakes in north america fig 7 because it is one of the typical areas with lake effect snowfall and complex geographical distributed snow cover notaro et al 2015 shi and xue 2019 suriano et al 2019 the other region is selected around the kazakh uplands in west siberia and central asia fig 8 because it is also a typical snow covered area with long winter rugged terrain stable snow cover in winter significant wind speeds and frequent snowstorms kenetayeva et al 2022 the distribution of snow within the kazakh uplands is highly dependent on the rugged terrain and moisture bearing winds and the density varies greatly during the snow period mashtayeva et al 2016 zhao et al 2022 the areas in red are wrongly fitted negative values and the grey areas are lands without snow cover the areas in blue are covered by snow with the swe amount increasing from light blue to dark blue the maps of both selected regions reveal that the sar and zi star models could capture variations of snowpack with higher accuracy than the other two models however for the areas with little snow cover and without snow cover the sar model is likely to be fitted incorrectly to negative values which do not exist in the real world 5 discussion 5 1 environmental factors for snowpack variations snowpack variations in the nh are explored by adding total snow mass in each grid from a satellite based swe product a slight but significant decreasing trend in the amount of snowpack has been reported in eurasia not only in march as discussed by pulliainen et al 2020 but also from october to february in a snow year potential factors are selected to investigate the environmental factor associations with snowpack variability thermal factors and consequent temperature factors including longwave radiation shortwave radiation air temperature land surface temperature day night and soil temperature still play leading roles with high absolute correlation coefficients on the hemispheric scale similar to regional studies bi et al 2015 notarnicola 2020 zhang et al 2021 zhong et al 2021a the strength of the associations of daytime land surface temperature is higher than that in the nighttime with snowpack variations and the shortwave radiation associations are higher than those for longwave radiation topographic factors such as elevation slope and roughness have similar associations to those reported for the altai mountains in china zhong et al 2021b but nearly no relation with aspect northness which is not consistent with the findings in this prior study this might be because the slope and aspect vary significantly in mountainous areas atmospheric water related factors have moderate negative correlations with snow mass similar to prior research qiao et al 2021 zhang et al 2019 however it needs further investigation about how these factors affect snowpack variation and whether the effects vary in snow accumulating and ablating process wind speed has little relation with snow which is different from regional studies in california s sierra nevada by haleakala et al 2021 this could be attributed to the types of snowfall affected by wind like blowing snow drifting snow and snow flurries which are unlikely to offer consistent effects at the continental scale as one of the factors having the strongest correlation with snowpack variations latitude is also highly correlated with other factors including the thermal and atmospheric factors in other words some of the interactions for snowpack and environmental factors are contributed from latitude the influence of vegetation cover on snowpack variation is also significant the reason is possibly associated with two aspects one is decreasing vegetation cover with increasing latitude on a hemispheric scale and the other is the effects from the forest canopies which would intercept radiation especially in forests in mid to high latitude areas andreadis et al 2009 based on exploring the strength of correlation of potential environmental factors for snow mass changes the variations of the contributions of the dominant factors have been further investigated together with the spatial and temporal effects that accompany the spatial distribution and periodic variations during snow years 5 2 variations of factors during snow accumulation and ablation period the results presented in tables 2 and 3 give a comparable quantitative analysis for the contribution of selected factors to the variations of the probability of snow coverage and the amount of snow mass on the land during accumulation and ablation periods it is obvious that air temperature still plays the leading role to identify whether snow exists and to simulate snow mass during accumulation and ablation the contribution of ground heat flux to snow mass is strong only during the snow ablation period the snow precipitation rate displays strong associations during the accumulation period but weaker associations during the ablation period the rain precipitation ratio effects vary in north america and eurasia rainfall would melt snow when the temperature above freezing but it will create a layer of ice on top of the snow if the surface temperature below freezing singh et al 1997 investigated that the rainfall rates alone have little effect to snowmelt but the impeding properties of the ice layers have more than doubled the storage capacity of the snowpack in the austrian alps regional rain on snow effects in the pacific northwest of the usa have been explored during the ablating period mazurkiewicz et al 2008 although the results of these regional mountainous studies does not apply to the swe dataset without mountainous area it is still referable in this study it is concluded that the impeding effect of ice layer for water storage capacity in snowpack is significant in north america moreover it is necessary to separate rain and snow from total precipitation due to their contrasting roles in snow evolution process and the interaction of rainfall and snow needs further exploration together with the effects of temperature gradients the influence of elevation is not as strong as that in prior regional studies especially in those station based observations but the trend is the same in both continents the effect of slope for snow mass is the same during accumulation period but vary during the ablation period and opposite in both processes for both continnets the elevation contributes more to snow mass variation during ablation in north america but for slope in eurasia however the topographic factors are weak in general mainly because of swe observations missing in mountainous areas which leads to less variations in terms of slope and elevation the effect of vegetation cover for snow existence is weak together with snow mass in north america but moderate during accumulation and strong during ablation for snow mass in eurasia sky water vapor contributes negatively to other processes but positively during snow ablation period in eurasia the interaction of water vapor and snow might exist in multiple processes for example preconditions together with cloud water content for snow formation ju et al 2013 absorbing and scattering solar radiation and terrestrial radiation including greenhouse effects and snow evolution including sublimation and evaporation after ablation heymsfield et al 2021 zhang et al 2019 it needs further investigation about when and which kind of the effects dominate snow mass variation during the process of snow evolution the influence of cloud water content during both periods and both continents are too small while taking the other dominant environmental factors into account the influence of wind speed is negative during accumulation and positive during ablation for both continents the results seem quite different than regional research of wind driven snow accumulation and ablation processes dadic et al 2010 mott et al 2018 wind could be engaged in multiple snow related processes including water vapor transmission types of snowfall like blowing snow and snowfall redistribution the wind effect varies with the spatial scale and extent therefore it is reasonable that the results would be quite different in this study due to the missing observations in mountainous areas together with the effects that accompany spatial scales 5 3 applicability of the zi star model regression is a typical statistical approach to investigate the contribution of explanatory variables to response variable s however strong spatial dependency presents in the geographical variables including swe and the environmental factors in this study which violates the hypothesis that the variables are independent and identically distributed anselin and griffith 1988 griffith and chun 2016 with the periodic variations for snowpack the correlation across time would have negligible influence when modelling with spatiotemporal dataset jiuliang and zhen 2013 qiao et al 2021 there are excessive zero observations on the land for the satellite retrieved swe products especially at the beginning of the snow accumulation and the end of the ablation periods in a snow year which would lead to potentially suboptimal analysis and interpretations the proposed zi star model takes spatial temporal and zero inflation effects in a two part model that divides the modelling with two processes the first determines whether snow accumulation occurs or not and the second simulates the specific values in areas where snow accumulate the performance of the zi star model has been compared with the time lag and sar models which takes at most one of the effects in this study using rmse r2 and aic for evaluating goodness of fit and residual mc values for checking whether spatial dependency effects have been taken into consideration the average r2 of time lag sar and zi star are 0 83 0 78 and 0 90 respectively the average rmse of the three models are 18 94 21 66 and 14 52 respectively the residuals mc values of zi star model have decreased close to the expectation of 1 n 1 the results show that zi star performs best among the three models with the highest accuracy and lowest randomly distributed residuals the model specification with two parts whether snow accumulated and how much swe accumulated once snow exists gives a clear and new picture to comprehend the swe accumulation and runoff process which can be used on hemispheric scale as well as regional and local scales if there are excessive zero values together with strong spatiotemporal effects in the distributions of the two factors although the origin of zeros is unclear and the zero observations is inconstant across periods the proposed zi star model could still capture the variation with greater performance for stable and reliable results the proposed zi star model also provides a feasible approach for spatiotemporal modeling for continuous variables with excessive zero observations in other geographic processes such as ecology modeling pollution detection analysis infectious disease mapping and so on 5 4 limitations this study identifies the dominant environmental factors associated with snow mass and investigated the variations of these factors in different periods however the influence of uncertainty accompanying the environmental factors were not considered the time lag effects are considered only for snowpack but not for the environmental factors which would have lead lag effects and even accumulating process like snow precipitation qiao et al 2021 although the swe product have been further corrected the results would vary with coarse spatial resolutions and the removal of mountainous areas another limitation for this study is that the results are limited to correlation and as such it remains difficult to clearly establish causation for the complex interaction for snow and the environmental factors based on this statistical approach in addition the spatial effects are only considered in the continuous parts a feasible spatial binary regression for large datasets could be included in future work 6 conclusion this study investigates snowpack variations and its associations with environmental factors in the nh during the period 2000 2018 using the proposed zi star model a significant decreasing trend is found for monthly total snow mass in eurasia from october to march and 26 potential satellite retrieved environmental factors were selected to explore correlations to snowpack changes thermal and atmospheric hydrological factors together with latitude and albedo have the strongest associations with the snow mass and seasonal effects are found to have critical influence to the strength of these associations a zi star model was proposed to investigate the contribution of dominant factors to snowpack variation for both the accumulation and ablation periods on the two continents with consideration of spatial temporal and zero inflation effects in the variables the zi star model performs best with an averaged r2 of 0 90 the r2 for the other models range from 0 69 to 0 84 and an average rmse of 14 52 mm 23 33 less than for the other models accompanied by residuals without spatial autocorrelation mc decreased from its peak of 0 50 to nearly 0 which reveals the need to consider space temporal effects for snow distribution and changes and the sequences of excessive number of zeros in satellite retrieved swe products based on zi star model air temperature and snow precipitation rate contribute much to the possibility of snow existence and snow mass variation the effect of rainfall on snow for water storage in snowpack are quite different in north america and eurasia and the interaction with temperature should be considered in detail for further study ground heat flux only contributes significantly to snow mass variation during the snow ablation period in both continents the influence of water vapor wind speed and topography have little effect due to the missing swe observations in mountainous areas the variations of the dominant factors are further discussed with the best performed zi star model which gives a new picture to comprehend snow accumulation and ablation period and the two processes of how affect the possibility of snow covered and how much snow mass by taking the spatial temporal and zero inflation effects into account together and lays the foundation for the prediction of snowpack in the nh and perhaps globally in the future in addition the proposed zi star model for continuous variable provide a feasible approach for other geographical spatiotemporal process modeling with similar situations declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work

2579,snowpack will vary with climate change and is of vital importance for water supply the energy balance and heat exchange environmental factors such as thermal atmospheric terrestrial and hydrological factors influence variations in snow mass this study aimed to investigate associations with environmental factors and variations in snow mass changes based on satellite retrieved products in the northern hemisphere nh a zero inflated space time autoregressive zi star model is proposed to identify the environmental factors associated with the swe changes during the snow accumulation and ablation periods in north america and eurasia because of the spatial patterns temporal lag effect and excessive zero observations captured with the satellite based snow water equivalent swe product the proposed zi star model which considers spatial time lag and zero inflation effects together offered the best overall performance for swe simulations with high precision average r2 of 0 90 while the others range from 0 69 to 0 84 and low spatially random distributed residuals rmse 23 33 less than other model compared to time lag and spatial autoregressive models based on the results air temperature and snow precipitation dominate the variations in swe across the period of interest the influence of water vapor varies and the wind speed and topography have little effect due to the missing swe observations in mountainous areas the variations in the environmental factors for swe furnish a foundation for further research about snow changes in the nh the proposed zi star model also gives a feasible approach for spatio temporal continuous variables modeling with excessive zero observations in other fields keywords snow mass changes environmental influence zero inflation regression spatiotemporal effects 1 introduction snow plays a vital role in hydrological processes and acts as a sensitive indicator of global climate changes as a critical parameter of the cryosphere huang et al 2021 javadinejad et al 2019 kong and wang 2017 wu et al 2021 snow accumulation and ablation processes act as a critical source of freshwater supply and its variations over years would reveal a global climate change trend barnett et al 2005 han et al 2019 due to the strong seasonal variations in snowpack it is of vital importance to investigate the influences of environmental factors on snowpack and its changes over time in the northern hemisphere nh where most of the world s population lives in among the snow parameters snow water equivalent swe is a good indicator to represent both amount of water stored in the snow layer and the extent of snow distribution dietz et al 2012 fatahi nafchi et al 2021 frei et al 2012 for the entire nh satellite based swe products such as amsr e fy mwri and globsnow offer numerous advantages due to their wide geographical extent compared with traditional ground station observations most research on swe focuses on its retrievals and regional variations changes over time a decreasing trend has been reported in high mountain asia from 1987 to 2009 and changes in spatial and temporal distributions in the study area have been analyzed across altitudes smith and bookhagen 2018 pulliainen et al 2020 reported reductions in snow mass across north america and a consistent trend across eurasia together with strong trends in several typical regions during the period 1980 2018 based on the maximum snow mass in march of each year a decline in swe in the pacific northwest was associated with climatic causes including temperature and precipitation mote 2003 talebmorad and ostad ali askari 2022 anthropogenic and natural effects in various combinations with greenhouse gases on spring swe changes have been investigated in different regions in the nh using linear trend analysis and empirical orthogonal functions jeong et al 2017 although some research has investigated the environmental influences on swe changes most are limited to a set of environmental factors such as elevation air temperature snowfall and precipitation without a consideration of spatial and temporal effects which may lead to potentially suboptimal analysis results and interpretations anselin and griffith 1988 for example huang et al 2017 found that increases in rainfall and temperature led to less snow accumulation in their study examining changing trends of snow cover areas and swe in the tibetan plateau during the period 2001 2014 they also reported that elevation is positively associated with snow cover in this area zhong et al 2021a investigated the relationship between snow cover and climatic factors including precipitation and air temperature across eurasia skaugen et al 2012 showed that seasonal changes in precipitation and temperature are important for swe in their investigation of swe changes in norway yu et al 2017 documented declines in snow cover in siberia but found no quantitative associations with spatial and temporal changes brown and mote 2009 found a complex response of swe to precipitation and temperature räisänen 2021 reported swe variability was dominated by precipitation in colder parts of northern europe but governed by the efficiency of snowmelt and snowfall fraction in warmer areas of northern europe other factors including changes in total precipitation the snowfall fraction of precipitation and the snow on ground fraction were discussed in detail to explain their contribution to interannual snow changes in their research the effects of these factors including air temperature latitude and snowfall on observed changes through time and the duration of snow cover with observations at ground stations were also quantified to date little research has analyzed swe changes environmental factors and spatiotemporal effects and the variations of the environmental factors during the snow evolution process snow accumulation and ablation in the nh with various satellite retrieved environmental products and spatiotemporal analysis methods it is feasible to investigate precise snowpack changes with environmental influences on a hemispheric scale however for the satellite retrieved swe products there are excessive zero values zero inflation in areas from mid to low latitudes and altitudes in the nh especially at the beginning of the snow accumulation and the end of ablation periods in a snow year from previous autumn to next spring the number of zero observations also varies greatly by season their presence frustrates the examination of environmental influences and removing zero observations would lead to a selective bias zero inflated methods would furnish an appropriate tool to model swe with excessive zeros and have been applied to various applications for example savage et al 2015 utilized a zero inflated regression model that uses a two step process for forest canopy cover mapping from landsat imagery they show that the zero inflated model reduces bias and closely matches the in situ landscape when compared to traditional models especially in non forest areas parveen et al 2016 show that the tweedie model is suitable for evaluating their earnings data influenced by job training programs with a substantial proportion of zero values lambert 1992 proposed zero inflated regression for a poisson random variable with excessive zeros the results show that zip models are easy to interpret together with more refined data analyses liu et al 2019 reviewed statistical methods for zero inflated nonnegative continuous variables they found that there is no such method that performs all aspects including statistical inference variable selection complexity and so on it depends on the research intention and distribution of variable for specific zero inflated model to choose torabi 2017 constructed a zero inflated poisson spatio temporal model for disease incidence mapping with excessive zero counts the model accommodated conditional autoregressive model for spatial variations and b spline smoothing for temporal variation which had been applied to an empirical dataset that contains 56 geographic areas across 48 months the feasibility of this zero inflated spatio temporal model is questionable for grid based monthly swe panel dataset with millions of observations across nearly 20 years this study investigates the association of swe changes with environmental influences including thermal atmospheric terrestrial and hydrological factors during the accumulation and ablation periods in the nh by zero inflated space time autoregressive zi star models which consider spatial temporal lag and zero inflation effects together the objectives are as follows 1 to explore the significant factors associated with swe variations 2 to evaluate the performance of the proposed zi star model 3 to investigate the association of the selected factors and swe in north america and eurasia during accumulation and ablation periods 2 study region and datasets 2 1 study region snowfall is prone to distributed in areas with high altitudes and latitudes on a hemispheric scale there would be little chance for snowfall and therefore for snow cover to accumulate in most low altitude and low latitude areas this study focuses on the continents of eurasia and north america in the nh which include all permafrost areas and seasonal snowfall areas above latitude 40 n 2 2 swe products swe products can be measured in various ways such as passive microwave retrievals utilizing forms of reanalysis and a combination of passive microwave remote sensing and ground observations mortimer et al 2020 most swe products are estimated by snow depth from passive microwave radiometers and snow densities from climatic models hill et al 2019 niedzielski et al 2019 studies compare commonly used swe products including ssm i amsr e and globsnow and suggest that globsnow is the best global product however there is no single product that performs best across all regions hancock et al 2013 egli et al 2009 compared automated methods to determine swe and present their case that there is no ideal method for swe estimation globsnow integrates information from passive microwave radiometer estimates and ground measurements from 1978 to the present day pulliainen 2006 takala et al 2011 it has been shown that the swe quantities from the globsnow product are largely similar to the ground station measurements throughout all seasons for six common snow classes jiuliang and zhen 2013 yang et al 2020 examined the accuracy of globsnow 2 with three reference datasets with results showing that assimilation by globsnow 2 tends to overestimate swe in china globsnow 3 0 products based on a bayesian inversion approach assimilating passive microwave brightness temperature with observations from weather stations have been published for the extended period up to may 2018 together with a bias corrected swe dataset that reduced the uncertainty from 33 to 7 4 by bias correction in non alpine areas for the nh above 40 n based on in field snow courses observations pulliainen et al 2020 fig 1 shows the average globsnow3 0 swe map in february 2000 the regions in red are water bodies light yellow represents mountainous areas and the grey regions are lands without snow cover the regions in blue are covered by snow with the swe amount increasing from light to dark blue this map shows that the swe was distributed above 30 n and that the distribution of snow displayed strong autocorrelation the globsnow 3 0 swe product https www globsnow info swe archive v3 0 last accessed february 10 2022 was adopted for this study due to its wide coverage and long duration with high overall precision it includes bias corrected swe which was performed by using the interpolated snow course reference bias however the bias corrected product contains only 4 months february to may swe in each year due to the lack of a sufficient number of in field observations from snow courses in the other months in this study the globsnow 3 0 product with bias correction provided the main input and the product without bias correction served as a supplement during the period lacking in field observations from snow courses besides there would be negative values in bias corrected swe estimates and those have been further corrected by globsnow swe estimates the resulting swe has less uncertainty than the globsnow bias corrected swe 2 3 environmental factors potential factors such as thermal atmospheric terrestrial and hydrological features are identified to explain environmental influences on sew distributions dadic et al 2010 liston 1999 litaor et al 2008 saydi and ding 2020 table a1 in appendix summarizes information about 26 selected potential satellite retrieved factors spread across 4 categories from literature reviews together with the globsnow 3 0 swe product as the most direct factor affecting snow accumulation and ablation temperature is collected from different locations at the top and bottom of the snow layer including air temperature land surface temperature day night and soil temperature 0 10 cm underground besides solar radiation which directly affects temperature variations the downward longwave shortwave radiation fluxes were also included the ground heat flux accounts for the energy gained or lost on the land surface and is a potential factor influencing swe accumulation and ablation bennett et al 2008 vegetation cover was selected for this study due to its interception of radiation in boreal forest regions and albedo was selected because of the reflective property of snow and the feedback mechanisms siegert 2014 the atmospheric moisture factors such as specific humidity potential evaporation rate evapotranspiration transpiration sky water vapor cloud water content were selected because they serve as prerequisite conditions for snow formation wind speed is included because drifting snow is one of the typical snowfall types that is blown by the wind in some areas soil moisture is included due to its interaction with snow variations additionally precipitation including rain snow and total precipitation were included in this study because percolating rainfall would contribute to melt the snow during the rain on snow events when the temperature above 0 and snowfall would help to increase the snow mass when the temperature under freezing mazurkiewicz et al 2008 the details of all candidate environmental variables are contained in table a1 in appendix land surface temperature day night vegetation index sky water vapor and cloud water content are obtained from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis instrument aboard nasa s terra and aqua satellites https neo gsfc nasa gov last accessed may 10 2022 the topographic variables including elevation slope roughness and aspect northness are based on the global 250 m gmted2010 amatulli et al 2018 calculated these variables at various spatial resolutions and global coverage https www earthenv org topography last accessed may 10 2022 in this study variables with 10 km resolutions were used the raster of latitude are extracted from elevation raster by calculate geometry tool of arcmap the other variables are obtained from the global land data assimilation system

noah 3 6 model containing 36 land surface fields from january to the present day rodell et al 2004 all of these variables were projected to the same coordinates lambert azimuthal equal area projection and resampled to the same cell size with swe figure a1 displays these variables in march 2000 the spatial effects cannot be ignored particularly the spatial autocorrelation presented in the distributions of the snowpack and environmental factors figs 1 and a1 although the globsnow3 0 product covers the period from 1978 to 2018 most of the satellite based environmental factors with both relatively fine spatial and temporal resolution were gathered from modis which was launched in 2000 therefore this study focuses on the period 2000 2018 due to the lack of satellite based environmental variables prior to 2000 3 methodology 3 1 seasonal mann kendall test the seasonal mann kendall trend test seasonal mk test was used to test the trend of swe quantity change as a nonparametric test it works for all distributions the seasonal mk test conducts a separate mk trend test on each of the seasons separately the score statistic s is calculated by comparing each value with all values at subsequent time points for the indicator the null hypothesis h0 for mk test is that there is no trend present in the data the alternative hypothesis ha is that a trend exists this trend can be positive or negative there is also a corresponding p value which indicate whether to reject the null hypothesis if p value is lower than 0 05 the most common choice as the threshold the null hypothesis is rejected thus suggesting there is a statistically significant trend present the statistic s is given by 1 s k 1 n 1 j k 1 n s i g n x j x k 2 s i g n x j x k 1 if x j x k 0 0 i f x j x k 0 1 i f x j x k 0 where x 1 x 2 x n represent n data points and x j represents the data point at time j a high positive value of s indicates an increasing trend and vice versa moreover the probability associated with s and the sample size n were used to identify the significance of the trend hirsch et al 1982 3 2 spatial autoregressive model spatial regression models have been utilized to account for spatial autocorrelation in regression models a spatial lag model for example specifies spatial dependence in a spatially lagged dependent variable emphasizing the importance of neighborhood effects 3 y ρ w y x β n 0 σ 2 i where wy is the spatially lagged dependent variable for weights x is the matrix of observations on the explanatory variable is a vector of errors ρ is the spatial autocorrelation parameter and β is a parameter for the covariates a spatial error model on the other hand has a spatially autocorrelated error term that may arise from unobservable latent spatially autocorrelated variables or neighborhood effects anselin and bera 1998 a spatial error model can be expressed as follows 4 y x β i ρ w 1 ε ε n 0 σ 2 i where i is the identity matrix ρ is a scalar spatial autocorrelation parameter w is an n by n spatial weights matrix and ε is an error term that follows an independent normal distribution the difference between the two aforementioned spatial regression models lies in the ways spatial dependence is handled the lagrange multiplier lm test and robust lm test can be used to choose an appropriate spatial regression model baltagi and yang 2013 when the lag and error specifications are both statistically significant using the lm test a robust lm test can be used to further understand which type of spatial dependence to choose 3 3 zero inflated space time autoregressive model a spatiotemporal regression model would be able to capture spatial and temporal effects however there are many zero values in the swe observations which means there is no snowpack in some areas especially at the beginning and end of a snow year excessive zero values would lead to heterogeneity of variance for typical spatiotemporal regression models therefore a zero inflated spatiotemporal regression zi star model is proposed to account for the spatial temporal and zero inflation effects for modelling snow mass and the dominant environmental factors the two parts in zi star capture two processes for snow modelling whether snow covered an area or not and how the snow mass varies once covered popular zero inflated models including the zero inflated poisson zip model the zero inflated negative binomial zinb and the hurdle models have seldom been used to model swe a zip model is not appropriate for continuous swe values due to the discrete the nature of the poisson distribution min and agresti 2002 in contrast the zero altered gamma zag model furnishes a method for modeling zero inflated continuous data and has potential for many applications with a mixture of gamma and bernoulli distributions zuur and ieno 2016 in a zag model all zeros are modeled with bernoulli distributions and the nonzero values are modeled with gamma distributions the first of the two parts in a zag model focuses on the presence and absence of swe dependent variable while the second focuses on what drives the swe once swe is present a bernoulli model is used for the first part and a gamma model is used for the second part inspired by the zero inflated model a zero inflated space time autoregressive zi star model is proposed to account for zero inflation spatial effects and time lag effects in modeling swe in this study parajuli et al 2020 räisänen and eklund 2012 it is an extension of the zero inflated model and includes a spatial autoregressive component and a time lag term in its specification there are two processes in a zi star model the first process binary part drives whether the value is zero or positive and the second process continuous part is governed by a spatial autoregressive model where some of the values may be zero as well in addition a time lag item β t y t 1 is added to the two processes to account for temporal effects from the last time points in this study the binary part uses a time lagged logit model and the continuous part uses a space time error model based on the lagrange multiplier and robust lagrange multiplier tests both the spatial lag and spatial error models are significant but the spatial error model is more significant in a zi star model observations of all time points are combined to obtain global parameters a zi star model can be expressed as follows 5 sw e t z i s t a r y t π t 6 e swe t y t π t 7 l o g i t π t γ t π t 1 γ 0 k 1 k x k t γ k t 8 y t β t y t 1 β 0 k 1 k x k t β k t i ρ w 1 ε where π t is the odds of being zero or non zero for the binary part at time point t γ t is the time lag coefficient for the binary part γ 0 is the intercept for the binary part x k t is the covariates and γ k t are corresponding coefficients for the binary part for the continuous part β t y t 1 is the time lag item β 0 is the intercept ρ is a scalar spatial autocorrelation parameter w is an n by n spatial weights matrix and ε is an error term that follows an independent normal distribution in a zi star model the binary and continuous parts both use the maximum likelihood estimation method for parameter estimation for the continuous part the monte carlo method to approximate the log determinants is utilized for a large spatial weight matrix w in this study the model is mainly implemented by custom functions based on packages in r software the spatial weights matrix is constructed with queen type by cell2nb function from spdep package the list of spatial neighbors for each month are concatenated across the period the regression is implemented by custom functions based on packages including rcompanion spatialreg ape car mass and rsq the visualization of maps are displayed via arcmap software 3 4 model performance validation in order to evaluate the performance of the proposed zi star model several common metrics are selected and compared with time lag and spatial autoregressive sar models in this study a time lag model only considers temporal effects by adding a time lag item y t 1 as a covariate due to the seasonal variations for snow keele and kelly 2006 rupp et al 2013 the sar model employs specification of spatial error model as equation 4 after lm test and robust lm test the lm and robust lm tests of both specifications for sar are significant to reject the null hypothesis but the robust lm test for spatial error specification has larger value anselin et al 1996 the pseudo r2 serves as the goodness of fit for the model because the r2 of zi star cannot be directly calculated it is defined as the r2 of a linear regression between the fitted values and observed values ranging from 0 to 1 nagelkerke 1991 the greater the pseudo r2 represents the better model the root mean squared error rmse is the standard deviation of the residuals measuring how spread out the residuals are barnston 1992 the moran coefficient of the residuals are computed to validate whether the spatial autocorrelation had been filtered out and thus the residuals are spatial spatially random distributed griffith and getis 2017 the mc value ranges between 1 and 1 for a row standardized spatial weights matrix the null hypothesis for mc states that the attribute is randomly distributed in the study area with an expected value nearly 0 luo et al 2017 the mc of residuals is defined as follows 9 mc n i 1 n j 1 n c ij i 1 n j 1 n c i j e i e e j e i 1 n e i e 2 where e is the residuals n is the total number of geographical observations c i j is the elements of the row standardized spatial weights matrix which representing the weights between observations i and j besides the akaike information criterion aic is employed to compare the overall performance of models by considering the goodness of fit and simplicity at the same time akaike 1974 4 results 4 1 time series change of snowpack fig 2 displays the monthly total snow mass in the nh from january 2000 to may 2018 the line plot represents total snow mass in each month by summarizing all pixels of bias corrected monthly globsnow3 0 swe there is a strong seasonal characteristic for snow variations and the time lag effects also play a role in periodic snow variations it is concluded that the maximum snow mass occurs in february or march in each snow year due to the seasonal variations in the environmental factors associated with snowpack changes and the periodic variations in the snow mass the subsequent study separates the snow year into two periods by assuming that october to february is the snow accumulation period and march to may is the snow ablation period fig 3 displays the monthly total snow mass for north america and eurasia from october 2000 to may 2018 each square represent the total snow mass summed up pixel by pixel in the specific month based on the bias corrected swe dataset described in section 2 2 the statistics are arranged by snow fall year from october to may for convenience for the first row in north america as an example the squares from left to right represent the months in sequence from october 2017 to may 2018 as shown in fig 3 eurasia has more snow mass from january to march than north america but there is fewer differences in other months table 1 lists the seasonal mk statistic s and corresponding p value for each month on the two continents during the period 2000 2018 although the mk statistics s in north america vary from positive to negative the values are relatively small and the corresponding p values are not significant indicating that there is no significant changes from month to month for eurasia the mk statistics s for every month are negative and significant with the exception of april and may the absolute s value in eurasia increase and then decrease from october to march which means that the decreased trends are the strongest during the middle months of the snow year 4 2 correlation analysis with environmental factors correlation analysis was conducted to evaluate the strength of the relationship between the snow mass and environmental factors pearson product moment correlations were calculated separately by month and year to investigate the associations and their variations across yearly and monthly scales the yearly data are prepared as a mean of swe in february and march since the swe peaks in these two months each year fig 4 presents the correlation coefficients between snow mass and potential environmental factors by year the grids in fig 4 report the pearson correlation coefficients for swe and individual factors by year together with colors signifying correlation coefficient ranges when the correlation coefficient switches from negative to positive the color changes gradually from blue to red there are a handful of grid cells covered by a simple hatch that point to insignificant correlation coefficients i e p values 0 05 for yearly snowpack in the nh most of the correlation coefficients of the 26 potential factors are consistent across the period but for wind speed and soil moisture among the 26 potential factors latitude and albedo have the highest positive correlation with snow mass in the nh air pressure cloud water vapor and snow precipitation ratio have moderate positive correlation with snowpack thermal factors have the strongest negative correlation with snow mass including ground heat flux air temperature land surface temperature day night soil temperature downward longwave radiation and downward shortwave radiation the potential evaporation rate has a strong negative correlation with snow as well atmospheric water related factors including evapotranspiration humidity and transpiration have moderate negative correlations with snowpack rain precipitation rate and ndvi have negative correlations with snow mass topographical factors including elevation slope and roughness all have weak to moderate negative correlations with snow mass there is nearly no correlation between aspect northness and snow mass as well as wind speed and soil moisture fig 5 shows the correlation coefficients by month from october to may the monthly data were prepared with the mean snow mass for each month over the 18 year period in general the monthly correlations of the 26 potential factors mirror the yearly correlation results and display greater variability latitude and albedo still have the highest positive correlation with snow mass followed by snow precipitation and air pressure thermal factors including temperature and radiation related variables still have the strongest negative correlation with snowpack variation followed by factors related to evapotranspiration and vegetation cover among the factors ground heat flux total precipitation rate soil moisture and cloud water vapor vary greatly across individual months suggesting that seasonal effects are critical to study the strength of the associations connecting environmental factors to snowpack a stepwise selection procedure was conducted to selected significant factors for further analysis to identify the influence of environmental factors on the variation of snowpack draper and smith 1998 meanwhile a serious multicollinearity problem arises because there are some highly correlated factors which all have significant correlation with snow among them thermal and temperature related factors have the highest correlation and only air temperature is included as a controlling factor for further study because air temperature at the top of snow layer has a direct impact during snow accumulation and ablation periods the atmospheric factors including evaporation transpiration humidity and sky water vapor were highly correlated so sky water vapor was chosen from this group other correlated factors included air pressure and elevation 0 96 slope and surface roughness 1 00 and albedo and latitude 0 85 in addition aspect northness and soil moisture were not correlated with snow mass and the total precipitation ratio was not included because it is the sum the rain and snow precipitation and these two components have opposite effects in terms of snowpack for the correlated factors which are all maintained after stepwise selection the factors which are significant and have greater correlations with snowpack were selected this meant that 10 factors elevation slope air temperature cloud water vapor ground heat flux ndvi rain precipitation ratio snow precipitation ratio sky water vapor and wind speed were included for further regression analysis 4 3 the zi star model results the dominant environmental factors have been identified for snow mass variation in the nh these selected factors are included in zi star model to clarify their contributions to snow variations during both accumulation and ablation periods for north america and eurasia table 2 shows the estimated coefficients of the zi star model in north america for both the snow accumulation and ablation periods it should be noted that the coefficients of the binary part are estimated for the log odds of the probabilities of whether there is snow coverage or not and the coefficients of the continuous part for snow accumulation once the binary part reports snow coverage with normalized covariates the binary part decides whether the snow exists the coefficients represent the increase with a one unit increase in a covariate while the continuous part reveals the snow mass increase with a per unit increase in a covariate as shown in table 2 air temperature plays a leading negative role across the two periods and the accompanying processes followed by snow precipitation rate positive associations the ground heat flux associations vary across the two periods and the accompanying processes the contribution to snow mass variation of the other factors varies greatly in the two periods as well table 3 shows the estimated coefficients of the zi star model for eurasia which reveal the strength of the associations with snow cover for these environmental factors elevation and rain precipitation have consistent contributions to snow mass variations unlike the other factors which vary greatly during both periods and with respect to the accompanying processes rain precipitation rate have positive contribution in north america but negative in eurasia to snow mass variations during both accumulation and ablation periods snow precipitation rate have positive contribution to snowpack variation except for the possibility of snow existing during ablation period in eurasia for the ground heat flux its contribution are quite opposite not only for the two processes possibility of snow cover and snow mass but also for the two snow periods slope acts quite different during the ablation period in both continents but the interpretation is not strong because it is hard to mirror local slope variation in a grid with spatial resolution of 25 km the contribution of other factors are too small to have prominent influence to snowpack variation the coefficients of swe lag represent the temporal lag effect for snow mass variation the time lag coefficient range from 0 55 to 0 90 which means strong positive temporal correlation for snowpack variation vif variance inflation factors are calculated to see whether there is multicollinearity in the regression models due to large vif values and the strong positive correlation with at lstd and lstn were removed from the regression analysis table 4 presents vifs in the two periods for both regions for at vif values 5 might be considered problematic but it was retained in the regression models because of its leading effects on snow variations for the other covariates the vifs are low to moderate and show that there is nearly no multicollinearity for the selected covariates in the regression models 4 4 model performance comparison the performance of the proposed zi star model are compared with time lag and spatial autoregressive sar models a time lag model considers temporal effects and a sar model considers spatial effects table 5 represents the selected metrics of model performance for the three models for the accumulation and ablation periods in north america and eurasia the proposed zi star has the smallest rmse and the highest pseudo r2 the residuals in the time lag models displayed significantly strong levels of spatial autocorrelation the sar and zi star models which have taken spatial effects into account in different ways have decreased levels of spatial autocorrelation in the residuals fig 6 presents the spatial distribution of residuals for the swe simulated by the three models in december the absolute values of sar and zi star residuals are lower than those of time lag residuals the positive values denote underestimation and distribute in eastern and southeast of hudson bay and alaska in north america southern west siberian plain yakutsk in eurasia the negative values denote overestimation and distribute mainly northern great lake plain in north america central west siberia plain yakutsk in russia and eastern europe to obtain a clear and intuitive picture of the fitted swe by the three models the further corrected globsnow and fitted swe of the time lag sar and zi star models are portrayed two typical distinct snow covered regions are selected and displayed for further discussion in details one region is selected around the great lakes in north america fig 7 because it is one of the typical areas with lake effect snowfall and complex geographical distributed snow cover notaro et al 2015 shi and xue 2019 suriano et al 2019 the other region is selected around the kazakh uplands in west siberia and central asia fig 8 because it is also a typical snow covered area with long winter rugged terrain stable snow cover in winter significant wind speeds and frequent snowstorms kenetayeva et al 2022 the distribution of snow within the kazakh uplands is highly dependent on the rugged terrain and moisture bearing winds and the density varies greatly during the snow period mashtayeva et al 2016 zhao et al 2022 the areas in red are wrongly fitted negative values and the grey areas are lands without snow cover the areas in blue are covered by snow with the swe amount increasing from light blue to dark blue the maps of both selected regions reveal that the sar and zi star models could capture variations of snowpack with higher accuracy than the other two models however for the areas with little snow cover and without snow cover the sar model is likely to be fitted incorrectly to negative values which do not exist in the real world 5 discussion 5 1 environmental factors for snowpack variations snowpack variations in the nh are explored by adding total snow mass in each grid from a satellite based swe product a slight but significant decreasing trend in the amount of snowpack has been reported in eurasia not only in march as discussed by pulliainen et al 2020 but also from october to february in a snow year potential factors are selected to investigate the environmental factor associations with snowpack variability thermal factors and consequent temperature factors including longwave radiation shortwave radiation air temperature land surface temperature day night and soil temperature still play leading roles with high absolute correlation coefficients on the hemispheric scale similar to regional studies bi et al 2015 notarnicola 2020 zhang et al 2021 zhong et al 2021a the strength of the associations of daytime land surface temperature is higher than that in the nighttime with snowpack variations and the shortwave radiation associations are higher than those for longwave radiation topographic factors such as elevation slope and roughness have similar associations to those reported for the altai mountains in china zhong et al 2021b but nearly no relation with aspect northness which is not consistent with the findings in this prior study this might be because the slope and aspect vary significantly in mountainous areas atmospheric water related factors have moderate negative correlations with snow mass similar to prior research qiao et al 2021 zhang et al 2019 however it needs further investigation about how these factors affect snowpack variation and whether the effects vary in snow accumulating and ablating process wind speed has little relation with snow which is different from regional studies in california s sierra nevada by haleakala et al 2021 this could be attributed to the types of snowfall affected by wind like blowing snow drifting snow and snow flurries which are unlikely to offer consistent effects at the continental scale as one of the factors having the strongest correlation with snowpack variations latitude is also highly correlated with other factors including the thermal and atmospheric factors in other words some of the interactions for snowpack and environmental factors are contributed from latitude the influence of vegetation cover on snowpack variation is also significant the reason is possibly associated with two aspects one is decreasing vegetation cover with increasing latitude on a hemispheric scale and the other is the effects from the forest canopies which would intercept radiation especially in forests in mid to high latitude areas andreadis et al 2009 based on exploring the strength of correlation of potential environmental factors for snow mass changes the variations of the contributions of the dominant factors have been further investigated together with the spatial and temporal effects that accompany the spatial distribution and periodic variations during snow years 5 2 variations of factors during snow accumulation and ablation period the results presented in tables 2 and 3 give a comparable quantitative analysis for the contribution of selected factors to the variations of the probability of snow coverage and the amount of snow mass on the land during accumulation and ablation periods it is obvious that air temperature still plays the leading role to identify whether snow exists and to simulate snow mass during accumulation and ablation the contribution of ground heat flux to snow mass is strong only during the snow ablation period the snow precipitation rate displays strong associations during the accumulation period but weaker associations during the ablation period the rain precipitation ratio effects vary in north america and eurasia rainfall would melt snow when the temperature above freezing but it will create a layer of ice on top of the snow if the surface temperature below freezing singh et al 1997 investigated that the rainfall rates alone have little effect to snowmelt but the impeding properties of the ice layers have more than doubled the storage capacity of the snowpack in the austrian alps regional rain on snow effects in the pacific northwest of the usa have been explored during the ablating period mazurkiewicz et al 2008 although the results of these regional mountainous studies does not apply to the swe dataset without mountainous area it is still referable in this study it is concluded that the impeding effect of ice layer for water storage capacity in snowpack is significant in north america moreover it is necessary to separate rain and snow from total precipitation due to their contrasting roles in snow evolution process and the interaction of rainfall and snow needs further exploration together with the effects of temperature gradients the influence of elevation is not as strong as that in prior regional studies especially in those station based observations but the trend is the same in both continents the effect of slope for snow mass is the same during accumulation period but vary during the ablation period and opposite in both processes for both continnets the elevation contributes more to snow mass variation during ablation in north america but for slope in eurasia however the topographic factors are weak in general mainly because of swe observations missing in mountainous areas which leads to less variations in terms of slope and elevation the effect of vegetation cover for snow existence is weak together with snow mass in north america but moderate during accumulation and strong during ablation for snow mass in eurasia sky water vapor contributes negatively to other processes but positively during snow ablation period in eurasia the interaction of water vapor and snow might exist in multiple processes for example preconditions together with cloud water content for snow formation ju et al 2013 absorbing and scattering solar radiation and terrestrial radiation including greenhouse effects and snow evolution including sublimation and evaporation after ablation heymsfield et al 2021 zhang et al 2019 it needs further investigation about when and which kind of the effects dominate snow mass variation during the process of snow evolution the influence of cloud water content during both periods and both continents are too small while taking the other dominant environmental factors into account the influence of wind speed is negative during accumulation and positive during ablation for both continents the results seem quite different than regional research of wind driven snow accumulation and ablation processes dadic et al 2010 mott et al 2018 wind could be engaged in multiple snow related processes including water vapor transmission types of snowfall like blowing snow and snowfall redistribution the wind effect varies with the spatial scale and extent therefore it is reasonable that the results would be quite different in this study due to the missing observations in mountainous areas together with the effects that accompany spatial scales 5 3 applicability of the zi star model regression is a typical statistical approach to investigate the contribution of explanatory variables to response variable s however strong spatial dependency presents in the geographical variables including swe and the environmental factors in this study which violates the hypothesis that the variables are independent and identically distributed anselin and griffith 1988 griffith and chun 2016 with the periodic variations for snowpack the correlation across time would have negligible influence when modelling with spatiotemporal dataset jiuliang and zhen 2013 qiao et al 2021 there are excessive zero observations on the land for the satellite retrieved swe products especially at the beginning of the snow accumulation and the end of the ablation periods in a snow year which would lead to potentially suboptimal analysis and interpretations the proposed zi star model takes spatial temporal and zero inflation effects in a two part model that divides the modelling with two processes the first determines whether snow accumulation occurs or not and the second simulates the specific values in areas where snow accumulate the performance of the zi star model has been compared with the time lag and sar models which takes at most one of the effects in this study using rmse r2 and aic for evaluating goodness of fit and residual mc values for checking whether spatial dependency effects have been taken into consideration the average r2 of time lag sar and zi star are 0 83 0 78 and 0 90 respectively the average rmse of the three models are 18 94 21 66 and 14 52 respectively the residuals mc values of zi star model have decreased close to the expectation of 1 n 1 the results show that zi star performs best among the three models with the highest accuracy and lowest randomly distributed residuals the model specification with two parts whether snow accumulated and how much swe accumulated once snow exists gives a clear and new picture to comprehend the swe accumulation and runoff process which can be used on hemispheric scale as well as regional and local scales if there are excessive zero values together with strong spatiotemporal effects in the distributions of the two factors although the origin of zeros is unclear and the zero observations is inconstant across periods the proposed zi star model could still capture the variation with greater performance for stable and reliable results the proposed zi star model also provides a feasible approach for spatiotemporal modeling for continuous variables with excessive zero observations in other geographic processes such as ecology modeling pollution detection analysis infectious disease mapping and so on 5 4 limitations this study identifies the dominant environmental factors associated with snow mass and investigated the variations of these factors in different periods however the influence of uncertainty accompanying the environmental factors were not considered the time lag effects are considered only for snowpack but not for the environmental factors which would have lead lag effects and even accumulating process like snow precipitation qiao et al 2021 although the swe product have been further corrected the results would vary with coarse spatial resolutions and the removal of mountainous areas another limitation for this study is that the results are limited to correlation and as such it remains difficult to clearly establish causation for the complex interaction for snow and the environmental factors based on this statistical approach in addition the spatial effects are only considered in the continuous parts a feasible spatial binary regression for large datasets could be included in future work 6 conclusion this study investigates snowpack variations and its associations with environmental factors in the nh during the period 2000 2018 using the proposed zi star model a significant decreasing trend is found for monthly total snow mass in eurasia from october to march and 26 potential satellite retrieved environmental factors were selected to explore correlations to snowpack changes thermal and atmospheric hydrological factors together with latitude and albedo have the strongest associations with the snow mass and seasonal effects are found to have critical influence to the strength of these associations a zi star model was proposed to investigate the contribution of dominant factors to snowpack variation for both the accumulation and ablation periods on the two continents with consideration of spatial temporal and zero inflation effects in the variables the zi star model performs best with an averaged r2 of 0 90 the r2 for the other models range from 0 69 to 0 84 and an average rmse of 14 52 mm 23 33 less than for the other models accompanied by residuals without spatial autocorrelation mc decreased from its peak of 0 50 to nearly 0 which reveals the need to consider space temporal effects for snow distribution and changes and the sequences of excessive number of zeros in satellite retrieved swe products based on zi star model air temperature and snow precipitation rate contribute much to the possibility of snow existence and snow mass variation the effect of rainfall on snow for water storage in snowpack are quite different in north america and eurasia and the interaction with temperature should be considered in detail for further study ground heat flux only contributes significantly to snow mass variation during the snow ablation period in both continents the influence of water vapor wind speed and topography have little effect due to the missing swe observations in mountainous areas the variations of the dominant factors are further discussed with the best performed zi star model which gives a new picture to comprehend snow accumulation and ablation period and the two processes of how affect the possibility of snow covered and how much snow mass by taking the spatial temporal and zero inflation effects into account together and lays the foundation for the prediction of snowpack in the nh and perhaps globally in the future in addition the proposed zi star model for continuous variable provide a feasible approach for other geographical spatiotemporal process modeling with
