11295,the world population is forecast to rise needing a remarkable increase in food production as agriculture is among the most water demanding sectors such augmentation could negatively affect water resource thus actions should be taken both to improve the water efficiency of current cropping systems and to seek alternative water sources for agriculture the improvement of water efficiency in agriculture has been long investigated soilless culture especially hydroponics is characterized by a particular attention to the water resource a different approach is represented by alternative water

consequently to ensure food security for the growing population actions should be taken both to improve the water efficiency of current cropping systems and to seek alternative water sources for agriculture the improvement of water efficiency in agriculture has been investigated for many years and consistent advances have been already made so far among others soilless culture where plants are

production sheikh 2006 interestingly hydroponics allows the saving of about 10 30 of water compared to soil cultivation also reducing the use of fertilizers and pesticides sheikh 2006 such a water saving can be achieved mainly because no water loss occurs when plants roots are in direct contact with the growing medium and because water for soil leaching is not needed therefore the water use

temperature for pots experiment with ph and ec values reported in table 2 2 2 water footprint assessment 2 2 1 blue hydroponics and sea hydroponics blue hydroponic and sea hydroponic wfs were empirically calculated using the following procedure plant biomass was recorded at the end of the experiment in particular fresh shoot weights were collected corresponding to the edible part of this species crop evapotraspiration et was recorded on a weekly basis by measuring the volume of solutions used by the crop it was assumed that no water loss apart from plant evapotranspiration occurred given that the experimental set up was a closed cycle hydroponic system after assessing that biomass production was not negatively affected by the seawater in the growing media atzori et al 2016 the wf was calculated as follows 1 wf et fwshoot where et is the total evapotranspiration during the crop cycle l and fwshoot is the fresh shoot biomass at harvest time or yield g the wf was divided in two components taking into account the origin of the water used in particular the components used in the current experiment were the blue water footprint hoekstra et al 2011 and what we define the seawater footprint for the blue water footprint calculation the irrigation tap water was taken into account whereas for the seawater footprint determination we considered the amount of seawater supplied to the crop during the whole cycle thus identifying this component only in the sea hydroponic growing systems the blue wf and the sea wf were determined as follows 2 blue wf etblue fwshoot 3 sea wf etseawater fwshoot where etblue is the total amount of fresh water used by the crop l etseawater is the total amount seawater consumed by the crop l and fwshoot is the fresh shoot biomass at harvest g 2 2 2 blue pots and sea pots blue pot and sea pot wfs were empirically calculated using the following procedure plants water consumption was recorded on a daily basis weighting samples along with the pot pot soil water plant moreover four destructive samplings were performed during the trial in order to record the fresh weight of the plants and use these values for the determination of crop evapotraspiration et as follows 4 et pwc1 pwc2 fw where et is the reintegration water share considering 100 pots water capacity pwc1 is the initial pots water capacity pot soil water pwc2 is the daily weight of pots pot soil water plant and fw the average plants fresh weight of the whole plant the wf and its components blue wf and sea wf were calculatedusing eqs 1 2 and 3 respectively 2 2 3 open field cultivation chicory s evapotranspiration et in open field cultivation was calculated using the food and agriculture organization cropwat model fao 2010b following the guidelines reported by hoekstra et al 2011 between the two options for calculating crop et the irrigation schedule option was chosen because of its higher accuracy climate data were obtained from fao s software climwat 2 0 for cropwat related to the following parameters location 23 florence altitude 51 m 43 76 n 11 25 e climwat 2 0 average minimum and maximum temperatures related to april may and june i e min temp 12 6 c and max temp 23 1 c did not remarkably differ from those of the greenhouse i e min temp 13 17 c and max temp 23 25 c both location and crop planting date parameters were chosen to correlate the model results with empirically obtained data according to the water footprint assessment manual hoekstra et al 2011 the crop wf was calculated as follows 5 wf et 10 y yield y data were obtained from the faostat database expressed in tons ha 1 2 3 statistical analyses the experimental setup related to the blue hydroponics and sea hydroponic growing systems and the one of the blue pot and sea pot growing systems were randomized several statistical tests were conducted to analyze the obtained data in particular one way anova with dunnett s post test analysis at p 0 05 was used to compare blue hydroponics sea hydroponics blue pots and sea pots water footprints calculated empirically with the open field estimated data considered as reference values this choice was made because the open field wf result is a numeric software output with no mean and error the comparisons among data related to blue hydroponics sea hydroponics blue pots and sea pots were analyzed with a one way anova and tukey s test p 0 05 along with this to assess eventual significant differences between the two soilless systems the results of blue hydroponics and sea hydroponics were also compared through a one way anova and t test p 0 05 all analyses were performed using graphpad prism 6 for windows 3 results and discussion the wf values obtained with the blue hydroponic sea hydroponic blue pot and sea pot systems and with cropwat model open field are reported in fig 1 results are presented in m3 ton 1 according to the water footprint assessment manual hoekstra et al 2011 significant differences were assessed between each cultivation system compared to the wf estimated for the open field exception made for the pot cultivation open field results are consistent with those reported by mekonnen and hoekstra 2010 related to the chicory production in the tuscany region and the non significance between open field and pots wf helps us validating the pot cultivation as a similar cultivation system compared to open field conditions in terms of biomass production and water consumption regarding the three other systems sea pot was the worst performing in terms of wf with an increase of 104 compared to open field cultivation as better explained later on such result is mainly due to poor biomass production obtained in such system rather than to increasing water consumption on the contrary both blue hydroponic and sea hydroponic systems showed a significant reduction in wf i e 64 and of 75 respectively compared to open field cultivation limiting the comparison to the two systems with the lowest wfs the t test revealed significant differences with the sea hydroponics achieving a water footprint reduction of 29 5 compared to conventional blue hydroponics thus providing the best result in terms of food production and water saving table 3 the results obtained in hydroponic conditions confirmed the increased water use efficiency of hydroponics growing systems compared to soil cultivation interestingly the sea hydroponics showed the best performances in water saving and not at a cost of biomass production in fact as reported in fig 2 the blue hydroponics and sea hydroponics biomass production were comparable thus seawater in the sea hydroponics growing media did not negatively affect the plants growth this is consistent with the results obtained in an experiment testing the salinity tolerance of chicory cv puna in hydroponic conditions no significant differences in biomass production were observed between the 50 mmol l 1 nacl treatment corresponding to ec of 7 1 ds m 1 slightly superior of the ec of the sea hydroponics treatment of our experiment and control plants boyd and rogers 2004 these results suggest that hydroponics allows the tested crop to tolerate a higher salinity threshold compared to soil cultivation reasons can be found in the enhanced roots oxygenation in hydroponic conditions which was proved to help plants in withstanding the osmotic pressure due to the salinity stress raviv and lieth 2008 this result is particularly important because the best opportunity for water efficiency improvement is to fill the gap between yield and water use performance mateos and araus 2016 although replacing 10 of the irrigation water with seawater may represent a limited solution to the freshwater scarcity issue on a large scale hydroponics production this same percentage becomes remarkable moreover several other crops might be grown with an even higher share of seawater not resulting in negative yield productions while limiting freshwater use several crops in fact proved to be resistant to higher shares of seawater i e the chard crop biomass production was not negatively affected up to 15 seawater corresponding to ec of 9 2 ds m 1 atzori et al 2016 and tomato crop was competitive to freshwater production up to 12 seawater corresponding to ec of 10 ds m 1 sgherri et al 2008 also many other crops have not been tested yet as the majority of trials investigating crops salt resistance are carried out with nacl treatments and not with seawater interestingly seawater in the growing media implies for certain crops the nutritive improvement of the edible product certain plants secondary metabolites are in fact accumulated in response to stress conditions as an adaptation to the environment ramakrishna and ravishankar 2011 for instance anthocyanins polyphenols and proline concentrations in some crops are known to increase with salinity parida and das 2005 thereby resulting in enhanced nutritional properties of food sgherri et al 2008 di baccio et al 2004 accordingly salinity in some cases may result to be favorable for yield and its quality shannon and grieve 1998 fig 2 also reports the yield performances in blue pot and sea pot growing systems whilst the yield of blue pots is comparable to soilless systems sea pot growth performances were significantly lower nevertheless as the 10 seawater lead to very different results in both sea hydroponics and sea pot systems it can be speculated that seawater was not the only reason for the sea pot growth performance with no proper leaching occurring salinity in soil tends to increase over time in fact leaching represents the best strategy to maintain favorable salt balance and prevent detrimental salt accumulation in the soil profile sanchez and silvertooth 1996 on the other hand in hydroponics as mentioned before plants salt tolerance is on average higher because the constant oxygenation of the root system helps excluding toxic ions i e na and thus withstanding the high osmotic pressure of the growing medium raviv and lieth 2008 therefore the combination of such poor results in sea pot biomass production and the detrimental effects of salinity on soil makes the option of soil cropping with seawater unrealistic unless the soil is already degraded in addition as it is known that seawater in soil would negatively affect its structure and contaminate its fertility through ca2 na exchange and consequent clay dispersion ventura et al 2015 its deliberate introduction as irrigation source in soil would present numerous environmental concerns on the contrary the use of seawater in soilless culture could reduce without any negative input into soils the freshwater withdrawal dedicated to food production as expected the two soilless systems are the ones characterized by the lower water consumption with sea hydroponics showing the lowest value even compared to blue hydroponics fig 3 also sea pots recorded lower water consumptions compared to blue pots although the presence of seawater in the irrigation water led to two very different results with plants growing performances remarkably different as just discussed in both sea hydroponics and sea pots plants water consumption was significantly reduced compared to their respective non salt conditions such decreases can be explained by the fact that salt stressed plants suffer changed cell water relations and display a cost for osmotic adjustment which generally reduce the absorption and translocation of water munns 2002 probably because of a reduction of leaf stomatal conductance nevertheless the high water use efficiency of sea hydroponics led to a biomass production comparable to the non salinity conditions whereas in sea pots the biomass production dropped in fig 4 the wf components taking into account the water provenience are presented in particular the components used in our experiment are the blue water footprint and what we define seawater footprint comparing the different cropping systems with a special focus on water saving the sea pots and the sea hydroponics have the advantage of substituting a share of the blue water with seawater the water considered in the blue wf is easily accessible and portable so that it can be taken out restrained measured distributed and stored antonelli and greco 2013 and according to the different countries it can have a cost according to fao estimates 70 of this water is destined to worldwide irrigation fao 2011 on the other hand seawater is free abundant and not in any danger of overexploitation of course its use can be suggested in coastal areas only or its transportation would reach an environmental cost superior of the saving of water besides the great majority of the global population resides in coastal areas and seawater could then contribute to the water saving goal of course being production the first goal based on our result it is the sea hydroponics cultivation system that shows a potential although further investigations comparing the water footprint and the carbon footprint of these growing systems might be interesting in order to analyze the growing systems efficiency and their costs on the environment from a comprehensive perspective these results suggest a realistic advantage in saving water without productive nor environmental disadvantages by using a share of seawater in hydroponics acknowledgments we gratefully acknowledge pnat and the jellyfish barge project for inspiring this research this study was

empirically calculated using the following procedure plant biomass was recorded at the end of the experiment in particular fresh shoot weights were collected corresponding to the edible part of this species crop evapotraspiration et was recorded on a weekly basis by measuring the volume of solutions used by the crop it was assumed that no water loss apart from plant evapotranspiration occurred given that the experimental set up was a closed cycle hydroponic system after assessing that biomass production was not negatively affected by the seawater in the growing media atzori et al 2016 the wf was calculated as follows 1 wf et fwshoot where et is the total evapotranspiration during the crop cycle l and fwshoot is the fresh shoot biomass at harvest time or yield g the wf was divided in two components taking into account the origin of the water used in particular the components used in the current experiment were the blue water footprint hoekstra et al 2011 and what we define the seawater footprint for the blue water footprint calculation the irrigation tap water was taken into account whereas for the seawater footprint determination we considered the amount of seawater supplied to the crop during the whole cycle thus identifying this component only in the sea hydroponic growing systems the blue wf and the sea wf were determined as follows 2 blue wf etblue fwshoot 3 sea wf etseawater fwshoot where etblue is the total amount of fresh water used by the crop l etseawater is the total amount seawater consumed by the crop l and fwshoot is the fresh shoot biomass at harvest g 2 2 2 blue pots and sea pots blue pot and sea pot wfs were empirically calculated using the following procedure plants water consumption was recorded on a daily basis weighting samples along with the pot pot soil water plant moreover four destructive samplings were performed during the trial in order to record the fresh weight of the plants and use these values for the determination of crop evapotraspiration et as follows 4 et pwc1 pwc2 fw where et is the reintegration water share considering 100 pots water capacity pwc1 is the initial pots water capacity pot soil water pwc2 is the daily weight of pots pot soil water plant and fw the average plants fresh weight of the whole plant the wf and its components blue wf and sea wf were calculatedusing eqs 1 2 and 3 respectively 2 2 3 open field cultivation chicory s evapotranspiration et in open field cultivation was calculated using the food and agriculture organization cropwat model fao 2010b following the guidelines reported by hoekstra et al 2011 between the two options for calculating crop et the irrigation schedule option was chosen because of its higher accuracy climate data were obtained from fao s software climwat 2 0 for cropwat related to the following parameters location 23 florence altitude 51 m 43 76 n 11 25 e climwat 2 0 average minimum and maximum temperatures related to april may and june i e min temp 12 6 c and max temp 23 1 c did not remarkably differ from those of the greenhouse i e min temp 13 17 c and max temp 23 25 c both location and crop planting date parameters were chosen to correlate the model results with empirically obtained data according to the water footprint assessment manual hoekstra et al 2011 the crop wf was calculated as follows 5 wf et 10 y yield y data were obtained from the faostat database expressed in tons ha 1 2 3 statistical analyses the experimental setup related to the blue hydroponics and sea hydroponic growing systems and the one of the blue pot and sea pot growing systems were randomized several statistical tests were conducted to analyze the obtained data in particular one way anova with dunnett s post test analysis at p 0 05 was used to compare blue hydroponics sea hydroponics blue pots and sea pots water footprints calculated empirically with the open field estimated data considered as reference values this choice was made because the open field wf result is a numeric software output with no mean and error the comparisons among data related to blue hydroponics sea hydroponics blue pots and sea pots were analyzed with a one way anova and tukey s test p 0 05 along with this to assess eventual significant differences between the two soilless systems the results of blue hydroponics and sea hydroponics were also compared through a one way anova and t test p 0 05 all analyses were performed using graphpad prism 6 for windows 3 results and discussion the wf values obtained with the blue hydroponic sea hydroponic blue pot and sea pot systems and with cropwat model open field are reported in fig 1 results are presented in m3 ton 1 according to the water footprint assessment manual hoekstra et al 2011 significant differences were assessed between each cultivation system compared to the wf estimated for the open field exception made for the pot cultivation open field results are consistent with those reported by mekonnen and hoekstra 2010 related to the chicory production in the tuscany region and the non significance between open field and pots wf helps us validating the pot cultivation as a similar cultivation system compared to open field conditions in terms of biomass production and water consumption regarding the three other systems sea pot was the worst performing in terms of wf with an increase of 104 compared to open field cultivation as better explained later on such result is mainly due to poor biomass production obtained in such system rather than to increasing water consumption on the contrary both blue hydroponic and sea hydroponic systems showed a significant reduction in wf i e 64 and of 75 respectively compared to open field cultivation limiting the comparison to the two systems with the lowest wfs the t test revealed significant differences with the sea hydroponics achieving a water footprint reduction of 29 5 compared to conventional blue hydroponics thus providing the best result in terms of food production and water saving table 3 the results obtained in hydroponic conditions confirmed the increased water use efficiency of hydroponics growing systems compared to soil cultivation interestingly the sea hydroponics showed the best performances in water saving and not at a cost of biomass production in fact as reported in fig 2 the blue hydroponics and sea hydroponics biomass production were comparable thus seawater in the sea hydroponics growing media did not negatively affect the plants growth this is consistent with the results obtained in an experiment testing the salinity tolerance of chicory cv puna in hydroponic conditions no significant differences in biomass production were observed between the 50 mmol l 1 nacl treatment corresponding to ec of 7 1 ds m 1 slightly superior of the ec of the sea hydroponics treatment of our experiment and control plants boyd and rogers 2004 these results suggest that hydroponics allows the tested crop to tolerate a higher salinity threshold compared to soil cultivation reasons can be found in the enhanced roots oxygenation in hydroponic conditions which was proved to help plants in withstanding the osmotic pressure due to the salinity stress raviv and lieth 2008 this result is particularly important because the best opportunity for water efficiency improvement is to fill the gap between yield and water use performance mateos and araus 2016 although replacing 10 of the irrigation water with seawater may represent a limited solution to the freshwater scarcity issue on a large scale hydroponics production this same percentage becomes remarkable moreover several other crops might be grown with an even higher share of seawater not resulting in negative yield productions while limiting freshwater use several crops in fact proved to be resistant to higher shares of seawater i e the chard crop biomass production was not negatively affected up to 15 seawater corresponding to ec of 9 2 ds m 1 atzori et al 2016 and tomato crop was competitive to freshwater production up to 12 seawater corresponding to ec of 10 ds m 1 sgherri et al 2008 also many other crops have not been tested yet as the majority of trials investigating crops salt resistance are carried out with nacl treatments and not with seawater interestingly seawater in the growing media implies for certain crops the nutritive improvement of the edible product certain plants secondary metabolites are in fact accumulated in response to stress conditions as an adaptation to the environment ramakrishna and ravishankar 2011 for instance anthocyanins polyphenols and proline concentrations in some crops are known to increase with salinity parida and das 2005 thereby resulting in enhanced nutritional properties of food sgherri et al 2008 di baccio et al 2004 accordingly salinity in some cases may result to be favorable for yield and its quality shannon and grieve 1998 fig 2 also reports the yield performances in blue pot and sea pot growing systems whilst the yield of blue pots is comparable to soilless systems sea pot growth performances were significantly lower nevertheless as the 10 seawater lead to very different results in both sea hydroponics and sea pot systems it can be speculated that seawater was not the only reason for the sea pot growth performance with no proper leaching occurring salinity in soil tends to increase over time in fact leaching represents the best strategy to maintain favorable salt balance and prevent detrimental salt accumulation in the soil profile sanchez and silvertooth 1996 on the other hand in hydroponics as mentioned before plants salt tolerance is on average higher because the constant oxygenation of the root system helps excluding toxic ions i e na and thus withstanding the high osmotic pressure of the growing medium raviv and lieth 2008 therefore the combination of such poor results in sea pot biomass production and the detrimental effects of salinity on soil makes the option of soil cropping with seawater unrealistic unless the soil is already degraded in addition as it is known that seawater in soil would negatively affect its structure and contaminate its fertility through ca2 na exchange and consequent clay dispersion ventura et al 2015 its deliberate introduction as irrigation source in soil would present numerous environmental concerns on the contrary the use of seawater in soilless culture could reduce without any negative input into soils the freshwater withdrawal dedicated to food production as expected the two soilless systems are the ones characterized by the lower water consumption with sea hydroponics showing the lowest value even compared to blue hydroponics fig 3 also sea pots recorded lower water consumptions compared to blue pots although the presence of seawater in the irrigation water led to two very different results with plants growing performances remarkably different as just discussed in both sea hydroponics and sea pots plants water consumption was significantly reduced compared to their respective non salt conditions such decreases can be explained by the fact that salt stressed plants suffer changed cell water relations and display a cost for osmotic adjustment which generally reduce the absorption and translocation of water munns 2002 probably because of a reduction of leaf stomatal conductance nevertheless the high water use efficiency of sea hydroponics led to a biomass production comparable to the non salinity conditions whereas in sea pots the biomass production dropped in fig 4 the wf components taking into account the water provenience are presented in particular the components used in our experiment are the blue water footprint and what we define seawater footprint comparing the different cropping systems with a special focus on water saving the sea pots and the sea hydroponics have the advantage of substituting a share of the blue water with seawater the water considered in the blue wf is easily accessible and portable so that it can be taken out restrained measured distributed and stored antonelli and greco 2013 and according to the different countries it can have a cost according to fao estimates 70 of this water is destined to worldwide irrigation fao 2011 on the other hand seawater is free abundant and not in any danger of overexploitation of course its use can be suggested in coastal areas only or its transportation would reach an environmental cost superior of the saving of water besides the great majority of the global population resides in coastal areas and seawater could then contribute to the water saving goal of course being production the first goal based on our result it is the sea hydroponics cultivation system that shows a potential although further investigations comparing the water footprint and the carbon footprint of these growing systems might be interesting in order to analyze the growing systems efficiency and their costs on the environment from a comprehensive perspective these results suggest a realistic advantage in saving water without productive nor environmental disadvantages by using a share of seawater in hydroponics acknowledgments we gratefully acknowledge pnat and the jellyfish barge project for inspiring this research this study was

11296,optimized irrigation scheduling to better match applied water to crop requirements can reduce the consumptive use of water and energy improve water use efficiency and increase gross profit margin however the distribution uniformity of applied irrigation can modify the way reduced water applications influence field averaged performance especially for crops sensitive to water stress as maize in which the most sensitive stages are those related with reproduction and grain formation we evaluated the effect of irrigation uniformity on the yield and profitability of maize zea mays l in albacete spain in two adjacent sectors equipped with a solid set sprinkler irrigation system of a field managed according to fao 56 methodology throughout the growing season to maximize grain yield without water stress sector s1 or irrigation scheduling determined by an experienced producer sector s2 irrigation uniformity was evaluated using catch cans in both fields and grain yield was harvested within zones exhibiting 75 z1 100 z2 and 125 z3 of area averaged volume applications throughout the year the average coefficient of uniformity cu in both sectors s1 and s2 was 83 5 and the net amount of applied irrigation water totaled 709 mm in s1 and 832 mm in s2 average grain yield in sector s2 approached the maximum expected yield of 18 4 mg ha 1 and exhibited no significant differences in yield among zones in contrast sector s1 exhibited significant yield differences p 0 05 among zones with a measured yield in z3 of 18 5 mg ha 1 and a yield reduction of 1 6 mg ha 1 and 4 0 mg ha 1 in z2 and z1 respectively consequently the area averaged yield in s1 was 8 less than in s2 this last treatment was positively influenced by a higher amount of irrigation water supplied to the crop 17 which decreased the effect of low cu 83 5 the grain yields simulated by mopeco for each monitoring zone within the sectors exhibited similar magnitude and trends because of these yield differences and the relatively low cost of irrigation water area averaged gross margin in s1 was 18 less compared with s2 simulations with mopeco over a range of cu s demonstrated that improved irrigation uniformity increased area averaged yields and gross margin when following s1 instead of s2 strategy the main innovations of this work were to quantify the effect of irrigation uniformity on the gross margin of a maize crop and to highlight that in arid and semiarid areas with water scarce conditions it is a better strategy to improve the irrigation uniformity than supply a higher amount of irrigation water to mask the lack of uniformity keywords irrigation scheduling solid set sprinkler irrigation system crop modeling mopeco energy saving water saving 1 introduction increasing world population risks of floods and droughts associated with climate change and demands for fresh water for urban and environmental services are leading to a decline in water resources available for agriculture fallon and betts 2010 this calls for an improvement in the efficiency and productivity of water used in agriculture to ensure sustainable production of food and fiber improvements in the application efficiency of irrigation water within the framework of precision farming is one approach that has the potential to increase productivity yet reduce the environmental impact of irrigated agriculture monaghan et al 2013 smith et al 2010 smith et al 2010 proposed that a precision irrigation system permits i the determination of the time amount and spatial pattern of the next irrigation water application to maximize yield water use efficiency or profitability ii the regulation of the applied volume as close as possible to what is recommended iii the estimation of the magnitude and spatial pattern of the irrigation applications based on direct measurements or simulations and iv uses these responses as feedback to plan the next irrigation improving the use of water energy and production practices therefore requires a holistic approach using tools and models that consider all the factors that influence crop response among others tools such as dssat csm jones et al 2003 or isareg pereira et al 2003 can facilitate water savings and the elaboration of farm level cropping strategies with the objective of maximizing the productivity of water and minimizing environmental impacts however these models do not take into account the uniformity of irrigation in their simulations the lack of uniformity may cause the decrease of yield in the areas of the plot receiving a lower amount of water consequently this effect decreases the water and economic productivity lópez mata et al 2010 castilla la mancha fig 1 is a semiarid region of spain which depends on groundwater resources for irrigation the increasing price of the energy required for pumping water from the aquifers and the use of pressurized irrigation systems make necessary the use of decision making tools that incorporate pumping and energy costs into water management to optimize profitability mopeco ortega et al 2004 model for the economical optimization of irrigation water has been calibrated for the principal crops cultivated over the eastern mancha aquifer fig 1 maize barley wheat onion and garlic using data from full and deficit irrigated field studies yield curves as a function of applied irrigation depths for distinct years are determined for a typical meteorological year domínguez et al 2013 generated using historical climate data and the use of regulated deficit irrigation optimized for each crop growth stage ordi domínguez et al 2012b depending on the irrigated area and the total water available for each application as well as economic data associated with the farm and selected crops mopeco helps determine the planted acreage and the level of deficit irrigation applied at each crop growth stage for each crop to maximize farm profitability moreover when the irrigation uniformity is lower than 100 its effect on crop yield can be considered during the irrigation scheduling by using the coefficient of uniformity module developed for mopeco mopeco cu by lópez mata et al 2010 the objectives of this work are to i evaluate the effect of the uniformity of sprinkler irrigation applications on the yield and economic profitability of maize using two irrigation scheduling management in the semiarid environment and soils of the eastern mancha aquifer in the province of albacete spain and ii utilize mopeco to simulate the effect of the uniformity of irrigation applications and determine suitable irrigation strategies for maize cultivation in the zone in relation to pumping and delivery costs of water 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was carried out during the 2016 growing season in a field within a collective irrigation network with managed allocations located in aguas nuevas albacete in castilla la mancha region spain 38 52 59 n 1 57 39 w the irrigated area lies within the hydrogeological unit eastern mancha huem that occupies an area of 8500 km2 fig 1 and supplies irrigation to more than 110 000 ha 95 of which are pressurized systems principally solid set sprinkler and surface drip with an average annual water allocation of 4000 m3 ha 1 jcrmo 2016 the study area has a semiarid and temperate mediterranean climate papadakis 1966 the average daily maximum temperature is attained during the summer 33 c with a large seasonal variability in mean daily temperatures 3 8 c in january and 24 4 c in july the mean annual precipitation is 360 mm principally concentrated in the autumn and spring months and mean cumulative annual reference evapotranspiration eto is 1300 mm the soil within the field site is very uniform and is classified usda 2006 as a torriorthent with a petrocalcic horizon at a depth of 0 4 to 0 6 m and a clay loam in the upper horizon 300 g kg 1 clay and 350 g kg 1 sand with low to medium levels of soil organic matter according to the soil and water analysis no salinization problems were detected the amount of fertilizers applied to the crop was the typical in the area 300 kg ha 1 of diammonium phosphate 18 46 0 in seeding 200 kg ha 1 of urea n 46 in june and 70 kg ha 1 of nitrogen solution n 32 in july the study site consisted of a 2 9 ha level field with two irrigation sectors of equal area which were independently irrigated the portion of the plot receiving irrigation water from both sectors was considered as border between the two treatments the field was equipped with a fixed solid set sprinkler irrigation system with buried laterals and sprinkler heads spaced 17 3 14 7 m each sector was comprised of 72 sprinklers distributed along six laterals with twelve sprinklers per lateral each tied to the submain at the center of each lateral to permit good application uniformity impact sprinkler heads agro 35 cometal inc albacete spain consisted of a single nozzle of diameter 5 2 mm and were mounted at a height of 2 3 m above the soil surface level at the beginning of the study two evaluations per sector were carried out on may 19th and june 2nd to characterize the spatial distribution of the irrigation system and obtain the data necessary for irrigation scheduling operational pressure average application rate and cu both evaluations were carried out in the area defined by four specific sprinklers 9 10 16 and 17 which correspond with the average pressure of the sector fig 2 evaluations started at 6 a m and finished at 9 a m in order to reach low wind speeds average of 0 8 and 1 0 m s 1 respectively 30 catch cans of 0 16 m of diameter and 0 15 m of height at a spacing of 2 9 2 9 m were used for collecting the irrigation water later these areas were used to control the soil moisture progression and to take the harvest samples the methodology proposed by merriam and keller 1978 was used for these assessments taking into account the established standards iso 7749 2 1990 as well as the american standards asae s330 1 2003 the field was planted to a late maturing fao 700 maize zea mays l cultivar antiss limagrain elorz navarre spain characterized by a high yield potential the crop was planted on april 18th 2016 in 0 70 m rows at a population of 85 000 plants ha 1 and subsequently managed according to cultural practices customarily used in the region 2 2 irrigation scheduling having into account the results of the irrigation uniformity evaluation two irrigation strategies were applied in the two sectors during the study irrigation in sector 1 s1 was scheduled based on the simplified water balance in the soil proposed by fao 56 allen et al 1998 by using the maize crop parameters determined by domínguez et al 2012a in the area the objective was to apply the irrigation requirements of the crop for avoiding water stress in the zones of the plot receiving the average amount of irrigation water applied by the system irrigation in sector 2 s2 was determined by the farmer according to his experience during the irrigation of maize in this area for more than 15 years because the field is within a collective irrigation network with managed allocations the producer is only able to irrigate two days a week for this study all irrigation applications were completed during the night with a maximum duration of four hours for both sectors and within the eight hour time window in which the cost of electric consumption is at its lowest reference evapotranspiration allen et al 1998 was determined using weather data collected from a nearby automated agrometeorological station http eportal magrama gob es websiar inicio aspx located 5 km in a large level area with uniform vegetation the weather station is located in an experimental farm over a natural vegetation surface frequently sprinkler irrigated surrounded by fields of crops full irrigated during the summer months precipitation was monitored using a rain gage located at the field site and effective precipitation was estimated with the usda methodology where the hydrological soil group was iii slope 3 conditions for infiltration were good and labors followed more or less the slope lines which implies a curve number equal to 80 scs 1972 nrcs 2004 the crop coefficients kc for each crop development stage developed by domínguez et al 2012a for maize in the region table 1 were used to calculate evapotranspiration without crop water stress etm the duration of each growth stage and associated kc was determined by monitoring on a weekly basis the phenology of the maize in the field plots according to the bbch scale bleiholder et al 2001 the durations of the stages were translated into cumulative growing degree days using the double triangle method sevacherian et al 1977 and were compared with those obtained by domínguez et al 2012a for this cultivar in the region under water stress conditions mopeco calculates actual crop evapotranspiration eta by using the methodology proposed by allen et al 1998 the required daily soil water balance for determining eta is described in domínguez et al 2011 which is also based on fao 56 methodology allen et al 1998 2 3 grain yield estimation with mopeco the mopeco model uses the equation proposed by stewart et al 1977 to estimate grain yield based on the ratio of the actual crop evapotranspiration eta to etm at each of the crop growth stages the determination of the daily eta requires the simulation of the daily progression of moisture content in the root zone thus when eta etm the plant undergoes water stress that results in a decrease in actual grain yield ya that is less than or equal to the potential yield obtained under conditions of no water stress ym 1 y a y m j 1

conditions nutrients or water availability or others this value was fitted for the cultivar used in this experiment the traditional management of the crop in the area and for the climatic conditions in the study year 2 4 soil moisture sensors and operating pressures of the irrigation system to verify that the irrigation schedule determined by mopeco was suitable for avoiding soil water depletion two pairs of watermark sensors irrometer corp riverside ca usa were installed at 0 2 and 0 4 m in sector s1 and located in zone 2 used as reference for irrigation scheduling in s1 near where hand harvested samples were collected fig 2 sensors were connected to am 400 hansen integrators irrometer corp riverside ca usa to acquire mean voltage values over eight hour intervals to yield three measurements per day a pressure transducer druck leicester uk previously calibrated over a range of 0 6 bars was installed to monitor irrigation applications in both sectors during the study the transducer was installed in a line just prior to the sprinkler head that represented the average operating pressure of the irrigation system relative to the control area of the remaining the transducer was installed at a height of 1 m above the soil surface such that the upstream and downstream distances were greater than 10 times the pipe diameter iso 15886 3 2012 to provide stable pressure measurements pressure measurements were recorded at two minute intervals and permitted the determination of the start and end of each irrigation event the pressure variation during each irrigation and the application volume based on the pressure flow relationship determined from evaluations of this irrigation system because the irrigation system is within a cooperative with coordinated scheduling slight variations in pressure may occur and result in differences in applied volumes for each irrigation the general sprinkler equation is expressed as eq 2 keller and bliesner 1990 2 q k h 0 5 where q emission rate k emission coefficient 0 5 emission exponent h inlet pressure head of the sprinkler therefore the actual application depth da mm for each irrigation was calculated as 3 d a p m d t r p r p e 0 5 where pmd is the mean irrigation intensity mm h 1 obtained from recorded depths in catch gages during the day of the evaluation pr is the mean pressure during the irrigation event kpa pe is the mean pressure kpa during the evaluation and tr is the application time of the irrigation event h 2 5 grain yield analysis maize grain yield was determined by hand harvesting a representative sample at physiological maturity in small subplots 1 4 m 2 m length at three locations z1 z2 z3 within each sector with two subplot replications per location fig 2 in each plot replication the number of plants and ears height of five plants ear mass and length dry grain mass mass 100 dry kernels and dry 70 c above ground biomass were determined analysis of variance anova was carried out using statgraphics to evaluate the location effect on grain yield noting that at each location a different level of irrigation was received because of unequal uniformity of application separation of means was completed using fisher s protected lsd method with p values less than 0 05 declared as significant 2 6 effect of irrigation uniformity on grain yield and gross margin to obtain a first level approximation of the effect of irrigation uniformity on field scale grain yield and gross margin three areas within each of the sectors were identified for harvest sampling and further analysis in sector 1 these areas established based on the distribution of applied net irrigation in from two evaluations were z1 representative of approximately 25 less irrigation than the field average 0 75 in z2 representative of the approximate field average in and z3 representative of approximately 25 greater than the field average 1 25 in in sector 2 these areas were selected in the same manner to analyse the effect of irrigation volume and uniformity on grain yield and gross margin two scenarios were considered first one scenario a1 by using the simulation model mopeco which had into account the uniformity of water applied by the irrigation system in the crop yield mopeco cu second one scenario a2 by using the classical concept of application efficiency for the irrigation system scenario a1 each irrigation event was divided into m 25 realizations with differing application depths assuming that distribution of irrigation application depths across the surface have a normal distribution with a mean value equal to the field average net application depths and a coefficient of uniformity cu measured during the two evaluations christiansen 1942 as all irrigation events were at night and with low wind velocities average of 1 6 m s 1 it was further assumed that there was no significant lateral redistribution of soil water during infiltration and the resultant increase in available soil water reflect net application depths with a normal distribution associated with the measured cu keller and bliesner 1990 for each of the realizations daily soil water balance was calculated throughout the growing season and the resultant grain yield was simulated using mopeco cu with the field scale yield obtained through integration of the 25 subplots scenario a2 the average net irrigation in the field was calculated from the average gross water depth applied by the irrigation system ig multiplied by the application efficiency epa the average gross irrigation rate was based on 8 5 mm h 1 and corrected using eq 3 to account for the actual pressure during each irrigation application efficiency was estimated using the procedures established by keller and bliesner 1990 as 4 e p a d e p a r e where depa is the distribution efficiency for the desired percentage area that is adequately irrigated pa and re is the average fraction of ig that reaches the soil surface this scenario leads to a smaller quantity of net water applied for the same gross application rate by the irrigation system which represents the standard conditions normally considered in irrigation management the average field scale yield of the crop was subsequently determined with mopeco using the effective precipitation plus the irrigation application depths determined as e pa ig and assumed to be uniform throughout the sector 2 7 evaluation of production costs the production costs of the crop were calculated using the labor fertilizer and other raw material inputs as well as the costs associated with irrigation that were supplied by the producer according to de juan et al 2003 the costs can be classified as a external costs associated with the costs of seed fertilizer pesticides and water including energy cost b calculated costs related to labor and machinery and c estimated costs of crop insurance and machinery rental table 2 revenues from crop sales were calculated using the information facilitated by the producer related to the sale price kg 1 and the grain yield obtained from the harvest kg ha 1 and estimated cap common agricultural policy of the european union subsidies the effect of distinct irrigation management practices in sectors s1 and s2 was evaluated using the following indicators relative to the irrigation volume and the production and financial efficiencies a relative water supply rws describes the relationship between the amount of water used and that estimated as necessary for production levine 1982 and calculated as 5 r w s i g p e e t m where ig is the gross applied irrigation m3 ha 1 including the difference between the water available in the soil at sowing and at harvest pe is effective

rws 115 irrigation is considered excessive whereas if 85 rws 115 the crop is considered well watered however if rws 85 irrigation is considered insufficient b relative irrigation supply ris describes the relation between the gross irrigation supply ig and the volume of irrigation water necessary to avoid an undesirable stress throughout the crop growth cycle etm pe molden et al 1998 6 r i s i g e

poor spatial uniformity of the water within the farm untimely distribution of precipitation within the growing season and imprecise irrigation scheduling c production index pi defined by bos et al 1994 relates the actual yield ya to the maximum achievable yield by the crop ym 7 p i y a y m the actual yield in z1 z2 y z3 was hand sampled in the study plot and combine yields were also obtained by

rate of the sprinkler heads was 8 5 mm h 1 and the mean volume of water collected from the 30 catch cans fig 2 resulted in an effective application rate of 8 0 mm h 1 and an average fraction of ig that reaches the soil surface re 0 94 8 0 8 5 because measured pressure fluctuations during irrigations were more pronounced during the season compared with the two evaluations resulting in a lower mean pressure the estimated mean effective application rate for the entire season was estimated to be 7 5 mm h 1 based on the pressure flow relationship of eq 4 the uniformity coefficients cu calculated for the two evaluations were 83 8 s1 and 83 3 s2 and averaged 83 5 this value 83 85 is considered to be the limit of what is acceptable for individual irrigations with low wind velocities keller and bliesner 1990 ortiz et al 2010 tarjuelo et al 1999 but this limit is not clearly identified for this reason this work aims to quantify the effect of sprinkler irrigation uniformity although more field trials are needed to identify this limit in different types of soil crops and irrigation systems in this sense the mopeco cu model may offer an approximation the mean volumes of water collected in the two evaluations carried during the initial part of the study demonstrated that catch cans located in the vicinity of the sprinklers received less irrigation fig 3 with the central area distant from sprinkler head receiving a greater proportion of water this is a characteristic distribution obtained when the sprinkler heads consist of a single nozzle tarjuelo et al 1999 given that all irrigations were carried out during the nighttime and with low wind velocities it is reasonable to assume that distributions were similar for other irrigation events throughout the growing season and that this had a cumulative effect of less water being applied in the vicinity of the sprinkler heads thereby affecting the sampled yield in this zone as indicated in the methodology the three zones z1 z2 and z3 in each sector were identified fig 3 establishing plots in such a manner to permit the evaluation of the crop behavior with distinct levels of applied net irrigation consequently net irrigation applied at a nozzle pressure of 4 6 bars was estimated to be 6 3 mm h 1 8 0 mm h 1 and 10 5 mm h 1 for zones z1 z2 and z3 respectively based on the data collected during the evaluations with the objective of improving the distribution uniformity of applied irrigation a third evaluation of the irrigation system within the study field was carried out after maize harvest with the same conditions as the previous two evaluations except for the use of sprinkler heads with two nozzles 4 8 and 2 4 mm with an operating pressure during the evaluation of 4 6 bars the mean application rate of the sprinkler heads was 9 0 mm h 1 and the mean volume of water collected from the 30 catch cans fig 2 resulted in an effective application rate of 8 8 mm h 1 the coefficient of uniformity for this evaluation was 90 which indicates a significant improvement in the distribution of water compared with cu 83 5 obtained with a single nozzle during this evaluation which took place at dawn the maximum wind velocity was 1 8 m s 1 3 2 irrigation scheduling since the objective is evaluating the effect of the uniformity of sprinkler irrigation applications on the yield and economic profitability it is important to analyses the irrigation scheduling in the two sectors s1 and s2 the depth of irrigation applied in each event was estimated based on the average working pressure measured by the transducer fig 4 irrigation was applied during the nighttime under conditions of low wind velocity with an average value of 1 6 m s 1 and a maximum of 3 8 m s 1 fig 5 the relatively low wind velocities reflect minor influence of wind on the distribution of water noting that once the wind exceeds a value of 2 m s 1 it can modify the uniformity of water distribution tarjuelo et al 1999 based on the evaluation data we estimated drift and evaporation losses to be 6 which are the same order of magnitude that are obtained in previous studies in the region under similar conditions ortiz et al 2009 tarjuelo et al 2000 the scheduling of irrigation was updated weekly using weather data and the progression of observed crop phenology during the entire growing season 753 5 mm of gross irrigation were applied in sector s1 and 884 4 mm in s2 that is a volume 17 greater than determined with mopeco in s1 to check mopeco model simulations the evolution of the total available water in the soil fig 6 a was compared with measured soil water potential in sector s1 fig 6b from sensors located in the area that received approximately the mean application rate z2 fig 3 these data were used to determine if the irrigation scheduling was suitable or not deficit or excessive the soil water potential declined during crop establishment reaching 70 cbar at 0 2 m and 35 cbar at 0 4 m and thereafter was confined to low values averaging around 15 cbar in the rooting zone which indicated that the crop did not suffer water stress noting that eta etm was unity throughout the entire cropping season fig 6a simulated as well as measured results indicated that the maize did not undergo water stress for positions that received the mean application rate however the z1 zone in sector s1 associated with positions that received less water mopeco indicated that the crop suffered water stress during the reproductive stages extending from ovule development r1 to dent r5 that would result in significant reductions in grain yield which was observed and is discussed in a succeeding section fig 6c in sector s1 the average depth of net water that reached the soil surface net irrigation plus effective precipitation was 741 7 mm while the gross depth was 786 9 mm with an effective precipitation of 33 4 mm during the cropping season inspection of the evolution of the soil water content fig 6a shows that in some instances field capacity was exceeded and thus the model simulated percolation which totaled 125 7 mm throughout the cropping season of this total 70 mm corresponded to an irrigation scheduling error on the 19 and 22 of july in which the two sectors s1 and s2 were irrigated at the same time applying around the double of the expected irrigation depth and the rest were a result of rainfall during may fig 6a with respect to sector s2 the depth of net water that reached the soil surface was 864 7 mm 831 3 mm net irrigation plus 33 4 mm effective precipitation with a gross depth of 917 8 mm the deep percolation losses estimated by mopeco were 230 5 mm 83 more than s1 which were caused by applying more irrigation water than required by the crop in this case it is necessary to emphasize that during the period between june 12th and july 24th that coincided with the vegetative growth stage and extending to the initiation of tasseling the percolation was 160 2 mm or 53 more than in s1 during this period 3 3 monitoring of crop phenology monitoring of crop phenology permitted the identification of when kc and ky corresponding to crop stages changed throughout the growing season table 1 in general the six monitored areas showed a similar rate of crop development the accumulated growing degree days gdd were similar to those established by domínguez et al 2012a for a range of cultivars carried out in the study area the main differences appear in the second vegetative growth stage although the total gdd are within the mean standard deviation interval as usual when using gdd during the first stages the variability among seasons is greater with decreasing field variability with time piccinni et al 2009 ruiz corral et al 2002 3 4 grain yield analysis although the soil properties of the plots were very uniform the average cu 84 of irrigation applied led to important differences in the yield distribution caused by the significant deficit in the under irrigated areas thus the average maize grain yield obtained for the plots expressed herein at standard water content 0 14 kg kg 1 wet basis was 8 1 percent lower in sector s1 compared with sector s2 which received 17 more net irrigation table 3 fig 7 mean grain yield in sector s2 approached the maximum expected yield ym of 18 4 mg ha 1 and exhibited no significant differences in yield among zones with differing quantities of net irrigation table 3 in contrast sector s1 exhibited significant yield increases with increasing net irrigation thus zone z1 which received 25 less net irrigation than the averaged s1 area decreased the overall mean yield by 2 4 and 4 0 mg ha 1 compared with zones z2 and z3 respectively table 3 mean combine yields harvested by the producer were 14 1 and 15 8 mg ha 1 for s1 and s2 respectively which represents a 12 greater yield for s2 that is similar to the yield difference in hand harvested plots 9 greater this greater difference in the average yield obtained between the samples collected by hand in the subareas with mean pressure and the total harvested by the machinery were caused by a higher proportion of under irrigated area in the edges of s1 collectively these results indicate that in z1 s1 the crop was under water stress which caused a yield drop in z2 s1 the crop yield was marginally affected by water stress and lastly in z3 s1 yield did not significantly respond to further increases in irrigation levels fig 7a the observed yield results demonstrate that grain yield increased with increasing net water applied net irrigation precipitation up to approximately 800 mm fig 7 which has also been observed by other authors domínguez et al 2012a aguilar et al 2007 in an experiment conducted in southern spain applied different deficit irrigation strategies to several cultivars of fao 700 maize obtained higher yields in those treatments without water stress the obtained average yield was 18 184 kg ha 1 applying 728 mm of gross irrigation simulated grain yields by mopeco for each of the observed net water applications were within 10 of the mean measured yields for each of the zones in each sector measured yield trends exhibited a possible decline at net water applications greater than about 860 mm however mopeco was unable to simulate the decline because predicted yield responds only to total available water and eta etm cannot exceed unity allen et al 1998 domínguez et al 2011 we used a 2nd degree polynomial to fit the measured yields to net water applied to the crop this empirical relationship has regularly been used to describe the slight decline in yield with excess applied water english and raja 1996 karam et al 2014 krupnik et al 2012 that could have resulted from significant leaching of nitrogen fertilizers out of the root zone other effect of applying a great amount of water is waterlogging that may cause suffocation and or rottenness of the roots nevertheless the soil texture and the irrigation depths were not able to cause these effects overall the results demonstrate that poor irrigation uniformity causes significant variations in the grain yield consequently when scheduling irrigation to fulfill the net water requirements of the crop using the average application depth in areas of the field where the amount of water received is lower than the average rate applied yield will be reduced and thereby affects the field averaged yield in contrast in those areas where irrigation is in excess of crop requirements yield is not increased or is possibly reduced when drainage below the root zone is significantly increased table 3 since the soil properties were very uniform the results demonstrate that simultaneous optimization of both water use and yield within a field requires good irrigation uniformity of course in the case of a lack of uniformity in terms of soil properties in the plot this could also cause a variability in the yield if the soil water retention is significantly different 3 5 effect of irrigation application uniformity on mopeco simulated yields the simulations of mopeco cu for the 25 irrigation realizations in sectors s1 and s2 fig 7b generated mean field scale grain yields based on the normal probability distribution associated with the measured cu for sector s1 the simulated field scale of yield of 17 3 mg ha 1 for 742 mm net water compared closely to average measured yield of 16 6 mg ha 1 hand sampled within the field likewise in the s2 sector the simulated yield of 18 0 mg ha 1 with an average eta etm of 0 99 and a net water application of 865 mm approximated the average measured yield of 18 1 mg ha 1 the simulated yields of mopeco cu also exhibited similar trends to measured yields in each of the zones of sectors s1 and s2 fig 7b although these simulations do not reflect the possible yield decline with excess irrigation table 3 fig 7b also demonstrates the effect of irrigation uniformity on the range in simulated crop yield for a given irrigation schedule thus for the s1 sector the application of 742 mm of net water distributed with a cu 84 simulated yields generated from the 25 realizations of scheduled irrigation depths 441 to 1043 mm ranged from 10 4 to 18 4 mg ha 1 for the greater area averaged application in s2 865 mm simulated yields generated from the 25 realizations 512 to 1218 mm ranged from 13 2 to 18 4 mg ha 1 for scenario a2 the average gross irrigation rate was based on 8 5 mm h 1 at 4 6 bars measured during the evaluations and corrected using eq 4 to account for the actual pressure during each irrigation a measured cu 84 and pa 50 gives a calculated value of the distribution efficiency depa as 0 92 keller and bliesner 1990 eq 5 and measured re for the evaluations was 8 0 8 5 or 0 94 this scenario leads to an epa of 0 86 and hence a smaller quantity of net water applied for the same gross application rate by the irrigation system 7 3 mm h 1 at 4 6 bars which represents the standard conditions normally considered the classic definition of irrigation application efficiency the grain yields estimated under scenario a2 simulated with mopeco and not with mopeco cu for the corresponding irrigation scheduling in sectors s1 and s2 closely approximated the average measured yields of all zones for each sector table 3 exhibiting a maximum difference of 0 3 mg ha 1 with the average yield obtained in the scenario a1 to better understand the influence of irrigation uniformity on field scale grain yields mopeco cu was used to generate realizations for a range of uniformity coefficients cu and maintaining the irrigation scheduling used for sector s1 for cu s of 70 84 and 90 percent the average simulated yields were 15 9 17 3 and 17 9 mg ha 1 respectively demonstrating that the range in net water applied over the entire surface increased with decreasing cu with a consequent decline in predicted field scale yield 3 6 cost and return analysis by using the production costs associated with the crop table 2 the measured and simulated grain yields for the various scenarios table 3 the sale price of the grain 0 17 kg 1 and the irrigation water cost that includes the energy for pumping and the maintenance of the irrigation system 0 07 m 3 based on data provided by the producer it was calculated the profitability of maize production for differing irrigation scenarios was calculated table 4 although there was a significant difference in the gross volume of irrigation water ig supplied to the crop the variations in the production costs are small table 2 because of the low cost of irrigation water for this irrigation cooperative in areas with greater irrigation water costs as in the case of the hydrogeological unit eastern mancha huem where irrigation water cost is 0 12 m 3 carrión et al 2016 greater ig would have influenced productions costs to a greater degree and consequently the gross margin gm would have been smaller a production index pi of near unity for the simulated and measured hand harvest yields in sector s2 table 4 demonstrate that irrigation was sufficient to meet or was in excess of crop requirements this suggests that a relative water supply rws or a relative irrigation supply ris of 1 2 was adequate to avoid water stress caused by poor distribution uniformity and imprecise irrigation scheduling in contrast the pi obtained for s1 in the zone that received least irrigation z1 was 0 79 and averaged 0 92 for the entire sector indicating that irrigation was inadequate to meet crop demand throughout most of the sector lastly it is clear that applying to the plot the average value of the irrigation water requirements of the crop for full irrigation this amount of water is insufficient in the under irrigated areas caused by the lack of the irrigation uniformity for this reason farmers use to solve this problem by applying a higher irrigation depth as the one in this study consequently this management decreases the water productivity and also increases the leaching and contamination of aquifers therefore in water scarce arid or semi arid zones improving the uniformity of the irrigation system is a better solution than supplying a greater amount of water for reaching high yields the calculated gross margin table 4 shows that there is a clear advantage of the irrigation strategy implemented in sector s2 with a 67 greater gross margin compared with sector s1 when based on the combine yield data and 22 greater gross margin based on hand sampled yield data within sector s1 gm increased with increased net water and reduced water deficit in each of the zones and was significantly greater in zones z2 and z3 compared with z1 in sector s2 zone z3 had significantly lower gm compared with the other two zones because of the greater cost associated with irrigation combined with lower yield possibly due to nitrate leaching and n deficiency gross margin as a function of gross water applications gross irrigation effective precipitation exhibited a maximum at around 900 mm and thereafter declined with increasing gross water based on the hand sample grain yield data fig 8 a similar behavior was also observed for the mopeco cu simulated yield however gross margin began to decline when gross water applications exceeded about 750 mm gross margin was also evaluated for the 25 realizations generated by mopeco cu for scenario a1 in the s1 sector assuming coefficients of uniformity cu of 70 84 and 90 percent for these simulations calculated field scale gross margin ranged from 582 ha 1 for a cu 70 to 831 ha 1 for a cu 84 and 927 ha 1 for cu 90 consequently improvements in the irrigation uniformity not only can improve water use efficiency but also markedly increases the gross margin of the operation the application uniformity of irrigation thus has a significant influence on the grain yield and gross margin of maize irrigation sufficient to meet crop water requirements on a field scale basis combined with uniformity coefficient of 84 which could be considered acceptable can result in significant decreases in field scale yield and gross margin as demonstrated in sector s1 consequently when comparing irrigation strategies that are seemingly inefficient one should consider the coefficient of uniformity in sector s2 that had an average application rate 17 greater than crop requirements grain yield was 8 8 greater and gross margin was 22 greater than sector s1 that had application volumes that matched areal averaged crop requirements the differences are greater based on combine yield with an 11 9 increase in yield and a 67 increase in gross margin for sector s2 compared with s1 these results are based on an irrigation water cost in the study area of 0 07 m 3 which is low compared to other regions for example in other areas of the eastern mancha aquifer with an irrigation water cost of 0 12 m 3 the gross margins obtained would be negative for the z3 s2 zone with the greatest amount of applied irrigation 1160 mm therefore in areas with greater water costs producers are trying to reduce costs principally irrigation fertilizers pesticides labor and seed to achieve greater gross margins 4 conclusions the uniformity of applied irrigation was found to have a significant effect on maize grain yield and gross margin in this study a uniformity coefficient of 84 combined with irrigation that applied on average 17 above crop water requirements resulted in a 11 9 yield advantage and a 67 greater gross margin for combine yields compared with an irrigation strategy that was sufficient to meet areal averaged crop water requirements these differences in gross margin were lower for the hand harvested yields and also would decline as the cost of water pumping and delivery increases mopeco simulated grain yields obtained in the zones receiving differing irrigation depths with differences of less than 10 between observed and simulated values when the effect of irrigation uniformity was considered mopeco simulated grain yields within 5 of mean hand harvested yields based on simulations with mopeco cu the uniformity coefficient was shown to have a considerable influence on the gross profit margin for a cu 70 the yield was reduced by 11 with a consequent decline in gross margin by 37 for a cu 90 water use efficiency is dependent on the design and management of the irrigation system whereby the application uniformity and irrigation scheduling directly impacts the profitability of irrigated production these relationships are also influenced by costs associated with the pumping and delivery of irrigation water as well as maintenance of the irrigation system further improvement of water use efficiency by using a controlled deficit irrigation strategy with tools like mopeco must necessarily ensure that irrigated producers are adequately trained and informed with regards to

11296,optimized irrigation scheduling to better match applied water to crop requirements can reduce the consumptive use of water and energy improve water use efficiency and increase gross profit margin however the distribution uniformity of applied irrigation can modify the way reduced water applications influence field averaged performance especially for crops sensitive to water stress as maize in which the most sensitive stages are those related with reproduction and grain formation we evaluated the effect of irrigation uniformity on the yield and profitability of maize zea mays l in albacete spain in two adjacent sectors equipped with a solid set sprinkler irrigation system of a field managed according to fao 56 methodology throughout the growing season to maximize grain yield without water stress sector s1 or irrigation scheduling determined by an experienced producer sector s2 irrigation uniformity was evaluated using catch cans in both fields and grain yield was harvested within zones exhibiting 75 z1 100 z2 and 125 z3 of area averaged volume applications throughout the year the average coefficient of uniformity cu in both sectors s1 and s2 was 83 5 and the net amount of applied irrigation water totaled 709 mm in s1 and 832 mm in s2 average grain yield in sector s2 approached the maximum expected yield of 18 4 mg ha 1 and exhibited no significant differences in yield among zones in contrast sector s1 exhibited significant yield differences p 0 05 among zones with a measured yield in z3 of 18 5 mg ha 1 and a yield reduction of 1 6 mg ha 1 and 4 0 mg ha 1 in z2 and z1 respectively consequently the area averaged yield in s1 was 8 less than in s2 this last treatment was positively influenced by a higher amount of irrigation water supplied to the crop 17 which decreased the effect of low cu 83 5 the grain yields simulated by mopeco for each monitoring zone within the sectors exhibited similar magnitude and trends because of these yield differences and the relatively low cost of irrigation water area averaged gross margin in s1 was 18 less compared with s2 simulations with mopeco over a range of cu s demonstrated that improved irrigation uniformity increased area averaged yields and gross margin when following s1 instead of s2 strategy the main innovations of this work were to quantify the effect of irrigation uniformity on the gross margin of a maize crop and to highlight that in arid and semiarid areas with water scarce conditions it is a better strategy to improve the irrigation uniformity than supply a higher amount of irrigation water to mask the lack of uniformity keywords irrigation scheduling solid set sprinkler irrigation system crop modeling mopeco energy saving water saving 1 introduction increasing world population risks of floods and droughts associated with climate change and demands for fresh water for urban and environmental services are leading to a decline in water resources available for agriculture fallon and betts 2010 this calls for an improvement in the efficiency and productivity of water used in agriculture to ensure sustainable production of food and fiber improvements in the application efficiency of irrigation water within the framework of precision farming is one approach that has the potential to increase productivity yet reduce the environmental impact of irrigated agriculture monaghan et al 2013 smith et al 2010 smith et al 2010 proposed that a precision irrigation system permits i the determination of the time amount and spatial pattern of the next irrigation water application to maximize yield water use efficiency or profitability ii the regulation of the applied volume as close as possible to what is recommended iii the estimation of the magnitude and spatial pattern of the irrigation applications based on direct measurements or simulations and iv uses these responses as feedback to plan the next irrigation improving the use of water energy and production practices therefore requires a holistic approach using tools and models that consider all the factors that influence crop response among others tools such as dssat csm jones et al 2003 or isareg pereira et al 2003 can facilitate water savings and the elaboration of farm level cropping strategies with the objective of maximizing the productivity of water and minimizing environmental impacts however these models do not take into account the uniformity of irrigation in their simulations the lack of uniformity may cause the decrease of yield in the areas of the plot receiving a lower amount of water consequently this effect decreases the water and economic productivity lópez mata et al 2010 castilla la mancha fig 1 is a semiarid region of spain which depends on groundwater resources for irrigation the increasing price of the energy required for pumping water from the aquifers and the use of pressurized irrigation systems make necessary the use of decision making tools that incorporate pumping and energy costs into water management to optimize profitability mopeco ortega et al 2004 model for the economical optimization of irrigation water has been calibrated for the principal crops cultivated over the eastern mancha aquifer fig 1 maize barley wheat onion and garlic using data from full and deficit irrigated field studies yield curves as a function of applied

crops mopeco helps determine the planted acreage and the level of deficit irrigation applied at each crop growth stage for each crop to maximize farm profitability moreover when the irrigation uniformity is lower than 100 its effect on crop yield can be considered during the irrigation scheduling by using the coefficient of uniformity module developed for mopeco mopeco cu by lópez mata et al 2010 the objectives of this work are to i evaluate the effect of the uniformity of sprinkler irrigation applications on the yield and economic profitability of maize using two irrigation scheduling

applications and determine suitable irrigation strategies for maize cultivation in the zone in relation to pumping and delivery costs of water 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was

of equal area which were independently irrigated the portion of the plot receiving irrigation water from both sectors was considered as border between the two treatments the field was equipped with a fixed solid set sprinkler irrigation system with buried laterals and sprinkler heads spaced 17 3 14 7 m each sector was comprised of 72 sprinklers distributed along six laterals with twelve sprinklers per lateral each tied to the submain at the center of each lateral to permit good application uniformity impact sprinkler heads agro 35 cometal inc albacete spain consisted of a single nozzle of diameter 5 2 mm and were mounted at a height of 2 3 m above the soil surface level at the beginning of the study two evaluations per sector were carried out on may 19th and june 2nd to characterize the spatial distribution of the irrigation system and obtain the data necessary for irrigation scheduling operational pressure average application rate and cu both evaluations were carried out in the area defined by four specific sprinklers 9 10 16 and 17 which correspond with the average pressure of the sector fig 2 evaluations started at 6 a m and finished at 9 a m in order to reach low wind speeds average of 0 8 and 1 0 m s 1 respectively 30 catch cans of 0 16 m of diameter and 0 15 m of height at a spacing of 2 9 2 9 m were used for collecting the irrigation water later these areas were used to control the soil moisture progression and to take the harvest samples the methodology proposed by merriam and keller 1978 was used for these assessments taking into account the established standards iso 7749 2 1990 as well as the american standards asae s330 1 2003 the field was planted to a late maturing fao 700 maize zea mays l cultivar antiss limagrain elorz navarre spain characterized by a high yield potential the crop was planted on april 18th 2016 in 0 70 m rows at a population of 85 000 plants ha 1 and subsequently managed according to cultural practices customarily used in the region 2 2 irrigation scheduling having into account the results of the irrigation uniformity evaluation two irrigation strategies were applied in the two sectors during the study irrigation in sector 1 s1 was scheduled based on the simplified water balance in the soil proposed by fao 56 allen et al 1998 by using the maize crop parameters determined by domínguez et al 2012a in the area the objective was to apply the irrigation requirements of the crop for avoiding water stress in the zones of the plot receiving the average amount of irrigation water applied by the system irrigation in sector 2 s2 was determined by the farmer according to his experience during the irrigation of maize in this area for more than 15 years because the field is within a collective irrigation network with managed allocations the producer is only able to irrigate two days a week for this study all irrigation applications were completed during the night with a maximum duration of four hours for both sectors and within the eight hour time window in which the cost of electric consumption is at its lowest reference evapotranspiration allen et al 1998 was determined using weather data collected from a nearby automated agrometeorological station http eportal magrama gob es websiar inicio aspx located 5 km in a large level area with uniform vegetation the weather station is located in an experimental farm over a natural vegetation surface frequently sprinkler irrigated surrounded by fields of crops full irrigated during the summer months precipitation was monitored using a rain gage located at the field site and effective precipitation was estimated with the usda methodology where the hydrological soil group was iii slope 3 conditions for infiltration were good and labors followed more or less the slope lines which implies a curve number equal to 80 scs 1972 nrcs 2004 the crop coefficients kc for each crop development stage developed by domínguez et al 2012a for maize in the region table 1 were used to calculate evapotranspiration without crop water stress etm the duration of each growth stage and associated kc was determined by monitoring on a weekly basis the phenology of the maize in the field plots according to the bbch scale bleiholder et al 2001 the durations of the stages were translated into cumulative growing degree days using the double triangle method sevacherian et al 1977 and were compared with those obtained by domínguez et al 2012a for this cultivar in the region under water stress conditions mopeco calculates actual crop evapotranspiration eta by using the methodology proposed by allen et al 1998 the required daily soil water balance for determining eta is described in domínguez et al 2011 which is also based on fao 56 methodology allen et al 1998 2 3 grain yield estimation with mopeco the mopeco model uses the equation proposed by stewart et al 1977 to estimate grain yield based on the ratio of the actual crop evapotranspiration eta to etm at each of the crop growth stages the determination of the daily eta requires the simulation of the daily progression of moisture content in the root zone thus when eta

in the study year 2 4 soil moisture sensors and operating pressures of the irrigation system to verify that the irrigation schedule determined by mopeco was suitable for avoiding soil water depletion two pairs of watermark sensors irrometer corp riverside ca usa were installed at 0 2 and 0 4 m in sector s1 and located in zone 2 used as reference for irrigation scheduling in s1 near where hand harvested samples were collected fig 2 sensors were connected to am 400 hansen integrators irrometer corp riverside ca usa to acquire mean voltage values over eight hour intervals to yield three measurements per day a pressure transducer druck leicester uk previously calibrated over a range of 0 6 bars was installed to monitor irrigation applications in both sectors during the study the transducer was installed in a line just prior to the sprinkler head that represented the average operating pressure of the irrigation system relative to the control area of the remaining the transducer was installed at a height of 1 m above the soil surface such that the upstream and downstream distances were greater than 10 times the pipe diameter iso 15886 3 2012 to provide stable pressure measurements pressure measurements were recorded at two minute intervals and permitted the determination of the start and end of each irrigation event the pressure variation during each irrigation and the application volume based on the pressure flow relationship determined from evaluations of this irrigation system because the irrigation system is within a cooperative with coordinated scheduling slight variations in pressure may occur and result in differences in applied volumes for each irrigation the general sprinkler equation is expressed as eq 2 keller and bliesner 1990 2 q k h 0 5 where q emission rate k emission coefficient 0 5 emission exponent h inlet pressure head of the sprinkler therefore the actual application depth da mm for each irrigation was calculated as 3 d a p m d t r p r p e 0 5 where pmd is the mean irrigation intensity mm h 1 obtained from recorded depths in catch gages during the day of the evaluation pr is the mean pressure during the irrigation event kpa pe is the mean pressure kpa during the evaluation and tr is the application time of the irrigation event h 2 5 grain yield analysis maize grain yield was determined by hand harvesting a representative sample at physiological maturity in small subplots 1 4 m 2 m length at three locations z1 z2 z3 within each sector with two subplot replications per location fig 2 in each plot replication the number of plants and ears height of five plants ear mass and length dry grain mass mass 100 dry kernels and dry 70 c above ground biomass were determined analysis of variance anova was carried out using statgraphics to evaluate the location effect on grain yield noting that at each location a different level of irrigation was received because of unequal uniformity of application separation of means was completed using fisher s protected lsd method with p values less than 0 05 declared as significant 2 6 effect of irrigation uniformity on grain yield and gross margin to obtain a first level approximation of the effect of irrigation uniformity on field scale grain yield and gross margin three areas within each of the sectors were identified for harvest sampling and further analysis in sector 1 these areas established based on the distribution of applied net irrigation in from two evaluations were z1 representative of approximately 25 less irrigation than the field average 0 75 in z2 representative of the approximate field average in and z3 representative of approximately 25 greater than the field average 1 25 in in sector 2 these areas were selected in the same manner to analyse the effect of irrigation volume and uniformity on grain yield and gross margin two scenarios were considered first one scenario a1 by using the simulation model mopeco which had into account the uniformity of water applied by the irrigation system in the crop yield mopeco cu second one scenario a2 by using the classical concept of application efficiency for the irrigation system scenario a1 each irrigation event was divided into m 25 realizations with differing application depths assuming that distribution of irrigation application depths across the surface have a normal distribution with a mean value equal to the field average net application depths and a coefficient of uniformity cu measured during the two evaluations christiansen 1942 as all irrigation events were at night and with low wind velocities average of 1 6 m s 1 it was further assumed that there was no significant lateral redistribution of soil water during infiltration and the resultant increase in available soil water reflect net application depths with a normal distribution associated with the measured cu keller and bliesner 1990 for each of the realizations daily soil water balance was calculated throughout the growing season and the resultant grain yield was simulated using mopeco cu with the field scale yield obtained through integration of the 25 subplots scenario a2 the average net irrigation in the field was calculated from the average gross water depth applied by the irrigation system ig multiplied by the application efficiency epa the average gross irrigation rate was based on 8 5 mm h 1 and corrected using eq 3 to account for the actual pressure during each irrigation application efficiency was estimated using the procedures established by keller and bliesner 1990 as 4 e p a d e p a r e where depa is the distribution efficiency for the desired percentage area that is adequately irrigated pa and re is the average fraction of ig that reaches the soil surface this scenario leads to a smaller quantity of net water applied for the same gross application rate by the irrigation system which represents the standard conditions normally considered in irrigation management the average field scale yield of the crop was subsequently determined with mopeco using the effective precipitation plus the irrigation application depths determined as e pa ig and assumed to be uniform throughout the sector 2 7 evaluation of production costs the production costs of the crop were calculated using the labor fertilizer and other raw material inputs as well as the costs associated with irrigation that were supplied by the producer according to de juan et al 2003 the costs can be classified as a external costs associated with the costs of seed fertilizer pesticides and water including energy cost b calculated costs related to labor and machinery and c estimated costs of crop insurance and machinery rental table 2 revenues from crop sales were calculated using the information facilitated by the producer related to the sale price kg 1 and the grain yield obtained from the harvest kg ha 1 and estimated cap common agricultural policy of the european union subsidies the effect of distinct irrigation management practices in sectors s1 and s2 was evaluated using the following indicators relative to the irrigation volume and the production and financial efficiencies a relative water supply rws describes the relationship between the amount of water used and that estimated as necessary for production levine 1982 and calculated as 5 r w s i g p e e t m where ig is the gross applied irrigation m3 ha 1 including the difference between the water available in the soil at sowing and at harvest pe is effective precipitation m3 ha 1 and irrigation water required by a fully irrigated crop was assumed equal to etm the maximum crop evapotranspiration without water stress m3 ha 1 the initial stored soil water assumed to be equivalent to 80 of the total available water taw soil water content at field capacity soil water content at wilting point in the 0 40 m rooting zone was also included in the pe term if rws 115 irrigation is considered excessive whereas if 85 rws 115 the crop is considered well watered however if rws 85 irrigation is considered insufficient b relative irrigation supply ris describes the relation between the gross irrigation supply ig and the volume of irrigation water necessary to avoid an undesirable stress throughout the crop growth cycle etm pe molden et al 1998 6 r i s i g e

water applied m3 ha 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 irrigation system evaluations during the two evaluations of the irrigation system in sector s1 the mean pressure was 4 6 bars the mean application rate of the sprinkler heads was 8 5 mm h 1 and the mean volume of water collected from the 30 catch cans fig 2 resulted in an effective application rate of 8 0 mm h 1 and an average fraction of ig that reaches the soil surface re 0 94 8 0 8 5 because measured pressure fluctuations during irrigations were more pronounced during the season compared with the two evaluations resulting in a lower mean pressure the estimated mean effective application rate for the entire season was estimated to be 7 5 mm h 1 based on the pressure flow relationship of eq 4 the uniformity coefficients cu calculated for the two evaluations were 83 8 s1 and 83 3 s2 and averaged 83 5 this value 83 85 is considered to be the limit of what is acceptable for individual irrigations with low wind velocities keller and bliesner 1990 ortiz et al 2010 tarjuelo et al 1999 but this limit is not clearly identified for this reason this work aims to quantify the effect of sprinkler irrigation uniformity although more field trials are needed to identify this limit in different types of soil crops and irrigation systems in this sense the mopeco cu model may offer an approximation the mean volumes of water collected in the two evaluations carried during the initial part of the study demonstrated that catch cans located in the vicinity of the sprinklers received less irrigation fig 3 with the central area distant from sprinkler head receiving a greater proportion of water this is a characteristic distribution obtained when the sprinkler heads consist of a single nozzle tarjuelo et al 1999 given that all irrigations were carried out during the nighttime and with low wind velocities it is reasonable to assume that distributions were similar for other irrigation events throughout the growing season and that this had a cumulative effect of less water being applied in the vicinity of the sprinkler heads thereby affecting the sampled yield in this zone as indicated in the methodology the three zones z1 z2 and z3 in each sector were identified fig 3 establishing plots in such a manner to permit the evaluation of the crop behavior with distinct levels of applied net irrigation consequently net irrigation applied at a nozzle pressure of 4 6 bars was estimated to be 6 3 mm h 1 8 0 mm h 1 and 10 5 mm h 1 for zones z1 z2 and z3 respectively based on the data collected during the evaluations with the objective of improving the distribution uniformity of applied irrigation a third evaluation of the irrigation system within the study field was carried out after maize harvest with the same conditions as the previous two evaluations except for the use of sprinkler heads with two nozzles 4 8 and 2 4 mm with an operating pressure during the evaluation of 4 6 bars the mean application rate of the sprinkler heads was 9 0 mm h 1 and the mean volume of water collected from the 30 catch cans fig 2 resulted in an effective application rate of 8 8 mm h 1 the coefficient of uniformity for this evaluation was 90 which indicates a significant improvement in the distribution of water compared with cu 83 5 obtained with a single nozzle during this evaluation which took place at dawn the maximum wind velocity was 1 8 m s 1 3 2 irrigation scheduling since the objective is evaluating the effect of the uniformity of sprinkler irrigation applications on the yield and economic profitability it is important to analyses the irrigation scheduling in the two sectors s1 and s2 the depth of irrigation applied in each event was estimated based on the average working pressure measured by the transducer fig 4 irrigation was applied during the nighttime under conditions of low wind velocity with an average value of 1 6 m s 1 and a maximum of 3 8 m s 1 fig 5 the relatively low wind velocities reflect minor influence of wind on the distribution of water noting that once the wind exceeds a value of 2 m s 1 it can modify the uniformity of water distribution tarjuelo et al 1999 based on the evaluation data we estimated drift and evaporation losses to be 6 which are the same order of magnitude that are obtained in previous studies in the region under similar conditions ortiz et al 2009 tarjuelo et al 2000 the scheduling of irrigation was updated weekly using weather data and the progression of observed crop phenology during the entire growing season 753 5 mm of gross irrigation were applied in sector s1 and 884 4 mm in s2 that is a volume 17 greater than determined with mopeco in s1 to check mopeco model simulations the evolution of the total available water in the soil fig 6 a was compared with measured soil water potential in sector s1 fig 6b from sensors located in the area that received approximately the mean application rate z2 fig 3 these data were used to determine if the irrigation scheduling was suitable or not deficit or excessive the soil water potential declined during crop establishment reaching 70 cbar at 0 2 m and 35 cbar at 0 4 m and thereafter was confined to low values averaging around 15 cbar in the rooting zone which indicated that the crop did not suffer water stress noting that eta etm was unity throughout the entire cropping season fig 6a simulated as well as measured results indicated that the maize did not undergo water stress for positions that received the mean application rate however the z1 zone in sector s1 associated with positions that received less water mopeco indicated that the crop suffered water stress during the reproductive stages extending from ovule development r1 to dent r5 that would result in significant reductions in grain yield which was observed and is discussed in a succeeding section fig 6c in sector s1 the average depth of net water that reached the soil surface net irrigation plus effective precipitation was 741 7 mm while the gross depth was 786 9 mm with an effective precipitation of 33 4 mm during the cropping season inspection of the evolution of the soil water content fig 6a shows that in some instances field capacity was exceeded and thus the model simulated percolation which totaled 125 7 mm throughout the cropping season of this total 70 mm corresponded to an irrigation scheduling error on the 19 and 22 of july in which the two sectors s1 and s2 were irrigated at the same time applying around the double of the expected irrigation depth and the rest were a result of rainfall during may fig 6a with respect to sector s2 the depth of net water that reached the soil surface was 864 7 mm 831 3 mm net irrigation plus 33 4 mm effective precipitation with a gross depth of 917 8 mm the deep percolation losses estimated by mopeco were 230 5 mm 83 more than s1 which were caused by applying more irrigation water than required by the crop in this case it is necessary to emphasize that during the period between june 12th and july 24th that coincided with the vegetative growth stage and extending to the initiation of tasseling the percolation was 160 2 mm or 53 more than in s1 during this period 3 3 monitoring of crop phenology monitoring of crop phenology permitted the identification of when kc and ky corresponding to crop stages changed throughout the growing season table 1 in general the six monitored areas showed a similar rate of crop development the accumulated growing degree days gdd were similar to those established by domínguez et al 2012a for a range of cultivars carried out in the study area the main differences appear in the second vegetative growth stage although the total gdd are within the mean standard deviation interval as usual when using gdd during the first stages the variability among seasons is greater with decreasing field variability with time piccinni et al 2009 ruiz corral et al 2002 3 4 grain yield analysis although the soil properties of the plots were very uniform the average cu 84 of irrigation applied led to important differences in the yield distribution caused by the significant deficit in the under irrigated areas thus the average maize grain yield obtained for the plots expressed herein at standard water content 0 14 kg kg 1 wet basis was 8 1 percent lower in sector s1 compared with sector s2 which received 17 more net irrigation table 3 fig 7 mean grain yield in sector s2 approached the maximum expected yield ym of 18 4 mg ha 1 and exhibited no significant differences in yield among zones with differing quantities of net irrigation table 3 in contrast sector s1 exhibited significant yield increases with increasing net irrigation thus zone z1 which received 25 less net irrigation than the averaged s1 area decreased the overall mean yield by 2 4 and 4 0 mg ha 1 compared with zones z2 and z3 respectively table 3 mean combine yields harvested by the producer were 14 1 and 15 8 mg ha 1 for s1 and s2 respectively which represents a 12 greater yield for s2 that is similar to the yield difference in hand harvested plots 9 greater this greater difference in the average yield obtained between the samples collected by hand in the subareas with mean pressure and the total harvested by the machinery were caused by a higher proportion of under irrigated area in the edges of s1 collectively these results indicate that in z1 s1 the crop was under water stress which caused a yield drop in z2 s1 the crop yield was marginally affected by water stress and lastly in z3 s1 yield did not significantly respond to further increases in irrigation levels fig 7a the observed yield results demonstrate that grain yield increased with increasing net water applied net irrigation precipitation up to approximately 800 mm fig 7 which has also been observed by other authors domínguez et al 2012a aguilar et al 2007 in an experiment conducted in southern spain applied different deficit irrigation strategies to several cultivars of fao 700 maize obtained higher yields in those treatments without water stress the obtained average yield was 18 184 kg ha 1 applying 728 mm of gross irrigation simulated grain yields by mopeco for each of the observed net water applications were within 10 of the mean measured yields for each of the zones in each sector measured yield trends exhibited a possible decline at net water applications greater than about 860 mm however mopeco was unable to simulate the decline because predicted yield responds only to total available water and eta etm cannot exceed unity allen et al 1998 domínguez et al 2011 we used a 2nd degree polynomial to fit the measured yields to net water applied to the crop this empirical relationship has regularly been used to describe the slight decline in yield with excess applied water english and raja 1996 karam et al 2014 krupnik et al 2012 that could have resulted from significant leaching of nitrogen fertilizers out of the root zone other effect of applying a great amount of water is waterlogging that may cause suffocation and or rottenness of the roots nevertheless the soil texture and the irrigation depths were not able to cause these effects overall the results demonstrate that poor irrigation uniformity causes significant variations in the grain yield consequently when scheduling irrigation to fulfill the net water requirements of the crop using the average application depth in areas of the field where the amount of water received is lower than the average rate applied yield will be reduced and thereby affects the field averaged yield in contrast in those areas where irrigation is in excess of crop requirements yield is not increased or is possibly reduced when drainage below the root zone is significantly increased table 3 since the soil properties were very uniform the results demonstrate that simultaneous optimization of both water use and yield within a field requires good irrigation uniformity of course in the case of a lack of uniformity in terms of soil properties in the plot this could also cause a variability in the yield if the soil water retention is significantly different 3 5 effect of irrigation application uniformity on mopeco simulated yields the simulations of mopeco cu for the 25 irrigation realizations in sectors s1 and s2 fig 7b generated mean field scale grain yields based on the normal probability distribution associated with the measured cu for sector s1 the simulated field scale of yield of 17 3 mg ha 1 for 742 mm net water compared closely to average measured yield of 16 6 mg ha 1 hand sampled within the field likewise in the s2 sector the simulated yield of 18 0 mg ha 1 with an average eta etm of 0 99 and a net water application of 865 mm approximated the average measured yield of 18 1 mg ha 1 the simulated yields of mopeco cu also exhibited similar trends to measured yields in each of the zones of sectors s1 and s2 fig 7b although these simulations do not reflect the possible yield decline with excess irrigation table 3 fig 7b also demonstrates the effect of irrigation uniformity on the range in simulated crop yield for a given irrigation schedule thus for the s1 sector the application of 742 mm of net water distributed with a cu 84 simulated yields generated from the 25 realizations of scheduled irrigation depths 441 to 1043 mm ranged from 10 4 to 18 4 mg ha 1 for the greater area averaged application in s2 865 mm simulated yields generated from the 25 realizations 512 to 1218 mm ranged from 13 2 to 18 4 mg ha 1 for scenario a2 the average gross irrigation rate was based on 8 5 mm h 1 at 4 6 bars measured during the evaluations and corrected using eq 4 to account for the actual pressure during each irrigation a measured cu 84 and pa 50 gives a calculated value of the distribution efficiency depa as 0 92 keller and bliesner 1990 eq 5 and measured re for the evaluations was 8 0 8 5 or 0 94 this scenario leads to an epa of 0 86 and hence a smaller quantity of net water applied for the same gross application rate by the irrigation system 7 3 mm h 1 at 4 6 bars which represents the standard conditions normally considered the classic definition of irrigation application efficiency the grain yields estimated under scenario a2 simulated with mopeco and not with mopeco cu for the corresponding irrigation scheduling in sectors s1 and s2 closely approximated the average measured yields of all zones for each sector table 3 exhibiting a maximum difference of 0 3 mg ha 1 with the average yield obtained in the scenario a1 to better understand the influence of irrigation uniformity on field scale grain yields mopeco cu was used to generate realizations for a range of uniformity coefficients cu and maintaining the irrigation scheduling used for sector s1 for cu s of 70 84 and 90 percent the average simulated yields were 15 9 17 3 and 17 9 mg ha 1 respectively demonstrating that the range in net water applied over the entire surface increased with decreasing cu with a consequent decline in predicted field scale yield 3 6 cost and return analysis by using the production costs associated with the crop table 2 the measured and simulated grain yields for the various scenarios table 3 the sale price of the grain 0 17 kg 1 and the irrigation water cost that includes the energy for pumping and the maintenance of the irrigation system 0 07 m 3 based on data provided by the producer it was calculated the profitability of maize production for differing irrigation scenarios was calculated table 4 although there was a significant difference in the gross volume of irrigation water ig supplied to the crop the variations in the production costs are small table 2 because of the low cost of irrigation water for this irrigation cooperative in areas with greater irrigation water costs as in the case of the hydrogeological unit eastern mancha huem where irrigation water cost is 0 12 m 3 carrión et al 2016 greater ig would have influenced productions costs to a greater degree and consequently the gross margin gm would have been smaller a production index pi of near unity for the simulated and measured hand harvest yields in sector s2 table 4 demonstrate that irrigation was sufficient to meet or was in excess of crop requirements this suggests that a relative water supply rws or a relative irrigation supply ris of 1 2 was adequate to avoid water stress caused by poor distribution uniformity and imprecise irrigation scheduling in contrast the pi obtained for s1 in the zone that received least irrigation z1 was 0 79 and averaged 0 92 for the entire sector indicating that irrigation was inadequate to meet crop demand throughout most of the sector lastly it is clear that applying to the plot the average value of the irrigation water requirements of the crop for full irrigation this amount of water is insufficient in the under irrigated areas caused by the lack of the irrigation uniformity for this reason farmers use to solve this problem by applying a higher irrigation depth as the one in this study consequently this management decreases the water productivity and also increases the leaching and contamination of aquifers therefore in water scarce arid or semi arid zones improving the uniformity of the irrigation system is a better solution than supplying a greater amount of water for reaching high yields the calculated gross margin table 4 shows that there is a clear advantage of the irrigation strategy implemented in sector s2 with a 67 greater gross margin compared with sector s1 when based on the combine yield data and 22 greater gross margin based on hand sampled yield data within sector s1 gm increased with increased net water and reduced water deficit in each of the zones and was significantly greater in zones z2 and z3 compared with z1 in sector s2 zone z3 had significantly lower gm compared with the other two zones because of the greater cost associated with irrigation combined with lower yield possibly due to nitrate leaching and n deficiency gross margin as a function of gross water applications gross irrigation effective precipitation exhibited a maximum at around 900 mm and thereafter declined with increasing gross water based on the hand sample grain yield data fig 8 a similar behavior was also observed for the mopeco cu simulated yield however gross margin began to decline when gross water applications exceeded about 750 mm gross margin was also evaluated for the 25 realizations generated by mopeco cu for scenario a1 in the s1 sector assuming coefficients of uniformity cu of 70 84 and 90 percent for these simulations calculated field scale gross margin ranged from 582 ha 1 for a cu 70 to 831 ha 1 for a cu 84 and 927 ha 1 for cu 90 consequently improvements in the irrigation uniformity not only can improve water use efficiency but also markedly increases the gross margin of the operation the application uniformity of irrigation thus has a significant influence on the grain yield and gross margin of maize irrigation sufficient to meet crop water requirements on a field scale basis combined with uniformity coefficient of 84 which could be considered acceptable can result in significant decreases in field scale yield and gross margin as demonstrated in sector s1 consequently when comparing irrigation strategies that are seemingly inefficient one should consider the coefficient of uniformity in sector s2 that had an average application rate 17 greater than crop requirements grain yield was 8 8 greater and gross margin was 22 greater than sector s1 that had application volumes that matched areal averaged crop requirements the differences are greater based on combine yield with an 11 9 increase in yield and a 67 increase in gross margin for sector s2 compared with s1 these results are based on an irrigation water cost in the study area of 0 07 m 3 which is low compared to other regions for example in other areas of the eastern mancha aquifer with an irrigation water cost of 0 12 m 3 the gross margins obtained would be negative for the z3 s2 zone with the greatest amount of applied irrigation 1160 mm therefore in areas with greater water costs producers are trying to reduce costs principally irrigation fertilizers pesticides labor and seed to achieve greater gross margins 4 conclusions the uniformity of applied irrigation was found to have a significant effect on maize grain yield and gross margin in this study a uniformity coefficient of 84 combined with irrigation that applied on average 17 above crop water requirements resulted in a 11 9 yield advantage and a 67 greater gross margin for combine yields compared with an irrigation strategy that was sufficient to meet areal averaged crop water requirements these differences in gross margin were lower for the hand harvested yields and also would decline as the cost of water pumping and delivery increases mopeco simulated grain yields obtained in the zones receiving differing irrigation depths with differences of less than 10 between observed and simulated values when the effect of irrigation uniformity was considered mopeco simulated grain yields within 5 of mean hand harvested yields based on simulations with mopeco cu the uniformity coefficient was shown to have a considerable influence on the gross profit margin for a cu 70 the yield was reduced by 11 with a consequent decline in gross margin by 37 for a cu 90 water use efficiency is dependent on the design and management of the irrigation system whereby the application uniformity and irrigation scheduling directly impacts the profitability of irrigated production these relationships are also influenced by costs associated with the pumping and delivery of irrigation water as well as maintenance of the irrigation system further improvement of water use efficiency by using a controlled deficit irrigation strategy with tools like mopeco must necessarily ensure that irrigated producers are adequately trained and informed with regards to proper management and maintenance of equipment to optimize application uniformity acknowledgements this paper has been developed within the framework of the projects agl2014 59747 c2 1 r mineco spain

11297,plant growth and photosynthesis in response to water status have been extensively investigated however elucidating the photosynthetic process and its indicators under a drought episode and rewatering across the entire leaf lifespan is often neglected in this experiment three water treatments were set during two growth seasons a control treatment moderate persistent drought t1 and severe persistent drought t2 maize leaf chlorophyll fluorescence emission was analyzed to determine the regulative responses of the photosynthetic potentials and photosystem ii psii photochemistry process to drought and rewatering in situ a severe drought episode during the peak vegetative growth stage resulted in decreases in chlorophyll content the maximal efficiency of psii photochemistry f v f m and photochemical quenching but increases in non photochemical quenching and the yield for dissipation by downregulation rewatering only restored partial psii functions in plants that had undergone historical drought episodes an analysis of non photochemical pathways of thermal dissipation indicates that regulative photoprotection of the photosystem apparatus may occur through heat dissipation when an effect of severe drought episode appeared on a young leaf however rewatering did not enhance photoprotection with leaf aging compared to the control treatment the yield of t1 and t2 decreased by 25 1 and 27 1 in 2015 and 26 4 and 54 3 in 2016 respectively the chlorophyll content was significantly and closely correlated with f v f m r 0 65 p 0 001 and the maximum versus minimum fluorescence yield in the dark adapted state f m f o r 0 72 p 0 001 additionally the two parameters can be suggested to feasibly track chlorophyll content changes and the degree of leaf senescence in responses to a drought episode and its interaction with leaf aging f m f o and the relative limitation to photosynthesis rlp the current results may provide a profound insight into better understanding the

introduction climate change is expected to result in abnormal changes in precipitation patterns including the enhanced severity and accelerated frequency of droughts ipcc 2014 water shortage a worldwide concern is a crucial constraint to crop growth productivity and yet grain yield in many regions across the world lobell et al 2014 myers et al 2017 hussain et al 2018 the limitations on biological process related to photosynthesis due to drought include reductions in chlorophyll content the net assimilation rate a net stomatal conductance and photosystem photochemical efficiency parameters as well as other related biochemical processes e g li et al 2006 guanter et al 2014 this limitation leads to plant growth inhibition and finally decreased crop production and grain yields berger et al 2016 jin et al 2017 zea mays l is one of the three major staple crops maize triticum aestivum l and oryza sativa l and also produces the main resources of the animal feed and industrial raw materials ribaut et al 2009 fao 2017 in china it is also a crucial crop in ensuring food security and husbandry industry development meng et al 2013 pinc 2018 as reported water shortage is a major constraint in maize production particularly under climatic changes jiao et al 2014 avramova et al 2015 leading to a grain yield reduction of 25 30 even without any harvests during extremely severe drought events ben ari et al 2016 in the united states us a major maize production zone drought has had a greater effect on maize production in the past two decades despite cultivar and agronomic management improvements lobell et al 2014 climatic warming is expected to further enhance the adverse impact of droughts potentially leading to a considerable decrease in maize yields ribaut et al 2009 jiao et al 2014 thus research on maize drought tolerance and its underlying mechanisms as well as the implications remain hot topics under the pressure of escalating environmental conditions lobell et al 2014 jin et al 2017 myers et al 2017 the effects of drought on the change patterns of chlorophyll a fluorescence chlf emissions are well established and have been extensively reported e g kramer et al 2004 li et al 2006 kalaji et al 2017 a large amount of research has shown that water deficit stress has negative effects on the potential and actual photochemical efficiency of psii as indicated by chlf parameters such as f v f m φpsii and q p and hence plant growth gallé et al 2007 sekhar et al 2017 however a body of evidence also indicates that the responses of some chlf parameters to drought may not be more sensitive relative to these gas exchanges marques da silva and arrabaca 2004 xu et al 2008 kalaji et al 2017 lu and zhang 1999 reported there were no changes in chlf parameters such as f v f m in maize leaves under moderate drought conditions nevertheless chlf s response to drought may depend on the species or cultivars li et al 2006 leaf age and plant development stages xu et al 2008 as well as drought severity drought treated duration and persistence marques da silva and arrabaca 2004 kalaji et al 2017 for instance maize s young leaves often maintain a relatively stable level but a significant decrease may occur in the elder leaves xu et al 2008 indicating the younger and healthier photosynthetic tissues may have a high drought tolerance at least in terms of chlf emission behaviors the results reported by marques da silva and arrabaca 2004 showed that npq tended to increase under moderate water deficit stress but decrease under severe water deficit stress furthermore different fluorescence parameters may also have different sensitivities kromdijk et al 2016 for example the overall photosynthetic performance index piabs may become a more sensitive indicator than f v f m with leaf aging for distinguishing grain yield potentials between hybrid rice cultivars zhang et al 2015 however the analysis of chlorophyll fluorescence and responses to drought episodes and rewatering across the entire leaf lifespan have received less attention particularly in situ in the field in our previous study episodic drought limitations on leaf physiological traits and partial recovery after rewatering were reported song et al 2018 however in the current study we focused on monitoring successive changes in chlorophyll fluorescence indicators across the entire maize leaf lifespan under different watering regimes thus the present aims were to 1 explore the photosynthetically physiological effects of a drought episode during a leaf s entire developmental process and 2 evaluate interactive effects between the watering regimes and leaf ages i e plant developmental stages we hypothesized the following 1 drought tolerance indicated by changes in chlorophyll fluorescence emissions may be found in the youngest and fully expanded leaves 2 an inhibition of psii photochemistry may occur at either the juvenile or elder leaf stage and 3 this inhibition may be exacerbated by a drought episode or ameliorated by rewatering furthermore especially in view of the response process we expect to obtain some new essential and critical expression parameters from chlorophyll a fluorescence emissions to highly and efficiently indicate sensitivity to a drought episode and rewatering as well as their association with stages of leaf development 2 methods and materials 2 1 site statement the present field experiment was carried out from april to september in 2015 to 2016 directly in situ at an agricultural ecosystem research station 41 49 n 121 12 e 27 4 m a s l operated by the jinzhou ecology and agricultural meteorology center in liaoning a northeastern chinese province in the renowned northeastern maize production belt pinc 2018 this region is located in northeastern eurasia characterized by a warm temperate semi humid monsoon climate and atmospheric circulation patterns mainly composed of westerlies and subtropical systems with four distinct seasons over a recent 30 year period 1981 2010 the mean annual temperature was 9 9 c with extreme maximum and minimum temperatures of 41 8 c and 31 3 c respectively the mean annual precipitation was 568 mm with 60 70 of rainfall concentrated during the major growing season the frost free period was 144 180 days annually the soil is the typical brown type with a ph value of 6 3 bulk density of 1 62 g cm 3 field capacity of 22 3 gravimetric and wilting coefficient of 6 5 the soil s organic carbon total nitrogen soil phosphorus and soil potassium content are 10 44 g kg 1 0 69 g kg 1 0 50 g kg 1 and 22 62 g kg 1 respectively the staple crop in the region is maize song et al 2018 2 2 experimental design this study was conducted over two entire growing seasons from late april to late september in 2015 and 2016 in a large electric powered water proof shelter 4 m in height which is used to keep out natural rainfall and simulate artificial precipitation via sprayers installed on the ceiling when it rains this shelter covers the plots to keep out natural rainfall but at other times it is moved from the experimental areas so the plots can be consistent with the field environment the area of each plot is 15 m2 5 m long 3 m wide and surrounded by a cement wall to avoid water penetration across the plots the maize cultivar used in this experiment was danyu 39 in 2015 and danyu 405 in 2016 which are commonly planted across northeast china it was sown in late april and the distance between the two adjacent rows and plants were 0 70 and 0 32 m respectively seeds were sown directly in drills with a 5 cm soil depth the seed rate was 6 0 m 2 to ensure the final planting density was 4 5 plants m 2 in both 2015 and 2016 and the crops were harvested in late september a compound fertilizer containing 28 11 and 12 of n p2o5 and k2o respectively of c 750 kg ha 1 was applied conventionally before sowing this experimental design is illustrated in fig 1 three water treatments were set each year control t1 and t2 which denote the control treatment i e normal irrigation every 7 days withholding 20 day and 27 day water treatments in 2015 and withholding 27 day and 41 day water treatments in 2016 from the jointing stage before and after the drought treatment period the irrigation management practice was the same as the control treatment as measured the soil s relative water content srwc 0 50 cm depth was decreased to water deficit stress levels of 30 40 at the end of each drought episode meanwhile a normal level of 70 80 was maintained in the control and drought plots after rewatering it indicated that the both t1 and t2 withholding water treatments led to severe water deficit stress at end of each drought episode total irrigation amounts for the control t1 and t2 conditions over the entire growth period were 296 mm 246 mm and 221 mm in 2015 and 260 5 mm 187 5 mm and 137 5 mm in 2016 respectively there were three replicates in each treatment results obtained from the two year experimental design were similar thus the 2015 results were mainly reported to view the 2016 results see table s1 and fig s1 in the supporting information file 2 3 measurements of leaf chlorophyll content a spad 502 plus chlorophyll meter minolta co ltd japan was used to monitor changes in selected leaves chlorophyll concentrations throughout the entire leaf development process from budding in early july to complete senescence in early september this nondestructive technique has been used to rapidly and accurately estimate leaves relative chlorophyll concentrations a u i e spad reading in situ by measuring leaves transmittance of red 650 nm and infrared 940 nm radiation the middle section of the leaf was

and expressions of chlorophyll a fluorescence chlorophyll a fluorescence was performed using a miniaturized pulse amplitude modulated photosynthesis yield analyzer mini pam walz effeltrich germany with a standard 2030 b leaf clip holder measurements of light intensity λ 380 710 nm were measured via the mini pam s microquantum sensor calibrated against an li cor quantum sensor li cor lincoln ne usa the chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters in the tagged leaves attached to the in situ field plants were measured on the same areas in each leaf and on the same dates as the spad see above measurements following a 30 min dark adaptation period the minimal fluorescence yield fo was measured by a modulated light that was sufficiently low 0 1 μmol photon m 2s 1 thus could induce minimal fluorescence the maximal fluorescence yield fm was obtained by a 0 8 s saturating pulse at 7000 μmol photons m 2s 1 in the dark adapted leaves the difference between the measured values fm fo is the variable fluorescence f v the leaves were then continuously illuminated with a white actinic light at an intensity of 300 μmol photons m 2 s 1 for at least 15 min the steady state value of fluorescence fs was thereafter recorded and the second saturating pulse at 7000 μmol photons m 2s 1 was then imposed to determine the maximal light adapted fluorescence yield fm the actinic light was removed and the minimal fluorescence level in the light adapted state fo was determined after 3 s of far red illumination the fluorescence parameters were obtained from the following formulas maxwell

francis et al 1969 2 6 data statistics spss 20 0 statistic software spss inc chicago il was used to perform the statistical analysis one way anova and duncan s multiple comparison were used to test the differences between the functional and morphological traits of leaves in each treatment condition at the 0 05 and 0 01 significance levels the effects of watering treatments and dates i e leaf plant developmental stages or leaf ages and their interaction on the multiple functional traits were tested by two way anova at the 0 05 and 0 01 significance levels correlation coefficients among the measured traits were based on person s correlation analysis the comprehensive responses of leaves photosynthetic functional parameters growth and morphological traits to irrigation regimes and dates leaf aging plant developmental stages were analyzed further with a principal component analysis pca jolliffe 2002 3 results 3 1 chlorophyll content response to drought episodes and rewatering we used the same leaves to monitor dynamic changes in leaves chlorophyll content spad values readings and photosynthetically physiological traits at different plant development leaf stages in responses to episodic drought and rewatering the plant growth stages were measured on 1 july v13 12 july vt tasselling 20 july r1 silking 5 august r2 blistering 9 august r3 milking and 2 september r4 dough respectively fig 1 as shown in fig 2 a relative chlorophyll content in control treatment increased with leaf plant growth reaching a maximum of 56 7 on 20 july r1 silking and remaining stable until 9 august r3 milking it sharply decreased to 44 1 on 2 september r4 dough in the t1 treatment withholding water from jointing to tasselling 20 days the episodic drought led to a spad decline on 12 july vt after 6 days of recent rewatering 20 july r1 silking the spad values were still significantly lower than those under the control condition with further re irrigation at stages r2 and r3 the values rose to the level of the control treatment on 2 september r4 stage spad decreased remarkably it indicated that a recovery following rewatering occurred leaf spad in the t2 treatment withholding water during jointing silking 27 days sharply declined on 20 july r1 silking but reached the partial level of the control treatment immediately upon rewatering it indicated that a 27 day episodic drought from jointing to silking significantly inhibited photosynthetic pigment accumulation but as precipitation increased spad recovered rapidly but only partly based on a two way anova table 1 spad was affected by watering f 24 13 p 0 001 and date f 21 45 p 0 001 individually as well as their interaction f 3 12 p 0 010 3 2 chlorophyll fluorescence response to drought episodes and rewatering the maximal efficiency of psii photochemistry fv fm reflects the potential photosynthetic capacity of plants which represents the fraction of absorbed photons using photochemistry in a dark adapted leaf as shown in fig 2b fv fm was not significantly affected by a continuous 20 day drought during jointing tasseling however a marked decline occurred under a 27 day drought rewatering fully recovered this parameter during grain filling the actual psii quantum yield of illuminated leaves φpsii decreased significantly with the two drought episodes fig 2c implying that the continuous drought significantly inhibited photosynthetic capacity in the light adapted leaves plants in the t1 treatment did not have an immediate recovery to normal after re irrigating however the parameter of both pre drought treatments recovered to the normal level after early grain filling the photochemical quenching of variable fluorescence q l decreased under the earlier 20 day drought but it increased after the 27 day drought and subsequent rewatering meanwhile the q l of control plants tentatively increased at the end of grain filling fig 2d a proposed parameter fm fo the maximum primary yield of the photochemistry of psii was marginally reduced by withdrawing water during both 20 and 27 day periods however rewatering did not affect it fig 2e nonphotochemical chlorophyll quenching npq was increased by the early drought and maintained a higher level until the blistering stage following the rewatering treatments fig 2f an increase in φnpq and decline in φno was found during the drought persisting and recent rewatering fig 2g h applying the protective dissipation of heat energy by balancing between regulated non photochemical energy loss and other losses for the basic or original chlf parameters fig 3 a h we found that minimal fluorescence parameters in dark adapted leaves f o increased with the drought episodes and subsequent rewatering both minimal fluorescence parameters f o and f o in dark and light adapted leaves peaked during the early leaf growing stage and then maintained a relatively stable level until the leaf senesced relative limitation to photosynthesis rlp increased with leaf development and under episodic drought other basic chlfs including f m f m f v f v and f s however showed no systematic responses to the water regimes except their declines at the end of grain filling according to a two way anova table 1 the date i e leaf aging leaf growth stage was associated with significant effects of all the chlf parameters p 0 05 and water alone significantly affected f s f m and q l no significant effects of the interaction of the two main factors were found for all the chlf parameters p 0 05 3 3 growth and morphological responses to drought episodes and rewatering under normal irrigation both total individual plant pla and the single leaf la areas changed as a unimodal form they increased with plant leaf development and peaked on the 81st day after sowing das thereafter decreasing with leaf aging fig 4 a b leaf area was not affected by the shorter duration drought t1 but it sharply declined under the longer duration drought and post rewatering fig 4a both episodic drought stresses resulted in marked declines in the entire individual plant leaf area with a sharp reduction at the end of the longer duration drying the 81st das fig 4b plant height was also significantly reduced by both episodic drought stresses and rewatering did not restore it especially when plants were subjected to the longer drying stress in the t2 treatment fig 4c compared to the control treatment the leaf rolling index lri sharply increased with persistent drought particularly under the longer drying stress fig s2 after rewatering however it rapidly and sensitively decreased fig 4d it is indicated that lri could accurately track the changing water status the two way anova test showed that the two main factors i e water date leaf age and their interaction all significantly affected the total individual plant leaf area and the single leaf area plant height and lri p 0 05 table 1 except the interactive effect on the leaf area f 1 55 p 0 181 compared with the control treatment the biomass of t1 and t2 decreased by 15 3 and 23 5 in 2015 29 5 and 53 4 in 2016 respectively and the grain yield decreased by 25 1 and 27 1 in 2015 26 4 and 54 3 in 2016 fig 5 3 4 analysis of multiple functional traits under the treated conditions relationships between the traits were tested by pearson correlation either across the entire leaf lifespan or at a severely drought stressed stage 81 das relationships between the morphological and chlf parameters of these tagged leaves are presented in table 2 over the entire leaf lifespan table 2 bottom left part the spad values were significantly and positively correlated with f v f m r 0 65 p 0 001 and f m f o r 0 72 p 0 001 la was significantly and positively correlated with most of the psii yields including φpsii f v f m and f m f o p 0 05 however compared to la plant height had antagonistic associations with the same parameters lri s strong negative relationships with spad and pla were observed whereas no significant relationships with chlfs occurred during episodic drought similar associations between these traits were observed except some became stronger such as those of spad with lri pla la f v f m and f m f o table 2 upper right part the relationships between chlfs are also listed for the two data groups in table 2 a pca on leaf chlf and morphological and plant leaf growth traits across the whole growing period was further conducted to test the traits associations and the combined effects of watering regimes and leaf aging it showed that the first two principal components pcs together explained 67 7 of the total variation of the functional traits fig 6 the loadings of the relative chlorophyll content spad readings leaf area and psii photochemical efficiency traits were almost in quadrant i with npq and φnpq in quadrant ii and these markers represent relative limitations in photosynthetic capacity plant height and leaf rolling status were in quadrant iii while the most basic initial chlfs were in quadrant iv obviously separating the distribution patterns in traits under watering conditions at different leaf development stages fig 6a the three parameters i e φpsii φnpq and φno were distributed in the different quadrants indicating heat energy s compensatory effects on photochemical and non photochemical yields for dissipation by downregulation or other losses pc1 had a strong positive correlation with spad fv fm and fm fo while pc2 had a strong positive correlation with fv fm φpsii fv and fm the latter represents these values in light adapted leaves projection of the water status conditions and leaf aging demonstrated that the different leaf development stages were distributed typically in the coordinate plane with scores during the initial leaf growth stage in quadrant iv those at the end of the leaf growth stage in the left part and those during major developmental stages in the upper part fig 6b it indicated that the effects differed profoundly due to combined factors and leaf aging or its developmental stages may play a vital role in the response of maize functional traits to precipitation regimes 4 discussion in the present study chlf responses to drought episodes were monitored progressively in the same leaf with plant development the current results found that chlorophyll content and key photosynthetic potentials such as f v f m and φpsii could be inhibited due to severe episodic drought increases in both npq and its component φnpq during drought imply the psii apparatus has photoprotective properties subsequent rewatering could restore part of the photosynthetic functions in terms of chlf which is closely associated with leaf age plant biomass and grain yield were also severely limited by the longer episodic drought 4 1 nonphotochemical quenching npq crop leaves can dissipate excess energy as heat by a photoprotective mechanism which would reduce crop yield by 20 under field conditions kromdijk et al 2016 indicated by an increase in the npq of chlorophyll fluorescence murchie and lawson 2013 this process is involved in the xanthophyll a kind of carotenoid cycle npq increases with promoting conversion of the de epoxidation of violaxanthin to antheraxanthin and zeaxanthin nilkens et al 2010 murchie and lawson 2013 however an enhanced npq may be at the a net expense at a given light intensity thus weakening the carbon fixation capacity hubbart et al 2012 murchie and lawson 2013 kromdijk et al 2016 most drought stress studies have found that a decrease in the ability to harmlessly dissipate excess energy is often accompanied by a decline in npq e g golan et al 2006 xu et al 2008 npq increases under moderate water stress conditions but decreases under severe water stress marques da silva and arrabaca 2004 our results showed that a 20 day drought episode from the peak vegetative growth stage jointing to tasselling can markedly trigger the npq increase highlighting photoprotection occurrence through the npq pathway figs 2 and 7 additionally rewatering led to a decline in npq implying a relaxation process exists with water status fluctuations this may increase energy conversion from heat dissipation into co2 fixation subsequently increasing photosynthetic efficiency rohéček 2002 murchie and lawson 2013 kromdijk et al 2016 4 2 entire dissipative process a unity can be described as the total yields for dissipative processes for the energy absorbed by psii φpsii φnpq and φno fig 7 schematically depicts energy partitioning between the three fractions φpsii φnpq and φno i e the compensatory activation of the photochemical process in relation to the xanthophyll cycle and psbs role under drought and subsequent rewatering a decrease in φnpq and increase in φno has been found under salt stress yuan et al 2014 and chilling stress riva roveda et al 2016 indicating the damage to psii rather than protection under the two abiotic stresses the present results found a decline in φpsii during both persistent drought episodes however an increase in φnpq and decline in φno occurred simultaneously indicating the protective and productive dissipation of heat energy in the younger leaves stressed through enhancing the regulated non photochemical energy loss in psii fig 2 7 moinuddin et al 2017 moreover when the plants were re watered following a pre drought episode a partial restoration in φpsii occurred but φnpq decreased and φno increased fig 2 in which a weakened xanthophyll cycle and depressed psbs protein expression may be involved fig 7 e g murchie and lawson 2013 kromdijk et al 2016 sacharz et al 2017 4 3 other chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters in the present experiment q l rapidly decreased when plants were subjected to an early drought whereas npq rose to avoid damaging photosynthetic organelles fig 2d kramer et al 2004 xu et al 2008 rewatering induced the increases in q l even exceeding those of the control treatment implicating the compensatory effect on the fraction of psii centers in open states benefitting photochemistry efficiency relative limitation to photosynthesis rlp which is expressed as a relative limitation in photosynthetic performance relative to a normal model leaf schreiber et al 1994 was strongly and negatively correlated with φpsii and positively with npq and φnpq fig 6 table 2 implying it may be recognized as a better proxy of a feasible balance between photochemistry efficiency and heat dissipation energy in the photosystem previously significant changes in fv f m have been widely used to assess species tolerance due to environmental stress factors such as drought and drought induced senescence e g xu et al 2008 a close linear relationship between either f v or f m and zeaxanthin content would implicate the xanthophyll cycle s involvement in protecting the photosynthetic apparatus against excessive light inhibition related to drought response products of signals such as aba schwarz et al 2014 the present results indicated that an increase in initial fluorescence f o versus decreases in fv f m and φpsii with the longer drought episode may imply potential damage to psii figs 2 and 3 and see franklin et al 1992 however when the early drought was imposed increases in both f o and f m and a greater increase in the latter induced an increase in f v possibly reflecting the photoprotective adaptation to psii figs 2 and 3 schwarz et al 2014 furthermore some other conventional chlf parameters such as f s and light adapted parameters i e f o f v and f m do not efficiently reflect environmental stress such as drought episodes fig 3 baker 2008 which needs to be analyzed further on a larger scale such as in canopies and ecosystems and even globally e g kalaji et al 2014 pollastrini et al 2016 yang et al 2017 4 4 leaf chlorophyll content spad readings the spad tool has been extensively used to determine crops responses to environmental variables and their adaptability ciganda et al 2009 pour aboughadareh et al 2017 prior results have indicated that the values would accurately represent realistic chlorophyll content when the realistic chlorophyll content of green leaves remains at a relatively low level steele et al 2008 ciganda et al 2009 however the species leaf structure traits leaf chlorophyll distribution and growth stages may together play important roles in the relationship between spad values and the realistic chlorophyll content determined by the conventional extraction method yamamoto et al 2002 the current study s experimental results indicate spad values could accurately track changes in leaf chlorophyll content which decreases with leaf age fig 2a in which the leaf color obviously also changed accordingly the green color gradually disappeared with leaf age field chlorophyll measurements suggested that tissue nitrogen concentrations derived by a spad chlorophyll meter at v10 and silking stages were a good predictor of grain yield wood et al 1992 it is partly confirmed by the present results which indicate a drought stricken decline in spad values from v11 to vt stages 4 5 growth stage effects the drought episode that occurred during jointing v11 silking r1 stages in the current experiment may adversely affect these processes including normal floral formation meiosis and ovary development consequently leading to a marked loss of yield barnabás et al 2008 mi et al 2017 moreover efeoglu et al 2009 found that drought stress can induce declines in f v f m φpsii and q p but increase the npq of maize leaves decreased photosynthetic efficiency due to drought stress fig 2 may conversely further reduce drought tolerance liu et al 2016 and exacerbate the limitation of leaf plant growth tissue carbohydrate accumulation and its subsequent translocation into grain fig 4 barnabás et al 2008 mi et al 2017 however psii photochemistry efficiency indicated by f v f m φpsii and q p could be only partly restored when rewatering is imposed fig 2 see also efeoglu et al 2009 xu et al 2009 sun et al s 2016 results showed that rewatering following drought stress may stimulate various metabolic activities in maize plants to return to their initially normal status this may strongly depend on the drought s historical status such as the stress severity duration or both xu et al 2010 sun et al 2016 thus both pre drought limitations and the subsequent rewatering recovery ability may finally become the crucial determinants of the photosynthetic process and other key relevant metabolic activities and consequently growth and even productivity leading to grain yield losses of 25 1 and 27 1 in 2015 26 4 and 54 3 in 2016 under t1 and t2 treatments relative to normal irrigation respectively under the same treatments 27 day drought treatment over two years the yield declines of two different varieties were the same 27 1 in 2015 and 26 4 in 2016 nevertheless improvements in the plant senescence process via genetic manipulation and saving water practices in the field might enable major crops to cope effectively with various drought events particularly under climatic change rivero et al 2007 zhao et al 2016 4 6 relationships reportedly spad readings were closely correlated with f v f m in carica papaya leaves indicating that the spad 502 chlorophyll meter might enable researchers to assess the potential efficiency of psii photochemistry particularly under environmental stress conditions such as excessive heat sharma et al 2015 in the current results there were significant and positive relationships between spad values and f v f m but not with φpsii indicating that the photosynthetic potentials in dark adapted leaves may be a proxy for leaf chlorophyll content particularly with stressful factors such as drought table 2 excessive heat sharma et al 2015 and nutritional deficits singh et al 2017 furthermore there was a significant positive association between spad and f m f o p 0 05 indicating this chlf parameter may be representative of leaf chlorophyll content table 2 a principal component analysis also highlights the relationships between the traits and the important role of leaf aging fig 6 thus spad and some key chlfs could be considered relative accurate indices of stress which may be useful in predicting losses in crop grain yield under extreme climatic events prior to harvest in conclusion the main findings were as follows i the negative effects in chlorophyll a fluorescence occurred when drought episodes occurred in the youngest and fully expanded leaves largely supporting our first hypothesis ii a photoprotection rather than inhibition of psii photochemistry was obtained under drought during the plants juvenile stage significantly negating the second hypothesis iii this inhibition from pre drought conditions could be partly ameliorated by rewatering partly confirming the third hypothesis furthermore iv adaptive responses to changing water status would be closely associated with leaf development processes the current major findings may be useful for better understanding the underlying mechanism of photochemical responses to drought history and subsequent rewatering particularly leaf aging under the rapidly changing climatic context authors contributions xz and zg conceived and designed the

11297,plant growth and photosynthesis in response to water status have been extensively investigated however elucidating the photosynthetic process and its indicators under a drought episode and rewatering across the entire leaf lifespan is often neglected in this experiment three water treatments were set during two growth seasons a control treatment moderate persistent drought t1 and severe persistent drought t2 maize leaf chlorophyll fluorescence emission was analyzed to determine the regulative responses of the photosynthetic potentials and photosystem ii psii photochemistry process to drought and rewatering in situ a severe drought episode during the peak vegetative growth stage resulted in decreases in chlorophyll content the maximal efficiency of psii photochemistry f v f m and photochemical quenching but increases in non photochemical quenching and the yield for dissipation by downregulation rewatering only restored partial psii functions in plants that had undergone historical drought episodes an analysis of non photochemical pathways of thermal dissipation indicates that regulative photoprotection of the photosystem apparatus may occur through heat dissipation when an effect of severe drought episode appeared on a young leaf however rewatering did not enhance photoprotection with leaf aging compared to the control treatment the yield of t1 and t2 decreased by 25 1 and 27 1 in 2015 and 26 4 and 54 3 in 2016 respectively the chlorophyll content was significantly and closely correlated with f v f m r 0 65 p 0 001 and the maximum versus minimum fluorescence yield in the dark adapted state f m f o r 0 72 p 0 001 additionally the two parameters can be suggested to feasibly track chlorophyll content changes and the degree of leaf senescence in responses to a drought episode and its interaction with leaf aging f m f o and the relative limitation to photosynthesis rlp the current results may provide a profound insight into better understanding the underlying mechanism of photosynthetic potentials and photochemistry efficiency and photoprotection in response to drought episodes and rewatering over the entire leaf lifespan abbreviations fs

introduction climate change is expected to result in abnormal changes in precipitation patterns including the enhanced severity and accelerated frequency of droughts ipcc 2014 water shortage a worldwide concern is a crucial constraint to crop growth productivity and yet grain yield in many regions across the world lobell et al 2014 myers et al 2017 hussain et al 2018 the limitations on

2009 jiao et al 2014 thus research on maize drought tolerance and its underlying mechanisms as well as the implications remain hot topics under the pressure of escalating environmental conditions lobell et al 2014 jin et al 2017 myers et al 2017 the effects of drought on the change patterns of chlorophyll a fluorescence chlf emissions are well established and have been extensively reported e g kramer et al 2004 li et al 2006 kalaji et al 2017 a large amount of research has shown that water deficit stress has negative effects on the potential and actual photochemical efficiency of psii as indicated by chlf parameters such as f v f m φpsii and q p and hence plant growth gallé et al 2007 sekhar et al 2017 however a body of evidence also indicates that the responses of some chlf parameters to drought may not be more sensitive relative to these gas exchanges marques da silva and arrabaca 2004 xu et al 2008 kalaji et al 2017 lu and zhang 1999 reported there were no changes in chlf parameters such as f v f m in maize leaves under moderate drought conditions nevertheless chlf s response to drought may depend on the species or cultivars li et al 2006 leaf age and plant development stages xu et al 2008 as well as drought severity drought treated duration and persistence marques da silva and arrabaca 2004 kalaji et al 2017 for instance maize s young leaves often maintain a relatively stable level but a significant decrease may occur in the elder leaves xu et al 2008 indicating the younger and healthier photosynthetic tissues may have a high drought tolerance at least in terms of chlf emission behaviors the results reported by marques da silva and arrabaca 2004 showed that npq tended to increase under moderate water deficit stress but decrease under severe water deficit stress furthermore different fluorescence parameters may also have different sensitivities kromdijk et al 2016 for example the overall photosynthetic performance index piabs may become a more sensitive indicator than f v f m with leaf aging for distinguishing grain yield potentials between hybrid rice cultivars zhang et al 2015 however the analysis of chlorophyll fluorescence and responses to drought episodes and rewatering across the entire leaf lifespan have received less attention particularly in situ in the field in our previous study episodic drought limitations on leaf physiological traits and partial recovery after rewatering were reported song et al 2018 however in the current study we focused on monitoring successive changes in chlorophyll fluorescence indicators across the entire maize leaf lifespan under different watering regimes thus the present aims were to 1 explore the photosynthetically physiological effects of a drought episode during a leaf s entire developmental process and 2 evaluate interactive effects between the watering regimes and leaf ages i e plant developmental stages we hypothesized the following 1 drought tolerance indicated by changes in chlorophyll fluorescence emissions may be found in the youngest and fully expanded leaves 2 an inhibition of psii photochemistry may occur at either the juvenile or elder leaf stage and 3 this inhibition may be exacerbated by a drought episode or ameliorated by rewatering furthermore especially in view of the response process we expect to obtain some new essential and critical expression parameters from chlorophyll a fluorescence emissions to highly and efficiently indicate sensitivity to a drought episode and rewatering as well as their association with stages of leaf development 2 methods and materials 2 1 site statement the present field experiment was carried out from april to september in 2015 to 2016 directly in situ at an agricultural ecosystem research station 41 49 n 121 12 e 27 4 m a s l operated by the jinzhou ecology and agricultural meteorology center in liaoning a northeastern chinese province in the renowned northeastern maize production belt pinc 2018 this region is located in northeastern eurasia characterized by a warm temperate semi humid monsoon climate and atmospheric circulation patterns mainly composed of westerlies and subtropical systems with four distinct seasons over a recent 30 year period 1981 2010 the mean annual temperature was 9 9 c with extreme maximum and minimum temperatures of 41 8 c and 31 3 c respectively the mean annual precipitation was 568 mm with 60 70 of rainfall concentrated during the major growing season the frost free period was 144 180 days annually the soil is the typical brown type with a ph value of 6 3 bulk density of 1 62 g cm 3 field capacity of 22 3 gravimetric and wilting coefficient of 6 5 the soil s organic carbon total nitrogen soil phosphorus and soil potassium content are 10 44 g kg 1 0 69 g kg 1 0 50 g kg 1 and 22 62 g kg 1 respectively the staple crop in the region is maize song et al 2018 2 2 experimental design this study was conducted over two entire growing seasons from late april to late september in 2015 and 2016 in a large electric powered water proof shelter 4 m in height which is used to keep out natural rainfall and simulate artificial precipitation via sprayers installed on the ceiling when it rains this shelter covers the plots to keep out natural rainfall but at other times it is moved from the experimental areas so the plots can be consistent with the field environment the area of each plot is 15 m2 5 m long 3 m wide and surrounded by a cement wall to avoid water penetration across the plots the maize cultivar used in this experiment was danyu 39 in 2015 and danyu 405 in 2016 which are commonly planted across northeast china it was sown in late april and the distance between the two adjacent rows and plants were 0 70 and 0 32 m respectively seeds were sown directly in drills with a 5 cm soil depth the seed rate was 6 0 m 2 to ensure the final planting density was 4 5 plants m 2 in both 2015 and 2016 and the crops were harvested in late september a compound fertilizer containing 28 11 and 12 of n p2o5 and k2o respectively of c 750 kg ha 1 was applied conventionally before sowing this experimental design is illustrated in fig 1 three water treatments were set each year control t1 and t2 which denote the control treatment i e normal irrigation every 7 days withholding 20 day and 27 day water treatments in 2015 and withholding 27 day and 41 day water treatments in 2016 from the jointing stage before and after the drought treatment period the irrigation management practice was the same as the control treatment as measured the soil s relative water content srwc 0 50 cm depth was decreased to water deficit stress levels of 30 40 at the end of each drought episode meanwhile a normal level of 70 80 was maintained in the control and drought plots after rewatering it indicated that the both t1 and t2 withholding water treatments led to severe water deficit stress at end of each drought episode total irrigation amounts for the control t1 and t2 conditions over the entire growth period were 296 mm 246 mm and 221 mm in 2015 and 260 5 mm 187 5 mm and 137 5 mm in 2016 respectively there were three replicates in each treatment results obtained from the two year experimental design were similar thus the 2015 results were mainly reported to view the 2016 results see table s1 and fig s1 in the supporting information file 2 3 measurements of leaf chlorophyll content a spad 502 plus chlorophyll meter minolta co ltd japan was used to monitor changes in selected leaves chlorophyll concentrations throughout the entire leaf development process from budding in early july to complete senescence in early september this nondestructive technique has been used to rapidly and accurately estimate leaves relative chlorophyll concentrations a u i e spad reading in situ by measuring leaves transmittance of red 650 nm and infrared 940 nm radiation the middle section of the leaf was measured avoiding the main leaf vein measurements were performed on 1 july v13 12 july vt tasselling 20 july r1 silking 5 august r2 blistering 9 august r3 milking 2 september r4 dough 2 4 measurements and expressions of chlorophyll a fluorescence chlorophyll a fluorescence was performed using a miniaturized pulse amplitude modulated photosynthesis yield analyzer mini pam walz effeltrich germany with a standard 2030 b leaf clip holder measurements of light intensity λ 380 710 nm were measured via the mini pam s microquantum sensor calibrated against an li cor quantum sensor li cor lincoln ne usa the chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters in the tagged leaves attached to the in situ field plants were measured on the same areas in each leaf and on the same dates as the spad see above measurements following a 30 min dark adaptation period the minimal fluorescence yield fo was measured by a modulated light that was sufficiently low 0 1 μmol photon m 2s 1 thus could induce minimal fluorescence the maximal fluorescence yield fm was obtained by a 0 8 s saturating pulse at 7000 μmol photons m 2s 1 in the dark adapted leaves the difference between the measured values fm fo is the variable fluorescence f v the leaves were then continuously illuminated with a white actinic light at an intensity of 300 μmol photons m 2 s 1 for at least 15 min the steady state value of fluorescence fs was thereafter recorded and the second saturating pulse at 7000 μmol photons m 2s 1 was then imposed to determine the maximal light adapted fluorescence yield fm the actinic light was removed and the minimal fluorescence level in the light adapted state fo was determined after 3 s of far red illumination the fluorescence parameters were obtained from the following formulas maxwell

francis et al 1969 2 6 data statistics spss 20 0 statistic software spss inc chicago il was used to perform the statistical analysis one way anova and duncan s multiple comparison were used to test the differences between the functional and morphological traits of leaves in each treatment condition at the 0 05 and 0 01 significance levels the effects of watering treatments and dates i e leaf plant developmental stages or leaf ages and their interaction on the multiple functional traits were tested by two way anova at the 0 05 and 0 01 significance levels correlation coefficients among the measured traits were based on person s correlation analysis the comprehensive responses of leaves photosynthetic functional parameters growth and morphological traits to irrigation regimes and dates leaf aging plant developmental stages were analyzed further with a principal component analysis pca jolliffe 2002 3 results 3 1 chlorophyll content response to drought episodes and rewatering we used the same leaves to monitor dynamic changes in leaves chlorophyll content spad values readings and photosynthetically physiological traits at different plant development leaf stages in responses to episodic drought and rewatering the plant growth stages were measured on 1 july v13 12 july vt tasselling 20 july r1 silking 5 august r2 blistering 9 august r3 milking and 2 september r4 dough respectively fig 1 as shown in fig 2 a relative chlorophyll content in control treatment increased with leaf plant growth reaching a maximum of 56 7 on 20 july r1 silking and remaining stable until 9 august r3 milking it sharply decreased to 44 1 on 2 september r4 dough in the t1 treatment withholding water from jointing to tasselling 20 days the episodic drought led to a spad decline on 12 july vt after 6 days of recent rewatering 20 july r1 silking the spad values were still significantly lower than those under the control condition with further re irrigation at stages r2 and r3 the values rose to the level of the control treatment on 2 september r4 stage spad decreased remarkably it indicated that a recovery following rewatering occurred leaf spad in the t2 treatment withholding water during jointing silking 27 days sharply declined on 20 july r1 silking but reached the partial level of the control treatment immediately upon rewatering it indicated that a 27 day episodic drought from jointing to silking significantly inhibited photosynthetic pigment accumulation but as precipitation increased spad recovered rapidly but only partly based on a two way anova table 1 spad was affected by watering f 24 13 p 0 001 and date f 21 45 p 0 001 individually as well as their interaction f 3 12 p 0 010 3 2 chlorophyll fluorescence response to drought episodes and rewatering the maximal efficiency of psii photochemistry fv fm reflects the potential photosynthetic capacity of plants which represents the fraction of absorbed photons using photochemistry in a dark adapted leaf as shown in fig 2b fv fm was not significantly affected by a continuous 20 day drought during jointing tasseling however a marked decline occurred under a 27 day drought rewatering fully recovered this parameter during grain filling the actual psii quantum yield of illuminated leaves φpsii decreased significantly with the two drought episodes fig 2c implying that the continuous drought significantly inhibited photosynthetic capacity in the light adapted leaves plants in the t1 treatment did not have an immediate recovery to normal after re irrigating however the parameter of both pre drought treatments recovered to the normal level after early grain filling the photochemical quenching of variable fluorescence q l decreased under the earlier 20 day drought but it increased after the 27 day drought and subsequent rewatering meanwhile the q l of control plants tentatively increased at the end of grain filling fig 2d a proposed parameter fm fo the maximum primary yield of the photochemistry of psii was marginally reduced by withdrawing water during both 20 and 27 day periods however rewatering did not affect it fig 2e nonphotochemical chlorophyll quenching npq was increased by the early drought and maintained a higher level until the blistering stage following the rewatering treatments fig 2f an increase in φnpq and decline in φno was found during the drought persisting and recent rewatering fig 2g h applying the protective dissipation of heat energy by balancing between regulated non photochemical energy loss and other losses for the basic or original chlf parameters fig 3 a h we found that minimal fluorescence parameters in dark adapted leaves f o increased with the drought episodes and subsequent rewatering both minimal fluorescence parameters f o and f o in dark and light adapted leaves peaked during the early leaf growing stage and then maintained a relatively stable level until the leaf senesced relative limitation to photosynthesis rlp increased with leaf development and under episodic drought other basic chlfs including f m f m f v f v and f s however showed no systematic responses to the water regimes except their declines at the end of grain filling according to a two way anova table 1 the date i e leaf aging leaf growth stage was associated with significant effects of all the chlf parameters p 0 05 and water alone significantly affected f s f m and q l no significant effects of the interaction of the two main factors were found for all the chlf parameters p 0 05 3 3 growth and morphological responses to drought episodes and rewatering under normal irrigation both total individual plant pla and the single leaf la areas changed as a unimodal form they increased with plant leaf development and peaked on the 81st day after sowing das thereafter decreasing with leaf aging fig 4 a b leaf area was not affected by the shorter duration drought t1 but it sharply declined under the longer duration drought and post rewatering fig 4a both episodic drought stresses resulted in marked declines in the entire individual plant leaf area with a sharp reduction at the end of the longer duration drying the 81st das fig 4b plant height was also significantly reduced by both episodic drought stresses and rewatering did not restore it especially when plants were subjected to the longer drying stress in the t2 treatment fig 4c compared to the control treatment the leaf rolling index lri sharply increased with persistent drought particularly under the longer drying stress fig s2 after rewatering however it rapidly and sensitively decreased fig 4d it is indicated that lri could accurately track the changing water status the two way anova test showed that the two main factors i e water date leaf age and their interaction all significantly affected the total individual plant leaf area and the single leaf area plant height and lri p 0 05 table 1 except the interactive effect on the leaf area f 1 55 p 0 181 compared with the control treatment the biomass of t1 and t2 decreased by 15 3 and 23 5 in 2015 29 5 and 53 4 in 2016 respectively and the grain yield decreased by 25 1 and 27 1 in 2015 26 4 and 54 3 in 2016 fig 5 3 4 analysis of multiple functional traits under the treated conditions relationships between the traits were tested by pearson correlation either across the entire leaf lifespan or at a severely drought stressed stage 81 das relationships between the morphological and chlf parameters of these tagged leaves are presented in table 2 over the entire leaf lifespan table 2 bottom left part the spad values were significantly and positively correlated with f v f m r 0 65 p 0 001 and f m f o r 0 72 p 0 001 la was significantly and positively correlated with most of the psii yields including φpsii f v f m and f m f o p 0 05 however compared to la plant height had antagonistic associations with the same parameters lri s strong negative relationships with spad and pla were observed whereas no significant relationships with chlfs occurred during episodic drought similar associations between these traits were observed except some became stronger such as those of spad with lri pla la f v f m and f m f o table 2 upper right part the relationships between chlfs are also listed for the two data groups in table 2 a pca on leaf chlf and morphological and plant leaf growth traits across the whole growing period was further conducted to test the traits associations and the combined effects of watering regimes and leaf aging it showed that the first two principal components pcs together explained 67 7 of the total variation of the functional traits fig 6 the loadings of the relative chlorophyll content spad readings leaf area and psii photochemical efficiency traits were almost in quadrant i with npq and φnpq in quadrant ii and these markers represent relative limitations in photosynthetic capacity plant height and leaf rolling status were in quadrant iii while the most basic initial chlfs were in quadrant iv obviously separating the distribution patterns in traits under watering conditions at different leaf development stages fig 6a the three parameters i e φpsii φnpq and φno were distributed in the different quadrants indicating heat energy s compensatory effects on photochemical and non photochemical yields for dissipation by downregulation or other losses pc1 had a strong positive correlation with spad fv fm and fm fo while pc2 had a strong positive correlation with fv fm φpsii fv and fm the latter represents these values in light adapted leaves projection of the water status conditions and leaf aging demonstrated that the different leaf development stages were distributed typically in the coordinate plane with scores during the initial leaf growth stage in quadrant iv those at the end of the leaf growth stage in the left part and those during major developmental stages in the upper part fig 6b it indicated that the effects differed profoundly due to combined factors and leaf aging or its developmental stages may play a vital role in the response of maize functional traits to precipitation regimes 4 discussion in the present study chlf responses to drought episodes were monitored progressively in the same leaf with plant development the current results found that chlorophyll content and key photosynthetic potentials such as f v f m and φpsii could be inhibited due to severe episodic drought increases in both npq and its component φnpq during drought imply the psii apparatus has photoprotective properties subsequent rewatering could restore part of the photosynthetic functions in terms of chlf which is closely associated with leaf age plant biomass and grain yield were also severely limited by the longer episodic drought 4 1 nonphotochemical quenching npq crop leaves can dissipate excess energy as heat by a photoprotective mechanism which would reduce crop yield by 20 under field conditions kromdijk et al 2016 indicated by an increase in the npq of chlorophyll fluorescence murchie and lawson 2013 this process is involved in the xanthophyll a kind of carotenoid cycle npq increases with promoting conversion of the de epoxidation of violaxanthin to antheraxanthin and zeaxanthin nilkens et al 2010 murchie and lawson 2013 however an enhanced npq may be at the a net expense at a given light intensity thus weakening the carbon fixation capacity hubbart et al 2012 murchie and lawson 2013 kromdijk et al 2016 most drought stress studies have found that a decrease in the ability to harmlessly dissipate excess energy is often accompanied by a decline in npq e g golan et al 2006 xu et al 2008 npq increases under moderate water stress conditions but decreases under severe water stress marques da silva and arrabaca 2004 our results showed that a 20 day drought episode from the peak vegetative growth stage jointing to tasselling can markedly trigger the npq increase highlighting photoprotection occurrence through the npq pathway figs 2 and 7 additionally rewatering led to a decline in npq implying a relaxation process exists with water status fluctuations this may increase energy conversion from heat dissipation into co2 fixation subsequently increasing photosynthetic efficiency rohéček 2002 murchie and lawson 2013 kromdijk et al 2016 4 2 entire dissipative process a unity can be described as the total yields for dissipative processes for the energy absorbed by psii φpsii φnpq and φno fig 7 schematically depicts energy partitioning between the three fractions φpsii φnpq and φno i e the compensatory activation of the photochemical process in relation to the xanthophyll cycle and psbs role under drought and subsequent rewatering a decrease in φnpq and increase in φno has been found under salt stress yuan et al 2014 and chilling stress riva roveda et al 2016 indicating the damage to psii rather than protection under the two abiotic stresses the present results found a decline in φpsii during both persistent drought episodes however an increase in φnpq and decline in φno occurred simultaneously indicating the protective and productive dissipation of heat energy in the younger leaves stressed through enhancing the regulated non photochemical energy loss in psii fig 2 7 moinuddin et al 2017 moreover when the plants were re watered following a pre drought episode a partial restoration in φpsii occurred but φnpq decreased and φno increased fig 2 in which a weakened xanthophyll cycle and depressed psbs protein expression may be involved fig 7 e g murchie and lawson 2013 kromdijk et al 2016 sacharz et al 2017 4 3 other chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters in the present experiment q l rapidly decreased when plants were subjected to an early drought whereas npq rose to avoid damaging photosynthetic organelles fig 2d kramer et al 2004 xu et al 2008 rewatering induced the increases in q l even exceeding those of the control treatment implicating the compensatory effect on the fraction of psii centers in open states benefitting photochemistry efficiency relative limitation to photosynthesis rlp which is expressed as a relative limitation in photosynthetic performance relative to a normal model leaf schreiber et al 1994 was strongly and negatively correlated with φpsii and positively with npq and φnpq fig 6 table 2 implying it may be recognized as a better proxy of a feasible balance between photochemistry efficiency and heat dissipation energy in the photosystem previously significant changes in fv f m have been widely used to assess species tolerance due to environmental stress factors such as drought and drought induced senescence e g xu et al 2008 a close linear relationship between either f v or f m and zeaxanthin content would implicate the xanthophyll cycle s involvement in protecting the photosynthetic apparatus against excessive light inhibition related to drought response products of signals such as aba schwarz et al 2014 the present results indicated that an increase in initial fluorescence f o versus decreases in fv f m and φpsii with the longer drought episode may imply potential damage to psii figs 2 and 3 and see franklin et al 1992 however when the early drought was imposed increases in both f o and f m and a greater increase in the latter induced an increase in f v possibly reflecting the photoprotective adaptation to psii figs 2 and 3 schwarz et al 2014 furthermore some other conventional chlf parameters such as f s and light adapted parameters i e f o f v and f m do not efficiently reflect environmental stress such as drought episodes fig 3 baker 2008 which needs to be analyzed further on a larger scale such as in canopies and ecosystems and even globally e g kalaji et al 2014 pollastrini et al 2016 yang et al 2017 4 4 leaf chlorophyll content spad readings the spad tool has been extensively used to determine crops responses to environmental variables and their adaptability ciganda et al 2009 pour aboughadareh et al 2017 prior results have indicated that the values would accurately represent realistic chlorophyll content when the realistic chlorophyll content of green leaves remains at a relatively low level steele et al 2008 ciganda et al 2009 however the species leaf structure traits leaf chlorophyll distribution and growth stages may together play important roles in the relationship between spad values and the realistic chlorophyll content determined by the conventional extraction method yamamoto et al 2002 the current study s experimental results indicate spad values could accurately track changes in leaf chlorophyll content which decreases with leaf age fig 2a in which the leaf color obviously also changed accordingly the green color gradually disappeared with leaf age field chlorophyll measurements suggested that tissue nitrogen concentrations derived by a spad chlorophyll meter at v10 and silking stages were a good predictor of grain yield wood et al 1992 it is partly confirmed by the present results which indicate a drought stricken decline in spad values from v11 to vt stages 4 5 growth stage effects the drought episode that occurred during jointing v11 silking r1 stages in the current experiment may adversely affect these processes including normal floral formation meiosis and ovary development consequently leading to a marked loss of yield barnabás et al 2008 mi et al 2017 moreover efeoglu et al 2009 found that drought stress can induce declines in f v f m φpsii and q p but increase the npq of maize leaves decreased photosynthetic efficiency due to drought stress fig 2 may conversely further reduce drought tolerance liu et al 2016 and exacerbate the limitation of leaf plant growth tissue carbohydrate accumulation and its subsequent translocation into grain fig 4 barnabás et al 2008 mi et al 2017 however psii photochemistry efficiency indicated by f v f m φpsii and q p could be only partly restored when rewatering is imposed fig 2 see also efeoglu et al 2009 xu et al 2009 sun et al s 2016 results showed that rewatering following drought stress may stimulate various metabolic activities in maize plants to return to their initially normal status this may strongly depend on the drought s historical status such as the stress severity duration or both xu et al 2010 sun et al 2016 thus both pre drought limitations and the subsequent rewatering recovery ability may finally become the crucial determinants of the photosynthetic process and other key relevant metabolic activities and consequently growth and even productivity leading to grain yield losses of 25 1 and 27 1 in 2015 26 4 and 54 3 in 2016 under t1 and t2 treatments relative to normal irrigation respectively under the same treatments 27 day drought treatment over two years the yield declines of two different varieties were the same 27 1 in 2015 and 26 4 in 2016 nevertheless improvements in the plant senescence process via genetic manipulation and saving water practices in the field might enable major crops to cope effectively with various drought events particularly under climatic change rivero et al 2007 zhao et al 2016 4 6 relationships reportedly spad readings were closely correlated with f v f m in carica papaya leaves indicating that the spad 502 chlorophyll meter might enable researchers to assess the potential efficiency of psii photochemistry particularly under environmental stress conditions such as excessive heat sharma et al 2015 in the current results there were significant and positive relationships between spad values and f v f m but not with φpsii indicating that the photosynthetic potentials in dark adapted leaves may be a proxy for leaf chlorophyll content particularly with stressful factors such as drought table 2 excessive heat sharma et al 2015 and nutritional deficits singh et al 2017 furthermore there was a significant positive association between spad and f m f o p 0 05 indicating this chlf parameter may be representative of leaf chlorophyll content table 2 a principal component analysis also highlights the relationships between the traits and the important role of leaf aging fig 6 thus spad and some key chlfs could be considered relative accurate indices of stress which may be useful in predicting losses in crop grain yield under extreme climatic events prior to harvest in conclusion the main findings were as follows i the negative effects in chlorophyll a fluorescence occurred when drought episodes occurred in the youngest and fully expanded leaves largely supporting our first hypothesis ii a photoprotection rather than inhibition of psii photochemistry was obtained under drought during the plants juvenile stage significantly negating the second hypothesis iii this inhibition from pre drought conditions could be partly ameliorated by rewatering partly confirming the third hypothesis furthermore iv adaptive responses to changing water status would be closely associated with leaf development processes the current major findings may be useful for better understanding the underlying mechanism of photochemical responses to drought history and subsequent rewatering particularly leaf aging under the rapidly changing climatic context authors contributions xz and zg conceived and designed the

economic water use efficiency wuee ww sm and ww sm sm had the higher value ww and sm had the lower value the differences for the different cropping systems were mostly caused by the grain yield and

that apsim model was able to predict the grain yield crop water uptake of wheat and maize in response to water supply in ncp during the past 30 years the release of new cultivars for winter wheat and summer maize were frequently occurred for the long term simulations the modern summer maize cultivar and spring maize cultivar zd958 and wheat cultivars sx733 were used with cultivar parameters

condition for both winter wheat and summer maize 2 5 net water use the potential changes in groundwater level due to the irrigation can be simply calculated as 1 δ h n w u μ where h is the change of groundwater table m nwu is the net water use m which is determined by the irrigation amount and the deep drainage μ is the aquifer specific yield and is set to 0 15 according to guo et al 2010 grain yield reduction gyr under ww sm ww sm sm cropping systems relative to ww sm was calculated as follows 2 g y r y c k y c i y c k where yck is the grain yields under the ww sm cropping system yci was the grain yield under ww sm ww sm sm cropping systems 2 6 water use efficiency water use efficiency wue and the economic water use efficiency wuee were calculated according to following eqs 3 and 4 3 w u e g y e t a 4 w u e e i c e t a 5 w u e t g y t where wuee is the economic water use efficiency yuan m3 ic is the income from the grain yield yuan eta is the actual evapotranspiration mm grain

software version 15 0 differences among the treatments were determined using one way analysis of variance anova means were separated by fisher s least significant difference lsd and were considered significant for an alpha α value of 0 05 3 results 3 1 water consumption et e t and t et for the different cropping systems under the different irrigation schedules are shown in table 3 there was clear trend for et t and the ratio of t et under the different irrigation schedules which was increased with the irrigation amount increased et for the ww sm in two years ranged from 1008 mm to 1485 mm which was similar to the 734 mm annual eta found by luo et al 2018 for et there were significantly differences among the different cropping systems under the four irrigation schedules p 0 05 ww sm had the highest et and which was 1 34 times 1 26 times and 1 13 times higher than that of the ww sm and ww sm sm respectively at the rf condition there wasn t significantly difference between ww and sm monoculture systems which was caused by the similar precipitation in the whole year sun et al 2010 the ratio of t et ranged from 52 08 to 61 04 under the different irrigation schedules for the different cropping systems the ratio of t et also showed significantly difference the ww cropping system had the least t et and then the sm cropping system and the ww sm sm cropping system the ww sm had the most t et under different irrigation schedules this indicated that most of the precipitation and irrigation could be used by the planting crops and the fallow would result in the less t et compared to the change trend of et there was opposite trend for the e under the different irrigation schedules for e there were similar trends for the different cropping systems under the different irrigation schedules the ww cropping system had the most e and the ww sm had the least e under different irrigation schedules this mainly was caused by the different precipitation distribution and the different canopy cover zhang et al 2013a b 3 2 grain yield grain yield for four different cropping systems under four different irrigation schedules are shown in table 4 grain yield had the similar trends for the different cropping systems under different irrigation schedules which were increased with irrigation amount increased there were the highest grain yields for the ww sm cropping system under the four irrigation schedules which ranged from 12 040 7 kg ha per two years and 19 732 1 kg ha per two year grain yield for the ww sm sm and sm cropping systems varied between 11 427 6 kg ha per two years and 15 472 7 kg ha per two year and between 9748 8 kg ha per two years and 11 234 6 kg ha per two year there were the lowest grain yield for the ww cropping system which ranged from 8762 6 kg ha per two years and 10 238 6 kg ha per two year there wasn t significantly difference among the ww sm ww sm sm and sm cropping sytem under the rf conditions results also showed that winter wheat and summer maize in the monoculture system had the higher grain yield than that in the double cropping system this indicated the crop production was mainly limited by the water light and heat resources in the ncp compared to the ww sm cropping system grain yield reduction gyr for the ww sm and ww sm sm cropping systems ranged from 21 59 to 48 11 from 16 71 to 46 93 from 15 82 to 43 92 and from 5 09 to 27 22 under the ni ci mi and rf irrigation schedules respectively the corresponding irrigation amount for the ww sm and ww sm sm cropping systems ranged from 46 88 to 48 55 from 25 00 to 48 44 from 1 00 to 47 39 under the ni ci and mi irrigation schedules respectively this result was similar to the founding by meng et al 2012 who showed the gyr was between 16 and 31 compared to the ni gyr for the ww sm ww sm and ww sm sm cropping system was between 1 09 and 8 49 between 2 41 and 9 1 between 13 23 and 38 98 under ci mi and rf conditions this result indicated that gyr for the different cropping systems were decreased with irrigation amount decreased 3 3 water use efficiency the responses of water use efficiency wue to different cropping systems and irrigation schedules are shown in table 5 the value of wue ranged from 0 87 kg m 3 to 1 33 kg m 3 all the treatments showed the same trend i e wue decreased with the irrigation amount increasing the mean value of wue for ni ci mi and rf was 1 10 kg m 3 1 08 kg m 3 1 07 kg m 3 and 0 97 kg m 3 respectively for the different cropping systems there were significantly differences under the four irrigation schedules wm cropping system had the highest wue and ww had the lowest wue one possible reason is the maize had the higher wue than that of winter wheat which was caused by the higher stomatal resistance for c4 plants farquhar et al 1982 tanner and sinclair 1983 as for the economic water use efficiency wuee there wasn t significantly difference among the ni ci and mi conditions for the mean value of the four cropping systems there also weren t significantly difference between the ww sm and ww sm sm cropping system under the four irrigation schedules although the value of wuee under ww sm was higher than that under ww sm sm cropping system there was similar value under the ww and sm monoculture systems which were lower than that under ww sm and ww sm sm cropping systems for the irrigation schedules the deficit irrigation including mi and ci which was similar to that under ni treatment had the higher value of wuee compared to the rf this indicated that the deficit irrigation could get the more wuee than that under the sufficient irrigation and rf conditions for the water use efficiency of transpiration wuet there was significantly difference among the different cropping systems ww cropping system had the highest value with a mean value of 4 25 kg m3 and the sm cropping system had the lowest value with a mean value of 2 82 kg m3 the value of the wuet for ww sm and ww sm sm cropping system was 3 71 kg m3 and 3 39 kg m3 however there wasn t significantly difference among the different irrigation schedules which was caused by the precipitation and soil water supply fig 1 3 4 groundwater the simulated annual groundwater table changes for the different cropping systems under ni ci mi and rf from 1982 to 2013 were shown in fig 2 there was a significantly decline trend for the groundwater table with the irrigation amount increase the total groundwater table decline for the ww sm ww sm ww sm sm cropping systems under ni from 1982 to 2013 was 39 6 m 1 93 m 6 0 m and 21 6 m respectively under ci conditions the total groundwater table decline for the ww sm ww sm ww sm sm cropping systems was 28 7 m 6 1 m 3 4 m and 18 1 m respectively there was similar trend under mi conditions with that under ci conditions however there was significantly difference under rf conditions the total groundwater table decline for the ww sm ww sm ww sm sm cropping systems was 1 7 m 13 0 m 6 9 m and 2 2 m respectively the most difference for the total groundwater decline was 41 3 m between ni and rf for the ww sm cropping system the most difference for the total groundwater decline for the different cropping systems was 37 7 m under ni conditions the annual decline rate for groundwater table for the ww sm ww sm ww sm sm cropping systems under ni from 1982 to 2013 was 1 24 m a 0 06 m a 0 19 m a and 0 67 m a for the ci irrigation schedule the annual decline rate for groundwater table for the ww sm ww sm ww sm sm cropping systems from 1982 to 2013 was 0 89 m a 0 19 m a 0 11 m a and 0 57 m a for the rf conditions the annual decline rate for groundwater table for the ww sm ww sm ww sm sm cropping systems from 1982 to 2013 was 0 05 m a 0 40 m a 0 22 m a and 0 07 m a the different cropping systems under rf conditions would be benefit to the groundwater table recovery especially for the monoculture system this simulated results showed that the different irrigation schedules and the different cropping system all had the significantly impact on the groundwater decline for the different cropping system the monoculture cropping system under the different irrigation schedules had the least impact on the groundwater table decline the changes of groundwater table for the two monoculture cropping systems had the similar trends under the different irrigation schedules ww cropping system had the less impact on groundwater table decline compared to the sm cropping system the cropping systems of three crops in two years had the moderate impact on the groundwater table decline 4 discussion and conclusion in this study our results showed that the cropping system and irrigation schedules both could reduce the irrigation water use ww sm rotation under ni irrigation schedule had the greatest annual eta with 743 mm which was 1 34 times 1 27 times and 1 13 times higher than that of the ww sm and ww sm sm respectively gyr for the ww sm and ww sm sm cropping systems compared to ww sm cropping system was between 21 59 and 48 11 meanwhile water consumption and gyr under different cropping systems was decreased with irrigation amount decreased meanwhile there were significantly differences for wue of the different cropping systems under the four irrigation schedules wm cropping system had the highest wue and ww had the lowest wue there wasn t significantly difference among the ni ci and mi conditions for the mean value of the four cropping systems there also weren t significantly difference between the ww sm and ww sm sm cropping system under the four irrigation schedules there was significantly difference among the different cropping systems in which ww cropping system had the highest value with a mean value of 4 25 kg m3 and the sm cropping system had the lowest value with a mean value of 2 82 kg m3 there were similar trends of the groundwater table decline for the different cropping systems under different irrigation schedules for the cropping systems there was the most groundwater table decline under the ww sm cropping system and the least groundwater table decline under the ww cropping system under the ni irrigation schedule the ww sm rotation resulted in a corroborated annual average groundwater table decline up to 1 25 m year which was deeper by 22 69 times 5 68 times and 1 85 times than projected declines in the ww sm and ww sm sm respectively the sustainable cropping system in ncp is being increasing challenged by the available water resources and climate change cropping system innovation deficit irrigation technologies and improved agronomic practices were used to reduce water usage and improve grain yield zhang et al 2003 meng et al 2017 there will be a grain yield reduction in varying degrees when the traditional cropping system changed and water saving irrigation schedules applied sun et al 2011 meng et al 2012 luo et al 2018 for the changes of cropping systems winter wheat was considered as the most contributors for the groundwater table decline and then the sowing area reduction was applied however the ncp is the main production area for winter wheat which accounted for about 71 of wheat production in china sun et al 2006 and should be self sufficient then the reduced wheat planting area should be considered according to the requirement of populations and the optimal winter wheat planting area could ensure the safety for the grain rations meanwhile the optimal practices would adapt to the corresponding cropping systems which included the optimized cultivars planting dates planting density and water management meng et al 2017 new cropping systems such as sweet potato millet peanut and soybean and so on had been studied to replace the traditional winter wheat summer maize cropping system wu et al 2008 ma et al 2008 yang et al 2015a b meng et al 2017 investigated the double maize cropping system which could improve yield by 14 31 and had the sustainable water usage compared with the ww sm cropping system most of the new cropping system could significantly reduce the irrigation water usage and improve the grain yield the optimal irrigation schedules adapted to the different cropping systems should also be applied the precipitation varied from year to year the irrigation schedules have to be prepared for different levels of dependable rainfall and use the appropriate one meanwhile the optimal irrigations according to different sensitivity during the different growing stages of the crops were also developed such as the insufficient irrigation and the regulated deficit irrigation rdi when the traditional cropping system of ww sm changed to the cropping system which didn t include the winter wheat there would be some environmental impact firstly there also was 100 mm soil evaporation which was similar to the precipitation during the winter wheat growing season then this water would be useless because it didn t produce the grain yield secondly winter wheat was one of the drought resistant crop and ecological crop winter wheat could mulch the soil and prevent the dust storm occurred in the winter and spring seasons therefore we think there should plant winter wheat and develop the deficit irrigation during the winter wheat growing season meanwhile the winter wheat summer maize cropping system will have to be replaced in the future van oort et al 2016 the most possible crop management option would be rainfed production then if the monoculture system would be developed then there would be more precipitation recharge into groundwater which would result in the lift of groundwater normally the groundwater lift would be good side to the environments however there also would be some negative effects in the coast region which had the possibility to lead secondary salinization soil evaporation is non benefit for the agricultural production which was about 100 mm 120 mm during the fallow period then how we can storage this water into soil and make it be used by the crops is a very important issue current practices including the mulching could reduce the evaporation by 30 50 and which would increase with the further technologies development gan et al 2013 however the materials of mulching should be considered such as the plastic film straw and so on the plastic film mulching may create the new environmental problems liu et al 2014 the straw mulching is an efficient method which not only to reduce the soil evaporation but also improve the soil fertility yang et al 2015a b with the reduction of irrigation application the n input would be reduced the positive effects are to reduce the n loss to the atmosphere and to the groundwater which resulted in the less impact on environment

11298,water shortage is the most limiting factors for the crop production in the north china plain ncp the alternative cropping systems and the water saving irrigation schedules are the main measures

economic water use efficiency wuee ww sm and ww sm sm had the higher value ww and sm had the lower value the differences for the different cropping systems were mostly caused by the grain yield and the soil evaporation meanwhile the water saving irrigation schedules and cropping systems both could reduce the groundwater table decline compared to that under normal irrigation and traditional cropping system there all had the significant impact on groundwater table changes for both the irrigation schedules and cropping systems however water restriction will lead to crop yield reduction and

condition for both winter wheat and summer maize 2 5 net water use the potential changes in groundwater level due to the irrigation can be simply calculated as 1 δ h n w u μ where h is the change of groundwater table m nwu is the net water use m which is determined by the irrigation amount and the deep drainage μ is the aquifer specific yield and is set to 0 15 according to guo et al 2010 grain yield reduction gyr under ww sm ww sm sm cropping systems relative to ww sm was calculated as follows 2 g y r y c k y c i y c k where yck is the grain yields under the ww sm cropping system yci was the grain yield under ww sm ww sm sm cropping systems 2 6 water use efficiency water use efficiency wue and the economic water use efficiency wuee were calculated according to following eqs 3 and 4 3 w u e g y e t a 4 w u e e i c e t a 5 w u e t g y t where wuee is the economic water use efficiency yuan m3 ic is the income from the grain yield yuan eta is the actual evapotranspiration mm grain price were based on the current local market prices in 2016 which were rmb 2400 t and rmb 1600 t for wheat and maize respectively 2 7 data statistical methods statistical analyses were done using spss software version 15 0 differences among the treatments were determined using one way analysis of variance anova means were separated by fisher s least significant difference lsd and were considered significant for an alpha α value of 0 05 3 results 3 1 water consumption et e t and t et for the different cropping systems under the different irrigation schedules are shown in table 3 there was clear trend for et t and the ratio of t et under the different irrigation schedules which was increased with the irrigation amount increased et for the ww sm in two years ranged from 1008 mm to 1485 mm which was similar to the 734 mm annual eta found by luo et al 2018 for et there were significantly differences among the different cropping systems under the four irrigation schedules p 0 05 ww sm had the highest et and which was 1 34 times 1 26 times and 1 13 times higher than that of the ww sm and ww sm sm respectively at the rf condition there wasn t significantly difference between ww and sm monoculture systems which was caused by the similar precipitation in the whole year sun et al 2010 the ratio of t et ranged from 52 08 to 61 04 under the different irrigation schedules for the different cropping systems the ratio of t et also showed significantly difference the ww cropping system had the least t et and then the sm cropping system and the ww sm sm cropping system the ww sm had the most t et under different irrigation schedules this indicated that most of the precipitation and irrigation could be used by the planting crops and the fallow would result in the less t et compared to the change trend of et there was opposite trend for the e under the different irrigation schedules for e there were similar trends for the different cropping systems under the different irrigation schedules the ww cropping system had the most e and the ww sm had the least e under different irrigation schedules this mainly was caused by the different precipitation distribution and the different canopy cover zhang et al 2013a b 3 2 grain yield grain yield for four different cropping systems under four different irrigation schedules are shown in table 4 grain yield had the similar trends for the different cropping systems under different irrigation schedules which were increased with irrigation amount increased there were the highest grain yields for the ww sm cropping system under the four irrigation schedules which ranged from 12 040 7 kg ha per two years and 19 732 1 kg ha per two year grain yield for the ww sm sm and sm cropping systems varied between 11 427 6 kg ha per two years and 15 472 7 kg ha per two year and between 9748 8 kg ha per two years and 11 234 6 kg ha per two year there were the lowest grain yield for the ww cropping system which ranged from 8762 6 kg ha per two years and 10 238 6 kg ha per two year there wasn t significantly difference among the ww sm ww sm sm and sm cropping sytem under the rf conditions results also showed that winter wheat and summer maize in the monoculture system had the higher grain yield than that in the double cropping system this indicated the crop production was mainly limited by the water light and heat resources in the ncp compared to the ww sm cropping system grain yield reduction gyr for the ww sm and ww sm sm cropping systems ranged from 21 59 to 48 11 from 16 71 to 46 93 from 15 82 to 43 92 and from 5 09 to 27 22 under the ni ci mi and rf irrigation schedules respectively the corresponding irrigation amount for the ww sm and ww sm sm cropping systems ranged from 46 88 to 48 55 from 25 00 to 48 44 from 1 00 to 47 39 under the ni ci and mi irrigation schedules respectively this result was similar to the founding by meng et al 2012 who showed the gyr was between 16 and 31 compared to the ni gyr for the ww sm ww sm and ww sm sm cropping system was between 1 09 and 8 49 between 2 41 and 9 1 between 13 23 and 38 98 under ci mi and rf conditions this result indicated that gyr for the different cropping systems were decreased with irrigation amount decreased 3 3 water use efficiency the responses of water use efficiency wue to different cropping systems and irrigation schedules are shown in table 5 the value of wue ranged from 0 87 kg m 3 to 1 33 kg m 3 all the treatments showed the same trend i e wue decreased with the irrigation amount increasing the mean value of wue for ni ci mi and rf was 1 10 kg m 3 1 08 kg m 3 1 07 kg m 3 and 0 97 kg m 3 respectively for the different cropping systems there were significantly differences under the four irrigation schedules wm cropping system had the highest wue and ww had the lowest wue one possible reason is the maize had the higher wue than that of winter wheat which was caused by the higher stomatal resistance for c4 plants farquhar et al 1982 tanner and sinclair 1983 as for the economic water use efficiency wuee there wasn t significantly difference among the ni ci and mi conditions for the mean value of the four cropping systems there also weren t significantly difference between the ww sm and ww sm sm cropping system under the four irrigation schedules although the value of wuee under ww sm was higher than that under ww sm sm cropping system there was similar value under the ww and sm monoculture systems which were lower than that under ww sm and ww sm sm cropping systems for the irrigation schedules the deficit irrigation including mi and ci which was similar to that under ni treatment had the higher value of wuee compared to the rf this indicated that the deficit irrigation could get the more wuee than that under the sufficient irrigation and rf conditions for the water use efficiency of transpiration wuet there was significantly difference among the different cropping systems ww cropping system had the highest value with a mean value of 4 25 kg m3 and the sm cropping system had the lowest value with a mean value of 2 82 kg m3 the value of the wuet for ww sm and ww sm sm cropping system was 3 71 kg m3 and 3 39 kg m3 however there wasn t significantly difference among the different irrigation schedules which was caused by the precipitation and soil water supply fig 1 3 4 groundwater the simulated annual groundwater table changes for the different cropping systems under ni ci mi and rf from 1982 to 2013 were shown in fig 2 there was a significantly decline trend for the groundwater table with the irrigation amount increase the total groundwater table decline for the ww sm ww sm ww sm sm cropping systems under ni from 1982 to 2013 was 39 6 m 1 93 m 6 0 m and 21 6 m respectively under ci conditions the total groundwater table decline for the ww sm ww sm ww sm sm cropping systems was 28 7 m 6 1 m 3 4 m and 18 1 m respectively there was similar trend under mi conditions with that under ci conditions however there was significantly difference under rf conditions the total groundwater table decline for the ww sm ww sm ww sm sm cropping systems was 1 7 m 13 0 m 6 9 m and 2 2 m respectively the most difference for the total groundwater decline was 41 3 m between ni and rf for the ww sm cropping system the most difference for the total groundwater decline for the different cropping systems was 37 7 m under ni conditions the annual decline rate for groundwater table for the ww sm ww sm ww sm sm cropping systems under ni from 1982 to 2013 was 1 24 m a 0 06 m a 0 19 m a and 0 67 m a for the ci irrigation schedule the annual decline rate for groundwater table for the ww sm ww sm ww sm sm cropping systems from 1982 to 2013 was 0 89 m a 0 19 m a 0 11 m a and 0 57 m a for the rf conditions the annual decline rate for groundwater table for the ww sm ww sm ww sm sm cropping systems from 1982 to 2013 was 0 05 m a 0 40 m a 0 22 m a and 0 07 m a the different cropping systems under rf conditions would be benefit to the groundwater table recovery especially for the monoculture system this simulated results showed that the different irrigation schedules and the different cropping system all had the significantly impact on the groundwater decline for the different cropping system the monoculture cropping system under the different irrigation schedules had the least impact on the groundwater table decline the changes of groundwater table for the two monoculture cropping systems had the similar trends under the different irrigation schedules ww cropping system had the less impact on groundwater table decline compared to the sm cropping system the cropping systems of three crops in two years had the moderate impact on the groundwater table decline 4 discussion and conclusion in this study our results showed that the cropping system and irrigation schedules both could reduce the irrigation water use ww sm rotation under ni irrigation schedule had the greatest annual eta with 743 mm which was 1 34 times 1 27 times and 1 13 times higher than that of the ww sm and ww sm sm respectively gyr for the ww sm and ww sm sm cropping systems compared to ww sm cropping system was between 21 59 and 48 11 meanwhile water consumption and gyr under different cropping systems was decreased with irrigation amount decreased meanwhile there were significantly differences for wue of the different cropping systems under the four irrigation schedules wm cropping system had the highest wue and ww had the lowest wue there wasn t significantly difference among the ni ci and mi conditions for the mean value of the four cropping systems there also weren t significantly difference between the ww sm and ww sm sm cropping system under the four irrigation schedules there was significantly difference among the different cropping systems in which ww cropping system had the highest value with a mean value of 4 25 kg m3 and the sm cropping system had the lowest value with a mean value of 2 82 kg m3 there were similar trends of the groundwater table decline for the different cropping systems under different irrigation schedules for the cropping systems there was the most groundwater table decline under the ww sm cropping system and the least groundwater table decline under the ww cropping system under the ni irrigation schedule the ww sm rotation resulted in a corroborated annual average groundwater table decline up to 1 25 m year which was deeper by 22 69 times 5 68 times and 1 85 times than projected declines in the ww sm and ww sm sm respectively the sustainable cropping system in ncp is being increasing challenged by the available water resources and climate change cropping system innovation deficit irrigation technologies and improved agronomic practices were used to reduce water usage and improve grain yield zhang et al 2003 meng et al 2017 there will be a grain yield reduction in varying degrees when the traditional cropping system changed and water saving irrigation schedules applied sun et al 2011 meng et al 2012 luo et al 2018 for the changes of cropping systems winter wheat was considered as the most contributors for the groundwater table decline and then the sowing area reduction was applied however the ncp is the main production area for winter wheat which accounted for about 71 of wheat production in china sun et al 2006 and should be self sufficient then the reduced wheat planting area should be considered according to the requirement of populations and the optimal winter wheat planting area could ensure the safety for the grain rations meanwhile the optimal practices would adapt to the corresponding cropping systems which included the optimized cultivars planting dates planting density and water management meng et al 2017 new cropping systems such as sweet potato millet peanut and soybean and so on had been studied to replace the traditional winter wheat summer maize cropping system wu et al 2008 ma et al 2008 yang et al 2015a b meng et al 2017 investigated the double maize cropping system which could improve yield by 14 31 and had the sustainable water usage compared with the ww sm cropping system most of the new cropping system could significantly reduce the irrigation water usage and improve the grain yield the optimal irrigation schedules adapted to the different cropping systems should also be applied the precipitation varied from year to year the irrigation schedules have to be prepared for different levels of dependable rainfall and use the appropriate one meanwhile the optimal irrigations according to different sensitivity during the different growing stages of the crops were also developed such as the insufficient irrigation and the regulated deficit irrigation rdi when the traditional cropping system of ww sm changed to the cropping system which didn t include the winter wheat there would be some environmental impact firstly there also was 100 mm soil evaporation which was similar to the precipitation during the winter wheat growing season then this water would be useless because it didn t produce the grain yield secondly winter wheat was one of the drought resistant crop and ecological crop winter wheat could mulch the soil and prevent the dust storm occurred in the winter and spring seasons therefore we think there should plant winter wheat and develop the deficit irrigation during the winter wheat growing season meanwhile the winter wheat summer maize cropping system will have to be replaced in the future van oort et al 2016 the most possible crop management option would be rainfed production then if the monoculture system would be developed then there would be more precipitation recharge into groundwater which would result in the lift of groundwater normally the groundwater lift would be good side to the environments however there also would be some negative effects in the coast region which had the possibility to lead secondary salinization soil evaporation is non benefit for the agricultural production which was about 100 mm 120 mm during the fallow period then how we can storage this water into soil and make it be used by the crops is a very important issue current practices including the mulching could reduce the evaporation by 30 50 and which would increase with the further technologies development gan et al 2013 however the materials of mulching should be considered such as the plastic film straw and so on the plastic film mulching may create the new environmental problems liu et al 2014 the straw mulching is an efficient method which not only to reduce the soil evaporation but also improve the soil fertility yang et al 2015a b with the reduction of irrigation application the n input would be reduced the positive effects are to reduce the n loss to the atmosphere and to the groundwater which resulted in the less impact on environment

11299,assessing crops water use is essential for agricultural water management and planning particularly in water limited regions here we present a biophysical model to estimate crop actual evapotranspiration and root zone soil water content using proximal sensing and meteorological data crop rs met the model which is based on the dual fao56 formulation uses a water deficit factor calculated from rainfall and atmospheric demand information to constrain actual evapotranspiration and soil water content in crops growing under dry conditions we tested the crop rs met model in a dryland experimental field comprising a variety of wheat triticum aestivum l and t durum cultivars with diverse phenology crop rs met was shown to accurately capture seasonal changes in wheat water use during the growing season the average r2 of modeled vs observed soil water content for all cultivars n 11 was 0 92 0 02 with average relative rmse and bias of 9 29 1 30 and 0 13 0 03 respectively we found that changing the integration time period of the water deficit factor in crop rs met affects the accuracy of the model implying that this factor has a vital role in modeling crop water use under dry conditions currently crop rs met has a simple representation of surface runoff and does not take into consideration heterogeneity in the soil profile thus efforts to combine numerical models that simulate soil water dynamics with a crop rs met model driven by high resolution remote sensing data may be needed for a spatially continuous assessment of crop water use in fields with more complex edaphic characteristics keywords crop evapotranspiration et model ndvi proximal sensing soil water content swc wheat 1 introduction water scarcity is a primary limiting factor of crop yield production in dryland regions elliott et al 2014 frieler et al 2017 hoffman et al 2018 leng 2017 wilcox and makowski 2014 zhang et al 2017 estimating available water at the various growing stages of the crop may be therefore a critical issue for an adequate agricultural management in these regions this is primarily essential to improve both crop water use and yield production attia et al 2016 christy et al 2018 rajala et al 2009 an important component in the water budget and thus in calculating the remaining water available for the crop is the actual evapotranspiration et which is the water loss via direct surface evaporation and plant transpiration processes currently farmers use the empirical penman monteith formulation abdelhadi et al 2000 rawat et al 2017 or an alternative atmospheric demand reference et et0 formulation kashyap and panda 2001 for decision making on irrigation practices because estimating et is much more challenging however et0 which is based on the atmospheric demand cannot provide the actual water that is being lost from the field because this loss may be driven by numerous factors other than the atmospheric demand for example seasonal changes in crop water use may be highly constrained by soil moisture conditions and plant growth particularly under water limited conditions akuraju et al 2017 song et al 2018 also vapor pressure deficit has been shown to affect plant growth and stomatal conductance regulating the actual water use of the plant depending on the plant species and soil moisture conditions eamus et al 2008 sanginés de cárcer et al 2018 schoppach and sadok 2012 sinclair et al 2017 these factors which may be important to derive the actual crop water use are not taken directly into consideration when using crop et0 as a replacement to et even after adjusting the et0 with a crop coefficient an accurate et estimation is thus necessary to provide reliable information about the crop water use and crop water productivity i e the amount of biomass produced per unit of water used and the remaining soil water content available for the crop many approaches exist to assess et in crop fields see review in rana and katerji 2000 most of them though require intensive field based measurements and are suitable only for water status monitoring at the plot scale level e g liu et al 2002 lópez urrea et al 2009 to expand these plot based estimations to a wider area models integrating remote sensing rs satellite observations are often used e g helman et al 2017 2015a b and see also glenn et al 2010 for review of methods rs based et models range from simple empirical approaches to very complex models anderson et al 2008 bisquert et al 2016 campos et al 2016 colaizzi et al 2012 nagler et al 2013 su 2002 in between these models a biophysical model combining rs information on plant development and in situ meteorological data rs met was recently proposed for natural vegetation systems helman et al 2017 the rs met model is based on the fao56 formulation allen et al 1998 which uses plant and soil coefficients to describe the ratio of et to et0 throughout the growing season the accuracy of rs met was successfully demonstrated in several natural vegetation systems such as forests woodlands and shrublands by comparing modeled et with et derived using the eddy covariance technique helman et al 2017 in rs met the theoretical plant and soil coefficients of fao56 are replaced by linear functions of the satellite derived normalized difference vegetation index ndvi while ndvi is used as a proxy for plant growth leaf area and canopy developments helman et al 2015a b rs met provides daily et estimates at a spatial resolution of 250 m in natural vegetation water limited environments the satellite derived ndvi is used in rs met as a constraining factor on et when atmospheric demand is high but the canopy is not fully developed to support such a high atmospheric demand moreno et al 2014 a water deficit factor derived from rainfall and et0 was added in rs met to further constrain the modeled et in a case of water limitation the rationale behind using water deficit factors in rs met is based on studies showing that soil moisture conditions may have a strong influence on et in water limited environments akuraju et al 2017 helman et al 2017 maselli et al 2014 though promising rs met only estimates et and not soil water content which is important for irrigation management in crop fields also rs met was designed for natural vegetation systems and not for crops it currently lacks a proper representation of the influence of vapor pressure deficit on stomatal conductance and the interception component of et direct evaporation from the surface of leaves which is the rainwater fraction not reaching the ground these two factors may significantly affect et in crops kang et al 2005 li and rao 2000 in addition using daily satellite derived ndvi as input to the rs met model means degrading the spatial resolution of the model which may be problematic for crop monitoring of small size crop fields helman 2018 accounting for vast areas in some countries burke and lobell 2017 carletto et al 2015 proximal sensing using spectral sensors in the field may be a good solution to overcome the spatio temporal resolution problem lópez urrea et al 2009 proximal sensing has been recently used in precision agriculture to detect stressed areas marino et al 2015 matese et al 2018 assess the spatial variability in crop vigor marino and alvino 2014 aid in within season fertilizer management practices samborski et al 2009 evaluate plant water content mendiguren et al 2015 and improve in season predictions of crop quality and quantity magney et al 2016 it is also vastly used for crop phenotyping deery et al 2014 tattaris et al 2016 bonfil 2017 used a rapidscan sensor for in field phenotyping of a variety of wheat cultivars in israel showing that proximal sensing ndvi may be used to predict grain yield production assisting breeders with in field phenotyping here we aim to provide a simple semi empirical model based on the original rs met with some adjustments for crop fields which may be easily used by farmers for irrigation management purposes we use proximal sensing ndvi in the adjusted version of rs met hereafter crop rs met for the assessment of et and root zone soil water content in an experimental wheat field crop rs met includes a vapor pressure deficit factor and the interception component of et in addition to the water deficit factor already used in the original rs met model we test our crop rs met in a variety of spring wheat 10 triticum aestivum l and one t durum cultivars comprising diverse phenology and compare it with in situ root zone soil water content measurements along the growing season we further examine the effects of vapor pressure deficit and water deficit factors on modeled et in crop rs met 2 data and methods 2 1 experimental field design and wheat cultivars the experimental field is located at the gilat research center of the agricultural research organization southern israel 31 21 n 34 42 e a total of 11 wheat 10 triticum aestivum l and one t durum cultivar varieties with five replicates for each cultivar was tested the experiment included all leading israeli cultivars representing a wide variation in phenology bonfil 2017 each plot replication having an average size of 5 m 2 m was sown to ensure a stand of about 200 plants m 2 in addition to rainfall plots were irrigated before and particularly after the beginning of the heading stage heading occurred between 74 and 88 days after emergence 23 february and 9 march 2014 depending on the wheat cultivar 2 2 soil moisture measurements the soil in gilat experimental field is loess with four layers sandy loam at depths of 0 25 cm sandy loam to loam at 25 55 cm loam at 55 77 cm and loam to clay loam at 77 100 cm the bulk densities of these layers are 1 45 g cm 1 for the top 25 cm 1 30 g cm 1 for the 25 55 cm layer 1 75 g cm 1 for the 55 77 cm layer and 1 80 g cm 1 for the 77 100 cm deep layer electrical conductivity ec ranges from 0 043 s m 1 at the top 25 cm to 0 64 s m 1 at 100 cm depth while carbonate nodules range from 10 g kg 1 at the top 25 cm to 300 g kg 1 at the deep 77 100 cm layer the maximum wetting front depth at gilat typically ranges from approximately 30 cm in dry years to 1 m in wet years amir et al 1991 therefore volumetric soil moisture was measured at intervals of 10 cm to a depth of 1 m in each 5 m 2 m plot using a portable dielectric probe system pr2 profile probe dynamax inc soil water content was also determined gravimetrically in each 5 m 2 m plot using the drying method w w samples 100 g of dry soil were taken at 10 cm increments to a depth of 1 m at the pr2 profile probe intervals a week after emergence and after harvest using a hydraulic auger in order to overcome errors due to a changing distance between the tube and the soil we sampled the soil near the tube 10 cm from the tube several times along the season soil samples were used to calibrate the probe data after normalizing the data using the minimum and maximum obtained values linearly information on the available water from rain and irrigation was used to further constrain the range of the probe data together with estimations from the gravimetric method available soil water was between 7 5 0 03 mpa and up to approximately 15 1 5 mpa finally soil moisture measurements were integrated to represent an average root zone depth of 1 m which is the average root depth of israeli wheat cultivars bonfil et al 1999 soil characteristics were homogeneous across the experimental field thus the 1 m swc was averaged per cultivar over the five plots prior to comparing with modeled swc 2 3 proximal ndvi using rapidscan sensor proximal sensing was conducted in the field using a rapidscan cs 45 sensor holland scientific inc the rapidscan sensor measures crop soil reflectances at three spectral bands 670 nm 730 nm and 780 nm in red red egde and near infrared respectively spectral measurements from rapidscan were recorded by scanning each plot every week at an approximated height of 1 m above the canopy fig 1 where the sensor field of view is approximately 30 14 this height of 1 m was proved to be the best height for spectral measurements according to kipp et al 2014 and following a previous study conducted in this site bonfil 2017 following this information the measured area in each sub plot may be calculated as the plot length multiplied by 0 5 m c 6 m2 in most cases reflectance data were collected throughot the entire growing season from emergence to harvest ndvi was calculated for each plot as ndvi r780 r670 r780 r670 rouse et al 1973 and avereged over the five replicates for each cultivar the weekly ndvi was linearly interpolated to derive daily values important phenological stages like heading and grain filling dates were assessed in the field 2 4 meteorology daily meteorological data were collected from the gilat meteorological station which is located only 5 m from the experiment field provided by the israeli ministry of agriculture http www meteo moag gov il meteorological information included daily summed radiation load mj d 1 daily mean temperature at a standard 2 m height c daily mean relative humidity rh and daily sums of precipitation mm d 1 the vapor pressure deficit vpd was calculated from the saturated vapor pressure for a given temperature following murray et al 1966 and for a given rh the average daily temperature for the growing season was 18 23 c with a maximum and minimum of 24 93 c and 11 52 c respectively mean daily rh was 60 66 with maximum and minimum rh values of 88 44 and 32 87 respectively the water supply from rainfall was 282 10 mm and from irrigation 171 15 mm total of 453 25 mm fig 2 shows meteorological forcing and rapidscan ndvi for bar nir cultivar at the experimental field 3 crop rs met model we adjusted the rs met remote sensing and meteorological et model helman et al 2017 to derive actual et and soil water content swc on a daily basis in fields cultivated with a variety of wheat cultivars 3 1 modeling actual evapotranspiration in crop rs met the original rs met et model is based on the dual crop soil fao56 formulation allen et al 2006 1998 1 et et0 kcb ke where kcb and ke are the basal crop coefficient and the soil evaporation coefficient respectively that represent the ratio of et to et0 which changes along the season due to canopy development and changing soil moisture conditions lu et al 2011 vivoni et al 2008 note that et in eq 1 is actually the standard crop et which becomes the actual crop et once adjusted for water stress conditions the dynamical behavior of these coefficients is represented in rs met by a function of soil moisture conditions f sm and satellite derived ndvi f ndvi the latter is used as a proxy of leaf area index lai f sm is derived using local meteorological information the f sm and f ndvi are used to adjust maximum kcb and ke values taken from a lookup table for the specific plant functional type and soil conditions kcbmax and kemax respectively thus eq 1 in the rs met model becomes 2 et et0 f ndvi f sm kcbmax kemax a linear transformation of ndvi is used in the original rs met model to derive fractional vegetation cover here we used proximal ndvi instead of satellite derived ndvi in a similar linear function we used this linear transformation as a proxy for fractional lai i e flai f ndvi with the daily ndvi derived from proximal sensing in the wheat field 3 flai ndvi ndvisoil ndviveg ndvisoil where ndvisoil and ndviveg are constant values representing ndvi values of bare soil and a fully developed canopy ndvisoil 0 1 and ndviveg 0 85 respectively which were derived from the in field measurements before seeding and at the time when the wheat canopy was fully developed eq 3 is thus defined as the fractional lai representing canopy development and may be used to adjust kcbmax in eq 2 to adjust kemax the complement of flai is used thus eq 2 may be rewritten as follows 4 et et0 f sm flai kcbmax 1 flai kemax next a water deficit factor for root zone f rz and surface f su soil moisture are used to further adjust kcbmax and kemax accounting for the available water for plant transpiration and soil surface evaporation respectively f su is first calculated as the simple ratio of daily water supply ws which is the amount of rainfall p and irrigation irr to daily et0 both cumulated over a defined period of time δ t f su is set to 1 when cumulated ws exceeds the atmospheric demand i e et0 5 f s u t t δ t w s t t δ t e t 0 t t δ t w s t t δ t e t 0 1 t t δ t w s t t δ t e t 0 basically δ t may vary for different crop types and environmental conditions here we used δ t of 15 days but also tested different δ ts 10 20 30 and 45 days to explore the effect of δ t on kc and subsequently on the modeled et and swc f rz is then calculated as a linear function of f su while it is set to vary between 0 5 and 1 6 f rz 0 5 0 5 f su eq 6 means that et may be reduced to no more than half the potential maximum in the absence of water supply simulating basic transpiration levels maintained by crop plants glenn et al 2011 the assumption is that plant tissues are damaged at lower transpiration levels than half the maximum this damage will be then detected through a significant reduction in ndvi and flai which will in turn reduce the modeled et see eq 4 accounting for f su and f rz eq 4 becomes 7 et et0 f rz flai kcbmax f su 1 flai kemax two new additions not present in the original rs met model were included here in crop rs met i a vapor pressure deficit vpd factor fvpd was used to account for vpd effect on stomatal conductance vpd has been shown to be an important parameter affecting stomatal opening and thus a limiting factor for plant transpiration which may be counterbalanced by water availability oren et al 1999 schoppach and sadok 2012 ii interception component of et iet iet is calculated as a function of leaf development i e lai accounting for the direct evaporation from the surface of leaves i e the fraction of p not reaching the ground for i we used the logarithmic function of stomatal conductance response to vpd proposed by oren et al 1999 8 fvpd 1 m ln vpd where m denotes the sensitivity of stomatal conductance to vpd as the natural logarithm per kilopascal m was found to be 0 60 ln kpa for wheat hoshika et al 2017 while a similar value was also previously proposed for other plant functional types oren et al 1999 fvpd is then used in crop rs met to constrain kcbmax through a jarvis type model damour et al 2010 jarvis 1976 in the form 9 et et0 max fvpd f rz flai kcbmax f su 1 flai kemax where the maximum between fvpd and f rz is used to constrains kcbmax instead of a multiplicative function i e fvpd f rz to better represent the tradeoff between water availability and atmospheric control on stomatal conductance hoshika et al 2017 for ii the iet component is calculated as a multiplicative function of p in mm d 1 and flai as follows 10 iet imax p flai where imax is defined as the maximum fraction of p evaporated directly from the surface of a fully developed wheat canopy we used an imax value of 0 25 25 of the p in crop rs met following results from several observational studies on wheat kang et al 2005 li and rao 2000 including eqs 8 10 and integrating all et components in the model et from crop rs met becomes 11 et et0 max fvpd f rz flai kcbmax f su 1 flai kemax iet finally we used a kcbmax value of 1 2 for wheat development allen et al 1998 and a low 0 2 value for kemax following helman et al 2017 and maselli et al 2014 to derive daily estimates of et from eq 11 for each plot and cultivar 3 2 root zone soil water content crop root zone depth is dynamic and changes along the growing season usually until the flowering stage after which it stabilizes swc is simulated in crop rs met as the amount of available water to the roots at a changing root zone depth this is because et in crop rs met does not depend on root depth but is estimated empirically from ndvi as a proxy of leaf expansion and meteorological conditions yet we used swc measurements from the upper 1 m soil layer to validate our model assuming that this was the typical root zone depth along the season the root zone swc in crop rs met was calculated as the accumulated ws minus the daily et the ws was summed throughout the seasonal year accounting for a 5 reduction pr 0 05 ws due to water that seeps underneath the root zone i e 1 m through percolation process note that pr also includes surface runoff in eq 12 which was assumed to be neglectable in our study site 12 s w c t i 0 t w s e t p r 3 3 model uncertainty the main driver of et in crop rs met is et0 eq 11 hence an accurate assessment of et0 is crucial for a correct modeling of et here we calculated et0 using three different methods i the penman monteith pm formulation allen et al 1998 13 e t 0 p m 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t a 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 the pm is considered a standard et0 method and is vastly used worldwide the rn in eq 13 is the net radiation mj m 2 d 1 g is soil heat flux density mj m 2 d 1 ta is the mean daily air temperature c u2 is wind speed at 2 m height m s 1 es and ea are saturation and actual vapor pressures kpa respectively and es ea is the vapor pressure deficit δ is the slope vapor pressure curve kpa c 1 γ is the psychrometric constant kpa c 1 et0 pm was derived in mm d 1 because pm requires many parameters to compute et0 droogers and allen 2002 which are not always available we used also a more simple empirical method to compute et0 ii the jensen and haise 1963 empirical equation jh 14 e t 0 j h r n 2470 0 078 0 0252 t a where ta is the mean daily air temperature c rg is daily global total incoming solar radiation kj m 2 d 1 et0 jh is finally converted into mm d 1 by dividing rg by 2470 mm kj m 2 d 1 eq 13 and jensen and haise 1963 the advantage of the jh method over pm is that it only requires temperature and solar radiation data which may be easily acquired from conventional weather stations and or satellite data iii finally we used pan evaporation to calculate et0 by measuring surface evaporation from evaporation pan epan which was further adjusted to et0 pan with the use of a pan coefficient kp eagleman 1967 15 et0 pan kp epan an average kp value of 0 7 was used throughout the season following recommendations of the israeli meteorological service for gilat to obtain the model uncertainty we averaged the et0 estimated using the three methods eqs 13 15 the model s error was defined as the maximum and minimum et and swc obtained from using the three et0 estimates in eq 11 4 results 4 1 modeling actual evapotranspiration et changed along the season between 0 mm d 1 prior to wheat appearance and up to 7 mm d 1 at the heading stage in all cultivars fig 3 shows an example of daily et derived from crop rs met for a single wheat cultivar bar nir the dominant et component at the start of the growing season from mid to end of december days 70 90 in fig 3 and prior to wheat emergence flai is attributed to soil evaporation it was mostly synchronized with the first rains fig 2 and a slight increase in et0 following a significant gradual increase in et driven by et0 and flai is noted an abrupt decrease in et was then observed towards the end of march around day 180 in fig 3 with a more gradual decrease followed until the end of the growing season day 220 in fig 3 this last gradual decrease in et was despite of a relatively high flai at least until mid april and a significant increase in et0 it followed a long dry period which resulted in significant kcb and consequently et reductions see following fig 5b soil evaporation was significant again but still lower compared to the et at the main growing season at the end of the growing season due to late rains in may compare with fig 2 a sensitivity of flai to et0 was noted at the peak of the growing season as flai decreased by c 0 1 units from day 150 to 163 in fig 3 synchronized with a et0 reduction an abrupt decrease in ndvi and thus in flai during the peak of the growing season was likely due to a lower photosynthetic activity during these days which were cloudy as implied from the low solar radiation load and recorded rainfall mid march rains in fig 2 photosynthetic activity was low due to energy limitation 4 2 soil water content average seasonal changes in swc were between 0 mm3 mm 3 prior to appearance and 2 5 mm3 mm 3 at c 70 days after appearance fig 4 shows the seasonal evolution and baseline comparison of measured vs modeled swc at the top 1 m in the same plot of cultivar bar nir fig 3 the model shows to capture well changes in swc following dry periods rainfall and irrigation it also shows to follow the gradual decrease in observed swc at the end of the growing season the r2 rmse and bias of modeled vs observed swc by cultivars are shown in table 1 the r2 was in the 0 89 0 95 range with an average score of 0 92 0 02 the average relative rmse and bias were low with average scores of 9 29 1 30 and 0 13 0 03 respectively 4 3 changing the water deficit accumulation period in the model changing the accumulation period δ t significantly affected the water deficit factor i e f rz and consequently the kcb kcb refers here to kcb max fvpd f rz flai kcbmax as shown in fig 5 for the same bn cultivar for example by using δ t of 10 and 15 days the f rz was reduced to a minimum c 0 5 at the beginning of the critical heading stage days 129 144 in fig 5a b thus consequently reducing the kcb this kcb reduction resulted in lower modeled et values compare with fig 3 and a more restrained swc decrease which was in accordance to the gradual decrease in observed swc during this period of time see fig 4 using δ t of 20 days shortened the period of the kcb reduction due to the more restrained decrease in the f rz fig 5c while δ t of 30 and 45 days hardly reduced the kcb during this period fig 5d e the f vpd was almost insignificant in regulating the kcb during the entire growing period fig 5 however at the start of the heading stage the f vpd was significant counterbalancing the negative effect that f rz had on kcb fig 5a b this positive effect at the start of the heading stage though was only meaningful for model simulations with δ t of 10 and 15 days but not for model simulations with longer δ t periods fig 5 another effect of δ t was observed at the senescence period during the senescence period kcb was a crucial factor in reducing modeled et that would have been increased without the kcb constraint due to the high flai and increased et0 at this time of the year figs 3 and 5 kcb and consequently the et reductions resulted in a more than expected gradual decrease of modeled swc which was also in accordance with the gradual decrease observed in measured swc at the end of the growing season fig 4 comparing the model performance with the different δ t periods shows that using a δ t of 15 days achieves the best results followed by δ t of 10 and 20 days fig 6 using a δ t of 45 days resulted in a far lower but still highly significant model performance table 2 summarizes the average r2 rmse and bias scores over all cultivars of modeled vs measured swc estimates when using the model with different δ t periods 4 4 end of season soil water content from crop rs met sensors and gravimetric method end of season swc may assist in post season agricultural planning thus we compare our modeled swc with measured swc at the end of the growth season end of season swc was comparable for all cultivars with no significant difference between crop rs met estimates using δ t 15 days and in situ sensor measurements p 0 05 table 3 end of season gravimetric swc estimates were slightly but significantly lower than sensors swc p 0 05 but non significantly lower than crop rs met swc p 0 05 which was within the estimates from the two field based methods table 3 mean end of season swc for all cultivars was quite similar from all methods with 117 18 mm m 3 from crop rs met 121 16 mm m 3 from sensor measurements and 112 9 mm m 3 using the gravimetric method table 3 5 discussion the high accuracy of the crop rs met in assessing root zone swc has been demonstrated in this study in a variety of wheat cultivars the advantage of the crop rs met model is its simplicity and the use of a relatively few parameters that may be easily acquired crop rs met may be used to simulate water constrains on crop growth in process based models bassu et al 2014 jin et al 2016 rosenzweig et al 2014 wang et al 2017 soil water dynamics is an important factor affecting photosynthetic activity and currently many process based models suffer from a poor representation of water dynamics in the soil profile the lack of a proper surface physics simulation such as soil water dynamics may result in model uncertainties particularly in crops growing under water limited conditions rajala et al 2009 crop rs met may provide a simple simulation of surface water dynamics essential for such models e g shelia et al 2018 yin et al 2015 where runoff is insignificant or null as in the case of our study site moreover crop rs met may be easily combined with a simple mechanistic soil water flow model to provide available water at the root zone in fields where runoff is a significant component of the water balance estimating soil water content at the soil profile during critical periods such as wheat heading anthesis and grain filling stages may provide an early prediction of yield production being very important for decision making bonfil et al 2004 helman et al 2018 showed that root zone soil water content at heading is a good estimator of potential end of season wheat grain yield production thus knowing the available water during heading may assist in decision making regarding whether to harvest at an early stage for hay or silage with a lower income or to leave the crop for yield production with the risk of a major economic loss since the test weight is expected to decline from that stage moreover information on soil water content can help in forecasting the need for late nitrogen application that will ensure required protein levels in the wheat bonfil et al 2004 the use of a factor that account for water deficit conditions f su and f rz with a proper integration time period δ t was shown here to be significant in constraining the effects of plant phenology represented by ndvi and atmospheric demand seasonal et0 on et this was particularly essential at both ends of the rainy season adjusting the modeled et to water deficit conditions at the root zone during these periods similar results were obtained in natural water limited environments using the rs met model helman et al 2017 here the role of the water deficit factors was even more noteworthy because it constrained et at the beginning of the rainy season which coincided with the wheat s heading stage constraining modeled et at the heading stage is pivotal because it allows an accurate estimation of soil water content at the root zone during this crucial period this may be essential for a proper irrigation management attia et al 2016 christy et al 2018 and improvement of wheat s grain yield production lópez urrea et al 2009 moreover it may assist in the early prediction of potential wheat grain yield production helman et al 2018 as yields of dryland crops in semi arid are limited by precipitation an optimal crop management should take into account the rotation tillage and soil water content at the critical stages of the crop development bonfil et al 1999 therefore assessing end of season remaining water in the soil may be used for post season agricultural planning and management although using different δ t between 10 20 days resulted in an almost similar effect on modeled et an integration time of δ t 30 was too long and seemed to unaffected kcb and consequently et at the critical periods of water scarcity at both ends of the rainy season fig 5d e this is important because similar models have suggested the use of a δ t of 30 days to model et in grassland and cropland systems in more humid environments than those of our study site maselli et al 2014 this means that δ t should be specifically selected for different environments and likely for different soil types here we showed that a δ t of 30 days or longer result in ineffective constrain of the f rz on kcb failing in counterbalancing the positive effects of et0 and ndvi on modeled et during these important periods the integration time may be affected by numerous factors such as soil properties crop topography and atmospheric conditions thus a more thorough analysis should be conducted using different δ t periods in fields with diverse soil properties and atmospheric conditions to find what governs δ t and which δ t should be used in crop rs met for specific conditions this is particularly essential if crop rs met is planned to be used in spatially continuous assessment of et over vast crop areas accounting for soil type and properties is also important for accurate surface physics simulation of soil water dynamics shelia et al 2018 here we have taken the field area to be homogeneous in terms of soil properties and thus used a constant factor as a function of rain and irrigation for the estimation of deep percolation beyond the root zone depth pr however a physical simulation may be needed to account for changes in vertical and horizontal water movements within the soil layers particularly in fields with heterogeneous soil profiles it is also indispensable for use of crop rs met in a spatially continuous assessment of soil water content over large areas finally our crop rs met may be used to assess water status in crop fields with the use of ndvi acquired from high resolution satellite and unmanned aerial systems uas data manfreda et al 2018 until recently though trade off between the spatial and temporal resolutions of available images from satellites was a serious drawback helman 2018 this is particularly true for agricultural monitoring in household small size agricultural fields 0 2 ha which account for extensive areas in certain regions burke and lobell 2017 carletto et al 2015 a recent approach to overcome the spatio temporal limitation of satellite images is the use of nano satellites constellations i e using a large number of small compact sensors butler 2014 an example of such a company that uses the advantage of a large constellation of satellite systems is planet labs www planet com planet labs provide collections of 4 bands imageries at 3 5 m resolution on a daily basis from their nano satellite doves since the early 2016 s this information can be used to calculate ndvi that will in turn be used to replace the proximal ndvi in crop rs met using planet doves ndvi at these high spatial and temporal resolutions may provide a spatially continuous assessment of soil water dynamics in homogeneous crop fields assisting in crop monitoring and managements 6 conclusion a biophysical model of actual evapotranspiration and soil water content was adjusted for wheat crop crop rs met our crop rs met accurately estimated root zone soil water content in a variety of wheat cultivars more importantly it accurately simulated water available for the wheat at the critical heading stage however crop rs met has a simple representation of surface runoff and does not take into consideration heterogenous soil properties that may affect soil water dynamics thus efforts to combine numerical models that simulate soil water movement with crop rs met may be needed for a spatially continuous assessment of crop water use in heterogeneous fields with complex edaphic characteristics the crop rs met model presented here uses ndvi data from proximal sensing however it has the potential to be used with recently provided satellite ndvi at a high spatial and temporal resolution for spatially continuous soil water monitoring thereby enabling crop management strategies that will lead to improved water resource use efficiency finally being semi empirical our model should be further validated in other regions with different climatic conditions and edaphic characteristics

11299,assessing crops water use is essential for agricultural water management and planning particularly in water limited regions here we present a biophysical model to estimate crop actual evapotranspiration and root zone soil water content using proximal sensing and meteorological data crop rs met the model which is based on the dual fao56 formulation uses a water deficit factor calculated from rainfall and atmospheric demand information to constrain actual evapotranspiration and soil water content in crops growing under dry conditions we tested the crop rs met model in a dryland experimental field comprising a variety of wheat triticum aestivum l and t durum cultivars with diverse phenology crop rs met was shown to accurately capture seasonal changes in wheat water use during the growing season the average r2 of modeled vs observed soil water content for all cultivars n 11 was 0 92 0 02 with average relative rmse and bias of 9 29 1 30 and 0 13 0 03 respectively we found that changing the integration time period of the water deficit factor in crop rs met affects the accuracy of the model implying that this factor has a vital role in modeling crop water use under dry conditions currently crop rs met has a simple representation of surface runoff and does not take into consideration heterogeneity in the soil profile thus efforts to combine numerical models that simulate soil water dynamics with a crop rs met model driven by high resolution remote sensing data may be needed for a spatially continuous assessment of crop water use in fields with more complex edaphic characteristics keywords crop evapotranspiration et model ndvi proximal sensing soil water content swc wheat 1 introduction water scarcity is a primary limiting factor of crop yield production in dryland regions elliott et al 2014 frieler et al 2017 hoffman et al 2018 leng 2017 wilcox and makowski 2014 zhang et al 2017 estimating available water at the various growing stages of the crop may be therefore a critical issue for an adequate agricultural management in these regions this is primarily essential to improve both crop water use and yield production attia et al 2016 christy et al 2018 rajala et al 2009 an important component in the water budget and thus in calculating the remaining water available for the crop is the actual evapotranspiration et which is the water loss via direct surface evaporation and plant transpiration processes currently farmers use the empirical penman monteith formulation abdelhadi et al 2000 rawat et al 2017 or an alternative atmospheric demand reference et et0 formulation kashyap and panda 2001 for decision making on irrigation practices because estimating et is much more challenging however et0 which is based on the atmospheric demand cannot provide the actual water that is being lost from the field because this loss may be driven by numerous factors other than the atmospheric demand for example seasonal changes in crop water use may be highly constrained by soil moisture conditions and plant growth particularly under water limited conditions akuraju et al 2017 song et al 2018 also vapor pressure deficit has been shown to affect plant growth and stomatal conductance regulating the actual water use of the plant depending on the plant species and soil moisture conditions eamus et al 2008 sanginés de cárcer et al 2018 schoppach and sadok 2012 sinclair et al 2017 these factors which may be important to derive the actual crop water use are not taken directly into consideration when using crop et0 as a replacement to et even after adjusting the et0 with a crop coefficient an accurate et estimation is thus necessary to provide reliable information about the crop water use and crop water productivity i e the amount of biomass produced per unit of water used and the remaining soil water content available for the crop many approaches exist to assess et in crop fields see review in rana and katerji 2000 most of them though require intensive field based measurements and are suitable only for water status monitoring at the plot scale level e g liu et al 2002 lópez urrea et al 2009 to expand these plot based estimations to a wider area models integrating remote sensing rs satellite observations are often used e g helman et al 2017 2015a b and see also glenn et al 2010 for review of methods rs based et models range from simple empirical approaches to very complex models anderson et al 2008 bisquert et al 2016 campos et al 2016 colaizzi et al 2012 nagler et al 2013 su 2002 in between these models a biophysical model combining rs information on plant development and in situ meteorological data rs met was recently proposed for natural vegetation systems helman et al 2017 the rs met model is based on the fao56 formulation allen et al 1998 which uses plant and soil coefficients to describe the ratio of et to et0 throughout the growing season the accuracy of rs met was successfully demonstrated in several natural vegetation systems such as forests woodlands and shrublands by comparing modeled et with et derived using the eddy covariance technique helman et al 2017 in rs met the theoretical plant and soil coefficients of fao56 are replaced by linear functions of the satellite derived normalized difference vegetation index ndvi while ndvi is used as a proxy for plant growth leaf area and canopy developments helman et al 2015a b rs met provides daily et estimates at a spatial resolution of 250 m in natural vegetation water limited environments the satellite derived ndvi is used in rs met as a constraining factor on et when atmospheric demand is high but the canopy is not fully developed to support such a high atmospheric demand moreno et al 2014 a water deficit factor derived from rainfall and et0 was added in rs met to further constrain the modeled et in a case of water limitation the rationale behind using water deficit factors in rs met is based on studies showing that soil moisture conditions may have a strong influence on et in water limited environments akuraju et al 2017 helman et al 2017 maselli et al 2014 though promising rs met only estimates et and not soil water content which is important for irrigation management in crop fields also rs met was designed for natural vegetation systems and not for crops it currently lacks a proper representation of the influence of vapor pressure deficit on stomatal conductance and the interception component of et direct evaporation from the surface of leaves which is the rainwater fraction not reaching the ground these two factors may significantly affect et in crops kang et al 2005 li and rao 2000 in addition using daily satellite derived ndvi as input to the rs met model means degrading the spatial resolution of the model which may be problematic for crop monitoring of small size crop fields helman 2018 accounting for vast areas in some countries burke and lobell 2017 carletto et al 2015 proximal sensing using spectral sensors in the field may be a good solution to overcome the spatio temporal resolution problem lópez urrea et al 2009 proximal sensing has been recently used in precision agriculture to detect stressed areas marino et al 2015 matese et al 2018 assess the spatial variability in crop vigor marino and alvino 2014 aid in within season fertilizer management practices samborski et al 2009 evaluate plant water content mendiguren et al 2015 and improve in season predictions of crop quality and quantity magney et al 2016 it is also vastly used for crop phenotyping deery et al 2014 tattaris et al 2016 bonfil 2017 used a rapidscan sensor for in field phenotyping of a variety of wheat cultivars in israel showing that proximal sensing ndvi may be used to predict grain yield production assisting breeders with in field phenotyping here we aim to provide a simple semi empirical model based on the original rs met with some adjustments for crop fields which may be easily used by farmers for irrigation management purposes we use proximal sensing ndvi in the adjusted version of rs met hereafter crop rs met for the assessment of et and root zone soil water content in an experimental wheat field crop rs met includes a vapor pressure deficit factor and the interception component of et in addition to the water deficit factor already used in the original rs met model we test our crop rs met in a variety of spring wheat 10 triticum aestivum l and one t durum cultivars comprising diverse phenology and compare it with in situ root zone soil water content measurements along the growing season we further examine the effects of vapor pressure deficit and water deficit factors on modeled et in crop rs met 2 data and methods 2 1 experimental field design and wheat cultivars the experimental field is located at the gilat research center of the agricultural research organization southern israel 31 21 n 34 42 e a total of 11 wheat 10 triticum aestivum l and one t durum cultivar varieties with five replicates for each cultivar was tested the experiment included all leading israeli cultivars representing a wide variation in phenology bonfil 2017 each plot replication having an average size of 5 m 2 m was sown to ensure a stand of about 200 plants m 2 in addition to rainfall plots were irrigated before and particularly after the beginning of the heading stage heading occurred between 74 and 88 days after emergence 23 february and 9 march 2014 depending on the wheat cultivar 2 2 soil moisture measurements the soil in gilat experimental field is loess with four layers sandy loam at depths of 0 25 cm sandy loam to loam at 25 55 cm loam at 55 77 cm and loam to clay loam at 77 100 cm the bulk densities of these layers are 1 45 g cm 1 for the top 25 cm 1 30 g cm 1 for the 25 55 cm layer 1 75 g cm 1 for the 55 77 cm layer and 1 80 g cm 1 for the 77 100 cm deep layer electrical conductivity ec ranges from 0 043 s m 1 at the top 25 cm to 0 64 s m 1 at 100 cm depth while carbonate nodules range from 10 g kg 1 at the top 25 cm to 300 g kg 1 at the deep 77 100 cm layer the maximum wetting front depth at gilat typically ranges from approximately 30 cm in dry years to 1 m in wet years amir et al 1991 therefore volumetric soil moisture was measured at intervals of 10 cm to a depth of 1 m in each 5 m 2 m plot using a portable dielectric probe system pr2 profile probe dynamax inc soil water content was also determined gravimetrically in each 5 m 2 m plot using the drying method w w samples 100 g of dry soil were taken at 10 cm increments to a depth of 1 m at the pr2 profile probe intervals a week after emergence and after harvest using a hydraulic auger in order to overcome errors due to a changing distance between the tube and the soil we sampled the soil near the tube 10 cm from the tube several times along the season soil samples were used to calibrate the probe data after normalizing the data using the minimum and maximum obtained values linearly information on the available water from rain and irrigation was used to further constrain the range of the probe data together with estimations from the gravimetric method available soil water was between 7 5 0 03 mpa and up to approximately 15 1 5 mpa finally soil moisture measurements were integrated to represent an average root zone depth of 1 m which is the average root depth of israeli wheat cultivars bonfil et al 1999 soil characteristics were homogeneous across the experimental field thus the 1 m swc was averaged per cultivar over the five plots prior to comparing with modeled swc 2 3 proximal ndvi using rapidscan sensor proximal sensing was conducted in the field using a rapidscan cs 45 sensor holland scientific inc the rapidscan sensor measures crop soil reflectances at three spectral bands 670 nm 730 nm and 780 nm in red red egde and near infrared respectively spectral measurements from rapidscan were recorded by scanning each plot every week at an approximated height of 1 m above the canopy fig 1 where the sensor field of view is approximately 30 14 this height of 1 m was proved to be the best height for spectral measurements according to kipp et al 2014 and following a previous study conducted in this site bonfil 2017 following this information the measured area in each sub plot may be calculated as the plot length multiplied by 0 5 m c 6 m2 in most cases reflectance data were collected throughot the entire growing season from emergence to harvest ndvi was calculated for each plot as ndvi r780 r670 r780 r670 rouse et al 1973 and avereged over the five replicates for each cultivar the weekly ndvi was linearly interpolated to derive daily values important phenological stages like heading and grain filling dates were assessed in the field 2 4 meteorology daily meteorological data were collected from the gilat meteorological station which is located only 5 m from the experiment field provided by the israeli ministry of agriculture http www meteo moag gov il meteorological information included daily summed radiation load mj d 1 daily mean temperature at a standard 2 m height c daily mean relative humidity rh and daily sums of precipitation mm d 1 the vapor pressure deficit vpd was calculated from the saturated vapor pressure for a given temperature following murray et al 1966 and for a given rh the average daily temperature for the growing season was 18 23 c with a maximum and minimum of 24 93 c and 11 52 c respectively mean daily rh was 60 66 with maximum and minimum rh values of 88 44 and 32 87 respectively the water supply from rainfall was 282 10 mm and from irrigation 171 15 mm total of 453 25 mm fig 2 shows meteorological forcing and rapidscan ndvi for bar nir cultivar at the experimental field 3 crop rs met model we adjusted the rs met remote sensing and meteorological et model helman et al 2017 to derive actual et and soil water content swc on a daily basis in fields cultivated with a variety of wheat cultivars 3 1 modeling actual evapotranspiration in crop rs met the original rs met et model is based on the dual crop soil fao56 formulation allen et al 2006 1998 1 et et0 kcb ke where kcb and ke are the basal crop coefficient and the soil evaporation coefficient respectively that represent the ratio of et to et0 which changes along the season due to canopy development and changing soil moisture conditions lu et al 2011 vivoni et al 2008 note that et in eq 1 is actually the standard crop et which becomes the actual crop et once adjusted for water stress conditions the dynamical behavior of these coefficients is represented in rs met by a function of soil moisture conditions f sm and satellite derived ndvi f ndvi the latter is used as a proxy of leaf area index lai f sm is derived using local meteorological information the f sm and f ndvi are used to adjust maximum kcb and ke values taken from a lookup table for the specific plant functional type and soil conditions kcbmax and kemax respectively thus eq 1 in the rs met model becomes 2 et et0 f ndvi f sm kcbmax kemax a linear transformation of ndvi is used in the original rs met model to derive fractional vegetation cover here we used proximal ndvi instead of satellite derived ndvi in a similar linear function we used this linear transformation as a proxy for fractional lai i e flai f ndvi with the daily ndvi derived from proximal sensing in the wheat field 3 flai ndvi ndvisoil ndviveg ndvisoil where ndvisoil and ndviveg are constant values representing ndvi values of bare soil and a fully developed canopy ndvisoil 0 1 and ndviveg 0 85 respectively which were derived from the in field measurements before seeding and at the time when the wheat canopy was fully developed eq 3 is thus defined as the fractional lai representing canopy development and may be used to adjust kcbmax in eq 2 to adjust kemax the complement of flai is used thus eq 2 may be rewritten as follows 4 et et0 f sm flai kcbmax 1 flai kemax next a water deficit factor for root zone f rz and surface f su soil moisture are used to further adjust kcbmax and kemax accounting for the available water for plant transpiration and soil surface evaporation respectively f su is first calculated as the simple ratio of daily water supply ws which is the amount of rainfall p and irrigation irr to daily et0

δ t e t 0 basically δ t may vary for different crop types and environmental conditions here we used δ t of 15 days but also tested different δ ts 10 20 30 and 45 days to explore the effect of δ t on kc and subsequently on the modeled et and swc f rz is then calculated as a linear function of f su while it is set to vary between 0 5 and 1 6 f rz 0 5 0 5 f su eq 6 means that et may be reduced to no more than half the potential maximum in the absence of water supply simulating basic transpiration levels maintained by crop plants glenn et al 2011 the assumption is that plant tissues are damaged at lower transpiration levels than half the maximum this damage will be then detected through a significant reduction in ndvi and flai which will in turn reduce the modeled et see eq 4 accounting for f su and f rz eq 4 becomes 7 et et0 f rz flai kcbmax f su 1 flai kemax two new additions not present in the original rs met model were included here in crop rs met i a vapor pressure deficit vpd factor fvpd was used to account for vpd effect on stomatal conductance vpd has been shown to be an important parameter affecting stomatal opening and thus a limiting factor for plant transpiration which may be counterbalanced by water availability oren et al 1999 schoppach and sadok 2012 ii interception component of et iet iet is calculated as a function of leaf development i e lai accounting for the direct evaporation from the surface of leaves i e the fraction of p not reaching the ground for i we used the logarithmic function of stomatal conductance response to vpd proposed by oren et al 1999 8 fvpd 1 m ln vpd where m denotes the sensitivity of stomatal conductance to vpd as the natural logarithm per kilopascal m was found to be 0 60 ln kpa for wheat hoshika et al 2017 while a similar value was also previously proposed for other plant functional types oren et al 1999 fvpd is then used in crop rs met to constrain kcbmax through a jarvis type model damour et al 2010 jarvis 1976 in the form 9 et et0 max fvpd f rz flai kcbmax f su 1 flai kemax where the maximum between fvpd and f rz is used to constrains kcbmax instead of a multiplicative function i e fvpd f rz to better represent the tradeoff between water availability and atmospheric control on stomatal conductance hoshika et al 2017 for ii the iet component is calculated as a multiplicative function of p in mm d 1 and flai as follows 10 iet imax p flai where imax is defined as the maximum fraction of p evaporated directly from the surface of a fully developed wheat canopy we used an imax value of 0 25 25 of the p in crop rs met following results from several observational studies on wheat kang et al 2005 li and rao 2000 including eqs 8 10 and integrating all et components in the model et from crop rs met becomes 11 et et0 max fvpd f rz flai kcbmax f su 1 flai kemax iet finally we used a kcbmax value of 1 2 for wheat development allen et al 1998 and a low 0 2 value for kemax following helman et al 2017 and maselli et al 2014 to derive daily estimates of et from eq 11 for each plot and cultivar 3 2 root zone soil water content crop root zone depth is dynamic and changes along the growing season usually until the flowering stage after which it stabilizes swc is simulated in crop rs met as the amount of available water to the roots at a changing root zone depth this is because et in crop rs met does not depend on root depth but is estimated empirically from ndvi as a proxy of leaf expansion and meteorological conditions yet we used swc measurements from the upper 1 m soil layer to validate our model assuming that this was the typical root zone depth along the season the root zone swc in crop rs met was calculated as the accumulated ws minus the daily et the ws was summed throughout the seasonal year accounting for a 5 reduction pr 0 05 ws due to water that seeps underneath the root zone i e 1 m through percolation process note that pr also includes surface runoff in eq 12 which was assumed to be neglectable in our study site 12 s w c t i 0 t w s e t p r 3 3 model uncertainty the main driver of et in crop rs met is et0 eq 11 hence an accurate assessment of et0 is crucial for a correct modeling of et here we calculated et0 using three different methods i the penman monteith pm formulation allen et al 1998 13 e t 0 p m 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t a 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 the pm is considered a standard et0 method and is vastly used worldwide the rn in eq 13 is the net radiation mj m 2 d 1 g is soil heat flux density mj m 2 d 1 ta is the mean daily air temperature c u2 is wind speed at 2 m height m s 1 es and ea are saturation and actual vapor pressures kpa respectively and es ea is the vapor pressure deficit δ is the slope vapor pressure curve kpa c 1 γ is the psychrometric constant kpa c 1 et0 pm was derived in mm d 1 because pm requires many parameters to compute et0 droogers and allen 2002 which are not always available we used also a more simple empirical method to compute et0 ii the jensen and haise 1963 empirical equation jh 14 e t 0 j h r n 2470 0 078 0 0252 t a where ta is the mean daily air temperature c rg is daily global total incoming solar radiation kj m 2 d 1 et0 jh is finally converted into mm d 1 by dividing rg by 2470 mm kj m 2 d 1 eq 13 and jensen and haise 1963 the advantage of the jh method over pm is that it only requires temperature and solar radiation data which may be easily acquired from conventional weather stations and or satellite data iii finally we used pan evaporation to calculate et0 by measuring surface evaporation from evaporation pan epan which was further adjusted to et0 pan with the use of a pan coefficient kp eagleman 1967 15 et0 pan kp epan an average kp value of 0 7 was used throughout the season following recommendations of the israeli meteorological service for gilat to obtain the model uncertainty we averaged the et0 estimated using the three methods eqs 13 15 the model s error was defined as the maximum and minimum et and swc obtained from using the three et0 estimates in eq 11 4 results 4 1 modeling actual evapotranspiration et changed along the season between 0 mm d 1 prior to wheat appearance and up to 7 mm d 1 at the heading stage in all cultivars fig 3 shows an example of daily et derived from crop rs met for a single wheat cultivar bar nir the dominant et component at the start of the growing season from mid to end of december days 70 90 in fig 3 and prior to wheat emergence flai is attributed to soil evaporation it was mostly synchronized with the first rains fig 2 and a slight increase in et0 following a significant gradual increase in et driven by et0 and flai is noted an abrupt decrease in et was then observed towards the end of march around day 180 in fig 3 with a more gradual decrease followed until the end of the growing season day 220 in fig 3 this last gradual decrease in et was despite of a relatively high flai at least until mid april and a significant increase in et0 it followed a long dry period which resulted in significant kcb and consequently et reductions see following fig 5b soil evaporation was significant again but still lower compared to the et at the main growing season at the end of the growing season due to late rains in may compare with fig 2 a sensitivity of flai to et0 was noted at the peak of the growing season as flai decreased by c 0 1 units from day 150 to 163 in fig 3 synchronized with a et0 reduction an abrupt decrease in ndvi and thus in flai during the peak of the growing season was likely due to a lower photosynthetic activity during these days which were cloudy as implied from the low solar radiation load and recorded rainfall mid march rains in fig 2 photosynthetic activity was low due to energy limitation 4 2 soil water content average seasonal changes in swc were between 0 mm3 mm 3 prior to appearance and 2 5 mm3 mm 3 at c 70 days after appearance fig 4 shows the seasonal evolution and baseline comparison of measured vs modeled swc at the top 1 m in the same plot of cultivar bar nir fig 3 the model shows to capture well changes in swc following dry periods rainfall and irrigation it also shows to follow the gradual decrease in observed swc at the end of the growing season the r2 rmse and bias of modeled vs observed swc by cultivars are shown in table 1 the r2 was in the 0 89 0 95 range with an average score of 0 92 0 02 the average relative rmse and bias were low with average scores of 9 29 1 30 and 0 13 0 03 respectively 4 3 changing the water deficit accumulation period in the model changing the accumulation period δ t significantly affected the water deficit factor i e f rz and consequently the kcb kcb refers here to kcb max fvpd f rz flai kcbmax as shown in fig 5 for the same bn cultivar for example by using δ t of 10 and 15 days the f rz was reduced to a minimum c 0 5 at the beginning of the critical heading stage days 129 144 in fig 5a b thus consequently reducing the kcb this kcb reduction resulted in lower modeled et values compare with fig 3 and a more restrained swc decrease which was in accordance to the gradual decrease in observed swc during this period of time see fig 4 using δ t of 20 days shortened the period of the kcb reduction due to the more restrained decrease in the f rz fig 5c while δ t of 30 and 45 days hardly reduced the kcb during this period fig 5d e the f vpd was almost insignificant in regulating the kcb during the entire growing period fig 5 however at the start of the heading stage the f vpd was significant counterbalancing the negative effect that f rz had on kcb fig 5a b this positive effect at the start of the heading stage though was only meaningful for model simulations with δ t of 10 and 15 days but not for model simulations with longer δ t periods fig 5 another effect of δ t was observed at the senescence period during the senescence period kcb was a crucial factor in reducing modeled et that would have been increased without the kcb constraint due to the high flai and increased et0 at this time of the year figs 3 and 5 kcb and consequently the et reductions resulted in a more than expected gradual decrease of modeled swc which was also in accordance with the gradual decrease observed in measured swc at the end of the growing season fig 4 comparing the model performance with the different δ t periods shows that using a δ t of 15 days achieves the best results followed by δ t of 10 and 20 days fig 6 using a δ t of 45 days resulted in a far lower but still highly significant model performance table 2 summarizes the average r2 rmse and bias scores over all cultivars of modeled vs measured swc estimates when using the model with different δ t periods 4 4 end of season soil water content from crop rs met sensors and gravimetric method end of season swc may assist in post season agricultural planning thus we compare our modeled swc with measured swc at the end of the growth season end of season swc was comparable for all cultivars with no significant difference between crop rs met estimates using δ t 15 days and in situ sensor measurements p 0 05 table 3 end of season gravimetric swc estimates were slightly but significantly lower than sensors swc p 0 05 but non significantly lower than crop rs met swc p 0 05 which was within the estimates from the two field based methods table 3 mean end of season swc for all cultivars was quite similar from all methods with 117 18 mm m 3 from crop rs met 121 16 mm m 3 from sensor measurements and 112 9 mm m 3 using the gravimetric method table 3 5 discussion the high accuracy of the crop rs met in assessing root zone swc has been demonstrated in this study in a variety of wheat cultivars the advantage of the crop rs met model is its simplicity and the use of a relatively few parameters that may be easily acquired crop rs met may be used to simulate water constrains on crop growth in process based models bassu et al 2014 jin et al 2016 rosenzweig et al 2014 wang et al 2017 soil water dynamics is an important factor affecting photosynthetic activity and currently many process based models suffer from a poor representation of water dynamics in the soil profile the lack of a proper surface physics simulation such as soil water dynamics may result in model uncertainties particularly in crops growing under water limited conditions rajala et al 2009 crop rs met may provide a simple simulation of surface water dynamics essential for such models e g shelia et al 2018 yin et al 2015 where runoff is insignificant or null as in the case of our study site moreover crop rs met may be easily combined with a simple mechanistic soil water flow model to provide available water at the root zone in fields where runoff is a significant component of the water balance estimating soil water content at the soil profile during critical periods such as wheat heading anthesis and grain filling stages may provide an early prediction of yield production being very important for decision making bonfil et al 2004 helman et al 2018 showed that root zone soil water content at heading is a good estimator of potential end of season wheat grain yield production thus knowing the available water during heading may assist in decision making regarding whether to harvest at an early stage for hay or silage with a lower income or to leave the crop for yield production with the risk of a major economic loss since the test weight is expected to decline from that stage moreover information on soil water content can help in forecasting the need for late nitrogen application that will ensure required protein levels in the wheat bonfil et al 2004 the use of a factor that account for water deficit conditions f su and f rz with a proper integration time period δ t was shown here to be significant in constraining the effects of plant phenology represented by ndvi and atmospheric demand seasonal et0 on et this was particularly essential at both ends of the rainy season adjusting the modeled et to water deficit conditions at the root zone during these periods similar results were obtained in natural water limited environments using the rs met model helman et al 2017 here the role of the water deficit factors was even more noteworthy because it constrained et at the beginning of the rainy season which coincided with the wheat s heading stage constraining modeled et at the heading stage is pivotal because it allows an accurate estimation of soil water content at the root zone during this crucial period this may be essential for a proper irrigation management attia et al 2016 christy et al 2018 and improvement of wheat s grain yield production lópez urrea et al 2009 moreover it may assist in the early prediction of potential wheat grain yield production helman et al 2018 as yields of dryland crops in semi arid are limited by precipitation an optimal crop management should take into account the rotation tillage and soil water content at the critical stages of the crop development bonfil et al 1999 therefore assessing end of season remaining water in the soil may be used for post season agricultural planning and management although using different δ t between 10 20 days resulted in an almost similar effect on modeled et an integration time of δ t 30 was too long and seemed to unaffected kcb and consequently et at the critical periods of water scarcity at both ends of the rainy season fig 5d e this is important because similar models have suggested the use of a δ t of 30 days to model et in grassland and cropland systems in more humid environments than those of our study site maselli et al 2014 this means that δ t should be specifically selected for different environments and likely for different soil types here we showed that a δ t of 30 days or longer result in ineffective constrain of the f rz on kcb failing in counterbalancing the positive effects of et0 and ndvi on modeled et during these important periods the integration time may be affected by numerous factors such as soil properties crop topography and atmospheric conditions thus a more thorough analysis should be conducted using different δ t periods in fields with diverse soil properties and atmospheric conditions to find what governs δ t and which δ t should be used in crop rs met for specific conditions this is particularly essential if crop rs met is planned to be used in spatially continuous assessment of et over vast crop areas accounting for soil type and properties is also important for accurate surface physics simulation of soil water dynamics shelia et al 2018 here we have taken the field area to be homogeneous in terms of soil properties and thus used a constant factor as a function of rain and irrigation for the estimation of deep percolation beyond the root zone depth pr however a physical simulation may be needed to account for changes in vertical and horizontal water movements within the soil layers particularly in fields with heterogeneous soil profiles it is also indispensable for use of crop rs met in a spatially continuous assessment of soil water content over large areas finally our crop rs met may be used to assess water status in crop fields with the use of ndvi acquired from high resolution satellite and unmanned aerial systems uas data manfreda et al 2018 until recently though trade off between the spatial and temporal resolutions of available images from satellites was a serious drawback helman 2018 this is particularly true for agricultural monitoring in household small size agricultural fields 0 2 ha which account for extensive areas in certain regions burke and lobell 2017 carletto et al 2015 a recent approach to overcome the spatio temporal limitation of satellite images is the use of nano satellites constellations i e using a large number of small compact sensors butler 2014 an example of such a company that uses the advantage of a large constellation of satellite systems is planet labs www planet com planet labs provide collections of 4 bands imageries at 3 5 m resolution on a daily basis from their nano satellite doves since the early 2016 s this information can be used to calculate ndvi that will in turn be used to replace the proximal ndvi in crop rs met using planet doves ndvi at these high spatial and temporal resolutions may provide a spatially continuous assessment of soil water dynamics in homogeneous crop fields assisting in crop monitoring and managements 6 conclusion a biophysical model of actual evapotranspiration and soil water content was adjusted for wheat crop crop rs met our crop rs met accurately estimated root zone soil water content in a variety of wheat cultivars more importantly it accurately simulated water available for the wheat at the critical heading stage however crop rs met has a simple representation of surface runoff and does not take into consideration heterogenous soil properties that may affect soil water dynamics thus efforts to combine numerical models that simulate soil water movement with crop rs met may be needed for a spatially continuous assessment of crop water use in heterogeneous fields with complex edaphic characteristics the crop rs met model presented here uses ndvi data from proximal sensing however it has the potential to be used with recently provided satellite ndvi at a high spatial and temporal resolution for spatially continuous soil water monitoring thereby enabling crop management strategies that will lead to improved water resource use efficiency finally being semi empirical our model should be further validated in other regions with different climatic conditions and edaphic characteristics
