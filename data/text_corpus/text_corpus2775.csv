13875,the excess phosphate and tetracycline tc in natural environments potentially threatens ecosystem few studies were conducted on efficient and cost effective method for dealing with these pollutants together we attempted to reutilize this abandoned calcite for the removal of other pollutant in wastewater such as tetracycline firstly removal of high concentration phosphate by calcite was studied in batch experiments thereafter removal of tc by this used calcite p loaded calcite was investigated under different conditions ph phosphate concentration dried state and humid state using calcite for high concentration phosphate removal the results showed that 1 concentrations of phosphate higher than 30 mg l 1 resulted in a significant phosphate precipitation on calcite surface at both ph7 7 and ph 8 3 within 24 h the corresponding ph and calcium results confirmed this precipitation occurrence 2 the precipitated phase was supposed to be amorphous calcium phosphate through the results of ir xps xrd and bet analysis compared to that by pure calcite the tc removal rate by p loaded calcite increased significantly with the initial phosphate concentration in both cases of humid experiment and dried experiment this may be attributed to the adsorption of tc on the precipitated amorphous calcium phosphate which has a larger specific surface and increasingly generates ca sites from the similarity of tc removal rate by p loaded calcite between ph7 7 and ph 8 3 it is hypothesized that tc removal is due to tch2 and tch adsorption on ca sites the minor difference of tc removal rate by p loaded calcites between humid experiment and dried experiment is mainly due to slight dissolution of precipitated amorphous calcium phosphate our research will serve as reference knowledge for the reutilization of abandoned calcite in phosphate removal which provides a new way to reduce the wasted materials and environmental risks induced by tetracycline keywords tetracycline calcite phosphate adsorption precipitation 1 introduction phosphate po4 3 is recognized as one of the key elements that impair the aquatic environmental quality since excess of phosphorous p supply can cause eutrophication to water body 1 4 phosphorus recovery from wastewater has been of great importance calcite caco3 is a common mineral in the hydrosphere and lithosphere 5 and has the potential to retain po4 3 thereby reducing its mobility considering the importance of calcite in p control the interaction between po4 3 and calcite surface has been widely studied 6 14 through these studies it can be found that at low concentration phosphate was retained on calcite by surface adsorption mechanism in this case the used calcite could be utilized as fertilizer in the acid soil on the other hand at high concentration phosphate was mainly removed by surface precipitation in the form of calcium phosphate this used calcite could be recycled for the phosphate removal and even this type of used calcite could be more efficient than the original calcite because newly formed calcium phosphate crystals have covered their surfaces 10 however based on these reports it can be observed that the used calcite could be reused simply in the domain concerning phosphate apparently there are few studies concerning the application of these used calcites phosphate loaded calcites on the removal of other pollutant especially after high concentration phosphate removal in fact after high concentration phosphate removal by calcite the calcite surface could be covered by the precipitation of calcium phosphate this seems to be a type of modification of calcite surface 15 is it possible that the used calcite could be utilized for removing other pollutant after high concentration phosphate removal with these purposes in the present study we try to utilize this type of used calcite for tetracycline tc removal the reasons are as follows 1 as is mentioned previously the phosphate at high concentration could be precipitated on calcite surface by forming a mixture of the apatite family 16 11 8 such as dicalcium phosphate dihydrate dcpd octacalcium phosphate ocp and amorphous calcium phosphate acp which could be existing for a certain period of time 13 17 and finally transited to the most stable phase of hydroxyapatite hap 2 according to the study 18 tc can easily bind with calcium phosphate nano particles in addition the apatite family can be utilized in tc delivery since tc is well known to have a good affinity with calcium phosphate 18 19 3 the abundance of tetracycline tc in natural environments potentially threatens ecosystem functions tc removal is also the focus of many studies recently adsorption of tc on clay minerals were frequently reported such as kaolinite 20 rectorite 21 smectite 22 montmorillonite 23 24 goethite 25 however few studies have been carried out for the removal of tc by carbonate mineral considered as natural material calcite is one of the most abundant carbonate minerals in the earth s lithosphere and biosphere 26 27 in our previous study 28 it was discovered that the pure calcite has a certain removal capacity for tc it is interesting to see whether there is any improvement of tc removal by this used calcite phosphate loaded calcite after removing high concentrated phosphate compared to the pure calcite in order to achieve our goal the following procedure will be followed as 1 firstly we should try to understand the modifications of calcite surface and the aqueous chemistry change in solution after removal of high concentration phosphate 2 thereafter we will try to observe how much more tetracycline can be retained on the surface of used calcite phosphate loaded calcite compared to the pure calcite we believe that our research will serve as reference knowledge for the reutilization of abandoned calcite in phosphate removal which provides a new way to reduce the wasted materials and environmental risks induced by tetracycline 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials potassium dihydrogen phosphate 99 5 purity was sourced from shanghai ling feng chemical reagent co ltd tetracycline hydrochloride usp grade was purchased from aladdin industrial corporation the mother solutions of these chemicals were prepared using milliq water calcite 99 purity used in this study was supplied by xirong chemistry company china 2 2 choice of ph and production of pre equilibrated water high concentrated phosphate can easily precipitate on calcite at ph of 8 3 according to the previous study 13 moreover results from another study 28 revealed that tc could be adsorbed significantly at ph levels between 7 7 and 8 7 taking these facts into account the experimental ph chosen were ph7 7 and ph 8 3 for the removal of phosphate and tetracycline in current study as the concentration of dissolved carbon dioxide is known to have strong effects on the surface chemistry of calcite and its solubility 29 30 the experiment with calcite in present study was studied under calco carbonic equilibrium conditions i e atmospheric co2 calcite phase and the solution species are at quasi thermodynamic equilibrium additionally calco carbonic equilibrium conditions were considered as a good condition for appropriate characterization of the surface reaction of calcite 31 as shown in fig s1 equilibrium water eqw was produced by the following steps 1 10 g of calcite was put into 8 l of ultrapure water reservoir 2 using visual minteq 3 1 32 quantitative hydrochloric acid hcl or sodium hydroxide naoh was added into the reservoir to adjust the ph 3 water reservoir was aerated continuously by bubbling filter and humidified air through the water at constant ambient atmospheric pressure until the equilibrium was achieved after equilibrium eqw was obtained by filtration via 0 45 Î¼m cellulose acetate filter the experimental and theoretical values of ph ionic strength and aqueous calcium of eqw are listed in table s1 as well as the details of acid or base additions 2 3 experiment of high concentration phosphate removal and tc removal typically 2 g of calcite was put into a 250 ml tube containing 40 ml eqw to ensure the caco3 co2 h2o equilibrium at a constant ph 7 7 and 8 3 the tube was covered by parafilm with tiny punctures subsequently put in thermostatic oscillator 150 rpm at 25 c for 24 h 33 finally ph was measured to confirm the caco3 co2 h2o equilibrium in our previous work 13 it was found that under calco carbonic equilibrium condition at ph 8 3 phosphate precipitations are significantly increased by initial po4 3 concentration at 10 mg l 1 after 24 h of reaction time similarly griffin and jurinak 14 reported that the higher the initial concentration the faster the precipitation of phosphate in the present study we used po4 3 at different concentrations of 30 50 75 and 100 mg l 1 to ensure phosphate precipitation on calcite the tubes were placed in a thermostatic oscillator and shaken for 24 h all the experiments were replicated 6 times to examine the effect of phosphate on removal of tc by calcite the aforementioned six 6 sample tubes were divided into two parts 2 sample tubes for part 1 and 4 for part 2 part 1 two 2 sample tubes were chosen for experiments of tc removal the experiment was carried out as follows aliquots of tetracycline were put into the tubes with varying concentrations 5 15 and 30 mg l 1 the tubes were then covered by parafilm with tiny punctures and shaken again in a thermostatic oscillator based on several trials 2 h was chosen as the equilibration time for present study of tc removal as found in our previous study 28 after 2 h of equilibration time the experimental ph was measured and the solution was centrifuged for 5 min at 4000 rpm the supernatant solution was immediately displaced for analysis of calcium concentration phosphate concentration and tetracycline concentration we designated this type of experiment as humid experiment part 2 the remaining four 4 sample tubes were then centrifuged for 5 min at 4000 rpm after centrifugation the supernatant was almost completely poured out and then analyzed for the ph calcium concentration and phosphate concentration the residual calcite in tubes was washed slightly by water and then placed in an oven at 30 for 12 h of drying two 2 of these 4 dried calcite samples were kept for bet x ray diffraction xrd ir and xps analysis the remaining 2 dried calcite samples were then put in 250 ml tubes with 40 ml of eqw for experiments of tc removal thereafter experimentation for tc removal in part 2 was carried out in the same manner as that in part 1 we designated this experiment of tc removal in part 2 as dried experiment meanwhile several tubes containing pure calcite were prepared for tc removal experiment for comparison with the aforementioned experiment we designated this experiment of tc removal by pure calcite as blank experiment in addition the kinetic and isotherm study of tc adsorption on p loaded calcite were also conducted the corresponding procedure was similar to that previously stated in humid experiment and dried experiment in kinetic study the initial tc concentration of 5 mg l 1 was used and the reaction time was set to 0 25 0 5 1 2 4 8 and 12 h respectively in isotherm study the initial tc concentrations of 5 100 mg l 1 were employed 2 4 test for release of retained phosphate from calcite this additional experiment was carried out to find out the possibility of a release of the retained phosphate on calcite after the interaction between phosphate and calcite as described in section 2 3 the tube containing calcite was centrifuged the supernatant denoted supernatant 1 was almost completely poured out for analysis of phosphate concentration as c1 and the total weight of the humid solid calcite was measured as m1 then the tube was heated in an oven at a temperature of 30 c for 12 h after being dried the mass of the dried calcite was denoted as m2 thereafter 40 ml of corresponding eqw was poured into the tube and the tube was put into the shaker for 12 h subsequently the tube containing calcite was centrifuged and the final supernatant was denoted as supernatant 2 which was analyzed for phosphate concentration c2 the mass of released phosphate could be calculated by the following formula 40 1000 c2 m1 m2 1000 c1 all these outlined experimental procedures were repeated twice 2 5 analytical method the concentration of po4 3 was analyzed spectrophotometrically using the ammonium molybdate blue method according to ds en iso 6878 2004 34 the amount of po4 3 removal was calculated as the differences between the initial and final aqueous concentration the calcium concentration was analyzed by atomic absorption spectroscopy agilent 3150 g calibration for calcium analysis was made with 5 standards between 0 5 and 2 5 mg l 1 with r2 not less than 0 99 the limit of detection for calcium analysis was 0 2 mg l 1 the ph was measured by ph meter phsj 4 f shanghai inesa before and after the interaction with phosphate the calcite was characterized as follows the powder x ray diffraction patterns xrd of calcite were recorded on bruker axs d8 advance model powder diffractometer the bet surface area of calcite was determined by n2 multipoint gas adsorption autosorb 1 c quantachrome usa spectroscopic studies in the infrared ir regions 4000 400 cm 1 were carried out using fourier transform spectrometer digilab fts 60mvpc bio rad standard transmission technique was used spectra were collected after 256 scans at 4 cm 1 resolution the xps analysis was performed by the spectrometer escalab 250 with mg ka irradiation as x ray source tetracycline hydrochloride was utilized as a single type of tetracyclines in present study the tc concentrations were determined by high performance liquid chromatography hplc the mobile phase consisted of ultrapure water a and methanol b the gradient system was conducted as follows 0 3 min 10 b 3 10 min 10 75 b 10 13 min 75 75 b 13 15 min 75 10 b 15 17 min 10 10 b the ï¬ow rate of mobile phase was 1 ml min from the beginning until 17 min 50 Î¼l of the sample was injected into the instrument the detection wavelength was set at 357 nm referring to the study on removal of tetracycline hydrochloride 35 as experimental ph is a bit alkaline and tc is supposed to decompose easily in basic condition it is necessary to confirm the accuracy of interpretation of tc removal by hplc method for this justification 4 samples were prepared one sample as standard was the 15 mg l 1 of tc in eqw the other 3 samples were the samples for the 15 mg l 1 of tc removal in corresponding experiments blank experiment humid experiment and dried experiment the analytical results by hplc for these samples were presented in fig s2 fig s2 indicated that there is always just one characteristic peak present at the same position of about 10 min for these 4 samples the peak height for sample with calcite exhibited an obvious chute compared to that without calcite hence it is suggested that tc is possibly removed by its reaction with calcite rather than its own decomposition also as some other non negligible ions such as ca2 po4 3 were present in tc solution additional experiment was conducted to verify if there is precipitation of tc with ca2 and if there is interference of other ions for tc analysis with hplc additional experiment calibration for tc analysis was made with 6 standards between 0 and 30 mg l 1 for doing 3 types of calibration we chose 3 different matrixes for preparing the standards of tc such as milliq water cacl2 solution 0 1 mol l 1 for ca2 concentration much more important than that in present study and potassium phosphate solution 10 mg l 1 for p concentration much higher than that in our final sample solution prior to the analysis these standards were also shaken in thermostatic oscillator as same as for the samples the results in fig s3 demonstrate that these 3 calibration lines are almost the same with r2 exceeding 0 99 it therefore suggested that there is no interference of other ions such as phosphate for the tc analysis and also there is no occurrence of precipitation of tc with ca2 in the present study visual minteq 3 1 was deployed to calculate equilibrium speciation in the solution using the default equilibrium constants in its database 32 36 the equilibrium constants concerning the system phosphate calcite co2 h2o are listed in table s2 langumuir and freundlich functions were employed for describing the isotherm curve they are presented as follows 1 l a n g m u i r q e q m k l c e 1 k l c e ce the tc equilibrium

mg1 n ln g 1 n the linear coefficients 3 results and discussions 3 1 phosphate removal by calcite 3 1 1 phosphate removal at ph7 7 system as shown in fig 1 a the po4 3 removal rate did not decrease with initial p concentration from 30 to 100 mg l 1 it rather increased slowly and gradually approached 100 ordinarily if po4 3 removal is mainly by surface adsorption the po4 3 removal rate appears to decrease with increasing initial po4 3 concentration 14 however our results contradict with the adsorption assumption and this may be due to the fact that po4 3 removal is mainly by precipitation on calcite surface a similar experimental work 37 observed that with initial p concentration of 3 mg l 1 at ph of 7 5 more than 60 of po4 3 removal is attributed to po4 3 precipitation on calcite after 24 h reaction time in our recent work 13 after 24 h reaction time in a ph7 7 system the po4 3 removal percentage was about 95 with initial p concentration of 10 mg l 1 where surface precipitation of po4 3 was the main removal mechanism additionally griffin and jurinak 14 suggested that the higher the initial concentration the faster the precipitation of phosphate on calcite surface based on these findings we proposed that a large portion of po4 3 at concentration of 30 mg l 1 can significantly precipitate on calcite surface within 24 h reaction time in present study the corresponding calcium concentration fig 1b was found to be around 400 mg l 1 and exhibited a small decrease with initial p concentration 30 mg l 1 our previous study 28 depicted that calcium concentration decreased with phosphate concentration from 5 to 20 mg l 1 due to the formation of calcium phosphate phase on calcite surface plant et al 38 also found that with initial p concentration 7 5 mg l 1 calcium concentration decreased resulting from phosphate precipitation on calcite our results are in agreement with these results indicating the presence of calcium phosphate precipitation on calcite surface for the corresponding ph results fig 1c there is a small increase in ph value with the addition of phosphate 30 mg l 1 by increasing the initial concentration the phosphate precipitation with ca2 ion will continue to increase and thus the soluble calcium concentration will be reduced maintaining the solubility constant ks calcite will continue to dissolve and release the co3 2 ion finally the ph was increased at caco3 co2 h2o equilibrium as found in the work of michard 39 referring to previous studies 40 under similar experimental conditions it is hypothesized that the precipitated calcium phosphate in present study is amorphous calcium phosphate acp wang and nancollas 41 also proposed that the amorphous calcium phosphate usually forms as a main precursor which could be stabilized kinetically for certain periods of time therefore amorphous calcium phosphate acp was chosen as the main precipitated phase for calculation using minteq in present study according to the studies 36 42 13 a similar calculation using minteq was carried out in this study the calculation results using minteq for calcium concentration and ph were presented in fig 1b and fig 1c from the figures there exists a shift between the experimental and theoretical value for both calcium and ph the shift could be explained as follows 1 the initial caco3 co2 h2o equilibrium might be influenced after phosphate addition the shift may be as a result of this systematic disequilibrium 2 due to lack of precise information on the precipitated phase of calcium phosphate on calcite surface the calculation using minteq with acp as the only final phase might be disputable however the change tendency of experimental and theoretical value with initial p concentration is the same for both calcium and ph for calcium the experimental value is greater than the theoretical value whereas the experimental value is smaller than the theoretical value for ph these results are consistent and reinforce our previous explanation of the shift phenomena 3 1 2 phosphate removal at ph 8 3 system the po4 3 removal rate slightly increased with initial p concentration fig 2 a similar to that of ph7 7 system whereas the po4 3 removal rate showed a bit smaller quantity of about 95 at ph 8 3 system this is in agreement with previous studies 8 13 which reported more significant phosphate precipitations at lower ph phosphate removal at ph 8 3 system was also mainly due to phosphate precipitation on calcite surface the corresponding calcium concentration result fig 2b showed a great decline with initial p concentration analogously this sharp decline was attributed to calcium phosphate precipitation on calcite surface however this type of downward trend was more pronounced compared with that for ph7 7 system fig 1b this could be explained as follows the calcium concentration at ph 8 3 system is about 20 mg l 1 much lower than that at ph7 7 system approximately 400 mg l 1 therefore the decline in calcium concentration is more apparent at ph 8 3 system while the precipitation of calcium phosphate was similar for these two systems in fig 2c the corresponding ph value increased strongly with initial p concentration this increase is consistent with the decline of calcium fig 2b analogously this increase of ph value could be explained as similar to the ph7 7 system after calculations using minteq as done for ph7 7 system a similar coincidence was found the experimental value was greater than theoretical value for calcium whereas the experimental value was smaller than the theoretical value for ph therefore the shift phenomena in fig 2b and fig 2c could be explained same as that for ph7 7 system 3 2 ir xps xrd and bet analysis 3 2 1 ir and xps analysis result at ph7 7 system the ir spectra of all samples are shown in the fig 3 a for all these samples above three apparent spectra are always present 1435 cm 1 876 cm 1 and 712 cm 1 corresponding to the characteristic spectra of calcite 43 44 this indicated that a greater percentage of the basis of the samples is calcite compared to the blank the p loaded calcite has additional peaks the peaks are located at the position of 1034 cm 1 and 602 cm 1 indicated by the dashed line the work of suresh kumar et al 45 synthesizing the nanocomposite of hydroxyapatite calcite found that these peaks are attributed to phosphate group the work of lin et al 15 using high concentration of phosphate for modifying the calcite revealed that the presence of these peaks indicates the phosphate precipitation occurrence and bonding on calcite surface additionally with the increase of p concentration these peaks of 1034 cm 1 and 602 cm 1 became increasingly apparent based on these the observed spectra of additional peaks suggested the occurrence of phosphate precipitation on calcite which was consistent with the results for phosphate removal in section 3 1 at ph7 7 system the xps spectra of all samples are shown in fig 3b the xps spectra for ca 2p c 1s and o 1s regions are always apparently present and located at the same position for the blank and p loaded calcite the aforementioned spectra indicated that the major component of sample p loaded calcite is calcite compared to the spectra of blank a new spectra of p 2p was always present for the spectra of the p loaded calcite the binding energie of the p 2p peak was at the position of about 133 ev which almost agreed with the values for phosphates 46 additionally with the p concentration rising the intensity of the binding energie of p 2p is almost getting stronger suggesting that the precipitation of calcium phosphate become more and more important on the calcite this is also consistent with the phosphate removal result in section 3 1 at ph 8 3 system either the result of ir spectra fig 3c or the result of xps spectra fig 3d is similar to that at ph7 7 system hence the result at ph 8 3 system could be explained analogously as that at ph7 7 system it is also suggested that the phosphate precipitation was occurring at ph 8 3 system according to the ir and xps analysis results 3 2 2 xrd and bet analysis result fig 4 a presents the xrd patterns of all the samples during our experience we discovered that the xrd pattern is always the same for all p loaded calcites at ph7 7 or ph 8 3 the pattern of p loaded calcite e g p of 100 mg l 1 at ph7 7 was chosen for the comparison with that of pure calcite in fig 4a no obvious characteristic diffraction peaks of commercial hydroxide apatite phosphate hap or tricalcium phosphate tcp were observed on the xrd pattern of p loaded calcite the xrd pattern of p loaded calcite fits with the standard diffraction pattern of calcite herein we assume that crystalline calcium phosphate as tcp or hap has little or no occurrence during phosphate precipitation on calcite surface on the contrary we assume that there is a possibility of the occurrence of amorphous calcium phosphate which is also hypothesized in section 3 1 the following supporting evidence were found in other previous studies 1 lin et al 15 found that in using phosphate to modify calcite xrd results show no difference of peak between pure calcite and p loaded calcite even though the precipitated phosphate mass fraction on calcite is about 16 3 mg g 1 much higher than that in present study which is about 2 mg g 1 2 griffin and jurinak 14 and sÃ¸ et al 37 found that the crystalline phosphate calcium such as tcp or hap needs a longer reaction time days or months at normal temperature 3 the study of naidu et al 16 suggested that with the addition of supplemental chemicals such as calcium chloride and ammonium carbonate the crystalline phosphate calcium such as hap will be enhanced however in the present study there is no addition of other supplemental chemicals 4 compared with tcp and hap amorphous calcium phosphate is considered to form faster 41 and could be one of the precursors which may be stabilized kinetically for certain periods of time especially in supersaturated solutions 17 therefore the precipitated phosphate calcium phase in present study is supposed to be amorphous calcium phosphate as suggested in the work of moutin et al 40 however this is only a hypothesis requiring a deep research with microscopic data on the surface of calcite for verification fig 4b presents the specific surface area of p loaded calcite with the increase of initial p concentration the specific surface area of p loaded calcite gradually improved for both ph7 7 and ph 8 3 systems at initial p concentration of 100 mg l 1 the specific surface area of p loaded calcite was around 2 m2 g 1 approximately 3 times that of pure calcite as indicated by the results in section 3 1 with initial p concentration 30 mg l 1 phosphate precipitation was the main phosphate removal mechanism and the phosphate removal rate was about 95 at both ph7 7 and ph 8 3 therefore with the increase of p concentration calcium phosphate precipitation will be more important leading to a greater mixture of calcium phosphate with calcite 40 this calcium phosphate phase is supposed to be the amorphous calcium phosphate as previously proposed by xrd analysis the amorphous calcium phosphate is often known to have a greater specific surface 47 thus the increase of specific surface area of p loaded calcite may be attributed to the mixture of precipitated amorphous calcium phosphate on calcite moreover there is a strong similarity of curve tendency of specific surface area of p loaded calcite between ph7 7 and ph 8 3 systems this reinforces the assertion that the increase in specific surface area of p loaded calcite is mainly due to increase of amorphous calcium phosphate precipitation 3 3 tc removal by p loaded calcite 3 3 1 tc removal at ph7 7 system at ph7 7 system the results of tc removal by pure calcite and p loaded calcite are presented in fig 5 a c the corresponding results of ca and ph were presented in tables 1 3 in fig 5a c the removal rate by pure calcite decreased from 40 to 20 when the initial concentration of tc increased from 5 mg l 1 to 30 mg l 1 this result is consistent with the previous study 28 where tc was adsorbed by forming the inner sphere surface complex with site ca on calcite the study of zhao et al 25 also indicated that the adsorption of tc to goethite surface may be realized through inner sphere complexes with the charged site fe0 5 generally the removal rate of tc by p loaded calcite decreased with the initial tc concentration from 5 mg l 1 to 30 mg l 1 this suggests that the tc removal by p loaded calcite is also by adsorption mechanism compared to that by pure calcite in blank experiment the tc removal rate by p loaded calcite increased significantly with initial p concentration in both cases of humid experiment and dried experiment at different initial concentrations of tc fig 5a c noticeably the tc removal rate was increased to about 100 in the case of higher p concentration e g 100 mg l 1 these results were also confirmed by the insignificant peak on the hplc spectra for tc concentration in the same samples fig s2 the corresponding results of ca and ph tables 2 3 in the experiments using p loaded calcite in either humid experiment or dried experiment showed no significant difference before and after the addition of tc the experimental ph value was kept constant around 7 7 the calcium value after tc addition fluctuated around that before tc addition the above results of ca and ph are also close to that in blank experiment using pure calcite according to table 1 since the corresponding results of ca and ph in final solution do not exhibit any significant difference between the experiments using pure calcite or p loaded calcite the improvement of tc removal by p loaded calcite was therefore not due to the change in the solution chemistry caused by addition of phosphate or tc it is assumed that the significant difference of tc removal rate between pure calcite and p loaded calcite may be linked to modification of calcite surface as supposed previously in section 3 2 the newly formed amorphous calcium phosphate occurred this type of amorphous calcium phosphate may deposit on the calcite surface and remain for a certain period of time 16 11 also according to mukherjee et al 18 tc can be loaded with calcium phosphate nanoparticle cpnp due to its higher affinity for chelating with divalent metal ions such as ca2 it is therefore presumed that the significant improvement of tc removal rate by p loaded calcite is due to adsorption of tc on the precipitated amorphous calcium phosphate as the phosphate concentration increased the precipitation of amorphous calcium phosphate also improved which has been indicated by the bet analysis in section 3 2 comparing the tc removal rates by p loaded calcites humid experiment and dried experiment there is no great difference for tc of 5 mg l 1 it may be that less concentration of tc caused a higher removal rate leaving no obvious difference between humid experiment and dried experiment however for tc of 15 mg l 1 and 30 mg l 1 we observed a slight decreasing trend of tc removal rate in dried experiment compared to humid experiment a possible explanation could be that the precipitated calcium phosphate may have dissolved a little when the dried p loaded calcite was put in the eqw without phosphate concentration being in disequilibrium with respect to the solid phase calcium phosphate this may cause a variation of the p loaded calcite surface and therefore the difference of tc removal rate the study of lin et al 15 suggested that in the case of disequilibrium there is the possibility of the dissolution for p loaded calcite in the test for the release of retained phosphate the result in fig 6 indicated that when dried p loaded calcite was put in the eqw there was a small release of retained phosphate no more than 1 suzuki et al 48 also suggested that even at a low phosphate concentration the phosphate could be irreversibly incorporated into the calcite lattice the kinetic results were presented in fig 7 a b the results showed that the tc adsorption by p loaded calcite reached the equilibrium within 2 h either in humid experiment or in dried experiment the tc adsorption isotherm results were demonstrated in fig 7c d the corresponding results indicated that the adsorption correlated better with langmuir than freundlich isotherm model based on the correlation coefficient r2 in tables s3 s4 the maximum adsorption of tc qm by p loaded calcite increased along with the initial p concentration increasing 3 3 2 tc removal at ph 8 3 system at ph 8 3 system the results of tc removal by pure calcite and p loaded calcite are presented in figs 8 a c the corresponding results of ca and ph were presented in tables 4 6 as shown in fig 8a c the tc removal rate decreases with the increase of initial tc concentration either by pure calcite or p loaded calcite this result is in agreement with that at ph7 7 system fig 5 the tc removal could then be attributed to the adsorption mechanism moreover if tc removal is by the precipitation of calcium ion with tc the tc removal rate at ph7 7 should be much greater than that at ph 8 3 because the calcium concentration at ph7 7 is about 10 times higher than that at ph 8 3 however it was not the case for the case of the humid experiment as shown in table 5 the ph value in the final solution ranged from 8 3 8 6 similar to that before tc addition the calcium value in the final solution was also close to that before tc addition and the calcium value was around 15 mg l 1 see table 5 the final ph value was a little higher than that in blank experiment see table 4 according to our previous study 28 tc removal decreased as ph increased ph 8 3 if calcite surface remains almost unchanged the tc removal by p loaded calcite should be less in the humid experiment compared to that by pure calcite however tc removal rate in the humid experiment was much higher than that in the blank experiment this implied that the improvement of tc removal might be related to the p loaded calcite surface for the case of the dried experiment as shown in table 6 the ph value in final solution was always around the value of 8 3 similar to that before tc addition the calcium value in final solution was almost the same as that before tc addition at about 23 mg l 1 see table 6 the ph and calcium value in final solution was close to that in blank experiment see table 4 if calcite surface remains almost unchanged the tc removal by p loaded calcite in the dried experiment should be similar to that by pure calcite in blank experiment however there is also a significant improvement of tc removal in the dried experiment it is assumed that the improvement of tc removal might also be related to the p loaded calcite surface the tc removal improvement could be explained in the same way as that at ph7 7 system that is due to the adsorption of tc on the amorphous calcium phosphate depositing on calcite surface compared to humid experiment there was a slight decreasing trend of tc removal rate in dried experiment this similar phenomenon allows us to explain the same way as that for ph7 7 system precipitated calcium phosphate may have dissolved a little in the case of dried experiment as shown in fig 6 less than 1 of retained phosphate was released from the calcite surface which is consistent with the above explanation in addition according to the calcium results in section 3 1 see fig 2b there was a significant decrease in calcium concentration due to calcium phosphate precipitation on calcite basically if there is a significant reversible dissolution of precipitated calcium phosphate the increase of calcium concentration should be observed here however this was not the case at the same initial concentration of tc the tc removal rates at ph7 7 and ph 8 3 are close to each other in the case of p loaded calcite either humid experiment or dried experiment li et al 28 suggested that the mechanism of tc removal by calcite is probably through the adsorption of tch2 and tch species with calcium site ca on calcite according to the speciation of tc under different ph see fig s4 the summation of tch2 and tch species is close at both ph7 7 and ph 8 3 the result of specific surface area of p loaded calcite fig 4 showed the similarities at both ph7 7 and ph 8 3 systems from these findings in the present study we hypothesized that the tc adsorption on p loaded calcite was also through tch2 and tch species with calcium site ca generated by precipitated amorphous calcium phosphate and calcite at ph 8 3 system the kinetic and adsorption isotherm result fig 9 is similar to that at ph7 7 system fig 7 hence the corresponding result at ph 8 3 system could be explained analogously as that at ph7 7 system the tc adsorption by p loaded calcite could be accomplished within 2 h either in humid experiment or in dried experiment based on the correlation coefficient r2 in tables s5 s6 langumir model could describe better tc adsorption isotherm than freundlich model 4 conclusions based on our study tetracycline removal could be realized through the sustainable and environmental friendly reutilization of abandoned calcite the calcite was employed for phosphate removal in a first step then this used calcite p loaded calcite was reutilized for tc removal under different conditions ph phosphate concentration dried state and humid state the results showed that 1 when the initial p concentration was from 30 to 100 mg l 1 the phosphate removal rate was almost above 95 at both ph7 7 and ph 8 3 systems the corresponding ph and calcium results confirmed that the phosphate removal due to precipitation occurred significantly within 24 h 2 the results of ir xps xrd and bet analysis suggested that the precipitated phase on calcite was likely to be amorphous calcium phosphate 3 at both ph7 7 and ph 8 3 systems the removal rate of tc by p loaded calcite was significantly improved compared to that by pure calcite especially with a higher initial p concentration this may be attributed to the adsorption of tc on the precipitated phase of amorphous phosphate calcium which has a larger specific surface area and generates an increasing number of ca sites 4 the similarity of tc removal by p loaded calcite between ph7 7 and ph 8 3 systems allowed us to hypothesize that tc removal may be due to adsorption of tch2 and tch species adsorption on ca sites 5 the slight decreasing trend of tc removal rate in dried experiment compared to humid experiment could result from the small dissolution of precipitated calcium phosphate on calcite our research will serve as reference knowledge for the reutilization of abandoned calcite in phosphate removal which provides a new way to reduce the wasted materials and environmental risks induced by tetracycline however this present study was limited by lack of microscopic data to directly prove precipitated calcium phosphate phase and tc adsorption mechanism on pure calcite or p loaded calcite in future study we envisage to carry out this type of study to elucidate further the adsorption complex of tc on calcite surface

13875,the excess phosphate and tetracycline tc in natural environments potentially threatens ecosystem few studies were conducted on efficient and cost effective method for dealing with these pollutants together we attempted to reutilize this abandoned calcite for the removal of other pollutant in wastewater such as tetracycline firstly removal of high concentration phosphate by calcite was studied in batch experiments thereafter removal of tc by this used calcite p loaded calcite was investigated under different conditions ph phosphate concentration dried state and humid state using calcite for high concentration phosphate removal the results showed that 1 concentrations of phosphate higher than 30 mg l 1 resulted in a significant phosphate precipitation on calcite surface at both ph7 7 and ph 8 3 within 24 h the corresponding ph and calcium results confirmed this precipitation occurrence 2 the precipitated phase was supposed to be amorphous calcium phosphate through the results of ir xps xrd and bet analysis compared to that by pure calcite the tc removal rate by p loaded calcite increased significantly with the initial phosphate concentration in both cases of humid experiment and dried experiment this may be attributed to the adsorption of tc on the precipitated amorphous calcium phosphate which has a larger specific surface and increasingly generates ca sites from the similarity of tc removal rate by p loaded calcite between ph7 7 and ph 8 3 it is hypothesized that tc removal is due to tch2 and tch adsorption on ca sites the minor difference of tc removal rate by p loaded calcites between humid experiment and dried experiment is mainly due to slight dissolution of precipitated amorphous calcium phosphate our research will serve as reference knowledge for the reutilization of abandoned calcite in phosphate removal which provides a new way to reduce the wasted materials and environmental risks induced by tetracycline keywords tetracycline calcite phosphate adsorption precipitation 1 introduction phosphate po4 3 is recognized as one of the key elements that impair the aquatic environmental quality since excess of phosphorous p supply can cause eutrophication to water body 1 4 phosphorus recovery from wastewater has been of great importance calcite caco3 is a common mineral in the hydrosphere and lithosphere 5 and has the potential to retain po4 3 thereby reducing its mobility considering the importance of calcite in p control the interaction between po4 3 and calcite surface has been widely studied 6 14 through these studies it can be found that at low concentration phosphate was retained on calcite by surface adsorption mechanism in this case the used calcite could be utilized as fertilizer in the acid soil on the other hand at high concentration phosphate was mainly removed by surface precipitation in the form of calcium phosphate this used calcite could be recycled for the phosphate removal and even this type of used calcite could be more efficient than the original calcite because newly formed calcium phosphate crystals have covered their surfaces 10 however based on these reports it can be observed that the used calcite could be reused simply in the domain concerning phosphate apparently there are few studies concerning the application of these used calcites phosphate loaded calcites on the removal of other pollutant especially after high concentration phosphate removal in fact after high concentration phosphate removal by calcite the calcite surface could be covered by the precipitation of calcium phosphate this seems to be a type of modification of calcite surface 15 is it possible that the used calcite could be utilized for removing other pollutant after high concentration phosphate removal with these purposes in the present study we try to utilize this type of used calcite for tetracycline tc removal the reasons are as follows 1 as is mentioned previously the phosphate at high concentration could be precipitated on calcite surface by forming a mixture of the apatite family 16 11 8 such as dicalcium phosphate dihydrate dcpd octacalcium phosphate ocp and amorphous calcium phosphate acp which could be existing for a certain period of time 13 17 and finally transited to the most stable phase of hydroxyapatite hap 2 according to the study 18 tc can easily bind with calcium phosphate nano particles in addition the apatite family can be utilized in tc delivery since tc is well known to have a good affinity with calcium phosphate 18 19 3 the abundance of tetracycline tc in natural environments potentially threatens ecosystem functions tc removal is also the focus of many studies recently adsorption of tc on clay minerals were frequently reported such as kaolinite 20 rectorite 21 smectite 22 montmorillonite 23 24 goethite 25 however few studies have been carried out for the removal of tc by carbonate mineral considered as natural material calcite is one of the most abundant carbonate minerals in the earth s lithosphere and biosphere 26 27 in our previous study 28 it was discovered that the pure calcite has a certain removal capacity for tc it is interesting to see whether there is any improvement of tc removal by this used calcite phosphate loaded calcite after removing high concentrated phosphate compared to the pure calcite in order to achieve our goal the following procedure will be followed as 1 firstly we should try to understand the modifications of calcite surface and the aqueous chemistry change in solution after removal of high concentration phosphate 2 thereafter we will try to observe how much more tetracycline can be retained on the surface of used calcite phosphate loaded calcite compared to the pure calcite we believe that our research will serve as reference knowledge for the reutilization of abandoned calcite in phosphate removal which provides a new way to reduce the wasted materials and environmental risks induced by tetracycline 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials potassium dihydrogen phosphate 99 5 purity was sourced from shanghai ling feng chemical reagent co ltd tetracycline hydrochloride usp grade was purchased from aladdin industrial corporation the mother solutions of these chemicals were prepared using milliq water calcite 99 purity used in this study was supplied by xirong chemistry company china 2 2 choice of ph and production of pre equilibrated water high concentrated phosphate can easily precipitate on calcite at ph of 8 3 according to the previous study 13 moreover results from another study 28 revealed that tc could be adsorbed significantly at ph levels between 7 7 and 8 7 taking these facts into account the experimental ph chosen were ph7 7 and ph 8 3 for the removal of phosphate and tetracycline in current study as the concentration of dissolved carbon dioxide is known to have strong effects on the surface chemistry of calcite and its solubility 29 30 the experiment with calcite in present study was studied under calco carbonic equilibrium conditions i e atmospheric co2 calcite phase and the solution species are at quasi thermodynamic equilibrium additionally calco carbonic equilibrium conditions were considered as a good condition for appropriate characterization of the surface reaction of calcite 31 as shown in fig s1 equilibrium water eqw was produced by the following steps 1 10 g of calcite was put into 8 l of ultrapure water reservoir 2 using visual minteq 3 1 32 quantitative hydrochloric acid hcl or sodium hydroxide naoh was added into the reservoir to adjust the ph 3 water reservoir was aerated continuously by bubbling filter and humidified air through the water at constant ambient atmospheric pressure until the equilibrium was achieved after equilibrium eqw was obtained by filtration via 0 45 Î¼m cellulose acetate filter the experimental and theoretical values of ph ionic strength and aqueous calcium of eqw are listed in table s1 as well as the details of acid or base additions 2 3 experiment of high concentration phosphate removal and tc removal typically 2 g of calcite was put into a 250 ml tube containing 40 ml eqw to ensure the caco3 co2 h2o equilibrium at a constant ph 7 7 and 8 3 the tube was covered by parafilm with tiny punctures subsequently put in thermostatic oscillator 150 rpm at 25 c for 24 h 33 finally ph was measured to confirm the caco3 co2 h2o equilibrium in our previous work 13 it was found that under calco carbonic equilibrium condition at ph 8 3 phosphate precipitations are significantly increased by initial po4 3 concentration at 10 mg l 1 after 24 h of reaction time similarly griffin and jurinak 14 reported that the higher the initial concentration the faster the precipitation of phosphate in the present study we used po4 3 at different concentrations of 30 50 75 and 100 mg l 1 to ensure phosphate precipitation on calcite the tubes were placed in a thermostatic oscillator and shaken for 24 h all the experiments were replicated 6 times to examine the effect of phosphate on removal of tc by calcite the aforementioned six 6 sample tubes were divided into two parts 2 sample tubes for part 1 and 4 for part 2 part 1 two 2 sample tubes were chosen for experiments of tc removal the experiment was carried out as follows aliquots of tetracycline were put into the tubes with varying concentrations 5 15 and 30 mg l 1 the tubes were then covered by parafilm with tiny punctures and shaken again in a thermostatic oscillator based on several trials 2 h was chosen as the equilibration time for present study of tc removal as found in our previous study 28 after 2 h of equilibration time the experimental ph was measured and the solution was centrifuged for 5 min at 4000 rpm the supernatant solution was immediately displaced for analysis of calcium concentration phosphate concentration and tetracycline concentration we designated this type of experiment as humid experiment part 2 the remaining four 4 sample tubes were then centrifuged for 5 min at 4000 rpm after centrifugation the supernatant was almost completely poured out and then analyzed for the ph calcium concentration and phosphate concentration the residual calcite in tubes was washed slightly by water and then placed in an oven at 30 for 12 h of drying two 2 of these 4 dried calcite samples were kept for bet x ray diffraction xrd ir and xps analysis the remaining 2 dried calcite samples were then put in 250 ml tubes with 40 ml of eqw for experiments of tc removal thereafter experimentation for tc removal in part 2 was carried out in the same manner as that in part 1 we designated this experiment of tc removal in part 2 as dried experiment meanwhile several tubes containing pure calcite were prepared for tc removal experiment for comparison with the aforementioned experiment we designated this experiment of tc removal by pure calcite as blank experiment in addition the kinetic and isotherm study of tc adsorption on p loaded calcite were also conducted the corresponding procedure was similar to that previously stated in humid experiment and dried experiment in kinetic study the initial tc concentration of 5 mg l 1 was used and the reaction time was set to 0 25 0 5 1 2 4 8 and 12 h respectively in isotherm study the initial tc concentrations of 5 100 mg l 1 were employed 2 4 test for release of retained phosphate from calcite this additional experiment was carried out to find out the possibility of a release of the retained phosphate on calcite after the interaction between phosphate and calcite as described in section 2 3 the tube containing calcite was centrifuged the supernatant denoted supernatant 1 was almost completely poured out for analysis of phosphate concentration as c1 and the total weight of the humid solid calcite was measured as m1 then the tube was heated in an oven at a temperature of 30 c for 12 h after being dried the mass of the dried calcite was denoted as m2 thereafter 40 ml of corresponding eqw was poured into the tube and the tube was put into the shaker for 12 h subsequently the tube containing calcite was centrifuged and the final supernatant was denoted as supernatant 2 which was analyzed for phosphate concentration c2 the mass of released phosphate could be calculated by the following formula 40 1000 c2 m1 m2 1000 c1 all these outlined experimental procedures were repeated twice 2 5 analytical method the concentration of po4 3 was analyzed spectrophotometrically using the ammonium molybdate blue method according to ds en iso 6878 2004 34 the amount of po4 3 removal was calculated as the differences between the initial and final aqueous concentration the calcium concentration was analyzed by atomic absorption spectroscopy agilent 3150 g calibration for calcium analysis was made with 5 standards between 0 5 and 2 5 mg l 1 with r2 not less than 0 99 the limit of detection for calcium analysis was 0 2 mg l 1 the ph was measured by ph meter phsj 4 f shanghai inesa before and after the interaction with phosphate the calcite was characterized as follows the powder x ray diffraction patterns xrd of calcite were recorded on bruker axs d8 advance model powder diffractometer the bet surface area of calcite was determined by n2 multipoint gas adsorption autosorb 1 c quantachrome usa spectroscopic studies in the infrared ir regions 4000 400 cm 1 were carried out using fourier transform spectrometer digilab fts 60mvpc bio rad standard transmission technique was used spectra were collected after 256 scans at 4 cm 1 resolution the xps analysis was performed by the spectrometer escalab 250 with mg ka irradiation as x ray source tetracycline hydrochloride was utilized as a single type of tetracyclines in present study the tc concentrations were determined by high performance liquid chromatography hplc the mobile phase consisted of ultrapure water a and methanol b the gradient system was conducted as follows 0 3 min 10 b 3 10 min 10 75 b 10 13 min 75 75 b 13 15 min 75 10 b 15 17 min 10 10 b the ï¬ow rate of mobile phase was 1 ml min from the beginning until 17 min 50 Î¼l of the sample was injected into the instrument the detection wavelength was set at 357 nm referring to the study on removal of tetracycline hydrochloride 35 as experimental ph is a bit alkaline and tc is supposed to decompose easily in basic condition it is necessary to confirm the accuracy of interpretation of tc removal by hplc method for this justification 4 samples were prepared one sample as standard was the 15 mg l 1 of tc in eqw the other 3 samples were the samples for the 15 mg l 1 of tc removal in corresponding experiments blank experiment humid experiment and dried experiment the analytical results by hplc for these samples were presented in fig s2 fig s2 indicated that there is always just one characteristic peak present at the same position of about 10 min for these 4 samples the peak height for sample with calcite exhibited an obvious chute compared to that without calcite hence it is suggested that tc is possibly removed by its reaction with calcite rather than its own decomposition also as some other non negligible ions such as ca2 po4 3 were present in tc solution additional experiment was conducted to verify if there is precipitation of tc with ca2 and if there is interference of other ions for tc analysis with hplc additional experiment calibration for tc analysis was made with 6 standards between 0 and 30 mg l 1 for doing 3 types of calibration we chose 3 different matrixes for preparing the standards of tc such as milliq water cacl2 solution 0 1 mol l 1 for ca2 concentration much more important than that in present study and potassium phosphate solution 10 mg l 1 for p concentration much higher than that in our final sample solution prior to the analysis these standards were also shaken in thermostatic oscillator as same as for the samples the results in fig s3 demonstrate that these 3 calibration lines are almost the same with r2 exceeding 0 99 it therefore suggested that there is no interference of other ions such as phosphate for the tc analysis and also there is no occurrence of precipitation of tc with ca2 in the present study visual minteq 3 1 was deployed to calculate equilibrium speciation in the solution using the default equilibrium constants in its database 32 36 the equilibrium constants concerning the system phosphate calcite co2 h2o are listed in table s2 langumuir and freundlich functions were employed for describing the isotherm curve they are presented as follows 1 l a n g m u i r q e q m k l c e 1 k l c e ce the tc equilibrium

mg1 n ln g 1 n the linear coefficients 3 results and discussions 3 1 phosphate removal by calcite 3 1 1 phosphate removal at ph7 7 system as shown in fig 1 a the po4 3 removal rate did not decrease with initial p concentration from 30 to 100 mg l 1 it rather increased slowly and gradually approached 100 ordinarily if po4 3 removal is mainly by surface adsorption the po4 3 removal rate appears to decrease with increasing initial po4 3 concentration 14 however our results contradict with the adsorption assumption and this may be due to the fact that po4 3 removal is mainly by precipitation on calcite surface a similar experimental work 37 observed that with initial p concentration of 3 mg l 1 at ph of 7 5 more than 60 of po4 3 removal is attributed to po4 3 precipitation on calcite after 24 h reaction time in our recent work 13 after 24 h reaction time in a ph7 7 system the po4 3 removal percentage was about 95 with initial p concentration of 10 mg l 1 where surface precipitation of po4 3 was the main removal mechanism additionally griffin and jurinak 14 suggested that the higher the initial concentration the faster the precipitation of phosphate on calcite surface based on these findings we proposed that a large portion of po4 3 at concentration of 30 mg l 1 can significantly precipitate on calcite surface within 24 h reaction time in present study the corresponding calcium concentration fig 1b was found to be around 400 mg l 1 and exhibited a small decrease with initial p concentration 30 mg l 1 our previous study 28 depicted that calcium concentration decreased with phosphate concentration from 5 to 20 mg l 1 due to the formation of calcium phosphate phase on calcite surface plant et al 38 also found that with initial p concentration 7 5 mg l 1 calcium concentration decreased resulting from phosphate precipitation on calcite our results are in agreement with these results indicating the presence of calcium phosphate precipitation on calcite surface for the corresponding ph results fig 1c there is a small increase in ph value with the addition of phosphate 30 mg l 1 by increasing the initial concentration the phosphate precipitation with ca2 ion will continue to increase and thus the soluble calcium concentration will be reduced maintaining the solubility constant ks calcite will continue to dissolve and release the co3 2 ion finally the ph was increased at caco3 co2 h2o equilibrium as found in the work of michard 39 referring to previous studies 40 under similar experimental conditions it is hypothesized that the precipitated calcium phosphate in present study is amorphous calcium phosphate acp wang and nancollas 41 also proposed that the amorphous calcium phosphate usually forms as a main precursor which could be stabilized kinetically for certain periods of time therefore amorphous calcium phosphate acp was chosen as the main precipitated phase for calculation using minteq in present study according to the studies 36 42 13 a similar calculation using minteq was carried out in this study the calculation results using minteq for calcium concentration and ph were presented in fig 1b and fig 1c from the figures there exists a shift between the experimental and theoretical value for both calcium and ph the shift could be explained as follows 1 the initial caco3 co2 h2o equilibrium might be influenced after phosphate addition the shift may be as a result of this systematic disequilibrium 2 due to lack of precise information on the precipitated phase of calcium phosphate on calcite surface the calculation using minteq with acp as the only final phase might be disputable however the change tendency of experimental and theoretical value with initial p concentration is the same for both calcium and ph for calcium the experimental value is greater than the theoretical value whereas the experimental value is smaller than the theoretical value for ph these results are consistent and reinforce our previous explanation of the shift phenomena 3 1 2 phosphate removal at ph 8 3 system the po4 3 removal rate slightly increased with initial p concentration fig 2 a similar to that of ph7 7 system whereas the po4 3 removal rate showed a bit smaller quantity of about 95 at ph 8 3 system this is in agreement with previous studies 8 13 which reported more significant phosphate precipitations at lower ph phosphate removal at ph 8 3 system was also mainly due to phosphate precipitation on calcite surface the corresponding calcium concentration result fig 2b showed a great decline with initial p concentration analogously this sharp decline was attributed to calcium phosphate precipitation on calcite surface however this type of downward trend was more pronounced compared with that for ph7 7 system fig 1b this could be explained as follows the calcium concentration at ph 8 3 system is about 20 mg l 1 much lower than that at ph7 7 system approximately 400 mg l 1 therefore the decline in calcium concentration is more apparent at ph 8 3 system while the precipitation of calcium phosphate was similar for these two systems in fig 2c the corresponding ph value increased strongly with initial p concentration this increase is consistent with the decline of calcium fig 2b analogously this increase of ph value could be explained as similar to the ph7 7 system after calculations using minteq as done for ph7 7 system a similar coincidence was found the experimental value was greater than theoretical value for calcium whereas the experimental value was smaller than the theoretical value for ph therefore the shift phenomena in fig 2b and fig 2c could be explained same as that for ph7 7 system 3 2 ir xps xrd and bet analysis 3 2 1 ir and xps analysis result at ph7 7 system the ir spectra of all samples are shown in the fig 3 a for all these samples above three apparent spectra are always present 1435 cm 1 876 cm 1 and 712 cm 1 corresponding to the characteristic spectra of calcite 43 44 this indicated that a greater percentage of the basis of the samples is calcite compared to the blank the p loaded calcite has additional peaks the peaks are located at the position of 1034 cm 1 and 602 cm 1 indicated by the dashed line the work of suresh kumar et al 45 synthesizing the nanocomposite of hydroxyapatite calcite found that these peaks are attributed to phosphate group the work of lin et al 15 using high concentration of phosphate for modifying the calcite revealed that the presence of these peaks indicates the phosphate precipitation occurrence and bonding on calcite surface additionally with the increase of p concentration these peaks of 1034 cm 1 and 602 cm 1 became increasingly apparent based on these the observed spectra of additional peaks suggested the occurrence of phosphate precipitation on calcite which was consistent with the results for phosphate removal in section 3 1 at ph7 7 system the xps spectra of all samples are shown in fig 3b the xps spectra for ca 2p c 1s and o 1s regions are always apparently present and located at the same position for the blank and p loaded calcite the aforementioned spectra indicated that the major component of sample p loaded calcite is calcite compared to the spectra of blank a new spectra of p 2p was always present for the spectra of the p loaded calcite the binding energie of the p 2p peak was at the position of about 133 ev which almost agreed with the values for phosphates 46 additionally with the p concentration rising the intensity of the binding energie of p 2p is almost getting stronger suggesting that the precipitation of calcium phosphate become more and more important on the calcite this is also consistent with the phosphate removal result in section 3 1 at ph 8 3 system either the result of ir spectra fig 3c or the result of xps spectra fig 3d is similar to that at ph7 7 system hence the result at ph 8 3 system could be explained analogously as that at ph7 7 system it is also suggested that the phosphate precipitation was occurring at ph 8 3 system according to the ir and xps analysis results 3 2 2 xrd and bet analysis result fig 4 a presents the xrd patterns of all the samples during our experience we discovered that the xrd pattern is always the same for all p loaded calcites at ph7 7 or ph 8 3 the pattern of p loaded calcite e g p of 100 mg l 1 at ph7 7 was chosen for the comparison with that of pure calcite in fig 4a no obvious characteristic diffraction peaks of commercial hydroxide apatite phosphate hap or tricalcium phosphate tcp were observed on the xrd pattern of p loaded calcite the xrd pattern of p loaded calcite fits with the standard diffraction pattern of calcite herein we assume that crystalline calcium phosphate as tcp or hap has little or no occurrence during phosphate precipitation on calcite surface on the contrary we assume that there is a possibility of the occurrence of amorphous calcium phosphate which is also hypothesized in section 3 1 the following supporting evidence were found in other previous studies 1 lin et al 15 found that in using phosphate to modify calcite xrd results show no difference of peak between pure calcite and p loaded calcite even though the precipitated phosphate mass fraction on calcite is about 16 3 mg g 1 much higher than that in present study which is about 2 mg g 1 2 griffin and jurinak 14 and sÃ¸ et al 37 found that the crystalline phosphate calcium such as tcp or hap needs a longer reaction time days or months at normal temperature 3 the study of naidu et al 16 suggested that with the addition of supplemental chemicals such as calcium chloride and ammonium carbonate the crystalline phosphate calcium such as hap will be enhanced however in the present study there is no addition of other supplemental chemicals 4 compared with tcp and hap amorphous calcium phosphate is considered to form faster 41 and could be one of the precursors which may be stabilized kinetically for certain periods of time especially in supersaturated solutions 17 therefore the precipitated phosphate calcium phase in present study is supposed to be amorphous calcium phosphate as suggested in the work of moutin et al 40 however this is only a hypothesis requiring a deep research with microscopic data on the surface of calcite for verification fig 4b presents the specific surface area of p loaded calcite with the increase of initial p concentration the specific surface area of p loaded calcite gradually improved for both ph7 7 and ph 8 3 systems at initial p concentration of 100 mg l 1 the specific surface area of p loaded calcite was around 2 m2 g 1 approximately 3 times that of pure calcite as indicated by the results in section 3 1 with initial p concentration 30 mg l 1 phosphate precipitation was the main phosphate removal mechanism and the phosphate removal rate was about 95 at both ph7 7 and ph 8 3 therefore with the increase of p concentration calcium phosphate precipitation will be more important leading to a greater mixture of calcium phosphate with calcite 40 this calcium phosphate phase is supposed to be the amorphous calcium phosphate as previously proposed by xrd analysis the amorphous calcium phosphate is often known to have a greater specific surface 47 thus the increase of specific surface area of p loaded calcite may be attributed to the mixture of precipitated amorphous calcium phosphate on calcite moreover there is a strong similarity of curve tendency of specific surface area of p loaded calcite between ph7 7 and ph 8 3 systems this reinforces the assertion that the increase in specific surface area of p loaded calcite is mainly due to increase of amorphous calcium phosphate precipitation 3 3 tc removal by p loaded calcite 3 3 1 tc removal at ph7 7 system at ph7 7 system the results of tc removal by pure calcite and p loaded calcite are presented in fig 5 a c the corresponding results of ca and ph were presented in tables 1 3 in fig 5a c the removal rate by pure calcite decreased from 40 to 20 when the initial concentration of tc increased from 5 mg l 1 to 30 mg l 1 this result is consistent with the previous study 28 where tc was adsorbed by forming the inner sphere surface complex with site ca on calcite the study of zhao et al 25 also indicated that the adsorption of tc to goethite surface may be realized through inner sphere complexes with the charged site fe0 5 generally the removal rate of tc by p loaded calcite decreased with the initial tc concentration from 5 mg l 1 to 30 mg l 1 this suggests that the tc removal by p loaded calcite is also by adsorption mechanism compared to that by pure calcite in blank experiment the tc removal rate by p loaded calcite increased significantly with initial p concentration in both cases of humid experiment and dried experiment at different initial concentrations of tc fig 5a c noticeably the tc removal rate was increased to about 100 in the case of higher p concentration e g 100 mg l 1 these results were also confirmed by the insignificant peak on the hplc spectra for tc concentration in the same samples fig s2 the corresponding results of ca and ph tables 2 3 in the experiments using p loaded calcite in either humid experiment or dried experiment showed no significant difference before and after the addition of tc the experimental ph value was kept constant around 7 7 the calcium value after tc addition fluctuated around that before tc addition the above results of ca and ph are also close to that in blank experiment using pure calcite according to table 1 since the corresponding results of ca and ph in final solution do not exhibit any significant difference between the experiments using pure calcite or p loaded calcite the improvement of tc removal by p loaded calcite was therefore not due to the change in the solution chemistry caused by addition of phosphate or tc it is assumed that the significant difference of tc removal rate between pure calcite and p loaded calcite may be linked to modification of calcite surface as supposed previously in section 3 2 the newly formed amorphous calcium phosphate occurred this type of amorphous calcium phosphate may deposit on the calcite surface and remain for a certain period of time 16 11 also according to mukherjee et al 18 tc can be loaded with calcium phosphate nanoparticle cpnp due to its higher affinity for chelating with divalent metal ions such as ca2 it is therefore presumed that the significant improvement of tc removal rate by p loaded calcite is due to adsorption of tc on the precipitated amorphous calcium phosphate as the phosphate concentration increased the precipitation of amorphous calcium phosphate also improved which has been indicated by the bet analysis in section 3 2 comparing the tc removal rates by p loaded calcites humid experiment and dried experiment there is no great difference for tc of 5 mg l 1 it may be that less concentration of tc caused a higher removal rate leaving no obvious difference between humid experiment and dried experiment however for tc of 15 mg l 1 and 30 mg l 1 we observed a slight decreasing trend of tc removal rate in dried experiment compared to humid experiment a possible explanation could be that the precipitated calcium phosphate may have dissolved a little when the dried p loaded calcite was put in the eqw without phosphate concentration being in disequilibrium with respect to the solid phase calcium phosphate this may cause a variation of the p loaded calcite surface and therefore the difference of tc removal rate the study of lin et al 15 suggested that in the case of disequilibrium there is the possibility of the dissolution for p loaded calcite in the test for the release of retained phosphate the result in fig 6 indicated that when dried p loaded calcite was put in the eqw there was a small release of retained phosphate no more than 1 suzuki et al 48 also suggested that even at a low phosphate concentration the phosphate could be irreversibly incorporated into the calcite lattice the kinetic results were presented in fig 7 a b the results showed that the tc adsorption by p loaded calcite reached the equilibrium within 2 h either in humid experiment or in dried experiment the tc adsorption isotherm results were demonstrated in fig 7c d the corresponding results indicated that the adsorption correlated better with langmuir than freundlich isotherm model based on the correlation coefficient r2 in tables s3 s4 the maximum adsorption of tc qm by p loaded calcite increased along with the initial p concentration increasing 3 3 2 tc removal at ph 8 3 system at ph 8 3 system the results of tc removal by pure calcite and p loaded calcite are presented in figs 8 a c the corresponding results of ca and ph were presented in tables 4 6 as shown in fig 8a c the tc removal rate decreases with the increase of initial tc concentration either by pure calcite or p loaded calcite this result is in agreement with that at ph7 7 system fig 5 the tc removal could then be attributed to the adsorption mechanism moreover if tc removal is by the precipitation of calcium ion with tc the tc removal rate at ph7 7 should be much greater than that at ph 8 3 because the calcium concentration at ph7 7 is about 10 times higher than that at ph 8 3 however it was not the case for the case of the humid experiment as shown in table 5 the ph value in the final solution ranged from 8 3 8 6 similar to that before tc addition the calcium value in the final solution was also close to that before tc addition and the calcium value was around 15 mg l 1 see table 5 the final ph value was a little higher than that in blank experiment see table 4 according to our previous study 28 tc removal decreased as ph increased ph 8 3 if calcite surface remains almost unchanged the tc removal by p loaded calcite should be less in the humid experiment compared to that by pure calcite however tc removal rate in the humid experiment was much higher than that in the blank experiment this implied that the improvement of tc removal might be related to the p loaded calcite surface for the case of the dried experiment as shown in table 6 the ph value in final solution was always around the value of 8 3 similar to that before tc addition the calcium value in final solution was almost the same as that before tc addition at about 23 mg l 1 see table 6 the ph and calcium value in final solution was close to that in blank experiment see table 4 if calcite surface remains almost unchanged the tc removal by p loaded calcite in the dried experiment should be similar to that by pure calcite in blank experiment however there is also a significant improvement of tc removal in the dried experiment it is assumed that the improvement of tc removal might also be related to the p loaded calcite surface the tc removal improvement could be explained in the same way as that at ph7 7 system that is due to the adsorption of tc on the amorphous calcium phosphate depositing on calcite surface compared to humid experiment there was a slight decreasing trend of tc removal rate in dried experiment this similar phenomenon allows us to explain the same way as that for ph7 7 system precipitated calcium phosphate may have dissolved a little in the case of dried experiment as shown in fig 6 less than 1 of retained phosphate was released from the calcite surface which is consistent with the above explanation in addition according to the calcium results in section 3 1 see fig 2b there was a significant decrease in calcium concentration due to calcium phosphate precipitation on calcite basically if there is a significant reversible dissolution of precipitated calcium phosphate the increase of calcium concentration should be observed here however this was not the case at the same initial concentration of tc the tc removal rates at ph7 7 and ph 8 3 are close to each other in the case of p loaded calcite either humid experiment or dried experiment li et al 28 suggested that the mechanism of tc removal by calcite is probably through the adsorption of tch2 and tch species with calcium site ca on calcite according to the speciation of tc under different ph see fig s4 the summation of tch2 and tch species is close at both ph7 7 and ph 8 3 the result of specific surface area of p loaded calcite fig 4 showed the similarities at both ph7 7 and ph 8 3 systems from these findings in the present study we hypothesized that the tc adsorption on p loaded calcite was also through tch2 and tch species with calcium site ca generated by precipitated amorphous calcium phosphate and calcite at ph 8 3 system the kinetic and adsorption isotherm result fig 9 is similar to that at ph7 7 system fig 7 hence the corresponding result at ph 8 3 system could be explained analogously as that at ph7 7 system the tc adsorption by p loaded calcite could be accomplished within 2 h either in humid experiment or in dried experiment based on the correlation coefficient r2 in tables s5 s6 langumir model could describe better tc adsorption isotherm than freundlich model 4 conclusions based on our study tetracycline removal could be realized through the sustainable and environmental friendly reutilization of abandoned calcite the calcite was employed for phosphate removal in a first step then this used calcite p loaded calcite was reutilized for tc removal under different conditions ph phosphate concentration dried state and humid state the results showed that 1 when the initial p concentration was from 30 to 100 mg l 1 the phosphate removal rate was almost above 95 at both ph7 7 and ph 8 3 systems the corresponding ph and calcium results confirmed that the phosphate removal due to precipitation occurred significantly within 24 h 2 the results of ir xps xrd and bet analysis suggested that the precipitated phase on calcite was likely to be amorphous calcium phosphate 3 at both ph7 7 and ph 8 3 systems the removal rate of tc by p loaded calcite was significantly improved compared to that by pure calcite especially with a higher initial p concentration this may be attributed to the adsorption of tc on the precipitated phase of amorphous phosphate calcium which has a larger specific surface area and generates an increasing number of ca sites 4 the similarity of tc removal by p loaded calcite between ph7 7 and ph 8 3 systems allowed us to hypothesize that tc removal may be due to adsorption of tch2 and tch species adsorption on ca sites 5 the slight decreasing trend of tc removal rate in dried experiment compared to humid experiment could result from the small dissolution of precipitated calcium phosphate on calcite our research will serve as reference knowledge for the reutilization of abandoned calcite in phosphate removal which provides a new way to reduce the wasted materials and environmental risks induced by tetracycline however this present study was limited by lack of microscopic data to directly prove precipitated calcium phosphate phase and tc adsorption mechanism on pure calcite or p loaded calcite in future study we envisage to carry out this type of study to elucidate further the adsorption complex of tc on calcite surface

ftir spectra of acnf mno2 indicated the presence of mno2 at peak 548 cm 1 batch adsorption study showed that the optimum ph for maximum adsorption of lead ii was at range 5 0 and isotherm study

those contamination and exposure of lead pb have been reported to be toxic even at its trace amount despite some heavy metals could play crucial role in the biochemical processes in human body system however no studies have reported the benefits of lead exposure to human or environment anthrophogenic sources have been stated to be the main contributor of lead release into water bodies lead is often released from industries mainly from lead battery bearing and recycling lead smelting coal combustion lead containing pipes and leaded paints 2 lead exposure may results to severe neurotoxicity renal dysfunctions as well as causing damages to cardiac vascular hematopoietic system and reproductive system that results to infertility and fetus abnormality concerning about the hazardous effects of lead ii exposure maximum contaminant level mcl of lead in drinking water as set by world health organization and us environmental protection agency usepa is only 10 Î¼g l 3 4 so far many methods have been employed to remove lead from water bodies such as flotation precipitation 5 6 membrane filtration 4 7 8 coagulation flocculation 9 metal leaching 10 and adsorption 11 13 among those the latter technique has been found to be feasible and efficient method to eliminate lead ions from water attributed by wide availability of synthetic or natural adsorbents as well as high recovery of adsorbents 14 conventionally carbonaceous materials in various forms powder granular fibers and tubes have been used as excellent adsorbents for removing diverse harmful and toxic compounds from the environment the adsorptive capacity of these carbonaceous materials can be further improved by making them to be in nano scale where higher specific surface area can be obtained recently activated carbon in nanofiber form acnfs has attracts a very great attention to be utilized as another superior adsorbent ascribed by their excellent adsorption capacity attributed to the uniform pore size

nanofibers 16 17 among all electrospinning has been widely employed for production of functional nanofibers nfs ascribed by its proven simple and effective technique to prepare acnfs via electrospinning process polyacrylonitrile pan is often used as carbon precursor due to its high carbon content and yield 18 to improve the physicochemical properties of the electrospun acnfs incorporating additives in the spinning dope can be as an excellent option modifiers and additives such as different types of metal oxides 19 20 monomers 21 and amino compounds 1 22 are commonly implied during preparing composites nanofibers among those mentioned previously embedding different types of metal oxides such as titanium oxide aluminium oxide and manganese oxide into activated carbon nanofiber are the most convenient practice that can enhance the adsorption efficacies of carbonaceous materials for this case the embedded metal oxides serve as catalyst that accelerates the activation process eventually creates higher pore volume and thus increasing the specific surface area for an instance lee et al 23 reported that adsorptive performance of mn3o4 coated activated carbon for pb2 59 52 mg g and cu2 37 04 mg g were several times higher than the non coated activated carbon on the other hand study by fan et al reported a higher adsorption capacity of cu and cd for granular activated carbon doped with mn oxide 24 doping the ac resulted to higher adsorption capacities caused by enhanced electrostatic attraction and reduced resistance of pb2 onto activated carbon nevertheless the previous studies only focus on making composites using micro size granular activated carbon it is expected that preparation of composite activated carbon in nano scale will results to adsorbent with higher surface area to volume ratio in which required adsorbent dosage can be reduced and at the same time surface reactivity and adsorption kinetics are favoured thus this study aims to incorporate mno2 nanoparticles into acnfs called acnfs mno2 hereafter for the removal of lead ii ions wherein acnfs were prepared by carbonization and activation of electrospun pan nfs it is expected that incorporation of mno2 may enhance the adsorption capacity of acnfs towards lead ii to the best of our knowledge there are no studies have been conducted on incorporating mno2 into acnfs for the removal of heavy metals from water wastewater hence this work offers findings for another potential alternative adsorbent for the sequestration of lead from water streams 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials polyacrylonitrile pan molecular weight 150 kda purchased from sigma aldrich usa and n n dimethylformamide dmf purchased from acros organic usa served as carbon precursor polymer and solvent respectively manganese vi oxide mno2 nanoparticles with 99 purity purchased from sigma aldrich usa was used as additive during the preparation of nanocomposite acnfs aqueous lead ii ions was prepared by using stock solution of lead nitrate salt pb no3 2 purchased from sigma aldrich usa and 0 01 mol l of hcl and naoh solutions were used to adjust the ph of lead ii solution 2 2 preparation of pan mno2 nanofiber mats by electrospinning process dope solution of pan mno2 was firstly prepared by dispersing 2 wt of mno2 nanoparticles based on total weight solid in dmf for 1 h 10 wt of pan powder was later added and the mixture was stirred for 5 h at room temperature on mechanical stirring plate to ensure homogenous suspension subsequently the suspension was subjected to electrospinning process by firstly loaded 10 ml of polymer solution in a syringe and a needle tip was attached to the syringe the syringe was placed horizontally on a syringe pump and an electrode of high voltage supply was clamped to the needle tip during the process the distance of needle tip to the collector was kept constant to be 15 cm while electric voltage of 15 kv was supplied at flow rate of 1 5 ml h the electrospinning process was performed in a closed chamber with relative humidity of approximately 45 50 nanofiber mats were collected after 8 h and allowed to dry for at least a day prior of carbonization and activation process herein the nanofibrous mats was denoted as nfs for pristine nanofiber and nfs mno2 for the nanocomposite nanofiber mats 2 3 carbonization and activation of nf mno2 mats the carbonization and activation of the electrospun nanofiber mats were conducted by following the procedures described by 25 26 initially the nanofiber mats were firstly stabilized at 280 c in air with heating rate of 2 c min after that carbonization in nitrogen gas was carried at 600 c at heating rate of 5 c min for 1 h lastly activation process was carried out by heating the nanofiber mats in carbon dioxide gas at 800 c for 3 h at this point the pristine and composite nanofiber mats were denoted as neat acnfs and acnfs mno2 respectively fig 1 portrays the schematic procedures of fabricating acnf mno2 2 4 physicochemical characterizations the pore structure and specific surface area ssa of both neat acnfs and acnfs mno2 were determined by bet model micromeritics asap 2000 prior to the adsorption test all samples 0 10 g were degassed for at least 3 h at 350 c nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms up to the relative pressure p po of 0 99 with intervals of 0 01 to 0 05 were used to determine the total pore volume and specific surface area the structural morphologies of the neat acnfs and acnfs mno2 were examined by using scanning electron microscopy sem model tm 3000 hitachi and edx analysis to prevent charging reducing thermal damages and improving electron signal during sem examination all samples were sputter coated with platinum for 40 s the functional groups of the prepared nanocomposite nanofibers were examined by atr ftir spectrometer irtrace100 shimadzu with single reflectance atr accessory irtracer100 each sample underwent a total of 600 scans with scanning resolution of 0 25 cm 1and wavelength ranging from 500 cm 1 to 4000 cm 1 xrd analysis was used to identify and characterize the crystalline structure based on their diffraction pattern in this method neat acnfs or acnfs mno2 samples was placed in a holder and illuminated with x rays of a fixed wavelength at Î» 1 514 the graphitization degree of the prepared acnfs was determined by raman spectra analysis using ft raman spectroscope rfs 100 bruker germany at wavelength range from 100 2000 cm 1 2 5 adsorption study of lead ii as the preliminary test simple comparative study of the removal of lead ii from aqueous solution by electrospun acnfs mno2 neat acnfs and commercial granular activated carbon gac was conducted in this study the dosage of adsorbent was set to be 1 g l for this purpose 0 015 g of the sample was added as adsorbent to 15 ml of lead ii solution at initial concentration of 30 mg l in addition effects of different ph and lead ii initial concentration were also conducted to understand the behaviour of adsorption as most studies have reported that the lead adsorption reached the equilibrium within 24 h thus to ensure that adsorption equilibrium is reached the solution was agitated for 48 h at room temperature on the rotary shaker with shaking strength of 150 rpm the final concentration of lead ii was determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy aas and the adsorptive removal of lead was analysed using the following equation 1 removal efficiency co ce co x 100 where co and ce are the initial concentration and final concentration at equilibrium mg l of lead ii accordingly the amount of lead ii adsorbed per unit gram of the acnfs mno2 at equilibrium qe mg g was calculated using the following equation 2 qe co ce v mm where v is the total volume l of lead ii solution while mm is the mass of adsorbent used 2 6 desorption of acnfs mno2 to investigate the desorption capability of acnfs mno2 the used acnfs mno2 onto which lead ii ions was adsorbed were initially rinsed with distilled water after that the samples were immersed in 15 ml of 1 m hcl solution followed by agitation at 100 rpm on rotary shaker for 1 h aas was used to measure the concentration of lead ii in hcl solution and the mass of desorbed ions was calculated as concentration of lead ii times volume of hcl solution the desorption ratio d was calculated by 3 d mass of metal desorbed mg mass of metal ion adsorbed to acnfs mno2 x 100 3 results and discussions 3 1 characterizations of neat acnfs and acnfs mno2 3 1 1 specific surface area fig 2 displays the specific surface area ssa of neat acnfs and acnfs mno2 before and after activation process it can be observed that activation process of increased the ssa up to 52 3 times and 79 7 times for neat acnfs and acnfs mno2 respectively these results can be explained due to the removal of large amount of volatile compounds resulting to the production of new micropores it is also evident that incorporation of mno2 increased the ssa from 478 2 m2 g neat acnfs to 599 4 m2 g acnfs mno2 in addition higher micropore volume 0 285 cm3 g and total pore volume 0 299 cm3 g were observed on acnf mno2 as compared to the neat acnfs these findings can be explained due to the catalytic function of mno2 that accelerates the carbonization process forming additional pore channels and thus increased the amount of pore volume in addition most of the pore size of acnfs mno2 are micropores which favors the adsorption of lead ions the higher total pore volume and ssa is crucial for better adsorption of lead ions within the adsorbent 3 1 2 chemical structure the ftir spectra of nfs mno2 and acnfs mno2 are show in fig 3 based on the spectra the peaks representing nitrile groups cn and methylene group ch2 disappeared after carbonization and activation process the peaks of acnfs mno2 at 1097 5 cm 1 1813 5 cm 1 2098 5 cm 1 and 2326 15 cm 1 indicated the presence of co strong stretching co strong stretching cc variable cc groups variable respectively after activation process in addition the presence of mno2 in both nfs mno2 and acnf mno2 was identified at peak 548 5 cm 1 representing mno group 3 1 3 xrd analysis fig 4 shows the xrd spectra of neat acnfs and acnfs mno2 two broad peaks can be observed at 15 1 and 33 25 for both neat acnfs and acnfs mno2 representing partially disordered graphitic 002 plane graphitic carbon layers and 10 plane carbon atoms respectively 26 3 1 4 raman spectra analysis fig 5 a and b shows the raman spectra of neat acnfs and acnfs mno2 respectively it can be seen that two broad peaks at 1360 cm 1 and 1600 cm 1 were detected revealed as d line and g line respectively typically d line represents the disordered structure and defects of carbon while g line represents the ordered graphitic crystallites associated with sp2 carbons based on the raman spectra the presence of these two peaks confirms the conclusion obtained from the xrd spectra that both neat acnfs and acnfs mno2 consist of an amorphous structure with partially graphitized layers it can be said that the neat acnfs and acnfs mno2 produced in this study revealed graphitic ordering to some extent however the degree of ordering is still quite low as compared to the previous research on the atomic scale ordering of acnfs 3 1 5 morphological structure fig 6 exhibits the sem images of neat acnfs and acnfs mno2 it can be observed that the nanofibers in neat acnfs are straighter while acnfs mno2 are bent and more compactly packed acnfs mno2 s diameter 433 7 nm is smaller than neat acnfs 669 0 nm mno2 nanoparticles seen to be dispersed as beads at the outer surface of acnfs mno2 fig 6 bi these images are in agreement with those of zhang et al 27 this observation was further supported by eds mapping as depicted in fig 7 it is presumed that during electrospinning process polymeric pan solution was ejected first followed by sputtering of mno2 particles due to jet instability resulting to dispersion of mno2 nanoparticles alongside acnfs fibers 18 nevertheless eds mapping analysis indicated the dispersion of mno2 is rather homogenous despite the formation of mno2 contained beads alongside the nanofibers 3 2 lead ii removal from aqueous solution 3 2 1 preliminary comparative study of gac neat acnfs and acnfs mno2 preliminary comparison of the efficiency of lead ii removal was made between conventional gac neat acnfs and acnfs mno2 and the results are displayed in fig 8 the conventional gac used in this study is generally commercial granular activated carbon with specific surface area of 580 m2 g interestingly both acnfs showed complete removal of lead ii while removal efficiency of gac was slightly less demonstrating the potential of acnfs as the adsorbent for heavy metals sequestration 3 2 2 effect of ph the removal of lead ii by acnfs mno2 was further investigated at different ph 1 0 5 0 and the results shown in fig 9 the test was not conducted at higher ph range ph 5 0 due to formation lead hydroxides which causes inaccuracy of data analysis 28 referring to the figure low removal efficiency was observed at the acidic condition increasing of the ph progressively enhanced the removal efficiency from 3 4 ph 1 0 to 94 ph 5 0 thus the optimum ph for this study was identified to be ph 5 0 from the trend shown in the figure it is evident that removal of lead ii is strongly related to ph that influence the protonation of related functional groups that present in acnfs mno2 29 30 briefly at lower ph in acidic condition the competition between h and metal ions for active adsorption sites occurs resulting to low adsorption of lead ions 31 in addition as manganese oxides is reported to have negative surface charge thus as the ph increased to 5 0 there were fewer protonated active sites leaving more negatively charged active sites available for electrostatic interaction between surface of adsorbent and positive metal ions 3 2 3 effect of different lead ii initial concentration the removal efficiency of lead ii by acnfs mno2 at different initial concentrations 10 200 mg l is depicted in fig 10 based on the figure it can be observed that the removal efficiency decreased when initial concentration of lead ii increased meanwhile the adsorption capacity the same as qe obtained by eq 2 increases with initial lead ii concentration from this study the higher adsorption capacity achieved to adsorb lead ii was 120 3 mg g further increment of metal uptake was not observed owing to the saturated binding sites of the adsorbent 30 for the adsorption process higher ssa and pore volume facilitate the adsorption process due to the availability of more binding sites the satisfactory adsorption of lead ii ions achieved in this study is ascribed to the high ssa and pore volume of the acnfs mno2 another possible reason is the presence of mno2 itself that has higher affinity towards metallic ions and thus assisting the adsorption process 32 3 2 4 adsorption isotherm in order to evaluate the adsorption mechanism the langmuir freundlich and temkin isotherm models were applied the linear equations of langmuir freundlich and temkin models are given by eqs 4 6 respectively 4 c e q e 1 q m a x b c e q m a x where qmax is the maximum adsorption capacity mg g and b is related to binding energy of the adsorption system 5 l g l o g q e l o g k f 1 n l o g c e where kf is the freundlich constant mg g mg l 1 n and 1 n is the heterogeneity parameter corresponding to the adsorption intensity 6 qe b1ln kt b1 ln ce where b1 rt b t is the absolute temperature in kelvin r is the universal gas constant 8 314 j mol k kt is the equilibrium binding constant l mg and b1 is related to heat of adsorption the linear plots according to the langmuir freundlich and temkin model are shown in fig 11 while the related parameter values are tabulated in table 1 as seen from table 1 the r2 value from the freundlich model 0 9992 is higher than the temkin model 0 9301 and langmuir model 0 7677 thus the freundlich isotherm model is better fitted to the experimental adsorption data dissimilar to langmuir s adsorption which is based on the chemisorption at a specific homogenous surface with a finite number of identical sites 33 34 freundlich model suggests that the adsorption occurs on a heterogenous surface the value n 1 indicates the favorability of adsorption on the surface of acnfs mno2 35 in this work the n value is 2 78 which may be due to the distribution of surface sites and the increment of surface density that decrease the interaction of adsorbate adsorbent according to the model the maximum adsorption capacity of acnfs mno2 is 120 3 mg g table 1 which is among the highest adsorbents studied table 2 showing its great affinity to heavy metal ions the possible adsorption mechanism is as follows 1 there are two kinds of adsorption sites one the oxygen containing functional groups on the carbonaceous surface that allow complexation with lead ii 2 as manganese oxides is reported to have negative surface charge and thus the enhancement of lead ii adsorption may be attributed to higher negative surface charge of the prepared nanocomposite material that allow electrostatic interaction with pb2 when they are negatively charged at higher ph 23 these adsorption sites are distributed on the nanofiber surface and inside the micropores even though they are not detected by the sem images fig 6 and edx mapping fig 7 since they are hidden inside the pores the monolayer adsorption occurs initially both at the nanofiber surface and at the pore wall the large specific surface area definitely contributes to the enhancement of the monolayer adsorption then the pore is gradually filled as the multilayer adsorption takes place the proposed mechanism is illustrated in fig 12 3 2 5 desorption study for this study we performed 1 time adsorption desorption cycle to evaluate the regeneration of the prepared nanocomposite acnfs from the desorption study it was found that the desorption rate of acnfs mno2 is not significantly different to neat acnfs the desorption ratio of acnfs mno2 is approximately 95 while neat acnfs of 96 as a carbon based materials the nanocomposite material can withstand to up to a standard adsorption desorption cycles of carbon based material as adsorbent and thus this exhibits its potential as another promising adsorbent for heavy metal adsorption 4 conclusion this study reports the fabrication of activated carbon nanofibers with mno2 incorporation acnfs mno2 for the removal of lead ii ions from the aqueous solution by adsorption acnfs mno2 showed better adsorption capacity for lead ii as compared to the commercial granular activated carbon the specific surface area pore size and total pore volume were all increased by incorporation of mno2 to acnfs attributed by the role of mno2 as the catalyst for micropore formation as well the sem images showed that the structure of acnfs mno2 is more compact with fibers of smaller diameters onto which mno2 beads are dispersed adsorption study with aqueous lead ii solutions demonstrated that the adsorption capacity was highly dependent on ph furthermore the adsorption isotherm was better fitted by the freundlich model with a maximum experimental lead uptake of 120 3 mg g on the heterogeneous surface of acnfs mno2 the high adsorption capacity and desorption ratio obtained in this study indicate the potential of acnfs mno2 as adsorbent for removing target heavy metals

prior of carbonization and activation process herein the nanofibrous mats was denoted as nfs for pristine nanofiber and nfs mno2 for the nanocomposite nanofiber mats 2 3 carbonization and activation of nf mno2 mats the carbonization and activation of the electrospun nanofiber mats were conducted by following the procedures described by 25 26 initially the nanofiber mats were firstly stabilized at 280 c in air with heating rate of 2 c min after that carbonization in nitrogen gas was carried at 600 c at heating rate of 5 c min for 1 h lastly activation process was carried out by heating the nanofiber mats in carbon dioxide gas at 800 c for 3 h at this point the pristine and composite nanofiber mats were denoted as neat acnfs and acnfs mno2 respectively fig 1 portrays the schematic procedures of fabricating acnf mno2 2 4 physicochemical characterizations the pore structure and specific surface area ssa of both neat acnfs and acnfs mno2 were determined by bet model micromeritics asap 2000 prior to the adsorption test all samples 0 10 g were degassed for at least 3 h at 350 c nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms up to the relative pressure p po of 0 99 with intervals of 0 01 to 0 05 were used to determine the total pore volume and specific surface area the structural morphologies of the neat acnfs and acnfs mno2 were examined by using scanning electron microscopy sem model tm 3000 hitachi and edx analysis to prevent charging reducing thermal damages and improving electron signal during sem examination all samples were sputter coated with platinum for 40 s the functional groups of the prepared nanocomposite nanofibers were examined by atr ftir spectrometer irtrace100 shimadzu with single reflectance atr accessory irtracer100 each sample underwent a total of 600 scans with scanning resolution of 0 25 cm 1and wavelength ranging from 500 cm 1 to 4000 cm 1 xrd analysis was used to identify and characterize the crystalline structure based on their diffraction pattern in this method neat acnfs or acnfs mno2 samples was placed in a holder and illuminated with x rays of a fixed wavelength at Î» 1 514 the graphitization degree of the prepared acnfs was determined by raman spectra analysis using ft raman spectroscope rfs 100 bruker germany at wavelength range from 100 2000 cm 1 2 5 adsorption study of lead ii as the preliminary test simple comparative study of the removal of lead ii from aqueous solution by electrospun acnfs mno2 neat acnfs and commercial granular activated carbon gac was conducted in this study the dosage of adsorbent was set to be 1 g l for this purpose 0 015 g of the sample was added as adsorbent to 15 ml of lead ii solution at initial concentration of 30 mg l in addition effects of different ph and lead ii initial concentration were also conducted to understand the behaviour of adsorption as most studies have reported that the lead adsorption reached the equilibrium within 24 h thus to ensure that adsorption equilibrium is reached the solution was agitated for 48 h at room temperature on the rotary shaker with shaking strength of 150 rpm the final concentration of lead ii was determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy aas and the adsorptive removal of lead was analysed using the following equation 1 removal efficiency co ce co x 100 where co and ce are the initial concentration and final concentration at equilibrium mg l of lead ii accordingly the amount of lead ii adsorbed per unit gram of the acnfs mno2 at equilibrium qe mg g was calculated using the following equation 2 qe co ce v mm where v is the total volume l of lead ii solution while mm is the mass of adsorbent used 2 6 desorption of acnfs mno2 to investigate the desorption capability of acnfs mno2 the used acnfs mno2 onto which lead ii ions was adsorbed were initially rinsed with distilled water after that the samples were immersed in 15 ml of 1 m hcl solution followed by agitation at 100 rpm on rotary shaker for 1 h aas was used to measure the concentration of lead ii in hcl solution and the mass of desorbed ions was calculated as concentration of lead ii times volume of hcl solution the desorption ratio d was calculated by 3 d mass of metal desorbed mg mass of metal ion adsorbed to acnfs mno2 x 100 3 results and discussions 3 1 characterizations of neat acnfs and acnfs mno2 3 1 1 specific surface area fig 2 displays the specific surface area ssa of neat acnfs and acnfs mno2 before and after activation process it can be observed that activation process of increased the ssa up to 52 3 times and 79 7 times for neat acnfs and acnfs mno2 respectively these results can be explained due to the removal of large amount of volatile compounds resulting to the production of new micropores it is also evident that incorporation of mno2 increased the ssa from 478 2 m2 g neat acnfs to 599 4 m2 g acnfs mno2 in addition higher micropore volume 0 285 cm3 g and total pore volume 0 299 cm3 g were observed on acnf mno2 as compared to the neat acnfs these findings can be explained due to the catalytic function of mno2 that accelerates the carbonization process forming additional pore channels and thus increased the amount of pore volume in addition most of the pore size of acnfs mno2 are micropores which favors the adsorption of lead ions the higher total pore volume and ssa is crucial for better adsorption of lead ions within the adsorbent 3 1 2 chemical structure the ftir spectra of nfs mno2 and acnfs mno2 are show in fig 3 based on the spectra the peaks representing nitrile groups cn and methylene group ch2 disappeared after carbonization and activation process the peaks of acnfs mno2 at 1097 5 cm 1 1813 5 cm 1 2098 5 cm 1 and 2326 15 cm 1 indicated the presence of co strong stretching co strong stretching cc variable cc groups variable respectively after activation process in addition the presence of mno2 in both nfs mno2 and acnf mno2 was identified at peak 548 5 cm 1 representing mno group 3 1 3 xrd analysis fig 4 shows the xrd spectra of neat acnfs and acnfs mno2 two broad peaks can be observed at 15 1 and 33 25 for both neat acnfs and acnfs mno2 representing partially disordered graphitic 002 plane graphitic carbon layers and 10 plane carbon atoms respectively 26 3 1 4 raman spectra analysis fig 5 a and b shows the raman spectra of neat acnfs and acnfs mno2 respectively it can be seen that two broad peaks at 1360 cm 1 and 1600 cm 1 were detected revealed as d line and g line respectively typically d line represents the disordered structure and defects of carbon while g line represents the ordered graphitic crystallites associated with sp2 carbons based on the raman spectra the presence of these two peaks confirms the conclusion obtained from the xrd spectra that both neat acnfs and acnfs mno2 consist of an amorphous structure with partially graphitized layers it can be said that the neat acnfs and acnfs mno2 produced in this study revealed graphitic ordering to some extent however the degree of ordering is still quite low as compared to the previous research on the atomic scale ordering of acnfs 3 1 5 morphological structure fig 6 exhibits the sem images of neat acnfs and acnfs mno2 it can be observed that the nanofibers in neat acnfs are straighter while acnfs mno2 are bent and more compactly packed acnfs mno2 s diameter 433 7 nm is smaller than neat acnfs 669 0 nm mno2 nanoparticles seen to be dispersed as beads at the outer surface of acnfs mno2 fig 6 bi these images are in agreement with those of zhang et al 27 this observation was further supported by eds mapping as depicted in fig 7 it is presumed that during electrospinning process polymeric pan solution was ejected first followed by sputtering of mno2 particles due to jet instability resulting to dispersion of mno2 nanoparticles alongside acnfs fibers 18 nevertheless eds mapping analysis indicated the dispersion of mno2 is rather homogenous despite the formation of mno2 contained beads alongside the nanofibers 3 2 lead ii removal from aqueous solution 3 2 1 preliminary comparative study of gac neat acnfs and acnfs mno2 preliminary comparison of the efficiency of lead ii removal was made between conventional gac neat acnfs and acnfs mno2 and the results are displayed in fig 8 the conventional gac used in this study is generally commercial granular activated carbon with specific surface area of 580 m2 g interestingly both acnfs showed complete removal of lead ii while removal efficiency of gac was slightly less demonstrating the potential of acnfs as the adsorbent for heavy metals sequestration 3 2 2 effect of ph the removal of lead ii by acnfs mno2 was further investigated at different ph 1 0 5 0 and the results shown in fig 9 the test was not conducted at higher ph range ph 5 0 due to formation lead hydroxides which causes inaccuracy of data analysis 28 referring to the figure low removal efficiency was observed at the acidic condition increasing of the ph progressively enhanced the removal efficiency from 3 4 ph 1 0 to 94 ph 5 0 thus the optimum ph for this study was identified to be ph 5 0 from the trend shown in the figure it is evident that removal of lead ii is strongly related to ph that influence the protonation of related functional groups that present in acnfs mno2 29 30 briefly at lower ph in acidic condition the competition between h and metal ions for active adsorption sites occurs resulting to low adsorption of lead ions 31 in addition as manganese oxides is reported to have negative surface charge thus as the ph increased to 5 0 there were fewer protonated active sites leaving more negatively charged active sites available for electrostatic interaction between surface of adsorbent and positive metal ions 3 2 3 effect of different lead ii initial concentration the removal efficiency of lead ii by acnfs mno2 at different initial concentrations 10 200 mg l is depicted in fig 10 based on the figure it can be observed that the removal efficiency decreased when initial concentration of lead ii increased meanwhile the adsorption capacity the same as qe obtained by eq 2 increases with initial lead ii concentration from this study the higher adsorption capacity achieved to adsorb lead ii was 120 3 mg g further increment of metal uptake was not observed owing to the saturated binding sites of the adsorbent 30 for the adsorption process higher ssa and pore volume facilitate the adsorption process due to the availability of more binding sites the satisfactory adsorption of lead ii ions achieved in this study is ascribed to the high ssa and pore volume of the acnfs mno2 another possible reason is the presence of mno2 itself that has higher affinity towards metallic ions and thus assisting the adsorption process 32 3 2 4 adsorption isotherm in order to evaluate the adsorption mechanism the langmuir freundlich and temkin isotherm models were applied the linear equations of langmuir freundlich and temkin models are given by eqs 4 6 respectively 4 c e q e 1 q m a x b c e q m a x where qmax is the maximum adsorption capacity mg g and b is related to binding energy of the adsorption system 5 l g l o g q e l o g k f 1 n l o g c e where kf is the freundlich constant mg g mg l 1 n and 1 n is the heterogeneity parameter corresponding to the adsorption intensity 6 qe b1ln kt b1 ln ce where b1 rt b t is the absolute temperature in kelvin r is the universal gas constant 8 314 j mol k kt is the equilibrium binding constant l mg and b1 is related to heat of adsorption the linear plots according to the langmuir freundlich and temkin model are shown in fig 11 while the related parameter values are tabulated in table 1 as seen from table 1 the r2 value from the freundlich model 0 9992 is higher than the temkin model 0 9301 and langmuir model 0 7677 thus the freundlich isotherm model is better fitted to the experimental adsorption data dissimilar to langmuir s adsorption which is based on the chemisorption at a specific homogenous surface with a finite number of identical sites 33 34 freundlich model suggests that the adsorption occurs on a heterogenous surface the value n 1 indicates the favorability of adsorption on the surface of acnfs mno2 35 in this work the n value is 2 78 which may be due to the distribution of surface sites and the increment of surface density that decrease the interaction of adsorbate adsorbent according to the model the maximum adsorption capacity of acnfs mno2 is 120 3 mg g table 1 which is among the highest adsorbents studied table 2 showing its great affinity to heavy metal ions the possible adsorption mechanism is as follows 1 there are two kinds of adsorption sites one the oxygen containing functional groups on the carbonaceous surface that allow complexation with lead ii 2 as manganese oxides is reported to have negative surface charge and thus the enhancement of lead ii adsorption may be attributed to higher negative surface charge of the prepared nanocomposite material that allow electrostatic interaction with pb2 when they are negatively charged at higher ph 23 these adsorption sites are distributed on the nanofiber surface and inside the micropores even though they are not detected by the sem images fig 6 and edx mapping fig 7 since they are hidden inside the pores the monolayer adsorption occurs initially both at the nanofiber surface and at the pore wall the large specific surface area definitely contributes to the enhancement of the monolayer adsorption then the pore is gradually filled as the multilayer adsorption takes place the proposed mechanism is illustrated in fig 12 3 2 5 desorption study for this study we performed 1 time adsorption desorption cycle to evaluate the regeneration of the prepared nanocomposite acnfs from the desorption study it was found that the desorption rate of acnfs mno2 is not significantly different to neat acnfs the desorption ratio of acnfs mno2 is approximately 95 while neat acnfs of 96 as a carbon based materials the nanocomposite material can withstand to up to a standard adsorption desorption cycles of carbon based material as adsorbent and thus this exhibits its potential as another promising adsorbent for heavy metal adsorption 4 conclusion this study reports the fabrication of activated carbon nanofibers with mno2 incorporation acnfs mno2 for the removal of lead ii ions from the aqueous solution by adsorption acnfs mno2 showed better adsorption capacity for lead ii as compared to the commercial granular activated carbon the specific surface area pore size and total pore volume were all increased by incorporation of mno2 to acnfs attributed by the role of mno2 as the catalyst for micropore formation as well the sem images showed that the structure of acnfs mno2 is more compact with fibers of smaller diameters onto which mno2 beads are dispersed adsorption study with aqueous lead ii solutions demonstrated that the adsorption capacity was highly dependent on ph furthermore the adsorption isotherm was better fitted by the freundlich model with a maximum experimental lead uptake of 120 3 mg g on the heterogeneous surface of acnfs mno2 the high adsorption capacity and desorption ratio obtained in this study indicate the potential of acnfs mno2 as adsorbent for removing target heavy metals

13877,this work is an exploratory study about the application of aqueous phase reforming apr in the treatment of sanitary sewage for reuse purposes the removal of organic matter in terms of toc the elimination of micro pollutants caffeine carbamazepine diclofenac and ibuprofen and the production of hydrogen and alkanes were evaluated batch reactors were employed for the treatment of synthetic sewage using a pt catalyst supported on a commercial carbon black apr was found to be suitable to remove toc and micro pollutants from sewage total removal was achieved for carbamazepine and diclofenac whereas for caffeine and ibuprofen the removal levels exceeded 90 removal of toc was also observed in tests where only the metal free carbon support was used most probably due to adsorption and hydrothermal carbonization which could be considered as a route for organic matter removal although low production of valuable gases was observed in the catalysed experiment in addition to toc removal significant production of h2 and ch4 was achieved the application of apr to wastewater makes possible to remove pollutants and micro pollutants and simultaneously valorize organic matter to valuable gases keywords water phase reforming sewage treatment micro pollutants reuse 1 introduction project planning for wastewater treatment and reuse is increasing 1 with types of reuse ranging from irrigation water production to industrial uses and human consumption in some countries it is already a common practice as in spain where more than 500 mm3 year of treated wastewater is reused 2 and israel where more than 80 of treated wastewater is reused in singapore the sanitation company meets up to 30 of the country s current water needs 3 which may increase to 55 by 2060 4 water reuse in agriculture is the most common case whereas reuse for drinking has been employed in many countries 5 sewage treatment plants have technologies capable of removing organic matter nutrients and a wide range of pathogenic organisms however the presence of micro pollutants in the effluents is still a problem being often found pesticides endocrine disrupters 6 pharmaceutical molecules such as painkillers antibiotics beta blockers anticonvulsants lipid regulators contrast agents anticancer agents hormones disinfectants etc 7 among these ibuprofen diclofenac carbamazepine and caffeine are frequently found in wastewater and therefore commonly used in case studies on micro pollutants removal technologies an additional arising concern is complete removal of pathogens and antibiotic resistance genes 8 ibuprofen is among the most commonly prescribed drugs 9 10 this compound has been widely used in global health services 11 diclofenac dcf is also among the most commonly used and after oral administration between 60 and 70 of the dose is excreted in urine and 20 30 in faeces as the original drug or as metabolites 12 carbamazepine cbz is resistant to biodegradation and therefore highly recalcitrant in biological wastewater treatment 13 after conventional treatment about 30 of carbamazepine is degraded 14 and the rest is released into recipient water bodies as for caffeine cfn the problem of this contaminant is associated with high consumption since it is one of the most commonly found anthropogenic markers in surface and groundwater although it has high water solubility low accumulation and some wastewater treatment technologies remove about 80 of this contaminant 15 the presence of these compounds in effluents is related to inefficiency of conventional treatment systems in removing them 16 treatment technologies such as activated carbon advanced oxidation membrane bioreactors activated sludge nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro have been employed to remove micro pollutants but generally present operational problems and or do not achieve the efficiency required by regulations to treat effluents containing micro pollutants 16 23 the strategies for the removal of these compounds have found problems associated with the cost or use of critical components which are consumed in the stoichiometric reaction which stimulates the interest in new approaches 20 an alternative to be evaluated and not yet explored in sewage treatment is aqueous phase reforming apr which is a technology capable of converting organic compounds into hydrogen and alkanes 24 25 however the organic compounds usually considered as apr feedstocks could account for more than 90 of the total production costs 26 a new approach is the use of wastewater as feedstock for apr which allows treatment and valorization in the application of apr for the valorization of biomass fractions the operating costs must be compensated by the gases produced therefore the use of concentrated feeds is important of the economy of the process in the application of apr to wastewater there is a higher margin for operating at lower concentration of organic matter because apr is integrated in the waste management scheme energy integration is also one of the challenges in the application of apr due to process temperature requirements which can be addressed thanks to the use of continuous reactors enabling heat recovery for treated waste and combustion of part of the produced gases 26 apr is a catalytic process where a variety of metallic active phases including pt pd ru and ni have been used 27 carbon materials have been considered as suitable supports due their excellent hydrothermal stability and additional advantages in terms of activity stability and regenerability 28 31 the biomass commonly used as raw material in the apr process is generally derived from oxygenated compounds such as alcohols glycerol and sugars 32 33 in the sanitary sewage about 70 of the solids are of organic origin consisting mainly of protein 40 60 and carbohydrate 25 50 compounds 34 therefore the pollutants commonly found in sanitary sewage can be considered as potential raw material for conversion through apr allowing organic load elimination and simultaneous production of gases that can be marketed or used for energy generation in previous works the treatment of industrial wastewaters by apr was reported as a feasible method where cod removals above 99 were achieved under optimum conditions 35 36 the application of apr to sewage can have interesting features in addition to cod removal and valorization since high temperatures can also lead to destruction of pathogens resistance genes etc the current work explores for the first time the application of apr for the treatment of sewage for reuse water production a pt catalyst supported on carbon black has been used for the batch treatment of synthetic sewage the influence of the sanitary sewage composition and ph in catalyst performance removal of organic matter and micro pollutants removal and generation of hydrogen and methane is assessed 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials meat extract starch sucrose 99 5 calcium chloride dehydrates 99 caffeine 99 diclofenac sodium salt 98 5 ibuprofen 98 carbamazepine 99 and hexachloroplatinic acid solution 8 in h2o were purchased from sigma aldrich sodium chloride 99 5 magnesium chloride hexahydrate 99 were supplied by panreac applichem commercial soy oil and detergent were acquired from a local supermarket ensaco 250 g carbon black was supplied by timcal canada inc 2 2 synthetic sewage preparation the synthetic sewage used consisted of water protein carbohydrates lipids and mineral salts 37 38 for a 220 mg l of total organic carbon toc and 1 300 mg l of chemical oxygen demand cod table 1 the ph of sewage was from 6 5 to 8 and was adjusted with koh for the study of micro pollutants removal stock sewage was prepared without mineral salts and soybean oil due to the potential interference of these components in catalyst performance table 2 2 3 catalyst preparation and characterization pt catalysts have proven to be among the most active and selective to hydrogen in apr due to their activity in wgs reaction and ability to cleavage cc bonds 33 39 therefore a pt catalyst supported on mesoporous carbon black was selected for this work in order to secure good and comparable catalytic performance and minimize mass transfer constrains and maximize hydrothermal stability 36 pt catalyst with a representative concentration of 3 wt was synthesized by incipient wetness impregnation method on ensaco 250 g carbon black a commercial standardized hexachloroplatinic acid solution was used as pt precursor thus avoiding deviations in metal content due to the use of highly hygroscopic precursor salt incipient wetness impregnation is commonly used and provide with good matching between nominal and actual metal load 40 minor deviations can be expected from nominal metal concentrations and these can be considered as acceptable for the purpose of the current work after impregnation of the precursor solution the catalyst was dried at 60 c overnight then it was calcined in air at 200 c during 2 h and reduced under 25 n ml min h2 flow at 300 c for 2 h the carbon support and the catalyst were characterized by n2 adsorption desorption at 77 k micromeritics tristar ii and ph slurry measurements specific surface area sbet was determined using the bet model micrographs of the catalyst were obtained using a 300 kv transmission electron microscope jeol 3000 f to examine morphology and size of the active phase imagej 1 44i software was used for counting and measuring pt nanoparticles size in digital tem images 2 4 aqueous phase reforming apr experiments the apr reactions were performed in a batch reactor model br100 manufacturer berghoff for 4 h using 15 ml of sewage and 0 3 g of catalyst the reactor was purged three times with argon before starting the heating and stirring process at a speed of 500 rpm the experiments were performed at 220 c and 24 26 bar the resulting process effluent was filtered through 0 45 Î¼m ptfe filters scharlab and analyzed initial sewage and effluent samples where characterized by toc measured in a toc vcsh apparatus shimadzu and ph 41 organic load removal from sewage was monitored through total organic carbon toc analysis because cod does not reflect properly removal due to the high oxygen content of degradation products formed in the arp reaction route micro pollutants compounds were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography hplc 1200 6410 tq agilent the gases generated in the process were collected in multi layer sample bags supelco and analyzed by a gc fid tcd 7820a agilent allowing detection of h2 co co2 ch4 c2h6 and c3h8 fig 1 h2 and ch4 yield were calculated according to eq 1 and eq 2 respectively 1 y h 2 m m o l g c o d i n i t i a l m m o l h 2 c o d i n i t i a l g 2 y c h 4 m m o l g c o d i n i t i a l m m o l c h 4 c o d i n i t i a l g 3 results and discussion 3 1 catalyst characterization a number of factors including the nature and structure of the active phase and support material 25 governs catalyst performance for this reason these parameters were determined table 3 the ensaco carbon black support presented a specific surface area of 65 m2 g the introduction of the active metal hardly changed the original texture properties of the support a small reduction in support surface area is commonly observed after the introduction of the metal phase due to blockage of pores by metal nanoparticles 42 43 but in the current case this effect was negligible due to low metal load and the mainly mesoporous nature of the pores the ph slurry of the support was 8 9 and only decreased slightly up to 8 6 after the preparation of the catalyst this ph slurry facilitates apr process in terms of activity and selectivity to h2 since the basicity of the support favours wgs reaction and therefore h2 generation 28 44 45 while acidic supports may trigger reactions leading to alkane formation 46 47 the tem micrographs of pt ensaco catalysts revealed globular shape of the pt nanoparticles and good dispersion on the support material with very low occurrence of agglomerations and oversized nanoparticles fig 2 likewise pt nanoparticle size distribution was obtained and an average size of 4 7 nm was calculated with a standard deviation of 2 5 nm 3 2 apr of sewage sewage samples were treated to evaluate the application of apr to the removal of organic matter in terms of toc removal and hydrogen generation experiments with pt ensaco catalyst with metal free carbon black ensaco support and without catalyst or support blank were conducted to decouple adsorption thermal removal and catalytic removal of pollutants the toc removal gas composition total gas produced yh2 and ych4 obtained in these experiments table 4 in the blank assay removal of 28 5 toc occurred which can be attributed to hydrothermal carbonization of the organic matter due to reaction temperature 48 toc removal increased up to 62 1 for the assay with the metal free ensaco support the high removal achieved may be related to enhanced hydrothermal carbonization mediated by the support some contribution of adsorption to removal can be expected although ensaco carbon black has a low surface area 16 31 49 in the apr treatment of sewage catalysed by pt ensaco more than 55 of the initial toc was removed likewise differences in reaction mechanisms and degradation routes can be inferred from the production of gases the main component in all the tests was co2 indicating a contribution of hydrothermal carbonization in all cases and some production of hydrogen and alkanes through this route the absence of co in the gas produced in the catalysed run shows that under the operating conditions used the catalyst promoted additional formation of h2 by the water gas shift wgs reaction this feature was also observed in apr of glycerol with pt based catalysts 39 50 with the nature of the support material affecting h2 production 25 in the apr of sewage catalysed by pt ensaco a lower proportion of h2 was found in the produced gases than for runs with ensaco support alone probably due to consumption in methanation reactions as can be inferred from the high proportion of ch4 51 however the h2 and ch4 yields increased over 2 and 20 times respectively in the experiments carried out with pt ensaco catalyst the percentage of c2h6 and c3h8 in the produced gas was also higher for the pt ensaco catalysed test and in overall the higher selectivity to alkanes resulted in a lower proportion of co2 in the produced gas the yield to h2 in this work is lower than that reported in literature for apr of other substrates as brewery wastewater 0 4 vs 15 4 mmol gcodinitial respectively 36 at equivalent conditions this difference can be ascribed to the higher concentration in brewery wastewater of carbohydrates i e maltose which are more easily reformed than proteins from meat extract and especially to the much lower concentration of chloride in the brewery wastewater responsible for catalyst deactivation apr tests catalysed by pt ensaco were also conducted using sewage with different compositions in order to assess the role of individual organic components inorganic salts and ph as they may influence catalyst performance 25 the toc removal gas composition total gas produced yh2 and ych4 obtained in these experiments are shown in table 5 in the catalysed apr of sewage without salts the removal of toc increased from 55 to 58 which is ascribable to higher activity of the catalyst in the absence of chloride and sodium ions 35 in the case of the experiments conducted with sewage without oil the average toc removal was 67 showing that this component has a major influence in the catalytic performance probably due to adsorption of oil on the hydrophobic regions of the carbon black support and affecting the active sites it can also be observed that in the apr of individual components a remarkable toc removal of 93 3 is achieved in the case of starch whereas 60 5 of initial toc is removed in the case of meat extract toc removal is above 80 for oil and sucrose these results are in agreement with former works where apr was proved to be an efficient treatment for the conversion of carbohydrates to hydrogen although different initial substrates showed different behaviour 27 52 55 a relevant aspect regarding the application of apr is the stability of the catalysts in this sense pt ensaco was tested in a previous work 36 in 5 cycles of use in the apr of brewery wastewater with a cod of 6200 mg l toc removal decreased from 87 to 78 along the cycles therefore a higher of the catalysts can be expected in the case of sewage as the initial cod is significantly lower when apr of sewage without inorganic salts was conducted h2 concentration in the produced gas was significantly higher 21 1 than the average value 4 7 obtained in the reactions with salt containing sewage the presence of nacl in apr catalysed with pt based catalyst was found to be responsible for lower h2 selectivity in previous works due to poisoning of active sites 56 57 regarding the influence of initial ph of sewage the removal of toc increased slightly from 55 3 59 9 when ph increased from 6 5 8 h2 generation tends to increase with ph of the reaction medium 28 39 44 45 as basic conditions lead to high h2 selectivity in apr reactions 27 58 because of this effect when ph increased from 6 5 8 the percentage of h2 in the produced gas increased from 4 7 31 4 and the yield to h2 increased to a relevant value of 3 79 mmol gcodinitial optimization of the treatment and valorisation of sewage may require removal of some components and ph adjustment in particular oil removal is a common practice in treatment schemes the removal of toc achieved in this work can be increased by adjusting the pollutants to metal catalyst ratio since previous works have shown that in complex matrices also including carbohydrates and proteins the removal can be increased to c a 99 36 3 3 removal of micro pollutants by apr of sewage as conventional sewage treatment systems have in general low ability to eliminate micro pollutants the effectiveness of the apr process in removing caffeine carbamazepine diclofenac and ibuprofen was investigated in this study the micro pollutant removal for the blank ensaco support without metallic phase and pt ensaco catalyst table 6 the removal percentages of micro pollutants were 99 3 for caffeine 100 for carbamazepine and diclofenac and 88 9 for ibuprofen in the apr runs catalysed with pt ensaco tests performed with ensaco and pt ensaco showed a high removal of micro pollutants close or equal to 100 in most of the cases showing that both hydrothermal treatment and apr favoured an effective removal of micro pollutants likewise the emerging pollutants were removed in some extent in the case of the blank experiments particularly in the case of carbamazepine and diclofenac indicating that the structure of these compounds favours the hydrothermal carbonization route 59 adsorption may have a contribution to micro pollutants removal in the case of the experiments with ensaco and pt ensaco however only traces of micro pollutants was desorbed from materials after reaction runs when exposed to acetonitrile medium nevertheless adsorption can be expected to have an important role as part of the reaction pathway ensaco and pt ensaco showed different mechanisms to remove micropollutants according to results a first stage of adsorption on catalyst surface can be expected in both cases in the case of ensaco the hydrothermal carbonization htc was the main pathway involving hydrolysis decarboxylation dehydration and polymerization reactions 60 that favoured the formation of solid products and co2 in the case of pt ensaco reforming pathway involving the cleavage of cc and co bonds and water gas shift reaction predominantly favoured the formation of h2 and light alkanes 33 the gas composition total gas produced yh2 and ych4 in the apr of sewage with micro pollutants table 7 the h2 proportion was 1 7 in the experiments without catalyst 4 5 in the experiments with carbon material and 19 2 with pt ensaco catalyst these results show that the use of catalyst favour the removal of micro pollutants regarding the production of gas it increased together with yh2 and ych4 but it must be taken into account that runs were carried out without oil and salts to better trace the fate of micro pollutants 3 4 treated sewage reuse the apr process led to a toc removal of close to 60 table 5 resulting in a final toc of around 130 mg l and a high degree of micro pollutant removal caffeine 99 3 carbamazepine and diclofenac 100 and ibuprofen 99 6 allowed to reach in the apr process in general micropollutants achieve different removal rates for different treatment technologies caffeine removal has been shown to be effective with an efficiency of 100 due to its high degradation capacity 61 64 as for ibuprofen different studies indicate removal rates between 60 99 63 65 68 these two compounds have removal rates similar to those obtained in this study however for carbamazepine and diclofenac the removal achieved has been less than 30 in secondary treatments 69 71 presenting the apr technique removal reached 100 of the concentration what puts this technique in a great advantage in relation to the others considering the possibility of reusing the effluent generated after apr treatment in the industrial sector it can contribute to the increase in the consumption of recycled water in addition to the common uses such as cooling towers boiler feeding and cleaning and proceed to the use of these waters in industrial processes 72 proper management of water consumption can lead to savings of up to 30 in total consumption 3 new technologies capable of removing micro pollutants may support the establishment of minimum quality requirements for these parameters which are still absent or not consolidated in the reference documents for the practice of reuse 4 conclusions the results obtained indicate that the application of apr for the treatment of sanitary sewage has a clear potential for the elimination and valorization of the pollutants of biomass origin and with a view on water reuse toc removal by pt ensaco catalysts reached 55 3 93 3 for the sewage samples tested which can be increased by increasing catalyst load an alternative route to toc degradation by hydrothermal carbonization has also been identified although the catalytic route results in higher production of h2 and alkanes reaching up to 3 79 and 1 38 mmol gcodinitial respectively depending on wastewater composition and ph conditions pre treatment of sewage for oil removal is an interesting option to maximize sewage processability by apr and increase valuable gases production as for the micro pollutants carbamazepine diclofenac ibuprofen and caffeine the removal achieved was between 90 and 100 further assessment and validation work is needed on the optimization of operating conditions to maximize toc removal and elimination of target micro pollutants an additional consideration to be addresses is process energy integration to assess how the valuable gases generated

13877,this work is an exploratory study about the application of aqueous phase reforming apr in the treatment of sanitary sewage for reuse purposes the removal of organic matter in terms of toc the elimination of micro pollutants caffeine carbamazepine diclofenac and ibuprofen and the production of hydrogen and alkanes were evaluated batch reactors were employed for the treatment of synthetic sewage using a pt catalyst supported on a commercial carbon black apr was found to be suitable to remove toc and micro pollutants from sewage total removal was achieved for carbamazepine and diclofenac whereas for caffeine and ibuprofen the removal levels exceeded 90 removal of toc was also observed in tests where only the metal free carbon support was used most probably due to adsorption and hydrothermal carbonization which could be considered as a route for organic matter removal although low production of valuable gases was observed in the catalysed experiment in addition to toc removal significant production of h2 and ch4 was achieved the application of apr to wastewater makes possible to remove pollutants and micro pollutants and simultaneously valorize organic matter to valuable gases keywords water phase reforming sewage treatment micro pollutants reuse 1 introduction project planning for wastewater treatment and reuse is increasing 1 with types of reuse ranging from irrigation water production to industrial uses and human consumption in some countries it is already a common practice as in spain where more than 500 mm3 year of treated wastewater is reused 2 and israel where more than 80 of treated wastewater is reused in singapore the sanitation company meets up to 30 of the country s current water needs 3 which may increase to 55 by 2060 4 water reuse in agriculture is the most common case whereas reuse for drinking has been employed in many countries 5 sewage treatment plants have technologies capable of removing organic matter nutrients and a wide range of pathogenic organisms however the presence of micro pollutants in the effluents is still a problem being often found pesticides endocrine disrupters 6 pharmaceutical molecules such as painkillers antibiotics beta blockers anticonvulsants lipid regulators contrast agents anticancer agents hormones disinfectants etc 7 among these ibuprofen diclofenac carbamazepine and caffeine are frequently found in wastewater and therefore commonly used in case studies on micro pollutants removal technologies an additional arising concern is complete removal of pathogens and antibiotic resistance genes 8 ibuprofen is among the most commonly prescribed drugs 9 10 this compound has been widely used in global health services 11 diclofenac dcf is also among the most commonly used and after oral administration between 60 and 70 of the dose is excreted in urine and 20 30 in faeces as the original drug or as metabolites 12 carbamazepine cbz is resistant to biodegradation and therefore highly recalcitrant in biological wastewater treatment 13 after conventional treatment about 30 of carbamazepine is degraded 14 and the rest is released into recipient water bodies as for caffeine cfn the problem of this contaminant is associated with high consumption since it is one of the most commonly found anthropogenic markers in surface and groundwater although it has high water solubility low accumulation and some wastewater treatment technologies remove about 80 of this contaminant 15 the presence of these compounds in effluents is related to inefficiency of conventional treatment systems in removing them 16 treatment technologies such as activated carbon advanced oxidation membrane bioreactors activated sludge nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro have been employed to remove micro pollutants but generally present operational problems and or do not achieve the efficiency required by regulations to treat effluents containing micro pollutants 16 23 the strategies for the removal of these compounds have found problems associated with the cost or use of critical components which are consumed in the stoichiometric reaction which stimulates the interest in new approaches 20 an alternative to be evaluated and not yet explored in sewage treatment is aqueous phase reforming apr which is a technology capable of converting organic compounds into hydrogen and alkanes 24 25 however the organic compounds usually considered as apr feedstocks could account for more than 90 of the total production costs 26 a new approach is the use of wastewater as feedstock for apr which allows treatment and valorization in the application of apr for the valorization of biomass fractions the operating costs must be compensated by the gases produced therefore the use of concentrated feeds is important of the economy of the process in the application of apr to wastewater there is a higher margin for operating at lower concentration of organic matter because apr is integrated in the waste management scheme energy integration is also one of the challenges in the application of apr due to process temperature requirements which can be addressed thanks to the use of continuous reactors enabling heat recovery for treated waste and combustion of part of the produced gases 26 apr is a catalytic process where a variety of metallic active phases including pt pd ru and ni have been used 27 carbon materials have been considered as suitable supports due their excellent hydrothermal stability and additional advantages in terms of activity stability and regenerability 28 31 the biomass commonly used as raw material in the apr process is generally derived from oxygenated compounds such as alcohols glycerol and sugars 32 33 in the sanitary sewage about 70 of the solids are of organic origin consisting mainly of protein 40 60 and carbohydrate 25 50 compounds 34 therefore the pollutants commonly found in sanitary sewage can be considered as potential raw material for conversion through apr allowing organic load elimination and simultaneous production of gases that can be marketed or used for energy generation in previous works the treatment of industrial wastewaters by apr was reported as a feasible method where cod removals above 99 were achieved under optimum conditions 35 36 the application of apr to sewage can have interesting features in addition to cod removal and valorization since high temperatures can also lead to destruction of pathogens resistance genes etc the current work explores for the first time the application of apr for the treatment of sewage for reuse water production a pt catalyst supported on carbon black has been used for the batch treatment of synthetic sewage the influence of the sanitary sewage composition and ph in catalyst performance removal of organic matter and micro pollutants removal and generation of hydrogen and methane is assessed 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials meat extract starch sucrose 99 5 calcium chloride dehydrates 99 caffeine 99 diclofenac sodium salt 98 5 ibuprofen 98 carbamazepine 99 and hexachloroplatinic acid solution 8 in h2o were purchased from sigma aldrich sodium chloride 99 5 magnesium chloride hexahydrate 99 were supplied by panreac applichem commercial soy oil and detergent were acquired from a local supermarket ensaco 250 g carbon black was supplied by timcal canada inc 2 2 synthetic sewage preparation the synthetic sewage used consisted of water protein carbohydrates lipids and mineral salts 37 38 for a 220 mg l of total organic carbon toc and 1 300 mg l of chemical oxygen demand cod table 1 the ph of sewage was from 6 5 to 8 and was adjusted with koh for the study of micro pollutants removal stock sewage was prepared without mineral salts and soybean oil due to the potential interference of these components in catalyst performance table 2 2 3 catalyst preparation and characterization pt catalysts have proven to be among the most active and selective to hydrogen in apr due to their activity in wgs reaction and ability to cleavage cc bonds 33 39 therefore a pt catalyst supported on mesoporous carbon black was selected for this work in order to secure good and comparable catalytic performance and minimize mass transfer constrains and maximize hydrothermal stability 36 pt catalyst with a representative concentration of 3 wt was synthesized by incipient wetness impregnation method on ensaco 250 g carbon black a commercial standardized hexachloroplatinic acid solution was used as pt precursor thus avoiding deviations in metal content due to the use of highly hygroscopic precursor salt incipient wetness impregnation is commonly used and provide with good matching between nominal and actual metal load 40 minor deviations can be expected from nominal metal concentrations and these can be considered as acceptable for the purpose of the current work after impregnation of the precursor solution the catalyst was dried at 60 c overnight then it was calcined in air at 200 c during 2 h and reduced under 25 n ml min h2 flow at 300 c for 2 h the carbon support and the catalyst were characterized by n2 adsorption desorption at 77 k micromeritics tristar ii and ph slurry measurements specific surface area sbet was determined using the bet model micrographs of the catalyst were obtained using a 300 kv transmission electron microscope jeol 3000 f to examine morphology and size of the active phase imagej 1 44i software was used for counting and measuring pt nanoparticles size in digital tem images 2 4 aqueous phase reforming apr experiments the apr reactions were performed in a batch reactor model br100 manufacturer berghoff for 4 h using 15 ml of sewage and 0 3 g of catalyst the reactor was purged three times with argon before starting the heating and stirring process at a speed of 500 rpm the experiments were performed at 220 c and 24 26 bar the resulting process effluent was filtered through 0 45 Î¼m ptfe filters scharlab and analyzed initial sewage and effluent samples where characterized by toc measured in a toc vcsh apparatus shimadzu and ph 41 organic load removal from sewage was monitored through total organic carbon toc analysis because cod does not reflect properly removal due to the high oxygen content of degradation products formed in the arp reaction route micro pollutants compounds were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography hplc 1200 6410 tq agilent the gases generated in the process were collected in multi layer sample bags supelco and analyzed by a gc fid tcd 7820a agilent allowing detection of h2 co co2 ch4 c2h6 and c3h8 fig 1 h2 and ch4 yield were calculated according to eq 1 and eq 2 respectively 1 y h 2 m m o l g c o d i n i t i a l m m o l h 2 c o d i n i t i a l g 2 y c h 4 m m o l g c o d i n i t i a l m m o l c h 4 c o d i n i t i a l g 3 results and discussion 3 1 catalyst characterization a number of factors including the nature and structure of the active phase and support material 25 governs catalyst performance for this reason these parameters were determined table 3 the ensaco carbon black support presented a specific surface area of 65 m2 g the introduction of the active metal hardly changed the original texture properties of the support a small reduction in support surface area is commonly observed after the introduction of the metal phase due to blockage of pores by metal nanoparticles 42 43 but in the current case this effect was negligible due to low metal load and the mainly mesoporous nature of the pores the ph slurry of the support was 8 9 and only decreased slightly up to 8 6 after the preparation of the catalyst this ph slurry facilitates apr process in terms of activity and selectivity to h2 since the basicity of the support favours wgs reaction and therefore h2 generation 28 44 45 while acidic supports may trigger reactions leading to alkane formation 46 47 the tem micrographs of pt ensaco catalysts revealed globular shape of the pt nanoparticles and good dispersion on the support material with very low occurrence of agglomerations and oversized nanoparticles fig 2 likewise pt nanoparticle size distribution was obtained and an average size of 4 7 nm was calculated with a standard deviation of 2 5 nm 3 2 apr of sewage sewage samples were treated to evaluate the application of apr to the removal of organic matter in terms of toc removal and hydrogen generation experiments with pt ensaco catalyst with metal free carbon black ensaco support and without catalyst or support blank were conducted to decouple adsorption thermal removal and catalytic removal of pollutants the toc removal gas composition total gas produced yh2 and ych4 obtained in these experiments table 4 in the blank assay removal of 28 5 toc occurred which can be attributed to hydrothermal carbonization of the organic matter due to reaction temperature 48 toc removal increased up to 62 1 for the assay with the metal free ensaco support the high removal achieved may be related to enhanced hydrothermal carbonization mediated by the support some contribution of adsorption to removal can be expected although ensaco carbon black has a low surface area 16 31 49 in the apr treatment of sewage catalysed by pt ensaco more than 55 of the initial toc was removed likewise differences in reaction mechanisms and degradation routes can be inferred from the production of gases the main component in all the tests was co2 indicating a contribution of hydrothermal carbonization in all cases and some production of hydrogen and alkanes through this route the absence of co in the gas produced in the catalysed run shows that under the operating conditions used the catalyst promoted additional formation of h2 by the water gas shift wgs reaction this feature was also observed in apr of glycerol with pt based catalysts 39 50 with the nature of the support material affecting h2 production 25 in the apr of sewage catalysed by pt ensaco a lower proportion of h2 was found in the produced gases than for runs with ensaco support alone probably due to consumption in methanation reactions as can be inferred from the high proportion of ch4 51 however the h2 and ch4 yields increased over 2 and 20 times respectively in the experiments carried out with pt ensaco catalyst the percentage of c2h6 and c3h8 in the produced gas was also higher for the pt ensaco catalysed test and in overall the higher selectivity to alkanes resulted in a lower proportion of co2 in the produced gas the yield to h2 in this work is lower than that reported in literature for apr of other substrates as brewery wastewater 0 4 vs 15 4 mmol gcodinitial respectively 36 at equivalent conditions this difference can be ascribed to the higher concentration in brewery wastewater of carbohydrates i e maltose which are more easily reformed than proteins from meat extract and especially to the much lower concentration of chloride in the brewery wastewater responsible for catalyst deactivation apr tests catalysed by pt ensaco were also conducted using sewage with different compositions in order to assess the role of individual organic components inorganic salts and ph as they may influence catalyst performance 25 the toc removal gas composition total gas produced yh2 and ych4 obtained in these experiments are shown in table 5 in the catalysed apr of sewage without salts the removal of toc increased from 55 to 58 which is ascribable to higher activity of the catalyst in the absence of chloride and sodium ions 35 in the case of the experiments conducted with sewage without oil the average toc removal was 67 showing that this component has a major influence in the catalytic performance probably due to adsorption of oil on the hydrophobic regions of the carbon black support and affecting the active sites it can also be observed that in the apr of individual components a remarkable toc removal of 93 3 is achieved in the case of starch whereas 60 5 of initial toc is removed in the case of meat extract toc removal is above 80 for oil and sucrose these results are in agreement with former works where apr was proved to be an efficient treatment for the conversion of carbohydrates to hydrogen although different initial substrates showed different behaviour 27 52 55 a relevant aspect regarding the application of apr is the stability of the catalysts in this sense pt ensaco was tested in a previous work 36 in 5 cycles of use in the apr of brewery wastewater with a cod of 6200 mg l toc removal decreased from 87 to 78 along the cycles therefore a higher of the catalysts can be expected in the case of sewage as the initial cod is significantly lower when apr of sewage without inorganic salts was conducted h2 concentration in the produced gas was significantly higher 21 1 than the average value 4 7 obtained in the reactions with salt containing sewage the presence of nacl in apr catalysed with pt based catalyst was found to be responsible for lower h2 selectivity in previous works due to poisoning of active sites 56 57 regarding the influence of initial ph of sewage the removal of toc increased slightly from 55 3 59 9 when ph increased from 6 5 8 h2 generation tends to increase with ph of the reaction medium 28 39 44 45 as basic conditions lead to high h2 selectivity in apr reactions 27 58 because of this effect when ph increased from 6 5 8 the percentage of h2 in the produced gas increased from 4 7 31 4 and the yield to h2 increased to a relevant value of 3 79 mmol gcodinitial optimization of the treatment and valorisation of sewage may require removal of some components and ph adjustment in particular oil removal is a common practice in treatment schemes the removal of toc achieved in this work can be increased by adjusting the pollutants to metal catalyst ratio since previous works have shown that in complex matrices also including carbohydrates and proteins the removal can be increased to c a 99 36 3 3 removal of micro pollutants by apr of sewage as conventional sewage treatment systems have in general low ability to eliminate micro pollutants the effectiveness of the apr process in removing caffeine carbamazepine diclofenac and ibuprofen was investigated in this study the micro pollutant removal for the blank ensaco support without metallic phase and pt ensaco catalyst table 6 the removal percentages of micro pollutants were 99 3 for caffeine 100 for carbamazepine and diclofenac and 88 9 for ibuprofen in the apr runs catalysed with pt ensaco tests performed with ensaco and pt ensaco showed a high removal of micro pollutants close or equal to 100 in most of the cases showing that both hydrothermal treatment and apr favoured an effective removal of micro pollutants likewise the emerging pollutants were removed in some extent in the case of the blank experiments particularly in the case of carbamazepine and diclofenac indicating that the structure of these compounds favours the hydrothermal carbonization route 59 adsorption may have a contribution to micro pollutants removal in the case of the experiments with ensaco and pt ensaco however only traces of micro pollutants was desorbed from materials after reaction runs when exposed to acetonitrile medium nevertheless adsorption can be expected to have an important role as part of the reaction pathway ensaco and pt ensaco showed different mechanisms to remove micropollutants according to results a first stage of adsorption on catalyst surface can be expected in both cases in the case of ensaco the hydrothermal carbonization htc was the main pathway involving hydrolysis decarboxylation dehydration and polymerization reactions 60 that favoured the formation of solid products and co2 in the case of pt ensaco reforming pathway involving the cleavage of cc and co bonds and water gas shift reaction predominantly favoured the formation of h2 and light alkanes 33 the gas composition total gas produced yh2 and ych4 in the apr of sewage with micro pollutants table 7 the h2 proportion was 1 7 in the experiments without catalyst 4 5 in the experiments with carbon material and 19 2 with pt ensaco catalyst these results show that the use of catalyst favour the removal of micro pollutants regarding the production of gas it increased together with yh2 and ych4 but it must be taken into account that runs were carried out without oil and salts to better trace the fate of micro pollutants 3 4 treated sewage reuse the apr process led to a toc removal of close to 60 table 5 resulting in a final toc of around 130 mg l and a high degree of micro pollutant removal caffeine 99 3 carbamazepine and diclofenac 100 and ibuprofen 99 6 allowed to reach in the apr process in general micropollutants achieve different removal rates for different treatment technologies caffeine removal has been shown to be effective with an efficiency of 100 due to its high degradation capacity 61 64 as for ibuprofen different studies indicate removal rates between 60 99 63 65 68 these two compounds have removal rates similar to those obtained in this study however for carbamazepine and diclofenac the removal achieved has been less than 30 in secondary treatments 69 71 presenting the apr technique removal reached 100 of the concentration what puts this technique in a great advantage in relation to the others considering the possibility of reusing the effluent generated after apr treatment in the industrial sector it can contribute to the increase in the consumption of recycled water in addition to the common uses such as cooling towers boiler feeding and cleaning and proceed to the use of these waters in industrial processes 72 proper management of water consumption can lead to savings of up to 30 in total consumption 3 new technologies capable of removing micro pollutants may support the establishment of minimum quality requirements for these parameters which are still absent or not consolidated in the reference documents for the practice of reuse 4 conclusions the results obtained indicate that the application of apr for the treatment of sanitary sewage has a clear potential for the elimination and valorization of the pollutants of biomass origin and with a view on water reuse toc removal by pt ensaco catalysts reached 55 3 93 3 for the sewage samples tested which can be increased by increasing catalyst load an alternative route to toc degradation by hydrothermal carbonization has also been identified although the catalytic route results in higher production of h2 and alkanes reaching up to 3 79 and 1 38 mmol gcodinitial respectively depending on wastewater composition and ph conditions pre treatment of sewage for oil removal is an interesting option to maximize sewage processability by apr and increase valuable gases production as for the micro pollutants carbamazepine diclofenac ibuprofen and caffeine the removal achieved was between 90 and 100 further assessment and validation work is needed on the optimization of operating conditions to maximize toc removal and elimination of target micro pollutants an additional consideration to be addresses is process energy integration to assess how the valuable gases generated

13878,ciprofloxacin cip an important class of antibiotics is greatly used and discharged into aquatic environment which causes severe environmental issues in this study nano scaled stable and highly reactive zerovalent copper cu was synthesized for the treatment of ciprofloxacin cip in aqueous solution the cu is an important material due to its high reduction potential and thus significantly degrade emerging organic pollutants besides the cu synthesized in this study showed good surface area i e 16 89 m2 g and caused 63 removal of cip at 105 min under the conditions of cu 0 0 5 g l and cip 0 10 ppm however when h2o2 was used with cu the removal of cip was promoted from 65 to 85 at 105 min using cu 0 0 5 g l cip 0 10 ppm and h2o2 0 40 ppm cip removal by cu h2o2 was due to oh that showed high reactivity i e 3 95 109 m s 1 towards cip the use of high h2o2 0 and cu 0 but lower cip 0 promoted the removal of cip the change in ph addition of inorganic ions and use of oh scavengers also influenced the removal of cip by cu h2o2 total organic carbon toc removal of cip was investigated and showed 78 removal of toc at 800 min degradation products dps of cip were investigated to establish degradation pathways the cu h2o2 was found to have high potential in the removal of cip in aqueous solution as it resulted in high toc removal of cip and formation of inorganic dps and non toxic acetate keywords ciprofloxacin degradation pathways h2o2 zerovalent copper water treatment 1 introduction water is an important commodity of the universe however quality of water is deteriorating by contamination with different emerging pollutant 1 4 the most important contaminants which are contributing greatly to the water pollutions are heavy metals dyes and pharmaceuticals 5 9 antibiotics are amongst the most widely used pharmaceuticals for treatment of infection diseases and reportedly cause severe contaminate to aquatic environment 9 10 antibiotics are reported to exhibit biological functions even at small concentrations thus the presence of antibiotics in water even at trace level leads to severe consequences on environment and human health 9 11 12 one of the most important antibiotics include ciprofloxacin cip which is an important member of fluoroquinolone group and used extensively as a medication due to its greater applications against both gram positive and gram negative bacteria 9 13 high concentrations of cip and its degradation products dps are reported in water resources and reported to be the source of bacterial resistance and other severe issues to aquatic and terrestrial organisms 9 13 important sources of cip contamination include domestic discharge hospital wastewater and effluents from pharmaceutical industries 9 13 to control the issues of cip as well as its dps in aquatic environment and control their further discharge into water resources requires developing emerging treatment technologies the complex structure as well as the severe issues caused by cip and its dps make the use of conventional physical chemical and biological treatment inefficient for their effective removal from aquatic environment 12 16 alternatively fenton reaction involving ferrous fe2 mediated h2o2 based oxidation is recognized as a viable and highly rewarding technology in the degradation of highly toxic recalcitrant pollutants 14 15 17 traditional metal ion based fenton oxidation processes requires continuous supply of metal ions to keep the system functioning restricted to narrow range of ph lack recycling of the fe catalyst and require high cost and are thus not recommended for potential practical applications 15 the recently introduced zerovalent metal zvms materials are advantageous as a fenton like catalyst since they provide steady supply of metal ions for peroxides decomposition into reactive oxygen species ros and works even at neutral ph undergo ease quenching of ros and bear minimum cost 18 19 zerovalent iron zvi is an important class of zvms which is extensively used for treatment of a number of pollutants 18 some of the halogenated compounds with higher carbon chlorine bond are reported to be inefficiently degraded by zvi 20 on contrary the zerovalent copper nanoparticles nzvc cu appears as an alternative to the zvi due to unique characteristics of nzvc such as greater stability in water low cost high reduction potential and enhanced efficiencies 21 besides previous study shows that nzvcu play vital role in catalytic dehalogenation and other coupling reactions 20 thus in the present study nzvc was synthesized and used as a fenton like catalyst for the degradation of cip the coupling of h2o2 with fenton like catalyst undergoes surface oxidation of nzvcu via loss of electron and produces copper ions which together with h2o2 produces oh as shown in following reactions 1 3 18 1 2 c u 0 h 2 o 2 2 h 2 c u 2 h 2 o 2 c u h 2 o 2 c u 2 o h o h 3 c u 2 h 2 o 2 c u 3 o h o h the oh produced is a strong oxidant due to its high oxidation potential and readily attack target contaminants causing their degradation into dps as shown in reactions 4 and 5 22 4 o h c i p i n t e r m e d i a t e s 5 o h i n t e r m e d i a t e s d p s some of the dps of pharmaceuticals are reported to be toxic and in some cases even more toxic than the parent contaminants thus toxicities of cip and its dps were estimated in present study 11 12 as a first part of this study highly stable and efficient cu0 nanoparticles were synthesized using ethanol and borohydride bh4 based chemical reduction method and characterized for physiochemical properties the synthesized cu0 were applied for degradation of cip in the absence and presence of h2o2 removal of cip by the prepared catalyst with the added h2o2 was evaluated under different conditions concentration of cu0 h2o2 and cip ph of aqueous solution and inorganic ions the cu0 mediated decomposition of h2o2 leading to formation of oh and reactivity of the later with cip were investigated mass spectrometric studies were performed to identify the dps of cip formed from the degradation of oh and to establish degradation pathways the toxicities of cip and its dps were also estimated using toxicity evaluation program 2 material and method 2 1 materials the materials and chemical used in this study were extra pure and used as received ciprofloxacin cip copper sulfate cuso4 7h2o sodium borohydride and h2o2 were purchased from supelco pa usa other chemicals that include hclo4 naoh ethanol t buoh kcl ch3co2na nano2 naco3 and

were obtained from milli q system millipore 2 2 synthesis of nzvc chemical reduction method using borohydride bh4 as the reductant was performed to synthesize cu0 as described in reaction 6 the reactor used for the synthesis of nzvc was connected with nitrogen cylinder in order to provide n2 flow into the reaction prevent excess of air into the reaction solution and prepare air free stable cu0 nanoparticles 6 c u 2 2 b h 4 6 h 2 o c u 0 2 b o h 3 7 h 2 for the preparation of nzvc 5 0 g of copper sulfate was dissolved in a mixture of water and ethanol 70 ml water and 10 ml ethanol in air tight and alumium foil sealed beaker while 3 5 g of nabh4 was dissolved in 70 ml of water the prepared bh4 solution was transferred into a burette and then added slowly drop by drop into the solution of cu2 as the solution of bh4 was added into the cu2 solution it resulted into immediate formation of black precipitate of nzvc the total volume of prepared bh4 solution was added so as to get maximum amount of nzvc particles from the precipitate of cu the aqueous layer was removed and was washed with ethanol two times to minimize the excess of air into the copper particles and ultimately to prepare stable nzvc particles the nzvc materials washed with ethanol were finally taken in petri dish and kept in oven at 65 c for drying for 8 h the dried copper materials were stored in n2 purged air tight vials to prevent excess of air and were characterized before their use for degradation of cip 2 3 characterization of nzvc the functional groups crystallography properties exterior

using quaternary pump xdb c18 column 150 4 6 mm 5 Î¼m particle size the analysis was done using a variable wavelength detector vwd adjusted at a wavelength of 275 nm the details of mobile phase used for analysis of cip with hplc as well as analytical procedure for identification of dps of cip using uplc ms ms are described in our previous publication 12 the effects of different operational parameters were investigated using different concentrations of cip nzvc and h2o2 the removal efficiency of cip by cu h2o2 was also investigated in the presence of different inorganic ions and at different ph of aqueous solutions which was adjusted using 0 05 m hclo4 and or naoh the measurement of toc removal of cip by cu h2o2 was investigated at high treatment times i e 800 min under high concentrations of cu i e 2 0 g l and h2o2 200 ppm each treatment of cip by cu h2o2 were performed for three cycles and error bars were used on each figure to represent standard error of the mean the

toc analyzer vcsh asi schimadzu following the method reported by shah et al 12 the oh produced from cu0 mediated decomposition of h2o2 was analyzed using electron spin resonance esr spectroscopy method as described in our previous publication 12 2 5 ecotoxicity evaluation to evaluate acute and chronic toxicities of cip as well as its dps ecological structure activity relationship program ecosar was used 24 this program is one of the most promising tools for measuring toxicities of refractory organic pollutants towards aquatic organisms i e fish daphnia and green algae 25 26 the ecosar can be effectively used to measure toxicities of cip and its dps due to their lower molar mass i e mw 1000 the procedure for measuring toxicities of organic pollutants by ecosar is detailed in our previous publications 12 17 3 results and discussions 3 1 characterization of nzvc the ir spectra of the synthesized nzvc is shown in fig 1a in the range from 400 to 4000 cm 1 which illustrate characteristics peaks of bo3 groups at 924 and 1347 cm 1 corresponding to anti symmetrical stretching and symmetrical stretching vibrations due to vibrations of bo bonds in v1 bo3 and v3 bo3 respectively the peak appearing due to bo3 is due to the bh4 used as a reducing agent in the formation of zvc from cu2 the peak appearing at 1600 cm 1 refer to the co group vibration fig 1b depicts the xrd spectra of the synthesized nzvc in the range of 2Î¸ 10 90 degree and showed characteristic peak at 2Î¸ 42 48 and 72 degree which corresponds to the cu confirming the successful formation of the cu by borohydride based chemical reduction method while the peaks at 36 and 62 indicates trace amount of cu2o moreover three peaks 2Î¸ at 42 48 and 72 represents the 111 200 220 planes of nzvc and thereby confirming face centered cubic fcc crystal formation the crystalline size d nm of nzvc was calculated from the xrd analysis using debye scherrer eq 7 27 7 d k Î» Î² cos Î¸ putting the values of Î» x ray wavelength as 0 15406 nm k 0 9 Î² equal to half intensity of the xrd peak width and Î¸ diffraction angle the value of d for nzvc was calculated to be 1 40 nm the xrd analysis showed the prepared nzvc is pure in nature with no foreign contamination from the precursors such crystallographic properties of the as synthesized nzvc like small crystallite size and high specific surface area are responsible for its high efficiency in the degradation of ciprofloxacin fig 1c depicts the sem study of the nzvc which shows flowery microsphere like shape of the nzvc particles comprising of thin flakes the nzvc particles appeared to be small sized homogenous and porous containing large number of pores between the particles the presence of large number of pores demonstrates the potential of the prepared nzvc for increased adsorption of micro pollutant on its surface 28 29 the tem hrtem and xps analyses of the nzvc were also performed and the results are described in our previous publication 23 the tem hrtem analysis showed the cu0 particles to be small nano sized homogenous less aggregated and highly crystalline 23 the xps analysis discussed in iqbal et al 23 study suggest successful formation of cu0 by borohydride based chemical reduction method and showed characteristic peaks of cu0 at binding energies of 2p3 2 932 8 ev and 2p1 2 952 8 ev the n2 adsorption desorption analysis of nzvc was performed at 77 k to calculate the surface characteristics of nzvc and showed bet surface area 16 89 m2 g pore volume 0 0264 cm3 g and pore size 8 09 nm the high surface area and pore volume suggest the nzvc to be a good adsorbent and is expected to accumulate high concentrations of the target contaminant molecules 30 31 3 2 nzvc mediated h2o2 based degradation of cip the role of nzvc with h2o2 in the degradation of cip was explored by performing different experiments e g use of h2o2 only cu only and cu mediated h2o2 cu h2o2 the results achieved were found to be 8 63 and 85 by h2o2 only cu only and cu h2o2 at a treatment time of 105 min fig 2 the presence of h2o2 did not appreciably remove cip and was consistent to the trend observed in previous study 22 however the presence of catalysts cu with h2o2 i e cu h2o2 gave appreciable degradation of cip i e 85 in the presence of catalyst the h2o2 decomposed into hydroxyl radical hr oh as shown in reactions 1 3 and the oh due to its high oxidation potential react very fast with organic contaminants 22 32 33 the high reactivity of led to rapid reaction of oh with target the contaminants and cause their degradation into dps as shown in reactions 4 and 5 the oh produced from the decomposition of h2o2 by cu0 was verified through scavenger study using t buoh tba as the oh scavenger i e k o h t b a 6 0 10 8 m s 1 34 the tba added to an aqueous cip solution and treated with cu0 mediated h2o2 based process inhibited removal of cip which suggest these processes yield oh and the later participate in the degradation of cip fig 2 electron spin resonance esr study was performed with dmpo as the oh spin trapping agent to further testify the oh formation in cu mediated h2o2 processes initially at 0 min the esr spectra did not show any peak however when treatment time was elevated to 10 min cu mediated h2o2 gave peak of dmpo oh adduct fig s1 supporting information the peak appeared at 10 min suggest significant h2o2 decomposition by cu into oh the intensity of peak significantly increases at treatment time of 30 min which suggest increase in h2o2 decomposition rate and consequently increase in the rate of oh formation the competition kinetic study shown in eq 8 employing p cba as the oh competitor e g k o h p c b a 5 0 10 9 m s 1 34 was performed to estimate reactivity of oh with cip 22 8 k

and p cba degradation in cu h2o2 and cu processes while k is the second order rate constants of oh with cip and p cba identical concentrations of cip and p cba were used and the value of k o h c p y was calculated to be 3 95 109 m s 1 which suggest fast reactivity of oh with cip the removal of cip was also studied using cu alone which resulted in appreciable degradation fig 2 it has been reported that surface zerovalent metals undergo oxidation into metal ions following the loss of electrons 18 the electron being strong reductant due to high reduction potential 2 9 v readily attack halogenated compounds r x e g cip as shown in reaction 9 and causes their degradation 35 the yield of electron from oxidation of cu was estimated through the use of nitrate anion no3 which is a strong scavenger of electron e as shown in reaction 10 34 the use of no3 declined the degradation of cip by cu fig s2 supporting information no3 reacts at high rate with eaq and retard its reactivity with cip the decreased cip degradation by cu in the presence of no3 suggest that cu is oxidized into e 9 e a q r x x r 10 n o 3 e a q n o 3 2 k 9 8 10 9 m 1 s 1 other possible reason causing the removal of cip by cu0 include the contact between cip molecules and surface of the copper 36 38 the high bet surface area suggest greater accumulation of cip molecules on the surface of cu0 which consequently led to optimum removal of cip 3 3 effects of h2o2 cu0 and cip initial concentrations 3 3 1 effect of h2o2 0 since addition of h2o2 to cu accelerated degradation of cip due to formation of oh thus increase in h2o2 0 is expected to promote the rate of formation of oh and consequently improve degradation of cip thus in this study h2o2 initial concentrations were varied from 20 to 160 ppm and kept constant cu 0 0 5 g l and cip 0 10 ppm the raise in h2o2 0 significantly promoted cip degradation and was found to be 53 at h2o2 0 40 ppm and 83 at h2o2 0 160 ppm after 80 min of reaction fig 3a the increase in h2o2 0 increase the rate of formation of oh and consequently promote target contaminant degradation 39 3 3 2 effect of cu 0 since cu catalyze h2o2 into oh thus the use of high level of cu 0 could promote the yield of oh and consequently improve removal efficiency of cip thus different level of cu 0 i e 0 25 2 0 g l was employed to treat cip solutions under constant cip 0 10 ppm and h2o2 0 40 ppm the high level of cu promoted the removal efficiency of cip and was found to be 56 at cu 0 0 25 g l and 87 at cu 0 2 0 g l after 80 min treatment fig 3b the prompt removal efficiency of cip at high level of cu 0 could be due to the enhanced decomposition of h2o2 and consequently high rate of formation of oh the results achieved were consistent to the trend observed in previous studies 13 35 39 other possible reasons for the prompt removal efficiency of cip at high level of cu 0 could be the availability of maximum adsorption sites 12 19 40 41 3 3 3 effect of cip 0 the use of cu mediated h2o2 based technologies was also investigated to treat different concentrations of the target contaminant different initial concentrations of cip ranging from 2 5 20 ppm were used while keeping constant levels of cu 0 0 5 g l and h2o2 0 40 ppm the use of high concentrations of cip declined the removal of cip and was found to be 43 at cip 0 20 ppm and 85 at cip 0 2 5 ppm at 80 min reaction times fig 3c similar trends have been reported in previous studies too 12 13 42 the most possible reasons for the decrease in removal efficiency of cip at its high concentration include a increase in the number of cip and consequent reduction in the ratio of oh to cip molecules b increase in the concentrations of dps with elevating cip 0 and consequently greater competition between cip and dps for oh and c competition between cip and its dps for adsorption sites of cu 0 that is expected to be higher at high concentrations of cip 12 13 42 besides removal efficiency of cip the degradation rate defined as the change in concentration of the target contaminant per unit time Î¼m min was calculated for all the studied concentrations at 20 min the increase in cip 0 resulted in high degradation rate of cip data not shown the availability of maximum number of cip molecules exposed to reactive radicals at high cip 0 can be the possible reason for high degradation rate at high cip 0 22 3 4 effects of ph and inorganic ions 3 4 1 ph it has been reported that catalytic degradation of the target contaminants by zerovalent metals mediated peroxide based degradation is greatly influenced by ph of aqueous solution 12 19 the possible reasons are the variation in the electronic charge on the surface of the catalysts and contaminants variation in oxidation potential of oh and influence on the activity of the catalyst 43 45 in the present study thus removal of cip by cu0 mediated h2o2 based degradation was investigated at different ph of aqueous solutions i e ph 3 11 2 the cu0 mediated h2o2 based process resulted in cip removal of 85 at ph 8 0 78 at ph 5 8 69 at ph 3 0 and 53 at ph 11 2 fig 4 the point of zero charge of cu0 has been reported to be 8 2 which suggest negatively charged surface of cu0 at ph 8 2 and positively charged at ph 8 2 46 the pka values of cip i e 6 0 and 8 5 suggest that cip surface bear positive charge at ph 6 0 and negative charge at ph 8 5 the high removal of cip at ph 8 0 looked to be due to neutral nature of both cu0 and cip resulting into maximum accumulation of cip molecules on the surface of cu0 also the weak alkaline conditions enhance the yield of oh the decline in removal efficiency of cip at acidic and highly alkaline ph could be due to the repulsive interaction between cip and cu0 as both the catalyst and cip bears identical charges at acidic and highly alkaline ph the removal of cip was inhibited to less extent than that at high alkaline ph possible due to rapid corrosion of zerovalent metal at acidc ph and ease oxidation 12 other reason for the low removal of cip at high alkaline ph looked be the decrease in oxidation potential of oh 22 3 4 2 inorganic ions presence inorganic ions are main constituents of natural water and are reported to react rapidly with oh and consequently affect reactivity of oh with target contaminants 12 22 besides these ions compete with cip molecules to adsorb on the surface of cu0 thus effects of selected inorganic anions found in natural water were investigated on cu0 h2o2 mediated degradation of cip table 1 the addition of ions influenced the degradation of cip in the order of no2 co3 2 hco3 cu cl fe2 no3 table 1 the fast reactivity of no2 with oh as shown in reaction 11 possibly greatly restrained the reactivity of oh with cip and consequently caused more inhibition in cip degradation 32 34 the addition of co3 2 and hco3 to an aqueous cip solution treated with cu0 h2o2 also caused greater inhibition in cip degradation and the possible reasons looked to be the fast reactivity of co3 2 and hco3 with oh as shown in reactions 12 and 13 12 17 34 other possible reason looked to be the boost in ph of aqueous solution due to both co3 2 and hco3 and high ph was found to retard catalytic degradation of cip the catalytic degradation of cip by cu0 h2o2 was comparatively less restrained by cu fe2 and cl though these ions have very fast kinetics with oh reaction 14 16 in the case of cu and fe2 the possible reasons looked to be the catalytic role of cu in decomposition of h2o2 into oh 19 47 similarly cl react with oh and form reactive species i e cloh and cl reactions 16 and 17 which are reported to be involved in the degradation of target contaminants 17 19 34 the removal of cip by cu0 h2o2 was inhibited to minimal level by no3 which was possible due to slower reactivity of the later with oh and was consistent with the trend observed in previous studies 12 17 11 o h n o 2 o h n o 2 k 8 1 10 9 m 1 s 1 12 o h c o 3 2 o h c o 3 k 4 1 10 8 m 1 s 1

5 m 1 s 1 3 5 toc removal of cip to accurately monitor potential of the treatment technologies in mass reduction of the toxic organic pollutants removal of toc by cu h2o2 was evaluated 48 49 the toc removal of cip was 30 at 105 min of treatment however toc removal was promoted to 78 at 800 min treatment in the presence of high concentrations cu and h2o2 fig 5 the prompt toc removal at high treatment time and high concentrations of catalyst and peroxide was because that toc removal is a complex and multistep process and might involve formation of persistent intermediate products 12 48 the high toc removal depicts that cu h2o2 have great potential in the remediation of toxic organic pollutants 3 6 proposed degradation pathways of cip the oh mediated degradation of cip resulted into several organic and inorganic dps the organic dps were analyzed using uplc ms ms scheme 1 based on the interpretation of mass spectra of the dps as shown in fig s3 a c in supporting information the inorganic products were analyzed through ic the organic dps were not quantified successfully due to non availability of authentic standards of the dps the first dp reported herein as dp1 as shown in pathway i was formed through h abstraction by oh and was reported in previous study too 50 51 the oh attack dp1 and transfer it into dp2 following decarboxylation reaction the formation of dp3 was found due to the replacement of f by oh and was reported in previous study too 12 the attack of oh on the n of piperazine ring involving electron abstraction form first aminium radical cation and then dp4 through the loss of ethylene group 13 51 the attack of oh on n of dp4 form first aminium radical cation then undergo loss of ethylamine and form dp5 13 the dp6 shown in pathway ii is formed from the oh at the side piperazine ring following abstraction of electron then formation of aminium radical cation and finally loss of ethylene group 13 the dp6 transform into dp7 with the further attack of oh and loss of ethylamine the attack of oh involving h abstraction from the c bearing double bond form oh derivative that undergo decarboxylation and form dp8 the oxidation of nh2 into no2 group transform the dp8 into dp9 and was reported in previous study too 12 the ic analysis showed formation of inorganic ionic products no3 ch3co2 and f from the degradation of cip by cu0 h2o2 the loss of these inorganic products from cip suggest high potential of the treatment technology for remediation of cip 3 7 ecotoxicity evaluation of cip and its dps the study of ecotoxicity evaluation is important to assess potential and removal efficacy of the cu0 h2o2 for treating cip in the present study ecotoxicities in term of acute and or chronic toxicities of cip and its dps were estimated towards fish green algae and daphnia using the chinese hazard evaluation criteria and european union guidelines as described in our previous publications 12 19 the results as shown in table 2 depict the parent compound cip to be non toxic however most of the dps showed high toxicities the generation of toxic dps from degradation of cip by cu h2o2 provide future perspective for researchers to look into the toxicities of organic pollutants as well as their dps the formation of acetate reported to be non toxic suggest the end products to be non toxic and suggest high potential of the treatment technology 4 conclusions in the present study highly stable crystalline mesoporous nano sized and efficient cu0 was synthesized by borohydride based chemical reduction method using mixture of ethanol and water as the precursor solvent the synthesized cu0 proved to be highly effective in the degradation of cip and decomposition of h2o2 into oh the oh played vital role in the degradation of cip and role of oh was influenced by radical scavengers concentrations of h2o2 and cu0 ph 0 and use of co existing inorganic ions degradation pathways of cip were established based on the investigation of dps of cip by uplc ms ms and ic analyses the dps analyzed showed high toxicities than cip which open new windows for researchers to investigate toxicities of dps along with parent organic pollutants the evolution of inorganic dps and formation of non toxic acetate suggest the viable potential of cu0 h2o2 in remediation and detoxification of cip declaration of competing interest authors do not have

13878,ciprofloxacin cip an important class of antibiotics is greatly used and discharged into aquatic environment which causes severe environmental issues in this study nano scaled stable and highly reactive zerovalent copper cu was synthesized for the treatment of ciprofloxacin cip in aqueous solution the cu is an important material due to its high reduction potential and thus significantly degrade emerging organic pollutants besides the cu synthesized in this study showed good surface area i e 16 89 m2 g and caused 63 removal of cip at 105 min under the conditions of cu 0 0 5 g l and cip 0 10 ppm however when h2o2 was used with cu the removal of cip was promoted from 65 to 85 at 105 min using cu 0 0 5 g l cip 0 10 ppm and h2o2 0 40 ppm cip removal by cu h2o2 was due to oh that showed high reactivity i e 3 95 109 m s 1 towards cip the use of high h2o2 0 and cu 0 but lower cip 0 promoted the removal of cip the change in ph addition of inorganic ions and use of oh scavengers also influenced the removal of cip by cu h2o2 total organic carbon toc removal of cip was investigated and showed 78 removal of toc at 800 min degradation products dps of cip were investigated to establish degradation pathways the cu h2o2 was found to have high potential in the removal of cip in aqueous solution as it resulted in high toc removal of cip and formation of inorganic dps and non toxic acetate keywords ciprofloxacin degradation pathways h2o2 zerovalent copper water treatment 1 introduction water is an important commodity of the universe however quality of water is deteriorating by contamination with different emerging pollutant 1 4 the most important contaminants which are contributing greatly to the water pollutions are heavy metals dyes and pharmaceuticals 5 9 antibiotics are amongst the most widely used pharmaceuticals for treatment of infection diseases and reportedly cause severe contaminate to aquatic environment 9 10 antibiotics are reported to exhibit biological functions even at small concentrations thus the presence of antibiotics in water even at trace level leads to severe consequences on environment and human health 9 11 12 one of the most important antibiotics include ciprofloxacin cip which is an important member of fluoroquinolone group and used extensively as a medication due to its greater applications against both gram positive and gram negative bacteria 9 13 high concentrations of cip and its degradation products dps are reported in water resources and reported to be the source of bacterial resistance and other severe issues to aquatic and terrestrial organisms 9 13 important sources of cip contamination include domestic discharge hospital wastewater and effluents from pharmaceutical industries 9 13 to control the issues of cip as well as its dps in aquatic environment and control their further discharge into water resources requires developing emerging treatment technologies the complex structure as well as the severe issues caused by cip and its dps make the use of conventional physical chemical and biological treatment inefficient for their effective removal from aquatic environment 12 16 alternatively fenton reaction involving ferrous fe2 mediated h2o2 based oxidation is recognized as a viable and highly rewarding technology in the degradation of highly toxic recalcitrant pollutants 14 15 17 traditional metal ion based fenton oxidation processes requires continuous supply of metal ions to keep the system functioning restricted to narrow range of ph lack recycling of the fe catalyst and require high cost and are thus not recommended for potential practical applications 15 the recently introduced zerovalent metal zvms materials are advantageous as a fenton like catalyst since they provide steady supply of metal ions for peroxides decomposition into reactive oxygen species ros and works even at neutral ph undergo ease quenching of ros and bear minimum cost 18 19 zerovalent iron zvi is an important class of zvms which is extensively used for treatment of a number of pollutants 18 some of the halogenated compounds with higher carbon chlorine bond are reported to be inefficiently degraded by zvi 20 on contrary the zerovalent copper nanoparticles nzvc cu appears as an alternative to the zvi due to unique characteristics of nzvc such as greater stability in water low cost high reduction potential and enhanced efficiencies 21 besides previous study shows that nzvcu play vital role in catalytic dehalogenation and other coupling reactions 20 thus in the present study nzvc was synthesized and used as a fenton like catalyst for the degradation of cip the coupling of h2o2 with fenton like catalyst undergoes surface oxidation of nzvcu via loss of electron and produces copper ions which together with h2o2 produces oh as shown in following reactions 1 3 18 1 2 c u 0 h 2 o 2 2 h 2 c u 2 h 2 o 2 c u h 2 o 2 c u 2 o h o h 3 c u 2 h 2 o 2 c u 3 o h o h the oh produced is a strong oxidant due to its high oxidation potential and readily attack target contaminants causing their degradation into dps as shown in reactions 4 and 5 22 4 o h c i p i n t e r m e d i a t e s 5 o h i n t e r m e d i a t e s d p s some of the dps of pharmaceuticals are reported to be toxic and in some cases even more toxic than the parent contaminants thus toxicities of cip and its dps were estimated in present study 11 12 as a first part of this study highly stable and efficient cu0 nanoparticles were synthesized using ethanol and borohydride bh4 based chemical reduction method and characterized for physiochemical properties the synthesized cu0 were applied for degradation of cip in the absence and presence of h2o2 removal of cip by the prepared catalyst with the added h2o2 was evaluated under different conditions concentration of cu0 h2o2 and cip ph of aqueous solution and inorganic ions the cu0 mediated decomposition of h2o2 leading to formation of oh and reactivity of the later with cip were investigated mass spectrometric studies were performed to identify the dps of cip formed from the degradation of oh and to establish degradation pathways the toxicities of cip and its dps were also estimated using toxicity evaluation program 2 material and method 2 1 materials the materials and chemical used in this study were extra pure and used as

were obtained from milli q system millipore 2 2 synthesis of nzvc chemical reduction method using borohydride bh4 as the reductant was performed to synthesize cu0 as described in reaction 6 the reactor used for the synthesis of nzvc was connected with nitrogen cylinder in order to provide n2 flow into the reaction prevent excess of air into the reaction solution and prepare air free stable cu0 nanoparticles 6 c u 2 2 b h 4 6 h 2 o c u 0 2 b o h 3 7 h 2 for the preparation of nzvc 5 0 g of copper sulfate was dissolved in a mixture of water and ethanol 70 ml water and 10 ml ethanol in air tight and alumium foil sealed beaker while 3 5 g of nabh4 was dissolved in 70 ml of water the prepared bh4 solution was transferred into a burette and then added slowly drop by drop into the solution of cu2 as the solution of bh4 was added into the cu2 solution it resulted into immediate formation of black precipitate of nzvc the total volume of prepared bh4 solution was added so as to get maximum amount of nzvc particles from the precipitate of cu the aqueous layer was removed and was washed with ethanol two times to minimize the excess of air into the copper particles and ultimately to prepare stable nzvc particles the nzvc materials washed with ethanol were finally taken in petri dish and kept in oven at 65 c for drying for 8 h the dried copper materials were stored in n2 purged air tight vials to prevent excess of air and were characterized before their use for degradation of cip 2 3 characterization of nzvc the functional groups crystallography properties exterior

reactor after each treatment 300 Î¼l of the treated cip solution was taken mixed with 300 Î¼l methanol employed as the oh quenching agent and then analyzed with hplc agilent technologies 1200 series using quaternary pump xdb c18 column 150 4 6 mm 5 Î¼m particle size the analysis was done using a variable wavelength detector vwd adjusted at a wavelength of 275 nm the details of mobile phase used for analysis of cip with hplc as well as analytical procedure for identification of dps of cip using uplc ms ms are described in our previous publication 12 the effects of different operational parameters were investigated using different concentrations of cip nzvc and h2o2 the removal efficiency of cip by cu h2o2 was also investigated in the presence of different inorganic ions and at different ph of aqueous solutions which was adjusted using 0 05 m hclo4 and or naoh the measurement of toc removal of cip by cu h2o2 was investigated at high treatment times i e 800 min under high concentrations of cu i e 2 0 g l and h2o2 200 ppm each treatment of cip by cu h2o2 were performed for three cycles and error bars were used on each figure to represent standard error of the mean the anionic products evolved from cip degradation by cu h2o2 were analyzed by ion chromatograph ic 800 series metrohm using the method reported by sayed et al 13 p cba was used for competition kinetic study and analysis of p cba was performed using the hplc method as described by sayed et al 13 toc removal of cip by cu0 h2o2 was also done and decrease in level of the toc of cip was measured using toc analyzer vcsh asi schimadzu following the method reported by shah et al 12 the oh produced from cu0 mediated decomposition of h2o2 was analyzed using electron spin resonance esr spectroscopy method as described in our previous publication 12 2 5 ecotoxicity evaluation to evaluate acute and chronic toxicities of cip as well as its dps ecological structure activity relationship program ecosar was used 24 this program is one of the most promising tools for measuring toxicities of refractory organic pollutants towards aquatic organisms i e fish daphnia and green algae 25 26 the ecosar can be effectively used to measure toxicities of cip and its dps due to their lower molar mass i e mw 1000 the procedure for measuring toxicities of organic pollutants by ecosar is detailed in our previous publications 12 17 3 results and discussions 3 1 characterization of nzvc the ir spectra of the synthesized nzvc is shown in fig 1a in the range from 400 to 4000 cm 1 which illustrate characteristics peaks of bo3 groups at 924 and 1347 cm 1 corresponding to anti symmetrical stretching and symmetrical stretching vibrations due to vibrations of bo bonds in v1 bo3 and v3 bo3 respectively the peak appearing due to bo3 is due to the bh4 used as a reducing agent in the formation of zvc from cu2 the peak appearing at 1600 cm 1 refer to the co group vibration fig 1b depicts the xrd spectra of the synthesized nzvc in the range of 2Î¸ 10 90 degree and showed characteristic peak at 2Î¸ 42 48 and 72 degree which corresponds to the cu confirming the successful formation of the cu by borohydride based chemical reduction method while the peaks at 36 and 62 indicates trace amount of cu2o moreover three peaks 2Î¸ at 42 48 and 72 represents the 111 200 220 planes of nzvc and thereby confirming face centered cubic fcc crystal formation the crystalline size d nm of nzvc was calculated from the xrd analysis using debye scherrer eq 7 27 7 d k Î» Î² cos Î¸ putting the values of Î» x ray wavelength as 0 15406 nm k 0 9 Î² equal to half intensity of the xrd peak width and Î¸ diffraction angle the value of d for nzvc was calculated to be 1 40 nm the xrd analysis showed the prepared nzvc is pure in nature with no foreign contamination from the precursors such crystallographic properties of the as synthesized nzvc like small crystallite size and high specific surface area are responsible for its high efficiency in the degradation of ciprofloxacin fig 1c depicts the sem study of the nzvc which shows flowery microsphere like shape of the nzvc particles comprising of thin flakes the nzvc particles appeared to be small sized homogenous and porous containing large number of pores between the particles the presence of large number of pores demonstrates the potential of the prepared nzvc for increased adsorption of micro pollutant on its surface 28 29 the tem hrtem and xps analyses of the nzvc were also performed and the results are described in our previous publication 23 the tem hrtem analysis showed the cu0 particles to be small nano sized homogenous less aggregated and highly crystalline 23 the xps analysis discussed in iqbal et al 23 study suggest successful formation of cu0 by borohydride based chemical reduction method and showed characteristic peaks of cu0 at binding energies of 2p3 2 932 8 ev and 2p1 2 952 8 ev the n2 adsorption desorption analysis of nzvc was performed at 77 k to calculate the surface characteristics of nzvc and showed bet surface area 16 89 m2 g pore volume 0 0264 cm3 g and pore size 8 09 nm the high surface area and pore volume suggest the nzvc to be a good adsorbent and is expected to accumulate high concentrations of the target contaminant molecules 30 31 3 2 nzvc mediated h2o2 based degradation of cip the role of nzvc with h2o2 in the degradation of cip was explored by performing different experiments e g use of h2o2 only cu only and cu mediated h2o2 cu h2o2 the results achieved were found to be 8 63 and 85 by h2o2 only cu only and cu h2o2 at a treatment time of 105 min fig 2 the presence of h2o2 did not appreciably remove cip and was consistent to the trend observed in previous study 22 however the presence of catalysts cu with h2o2 i e cu h2o2 gave appreciable degradation of cip i e 85 in the presence of catalyst the h2o2 decomposed into hydroxyl radical hr oh as shown in reactions 1 3 and the oh due to its high oxidation potential react very fast with organic contaminants 22 32 33 the high reactivity of led to rapid reaction of oh with target the contaminants and cause their degradation into dps as shown in reactions 4 and 5 the oh produced from the decomposition of h2o2 by cu0 was verified through scavenger study using t buoh tba as the oh scavenger i e k o h t b a 6 0 10 8 m s 1 34 the tba added to an aqueous cip solution and treated with cu0 mediated h2o2 based process inhibited removal of cip which suggest these processes yield oh and the later participate in the degradation of cip fig 2 electron spin resonance esr study was performed with dmpo as the oh spin trapping agent to further testify the oh formation in cu mediated h2o2 processes initially at 0 min the esr spectra did not show any peak however when treatment time was elevated to 10 min cu mediated h2o2 gave peak of dmpo oh adduct fig s1 supporting information the peak appeared at 10 min suggest significant h2o2 decomposition by cu into oh the intensity of peak significantly increases at treatment time of 30 min which suggest increase in h2o2 decomposition rate and consequently increase in the rate of oh formation the competition kinetic study shown in eq 8 employing p cba as the oh competitor e g k o h p c b a 5 0 10 9 m s 1 34 was performed to estimate reactivity of oh with cip 22 8 k

and p cba degradation in cu h2o2 and cu processes while k is the second order rate constants of oh with cip and p cba identical concentrations of cip and p cba were used and the value of k o h c p y was calculated to be 3 95 109 m s 1 which suggest fast reactivity of oh with cip the removal of cip was also studied using cu alone which resulted in appreciable degradation fig 2 it has been reported that surface zerovalent metals undergo oxidation into metal ions following the loss of electrons 18 the electron being strong reductant due to high reduction potential 2 9 v readily attack halogenated compounds r x e g cip as shown in reaction 9 and causes their degradation 35 the yield of electron from oxidation of cu was estimated through the use of nitrate anion no3 which is a strong scavenger of electron e as shown in reaction 10 34 the use of no3 declined the degradation of cip by cu fig s2 supporting information no3 reacts at high rate with eaq and retard its reactivity with cip the decreased cip degradation by cu in the presence of no3 suggest that cu is oxidized into e 9 e a q r x x r 10 n o 3 e a q n o 3 2 k 9 8 10 9 m 1 s 1 other possible reason causing the removal of cip by cu0 include the contact between cip molecules and surface of the copper 36 38 the high bet surface area suggest greater accumulation of cip molecules on the surface of cu0 which consequently led to optimum removal of cip 3 3 effects of h2o2 cu0 and cip initial concentrations 3 3 1 effect of h2o2 0 since addition of h2o2 to cu accelerated degradation of cip due to formation of oh thus increase in h2o2 0 is expected to promote the rate of formation of oh and consequently improve degradation of cip thus in this study h2o2 initial concentrations were varied from 20 to 160 ppm and kept constant cu 0 0 5 g l and cip 0 10 ppm the raise in h2o2 0 significantly promoted cip degradation and was found to be 53 at h2o2 0 40 ppm and 83 at h2o2 0 160 ppm after 80 min of reaction fig 3a the increase in h2o2 0 increase the rate of formation of oh and consequently promote target contaminant degradation 39 3 3 2 effect of cu 0 since cu catalyze h2o2 into oh thus the use of high level of cu 0 could promote the yield of oh and consequently improve removal efficiency of cip thus different level of cu 0 i e 0 25 2 0 g l was employed to treat cip solutions under constant cip 0 10 ppm and h2o2 0 40 ppm the high level of cu promoted the removal efficiency of cip and was found to be 56 at cu 0 0 25 g l and 87 at cu 0 2 0 g l after 80 min treatment fig 3b the prompt removal efficiency of cip at high level of cu 0 could be due to the enhanced decomposition of h2o2 and consequently high rate of formation of oh the results achieved were consistent to the trend observed in previous studies 13 35 39 other possible reasons for the prompt removal efficiency of cip at high level of cu 0 could be the availability of maximum adsorption sites 12 19 40 41 3 3 3 effect of cip 0 the use of cu mediated h2o2 based technologies was also investigated to treat different concentrations of the target contaminant different initial concentrations of cip ranging from 2 5 20 ppm were used while keeping constant levels of cu 0 0 5 g l and h2o2 0 40 ppm the use of high concentrations of cip declined the removal of cip and was found to be 43 at cip 0 20 ppm and 85 at cip 0 2 5 ppm at 80 min reaction times fig 3c similar trends have been reported in previous studies too 12 13 42 the most possible reasons for the decrease in removal efficiency of cip at its high concentration include a increase in the number of cip and consequent reduction in the ratio of oh to cip molecules b increase in the concentrations of dps with elevating cip 0 and consequently greater competition between cip and dps for oh and c competition between cip and its dps for adsorption sites of cu 0 that is expected to be higher at high concentrations of cip 12 13 42 besides removal efficiency of cip the degradation rate defined as the change in concentration of the target contaminant per unit time Î¼m min was calculated for all the studied concentrations at 20 min the increase in cip 0 resulted in high degradation rate of cip data not shown the availability of maximum number of cip molecules exposed to reactive radicals at high cip 0 can be the possible reason for high degradation rate at high cip 0 22 3 4 effects of ph and inorganic ions 3 4 1 ph it has been reported that catalytic degradation of the target contaminants by zerovalent metals mediated peroxide based degradation is greatly influenced by ph of aqueous solution 12 19 the possible reasons are the variation in the electronic charge on the surface of the catalysts and contaminants variation in oxidation potential of oh and influence on the activity of the catalyst 43 45 in the present study thus removal of cip by cu0 mediated h2o2 based degradation was investigated at different ph of aqueous solutions i e ph 3 11 2 the cu0 mediated h2o2 based process resulted in cip removal of 85 at ph 8 0 78 at ph 5 8 69 at ph 3 0 and 53 at ph 11 2 fig 4 the point of zero charge of cu0 has been reported to be 8 2 which suggest negatively charged surface of cu0 at ph 8 2 and positively charged at ph 8 2 46 the pka values of cip i e 6 0 and 8 5 suggest that cip surface bear positive charge at ph 6 0 and negative charge at ph 8 5 the high removal of cip at ph 8 0 looked to be due to neutral nature of both cu0 and cip resulting into maximum accumulation of cip molecules on the surface of cu0 also the weak alkaline conditions enhance the yield of oh the decline in removal efficiency of cip at acidic and highly alkaline ph could be due to the repulsive interaction between cip and cu0 as both the catalyst and cip bears identical charges at acidic and highly alkaline ph the removal of cip was inhibited to less extent than that at high alkaline ph possible due to rapid corrosion of zerovalent metal at acidc ph and ease oxidation 12 other reason for the low removal of cip at high alkaline ph looked be the decrease in oxidation potential of oh 22 3 4 2 inorganic ions presence inorganic ions are main constituents of natural water and are reported to react rapidly with oh and consequently affect reactivity of oh with target contaminants 12 22 besides these ions compete with cip molecules to adsorb on the surface of cu0 thus effects of selected inorganic anions found in natural water were investigated on cu0 h2o2 mediated degradation of cip table 1 the addition of ions influenced the degradation of cip in the order of no2 co3 2 hco3 cu cl fe2 no3 table 1 the fast reactivity of no2 with oh as shown in reaction 11 possibly greatly restrained the reactivity of oh with cip and consequently caused more inhibition in cip degradation 32 34 the addition of co3 2 and hco3 to an aqueous cip solution treated with cu0 h2o2 also caused greater inhibition in cip degradation and the possible reasons looked to be the fast reactivity of co3 2 and hco3 with oh as shown in reactions 12 and 13 12 17 34 other possible reason looked to be the boost in ph of aqueous solution due to both co3 2 and hco3 and high ph was found to retard catalytic degradation of cip the catalytic degradation of cip by cu0 h2o2 was comparatively less restrained by cu fe2 and cl though these ions have very fast kinetics with oh reaction 14 16 in the case of cu and fe2 the possible reasons looked to be the catalytic role of cu in decomposition of h2o2 into oh 19 47 similarly cl react with oh and form reactive species i e cloh and cl reactions 16 and 17 which are reported to be involved in the degradation of target contaminants 17 19 34 the removal of cip by cu0 h2o2 was inhibited to minimal level by no3 which was possible due to slower reactivity of the later with oh and was consistent with the trend observed in previous studies 12 17 11 o h n o 2 o h n o 2 k 8 1 10 9 m 1 s 1 12 o h c o 3 2 o h c o 3 k 4 1 10 8 m 1 s 1

5 m 1 s 1 3 5 toc removal of cip to accurately monitor potential of the treatment technologies in mass reduction of the toxic organic pollutants removal of toc by cu h2o2 was evaluated 48 49 the toc removal of cip was 30 at 105 min of treatment however toc removal was promoted to 78 at 800 min treatment in the presence of high concentrations cu and h2o2 fig 5 the prompt toc removal at high treatment time and high concentrations of catalyst and peroxide was because that toc removal is a complex and multistep process and might involve formation of persistent intermediate products 12 48 the high toc removal depicts that cu h2o2 have great potential in the remediation of toxic organic pollutants 3 6 proposed degradation pathways of cip the oh mediated degradation of cip resulted into several organic and inorganic dps the organic dps were analyzed using uplc ms ms scheme 1 based on the interpretation of mass spectra of the dps as shown in fig s3 a c in supporting information the inorganic products were analyzed through ic the organic dps were not quantified successfully due to non availability of authentic standards of the dps the first dp reported herein as dp1 as shown in pathway i was formed through h abstraction by oh and was reported in previous study too 50 51 the oh attack dp1 and transfer it into dp2 following decarboxylation reaction the formation of dp3 was found due to the replacement of f by oh and was reported in previous study too 12 the attack of oh on the n of piperazine ring involving electron abstraction form first aminium radical cation and then dp4 through the loss of ethylene group 13 51 the attack of oh on n of dp4 form first aminium radical cation then undergo loss of ethylamine and form dp5 13 the dp6 shown in pathway ii is formed from the oh at the side piperazine ring following abstraction of electron then formation of aminium radical cation and finally loss of ethylene group 13 the dp6 transform into dp7 with the further attack of oh and loss of ethylamine the attack of oh involving h abstraction from the c bearing double bond form oh derivative that undergo decarboxylation and form dp8 the oxidation of nh2 into no2 group transform the dp8 into dp9 and was reported in previous study too 12 the ic analysis showed formation of inorganic ionic products no3 ch3co2 and f from the degradation of cip by cu0 h2o2 the loss of these inorganic products from cip suggest high potential of the treatment technology for remediation of cip 3 7 ecotoxicity evaluation of cip and its dps the study of ecotoxicity evaluation is important to assess potential and removal efficacy of the cu0 h2o2 for treating cip in the present study ecotoxicities in term of acute and or chronic toxicities of cip and its dps were estimated towards fish green algae and daphnia using the chinese hazard evaluation criteria and european union guidelines as described in our previous publications 12 19 the results as shown in table 2 depict the parent compound cip to be non toxic however most of the dps showed high toxicities the generation of toxic dps from degradation of cip by cu h2o2 provide future perspective for researchers to look into the toxicities of organic pollutants as well as their dps the formation of acetate reported to be non toxic suggest the end products to be non toxic and suggest high potential of the treatment technology 4 conclusions in the present study highly stable crystalline mesoporous nano sized and efficient cu0 was synthesized by borohydride based chemical reduction method using mixture of ethanol and water as the precursor solvent the synthesized cu0 proved to be highly effective in the degradation of cip and decomposition of h2o2 into oh the oh played vital role in the degradation of cip and role of oh was influenced by radical scavengers concentrations of h2o2 and cu0 ph 0 and use of co existing inorganic ions degradation pathways of cip were established based on the investigation of dps of cip by uplc ms ms and ic analyses the dps analyzed showed high toxicities than cip which open new windows for researchers to investigate toxicities of dps along with parent organic pollutants the evolution of inorganic dps and formation of non toxic acetate suggest the viable potential of cu0 h2o2 in remediation and detoxification of cip declaration of competing interest authors do not have

13879,this study investigated the application of an up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor followed by a self aerated sponge sas unit as a combined system for the treatment of hazardous landfill leachate hll for 310 days the removal efficiencies of the integrated uasb sas system were 34 5 59 2 for cod total 19 6 50 8 for cod soluble 72 3 92 8 for nh4 n 41 3 58 6 for tss and 32 9 49 4 for vss the removal efficiencies of polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs i e pcb 44 pcb 118 pcb 149 pcb 180 and pcb 194 were 88 1 94 2 87 2 95 7 and 91 2 respectively resulting in Ïpcbs of 0 019 Î¼g l in the treated effluent the highest heavy metals removal efficiencies were 85 6 4 8 73 6 5 4 87 6 6 2 76 5 3 8 77 8 4 0 42 9 1 9 59 3 4 5 and 80 6 4 5 for fe2 zn2 cu2 ni2 cd2 pb2 cr3 and mn2 respectively the performance of the treatment system was found to be hydraulic retention time hrt salinity and c n ratio dependent the profile analysis along the sas height revealed that the cod fractions cod total cod soluble and cod particulate were initially consumed followed by the nitrification process an initial investment of 212 7 us m3 d and an annual cost of 11 3 us m3 d were estimated for the combined uasb sas system treating hll this study provided an environmental eco friendly and feasible sustainable solution for handling the hll issues particularly in developing countries keywords anaerobic aerobic treatment cost estimation hazardous landfill leachate nitrification denitrification toxic pollutants 1 introduction alexandria is the 2nd largest city in egypt and it hosts more than 1900 industrial facilities including chemicals petrochemicals food processing textile construction pharmaceutical metals cement light electronics and paper manufactures the city holds around 40 of the egyptian industrial production accordingly huge amounts of hazardous solid wastes are annually generated causing serious environmental problems which need proper management 1 2 landfilling was acknowledged as a predominant management approach for the disposal of various types of hazardous wastes 3 landfill receive hazardous solid waste from sophisticated industrial activities such as computers mobile phones petroleum and chemical by products although landfilling is simple and requires low maintenance costs it generates highly toxic liquid leachate 4 the hazardous landfill leachate hll comprises a vast array of refractory organics inorganic salts nitrogen species heavy metal ions polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs and diverse mixtures of toxic compounds 5 1 6 the hll composition creates severe potential risks to the receiving environment i e soil plants and water bodies particularly when dumping under an uncontrolled manner 7 2 8 hll also tends to cause adverse human health impacts and deteriorate the ecosystem hence it should be adequately treated however due to its complex and diverse composition hll requires a series of treatment units 9 recently various treatment technologies have been developed and evaluated for the removal of organic inorganic and hazardous contaminants from landfill leachate these techniques was classified into physical e g membrane separation 10 chemical e g advanced oxidation 11 12 physicochemical 13 14 electrochemical 15 16 and biological processes 17 19 amongst them biological treatment via anaerobic degradation followed by a post treatment stage e g aerobic condition has been efficiently employed to handle the high organic strength of the leachate 20 21 the sequential anaerobic aerobic process can also be a reliable solution because it is generally low cost and environmentally compatible 22 23 particularly when the hll contains high levels of volatile fatty acids vfas and biodegradable organics 4 in addition biological treatment can resist the high fluctuation in influent hll and has a high ability to eliminate the nitrogen species via nitrification and denitrification processes 24 10 25 the up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor has gained high acceptance and importance as an ideal techno economic option for the treatment of landfill leachate ll 26 27 the uasb technology has been recognized as a proper and cost effective process for the treatment of ll 28 10 29 it also has several attributes such as high loading capacity low sludge production small space requirements limited nutrients requirement and chemical consumptions 30 the uasb reactor treating ll reduced the 5 day biochemical oxygen demand bod5 concentration to the minimum value of 50 mg l in the treated effluent at organic loading rate olr of 8 0 kgcod m 3 d and cod inf of 8000 mg l 10 cod removal efficiency of 76 was achieved by uasb module treating ll at an hrt of 3 0 days and olr of 1 3 kgcod m3 d 29 a higher soluble cod removal efficiency of 77 91 was obtained by uasb reactor at an olr 0 6 19 7 gcod l d and hrt 12 24 h 31 however the removal of nitrogenous compounds by the uasb reactor is quite low and undoubtedly needs post treatment to produce an effluent quality complying with the allowable regulations 32 35 a self aerated sponge sas tower has been acknowledged to appropriately handle an anaerobically pre treated effluent due to its high ability to eliminate the remaining organic pollutants and achieve the nitrification denitrification process 36 air is naturally diffused inside the sas module from a number of openings positioned along the reactor height providing a sufficient amount of dissolved oxygen do for organics and ammonia oxidation 37 38 the sas unit is packed with an adequate quantity of highly porous polyurethane sponges with a large surface area to allow the growing of various bacterial communities i e oxic and anoxic species 39 the sas unit enjoys long sludge age minimum biomass wastage acceptable degradation of organics self separation of heterotrophic and autotrophic bacteria and inexpensive construction 40 47 the sponge module treating uasb reactor effluent achieved an average removal efficiencies of 52 4 for cod total 51 4 for codsoluble 52 15 for codparticulate and 92 3 6 for ammonia 48 passive aerated immobilized biomass reactor based on sponge media was used for post treatment of fenton process where cod total and nh4 n removal efficiency was dropped from 55 6 33 2 and from 93 8 80 11 at reducing the hrt from 16 to 4 h respectively 49 in this context the sas reactor has been acknowledged as a smart technical solution to meet the required water quality standards particularly in the developing countries however the sas technology has not yet been adopted to polish the anaerobically pre treated hazardous landfill leachate hll regarding variations in hydraulic retention times hrts feed salinity and influent nitrogenous compounds moreover there have been few reports about the performance of uasb and sas systems treating hll containing macro inorganic compounds xenobiotic organics highly chlorinated pcbs congeners and heavy metals hence this work was conducted to investigate the feasibility of combining the sas reactor with the uasb module to withstand the highly concentrated pollutants in the hll source the applicability of using the sas reactor as a stand alone treatment step to eliminate chemical oxygen demand cod fractions cod total cod soluble and cod particulate total suspended solids tss volatile suspended solids vss and ammonia nitrogen nh4 n in hll was also attempted the profile patterns of organic matter retained biomass and nitrification along the sas system height was investigated the ability of the bioreactors to remove hazardous pollutants such as heavy metals and pcbs compounds was conducted a brief economic assessment of the integrated uasb sas system treating hll was performed the findings of this work attempt to assist policymakers researchers public private sectors for finding environmental eco friendly and feasible solutions for the treatment of hll 2 materials and methods 2 1 characteristics of hazardous landfill leachate hll in this investigation the leachate samples were collected twice a week from a hazardous landfill site located in borg el arab city alexandria egypt the landfill site received hazardous wastes from various industries in the alexandria governorate the generated hll was highly concentrated and characterized by recalcitrant organic compounds high ammonia concentration heavy metals and inorganic salts table 1 the major portion of organics was in the soluble form and the vss tss ratio was 0 34 the samples were rich with nitrogenous compounds in terms of tkj n n organic and ammonia moreover the leachate contained polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs due to the disposal of electrical appliances capacitors and transformers 2 2 reactors specification pilot scale up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb and self aerated sponge sas reactors fig 1 were installed and continuously operated at the site for treating hazardous landfill leachate hll the working volume of the uasb reactor was 10 8 l with an internal diameter of 10 cm and a height of 138 cm the uasb unit was initially seeded with anaerobic consortia collected from a thickener tank of a wastewater treatment plant located at alexandria city egypt the inoculum sludge had concentrations of 33 1 g l for total solids ts and 22 3 g l for volatile solids vs where vs ts ratio is equivalent to 0 67 the reactor was inoculated with 6 l sludge which represents 55 4 of the total reactor volume the self aerated sponge sas module had a capacity of 21 l and equipped with sponge media of 7 8 l which represented 38 of the total reactor volume the internal diameter and height of the sas reactor were 15 and 180 cm respectively the reactor consisted of three identical segments connected vertically which were linked in series fig 1 the diffusion of oxygen from the air to the attached bacteria was naturally facilitated through three windows 10 cm each positioned at different levels along the reactor height each segment was randomly equipped with about 2 6 l of polyurethane sponge warped with perforated polypropylene plastic material to avoid any clogging issues and facilitate the oxygen penetration into the attached consortia the sponge piece was cylindrical in shape with 30 mm height and 28 mm diameter the characteristics of packing material were specific surface area 256 m2 m3 density 30 kg m3 voids ratio 0 9 and pore size 0 63 mm 2 3 experimental procedures two main experiments were carried out in this investigation for a total period of 310 days the 1st experiment was conducted to assess the performance of the combined uasb sas system continuously operated at total hrts of 40 20 and 10 h for the treatment of hll for a period of 240 days the uasb reactor was operated under three hrt conditions of 23 0 11 3 and 5 7 h corresponding to organic loading rates olrs of 4 6 6 7 and 11 2 gcod l d respectively to optimize and define its design parameters and efficiency for pre treatment of hll the sas reactor was operated at different hrts of 17 0 8 7 and 4 3 h equivalent to olrs of 5 7 8 2 and 14 6 gcod l d respectively the reduction of hazardous pollutants and the effects of salinity 7 23 g tds l and c n ratio 30 62 on the cod fractions removal and ammonia oxidation were assessed in the 2nd experiment the sas reactor as a stand alone treatment stage was continuously fed with hll and operated at hrt of 17 h and olr not exceeding 5 7 gcod l d for 70 days 2 4 analytical methods the performances of the treatment scenarios were recorded by analyzing the influent and effluents of both uasb and sas reactors in addition the mechanisms of the removal of organic matter ammonia and suspended solids along the height of the sas system were monitored the following analyses were measured ph cod tss vss total vfas nh4 n and total kjeldahl nitrogen tkj n soluble cod was analyzed by filtering the leachate samples through 0 45 Î¼m filters particulate cod was calculated by the difference between codtotal and codsoluble all measurements were performed according to apha 50 extracellular polymeric substances eps were analyzed based on the method described earlier by frÃ¸lund et al 51 the concentrations of heavy metal ions cu2 mn2 fe2 zn2 ni2 pb2 cr3 and cd2 were determined using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer model aa 7000 shimadzu japan qualitative and quantitative analysis of the polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs compounds was measured by gas chromatography mass spectrometric gc ms device jt baker for gc ms germany sponge pieces were collected squeezed and washed by distilled water to determine the retained biomass concentration the eluted biomass was prepared in porcelain dishes and analyzed for ts and vs contents the methods used for sample preparation and scanning electron microscopy sem analysis were described earlier by tawfik et al 52 3 results and discussion 3 1 results of 1st experiment concerning performance of combined uasb sas system for treatment of hazardous landfill leachate hll at different hrts the time course of cod total fig 2 a cod soluble fig 2b tss fig 2c vss fig 2d nh4 n fig 2e and ph fig 2f were monitored for hll feed uasb effluent and sas effluent for 240 days the combined system was operated at total hrts of 40 20 and 10 h equivalent to uasb and sas hrts of 23 0 and 17 0 h 11 3 and 8 7 h and 5 7 and 4 3 h respectively 3 1 1 cod profiles fig 2 a b demonstrate that the uasb unit attained cod total and cod soluble removal efficiencies of 10 5 23 6 and 8 8 13 7 respectively the unsatisfactory elimination of cod by the uasb reactor could be due to a the presence of metal ions e g cu2 37 4 2 6 mg l mn2 23 6 3 3 mg l and fe2 21 2 1 06 mg l see table 1 which strongly compete with the organic compounds for the available active sites of the sludge bed 53 b the existence of complex and refractory substances that inhibit the bacterial activity for degrading the available substrate 7 and c the negative impact of high salinity on the microbial ability to breakdown the organic pollutants 17 the physical entrapment or accumulation of solid organics within the sludge bed of uasb has also been revealed by uemura and harada 54 this pattern could be followed by the liquefaction of the entrapped organics which are hydrolyzed and converted into soluble components in the uasb reactor effluent this phenomenon complied with the data in fig 2 b in which the effluent cod soluble of the uasb reactor was approximately similar to the influent ones suggesting a generation of soluble compounds such as volatile fatty acids comparable findings were reported by Ã¡lvarez et al 55 who found that the removal efficiency of cod soluble did not exceed 13 for a uasb reactor treating domestic wastewater a maximum cod total removal efficiency of 59 2 4 8 was achieved in the combined system uasb sas operated at a total hrt of 40 h fig 2a accordingly the integration of sas with uasb resulted in a significant enhancement of cod removal under all hrt conditions the major portion of cod total was eliminated by the sas reactor resulting residual value of 1772 323 mg l in the final discharge the elimination of cod via the sas system could be attributed to adsorption entrapment onto the packing material followed by biodegradation 33 the removal efficiency of cod total and cod soluble significantly dropped from 59 2 4 8 34 5 2 8 and from 57 3 3 8 26 6 2 4 respectively at reducing the total hrt from 40 to 10 h hence a long hrt condition provided a positive impact on the removal efficiency of cod by the integrated uasb sas system this finding could be attributed to the sufficient interaction between substrate and consortium bacterium similarly el kamah et al 33 found that the removal efficiency of particulate cod decreased at reducing the hrt from 5 0 to 4 2 h in a down flow hanging sponge dhs reactor treating the anaerobic effluent of onion dehydration wastewater 3 1 2 tss and vss profiles fig 2 c d depict that the uasb reactor attained tss and vss removal efficiencies of 31 1 45 0 and 24 5 37 8 respectively presumably this result revealed the retention and entrapment of the solid matter in the reactor as previously reported by okada et al 26 however the solids removal efficiency was dropped at reducing the hrt condition due to the dilution of the sludge bed and imposed high up flow velocity 56 a previous study by chong et al 57 has also revealed that uasb could be used to reduce the tss load avoiding damages to the subsequent treatment units the long hrt would provide an appropriate interaction between biomass substrate and overcome the formation of gas pockets within the sludge bed which positively affect the tss removal efficiency within the uasb system 24 the application of sas after uasb was able to enhance both tss and vss removals by over 35 the eliminations of tss and vss by the sas reactor could be ascribed to a physical capture of suspended particles by the sponge media during filtration and b biological degradation of volatile organic matter by the attached heterotrophic bacteria 40 furthermore the inadequate tss removal at short hrt within the sas unit could be associated with the increase in the hydrodynamic shear force by water passing through the sponge media 39 under this condition the dispersion and detachment of the retained biomass would be occurred fleifle et al 58 found that the use of sponge packing in a down flow hanging sponge dhs unit treating agricultural drainage water would eliminate about 88 6 of tss mainly removed in the upper part of the reactor however wu et al 9 used a combined biological reactor coagulation and fenton oxidation for the treatment of landfill leachate registering a higher ss removal efficiency of 91 8 3 1 3 ammonia profile fig 2 e shows the nh4 n profile of the integrated uasb sas system treating landfill leachate the nh4 n concentration in the treated effluent of the uasb unit slightly exceeded the influent feed this finding could be illustrated by the ammonification process i e the anaerobic conversion of organic nitrogen into ammonium 30 the sas system was efficient for the removal of residual ammonia from the uasb reactor effluent attaining entire nh4 n removal efficiencies of 92 8 6 0 87 5 8 6 and 72 3 4 8 at total hrts of 40 20 and 10 h respectively the adequate nitrification efficiency of sas could be linked to the presence of a relatively high fraction of nitrifiers within the sponge pores ensuring the mass transfer process of oxygen substrate and nutrients 33 59 3 1 4 ph profile the activity of sulphate reducing bacteria srb for sulfate reduction in uasb could be demonstrated by the production of alkalinity 60 this finding caused an increase in the medium ph from 7 7 0 2 for the leachate feed to 8 2 0 3 for the uasb reactor effluent fig 2f stoltz and greger 61 reported that the increase in solution ph would assist in decreasing the solubility of heavy metals i e a condition that reduces the toxicity of hll however the slight increase in the solution ph over 6 8 7 2 i e the optimum range for methanogenic cells could contribute to the decrease in the uasb performance for organic matter removal as shown in fig 2 a b 3 1 5 hazardous pollutants removal polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs consist of various chlorinated organic compounds i e pcb congeners forming a toxic chemical group with the formula of c12h10 ncln they are highly persistent and potentially carcinogenic compounds that can cause a variety of adverse health effects fig 3 a depicts that the uasb reactor achieved a removal efficiency of 52 4 for 2 2 3 5 tetrachlorobiphenyl 66 7 for 2 3 4 4 5 pentachlorobiphenyl 61 5 for 2 2 3 4 5 6 hexachlorobiphenyl 78 7 for 2 2 3 4 4 5 5 heptachlorobiphenyl and 73 7 for 2 2 3 3 4 4 5 5 octachlorobiphenyl the application of the aerobic sas reactor contributed to a further reduction of pcbs fig 3b accordingly the removals of pcb 44 pcb 118 pcb 149 pcb 180 and pcb 194 were enhanced by 68 2 41 2 41 7 21 6 and 23 8 respectively using the integrated uasb sas system fig 3c the initial anaerobic phase tends to convert the highly chlorinated pcb congeners e g tetra penta and hexa chlorobiphenyls into lower chlorinated congeners following eq 1 62 this pattern would increase the mono and di chlorobiphenyls containing a low number of chlorine atoms in the molecule the lower and moderately chlorinated congeners become readily degraded as substrates by the aerobic bacterial consortium in the sas stage 1 r cl 2e h r h cl the elimination of heavy metals from leachate is also an essential task as they impose various negative impacts on human health and the ecosystem the data listed in table 2 depict that the uasb unit was able to eliminate an adequate portion of heavy metals found in hll for instance the removal efficiencies of cu2 mn2 fe2 and zn2 by uasb within 23 0 h were 49 4 3 4 49 5 2 8 47 5 1 4 and 47 3 2 1 respectively the main mechanisms of metal ions removal could be defined as a physico chemical interaction and complexation with extracellular polymeric substances 32 8 mg eps gvs at hrt of 23 0 h having negatively charged functional groups 63 b formation of insoluble metal sulfide precipitates 28 c adsorption onto the solid medium either biomass or inert particulate matter and d complexation with intermediate compounds produced during digestion process the average sulfate so4 2 concentration in the hll feed amounted to 142 6 22 8 mg l which was anaerobically reduced into hydrogen sulfide ion hs of 88 7 12 6 mg l using sulfate reducing bacteria srb the conversion of sulfate into sulfide was accompanied by the formation of insoluble metal sulfide precipitates as shown in eqs 2 and 3 64 2 organic substrate electron donor so4 2 electron acceptor hs hco3 3 me2 hs mes h these metal sulfide complexes e g cds cus fes pbs mns hgs nis and zns are stable and they tend to precipitate onto the sludge bed of the uasb reactor likely qian et al 65 found that the removal of cr vi by the uasb reactor could follow a sorption onto either microorganisms or organic substrates b biological reduction of cr vi to cr iii via bacterial metabolism and c sulfate reduction to sulfide used for the abiotic reduction of cr vi another study reported that the presence of trace metals 200 mg l in the sludge of uasb would accelerate the enzymatic activities and act as a nonspecific inhibitor of acidogenesis 66 the combined uasb sas system attained the highest metal removal efficiencies at a total hrt of 40 h corresponding to 85 6 4 8 73 6 5 4 87 6 6 2 76 5 3 8 77 8 4 0 42 9 1 9 59 3 4 5 and 80 6 4 5 for fe2 zn2 cu2 ni2 cd2 pb2 cr3 and mn2 respectively table 2 these results indicated that the combined system would be a promising approach for the removal of heavy metals although the uasb unit eliminated the major portion of heavy metals the sas bioreactor also contributed to the removal process bio sludge accumulated on the sponge material was a key role for the adsorption of heavy metals where the eps was 81 3 4 9 mg gvs the eps molecules could form chemical bonding or physical entanglement to strengthen the bacterial flocs and protect the microbial community from stress conditions attaining the operational stability of the reactor similar results were obtained by kheradmand et al 20 where a combined anaerobic and activated sludge system treating landfill leachate provided removal efficiencies in the range of 88 8 99 9 for fe2 cu2 mn2 and ni2 3 2 results of complementary experiments studying the impact of salinity and c n ratio on the efficiency of combined uasb sas system treating hazardous landfill leachate fig 4 a depicts that the cod total removal efficiency declined from 72 3 38 4 with increasing the tds concentration from 7 5 to 22 6 g l respectively a similar trend was observed for the cod soluble removal efficiency fig 4b suggesting that the increase in tds provided a negative impact on organics reduction by the uasb sas system the high salinity in landfill leachate exerted a selective pressure on microbial communities causing a change in the bacterial cell structure 17 moreover shi et al 67 found that a high salinity concentration of 14 92 g l adversely affected the performance of a uasb reactor treating pharmaceutical wastewater containing salts similar to the patterns of cod removal the nitrification efficiency was deteriorated by increasing the influent salinity fig 4c this result could be because the osmotic stress resulting from ionic strength tends to reduce the bacterial metabolic activities where the nitrifiers are typically maintained a different ionic strength within their cytoplasm based on their salt level than that found outside the cell however the water tends to flow across the cell membrane towards to the higher slat zone outside the bacterial cells by osmosis phenomena to dilute and eventually equilibrate the inner and outer salt levels resulting excessive shrinking of the bacterial cells and subsequently reduction of bacterial metabolic activities however a slight drop in ammonia removal r 2 0 263 could be associated with the growth of saline resistant species to cope with the environment of high osmotic pressure 68 windey et al 69 indicated that saline resistant aerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria aer aob might develop after an adaptation period with the higher salt concentration this aer aob would convert nh4 to no2 with oxygen as the electron acceptor nitritation cortÃ©s lorenzo et al 70 reported that the nitrification process in a submerged fixed bed bioreactor was inhibited at a salt concentration over 24 1 g of nacl l owing to the disappearance of ammonia monooxygenase subunit a amoa related to nitrosospira fig 4 d e show that the increase in the c n ratio from 31 to 62 caused a slight decline in cod total and cod soluble removal efficiencies from 40 6 to 32 4 and from 41 8 to 23 6 respectively in the combined system an increased c n ratio tends to supply a high amount of organic carbon to the bacterial biomass which utilized the cod content at the feed of leachate this result could be attributed to the availability of an electron donor expressed as a c n ratio and hence the correlation between cod and c n ratio was insignificant p 0 05 on the contrary the nitrification efficiency of the sas module was negatively influenced p 0 05 by increasing the cod nh4 n ratio from 31 to 62 fig 4f this finding could be because the high amount of organics i e high c n ratio attempts to enhance the growth of heterotrophic bacteria which compete with the nitrifying microorganism for the available electron acceptor in the feed 71 hence the nitrification efficiency could be easily deteriorated at a high cod nh4 n ratio similarly mahmoud et al 37 demonstrated an inverse correlation between nitrification efficiency and influent cod via the equation nh4 n removal 13 5 olr kg cod m3 d 114 using a dhs system subjected to municipal wastewater in addition ali et al 44 mentioned that a low c n ratio 2 in the feed wastewater would provide a favorable condition for high abundance and activity of nitrifiers 3 3 results of 2nd experiments assessing the performance of self aerated sponge module for treatment of hll at optimum hrt of 17 h and olr not exceeding 5 7 gcod l d in the current study the major portions of organics and nitrogenous compounds were removed by the sas unit receiving the effluent of the uasb reactor therefore the performance of a stand alone sas system treating hazardous landfill leachate was attempted at optimum hrt of 17 h and olr not exceeding 5 7 gcod l d fig 5 and table 3 3 3 1 cod fractions the sas unit achieved considerable reductions of codtotal 50 7 4 9 codsoluble 51 0 5 0 and codparticulate 46 7 3 5 table 3 these high organic removal efficiencies could be due to bio filtration through the polyurethane packing medium that served two purposes a physical retention of particulate organics by filtration through the sponge matrix and b biological conversion of organic matter by the consortia attached to the sponge surface additionally high secretion of eps in the medium 98 3 4 1 mg g vs would contribute to the biodegradation process the removal efficiencies of cod total cod soluble and cod particulate in the 1st segment were 37 9 3 4 33 2 4 4 and 73 9 8 4 respectively fig 5a the 2nd and 3rd segments provided a small improvement in cod removals although a gradual decrease of the cod concentrations occurred along the sas reactor height a large portion of the organic carbon was eliminated in the upper segment having a high volumetric organic load hatamoto et al 72 signified that the upper zone of the sponge reactor would retain more heterotrophs that tended to consume the organic carbon present in the uasb effluent our results also revealed that an additional sas phase would be essential to maintain the egyptian standards cod 1100 mg l for discharge into the sewerage network 3 3 2 tss and vss the 1st segment of sas reactor was responsible for the removals of both tss and vss components with efficiencies reaching up to 55 8 4 1 and 38 3 6 respectively fig 5b however the performance of tss and vss reductions in the 2nd and 3rd segments remained insignificant p 0 05 this finding could be due to the filtration and or entrapment capture of particulate and volatile solids into the biomass accumulated within the packed sponge material of the upper segment in a comparable study machdar et al 40 reported that the upper part of the sponge unit would retain a higher amount of solids and biomass compared to the lower portion of the module in this context the sas unit would act as an effective post treatment stage for the elimination of organic particles and tss 3 3 3 nitrogen removal the nitrification profile presented in fig 5c implies that nh4 n was mainly consumed in the bottom parts along the flow length of the sas unit this result could be linked to the sufficient amount of dissolved oxygen do in segments 2 3 tending to oxidized ammonia into the nox n components in addition the variation of nh4 n profile along the reactor height could be due to the dominance of ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob in the middle and lower zones 72 moreover the low organic load at the reactor bottom would favor the establishment of nitrifying bacteria feeding on the n substrate the increase in nox n concentration in the bottom part implied that alternating nitrification denitrification was responsible for the entire nitrogen removal this result could also be elucidated because the influent hll was mainly rich with cod in the soluble form which can be utilized as a carbon source by the denitrifying bacteria 73 moreover the autolysis of retained sludge within the sponge media could partially supply the carbon source for the denitrification process 74 3 3 4 self aerated sponge sas entire performance the developed sas unit was able to reduce the organic and nutrient pollutants as well as heavy metals from the leachate as shown in table 3 about 37 9 of cod was eliminated in the 1st segment followed by an additional 12 8 reduction in the subsequent segments resulting in a total of 50 7 cod removal comparable findings were observed for the tss and vss profiles with removal efficiencies of 57 5 6 8 and 49 8 5 5 respectively the elimination of nitrogen species could be achieved owing to the simultaneous nitrification and denitrification process within the lower part of the reactor the interior zone of the sponge piece had lower do levels i e anoxic condition suggesting that no3 acts as an electron acceptor for denitrification according to the sequence in eq 4 4 no3 no2 no g n2o g n2 g the elimination of nitrate from leachate is regarded as a major objective since it is responsible for the eutrophication of surface waters because the no3 concentration in the sas effluent reached up to 42 0 3 1 mg l table 3 an external carbon source could be required to enhance the heterotrophic denitrification process similarly tanikawa et al 74 revealed that the sponge reactor receiving aquaculture effluent succeeded in attaining a single stage nitrification denitrification mechanism via the action of nitrifiers and denitrifiers in the outer aerobic and inner anoxic conditions of the sponge piece the elimination of the cod fractions cod total cod soluble and cod particulate in the 1st segment would facilitate the nitrification process in the following sections accordingly the arrangement of the sas reactor would be equivalent to a plug flow regime in which the organic matter is initially biologically consumed followed by nitrification the increase in do concentration from 0 mg l leachate to 4 6 0 8 mg l in the effluent demonstrated an optimum condition for organic matter removal along with nitrification furthermore the sas unit was able to eliminate heavy metals hampering further toxic and severe problems to the receiving environment the surface precipitation and adsorption of heavy metals such as zn pb and cu by the sponge packing have also been reported by kumar et al 66 biogenic manganese oxide biomnox formed through biomineralization by organisms would also assist in recovering minor metals during wastewater treatment by sponge technology 75 3 3 5 biomass immobilization fig 6 a c show the changes in the biomass accumulation within the sponge pores after operating the sas reactor for 70 days before the experimentations the sponge channels were clean and empty without any biomass inoculation fig 6a after the complementation of experiments the voids appeared with immobilized biomass suggesting the entrapment of particulate pollutants and bacterial cells fig 6b this finding implied higher solids retention by the sponge matrix which might be beneficial compared to other classical media such as gravel and plastic moreover results showed a unique ability to capture the biomass both inside and outside the sponge material fig 6c the sponge pores were partially clogged suggesting no requirement of cleaning backwashing or replacement of the packing sponge material this high durability could be associated with the balance between bacterial growth and decay amounts 39 the biomass retained in sponge declined from 18 3 6 5 gvs l at the 1st segment to 12 1 4 5 gvs l at the 3rd segment equivalent to an average biomass concentration of 16 8 5 5 gvs l throughout the reactor height the excess sludge amounted to 0 4 l d with a vss tss ratio of 0 55 representing a sludge residence time of about 114 days this long period higher than conventional activated sludge systems of about 15 days implied that the excess biomass was almost stabilized with no need of further high cost sludge disposal processes moreover a long sludge age would maintain a favorable condition for the proliferation of the nitrifying bacteria 39 74 leading to a further enhancement of n removal 3 4 sustainable application of uasb sas system landfill leachate has been reported to contain complex and highly toxic pollutants as well as excess amounts of nitrogen constituents the application of uasb as the initial treatment stage provided various advantages due to its ability to receive high loading rates reaching up to 11 2 gcod l d this system can also be simply constructed and operated facilitating long term performance success in developing countries that have low space availability the initial investment of uasb construction work and mechanical and electrical facilities was estimated as 172 4 us m3 d and approximately 3 64 m2 m3 d of land requirement the capital cost of uasb was comparable to that roughly obtained by eq 5 76 5 c c 494 q 0 20 where cc is capital cost us m3 d and q is leachate discharge m3 d the annual operation and maintenance o m cost including manpower energy consumption repair and maintenance and chemical utilization was 8 71 us m3 d this value was approximately similar to the annual o m cost estimated from eq 6 76 6 a c 457 q 0 49 where ac is annual cost us m3 d and q is leachate discharge m3 d the land cost was estimated following eq 7 76 7 l c 10 4 q 0 12 f where lc is cost of land occupied by facilities us m3 d q is leachate discharge m3 d and f is cost of land us m2 the sas unit was used to polish the anaerobically pre treated effluent without the need for either external or mechanical aeration this stage was operated with an approximately energy consumption of 0 13 kw h m3 aeration supply was almost zero the sponge module can be prepared locally using materials available in the market hence the integrated uasb sas system had an initial investment and an annual cost of 212 7 us m3 d and 11 3 us m3 d respectively the prices were estimated based on a power cost calculated at a rate of 0 07 us kwh b annual repair cost calculated as 2 5 of the capital cost and c service life i e life cycle cost of the integrated uasb sas system assumed as 15 years the entire system can be easily monitored by local staff due to the simple operation and maintenance processes including pumping easy handling of stabilized and reduced sludge and cleaning of the mechanical parts this feasible cost could be associated with low requirements of energy consumption sludge handling and nutrients and chemical requirements in addition the lower mechanical and electrical appurtenances compared to the situation of conventional activated sludge systems would add various benefits for the application of the uasb sas technology in developing countries we also suggest the application of an additional post treatment unit such as membrane bioreactor to reach the discharge standards of organics nutrients and refractory compounds and that will be considered in our future research studies 4 conclusions the application of the combined uasb sas system for the treatment of hazardous landfill leachate hll is a promising approach from both the environmental and economic points of view the technology is efficient reliable and could be easily applied in arid and semi arid countries the application of sas after uasb improved the entire treatment performance by about 196 for organics 37 for coarse suspended solids 750 for nh4 n 50 for pcbs and 75 for heavy metals the increase in the salinity of hll within the range of 7 5 22 6 g l of tds significantly p 0 05 deteriorated the cod removal efficiency but provided insignificant p 0 05 effect on the nitrification process the nitrification efficiency of the uasb sas system was negatively influenced by increasing the c n ratio from 31 to 62 the major portions of organic matter cod total cod soluble and cod particulate were removed in the upper segment whereas the nitrogenous compounds were mainly eliminated in the middle and lower zones of sas module the initial investment and the annual cost of the integrated uasb sas system were estimated to be 212 7 us m3 d and 11 3 us

13879,this study investigated the application of an up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor followed by a self aerated sponge sas unit as a combined system for the treatment of hazardous landfill leachate hll for 310 days the removal efficiencies of the integrated uasb sas system were 34 5 59 2 for cod total 19 6 50 8 for cod soluble 72 3 92 8 for nh4 n 41 3 58 6 for tss and 32 9 49 4 for vss the removal efficiencies of polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs i e pcb 44 pcb 118 pcb 149 pcb 180 and pcb 194 were 88 1 94 2 87 2 95 7 and 91 2 respectively resulting in Ïpcbs of 0 019 Î¼g l in the treated effluent the highest heavy metals removal efficiencies were 85 6 4 8 73 6 5 4 87 6 6 2 76 5 3 8 77 8 4 0 42 9 1 9 59 3 4 5 and 80 6 4 5 for fe2 zn2 cu2 ni2 cd2 pb2 cr3 and mn2 respectively the performance of the treatment system was found to be hydraulic retention time hrt salinity and c n ratio dependent the profile analysis along the sas height revealed that the cod fractions cod total cod soluble and cod particulate were initially consumed followed by the nitrification process an initial investment of 212 7 us m3 d and an annual cost of 11 3 us m3 d were estimated for the combined uasb sas system treating hll this study provided an environmental eco friendly and feasible sustainable solution for handling the hll issues particularly in developing countries keywords anaerobic aerobic treatment cost estimation hazardous landfill leachate nitrification denitrification toxic pollutants 1 introduction alexandria is the 2nd largest city in egypt and it hosts more than 1900 industrial facilities including chemicals petrochemicals food processing textile construction pharmaceutical metals cement light electronics and paper manufactures the city holds around 40 of the egyptian industrial production accordingly huge amounts of hazardous solid wastes are annually generated causing serious environmental problems which need proper management 1 2 landfilling was acknowledged as a predominant management approach for the disposal of various types of hazardous wastes 3 landfill receive hazardous solid waste from sophisticated industrial activities such as computers mobile phones petroleum and chemical by products although landfilling is simple and requires low maintenance costs it generates highly toxic liquid leachate 4 the hazardous landfill leachate hll comprises a vast array of refractory organics inorganic salts nitrogen species heavy metal ions polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs and diverse mixtures of toxic compounds 5 1 6 the hll composition creates severe potential risks to the receiving environment i e soil plants and water bodies particularly when dumping under an uncontrolled manner 7 2 8 hll also tends to cause adverse human health impacts and deteriorate the ecosystem hence it should be adequately treated however due to its complex and diverse composition hll requires a series of treatment units 9 recently various treatment technologies have been developed and evaluated for the removal of organic inorganic and hazardous contaminants from landfill leachate these techniques was classified into physical e g membrane separation 10 chemical e g advanced oxidation 11 12 physicochemical 13 14 electrochemical 15 16 and biological processes 17 19 amongst them biological treatment via anaerobic degradation followed by a post treatment stage e g aerobic condition has been efficiently employed to handle the high organic strength of the leachate 20 21 the sequential anaerobic aerobic process can also be a reliable solution because it is generally low cost and environmentally compatible 22 23 particularly when the hll contains high levels of volatile fatty acids vfas and biodegradable organics 4 in addition biological treatment can resist the high fluctuation in influent hll and has a high ability to eliminate the nitrogen species via nitrification and denitrification processes 24 10 25 the up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor has gained high acceptance and importance as an ideal techno economic option for the treatment of landfill leachate ll 26 27 the uasb technology has been recognized as a proper and cost effective process for the treatment of ll 28 10 29 it also has several attributes such as high loading capacity low sludge production small space requirements limited nutrients requirement and chemical consumptions 30 the uasb reactor treating ll reduced the 5 day biochemical oxygen demand bod5 concentration to the minimum value of 50 mg l in the treated effluent at organic loading rate olr of 8 0 kgcod m 3 d and cod inf of 8000 mg l 10 cod removal efficiency of 76 was achieved by uasb module treating ll at an hrt of 3 0 days and olr of 1 3 kgcod m3 d 29 a higher soluble cod removal efficiency of 77 91 was obtained by uasb reactor at an olr 0 6 19 7 gcod l d and hrt 12 24 h 31 however the removal of nitrogenous compounds by the uasb reactor is quite low and undoubtedly needs post treatment to produce an effluent quality complying with the allowable regulations 32 35 a self aerated sponge sas tower has been acknowledged to appropriately handle an anaerobically pre treated effluent due to its high ability to eliminate the remaining organic pollutants and achieve the nitrification denitrification process 36 air is naturally diffused inside the sas module from a number of openings positioned along the reactor height providing a sufficient amount of dissolved oxygen do for organics and ammonia oxidation 37 38 the sas unit is packed with an adequate quantity of highly porous polyurethane sponges with a large surface area to allow the growing of various bacterial communities i e oxic and anoxic species 39 the sas unit enjoys long sludge age minimum biomass wastage acceptable degradation of organics self separation of heterotrophic and autotrophic bacteria and inexpensive construction 40 47 the sponge module treating uasb reactor effluent achieved an average removal efficiencies of 52 4 for cod total 51 4 for codsoluble 52 15 for codparticulate and 92 3 6 for ammonia 48 passive aerated immobilized biomass reactor based on sponge media was used for post treatment of fenton process where cod total and nh4 n removal efficiency was dropped from 55 6 33 2 and from 93 8 80 11 at reducing the hrt from 16 to 4 h respectively 49 in this context the sas reactor has been acknowledged as a smart technical solution to meet the required water quality standards particularly in the developing countries however the sas technology has not yet been adopted to polish the anaerobically pre treated hazardous landfill leachate hll regarding variations in hydraulic retention times hrts feed salinity and influent nitrogenous compounds moreover there have been few reports about the performance of uasb and sas systems treating hll containing macro inorganic compounds xenobiotic organics highly chlorinated pcbs congeners and heavy metals hence this work was conducted to investigate the feasibility of combining the sas reactor with the uasb module to withstand the highly concentrated pollutants in the hll source the applicability of using the sas reactor as a stand alone treatment step to eliminate chemical oxygen demand cod fractions cod total cod soluble and cod particulate total suspended solids tss volatile suspended solids vss and ammonia nitrogen nh4 n in hll was also attempted the profile patterns of organic matter retained biomass and nitrification along the sas system height was investigated the ability of the bioreactors to remove hazardous pollutants such as heavy metals and pcbs compounds was conducted a brief economic assessment of the integrated uasb sas system treating hll was performed the findings of this work attempt to assist policymakers researchers public private sectors for finding environmental eco friendly and feasible solutions for the treatment of hll 2 materials and methods 2 1 characteristics of hazardous landfill leachate hll in this investigation the leachate samples were collected twice a week from a hazardous landfill site located in borg el arab city alexandria egypt the landfill site received hazardous wastes from various industries in the alexandria governorate the generated hll was highly concentrated and characterized by recalcitrant organic compounds high ammonia concentration heavy metals and inorganic salts table 1 the major portion of organics was in the soluble form and the vss tss ratio was 0 34 the samples were rich with nitrogenous compounds in terms of tkj n n organic and ammonia moreover the leachate contained polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs due to the disposal of electrical appliances capacitors and transformers 2 2 reactors specification pilot scale up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb and self aerated sponge sas reactors fig 1 were installed and continuously operated at the site for treating hazardous landfill leachate hll the working volume of the uasb reactor was 10 8 l with an internal diameter of 10 cm and a height of 138 cm the uasb unit was initially seeded with anaerobic consortia collected from a thickener tank of a wastewater treatment plant located at alexandria city egypt the inoculum sludge had concentrations of 33 1 g l for total solids ts and 22 3 g l for volatile solids vs where vs ts ratio is equivalent to 0 67 the reactor was inoculated with 6 l sludge which represents 55 4 of the total reactor volume the self aerated sponge sas module had a capacity of 21 l and equipped with sponge media of 7 8 l which represented 38 of the total reactor volume the internal diameter and height of the sas reactor were 15 and 180 cm respectively the reactor consisted of three identical segments connected vertically which were linked in series fig 1 the diffusion of oxygen from the air to the attached bacteria was naturally facilitated through three windows 10 cm each positioned at different levels along the reactor height each segment was randomly equipped with about 2 6 l of polyurethane sponge warped with perforated polypropylene plastic material to avoid any clogging issues and facilitate the oxygen penetration into the attached consortia the sponge piece was cylindrical in shape with 30 mm height and 28 mm diameter the characteristics of packing material were specific surface area 256 m2 m3 density 30 kg m3 voids ratio 0 9 and pore size 0 63 mm 2 3 experimental procedures two main experiments were carried out in this investigation for a total period of 310 days the 1st experiment was conducted to assess the performance of the combined uasb sas system continuously operated at total hrts of 40 20 and 10 h for the treatment of hll for a period of 240 days the uasb reactor was operated under three hrt conditions of 23 0 11 3 and 5 7 h corresponding to organic loading rates olrs of 4 6 6 7 and 11 2 gcod l d respectively to optimize and define its design parameters and efficiency for pre treatment of hll the sas reactor was operated at different hrts of 17 0 8 7 and 4 3 h equivalent to olrs of 5 7 8 2 and 14 6 gcod l d respectively the reduction of hazardous pollutants and the effects of salinity 7 23 g tds l and c n ratio 30 62 on the cod fractions removal and ammonia oxidation were assessed in the 2nd experiment the sas reactor as a stand alone treatment stage was continuously fed with hll and operated at hrt of 17 h and olr not exceeding 5 7 gcod l d for 70 days 2 4 analytical methods the performances of the treatment scenarios were recorded by analyzing the influent and effluents of both uasb and sas reactors in addition the mechanisms of the removal of organic matter ammonia and suspended solids along the height of the sas system were monitored the following analyses were measured ph cod tss vss total vfas nh4 n and total kjeldahl nitrogen tkj n soluble cod was analyzed by filtering the leachate samples through 0 45 Î¼m

concerning performance of combined uasb sas system for treatment of hazardous landfill leachate hll at different hrts the time course of cod total fig 2 a cod soluble fig 2b tss fig 2c vss fig 2d nh4 n fig 2e and ph fig 2f were monitored for hll feed uasb effluent and sas effluent for 240 days the combined system was operated at total hrts of 40 20 and 10 h equivalent to uasb and sas hrts of 23 0 and 17 0 h 11 3 and 8 7 h and 5 7 and 4 3 h respectively 3 1 1 cod profiles fig 2 a b demonstrate that the uasb unit attained cod total and cod soluble removal efficiencies of 10 5 23 6 and 8 8 13 7 respectively the unsatisfactory elimination of cod by the uasb reactor could be due to a the presence of metal ions e g cu2 37 4 2 6 mg l mn2 23 6 3 3 mg l and fe2 21 2 1 06 mg l see table 1 which strongly compete with the organic compounds for the available active sites of the sludge bed 53 b the existence of complex and refractory substances that inhibit the bacterial activity for degrading the available substrate 7 and c the negative impact of high salinity on the microbial ability to breakdown the organic pollutants 17 the physical entrapment or accumulation of solid organics within the sludge bed of uasb has also been revealed by uemura and harada 54 this pattern could be followed by the liquefaction of the entrapped organics which are hydrolyzed and converted into soluble components in the uasb reactor effluent this phenomenon complied with the data in fig 2 b in which the effluent cod soluble of the uasb reactor was approximately similar to the influent ones suggesting a generation of soluble compounds such as volatile fatty acids comparable findings were reported by Ã¡lvarez et al 55 who found that the removal efficiency of cod soluble did not exceed 13 for a uasb reactor treating domestic wastewater a maximum cod total removal efficiency of 59 2 4 8 was achieved in the combined system uasb sas operated at a total hrt of 40 h fig 2a accordingly the integration of sas with uasb resulted in a significant enhancement of cod removal under all hrt conditions the major portion of cod total was eliminated by the sas reactor resulting residual value of 1772 323 mg l in the final discharge the elimination of cod via the sas system could be attributed to adsorption entrapment onto the packing material followed by biodegradation 33 the removal efficiency of cod total and cod soluble significantly dropped from 59 2 4 8 34 5 2 8 and from 57 3 3 8 26 6 2 4 respectively at reducing the total hrt from 40 to 10 h hence a long hrt condition provided a positive impact on the removal efficiency of cod by the integrated uasb sas system this finding could be attributed to the sufficient interaction between substrate and consortium bacterium similarly el kamah et al 33 found that the removal efficiency of particulate cod decreased at reducing the hrt from 5 0 to 4 2 h in a down flow hanging sponge dhs reactor treating the anaerobic effluent of onion dehydration wastewater 3 1 2 tss and vss profiles fig 2 c d depict that the uasb reactor attained tss and vss removal efficiencies of 31 1 45 0 and 24 5 37 8 respectively presumably this result revealed the retention and entrapment of the solid matter in the reactor as previously reported by okada et al 26 however the solids removal efficiency was dropped at reducing the hrt condition due to the dilution of the sludge bed and imposed high up flow velocity 56 a previous study by chong et al 57 has also revealed that uasb could be used to reduce the tss load avoiding damages to the subsequent treatment units the long hrt would provide an appropriate interaction between biomass substrate and overcome the formation of gas pockets within the sludge bed which positively affect the tss removal efficiency within the uasb system 24 the application of sas after uasb was able to enhance both tss and vss removals by over 35 the eliminations of tss and vss by the sas reactor could be ascribed to a physical capture of suspended particles by the sponge media during filtration and b biological degradation of volatile organic matter by the attached heterotrophic bacteria 40 furthermore the inadequate tss removal at short hrt within the sas unit could be associated with the increase in the hydrodynamic shear force by water passing through the sponge media 39 under this condition the dispersion and detachment of the retained biomass would be occurred fleifle et al 58 found that the use of sponge packing in a down flow hanging sponge dhs unit treating agricultural drainage water would eliminate about 88 6 of tss mainly removed in the upper part of the reactor however wu et al 9 used a combined biological reactor coagulation and fenton oxidation for the treatment of landfill leachate registering a higher ss removal efficiency of 91 8 3 1 3 ammonia profile fig 2 e shows the nh4 n profile of the integrated uasb sas system treating landfill leachate the nh4 n concentration in the treated effluent of the uasb unit slightly exceeded the influent feed this finding could be illustrated by the ammonification process i e the anaerobic conversion of organic nitrogen into ammonium 30 the sas system was efficient for the removal of residual ammonia from the uasb reactor effluent attaining entire nh4 n removal efficiencies of 92 8 6 0 87 5 8 6 and 72 3 4 8 at total hrts of 40 20 and 10 h respectively the adequate nitrification efficiency of sas could be linked to the presence of a relatively high fraction of nitrifiers within the sponge pores ensuring the mass transfer process of oxygen substrate and nutrients 33 59 3 1 4 ph profile the activity of sulphate reducing bacteria srb for sulfate reduction in uasb could be demonstrated by the production of alkalinity 60 this finding caused an increase in the medium ph from 7 7 0 2 for the leachate feed to 8 2 0 3 for the uasb reactor effluent fig 2f stoltz and greger 61 reported that the increase in solution ph would assist in decreasing the solubility of heavy metals i e a condition that reduces the toxicity of hll however the slight increase in the solution ph over 6 8 7 2 i e the optimum range for methanogenic cells could contribute to the decrease in the uasb performance for organic matter removal as shown in fig 2 a b 3 1 5 hazardous pollutants removal polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs consist of various chlorinated organic compounds i e pcb congeners forming a toxic chemical group with the formula of c12h10 ncln they are highly persistent and potentially carcinogenic compounds that can cause a variety of adverse health effects fig 3 a depicts that the uasb reactor achieved a removal efficiency of 52 4 for 2 2 3 5 tetrachlorobiphenyl 66 7 for 2 3 4 4 5 pentachlorobiphenyl 61 5 for 2 2 3 4 5 6 hexachlorobiphenyl 78 7 for 2 2 3 4 4 5 5 heptachlorobiphenyl and 73 7 for 2 2 3 3 4 4 5 5 octachlorobiphenyl the application of the aerobic sas reactor contributed to a further reduction of pcbs fig 3b accordingly the removals of pcb 44 pcb 118 pcb 149 pcb 180 and pcb 194 were enhanced by 68 2 41 2 41 7 21 6 and 23 8 respectively using the integrated uasb sas system fig 3c the initial anaerobic phase tends to convert the highly chlorinated pcb congeners e g tetra penta and hexa chlorobiphenyls into lower chlorinated congeners following eq 1 62 this pattern would increase the mono and di chlorobiphenyls containing a low number of chlorine atoms in the molecule the lower and moderately chlorinated congeners become readily degraded as substrates by the aerobic bacterial consortium in the sas stage 1 r cl 2e h r h cl the elimination of heavy metals from leachate is also an essential task as they impose various negative impacts on human health and the ecosystem the data listed in table 2 depict that the uasb unit was able to eliminate an adequate portion of heavy metals found in hll for instance the removal efficiencies of cu2 mn2 fe2 and zn2 by uasb within 23 0 h were 49 4 3 4 49 5 2 8 47 5 1 4 and 47 3 2 1 respectively the main mechanisms of metal ions removal could be defined as a physico chemical interaction and complexation with extracellular polymeric substances 32 8 mg eps gvs at hrt of 23 0 h having negatively charged functional groups 63 b formation of insoluble metal sulfide precipitates 28 c adsorption onto the solid medium either biomass or inert particulate matter and d complexation with intermediate compounds produced during digestion process the average sulfate so4 2 concentration in the hll feed amounted to 142 6 22 8 mg l which was anaerobically reduced into hydrogen sulfide ion hs of 88 7 12 6 mg l using sulfate reducing bacteria srb the conversion of sulfate into sulfide was accompanied by the formation of insoluble metal sulfide precipitates as shown in eqs 2 and 3 64 2 organic substrate electron donor so4 2 electron acceptor hs hco3 3 me2 hs mes h these metal sulfide complexes e g cds cus fes pbs mns hgs nis and zns are stable and they tend to precipitate onto the sludge bed of the uasb reactor likely qian et al 65 found that the removal of cr vi by the uasb reactor could follow a sorption onto either microorganisms or organic substrates b biological reduction of cr vi to cr iii via bacterial metabolism and c sulfate reduction to sulfide used for the abiotic reduction of cr vi another study reported that the presence of trace metals 200 mg l in the sludge of uasb would accelerate the enzymatic activities and act as a nonspecific inhibitor of acidogenesis 66 the combined uasb sas system attained the highest metal removal efficiencies at a total hrt of 40 h corresponding to 85 6 4 8 73 6 5 4 87 6 6 2 76 5 3 8 77 8 4 0 42 9 1 9 59 3 4 5 and 80 6 4 5 for fe2 zn2 cu2 ni2 cd2 pb2 cr3 and mn2 respectively table 2 these results indicated that the combined system would be a promising approach for the removal of heavy metals although the uasb unit eliminated the major portion of heavy metals the sas bioreactor also contributed to the removal process bio sludge accumulated on the sponge material was a key role for the adsorption of heavy metals where the eps was 81 3 4 9 mg gvs the eps molecules could form chemical bonding or physical entanglement to strengthen the bacterial flocs and protect the microbial community from stress conditions attaining the operational stability of the reactor similar results were obtained by kheradmand et al 20 where a combined anaerobic and activated sludge system treating landfill leachate provided removal efficiencies in the range of 88 8 99 9 for fe2 cu2 mn2 and ni2 3 2 results of complementary experiments studying the impact of salinity and c n ratio on the efficiency of combined uasb sas system treating hazardous landfill leachate fig 4 a depicts that the cod total removal efficiency declined from 72 3 38 4 with increasing the tds concentration from 7 5 to 22 6 g l respectively a similar trend was observed for the cod soluble removal efficiency fig 4b suggesting that the increase in tds provided a negative impact on organics reduction by the uasb sas system the high salinity in landfill leachate exerted a selective pressure on microbial communities causing a change in the bacterial cell structure 17 moreover shi et al 67 found that a high salinity concentration of 14 92 g l adversely affected the performance of a uasb reactor treating pharmaceutical wastewater containing salts similar to the patterns of cod removal the nitrification efficiency was deteriorated by increasing the influent salinity fig 4c this result could be because the osmotic stress resulting from ionic strength tends to reduce the bacterial metabolic activities where the nitrifiers are typically maintained a different ionic strength within their cytoplasm based on their salt level than that found outside the cell however the water tends to flow across the cell membrane towards to the higher slat zone outside the bacterial cells by osmosis phenomena to dilute and eventually equilibrate the inner and outer salt levels resulting excessive shrinking of the bacterial cells and subsequently reduction of bacterial metabolic activities however a slight drop in ammonia removal r 2 0 263 could be associated with the growth of saline resistant species to cope with the environment of high osmotic pressure 68 windey et al 69 indicated that saline resistant aerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria aer aob might develop after an adaptation period with the higher salt concentration this aer aob would convert nh4 to no2 with oxygen as the electron acceptor nitritation cortÃ©s lorenzo et al 70 reported that the nitrification process in a submerged fixed bed bioreactor was inhibited at a salt concentration over 24 1 g of nacl l owing to the disappearance of ammonia monooxygenase subunit a amoa related to nitrosospira fig 4 d e show that the increase in the c n ratio from 31 to 62 caused a slight decline in cod total and cod soluble removal efficiencies from 40 6 to 32 4 and from 41 8 to 23 6 respectively in the combined system an increased c n ratio tends to supply a high amount of organic carbon to the bacterial biomass which utilized the cod content at the feed of leachate this result could be attributed to the availability of an electron donor expressed as a c n ratio and hence the correlation between cod and c n ratio was insignificant p 0 05 on the contrary the nitrification efficiency of the sas module was negatively influenced p 0 05 by increasing the cod nh4 n ratio from 31 to 62 fig 4f this finding could be because the high amount of organics i e high c n ratio attempts to enhance the growth of heterotrophic bacteria which compete with the nitrifying microorganism for the available electron acceptor in the feed 71 hence the nitrification efficiency could be easily deteriorated at a high cod nh4 n ratio similarly mahmoud et al 37 demonstrated an inverse correlation between nitrification efficiency and influent cod via the equation nh4 n removal 13 5 olr kg cod m3 d 114 using a dhs system subjected to municipal wastewater in addition ali et al 44 mentioned that a low c n ratio 2 in the feed wastewater would provide a favorable condition for high abundance and activity of nitrifiers 3 3 results of 2nd experiments assessing the performance of self aerated sponge module for treatment of hll at optimum hrt of 17 h and olr not exceeding 5 7 gcod l d in the current study the major portions of organics and nitrogenous compounds were removed by the sas unit receiving the effluent of the uasb reactor therefore the performance of a stand alone sas system treating hazardous landfill leachate was attempted at optimum hrt of 17 h and olr not exceeding 5 7 gcod l d fig 5 and table 3 3 3 1 cod fractions the sas unit achieved considerable reductions of codtotal 50 7 4 9 codsoluble 51 0 5 0 and codparticulate 46 7 3 5 table 3 these high organic removal efficiencies could be due to bio filtration through the polyurethane packing medium that served two purposes a physical retention of particulate organics by filtration through the sponge matrix and b biological conversion of organic matter by the consortia attached to the sponge surface additionally high secretion of eps in the medium 98 3 4 1 mg g vs would contribute to the biodegradation process the removal efficiencies of cod total cod soluble and cod particulate in the 1st segment were 37 9 3 4 33 2 4 4 and 73 9 8 4 respectively fig 5a the 2nd and 3rd segments provided a small improvement in cod removals although a gradual decrease of the cod concentrations occurred along the sas reactor height a large portion of the organic carbon was eliminated in the upper segment having a high volumetric organic load hatamoto et al 72 signified that the upper zone of the sponge reactor would retain more heterotrophs that tended to consume the organic carbon present in the uasb effluent our results also revealed that an additional sas phase would be essential to maintain the egyptian standards cod 1100 mg l for discharge into the sewerage network 3 3 2 tss and vss the 1st segment of sas reactor was responsible for the removals of both tss and vss components with efficiencies reaching up to 55 8 4 1 and 38 3 6 respectively fig 5b however the performance of tss and vss reductions in the 2nd and 3rd segments remained insignificant p 0 05 this finding could be due to the filtration and or entrapment capture of particulate and volatile solids into the biomass accumulated within the packed sponge material of the upper segment in a comparable study machdar et al 40 reported that the upper part of the sponge unit would retain a higher amount of solids and biomass compared to the lower portion of the module in this context the sas unit would act as an effective post treatment stage for the elimination of organic particles and tss 3 3 3 nitrogen removal the nitrification profile presented in fig 5c implies that nh4 n was mainly consumed in the bottom parts along the flow length of the sas unit this result could be linked to the sufficient amount of dissolved oxygen do in segments 2 3 tending to oxidized ammonia into the nox n components in addition the variation of nh4 n profile along the reactor height could be due to the dominance of ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob in the middle and lower zones 72 moreover the low organic load at the reactor bottom would favor the establishment of nitrifying bacteria feeding on the n substrate the increase in nox n concentration in the bottom part implied that alternating nitrification denitrification was responsible for the entire nitrogen removal this result could also be elucidated because the influent hll was mainly rich with cod in the soluble form which can be utilized as a carbon source by the denitrifying bacteria 73 moreover the autolysis of retained sludge within the sponge media could partially supply the carbon source for the denitrification process 74 3 3 4 self aerated sponge sas entire performance the developed sas unit was able to reduce the organic and nutrient pollutants as well as heavy metals from the leachate as shown in table 3 about 37 9 of cod was eliminated in the 1st segment followed by an additional 12 8 reduction in the subsequent segments resulting in a total of 50 7 cod removal comparable findings were observed for the tss and vss profiles with removal efficiencies of 57 5 6 8 and 49 8 5 5 respectively the elimination of nitrogen species could be achieved owing to the simultaneous nitrification and denitrification process within the lower part of the reactor the interior zone of the sponge piece had lower do levels i e anoxic condition suggesting that no3 acts as an electron acceptor for denitrification according to the sequence in eq 4 4 no3 no2 no g n2o g n2 g the elimination of nitrate from leachate is regarded as a major objective since it is responsible for the eutrophication of surface waters because the no3 concentration in the sas effluent reached up to 42 0 3 1 mg l table 3 an external carbon source could be required to enhance the heterotrophic denitrification process similarly tanikawa et al 74 revealed that the sponge reactor receiving aquaculture effluent succeeded in attaining a single stage nitrification denitrification mechanism via the action of nitrifiers and denitrifiers in the outer aerobic and inner anoxic conditions of the sponge piece the elimination of the cod fractions cod total cod soluble and cod particulate in the 1st segment would facilitate the nitrification process in the following sections accordingly the arrangement of the sas reactor would be equivalent to a plug flow regime in which the organic matter is initially biologically consumed followed by nitrification the increase in do concentration from 0 mg l leachate to 4 6 0 8 mg l in the effluent demonstrated an optimum condition for organic matter removal along with nitrification furthermore the sas unit was able to eliminate heavy metals hampering further toxic and severe problems to the receiving environment the surface precipitation and adsorption of heavy metals such as zn pb and cu by the sponge packing have also been reported by kumar et al 66 biogenic manganese oxide biomnox formed through biomineralization by organisms would also assist in recovering minor metals during wastewater treatment by sponge technology 75 3 3 5 biomass immobilization fig 6 a c show the changes in the biomass accumulation within the sponge pores after operating the sas reactor for 70 days before the experimentations the sponge channels were clean and empty without any biomass inoculation fig 6a after the complementation of experiments the voids appeared with immobilized biomass suggesting the entrapment of particulate pollutants and bacterial cells fig 6b this finding implied higher solids retention by the sponge matrix which might be beneficial compared to other classical media such as gravel and plastic moreover results showed a unique ability to capture the biomass both inside and outside the sponge material fig 6c the sponge pores were partially clogged suggesting no requirement of cleaning backwashing or replacement of the packing sponge material this high durability could be associated with the balance between bacterial growth and decay amounts 39 the biomass retained in sponge declined from 18 3 6 5 gvs l at the 1st segment to 12 1 4 5 gvs l at the 3rd segment equivalent to an average biomass concentration of 16 8 5 5 gvs l throughout the reactor height the excess sludge amounted to 0 4 l d with a vss tss ratio of 0 55 representing a sludge residence time of about 114 days this long period higher than conventional activated sludge systems of about 15 days implied that the excess biomass was almost stabilized with no need of further high cost sludge disposal processes moreover a long sludge age would maintain a favorable condition for the proliferation of the nitrifying bacteria 39 74 leading to a further enhancement of n removal 3 4 sustainable application of uasb sas system landfill leachate has been reported to contain complex and highly toxic pollutants as well as excess amounts of nitrogen constituents the application of uasb as the initial treatment stage provided various advantages due to its ability to receive high loading rates reaching up to 11 2 gcod l d this system can also be simply constructed and operated facilitating long term performance success in developing countries that have low space availability the initial investment of uasb construction work and mechanical and electrical facilities was estimated as 172 4 us m3 d and approximately 3 64 m2 m3 d of land requirement the capital cost of uasb was comparable to that roughly obtained by eq 5 76 5 c c 494 q 0 20 where cc is capital cost us m3 d and q is leachate discharge m3 d the annual operation and maintenance o m cost including manpower energy consumption repair and maintenance and chemical utilization was 8 71 us m3 d this value was approximately similar to the annual o m cost estimated from eq 6 76 6 a c 457 q 0 49 where ac is annual cost us m3 d and q is leachate discharge m3 d the land cost was estimated following eq 7 76 7 l c 10 4 q 0 12 f where lc is cost of land occupied by facilities us m3 d q is leachate discharge m3 d and f is cost of land us m2 the sas unit was used to polish the anaerobically pre treated effluent without the need for either external or mechanical aeration this stage was operated with an approximately energy consumption of 0 13 kw h m3 aeration supply was almost zero the sponge module can be prepared locally using materials available in the market hence the integrated uasb sas system had an initial investment and an annual cost of 212 7 us m3 d and 11 3 us m3 d respectively the prices were estimated based on a power cost calculated at a rate of 0 07 us kwh b annual repair cost calculated as 2 5 of the capital cost and c service life i e life cycle cost of the integrated uasb sas system assumed as 15 years the entire system can be easily monitored by local staff due to the simple operation and maintenance processes including pumping easy handling of stabilized and reduced sludge and cleaning of the mechanical parts this feasible cost could be associated with low requirements of energy consumption sludge handling and nutrients and chemical requirements in addition the lower mechanical and electrical appurtenances compared to the situation of conventional activated sludge systems would add various benefits for the application of the uasb sas technology in developing countries we also suggest the application of an additional post treatment unit such as membrane bioreactor to reach the discharge standards of organics nutrients and refractory compounds and that will be considered in our future research studies 4 conclusions the application of the combined uasb sas system for the treatment of hazardous landfill leachate hll is a promising approach from both the environmental and economic points of view the technology is efficient reliable and could be easily applied in arid and semi arid countries the application of sas after uasb improved the entire treatment performance by about 196 for organics 37 for coarse suspended solids 750 for nh4 n 50 for pcbs and 75 for heavy metals the increase in the salinity of hll within the range of 7 5 22 6 g l of tds significantly p 0 05 deteriorated the cod removal efficiency but provided insignificant p 0 05 effect on the nitrification process the nitrification efficiency of the uasb sas system was negatively influenced by increasing the c n ratio from 31 to 62 the major portions of organic matter cod total cod soluble and cod particulate were removed in the upper segment whereas the nitrogenous compounds were mainly eliminated in the middle and lower zones of sas module the initial investment and the annual cost of the integrated uasb sas system were estimated to be 212 7 us m3 d and 11 3 us
