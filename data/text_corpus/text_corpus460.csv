2300,continuously increasing the utilization efficiency of agricultural water resources is vital to ensuring future water and food security deficit irrigation di could provide a solution to optimize crop water productivity research on the spatio temporal dynamics of soil water coupled with evapotranspiration partitioning is important for clarifying summer maize zea mays l water utilization characteristics and crop water productivity under different di strategies especially in semi arid regions consequently a three year field experiment with full irrigation ck and eight di treatments t1 t8 comprised of combinations of 100 80 and 60 of crop evapotranspiration was conducted data from large scale weighing lysimeters micro lysimeters and tdr sensors were combined to assess daily root water absorption at different soil depths actual evapotranspiration eta partitioning into plant transpiration t and soil water evaporation e and water use efficiency wue results showed that soil water consumption mainly occurred in the 0 40 cm 0 60 cm and 0 80 cm soil layers during the maize growth stages of planting v6 v6 v12 and v12 r6 respectively water absorption above the 60 cm soil depth accounted for more than 92 of the total water consumption the appropriate irrigation wetting depth for summer maize could be controlled in the top 80 cm layer to avoid deep percolation di affected soil water distribution and availability and thus decreased soil water consumption rate wcr and root water absorption amount under moderate water deficit conditions wcr was rapidly restored to the non water stressed irrigation treatment level and even exceeded that level in the deeper layers after a subsequent irrigation was applied especially in the early maize growth stages e eta was 31 0 32 5 under full irrigation di decreased total soil water evaporation amount but increased the e eta ratio the threshold soil water value for defining when maize was subjected to water stress was 22 0 72 of fc during v3 v12 and 18 0 60 of fc during v12 r1 our results suggest that less water was used in t1 moderate di than with the full irrigation treatment wue increased by 5 5 7 5 as irrigation amount decreased by 12 3 14 5 and yield decreased by 3 3 8 0 these results improve our understanding of maize water consumption characteristics with regard to soil water absorption in different soil layers and evapotranspiration partitioning and provide implications for efficient water management in arid areas of northwest china keywords deficit irrigation soil water consumption evapotranspiration

increasing the utilization efficiency of agricultural water resources is the fundamental means of ensuring future water and food security and has become a global concern kang 2014 more than half of the global agricultural area is facing drought challenges and drought has been a major limiting factor affecting agricultural production in the world liu et al 2022 in china agriculture is the main user of water total water resources are 3160 5 billion m3 and total water consumption is 581 3 billion m3 of which agricultural water accounts for 62 1 of china s total water consumption ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 2021 in the arid and semi arid regions of china insufficient water resources challenge the sustainability of conventional agricultural practices kang et al 2017 an effective way to increase the utilization efficiency of agricultural water resources is the use of deficit irrigation di i e the amount of irrigation water applied is less than the crop water demand at some growth stages costa et al 2007 di could save water and increase water use efficiency of crops while minimizing adverse effects on yield du et al 2010 kang et al 2002 yu et al 2020 zou et al 2021 previous studies of di have mainly focused on crop physiological characteristics evapotranspiration yield and water use efficiency wue costa et al 2007 feng et al 2017 liu et al 2022 mu et al 2021 zou et al 2021 however assessing soil water consumption characteristics at different soil depths and partitioning evapotranspiration into evaporation and transpiration under di have not been systematically investigated further exploring how soil water is consumed and how evapotranspiration partitioning is affected by irrigation application timing and amount is very important for generating deep understanding of maize zea mays l water consumption under di soil water content swc is affected by atmospheric conditions through direct soil water evaporation and vegetation transpiration vereecken et al 2014 plants extract water from soil and root water uptake is responsive to soil water availability wang et al 2020a soil water distribution in the soil profile is determined to a large extent by water uptake when root zone swc decreases below a certain threshold e g 50 of total available water root water uptake can be significantly reduced and plant growth will be restricted liu et al 2022 a previous study has shown that under di swc and its distribution were both affected wang et al 2020a leading to differences in water absorption as maize grows and the root system continues to develop and expand the depth of soil water extraction and the rate of crop water absorption increases yang et al 2018 crop growth stage plays a vital role in decision making related to the use of di zou et al 2021 in spite of this the effects of different levels of reduced irrigation application amounts under di at different growth stages on maize water absorption at different soil depths and the recovery characteristics of maize water absorption in the growth period following the restoration of full irrigation have not been thoroughly investigated previously therefore accurate estimation of soil water absorption characteristics in the maize root zone under different di management strategies is important for determining optimal irrigation wetting depth and proper irrigation management for irrigated agriculture in arid regions crop evapotranspiration et is generally divided into soil water evaporation e and plant transpiration t and is a crucial component in hydrological and ecological processes knowledge of et plays a key role in agricultural irrigation management feng et al 2017 kang et al 2000 in agricultural ecosystems the fractions of e and t in et have been used as indicators of water use efficiency wang et al 2021 in field studies micro lysimeters have been widely used to measure e because they are simple and provide cost effective and reliable measurements kang et al 2003 et can be measured by the combination of sap flow systems and micro lysimeters large weighing lysimeters eddy covariance systems bowen ratio energy balance systems and the soil water balance method wang et al 2021 for example liu et al 2002 used large scale weighing lysimeters and micro lysimeters to monitor daily e and et of winter wheat triticum aestivum l and maize ma et al 2020 used sap flow systems and micro lysimeters to directly measure maize and wheat t and e wang et al 2020d used eddy covariance systems to study et partitioning and crop coefficients for maize in a dry semi humid climate regime the isotope method based on different isotopic compositions of t and e was also used to partition et good et al 2014 soil water content measurements acquired with tdr sensors and soil evaporation measurements made with micro lysimeters are frequently used in the water balance method to monitor and quantify et and e tdr sensers are a promising tool for monitoring soil water content and estimating soil water absorption characteristics in the maize root zone et calculated by the water balance method using tdr sensers coupled soil evaporation measurements made with micro lysimeters have been successfully used to quantify and compare the differences between et and e under various irrigation situations swc and leaf area index lai have been found to be important factors influencing e jiang et al 2016 liu et al 2002 and et has been found to be highly dependent on swc under insufficient irrigation water supply swc and lai are restricted to some extent leading to questions related to how e and e et change under di and what the swc threshold is that results in significantly reduced et assessing the water consumption of each component of et under di could be facilitated by evapotranspiration partitioning the guanzhong plain in the shaanxi province of northwest china is a vital grain production area summer maize and winter wheat are the main crops grown in this area xu et al 2020 therefore a three year di experiment with a range of irrigation amounts applied at different maize growth stages was conducted to determine the spatio temporal dynamics of soil water coupled with evapotranspiration partitioning to clarify maize water consumption characteristics and water productivity under di the objectives of this study were to determine i the spatio temporal dynamics of soil water to assess water consumption in different soil layers during the maize growing season under di ii the soil evaporation and maize transpiration characteristics and et partitioning under di and iii the water consumption characteristics and water productivity of summer maize under di 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the experiment was conducted at the institute of water saving agriculture in arid areas of china 34 20 n 108 04 e elevation 506 m located at yangling in the guanzhong plain of shaanxi province in china fig 1 the mean annual temperature is 12 9 c the mean annual sunshine duration is 2196 h and the frost free period is 213 d during the maize growing seasons of 2018 2019 and 2020 an automatic weather station gmx501 gill instruments ltd uk at the experimental site showed that mean temperatures were 25 9 25 2 and 24 7 c respectively solar radiation values were 170 7 160 5 and 147 8 w m 2 and sunshine duration values were 974 7 953 0 and 849 7 h reference evapotranspiration et0 values estimated with the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 were 536 6 520 5 and 485 8 mm in each of the respective three growing seasons mean temperature solar radiation sunshine duration and et0 were all lowest in 2020 the mean daily temperature solar radiation and et0 during the three experimental years are shown in fig 2 2 2 experimental design the maize variety wuke 2 was grown in this study because it is commonly grown in the region xu et al 2020 zou et al 2021 summer maize was planted at 60 000 plants ha 1 in rows spaced 50 cm apart on 20 june 2018 12 june 2019 and 16 june 2020 with 240 kg n ha 1 and 120 kg p2o5 ha 1 applied at planting four successive phenological periods in the summer maize growing season were identified to study the influence of different irrigation amounts those periods were v3 3 leaf v6 6 leaf v6 v12 12 leaf v12 r1 silking and r1 r6 physiological maturity with the growth stages defined as in ritchie et al 1986 in order to guarantee the water demand of summer maize in the planting v3 period a 50 mm irrigation was applied before planting a partial orthogonal l9 design scheme taguchi method four growth stage factors and three irrigation levels based on the orthogonality selected from a comprehensive test of some representative test points was used for the nine irrigation treatments eight di treatments with three replications of each treatment during 2018 2020 details of the design scheme and irrigation amounts are provided in table 1 and table 2 nine irrigation treatments incorporating three irrigation amounts control or full irrigation ck 100 of maize eta and two levels as a fraction of the control being 80 and 60 of the irrigation amount applied to ck were applied at different growth stages during the growing season the irrigation method was flood irrigation the experiment was conducted in 25 test plots and two large lysimeter plots fig 3 each test plot had dimensions of 3 m 2 2 m 3 m length width and depth respectively and was made of concrete to limit lateral movement of water between adjacent plots the soil in the plot area was homogeneous with the bulk density of 1 35 g cm 3 being silty clay loam as measured by a laser granularity analyzer mastersizer 3000 malvern uk field capacity in the plot was 31 0 as measured by the cutting ring method cutting rings 100 cm3 were used to collect soil samples from the soil surface to the 120 cm depth the soil samples were then saturated excess gravity water was removed and the resulting measured soil water content was considered to be the field capacity two large lysimeters each with a weighing system precision of 139 g i e 0 021 mm of water were used to accurately monitor summer maize evapotranspiration for the ck and t1 treatments a mobile rain shelter was installed over the experimental plots to exclude precipitation details regarding the large lysimeters can be found in yu et al 2016 diagrams of the location of the test plots the large lysimeters and the rain shelter at the experimental site and the structure of the large lysimeters and the test plot structures are shown in fig 3 2 3 sampling and measurements 2 3 1 volumetric soil water content time domain reflectometer tdr sensors tdr 310s acclima inc meridian idaho usa were installed in every test pit total of 25 test pits to accurately measure volumetric soil water content swc throughout the summer maize growing season during 2018 2020 to ensure the accuracy of soil water measurements every tdr 310s sensor was tested and calibrated before installation in order to reduce the influence of soil disturbance on measurement results a vertical section was excavated in every test pit and a sensor was inserted directly into the undisturbed side at each specified depth 10 20 30 40 50 60 80 100 120 160 200 and 240 cm data from 160 200 and 240 cm were not used as the swc changes at 160 cm were minimal fig 3 swc data were logged at 30 minute intervals using a cr6 data logger campbell scientific inc logan utah usa soil water storage sws was calculated as 1 sws i 1 i 9 sw c i h i where sws is the soil water storage mm swc i is the volumetric soil water content at depth i and hi is the depth interval of each soil water measurement mm soil water consumption rate wcr refers to daily rate of soil water consumption reduction at different soil depths it was calculated by the difference in soil moisture over different soil depths 2 3 2 daily evapotranspiration of maize daily evapotranspiration eta for summer maize was calculated using the difference of swc on two successive days in different soil layers as 2 e t a j 1 n h j sw c ji s w c j i 1 where eta mm is the actual et n is the number of soil layers h j is the soil depth mm for the jth soil layer swc ji swc j i 1 are the volumetric soil water contents for the ith and ith 1 days respectively however there is inevitably some bias in using this equation to calculate eta within 1 3 days after an irrigation when downward movement of water beyond 120 cm deep percolation was not be detected by deep sensors especially in the later summer maize growth stages 2 3 3 soil evaporation and plant transpiration twenty seven micro lysimeters were fabricated from polyvinyl chloride tubes with diameter of 11 cm and height of 20 cm the micro lysimeters were placed centered between two crop rows and pushed into the soil to measure daily evaporation e boast and robertson 1982 evaporation measured in this manner can overestimate the evaporation rate of a plot marek et al 2019 as the lysimeter is placed where the density of leaves is lower especially in the early summer maize growth stages when maize canopy cover is low placing the micro lysimeters between two crop rows to measure soil evaporation in farmland has previously been used by many researchers liu et al 2002 ma et al 2020 yu et al 2016 and produced soil water evaporation results within the allowable bias the micro lysimeters were sealed at the bottom placed back into the soil and weighed after a period of 24 h at 18 00 in the evening every day to ensure that the soil moisture content in each micro lysimeter was similar to the actual soil conditions the soil in the micro lysimeters was changed every 4 5 days and changed immediately after each irrigation changes in the weights of the micro lysimeters were assumed to be equivalent to the amount of water evaporated from the soil surface boast and robertson 1982 the sources of error inherent in the micro lysimeter method were discussed and some recommendations for the use of the micro lysimeters were previously made for our study area kang et al 2003 daily soil evaporation and plant transpiration were calculated as 3 e 10 w π r 2 4 t e t a e where e is the daily soil evaporation mm t is plant transpiration mm δw is the weight difference of the micro lysimeter between two successive dates and r is the inner radius cm of the micro lysimeter 2 3 4 leaf area index summer maize leaf area index lai was measured every 7 10 days after emergence three representative maize plants were randomly selected in every plot at each sampling time and the leaf length and maximum leaf width of each leaf were measured using a flexible ruler the leaf area of each leaf was calculated as the product of leaf length maximum leaf width and a coefficient of 0 75 maize lai was calculated using the following equation wang et al 2021 5 lai n p i 1 n i 1 m l i w i 0 75 n a where lai is the leaf area index n p is the number of total maize plants in the test plot n is the number of sampled maize plants 3 m is the number of leaves measured on a plant a is the test plot area m2 and l and w are the length and width m respectively of a measured leaf 2 3 5 water use efficiency the water use efficiency wue of summer maize was calculated as 6 wue y 10 e t a where wue kg m 3 is the water use efficiency of summer maize y kg ha 1 is the maize yield and et a is the total growing season evapotranspiration of maize mm 2 4 statistical analysis a one way analysis of variance anova was used to examine the differences in soil water consumption maize transpiration soil water evaporation evapotranspiration maize yields and wue by using spss statistics 22 0 at a significance level of 0 05 statistically significant comparisons were identified using least significant difference lsd tests 3 results 3 1 soil water storage the sws in the 0 120 cm soil profile for summer maize significantly increased with increasing irrigation amount and fluctuated with increasing days after planting fig 4 the full irrigation treatment ck had higher sws values than the other treatments during the summer maize growing season sws for ck varied from 192 mm to 311 mm in 2018 from 191 mm to 298 mm in 2019 and from 170 mm to 275 mm in 2020 in contrast the most water deficit treatment t2 values of sws fluctuated in the range of 182 242 mm in 2018 170 245 mm in 2019 and 173 235 mm in 2020 furthermore sws for treatments with lower irrigation amounts in each growth stage were usually lower than for the other irrigation treatments at the end of each growth stage period during v12 r1 in 2018 sws for every treatment increased by about 20 mm because precipitation on 58 days after planting came before the rain shelter could be closed the changes in sws reflected the water consumption of summer maize for all of the treatments sws declined more sharply during v6 v12 v12 r1 and the early stages of r1 r6 the sws of the treatments with greater irrigation amounts changed more especially during the periods of high water consumption of summer maize for the treatments with low irrigation amounts sws changed more slowly especially when sws reached a critical value in the later part of each growth stage period furthermore it can be seen that the lowest value of sws during each growth stage period for lower irrigation amount treatments gradually decreased as the growing season progressed 3 2 spatio temporal dynamics of soil water during summer maize growing seasons 3 2 1 soil water content dynamic change of swc differed with soil depth and maize growth stage fig 5 as maize growth stage progressed swc changed and reached a maximum at middle and later stage showing a gradual increase in water consumption by summer maize swc in the topsoil decreased faster and soil water change rate decreased with increasing soil depth we found that shallow soil tended to dry first and then those dry conditions gradually advanced to deeper soil swc at different soil depths showed significant distribution differences due to different irrigation amounts for the three summer maize growing seasons fig 5 large amounts of irrigation water can cause deep water percolation and can decrease maize water use efficiency especially during the middle and late growth stages under the full irrigation treatment ck deep water percolation below the 100 cm soil depth was observed during growth stages v12 r1 and r1 r6 fig 5a 6b in contrast di caused a concentration of soil water in shallow soil soil water often changed at the 60 cm soil depth for the treatments that included a period with di at 0 6et and the soil remained dry for a long time during the later growth stages e g such as v6 to r6 with t2 v12 to r1 with t4 and t6 r1 to r6 with t3 and t7 etc 3 2 2 soil water consumption rate the soil profile was divided into six layers 0 20 21 40 41 60 61 80 81 100 101 120 cm to analyze the soil water consumption rate wcr of summer maize in each soil layer under different irrigation levels fig 6 seasonal patterns of wcr were observed with increasing maize growth stage and the increase in the size of the root system in all three growing seasons the main water consumption layer of the soil increased over time wcr increased rapidly from v3 to v6 and from v6 to v12 remained at higher values during v12 r1 followed by a gradual decrease during r1 r6 for the full irrigation treatment we observed that from planting to v6 wcr mainly occurred in the 0 40 cm soil layer and the fluctuation range and average value of wcr decreased with increasing soil depth take 2018 as an example in the 0 20 cm and 21 40 cm soil layers the wcr ranges were 0 01 1 56 mm d 1 average 0 54 mm d 1 and 0 06 0 92 mm d 1 average 0 39 mm d 1 respectively during v6 v12 the soil layer that produced soil water consumption gradually extended to the 60 cm depth also average wcr continued to increase to 1 18 1 01 and 0 49 mm d 1 for the three respective soil depths during v12 r1 the soil layer that produced wcr gradually extended to the 80 cm soil depth with an average wcr of 0 22 mm d 1 wcr values increased to their highest values in other soil layers 0 60 cm during r1 r6 average wcr values gradually decreased to 0 67 0 46 0 28 and 0 20 mm d 1 in the four respective soil layers the different irrigation amounts affected the soil water distribution in different soil layers and thus also affected wcr wcr in different soil layers could be decreased under di the greater values decreased with increasing deficit degree for example during stages v3 to v6 under the lower irrigation treatments mean wcr in the 0 40 cm soil layer decreased by 22 8 39 2 for the 0 8 eta treatment and by 33 7 78 6 for the 0 6 eta treatment 3 3 cumulative soil water consumption characteristics cumulative soil water consumption in the 0 20 cm surface soil layer table 3 was the largest of all of the layers 125 0 153 7 mm accounting for 42 8 58 6 of the total soil water consumption for the different irrigation treatments in 2018 the respective values were 115 4 137 3 mm and 39 9 51 2 in 2019 and 92 8 112 1 mm and 42 5 53 5 in 2020 cumulative soil water consumption gradually decreased with increasing soil depth for all of the irrigation treatments in the amounts of 30 2 37 6 3 8 19 0 0 1 7 7 and 0 4 1 3 for the 21 40 cm 41 60 cm 61 80 cm and 81 100 cm soil layers respectively in 2018 32 4 37 9 10 1 22 7 0 5 5 8 and 0 2 1 4 in 2019 and 34 4 40 6 7 1 19 4 0 5 5 8 and 0 3 0 1 in 2020 more than 92 1 of the water consumption was concentrated in the 0 60 cm soil layer and very little water was consumed by summer maize below the 80 cm soil depth varied irrigation amounts affected the soil water consumption amount in different soil layers table 3 the cumulative soil water consumption values in the 0 20 21 40 and 41 60 cm soil layers with ck treatment were significantly p 0 05 higher than t2 treatments and slightly higher than the others treatments there were no significant differences p 0 05 in soil water consumption among the others treatments soil water consumption amount in the 61 80 cm soil depth in 2018 and 2019 with t8 treatment was higher than t7 treatment and significantly p 0 05 higher than the others treatments indicating that continuous water stress during v3 v6 and v6 v12 growth stages promoted the absorption of deep soil water by maize after full irrigation during later growth stages as for the soil water consumption amount below the 80 cm soil depth there were no significant differences p 0 05 3 4 daily evapotranspiration eta and soil evaporation e summer maize eta was successfully calculated using swc values recorded by the tdr 310s sensors as seen in the comparison with eta obtained from the large weighing lysimeters over the three growing seasons fig 7 the regression slopes between the two methods were 0 96 r2 0 95 in 2019 and 0 91 r2 0 93 in 2018 fig 7b daily actual evapotranspiration under the different irrigation treatments during the 2018 2020 maize growing seasons is presented in fig 8 seasonal variations in eta were observed during all three years of the study with lower values from planting to v3 that increased rapidly during v3 v6 and v6 v12 and then remained at higher values during v12 r1 eta decreased gradually during r1 r6 during planting v3 soil evaporation accounted for a large proportion of eta due to small lai and variations in eta were mainly associated with meteorological factors and swc i e eta decreased as surface soil moisture gradually declined due to the gradual increase in lai as maize developed transpiration gradually took over as the main proportion of eta eta initially increased and then decreased during each growth stage period v3 v6 v6 v12 v12 r1 mainly due to the accelerated growth and increased lai that occurred after irrigation at the beginning of each growth stage period during the later part of each growth stage period eta declined as plants were subjected to increasing water stress as soil water gradually declined di significantly reduced eta during the water deficit stages fig 8 when irrigation was reduced 20 and 40 mean daily eta was reduced by 0 45 mm d 1 15 2 and 0 99 mm d 1 33 8 respectively in 2018 and reduced by 0 40 mm d 1 15 9 and 0 65 mm d 1 25 7 respectively in 2019 during v3 v6 eta was reduced by 0 55 0 88 mm d 1 11 6 17 4 and 1 68 2 00 mm d 1 in 2018 and reduced by 0 35 0 72 mm d 1 9 6 17 2 and 0 95 1 55 mm d 1 26 1 36 8 in 2019 during v6 v12 for the same two respective reductions in irrigation amounts v12 r1 is a critical growth stage period for water demand water deficits during this stage accelerate the aging process of leaves significantly reducing the evapotranspiration rate during this period mean daily eta was reduced by 0 54 mm d 1 9 8 and 2 29 mm d 1 41 6 in 2018 and by 1 29 mm d 1 18 0 and 3 46 mm d 1 48 5 in 2019 during this period when water deficit was 20 and 40 respectively during r1 r6 eta decreased over time due to decreasing air temperature and solar radiation fig 2 and the gradual aging of plants resulting in smaller eta differences between the water deficit treatments during the entire summer maize growing season daily e values for the full irrigation treatment ranged from 0 10 to 2 06 mm d 1 average 0 76 mm d 1 during planting v3 from 0 82 to 3 37 mm d 1 average 1 86 mm d 1 during v3 v6 from 1 10 to 2 58 mm d 1 average 1 74 mm d 1 during v6 v12 from 0 21 to 2 20 mm d 1 average 1 22 mm d 1 during v12 r1 and from 0 12 to 1 21 mm d 1 average 0 54 mm d 1 during r1 r6 in 2018 daily soil water evaporation gradually decreased from v3 to v6 to r1 r6 and similar characteristics were observed in the other two years of the experiment fig 8 also the effects of di on e were less than on eta di reduced e to a certain extent in each growth stage period when irrigation was reduced 20 and 40 in 2018 mean daily e was reduced by 0 23 mm d 1 12 2 and 0 47 mm d 1 25 7 respectively during v3 v6 0 12 mm d 1 5 8 and 0 32 mm d 1 16 4 during v6 v12 0 05 mm d 1 4 0 and 0 13 mm d 1 9 7 during v12 r1 and 0 07 mm d 1 13 6 and 0 22 mm d 1 41 7 during r1 r6 the same pattern was observed in 2019 and 2020 after irrigation applications soil evaporation for treatments subjected to water stress in the earlier growth stage periods was usually greater than soil evaporation observed in the full irrigation treatment 3 5 soil evaporation e and transpiration t during different maize growth stage periods values of e and t for each growth stage and total eta consistently increased as the total amount of irrigation increased table 4 during v3 v6 irrigation had a great influence on e the soil evaporation values with 100 eta irrigation treatments were significantly p 0 05 higher than 80 and 60 eta irrigation treatments the transpiration t values with 60 eta irrigation treatments were significantly lower than the others treatments there were no significant differences p 0 05 in t between 100 and 80 eta irrigation treatments during the middle and later growth stages irrigation had a significantly p 0 05 influence on t but only limited effects on e for instance the ranges for t were 47 0 95 9 mm and 26 6 55 6 mm for the different irrigation treatments during v12 r1 and r1 r6 respectively in contrast e ranged from only 23 9 mm to 31 1 mm and from 8 5 mm to 15 5 mm respectively during these two stages the effects on e and t of restoring an adequate water supply after maize had suffered different degrees of water stress in the previous growth stage period were different we found that soil water evaporation tended to increase while crop transpiration decreased after maize was irrigated with full water following a period of severe water stress before consider for example ck t3 and t6 irrigated with 100 80 and 60 et respectively during v3 v6 all three treatments subsequently received the same irrigation amount 100 et during v6 v12 and e was 1 8 mm and 2 8 mm greater for t3 and t6 respectively than for ck while t was 2 7 mm and 5 0 mm respectively less than for ck in 2018 similar results for the change characteristics of e and t were observed for other maize growth stages t accounted for 55 9 67 5 57 4 69 0 and 54 5 67 4 of the total water consumption in 2018 2019 and 2020 respectively and was the main consumption component for the entire summer maize growing season t and t eta increased gradually as the growing season progressed fig 9 with values of t eta of 8 1 33 4 40 6 48 1 67 9 66 3 78 2 and 75 8 82 0 during planting v3 v3 v6 v6 v12 v12 r1 r1 r6 respectively in 2018 7 0 32 1 35 7 60 3 72 9 67 5 80 7 and 75 2 79 4 in 2019 and 13 6 35 7 43 9 47 7 68 2 57 9 76 3 and 77 1 82 2 in 2020 the changes in e eta over time were opposite to the changes in t eta over time 3 6 yield and water use efficiency across all treatments maize yields ranged from 5168 5 to 8302 9 kg ha 1 4876 7 to 7874 5 kg ha 1 and 4638 0 to 6723 6 kg ha 1 in 2018 2019 and 2020 respectively table 5 the ck treatment clearly had the highest yield while t2 had the lowest yield varying degrees of water deficit affected maize yields to different extents maize yields for t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 and t8 were significantly p 0 05 lower by 37 8 5 6 7 9 11 6 20 7 18 2 and 19 9 respectively than for the ck treatment in 2018 and lower by 40 2 18 7 17 7 15 8 26 3 23 8 and 26 6 in 2019 treatments t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 and t8 were significantly p 0 05 lower by 29 8 31 0 20 4 29 7 20 1 and 32 3 respectively in 2020 maize yields for t1 decreased by 3 3 8 0 p 0 05 in the three growing seasons and yields under t3 were also close to ck yields in 2018 and 2020 severe water deficit during v3 v6 also affected crop yield to a certain extent t6 t7 t8 t3 t4 t5 ck t1 wue values ranged from 2 48 to 2 96 kg m 3 in 2018 2 18 to 2 58 kg m 3 in 2019 and 2 47 to 2 85 kg m 3 in 2020 table 5 higher wue values were observed in 2018 than in the other years primarily because some rainwater fell on the plots during v12 r1 in addition to the influence of meteorological factors resulting in greater yield and wue for the treatments suffering from water stress during this stage the t2 treatment had the lowest wue due to continuous di of 40 eta during the last three growth stage periods that resulted in extremely low yield in all three years the ck treatment did not have the largest wue despite having the greatest yield because of ineffective water consumption the highest wue in 2018 and 2019 was observed for t4 that had full irrigation during r1 r6 showing that adequate irrigation during the grain filling stage could effectively improve wue wue for t1 was 5 5 7 5 greater than for ck although yield for t1 was 3 3 8 0 lower than for ck this result demonstrates the potential of improving maize wue by using a moderate di application strategy at different developmental stages 4 discussion 4 1 temporal and spatial characteristics of soil water for summer maize 4 1 1 soil water distribution characteristics precipitation was excluded with a rain shelter in this experiment making irrigation the main source of water for consumption by et distribution characteristics of swc in the soil profile and sws depend on the water balance between the irrigation amount and water consumption the profile water distributions differed in our study because of the different irrigation water application amounts fig 5 determining reasonable irrigation amounts is important for establishing proper water distribution in soil for uptake by the maize root system yang et al 2018 under the full irrigation treatment a large amount of the irrigation water applied could not be utilized effectively by maize because of direct infiltration into the deep soil layer beyond the maize root system as observed in our previous study xu et al 2020 in contrast applications of less irrigation water can cause uneven distribution of water and lead to long periods of dry soil conditions fig 5 that adversely affect normal growth of crops effectively reducing deep percolation and increasing the efficient use of soil water is vital for improving the utilization efficiency of irrigation water in irrigated farmland chen et al 2020 xu et al 2020 according to our results the appropriate amount of irrigation water required for summer maize production should be controlled in the top 80 cm of the soil profile this conclusion is similar to the result reported by wu et al 2016 under furrow irrigation using isotope methods 4 1 2 soil water consumption rate characteristics soil water redistribution occurred within 1 3 days following irrigation and the reduction in soil water was partly due to et and partly due to the movement of soil water during the water redistribution process therefore soil water consumption in the upper layers was overestimated by evapotranspiration during the several days after irrigation soil water consumption was the result of two forcing actions water consumption in the surface soil layers was dependent on water absorption by roots and soil water evaporation while water consumption in deeper soil layers occurred in response to only water absorption by roots obvious seasonal patterns of wcr were mostly related to root growth and distribution characteristics at different maize growth stages wu et al 2016 during the early growth stage period we found that wcr occurred from as deep as 40 cm deeper than the 20 cm thickness of the general evaporation layer fig 6 mainly because a soil water potential gradient established between the upper dry surface and deeper wet layers promoted capillary rise of water in response to evaporative demand jha et al 2017 li et al 2010 as maize growth stage progressed and the root system gradually developed wcr gradually increased and extended to deeper soil we observed that wcr in the top soil layers fluctuated affected by solar radiation and gradually decreased over time in every irrigation cycle because wcr was very sensitive to swc wang et al 2020a with wcr gradually declining with decreasing swc it is worth noting that during every irrigation cycle before r1 wcr in the top layer decreased and wcr in the deeper layers gradually increased these changes were mainly because swc in the top soil layer declined faster than in the deeper soil layers fig 6 and the declining soil water availability likely stimulated root extension into deeper soil wu et al 2016 thus increasing the utilization of deeper 21 60 cm soil water above ground plant organs began senescing during r1 r6 and wcr in different soil layers gradually declined during this time the wcr fluctuation pattern in deeper soil layers was very consistent with what was observed in the top soil layer fig 6 irrigation had a significant effect on wcr in our study because maize root absorption characteristics were greatly influenced by swc wu et al 2016 because wcr is sensitive to swc wcr in different soil layers was found to be comparatively high for the full irrigation treatment which had higher available soil water compared with other di treatments wcr declined under moderate water deficit conditions but wcr in both upper and deeper layers was rapidly restored to the full irrigation treatment level and even exceeded that level after rewatering irrigation was applied fig 6 especially in the early growth stage period this was mainly because the inactive roots caused by dry soil conditions in the upper soil layers quickly recovered activity after the next irrigation was applied green and clothier 1995 wang et al 2020a moderate soil water deficit could also stimulate the root system to extend into deeper soil layers peng et al 2022 wu et al 2016 and thereby increase soil water absorption by deeper roots therefore using the compensating effects of root growth and differing distribution patterns of water absorption could effectively increase the utilization of deep soil water and nutrients in order to achieve the goal of saving irrigation water in actual agricultural production 4 1 3 soil water consumption characteristics from different soil layers the maize root system is fibrous and it is the key bridge between the plant and the soil root system distribution characteristics are an important indicator of maize root water uptake zhang et al 2022a as maize grows and develops the main depth of water absorption and the proportion of deep water consumed gradually increased as a previous analysis of wcr has shown where deep roots developed and played an important role in contributing to water absorption in the deep layers of the soil profile li et al 2011 showed that maize roots were mainly distributed in the 20 60 cm soil layer during the middle growth stage periods and the soil layer with the maximum root density was 40 80 cm during the late growth stage period additionally summer maize increased the utilization of middle layer 21 60 cm soil water during the middle and late growing season thus according to the results of our study the appropriate wetting depth for maize production is suggested to be 40 cm before v6 60 cm during v6 v12 and 80 cm during v12 r6 these results are similar to findings with furrow irrigation for maize previously reported by wu et al 2016 with regard to total soil water consumption from different soil depths throughout the entire maize growing season the results showed that maize absorbed a large proportion of water from the surface soil layer after irrigation events about 39 9 58 6 of maize water depletion was from the 0 20 cm soil layer as also reported by wang et al 2010 wang et al 2020a the main uptake zone was the top 20 cm of the soil profile because of higher root length density in this layer as described by qi et al 2018 additionally soil water consumption in the upper soil layer mainly depends on both water absorption by roots and evaporative demand and most of the evaporation water consumption occurred in the 0 20 cm soil layer water absorption in the lower regions from 21 to 40 cm and from 41 to 60 cm ranged from 30 2 to 40 6 and from 3 8 to 22 7 respectively of the total water consumption based on the three study years only 0 0 7 7 of the total water consumption was from the 61 80 cm soil layer and water absorption below 80 cm was almost negligible soil water consumption in the 0 60 cm soil layer accounted for more than 92 of the total water consumption wang et al 2010 also found that maize mainly utilized soil water from the 0 50 cm layer during the entire growing season using an isotope method previous studies have shown that the 0 60 cm soil layer was the primary zone of maize root growth and distribution liao et al 2014 peng et al 2012 there were no obvious differences for soil water consumption in the surface soil layer due to di treatments but more and more differences gradually developed with increasing soil depth soil water consumption in a deeper 61 80 cm soil layer increased after full irrigation during later growth stages when maize suffered from different degrees of water stress during multiple continuous growth stages this situation was observed for the t7 and t8 treatments indicating that roots continuously extended into deeper depths so that plants could survive when subjected to continuing water stress even so soil water consumption in different soil layers gradually decreased overall as irrigation amount decreased crop demand and soil water supply lead to dynamic changes in the main water absorption layers zhang et al 2022a in our study irrigation was the only source of water for maize and the distribution of water in the soil determined the amount of water absorption the higher availability of water in the upper soil profile compared with deeper layers resulted in higher water absorption and water consumption proportion for the di treatments table 3 4 2 evapotranspiration characteristics 4 2 1 soil water evaporation and evapotranspiration soil water evaporation is usually considered to be ineffective water loss and reducing soil water evaporation can actually decrease water loss from farmland and improve crop wue daily soil water evaporation fluctuated in our study and gradually decreased during v3 r6 fig 8 the proportion of evaporation the evaporation fraction was greatest during the initial growth stage period and then decreased during crop development this result was consistent with results reported by ding et al 2013 wang et al 2020b yu et al 2016 for maize and for other crops liu et al 2022 zhao et al 2015 soil water and lai are the most important factors influencing soil water evaporation jiang et al 2016 liu et al 2002 soil water evaporation is the main component of eta during the initial crop growth stage period because swc is sufficient to respond to the actual evaporative demand during this period as lai increases water loss through maize stomata increases wen et al 2016 and t increases to become the main source of eta transpiration in our study increased with increasing lai during v3 r1 and declined with leaf senescence during r1 r6 irrigation had a stronger effect on maize t than on e in our study and similar results were reported by wang et al 2020c for winter wheat under di decreasing irrigation amounts resulted in lower swc especially in deep soil and caused leaf stomatal conductance to decrease once subjected to water stress resulting in decreased transpiration however in our study soil water evaporation generally occurred in the top soil layer and was affected by swc and lai di decreased both lai and swc and caused a small fluctuation in e water stress at v3 v6 had little effect on summer maize and eta and t returned to the non water stressed level after the next irrigation even leading to a compensation effect fig 6 table 4 due to the di enhancement of water absorption from deep layers fig 6 the evapotranspiration compensation effect has also been reported for pear jujube trees zizyphus jujube mill feng et al 2017 wheat wang et al 2020a and other plants liu et al 2022 peng et al 2022 however it was difficult for t to return to the non water stressed level when maize suffered different degrees of water stress that occurred after v6 table 4 this was primarily because after v6 maize grew rapidly and needed large amounts of water the subsequent water shortage inhibited plant growth root development and co2 assimilation wang et al 2020c 4 2 2 t eta and e eta for summer maize during each of the three growing seasons of the experiment the e fraction of evapotranspiration e eta over the entire growing season ranged from 31 to 32 5 for the full irrigation treatment these values were greater than the value reported by kang et al 2003 of 26 calculated by the soil water balance method using micro lysimeters and less than the value reported by yu et al 2016 of 36 4 calculated by the direct method in yangling in the guanzhong plain our results were close to observations reported by liu et al 2002 of 30 3 and hu and lei 2021 of 28 for the multi year mean growing season in the north china plain and by ding et al 2013 of 31 for shiyanghe in gansu province of northwest china during the maize growing season e eta changed regularly with the development of lai fig 10 e eta decreased markedly with increasing lai previous studies showed that the relationship between e eta and lai followed the form of an exponential equation brisson et al 1992 liu et al 2002 to explore the effect of di on e eta we analyzed summer maize e eta and lai under 100 80 and 60 et irrigation amounts beginning at v6 for the ck t1 and t2 treatments during 2018 2020 we found that soil water affected e eta demonstrating that sufficient soil water supply decreased e eta especially during the middle and later growth stage periods fig 10 i e e eta decreased with increasing irrigation amounts the same relationship was also be found by jha et al 2017 yu et al 2009 mainly because the adequate water supply significantly increased maize transpiration and significantly increased lai compared with the di treatments fig 10 our results indicated that despite the lower total soil evaporation under di e eta increased to a certain extent therefore from this perspective di was not effective in reducing e et 4 3 evapotranspiration in relation to soil water determining the water threshold that affects eta of crops at different growth stages is vital for irrigation management to eliminate the effect of meteorological factors on eta eta et0 was used to determine the response of eta to soil water eta et0 was found to be related to swc during all maize growth stages and the relationships between eta et0 and swc were quite different at different growth stages fig 11 over the entire maize growing season eta et0 initially increased and then gradually decreased and was closely related to lai changes over time guo et al 2020 han et al 2022 during planting v3 eta et0 showed a linear increasing trend with swc r2 0 21 0 25 fig 11 a1 a3 because eta et0 was dominated by soil evaporation due to the lower lai during this early growth stage period and similar to the effect of soil water on soil evaporation zhang et al 2022b eta et0 was mainly affected by swc at this stage during v3 v6 the relationships between eta et0 and swc followed the form of a quadratic curve r2 0 49 0 52 demonstrating that eta et0 was basically stable as swc became higher than 22 0 72 of field capacity fc eta et0 continuously declined as swc decreased below 22 0 indicating that summer maize would be subject to some degree of water stress when swc was below 22 0 72 of fc at this stage we noted that eta et0 at v6 v12 initially increased and then decreased as swc decreased also following the form of a quadratic curve r2 0 27 0 64 as kang et al 2003 and wang et al 2020d reported eta et0 increased under an adequate soil water supply as lai increased rapidly during this period in our study for the 100 and 80 eta treatments when soil water was below about 22 0 72 of fc eta et0 decreased with decreasing soil water showing the threshold value that affected maize evapotranspiration during v6 v12 to be 22 0 72 of fc similar to what was observed for v3 v6 during v12 r1 and r1 r6 the relationships between eta et0 and swc followed a decreasing logistic relationship for all irrigation treatments and the relationships were slightly different for the two growth stage periods r2 0 57 0 71 and 0 22 0 67 respectively during v12 r1 eta et0 remained at a relatively stable high value as lai reached higher values guo et al 2020 wang et al 2020d until swc decreased to about 18 0 60 of fc at swc less than 18 0 eta et0 decreased rapidly with decreasing soil water indicating that the water deficit threshold during v12 r1 was 60 of fc during r1 r6 eta et0 decreased as swc declined and the decreasing rate was initially slow and then accelerated during this period of decreasing lai eta et0 gradually decreased as the period was prolonged kang et al 2003 it was worth noting that the fitting relationships for treatments t3 t8 during the middle and later growth stage periods had higher r2 values indicating eta et0 for di treatments was more related to soil water consumption 4 4 water consumption and productivity characteristics for summer maize in practice researching soil water absorption depth and amounts eta partitioning characteristics and water productivity under different irrigation treatments can help us understand the proper absorption depth for roots and water use processes and thereby produce more efficient irrigation strategies in irrigated maize cropland yang et al 2018 fig 12 presents a schematic representation of e t total eta and soil water consumption amount w at different soil depths during different summer maize growth stages under the 100 80 and 60 eta irrigation treatments total eta for full irrigation was 324 9 327 9 mm during the growing season during planting v3 14 8 15 8 mm water was consumed as eta of which 13 6 14 7 mm was e soil water consumption amount was 8 6 9 4 mm from the 0 20 cm soil layer and 6 2 6 4 mm from 21 to 40 cm during v3 v6 total eta was 43 7 47 0 mm and 27 3 29 2 16 1 17 4 and 0 3 0 4 mm of soil water came from the 0 20 21 40 and 41 60 mm layers respectively of which 59 4 63 3 came from e during v6 v12 eta was 70 3 79 1 mm and e was 21 4 22 6 mm with 31 4 33 4 27 5 28 5 and 12 4 17 2 mm coming from the 0 20 21 40 and 41 60 mm soil layers respectively during v12 r1 eta was 108 2 122 7 mm and e was 20 9 26 8 mm with 41 9 51 5 36 8 39 9 24 6 26 6 and 4 6 7 4 mm coming from the 0 20 cm 21 40 cm 41 60 and 61 80 cm soil layers respectively during r1 r6 eta declined to 70 8 81 1 mm and e was 14 5 16 7 mm with 23 6 29 8 22 5 22 9 13 4 23 9 4 6 6 4 and 0 9 4 3 mm being absorbed from the respective soil layers when irrigation was reduced by 20 and 40 during v3 v6 eta was reduced to 36 4 39 9 mm and 31 1 32 1 mm respectively water absorption was reduced in the 0 40 cm soil layer but water absorption was increased in the 41 60 cm soil layer during the other maize growth stages irrigation amount decreased water consumption amount in every soil layer gradually decreased soil e loss decreased to varying degrees and e eta increased fig 12 deficit irrigation treatments decreased root water absorption and t eta ratio but also increased water productivity to a certain extent wue was higher for t1 t3 t4 and t5 in 2018 and for t1 and t4 in 2019 compared with ck showing that moderate di in the early growth stage period and adequate or moderate water supply in the middle and later stages could improve wue as similarly reported by attia et al 2021 moderate di could cause partial stomatal closure resulting in reduced transpiration from leaves thereby reducing plant water use with minimal reduction in photosynthesis chai et al 2016 we also found lower wue for t2 due to severe stress compared with the full irrigation amount between v6 and r6 the t8 treatment was subjected to severe water stress during v3 v12 and the result was in accordance with the findings of zou et al 2021 and song et al 2016 severe water deficit during vegetative growth with t8 inhibited vegetative organ development and affected kernel number and kernel weight during reproductive growth li et al 2018 resulting in severe yield reduction during v6 r6 maize suffered successive periods of water stress with t2 that seriously affected crop yield and severely reduced wue overall severe di treatments led to considerable yield losses and lower wues in our study t1 was more effective in using water than ck with wue increased by 5 5 7 4 irrigation amount decreased by 12 3 14 5 and yield decreased by 3 3 8 1 rodrigues et al 2013 also pointed out that moderate di could lead to better water productivity and is generally economically feasible these results indicated the potential for saving water in the region by following a combination of moderate di application at different developmental stages employing moderate di during earlier growth stages followed by full or moderate irrigation during reproductive growth stages could maximize wue 5 conclusions deficit irrigation could be an effective way to increase the utilization efficiency of agricultural water resources however assessing soil water consumption characteristics at different soil depths and separation of evaporation and transpiration under di have not been systematically investigated in this study an irrigation experiment with several different di treatments over three consecutive years was conducted to study the effects of di on the spatio temporal dynamics of soil water and evapotranspiration partitioning in summer maize and to determine water productivity in semi arid northwest china the results of this research demonstrated that about 39 9 58 6 of maize water consumption was from the 0 20 cm soil layer and soil water consumption above a soil depth of 60 cm accounted for more than 92 of the total water consumption the appropriate wetting depth for maize production in this region is suggested to be 40 cm before v6 60 cm during v6 v12 and 80 cm during v12 r6 irrigation amount greatly influenced maize water consumption compared with full irrigation di affected soil water distribution and availability and thus reduced wcr and root water absorption amount moderate water deficit during v3 v6 could stimulate root extension into deeper soil layers and increase water absorption from deeper layers swc could be rapidly restored to the full irrigation level and could even exceed the non water stressed level after a subsequent irrigation reflecting a compensatory effect of root water absorption di had a stronger effect on maize t than on soil e even though di decreased total soil evaporation amount it increased e eta and wue the threshold soil water value for defining when summer maize was subjected to water stress was 22 0 72 of fc during v3 v12 and 18 0 60 of fc during v12 r1 this study was limited by the potential bias regarding soil evaporation that may have occurred by using measurements from micro lysimeters placed between two crop rows also deep percolation was not taken into account during the estimation of actual eta further research should consider the use of a correction factor to more accurately estimate soil evaporation and to consider deep percolation when estimating actual eta in the field despite the study s limitations these findings help us to better understand maize water utilization characteristics and water productivity under di and help to make effective water management decision for agricultural production in arid areas of northwest china furthermore it should be noted that water utilization characteristics and productivity under di may become more complicated under future climate change conditions a better understanding of water utilization and productivity response to climate change will require further investigations in the

2300,continuously increasing the utilization efficiency of agricultural water resources is vital to ensuring future water and food security deficit irrigation di could provide a solution to optimize crop water productivity research on the spatio temporal dynamics of soil water coupled with evapotranspiration partitioning is important for clarifying summer maize zea mays l water utilization characteristics and crop water productivity under different di strategies especially in semi arid regions consequently a three year field experiment with full irrigation ck and eight di treatments t1 t8 comprised of combinations of 100 80 and 60 of crop evapotranspiration was conducted data from large scale weighing lysimeters micro lysimeters and tdr sensors were combined to assess daily root water absorption at different soil depths actual evapotranspiration eta partitioning into plant transpiration t and soil water evaporation e and water use efficiency wue results showed that soil water consumption mainly occurred in the 0 40 cm 0 60 cm and 0 80 cm soil layers during the maize growth stages of planting v6 v6 v12 and v12 r6 respectively water absorption above the 60 cm soil depth accounted for more than 92 of the total water consumption the appropriate irrigation wetting depth for summer maize could be controlled in the top 80 cm layer to avoid deep percolation di affected soil water distribution and availability and thus decreased soil water consumption rate wcr and root water absorption amount under moderate water deficit conditions wcr was rapidly restored to the non water stressed irrigation treatment level and even exceeded that level in the deeper layers after a subsequent irrigation was applied especially in the early maize growth stages e eta was 31 0 32 5 under full irrigation di decreased total soil water evaporation amount but increased the e eta ratio the threshold soil water value for defining when maize was subjected to water stress was 22 0 72 of fc during v3 v12 and 18 0 60 of fc during v12 r1 our results suggest that less water was used in t1 moderate di than with the full irrigation treatment wue increased by 5 5 7 5 as irrigation amount decreased by 12 3 14 5 and yield decreased by 3 3 8 0 these results improve our understanding of maize water consumption characteristics with regard to soil water absorption in different soil layers and evapotranspiration partitioning and provide implications for efficient water management in arid areas of northwest china keywords deficit irrigation soil water consumption evapotranspiration

increasing the utilization efficiency of agricultural water resources is the fundamental means of ensuring future water and food security and has become a global concern kang 2014 more than half of the global agricultural area is facing drought challenges and drought has been a major limiting factor affecting agricultural production in the world liu et al 2022 in china agriculture is the main user of water total water resources are 3160 5 billion m3 and total water consumption is 581 3 billion m3 of which agricultural water accounts for 62 1 of china s total water consumption ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 2021 in the arid and semi arid regions of china insufficient water resources challenge the sustainability of conventional agricultural practices kang et al 2017 an effective way to increase the utilization efficiency of agricultural water resources is the use of deficit irrigation di i e the amount of irrigation water applied is less than the crop water demand at some growth stages costa et al 2007 di could save water and increase water use efficiency of crops while minimizing adverse effects on yield du et al 2010 kang et al 2002 yu et al 2020 zou et al 2021 previous studies of di have mainly focused on crop physiological characteristics evapotranspiration yield and water use efficiency wue costa et al 2007 feng et al 2017 liu et al 2022 mu et al 2021 zou et al 2021 however assessing soil water consumption characteristics at different soil depths and partitioning evapotranspiration into evaporation and transpiration under di have not been systematically investigated further exploring how soil water is consumed and how evapotranspiration partitioning is affected by irrigation application timing and amount is very important for generating deep understanding of maize zea mays l water consumption under di soil water content swc is affected by atmospheric conditions through direct soil water evaporation and vegetation transpiration vereecken et al 2014 plants extract water from soil and root water uptake is responsive to soil water availability wang et al 2020a soil water distribution in the soil profile is determined to a large extent by water uptake when root zone swc decreases below a certain threshold e g 50 of total available water root water uptake can be significantly reduced and plant growth will be restricted liu et al 2022 a previous study has shown that under di swc and its distribution were both affected wang et al 2020a leading to differences in water absorption as maize grows and the root system continues to develop and expand the depth of soil water extraction and the rate of crop water absorption increases yang et al 2018 crop growth stage plays a vital role in decision making related to the use of di zou et al 2021 in spite of this the effects of different levels of reduced irrigation application amounts under di at different growth stages on maize water absorption at different soil depths and the recovery characteristics of maize water absorption in the growth period following the restoration of full irrigation have not been thoroughly investigated previously therefore accurate estimation of soil water absorption characteristics in the maize root zone under different di management strategies is important for determining optimal irrigation wetting depth and proper irrigation management for irrigated agriculture in arid regions crop evapotranspiration et is generally divided into soil water evaporation e and plant transpiration t and is a crucial component in hydrological and ecological processes knowledge of et plays a key role in agricultural irrigation management feng et al 2017 kang et al 2000 in agricultural ecosystems the fractions of e and t in et have been used as indicators of water use efficiency wang et al 2021 in field studies micro lysimeters have been widely used to measure e because they are simple and provide cost effective and reliable measurements kang et al 2003 et can be measured by the combination of sap flow systems and micro lysimeters large weighing lysimeters eddy covariance systems bowen ratio energy balance systems and the soil water balance method wang et al 2021 for example liu et al 2002 used large scale weighing lysimeters and micro lysimeters to monitor daily e and et of winter wheat triticum aestivum l and maize ma et al 2020 used sap flow systems and micro lysimeters to directly measure maize and wheat t and e wang et al 2020d used eddy covariance systems to study et partitioning and crop coefficients for maize in a dry semi humid climate regime the isotope method based on different isotopic compositions of t and e was also used to partition et good et al 2014 soil water content measurements acquired with tdr sensors and soil evaporation measurements made with micro lysimeters are frequently used in the water balance method to monitor and quantify et and e tdr sensers are a promising tool for monitoring soil water content and estimating soil water absorption characteristics in the maize root zone et calculated by the water balance method using tdr sensers coupled soil evaporation measurements made with micro lysimeters have been successfully used to quantify and compare the differences between et and e under various irrigation situations swc and leaf area index lai have been found to be important factors influencing e jiang et al 2016 liu et al 2002 and et has been found to be highly dependent on swc under insufficient irrigation water supply swc and lai are restricted to some extent leading to questions related to how e and e et change under di and what the swc threshold is that results in significantly reduced et assessing the water consumption of each component of et under di could be facilitated by evapotranspiration partitioning the guanzhong plain in the shaanxi province of northwest china is a vital grain production area summer maize and winter wheat are the main crops grown in this area xu et al 2020 therefore a three year di experiment with a range of irrigation amounts applied at different maize growth stages was conducted to determine the spatio temporal dynamics of soil water coupled with evapotranspiration partitioning to clarify maize water consumption characteristics and water productivity under di the objectives of this study were to determine i the spatio temporal dynamics of soil water to assess water consumption in different soil layers during the maize growing season under di ii the soil evaporation and maize transpiration characteristics and et partitioning under di and iii the water consumption characteristics and water productivity of summer maize under di 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description

respective three growing seasons mean temperature solar radiation sunshine duration and et0 were all lowest in 2020 the mean daily temperature solar radiation and et0 during the three experimental years are shown in fig 2 2 2 experimental design the maize variety wuke 2 was grown in this study because it is commonly grown in the region xu et al 2020 zou et al 2021 summer maize was planted at 60 000 plants ha 1 in rows spaced 50 cm apart on 20 june 2018 12 june 2019 and 16 june 2020 with 240 kg n ha 1 and 120 kg p2o5 ha 1 applied at planting four successive phenological periods in the summer maize growing season were identified to study the influence of different irrigation amounts those periods were v3 3 leaf v6 6 leaf v6 v12 12 leaf v12 r1 silking and r1 r6 physiological maturity with the growth stages defined as in ritchie et al 1986 in order to guarantee the water demand of summer maize in the planting v3 period a 50 mm irrigation was applied before planting a partial orthogonal l9 design scheme taguchi method four growth stage factors and three irrigation levels based on the orthogonality selected from a comprehensive test of some representative test points was used for the nine irrigation treatments eight di treatments with three replications of each treatment during 2018 2020 details of the design scheme and irrigation amounts are provided in table 1 and table 2 nine irrigation treatments incorporating three irrigation amounts control or full irrigation ck 100 of maize eta and two levels as a fraction of the control being 80 and 60 of the irrigation amount applied to ck were applied at different growth stages during the growing season the irrigation method was flood irrigation the experiment was conducted in 25 test plots and two large lysimeter plots fig 3 each test plot had dimensions of 3 m 2 2 m 3 m length width and depth respectively and was made of concrete to limit lateral movement of water between adjacent plots the soil in the plot area was homogeneous with the bulk density of 1 35 g cm 3 being silty clay loam as measured by a laser granularity analyzer mastersizer 3000 malvern uk field capacity in the plot was 31 0 as measured by the cutting ring method cutting rings 100 cm3 were used to collect soil samples from the soil surface to the 120 cm depth the soil samples were then saturated excess gravity water was removed and the resulting measured soil water content was considered to be the field capacity two large lysimeters each with a weighing system precision of 139 g i e 0 021 mm of water were used to accurately monitor summer maize evapotranspiration for the ck and t1 treatments a mobile rain shelter was installed over the experimental plots to exclude precipitation details regarding the large lysimeters can be found in yu et al 2016 diagrams of the location of the test plots the large lysimeters and the rain shelter at the experimental site and the structure of the large lysimeters and the test plot structures are shown in fig 3 2 3 sampling and measurements 2 3 1 volumetric soil water content time domain reflectometer tdr sensors tdr 310s acclima inc meridian idaho usa were installed in every test pit total of 25 test pits to accurately measure volumetric soil water content swc throughout the summer maize growing season during 2018 2020 to ensure the accuracy of soil water measurements every tdr 310s sensor was tested and calibrated before installation in order to reduce the influence of soil disturbance on measurement results a vertical section was excavated in every test pit and a sensor was inserted directly into the undisturbed side at each specified depth 10 20 30 40 50 60 80 100 120 160 200 and 240 cm data from 160 200 and 240 cm were not used as the swc changes at 160 cm were minimal fig 3 swc data were logged at 30 minute intervals using a cr6 data logger campbell scientific inc logan utah usa soil water storage sws was calculated as 1 sws i 1 i 9 sw c i h i where sws is the soil water storage mm swc i is the volumetric soil water content at depth i and hi is the depth interval of each soil water measurement mm soil water consumption rate wcr refers to daily rate of soil water consumption reduction at different soil depths it was calculated by the difference in soil moisture over different soil depths 2 3 2 daily evapotranspiration of maize daily evapotranspiration eta for summer maize was calculated using the difference of swc on two successive days in different soil layers as 2 e t a j 1 n h j sw c ji s w c j i 1 where eta mm is the actual et n is the number of soil layers h j is the soil depth mm for the jth soil layer swc ji swc j i 1 are the volumetric soil water contents for the ith and ith 1 days respectively however there is inevitably some bias in using this equation to calculate eta within 1 3 days after an irrigation when downward movement of water beyond 120 cm deep percolation was not be detected by deep sensors especially in the later summer maize growth stages 2 3 3 soil evaporation and plant transpiration twenty seven micro lysimeters were fabricated from polyvinyl chloride tubes with diameter of 11 cm and height of 20 cm the micro lysimeters were placed centered between two crop rows and pushed into the soil to measure daily evaporation e boast and robertson 1982 evaporation measured in this manner can overestimate the evaporation rate of a plot marek et al 2019 as the lysimeter is placed where the density of leaves is lower especially in the early summer maize growth stages when maize canopy cover is low placing the micro lysimeters between two crop rows to measure soil evaporation in farmland has previously been used by many researchers liu et al 2002 ma et al 2020 yu et al 2016 and produced soil water evaporation results within the allowable bias the micro lysimeters were sealed at the bottom placed back into the soil and weighed after a period of 24 h at 18 00 in the evening every day to ensure that the soil moisture content in each micro lysimeter was similar to the actual soil conditions the soil in the micro lysimeters was changed every 4 5 days and changed immediately after each irrigation changes in the weights of the micro lysimeters were assumed to be equivalent to the amount of water evaporated from the soil surface boast and robertson 1982 the sources of error inherent in the micro lysimeter method were discussed and some recommendations for the use of the micro lysimeters were previously made for our study area kang et al 2003 daily soil evaporation and plant transpiration were calculated as 3 e 10 w π r 2 4 t e t a e where e is the daily soil evaporation mm t is plant transpiration mm δw is the weight difference of the micro lysimeter between two successive dates and r is the inner radius cm of the micro lysimeter 2 3 4 leaf area index summer maize leaf area index lai was measured every 7 10 days after emergence three representative maize plants were randomly selected in every plot at each sampling time and the leaf length and maximum leaf width of each leaf were measured using a flexible ruler the leaf area of each leaf was calculated as the product of leaf length maximum leaf width and a coefficient of 0 75 maize lai was calculated using the following equation wang et al 2021 5 lai n p i 1 n i 1 m l i w i 0 75 n a where lai is the leaf area index n p is the number of total maize plants in the test plot n is the number of sampled maize plants 3 m is the number of leaves measured on a plant a is the test plot area m2 and l and w are the length and width m respectively of a measured leaf 2 3 5 water use efficiency the water use efficiency wue of summer maize was calculated as 6 wue y 10 e t a where wue kg m 3 is the water use efficiency of summer maize y kg ha 1 is the maize yield and et a is the total growing season evapotranspiration of maize mm 2 4 statistical analysis a one way analysis of variance anova was used to examine the differences in soil water consumption maize transpiration soil water evaporation evapotranspiration maize yields and wue by using spss statistics 22 0 at a significance level of 0 05 statistically significant comparisons were identified using least significant difference lsd tests 3 results 3 1 soil water storage the sws in the 0 120 cm soil profile for summer maize significantly increased with increasing irrigation amount and fluctuated with increasing days after planting fig 4 the full irrigation treatment ck had higher sws values than the other treatments during the summer maize growing season sws for ck varied from 192 mm to 311 mm in 2018 from 191 mm to 298 mm in 2019 and from 170 mm to 275 mm in 2020 in contrast the most water deficit treatment t2 values of sws fluctuated in the range of 182 242 mm in 2018 170 245 mm in 2019 and 173 235 mm in 2020 furthermore sws for treatments with lower irrigation amounts in each growth stage were usually lower than for the other irrigation treatments at the end of each growth stage period during v12 r1 in 2018 sws for every treatment increased by about 20 mm because precipitation on 58 days after planting came before the rain shelter could be closed the changes in sws reflected the water consumption of summer maize for all of the treatments sws declined more sharply during v6 v12 v12 r1 and the early stages of r1 r6 the sws of the treatments with greater irrigation amounts changed more especially during the periods of high water consumption of summer maize for the treatments with low irrigation amounts sws changed more slowly especially when sws reached a critical value in the later part of each growth stage period furthermore it can be seen that the lowest value of sws during each growth stage period for lower irrigation amount treatments gradually decreased as the growing season progressed 3 2 spatio temporal dynamics of soil water during summer maize growing seasons 3 2 1 soil water content dynamic change of swc differed with soil depth and maize growth stage fig 5 as maize growth stage progressed swc changed and reached a maximum at middle and later stage showing a gradual increase in water consumption by summer maize swc in the topsoil decreased faster and soil water change rate decreased with increasing soil depth we found that shallow soil tended to dry first and then those dry conditions gradually advanced to deeper soil swc at different soil depths showed significant distribution differences due to different irrigation amounts for the three summer maize growing seasons fig 5 large amounts of irrigation water can cause deep water percolation and can decrease maize water use efficiency especially during the middle and late growth stages under the full irrigation treatment ck deep water percolation below the 100 cm soil depth was observed during growth stages v12 r1 and r1 r6 fig 5a 6b in contrast di caused a concentration of soil water in shallow soil soil water often changed at the 60 cm soil depth for the treatments that included a period with di at 0 6et and the soil remained dry for a long time during the later growth stages e g such as v6 to r6 with t2 v12 to r1 with t4 and t6 r1 to r6 with t3 and t7 etc 3 2 2 soil water consumption rate the soil profile was divided into six layers 0 20 21 40 41 60 61 80 81 100 101 120 cm to analyze the soil water consumption rate wcr of summer maize in each soil layer under different irrigation levels fig 6 seasonal patterns of wcr were observed with increasing maize growth stage and the increase in the size of the root system in all three growing seasons the main water consumption layer of the soil increased over time wcr increased rapidly from v3 to v6 and from v6 to v12 remained at higher values during v12 r1 followed by a gradual decrease during r1 r6 for the full irrigation treatment we observed that from planting to v6 wcr mainly occurred in the 0 40 cm soil layer and the fluctuation range and average value of wcr decreased with increasing soil depth take 2018 as an example in the 0 20 cm and 21 40 cm soil layers the wcr ranges were 0 01 1 56 mm d 1 average 0 54 mm d 1 and 0 06 0 92 mm d 1 average 0 39 mm d 1 respectively during v6 v12 the soil layer that produced soil water consumption gradually extended to the 60 cm depth also average wcr continued to increase to 1 18 1 01 and 0 49 mm d 1 for the three respective soil depths during v12 r1 the soil layer that produced wcr gradually extended to the 80 cm soil depth with an average wcr of 0 22 mm d 1 wcr values increased to their highest values in other soil layers 0 60 cm during r1 r6 average wcr values gradually decreased to 0 67 0 46 0 28 and 0 20 mm d 1 in the four respective soil layers the different irrigation amounts affected the soil water distribution in different soil layers and thus also affected wcr wcr in different soil layers could be decreased under di the greater values decreased with increasing deficit degree for example during stages v3 to v6 under the lower irrigation treatments mean wcr in the 0 40 cm soil layer decreased by 22 8 39 2 for the 0 8 eta treatment and by 33 7 78 6 for the 0 6 eta treatment 3 3 cumulative soil water consumption characteristics cumulative soil water consumption in the 0 20 cm surface soil layer table 3 was the largest of all of the layers 125 0 153 7 mm accounting for 42 8 58 6 of the total soil water consumption for the different irrigation treatments in 2018 the respective values were 115 4 137 3 mm and 39 9 51 2 in 2019 and 92 8 112 1 mm and 42 5 53 5 in 2020 cumulative soil water consumption gradually decreased with increasing soil depth for all of the irrigation treatments in the amounts of 30 2 37 6 3 8 19 0 0 1 7 7 and 0 4 1 3 for the 21 40 cm 41 60 cm 61 80 cm and 81 100 cm soil layers respectively in 2018 32 4 37 9 10 1 22 7 0 5 5 8 and 0 2 1 4 in 2019 and 34 4 40 6 7 1 19 4 0 5 5 8 and 0 3 0 1 in 2020 more than 92 1 of the water consumption was concentrated in the 0 60 cm soil layer and very little water was consumed by summer maize below the 80 cm soil depth varied irrigation amounts affected the soil water consumption amount in different soil layers table 3 the cumulative soil water consumption values in the 0 20 21 40 and 41 60 cm soil layers with ck treatment were significantly p 0 05 higher than t2 treatments and slightly higher than the others treatments there were no significant differences p 0 05 in soil water consumption among the others treatments soil water consumption amount in the 61 80 cm soil depth in 2018 and 2019 with t8 treatment was higher than t7 treatment and significantly p 0 05 higher than the others treatments indicating that continuous water stress during v3 v6 and v6 v12 growth stages promoted the absorption of deep soil water by maize after full irrigation during later growth stages as for the soil water consumption amount below the 80 cm soil depth there were no significant differences p 0 05 3 4 daily evapotranspiration eta and soil evaporation e summer maize eta was successfully calculated using swc values recorded by the tdr 310s sensors as seen in the comparison with eta obtained from the large weighing lysimeters over the three growing seasons fig 7 the regression slopes between the two methods were 0 96 r2 0 95 in 2019 and 0 91 r2 0 93 in 2018 fig 7b daily actual evapotranspiration under the different irrigation treatments during the 2018 2020 maize growing seasons is presented in fig 8 seasonal variations in eta were observed during all three years of the study with lower values from planting to v3 that increased rapidly during v3 v6 and v6 v12 and then remained at higher values during v12 r1 eta decreased gradually during r1 r6 during planting v3 soil evaporation accounted for a large proportion of eta due to small lai and variations in eta were mainly associated with meteorological factors and swc i e eta decreased as surface soil moisture gradually declined due to the gradual increase in lai as maize developed transpiration gradually took over as the main proportion of eta eta initially increased and then decreased during each growth stage period v3 v6 v6 v12 v12 r1 mainly due to the accelerated growth and increased lai that occurred after irrigation at the beginning of each growth stage period during the later part of each growth stage period eta declined as plants were subjected to increasing water stress as soil water gradually declined di significantly reduced eta during the water deficit stages fig 8 when irrigation was reduced 20 and 40 mean daily eta was reduced by 0 45 mm d 1 15 2 and 0 99 mm d 1 33 8 respectively in 2018 and reduced by 0 40 mm d 1 15 9 and 0 65 mm d 1 25 7 respectively in 2019 during v3 v6 eta was reduced by 0 55 0 88 mm d 1 11 6 17 4 and 1 68 2 00 mm d 1 in 2018 and reduced by 0 35 0 72 mm d 1 9 6 17 2 and 0 95 1 55 mm d 1 26 1 36 8 in 2019 during v6 v12 for the same two respective reductions in irrigation amounts v12 r1 is a critical growth stage period for water demand water deficits during this stage accelerate the aging process of leaves significantly reducing the evapotranspiration rate during this period mean daily eta was reduced by 0 54 mm d 1 9 8 and 2 29 mm d 1 41 6 in 2018 and by 1 29 mm d 1 18 0 and 3 46 mm d 1 48 5 in 2019 during this period when water deficit was 20 and 40 respectively during r1 r6 eta decreased over time due to decreasing air temperature and solar radiation fig 2 and the gradual aging of plants resulting in smaller eta differences between the water deficit treatments during the entire summer maize growing season daily e values for the full irrigation treatment ranged from 0 10 to 2 06 mm d 1 average 0 76 mm d 1 during planting v3 from 0 82 to 3 37 mm d 1 average 1 86 mm d 1 during v3 v6 from 1 10 to 2 58 mm d 1 average 1 74 mm d 1 during v6 v12 from 0 21 to 2 20 mm d 1 average 1 22 mm d 1 during v12 r1 and from 0 12 to 1 21 mm d 1 average 0 54 mm d 1 during r1 r6 in 2018 daily soil water evaporation gradually decreased from v3 to v6 to r1 r6 and similar characteristics were observed in the other two years of the experiment fig 8 also the effects of di on e were less than on eta di reduced e to a certain extent in each growth stage period when irrigation was reduced 20 and 40 in 2018 mean daily e was reduced by 0 23 mm d 1 12 2 and 0 47 mm d 1 25 7 respectively during v3 v6 0 12 mm d 1 5 8 and 0 32 mm d 1 16 4 during v6 v12 0 05 mm d 1 4 0 and 0 13 mm d 1 9 7 during v12 r1 and 0 07 mm d 1 13 6 and 0 22 mm d 1 41 7 during r1 r6 the same pattern was observed in 2019 and 2020 after irrigation applications soil evaporation for treatments subjected to water stress in the earlier growth stage periods was usually greater than soil evaporation observed in the full irrigation treatment 3 5 soil evaporation e and transpiration t during different maize growth stage periods values of e and t for each growth stage and total eta consistently increased as the total amount of irrigation increased table 4 during v3 v6 irrigation had a great influence on e the soil evaporation values with 100 eta irrigation treatments were significantly p 0 05 higher than 80 and 60 eta irrigation treatments the transpiration t values with 60 eta irrigation treatments were significantly lower than the others treatments there were no significant differences p 0 05 in t between 100 and 80 eta irrigation treatments during the middle and later growth stages irrigation had a significantly p 0 05 influence on t but only limited effects on e for instance the ranges for t were 47 0 95 9 mm and 26 6 55 6 mm for the different irrigation treatments during v12 r1 and r1 r6 respectively in contrast e ranged from only 23 9 mm to 31 1 mm and from 8 5 mm to 15 5 mm respectively during these two stages the effects on e and t of restoring an adequate water supply after maize had suffered different degrees of water stress in the previous growth stage period were different we found that soil water evaporation tended to increase while crop transpiration decreased after maize was irrigated with full water following a period of severe water stress before consider for example ck t3 and t6 irrigated with 100 80 and 60 et respectively during v3 v6 all three treatments subsequently received the same irrigation amount 100 et during v6 v12 and e was 1 8 mm and 2 8 mm greater for t3 and t6 respectively than for ck while t was 2 7 mm and 5 0 mm respectively less than for ck in 2018 similar results for the change characteristics of e and t were observed for other maize growth stages t accounted for 55 9 67 5 57 4 69 0 and 54 5 67 4 of the total water consumption in 2018 2019 and 2020 respectively and was the main consumption component for the entire summer maize growing season t and t eta increased gradually as the growing season progressed fig 9 with values of t eta of 8 1 33 4 40 6 48 1 67 9 66 3 78 2 and 75 8 82 0 during planting v3 v3 v6 v6 v12 v12 r1 r1 r6 respectively in 2018 7 0 32 1 35 7 60 3 72 9 67 5 80 7 and 75 2 79 4 in 2019 and 13 6 35 7 43 9 47 7 68 2 57 9 76 3 and 77 1 82 2 in 2020 the changes in e eta over time were opposite to the changes in t eta over time 3 6 yield and water use efficiency across all treatments maize yields ranged from 5168 5 to 8302 9 kg ha 1 4876 7 to 7874 5 kg ha 1 and 4638 0 to 6723 6 kg ha 1 in 2018 2019 and 2020 respectively table 5 the ck treatment clearly had the highest yield while t2 had the lowest yield varying degrees of water deficit affected maize yields to different extents maize yields for t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 and t8 were significantly p 0 05 lower by 37 8 5 6 7 9 11 6 20 7 18 2 and 19 9 respectively than for the ck treatment in 2018 and lower by 40 2 18 7 17 7 15 8 26 3 23 8 and 26 6 in 2019 treatments t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 and t8 were significantly p 0 05 lower by 29 8 31 0 20 4 29 7 20 1 and 32 3 respectively in 2020 maize yields for t1 decreased by 3 3 8 0 p 0 05 in the three growing seasons and yields under t3 were also close to ck yields in 2018 and 2020 severe water deficit during v3 v6 also affected crop yield to a certain extent t6 t7 t8 t3 t4 t5 ck t1 wue values ranged from 2 48 to 2 96 kg m 3 in 2018 2 18 to 2 58 kg m 3 in 2019 and 2 47 to 2 85 kg m 3 in 2020 table 5 higher wue values were observed in 2018 than in the other years primarily because some rainwater fell on the plots during v12 r1 in addition to the influence of meteorological factors resulting in greater yield and wue for the treatments suffering from water stress during this stage the t2 treatment had the lowest wue due to continuous di of 40 eta during the last three growth stage periods that resulted in extremely low yield in all three years the ck treatment did not have the largest wue despite having the greatest yield because of ineffective water consumption the highest wue in 2018 and 2019 was observed for t4 that had full irrigation during r1 r6 showing that adequate irrigation during the grain filling stage could effectively improve wue wue for t1 was 5 5 7 5 greater than for ck although yield for t1 was 3 3 8 0 lower than for ck this result demonstrates the potential of improving maize wue by using a moderate di application strategy at different developmental stages 4 discussion 4 1 temporal and spatial characteristics of soil water for summer maize 4 1 1 soil water distribution characteristics precipitation was excluded with a rain shelter in this experiment making irrigation the main source of water for consumption by et distribution characteristics of swc in the soil profile and sws depend on the water balance between the irrigation amount and water consumption the profile water distributions differed in our study because of the different irrigation water application amounts fig 5 determining reasonable irrigation amounts is important for establishing proper water distribution in soil for uptake by the maize root system yang et al 2018 under the full irrigation treatment a large amount of the irrigation water applied could not be utilized effectively by maize because of direct infiltration into the deep soil layer beyond the maize root system as observed in our previous study xu et al 2020 in contrast applications of less irrigation water can cause uneven distribution of water and lead to long periods of dry soil conditions fig 5 that adversely affect normal growth of crops effectively reducing deep percolation and increasing the efficient use of soil water is vital for improving the utilization efficiency of irrigation water in irrigated farmland chen et al 2020 xu et al 2020 according to our results the appropriate amount of irrigation water required for summer maize production should be controlled in the top 80 cm of the soil profile this conclusion is similar to the result reported by wu et al 2016 under furrow irrigation using isotope methods 4 1 2 soil water consumption rate characteristics soil water redistribution occurred within 1 3 days following irrigation and the reduction in soil water was partly due to et and partly due to the movement of soil water during the water redistribution process therefore soil water consumption in the upper layers was overestimated by evapotranspiration during the several days after irrigation soil water consumption was the result of two forcing actions water consumption in the surface soil layers was dependent on water absorption by roots and soil water evaporation while water consumption in deeper soil layers occurred in response to only water absorption by roots obvious seasonal patterns of wcr were mostly related to root growth and distribution characteristics at different maize growth stages wu et al 2016 during the early growth stage period we found that wcr occurred from as deep as 40 cm deeper than the 20 cm thickness of the general evaporation layer fig 6 mainly because a soil water potential gradient established between the upper dry surface and deeper wet layers promoted capillary rise of water in response to evaporative demand jha et al 2017 li et al 2010 as maize growth stage progressed and the root system gradually developed wcr gradually increased and extended to deeper soil we observed that wcr in the top soil layers fluctuated affected by solar radiation and gradually decreased over time in every irrigation cycle because wcr was very sensitive to swc wang et al 2020a with wcr gradually declining with decreasing swc it is worth noting that during every irrigation cycle before r1 wcr in the top layer decreased and wcr in the deeper layers gradually increased these changes were mainly because swc in the top soil layer declined faster than in the deeper soil layers fig 6 and the declining soil water availability likely stimulated root extension into deeper soil wu et al 2016 thus increasing the utilization of deeper 21 60 cm soil water above ground plant organs began senescing during r1 r6 and wcr in different soil layers gradually declined during this time the wcr fluctuation pattern in deeper soil layers was very consistent with what was observed in the top soil layer fig 6 irrigation had a significant effect on wcr in our study because maize root absorption characteristics were greatly influenced by swc wu et al 2016 because wcr is sensitive to swc wcr in different soil layers was found to be comparatively high for the full irrigation treatment which had higher available soil water compared with other di treatments wcr declined under moderate water deficit conditions but wcr in both upper and deeper layers was rapidly restored to the full irrigation treatment level and even exceeded that level after rewatering irrigation was applied fig 6 especially in the early growth stage period this was mainly because the inactive roots caused by dry soil conditions in the upper soil layers quickly recovered activity after the next irrigation was applied green and clothier 1995 wang et al 2020a moderate soil water deficit could also stimulate the root system to extend into deeper soil layers peng et al 2022 wu et al 2016 and thereby increase soil water absorption by deeper roots therefore using the compensating effects of root growth and differing distribution patterns of water absorption could effectively increase the utilization of deep soil water and nutrients in order to achieve the goal of saving irrigation water in actual agricultural production 4 1 3 soil water consumption characteristics from different soil layers the maize root system is fibrous and it is the key bridge between the plant and the soil root system distribution characteristics are an important indicator of maize root water uptake zhang et al 2022a as maize grows and develops the main depth of water absorption and the proportion of deep water consumed gradually increased as a previous analysis of wcr has shown where deep roots developed and played an important role in contributing to water absorption in the deep layers of the soil profile li et al 2011 showed that maize roots were mainly distributed in the 20 60 cm soil layer during the middle growth stage periods and the soil layer with the maximum root density was 40 80 cm during the late growth stage period additionally summer maize increased the utilization of middle layer 21 60 cm soil water during the middle and late growing season thus according to the results of our study the appropriate wetting depth for maize production is suggested to be 40 cm before v6 60 cm during v6 v12 and 80 cm during v12 r6 these results are similar to findings with furrow irrigation for maize previously reported by wu et al 2016 with regard to total soil water consumption from different soil depths throughout the entire maize growing season the results showed that maize absorbed a large proportion of water from the surface soil layer after irrigation events about 39 9 58 6 of maize water depletion was from the 0 20 cm soil layer as also reported by wang et al 2010 wang et al 2020a the main uptake zone was the top 20 cm of the soil profile because of higher root length density in this layer as described by qi et al 2018 additionally soil water consumption in the upper soil layer mainly depends on both water absorption by roots and evaporative demand and most of the evaporation water consumption occurred in the 0 20 cm soil layer water absorption in the lower regions from 21 to 40 cm and from 41 to 60 cm ranged from 30 2 to 40 6 and from 3 8 to 22 7 respectively of the total water consumption based on the three study years only 0 0 7 7 of the total water consumption was from the 61 80 cm soil layer and water absorption below 80 cm was almost negligible soil water consumption in the 0 60 cm soil layer accounted for more than 92 of the total water consumption wang et al 2010 also found that maize mainly utilized soil water from the 0 50 cm layer during the entire growing season using an isotope method previous studies have shown that the 0 60 cm soil layer was the primary zone of maize root growth and distribution liao et al 2014 peng et al 2012 there were no obvious differences for soil water consumption in the surface soil layer due to di treatments but more and more differences gradually developed with increasing soil depth soil water consumption in a deeper 61 80 cm soil layer increased after full irrigation during later growth stages when maize suffered from different degrees of water stress during multiple continuous growth stages this situation was observed for the t7 and t8 treatments indicating that roots continuously extended into deeper depths so that plants could survive when subjected to continuing water stress even so soil water consumption in different soil layers gradually decreased overall as irrigation amount decreased crop demand and soil water supply lead to dynamic changes in the main water absorption layers zhang et al 2022a in our study irrigation was the only source of water for maize and the distribution of water in the soil determined the amount of water absorption the higher availability of water in the upper soil profile compared with deeper layers resulted in higher water absorption and water consumption proportion for the di treatments table 3 4 2 evapotranspiration characteristics 4 2 1 soil water evaporation and evapotranspiration soil water evaporation is usually considered to be ineffective water loss and reducing soil water evaporation can actually decrease water loss from farmland and improve crop wue daily soil water evaporation fluctuated in our study and gradually decreased during v3 r6 fig 8 the proportion of evaporation the evaporation fraction was greatest during the initial growth stage period and then decreased during crop development this result was consistent with results reported by ding et al 2013 wang et al 2020b yu et al 2016 for maize and for other crops liu et al 2022 zhao et al 2015 soil water and lai are the most important factors influencing soil water evaporation jiang et al 2016 liu et al 2002 soil water evaporation is the main component of eta during the initial crop growth stage period because swc is sufficient to respond to the actual evaporative demand during this period as lai increases water loss through maize stomata increases wen et al 2016 and t increases to become the main source of eta transpiration in our study increased with increasing lai during v3 r1 and declined with leaf senescence during r1 r6 irrigation had a stronger effect on maize t than on e in our study and similar results were reported by wang et al 2020c for winter wheat under di decreasing irrigation amounts resulted in lower swc especially in deep soil and caused leaf stomatal conductance to decrease once subjected to water stress resulting in decreased transpiration however in our study soil water evaporation generally occurred in the top soil layer and was affected by swc and lai di decreased both lai and swc and caused a small fluctuation in e water stress at v3 v6 had little effect on summer maize and eta and t returned to the non water stressed level after the next irrigation even leading to a compensation effect fig 6 table 4 due to the di enhancement of water absorption from deep layers fig 6 the evapotranspiration compensation effect has also been reported for pear jujube trees zizyphus jujube mill feng et al 2017 wheat wang et al 2020a and other plants liu et al 2022 peng et al 2022 however it was difficult for t to return to the non water stressed level when maize suffered different degrees of water stress that occurred after v6 table 4 this was primarily because after v6 maize grew rapidly and needed large amounts of water the subsequent water shortage inhibited plant growth root development and co2 assimilation wang et al 2020c 4 2 2 t eta and e eta for summer maize during each of the three growing seasons of the experiment the e fraction of evapotranspiration e eta over the entire growing season ranged from 31 to 32 5 for the full irrigation treatment these values were greater than the value reported by kang et al 2003 of 26 calculated by the soil water balance method using micro lysimeters and less than the value reported by yu et al 2016 of 36 4 calculated by the direct method in yangling in the guanzhong plain our results were close to observations reported by liu et al 2002 of 30 3 and hu and lei 2021 of 28 for the multi year mean growing season in the north china plain and by ding et al 2013 of 31 for shiyanghe in gansu province of northwest china during the maize growing season e eta changed regularly with the development of lai fig 10 e eta decreased markedly with increasing lai previous studies showed that the relationship between e eta and lai followed the form of an exponential equation brisson et al 1992 liu et al 2002 to explore the effect of di on e eta we analyzed summer maize e eta and lai under 100 80 and 60 et irrigation amounts beginning at v6 for the ck t1 and t2 treatments during 2018 2020 we found that soil water affected e eta demonstrating that sufficient soil water supply decreased e eta especially during the middle and later growth stage periods fig 10 i e e eta decreased with increasing irrigation amounts the same relationship was also be found by jha et al 2017 yu et al 2009 mainly because the adequate water supply significantly increased maize transpiration and significantly increased lai compared with the di treatments fig 10 our results indicated that despite the lower total soil evaporation under di e eta increased to a certain extent therefore from this perspective di was not effective in reducing e et 4 3 evapotranspiration in relation to soil water determining the water threshold that affects eta of crops at different growth stages is vital for irrigation management to eliminate the effect of meteorological factors on eta eta et0 was used to determine the response of eta to soil water eta et0 was found to be related to swc during all maize growth stages and the relationships between eta et0 and swc were quite different at different growth stages fig 11 over the entire maize growing season eta et0 initially increased and then gradually decreased and was closely related to lai changes over time guo et al 2020 han et al 2022 during planting v3 eta et0 showed a linear increasing trend with swc r2 0 21 0 25 fig 11 a1 a3 because eta et0 was dominated by soil evaporation due to the lower lai during this early growth stage period and similar to the effect of soil water on soil evaporation zhang et al 2022b eta et0 was mainly affected by swc at this stage during v3 v6 the relationships between eta et0 and swc followed the form of a quadratic curve r2 0 49 0 52 demonstrating that eta et0 was basically stable as swc became higher than 22 0 72 of field capacity fc eta et0 continuously declined as swc decreased below 22 0 indicating that summer maize would be subject to some degree of water stress when swc was below 22 0 72 of fc at this stage we noted that eta et0 at v6 v12 initially increased and then decreased as swc decreased also following the form of a quadratic curve r2 0 27 0 64 as kang et al 2003 and wang et al 2020d reported eta et0 increased under an adequate soil water supply as lai increased rapidly during this period in our study for the 100 and 80 eta treatments when soil water was below about 22 0 72 of fc eta et0 decreased with decreasing soil water showing the threshold value that affected maize evapotranspiration during v6 v12 to be 22 0 72 of fc similar to what was observed for v3 v6 during v12 r1 and r1 r6 the relationships between eta et0 and swc followed a decreasing logistic relationship for all irrigation treatments and the relationships were slightly different for the two growth stage periods r2 0 57 0 71 and 0 22 0 67 respectively during v12 r1 eta et0 remained at a relatively stable high value as lai reached higher values guo et al 2020 wang et al 2020d until swc decreased to about 18 0 60 of fc at swc less than 18 0 eta et0 decreased rapidly with decreasing soil water indicating that the water deficit threshold during v12 r1 was 60 of fc during r1 r6 eta et0 decreased as swc declined and the decreasing rate was initially slow and then accelerated during this period of decreasing lai eta et0 gradually decreased as the period was prolonged kang et al 2003 it was worth noting that the fitting relationships for treatments t3 t8 during the middle and later growth stage periods had higher r2 values indicating eta et0 for di treatments was more related to soil water consumption 4 4 water consumption and productivity characteristics for summer maize in practice researching soil water absorption depth and amounts eta partitioning characteristics and water productivity under different irrigation treatments can help us understand the proper absorption depth for roots and water use processes and thereby produce more efficient irrigation strategies in irrigated maize cropland yang et al 2018 fig 12 presents a schematic representation of e t total eta and soil water consumption amount w at different soil depths during different summer maize growth stages under the 100 80 and 60 eta irrigation treatments total eta for full irrigation was 324 9 327 9 mm during the growing season during planting v3 14 8 15 8 mm water was consumed as eta of which 13 6 14 7 mm was e soil water consumption amount was 8 6 9 4 mm from the 0 20 cm soil layer and 6 2 6 4 mm from 21 to 40 cm during v3 v6 total eta was 43 7 47 0 mm and 27 3 29 2 16 1 17 4 and 0 3 0 4 mm of soil water came from the 0 20 21 40 and 41 60 mm layers respectively of which 59 4 63 3 came from e during v6 v12 eta was 70 3 79 1 mm and e was 21 4 22 6 mm with 31 4 33 4 27 5 28 5 and 12 4 17 2 mm coming from the 0 20 21 40 and 41 60 mm soil layers respectively during v12 r1 eta was 108 2 122 7 mm and e was 20 9 26 8 mm with 41 9 51 5 36 8 39 9 24 6 26 6 and 4 6 7 4 mm coming from the 0 20 cm 21 40 cm 41 60 and 61 80 cm soil layers respectively during r1 r6 eta declined to 70 8 81 1 mm and e was 14 5 16 7 mm with 23 6 29 8 22 5 22 9 13 4 23 9 4 6 6 4 and 0 9 4 3 mm being absorbed from the respective soil layers when irrigation was reduced by 20 and 40 during v3 v6 eta was reduced to 36 4 39 9 mm and 31 1 32 1 mm respectively water absorption was reduced in the 0 40 cm soil layer but water absorption was increased in the 41 60 cm soil layer during the other maize growth stages irrigation amount decreased water consumption amount in every soil layer gradually decreased soil e loss decreased to varying degrees and e eta increased fig 12 deficit irrigation treatments decreased root water absorption and t eta ratio but also increased water productivity to a certain extent wue was higher for t1 t3 t4 and t5 in 2018 and for t1 and t4 in 2019 compared with ck showing that moderate di in the early growth stage period and adequate or moderate water supply in the middle and later stages could improve wue as similarly reported by attia et al 2021 moderate di could cause partial stomatal closure resulting in reduced transpiration from leaves thereby reducing plant water use with minimal reduction in photosynthesis chai et al 2016 we also found lower wue for t2 due to severe stress compared with the full irrigation amount between v6 and r6 the t8 treatment was subjected to severe water stress during v3 v12 and the result was in accordance with the findings of zou et al 2021 and song et al 2016 severe water deficit during vegetative growth with t8 inhibited vegetative organ development and affected kernel number and kernel weight during reproductive growth li et al 2018 resulting in severe yield reduction during v6 r6 maize suffered successive periods of water stress with t2 that seriously affected crop yield and severely reduced wue overall severe di treatments led to considerable yield losses and lower wues in our study t1 was more effective in using water than ck with wue increased by 5 5 7 4 irrigation amount decreased by 12 3 14 5 and yield decreased by 3 3 8 1 rodrigues et al 2013 also pointed out that moderate di could lead to better water productivity and is generally economically feasible these results indicated the potential for saving water in the region by following a combination of moderate di application at different developmental stages employing moderate di during earlier growth stages followed by full or moderate irrigation during reproductive growth stages could maximize wue 5 conclusions deficit irrigation could be an effective way to increase the utilization efficiency of agricultural water resources however assessing soil water consumption characteristics at different soil depths and separation of evaporation and transpiration under di have not been systematically investigated in this study an irrigation experiment with several different di treatments over three consecutive years was conducted to study the effects of di on the spatio temporal dynamics of soil water and evapotranspiration partitioning in summer maize and to determine water productivity in semi arid northwest china the results of this research demonstrated that about 39 9 58 6 of maize water consumption was from the 0 20 cm soil layer and soil water consumption above a soil depth of 60 cm accounted for more than 92 of the total water consumption the appropriate wetting depth for maize production in this region is suggested to be 40 cm before v6 60 cm during v6 v12 and 80 cm during v12 r6 irrigation amount greatly influenced maize water consumption compared with full irrigation di affected soil water distribution and availability and thus reduced wcr and root water absorption amount moderate water deficit during v3 v6 could stimulate root extension into deeper soil layers and increase water absorption from deeper layers swc could be rapidly restored to the full irrigation level and could even exceed the non water stressed level after a subsequent irrigation reflecting a compensatory effect of root water absorption di had a stronger effect on maize t than on soil e even though di decreased total soil evaporation amount it increased e eta and wue the threshold soil water value for defining when summer maize was subjected to water stress was 22 0 72 of fc during v3 v12 and 18 0 60 of fc during v12 r1 this study was limited by the potential bias regarding soil evaporation that may have occurred by using measurements from micro lysimeters placed between two crop rows also deep percolation was not taken into account during the estimation of actual eta further research should consider the use of a correction factor to more accurately estimate soil evaporation and to consider deep percolation when estimating actual eta in the field despite the study s limitations these findings help us to better understand maize water utilization characteristics and water productivity under di and help to make effective water management decision for agricultural production in arid areas of northwest china furthermore it should be noted that water utilization characteristics and productivity under di may become more complicated under future climate change conditions a better understanding of water utilization and productivity response to climate change will require further investigations in the

2301,erosion of agricultural land endangers the livelihood of millions of people who depend on natural resources soil and water conservation practices swcp are intended to reduce runoff production and erosion understanding surface runoff drivers are crucial for the effective design and implementation of swcps we present field observations of complex vertical soil profiles and variations in lithology along hillslopes ridge channel transects from the debre mawi watershed in the upper abay blue nile basin of the ethiopian highlands our study generates the first depth and hillslope distributed soil water retention curves textural profiles and measures of hydraulic conductivity for the region we provide guidance into preferred pedotransfer functions ptfs and their sensitivity to clay fraction hydrological processes associated with the observed vertical profiles and variations on them were simulated with the hydrus 2d software package revealing that dominant runoff generation mechanisms were sensitive to the vertical organization of soil texture particularly at depths of 30 cm or more below the soil surface for soil profiles that have well drained surface soil textures this suggests that current practices of evaluating soil properties based on surface texture only is insufficient for understanding hillslope hydrology and mitigating soil erosion in these regions in regions where comprehensive soil hydraulic profile data is not available our study quantifies the uncertainties in both ptfs and hydrological fluxes due to variation of soil profile texture present these can aid decision makers in data collection and accounting of errors for the intended application of interest keywords soil hydraulic property soil erosion runoff hydrus program conservation ethiopian highlands data availability the data that support the findings of this study are openly available in hydroshare at the following url https doi org 10 4211 hs 9170fbd4f5de4c029728c815d9b37590 1 introduction soils are responsible for a multitude of ecosystem services amundson et al 2015 and are particularly important for provisioning of food raw materials and water supply regulation of climate energy nutrient and water cycles and supporting services such as the creation of habitat adhikari and hartemink 2016 yet globally most of the world s soils are degraded and likely to experience further degradation montanarella et al 2016 threatening soils ability to provide these services and the well being of the societies and ecosystems depending on them impacts of soil loss from agriculture include reductions in productivity pimentel et al 1976 bossio et al 2010 fensholt et al 2013 exacerbation of climate change owens 2020 and reduced water security due to loss of water holding capacity in the top soil and sedimentation of river channels and reservoirs falkenmark et al 1989 globally erosion is the greatest threat to soils erosion is closely tied to agricultural practices with the highest rates of soil loss associated with the least developed economies borrelli et al 2017 the burden of soil erosion in the least developed nations is likely to worsen because these nations are most likely to expand croplands global estimates of erosion suggest that the great majority of soil loss is attributable to wind or water processes with water erosion estimated to have caused 35 9 pg yr 1 of soil loss globally in 2012 borrelli et al 2017 water erosion and runoff however can be driven by distinctly different hydrological phenomena saffarpour et al 2016 which may indicate different forms of intervention and prevention where overland flow on dry soils is the major driver of erosion as is typically the case in arid environments mitigation methods must focus on preventing runoff from being formed and slowing and detaining runoff on the landscape rivas 2006 such methods promote the infiltration of water into the soil yet soil saturation can itself drive erosion particularly in humid climates or steep landscapes overland flow produced on saturated soils is often a significant contributor to gully erosion saturated soil conditions reduce the cohesion of particles exacerbating erosion huang et al 2007 and subsurface seepage flows promote head cutting of gullies causing them to migrate up slope wetter conditions homogenize soil preventing heterogeneity in soil moisture from mitigating erosion fitzjohn et al 1998 increasing water inputs infiltration in up slope areas can worsen gully erosion down slope by increasing the risk of saturation adopting treatments that slow detain or infiltrate water near areas prone to saturation is unlikely to be effective in mitigating soil loss instead a range of diversion stabilization and de saturation approaches are needed shilton et al 2015 selecting and designing suitable interventions in landscapes that could produce runoff through multiple pathways requires understanding the hydrological drivers of erosion zimale et al 2017 at the catena scale this understanding depends on having enough information about soil properties to infer the dominant runoff generation mechanisms globally the decades since the year 2000 have seen the production of new high resolution digital soil maps mcbratney et al 2014 adhikari and hartemink 2016 keesstra et al 2016 the high dimensionality and multi scale variability and non stationary nature of many soil properties however continues to pose significant challenges to soil mapping in particular large scale soil maps tend to omit information about the soil profile for example more than half of the available digital soil maps reviewed by chen et al 2022 cover only the surface 0 3 m of soils deeper soil profile information is important for characterizing hydrological behavior rubio et al 1997 šanda et al 2006 beven 1991 in particular the potential for soil saturation on hillslopes deep soil profile information also regulates soil carbon stocks plant water availability and other ecosystem services baveye et al 2016 jonsson et al 2017 kelleway et al 2017 consequently incorporating information about soil characteristics deeper than surface soils in regional mapping remains an important challenge lal 2018 at one extreme of such an approach is a comprehensive depth distributed map of physical and chemical parameters across typically hydrologically or ecologically active soil layers similar to the usgs ssurgo soil product fortner et al 2006 ssurgo however such soil mapping products represent enormous investments in local soil surveying data aggregation and database management an investment which is beyond the capacity of many of the locations where soil data is most urgently needed an alternative approach to mapping everything is to map enough to consider key decisions that will be made with soil datasets and the minimum quantum of information needed to make those decisions with an acceptable level of certainty such approaches have the potential to reduce the burden of data collection needed to inform decision making soil texture and soil hydraulic properties strongly influence which erosion mechanisms are most likely to occur and thus usefully inform the design of erosion control measures runoff response and erosion behavior are sensitive to the characteristics of the surface soil layer the vertical layering of different soil characteristics through the profile mirus and loague 2013 lu and godt 2013 zhang et al 2014 and the organization of this vertical structure changes along the hillslope catena brunner et al 2004 while the trends of soil development thickness and horizonation are sometimes predictable across landscapes and along hillslopes hall and olson 1991 patton et al 2018 this is not always the case in regions where the soil profile saturation controls runoff generation mechanism lack of soil profile texture and hydraulic properties negatively impacts accurate estimation of runoff and the consequent erosion for example erosion in the ethiopian humid highlands is driven by both surface and subsurface runoff processes setegn et al 2009 tilahun et al 2014 practitioners designing soil and water conservation practices in the ethiopian highlands face significant resource constraints meaning that fully characterizing soil profiles vertically and along hillslopes is rarely possible instead erosion risk and the suitability of different soil and water conservation practices are usually evaluated from surface soil texture alone this approach precludes assessment of vertical and hillslope scale variations in soil texture and requires the use of pedotransfer functions ptfs to estimate soil hydraulic properties patil and singh 2016 yet ptf development and testing remains limited in many of the most erosion threatened nations bayabil et al 2019 although site specific validation is recommended when using ptfs patil and singh 2016 bayabil et al 2019 botula et al 2012 to date no such evaluation has been applied in the ethiopian highlands here we attempt to establish what might constitute enough soil profile information to characterize runoff generation mechanisms and inform erosion control approaches using a well studied catchment within the ethiopian humid highlands as a case study region the ethiopian highlands are attractive as a case study due to their severe exposure to soil erosion the limited existing soil profile information in the region and the variability in erosion mechanisms across the landscape in the region high population density steep slope cultivation high rainfall and soil erosion rates with low available resources for soil profile data collection are not unique to the ethiopian highlands consequently inappropriate design of soil and water conservation interventions have hindered adoption of conservation practices in east africa and parts of central america in the past pretty and shah 1997 hellin and ridaura 2016 findings here are thus both locally relevant in the ethiopian highlands for management and also illustrate how soil information can inform soil and water conservation strategies globally we present a characterization of soil textural and hydraulic properties in this data scarce area to reveal heterogeneous vertical structure and variation of the soil profile at different hillslope positions in a 95 ha semi humid watershed in the ethiopian highlands while our data collection is too limited to fully characterize the critical zone soil profile of the study area we use the soil data obtained to i explore the implications of the observed vertical structure of the soils for hydrological and erosion risks ii quantify the risk of mis specifying erosion and hydrological process understanding based on typical practices including evaluating only surface soil textural properties and using ptfs at these sites and iii to suggest some simple rules of thumb for identifying the most likely dominant runoff generation mechanisms based on vertical soil texture profiles for appropriate soil and water conservation practices in the ethiopian humid highlands and similar regions in the world in doing so we aim to fill the knowledge gap regarding what information is most valuable based on the soil characteristics we could reveal for decision making related to runoff and erosion production 2 methods 2 1 study area 2 1 1 the ethiopian highlands the ethiopian highlands experience some of the most dramatic rates of soil erosion in the world estimated mean rates of soil loss vary but are regularly in excess of 10 kg m 2 yr 1 birhanu 2014 sonneveld et al 2011 while measured erosion rates in research watersheds can reach up to 20 kg m 2 yr 1 haregeweyn et al 2017 rapid erosion is driven by high intensity annual rainfall exceeding 2000 mm year viste and sorteberg 2013 where 50 to 80 of it occurs between june and september korecha and barnston 2007 extensive deforestation birhanu 2014 grepperud 1996 abate et al 2017 rainfed cultivation on steep slopes and overgrazing zeleke and hurni 2001 repeated cultivation also leads to loss of soil carbon enhancing the formation of hardpans tebebu et al 2017 by reducing deep infiltration hardpans increase saturation of shallow soils promote overland runoff and erosion tesemma et al 2010 and reduce dry season baseflow enku and melesse 2014 the highlands represent approximately 90 of the arable land in ethiopia house approximately 90 of the population and support 60 of livestock hurni et al 2010 this primarily agrarian economy is exposed and vulnerable to the consequences of soil loss erosion in the ethiopian humid highlands is primarily driven by both surface and subsurface runoff processes setegn et al 2009 tilahun et al 2014 watershed scale analyses indicate that some 17 of a representative watershed area was at risk of significant erosion due to overland flow processes mostly in the uplands while 2 of the same watershed was at high risk of erosion due to saturation of the soil promoting gullying mhiret et al 2019 however readily available tools for predicting erosion risk such as the revised universal soil loss equation rusle are more sensitive to risks of overland flow than gully formation ghosal and bhattacharya 2020 field measurements suggest that gully erosion on saturated soils is the most significant driver of soil loss in the region tebebu et al 2010 zegeye et al 2014 predictability of soil profile characterization is limited in the ethiopian highlands due to its geological and geomorphic history in addition to very few soil landscape studies present the parent materials for the soils of the lake tana basin within the larger abay basin for example were created by the convergence of three grabens chorowicz et al 1998 repeated eruptions of lava produced by shield volcanoes mohr 1983 fluvial erosion of these uplifted basalts filling of the lacustrine plain and river valleys with alluvial sediments and subsequent recession of the lake margins poppe et al 2013 the soils that formed vary from shrink swell clays to red well drained clay loams setegn et al 2010 weathering and erosion of this landscape results in the exposure of different soil layers at different locations on hillslopes producing highly variable vertical profiles for example soil profile measurements in the lake tana basin made by colot et al 2012 and beyene et al 2018 both show considerable variability in soil texture of the same horizon across different study locations 2 1 2 debre mawi watershed the study took place in the debre mawi watershed a 95 ha watershed located in the upper abay blue nile basin of the ethiopian highlands 37 22 e and 11 18 n see fig 1 debre mawi experiences a monsoonal tropical climate with a mean annual temperature of 20 c and 900 mm mean june to october rainfall 2010 2016 which accounts for 80 85 of mean annual rainfall zegeye et al 2016 the watershed is located between elevations of 2195 to 2308 m with maximum slope of 30 dagnew et al 2015 the soil which is underlain by an impermeable layer abiy 2009 varies from 0 58 to 2 96 m in depth in the mid slopes region to 2 8 to 3 92 m depth on the down slopes and 0 95 to 2 28 m depth at the crest guzman et al 2017 tilahun et al 2016 the watershed area is mostly comprised of relatively shallow soils typical of up slope and mid slope locations typically for the region shallow soils are predominantly used for rainfed cropping particularly teff eragrostis tef corn zea mays finger millet eleusine coracana barley triticum sp and wheat triticum aestivum abiy 2009 tilahun 2012 tebebu et al 2010 the down slopes are used for pasture the debre mawi watershed has been the subject of soil water and agricultural research since 2010 runoff in the watershed is mostly produced by saturation excess on poorly drained down slopes tilahun et al 2016 at the beginning of the wet season rill erosion from recently ploughed agricultural land is important but as the wet season progresses and the land saturates active gullies become more important sediment sources tilahun et al 2014 cumulative soil loss due to rill erosion ranges from 1 7 kg m 2 from in the up slope region to 20 kg m 2 from the down slope region tilahun et al 2014 while gully erosion produces between 12 kg m 2 tilahun 2012 and 53 kg m 2 tebebu et al 2010 the long research history of debre mawi combined with its proximity 10 km to a national meteorological station at adet means that valuable ancillary datasets are available to characterize the site including weather hydrometric and sediment concentration mhiret et al 2020 soil physical properties consisting of soil penetration resistance particle size soil organic matter som ph base ions cation exchange capacity cec silica content bulk density moisture content tebebu et al 2017 infiltration rates tilahun et al 2014 and water table levels guzman et al 2017 however soil hydraulic properties such as the saturated hydraulic conductivity and soil water retention curve and their spatial variations along hillslopes and through the soil profile have not been characterized a variety of soil and water conservation practices have been trialed to mitigate erosion in the debre mawi watershed these included both physical structures soil bunds with infiltration ditches stone bunds and stone faced soil bunds and biological intervention planting of trees such as sasbania sasbania grandiflora and elephant grass pennistum purpureum mhiret et al 2020 their impacts have been mixed for instance in the mid slopes the installation of a soil bund increased infiltration and locally reduced runoff and sediment loads a similar installation in the toe slope region however produced a 4 meter wide and 56 meter long gully over a six year period mhiret et al 2020 enhancing infiltration up slope overall may also have contributed to saturation and gully formation in the down slopes gullying in the down slopes increased following installation of soil and water conservation practices in debre mawi herweg and ludi 1999 tilahun et al 2014 zegeye et al 2016 because gullies generate 90 of the sediment loss from the debre mawi watershed the overall rate of soil loss worsened following interventions intended to prevent it tebebu et al 2010 zegeye et al 2018 even though runoff was reduced locally around the installed infrastructure this history illuminates the risks associated with intervening in hillslope scale hydrological processes to reduce erosion risk without fully understanding the nature and interconnectedness of these processes 2 2 soil sample collection and in situ measurements to guide soil sampling we divided three headwater hillslope catenas at debre mawi into three sections each based on transitions in soil depth informed by a previous study tilahun et al 2014 and soil type as guided by native farmer and field research assistant assefa admasu personal communication may 15 2019 this division was imposed along ridge streamline transects and reflected expected soil depths separating the hillslope crests 2265 2287 m from mid slopes 2240 2271 m and down slopes 2233 2251 m adjacent to the stream channel we took soil samples from 3 locations in each division situating sample locations to span the different aspects presented by the headwater hillslopes east west and south west facing at each location we collected lumped and homogenized soil samples for textural analysis from three depths 0 0 3 m 0 3 0 6 m and 0 6 0 9 m these depths align with agronomic practices and soil structural features previously identified in debre mawi tebebu et al 2015 farmers interviewed stated that they typically cultivate soil to a depth of 0 25 0 3 m prior to the rainy season using a maresha plough abdi and nishikawa 2014 therefore we expected soils in this vertical range to be disturbed and distinct from lower horizons past studies have shown that soils 0 3 0 6 m below the soil surface at debre mawi have high soil penetration resistance 2000 kpa inhibiting root growth and presumably water movement tebebu et al 2015 this compacted soil layer was distinct from deeper soil at depths of 0 6 m which had an intact macrostructure and was less compacted tebebu et al 2017 on the west facing hillslope we also took 9 intact 250 ml cores in the upright position at depths of 0 3 0 6 and 0 9 m in the up slope mid slope and down slope locations we used these samples to develop soil water retention curves for the soil the western hillslope was chosen for the intact sampling as it had the most variable soil textural properties of the 3 aspects additionally we made in situ field measurements of the saturated hydraulic conductivity at 0 3 0 6 and 0 9 m depth at four locations one on the up slope one in the mid slope and two in the down slope sections we used a guelph permeameter to measure the steady state rate of water infiltrating into the soil from a bore hole held at constant head via a marriotte tube reynolds et al 1983 hydraulic conductivity was calculated using the steady state rate of water level change the size of the hole 0 06 m in diameter and the imposed head the accuracy of field measured saturated hydraulic conductivity using guelph permeameter is within a factor of 2 or less metergroup 2012 2 2 1 soil characterization the particle size distribution was measured on the disturbed soil samples using hydrometer and dry wet sieve analyses in the soil mechanics testing lab in bahir dar institute of technology bahir dar ethiopia the analyses followed the astm d422 07 standard astm 2007 based on the analyses we classified soil samples into clay silty clay and silty clay loam we also defined a coarse grained soil class identified as saprolite weathered bedrock developed from volcanic rock for this soil class more than 50 percent of the soil particles could not pass through a 0 075 mm sieve however the large aggregates in these soils which are clearly visible in the field photograph see fig 2 c were not stable and would disintegrate upon wetting or if subjected to mechanical force in the lab the coarse structure was maintained and evident however in the field we developed soil water retention curves wrc for the intact samples taken from the west facing hillslope two instruments were used to develop the wrcs at university of california berkeley the hyprop instrument and the wp4c dew point potential meter the hyprop uses an evaporation method with precision tensiometers schindler 1980 peters and durner 2008 schindler et al 2010b a to measure soil water potential and soil volumetric water content is determined from gravimetric water content the hyprop is optimized for the measurement of wetter soils in which water potentials exceed 0 05 mpa with an accuracy of 5 1 0 6 mpa for 0 01 to 0 05 mpa ums 2015 undisturbed soil cores were used to develop this wet end of the water retention curve as the pore macro structure plays an important role in controlling capillary flow under these conditions campbell and gardner 1971 box and taylor 1962 environment 2017 following the hyprop measurements we took 7 ml disturbed soil from the intact soil samples for use in the wp4c instrument and measurements of the dry end of the water retention curve the saprolite samples were crushed and homogenized before making these measurements the wp4c uses a chilled mirror technique campbell et al 1973 gee et al 1992 to measure soil water potential and the respective soil volumetric water content can be calculated by determining gravimetric water content manually the wp4c has an accuracy of 0 05 mpa for soil water potential range of 0 to 5 mpa and a 1 accuracy for 5 to 300 mpa meter 2015 wp4c soil water potential measurements above 0 3 mpa have associated error greater than 16 the disturbed soil samples used are suitable for water retention curve measurements at these potentials because sampling does not destroy the microstructure of soil aggregates which is primarily responsible for the behavior of the dry end of the water retention curve campbell and gardner 1971 box and taylor 1962 environment 2017 the two instruments overlap in the soil water potentials measured in the range 0 05 to 0 3 mpa however both instruments produce high uncertainty in this range ums 2015 meter 2015 and thus data points within this range were excluded from further analysis the empirical wrcs constructed therefore consist of wet hyprop measurements in the range 0 to 0 05 mpa and dry wp4c measurements in the range 0 3 to 300 mpa the empirical wrcs were fitted to the bimodal van genuchten mualem model across the full water potential range genuchten 1980 durner 1994 fitting this function allows for comparisons with pedotransfer functions vereecken et al 2010 and for parameterization of the soil properties in variably saturated flow models which typically require wrc function parameters as input vereecken et al 2010 guber et al 2006 2009 2 2 2 pedotransfer function performance we selected 13 pedotransfer functions ptfs for evaluation we focused on ptfs that would potentially find application in the ethiopian highlands namely the generic ptf rosetta which is calibrated upon and validated against a global soil database schaap et al 2001 and widely used ptfs specifically derived from tropical soils which predict at least 2 points on the wrc obtained from botula et al 2012 nguyen et al 2015 and patil and singh 2016 one ptf hodnett and tomasella 2002 like rosetta estimates all the parameters of the bimodal van genuchten mualem model allowing a comparison to the full fitted wrcs we refer to rosetta and the hodnett and tomasella 2002 model as continuous ptfs the other 11 ptfs specifically those proposed by aina and periaswamy 1985 lal 1978 arruda et al 1987 oliveira et al 2002 dijkerman 1988 pidgeon 1972 van den berg et al 1997 adhikary et al 2008 gaiser et al 2000 minasny and hartemink 2011 and botula 2013 predict only the water content at field capacity θ 33 k p a and wilting point θ 1500 k p a we refer to these as two point ptfs all the tested ptfs require soil texture and bulk density information additionally some ptfs require additional data such as organic carbon ph and cation exchange capacity as inputs patil and singh 2016 as we did not measure these parameters in our soil samples we used tebebu et al 2017 reported mean values for these variables for the top 0 45 m soil profile in cultivated land in debre mawi watershed in our analysis the continuous ptfs were used to predict the parameters of the bimodal van genuchten mualem model and water content of each measured soil water potential data point for each of the 9 intact soil samples while all ptfs were used to predict the field capacity and wilting point we computed the mean absolute error mae and root mean squared error rmse for each hydraulic parameter across these 9 samples to evaluate the ptf performance the parameters have different ranges and thus we normalized them by the sample mean to allow comparison 2 3 soil profile arrangement modeling scenarios to test the influence of soil layering on rainfall runoff partitioning at hillslope scales we built a synthetic two dimensional unsaturated flow model in hydrus 2d the modeled hillslope section was 30 m long and the soil profile 3 2 m deep with a slope of 9 2 like the debre mawi hillslope profiles the vertical soil profile was specified with 3 regions the surface 0 0 3 m mid layer 0 3 0 6 m and bottom 0 6 3 2 m a no flux boundary condition was imposed at the bottom bedrock boundary and upstream vertical boundary while a seepage face boundary and an atmospheric meteorological boundary condition were specified at the vertical lower boundary and the soil surface respectively as illustrated in fig 3 below a finite element mesh was generated within the three soil layers using a global mesh size of 2 4 m which was refined at the seepage face boundary a potential evaporation time series was estimated using daily maximum temperature this has been previously validated at daily timescales at the nearby adet weather station for the 2003 to 2008 period obtaining r 2 of 0 6 against estimates based on the penman monteith method 0 88 against the hargreaves method and 0 69 against the piche evaporator method enku and melesse 2014 the daily potential evaporation was then prorated at 5 min interval and forced as atmospheric boundary condition along with 5 min rainfall data from the 2012 rainy season we used initial conditions of a dry soil representing the condition at the beginning of kiremt season and corroborated using water table information from hillslopes in debre mawi in a previous study guzman et al 2017 we modeled simple soil profiles based on combinations of the four different soil types we observed in debre mawi watershed clay silty clay silty clay loam and saprolite to constrain the total number of soil permutations we set either the two upper or two lower layers to a single soil type and the remaining layers to a different soil type see table a 6 in the appendix this was the most common profile arrangement observed in the field although more complex profiles do occur although saprolite soil textures were only detected in the mid slope sections in one of the hillslopes with no variation of soil texture in depth in our model we considered the probability of saprolite soils on top of fine textured soils given the high erosion rates in the region overall two dimensional model runs were performed for 28 soil profiles model outputs surface runoff and infiltration into the soil profile were produced on a 5 min time scale while seepage across the bottom boundary of the hillslope was produced on a daily time scale an appropriate scale for the subsurface flow over 111 days representative of the kiremt wet season we plotted these water balance components as a function of rainfall to produce estimates of the production of each flux as a function of rainfall applied we interpreted high ratios of runoff to rainfall in conjunction with low ratios of infiltration to rainfall as indicating that infiltration excess runoff production dominated high ratios of seepage to rainfall indicate conversely that most water is conveyed down slope within the soil we used the model predictions to test two different approaches to estimating runoff behavior based on the soil profile i a rule of thumb heuristic approach and ii a 1d infiltration model with a seepage flow bottom boundary condition intended to mimic the 2d water balance 3 results 3 1 soil texture analysis and soil hydraulic properties summary fig 4 summarizes the soil texture variation within profiles and along the three hillslope transects the soil profile structure varies between the hillslope transects for a given location on the catena and also varies between hillslope locations for a given transect there is no clear pattern that emerges that would enable prediction of the soil horizonation based on aspect or hillslope location alone in most cases the surface soil layer is distinct in texture from the deeper horizons detailed soil textural analysis is presented in table a 5 in appendix fig 5 shows the soil texture and saturated hydraulic conductivity variability on the west facing hillslope where intact soil samples were taken the large variation in conductivity between the clay up slope the weathered saprolite material exposed in the mid slopes and the silty clay down slope area is evident the van genuchten mualem soil water retention curves and parameters developed for all nine samples in hillslope are presented in table 1 the van genuchten mualem model fits the measured data well with low rmse value of 0 02 nrmse of 0 05 and mae of 0 01 thus it can reasonably be used to test the performance of ptfs in debre mawi especially for two point ptfs where we cannot directly compare against measured values as opposed to continuous ptfs table 1 includes also the saturated hydraulic conductivity k s a t obtained from the field measurements the highest value of 0 462 m day was obtained for coarse saprolitic soil and the lowest value of 0 002 m day for the clay soil fig 6 illustrates the data obtained from the hyprop and wp4c instruments and used to fit the curves to a silty clay and saprolite soil sample the continuous measurements at high volumetric water contents θ h are automatic outputs from the hyprop instrument from a single 250 ml intact soil core while the sparser measurements at low volumetric water contents are from manual wp4c readings from two 7 ml disturbed samples re sampled from the 250 ml intact core soil sample such re sampling may result in distinct curves for the dry end of swrc for some soils such as saprolite shown in fig 6 b the gap between continuous hyprop measurements and sparse wp4c measurements stems from the uncertainty associated with both methods in the overlap region as discussed in the previous section the very high volumetric water content in the saprolite soil reflects its high total porosity void space as compared to the silty clay soil 3 2 pedotransfer functions ptf performance predictions of wilting point and field capacity from all ptfs are provided in table 2 rmse errors for the wilting point ranged from 0 07 to 0 17 and rmse errors for field capacity ranged from 0 13 to 0 28 mae for the wilting point ranged from 0 07 to 0 14 and mae for field capacity ranged from 0 09 to 0 22 for all ptfs furthermore prediction of the van genuchten mualem parameters from the two continuous ptfs performed reasonably well with errors ranging from 0 12 to 0 14 rmse for θ s saturated water content 0 25 to 0 32 for n pore size distribution and 0 02 to 0 09 c m 1 for α inverse of air entry pressure see table 3 the rmse between water retention curves produced by the two continuous ptf models and the measured data using all soils data was small 0 16 for both hodnett and tomasella 2002 and rosetta model as shown in table 4 the predictions of the hydraulic conductivity by the continuous model rosetta ptf were reasonably good considering the high intrinsic variability of hydraulic conductivity resulting in 0 33 rmse error 3 3 impact of soil texture profile arrangement in hydrological fluxes all flux outputs from two dimensional model runs of 28 soil profiles are reported as ratios per unit rainfall at a 5 min time scale for runoff and infiltration fluxes while seepage flux is reported at a daily time scale these ratios are shown as a function of the soil profile texture in figs 7 and 8 the dot and whiskers indicate the slope and 95 confidence interval of the regression line between the fluxes and rainfall rate respectively average monthly runoff ratios observed during kiremt season ranged from 0 2 to 0 6 in 2010 and 2011 in a previous study tilahun et al 2014 which are in the same range as our modeled runoff ratios in this study simulations of all soil profile texture arrangements using a 5 min time scale exhibited a mixture of saturation excess and infiltration excess runoff generation mechanisms the soil profile texture arrangements can be grouped into those with high runoff ratio low infiltration fraction and low seepage ratio i e those dominated by surface runoff and those in which runoff ratios are low while infiltration and seepage fluxes dominate as shown in figs 7 and 8 to formalize our analysis we applied k mean clustering algorithm resulting in between total cluster sum of squares of 90 and 89 for infiltration and runoff ratio respectively grouping our 28 soil profile model run outputs into high runoff low infiltration and low runoff high infiltration set see fig 7 these behaviors suggest a heuristic that links the runoff response to the soil texture above and below the 0 3 m profile scenarios where the top 0 3 m profile soil texture is either silty clay or clay almost always produce low infiltration fraction 0 40 to 0 48 regardless of the soil texture below the 0 3 m profile the exception to this rule of thumb were the two profiles with silty clay underlain by saprolite or by silty clay loam on the other hand fluxes in scenarios where the top 0 3 m profile soil texture is either silty clay loam or saprolite are sensitive to the soil texture below the 0 3 m soil profile if the deeper soils are saprolite or silty clay runoff ratios remain low 0 12 to 0 19 and infiltration fractions high 0 8 to 0 88 these profiles also tended to produce the highest seepage ratios particularly if the lowest soil layer 0 6 0 9 m was saprolite or silty clay although seepage ratios were less clearly constrained by soil texture than the other fluxes conversely if the deeper soil layers contain silty clay or clay runoff ratios are higher 0 46 to 0 48 infiltration fractions lower 0 51 to 0 54 and seepage rates are also lower particularly if the lowest soil layer 0 6 0 9 m has a clay or silty clay texture furthermore our simulation results reveal two processes where the hydrological fluxes are controlled by the hydraulic conductivity of the whole soil profile on one hand and another controlled by the surface soil only as shown in fig 9 fig 9 presents runoff and infiltration ratios with respect to the mean of ksat weighted using the distance from the soil surface soil profiles with either clay or silty clay soils on the top 0 3 m profile above well drained soils saprolite and silty clay loam resulted in high runoff ratio regardless of their relatively higher weighted soil profile ksat which we refer to as surface controlled soil profiles on the other hand the remaining all other soil texture profiles can be grouped into profile controlled soil profile where runoff ratio increases with decreasing weighted soil profile ksat overall these findings suggest that the runoff generation mechanism on the debre mawi slopes can be estimated with some confidence based on information about the soil texture in the profile in the case of fine textured top soils surface runoff with limited infiltration is prominent regardless of the underlying soil profile texture on the other hand deeper soil textures dictate infiltration and runoff fluxes for coarse textured top soils in the case of coarse textured deeper soils under coarse textured top soils most rainfall infiltrates and subsurface flows producing seepage fluxes are more significant for removing water from the hillslope 3 4 hydrus 1d vs hydrus 2d comparison by comparison to the heuristic approach to estimating runoff behaviors from the soil texture we found that replacing a 2d model with a 1d model provided an inconsistent estimate of the water balance partitioning on the test hillslopes this is illustrated by plotting the difference between cumulative runoff estimated in the 1d model and the 2d model for all soil profile arrangements in fig a 10 tiles in the figure correspond to the texture in the 0 0 3 m soil layer and the colors relate to two different choices of the seepage face head parameter 2 and 3 m imposed in the 1d model while the 1d model reproduces the cumulative runoff well for some soil profiles in some cases the difference in cumulative runoff was approximately 0 26 m this deviation between models is comparable to the deviation between runoff produced by uniform and variable soil profiles in hydrus 2d the inconsistent ability of the 1d model to represent the water balance partitioning of the 2d hillslope model suggests it is not a reliable approach to interpreting runoff behavior of different soil profiles 4 discussion 4 1 soil texture and hydraulic properties as identified in previous studies the debre mawi watershed is dominated by silty clay to clay soils mekonnen and melesse 2011 the soil texture distribution could not be clearly related to either hillslope position or soil profile see fig 5 although up slope soils were more clayey than mid slope and down slope and saprolite exposures were only identified in the mid slopes during our sample data collection the saturated hydraulic conductivity was approximately two orders of magnitude lower in the lowest conductivity clays than in the most conductive soils namely the mid slope saprolites we had expected to identify a hardpan distinguished by changes in soil texture including higher bulk density lower conductivity and visible changes in the soil appearance at about 0 6 m below the land surface as had been previously identified in the watershed by tebebu et al 2015 however in our samples no clear distinction in soil properties emerged at this depth clay soils generally declined in conductivity by approximately one order of magnitude from 0 0 3 m to the 0 3 0 6 m depth silty clays increased in conductivity between these depth profiles and the saprolites were nearly uniform with depth existing soil datasets in the ethiopian highlands are generally very limited and can highly benefit from additional data collection those collected for the abay basin include data collection of basin scale surface soil texture colot et al 2012 and water shade scale carbon content bulk density and infiltration rates engda et al 2011 bayabil et al 2015 to date measurements of soil hydraulic properties in the ethiopian highlands were limited to two studies one measuring water retention curves in the surface 0 05 m of the soil bayabil et al 2015 and one measuring saturated hydraulic conductivity on disturbed soil samples of varying depths shabtai et al 2014 by measuring soil water retention curves on samples made throughout the vertical soil profile and measuring in situ hydraulic conductivity this study fills gaps left by these previous efforts past studies from anjeni watershed amhara region in northwest ethiopia by bayabil et al 2015 and humera district of northwest tigray region in ethiopia by shabtai et al 2014 have done some soil hydraulic property characterization by developing vgm parameters and measured ksat respectively however these past measurements were collected in different watersheds and despite having soils of similar texture produced very different water retention curves and ksat behavior than what we observed in debre mawi there is a need for future work to address this variability and aid development of ptfs to reduce the burden of data collection by systematically measuring soil hydraulic properties along soil profiles with depth and variation along the hillslope catena in debre mawi the dataset presented here goes some way to filling the knowledge gap about the hydraulic properties of soils in the abay basin 4 2 variable tropical ptfs performance with surface soil textures one of the few soil properties mapped in the ethiopian highlands tools to relate texture to hydraulic properties such as ptfs are particularly valuable evaluation measures for the performance of ptf are dependent on intended application donatelli et al 2004 nevertheless donatelli et al 2004 present 0 02 to 0 11 as typical range of rmse of volumetric water content values from 19 ptfs including some of the ptfs used in this study our evaluation of 13 ptfs fitted against empirically measured data of soil samples showed that the best performing of the two point ptfs for the debre mawi soils was the arruda et al 1987 model with rmse of 0 13 and 0 07 for field capacity and wilting point respectively the worst for field capacity and wilting point were the lal 1978 and aina and periaswamy 1985 with rmse of 0 28 and 0 17 respectively interestingly the best performing ptf at wilting point and field capacity uses silty clay and clay soil textures only which are predominant soil fractions in debre mawi performance evaluation of continuous ptfs using both fitted van genuchten mualem vgm parameters and individual empirical data reveals that both rosetta model and hodnett and tomasella 2002 perform reasonably well overall as shown in tables 3 and 4 comparing each measured soil water potential data for all soil types against ptf predicted values at each data point reveals that rosetta results in low rmse values 0 06 for clay and silty clay soils while it has higher average rmse value of 0 13 and 0 24 for silty clay loam and saprolite soils respectively similarly hodnett and tomasella 2002 results in rmse values 0 09 for clay and silty clay soils 0 16 and 0 22 for silty clay loam and saprolite soils respectively these results support past observations that ptf performance is variable although we constrained our evaluation to ptfs trained on tropical soils some of the ptfs performed worse than others with rmse values above the typical range which asserts the need for more locally validated ptfs depending on the intended application and soil texture present there are several works applying machine learning algorithms to predict soil and hydraulic properties recently araya and ghezzehei 2019 amanabadi et al 2019 kotlar et al 2019 gunarathna et al 2019 veloso et al 2022 given rosetta ptf that is calibrated using a wide variety of soil types from a plethora of global soil databases schaap et al 2001 zhang and schaap 2019 exhibited enhanced performance it seems that either large machine learning driven ptfs or ptfs trained primarily on clayey soils and sensitive to clay fraction are most appropriate for the upper abay basin 4 3 soil profile controls on runoff and erosion soil erosion contributes to spatial variability of soil types and hydraulic properties nikodem et al 2021 variable soil textural and hydraulic properties within a vertical soil profile and along the hillslope catena are characteristic features of the upper abay basin as revealed in our own soil sampling in debre mawi and in previously collected samples from the lake tana basin colot et al 2012 beyene et al 2018 the common practice in the basin similar to the wider ethiopia however is to evaluate soils physical properties based on surface sampling alone as illustrated by the modeling results presented in figs 7 and 8 this extrapolation is risky the modeling results suggest that rather than the surface 0 3 m it is the soil properties at depths of 0 3 0 6 and 0 6 3 2 m that place the greatest control on runoff generation where there are highly conductive surface profile soils this is because on hillslopes with a conductive surface layer underlain by less conductive clays the hillslope may rapidly saturate the upper profile and produce surface runoff saturation excess runoff generation mechanism were found to be the dominant runoff generation mechanism in simulations of soil profile texture arrangements where the soil surface texture is either saprolite or silty clay loam on the other hand where clay soils form the surface profile infiltration excess surface runoff and rill erosion are likely to be inferred as demonstrated in fig 7 regardless of the underlying soils exhibiting a higher hydraulic conductivity than surface soils and increasing the infiltration fraction of the hillslope indeed the models run using homogeneous soil profiles e g those where the surface soils were representative of the entire profile exhibited the most extreme e g highest lowest infiltration and surface runoff production behaviors of all the tested profiles inferring soil hydraulic properties of the profile from surface soil samples alone is likely to bias predictions relative to the behavior of more complex profiles the soil samples we took in debre mawi extended only 0 9 m below the surface the thickest section of the soil profile in our models 0 6 3 2 m was represented by a single soil texture this is likely to amplify the impact of these deep soils on modeled runoff generation it is plausible that the soils below 0 9 m are uniform in texture in the upper slope region however there is evidence for additional soil textural variations in the down slope and there is the potential for the soils to contain saprolite at depth across the entire hillslope catena abiy 2009 in debre mawi the influence of additional soil textural layers and variation on hillslope hydrology in the region remains unclear and will benefit from future characterization and exploration the modeled hillslope water balance was not only sensitive to the vertical arrangement of soil types but also to the 2d flow field we were not able to reliably replicate the runoff behavior of the hillslope in a 1d model the uncertainty associated 1d model runs was comparable to the differences between different soil profile arrangements in the 2d case although 2d variably saturated modeling software is usually proprietary and complex while 1d freeware is widely available and relatively accessible for users to familiarize themselves with these findings suggest that modeling of hillslope hydrology in the ethiopian highlands requires the additional burdens of using a 2d model alternatively a heuristic approach to inferring the dominant runoff behaviors based on the properties of soils profile texture appears to be robust with high surface runoff associated with silty clay or clay soils either in the 0 0 3 m or 0 6 3 2 m soil profile texture and with limited surface runoff and greater seepage fluxes associated with profiles containing silty clay loam or saprolite in the deeper profile regardless however the importance of understanding the soil lithological profile is central our study reveals the necessity of understanding soil profile texture where soil profile controls runoff generation mechanism dominates as opposed to soil surface layer controls runoff generation mechanism this sheds light on the idea of mapping enough by assisting soil profile data collection field campaigns to prioritize based on surface soil textures present in regions with limited resources more importantly quantification of the uncertainty in runoff estimation due to soil profile texture variability in the absence of soil profile data is integral information for decision makers that can be replicated in other regions globally 4 4 implications for catchment management soil and water conservation swc design needs to account for variability in soil profile texture that dictates the runoff generation mechanism in profile controlled soil profiles this would especially help to avoid recommendation of practices that will increase infiltration where we have i high conductive soil such as saprolite or silty clay loam layer on top of less conductive clay soil that can rapidly saturate due to limited storage making the land vulnerable to erosion and ii overall well drained soil profiles that may not need such interventions entirely the soil samples from the mid slope of the west facing hillslope were dominated by the saprolitic soil which appears to be weathered volcanic bedrock this weathered layer represents the breakdown of the underlying parent material its exposure suggests that these mid slope regions have already lost most of the topsoil and subsoils such that the saprolite is now outcropping and forming the surface soil it is intriguing to speculate whether this exposure will be expanded if high erosion rates are maintained in the area the distinct hydraulic properties of the saprolite suggest that its increased exposure could predispose hillslopes towards greater infiltration and subsurface fluxes of water potentially altering the main flow paths and drivers of erosion in the basin the implications of such changes for the longevity and design of soil and water conservation programs merits further consideration 5 conclusion this study demonstrated that global soil dataset or maps produced thereof lack the spatial and temporal resolution needed to capture the effects of profile and hillslope level variation in soil properties and suggest that not only are new measurements needed but that sampling designs through space vertical and along hillslope are needed to capture critical hydrological transport and partitioning processes we present that complex vertical soil profiles and variations in texture along hillslope profiles are exhibited in the debre mawi watershed of the upper abay basin of the ethiopian highlands generating the first depth and hillslope distributed soil water retention curves textural profiles and measures of hydraulic conductivity for the region we have also provided guidance into preferred pedotransfer functions and relationships between the organization of the soil profile and likely runoff generation mechanisms based on the study results the best pedotransfer function performance on the soils was linked to sensitivity to clay fraction the hydrological processes operating on modeled hillslopes containing representative soil profiles were sensitive to the vertical organization of soil texture in particular the composition of the deepest soil layers was the main control on the runoff generation behaviors where we have high conductive surface soil profiles profile controlled soils profiles while the surface soil profiles control the runoff generation behaviors for low conductive surface soil profiles regardless of deeper soil textures surface controlled soil profiles where hydrological processes are not well understood soil sampling efforts should attempt to characterize the vertical structure of the soil profile the results here indicate that this information can be used to infer the likely dominant hydrological processes but that if more precise predictions are needed two dimensional variably saturated flow modeling is needed thus more spatially intensive soil sampling than common current practices of limiting evaluation to the surface soils is needed to understand hillslope hydrology and to recommend appropriate swc practices in this region extending the dataset of soil textures and hydraulic properties to develop more robust ptfs could make this approach to characterization more tractable we realize comprehensive depth distributed soil physical and hydraulic property mapping mapping everything is a challenging endeavor especially in regions where there are limited resources available our study highlights quantification of variations in hydrological fluxes resulting from soil profile texture heterogeneity and uncertainties related to soil hydraulic properties resulting from using common ptfs allows the alternative map enough approach for soil profile properties assessment where data collection is guided based on the process of interest and uncertainty threshold on decision relevant variables credit

mechanisms were sensitive to the vertical organization of soil texture particularly at depths of 30 cm or more below the soil surface for soil profiles that have well drained surface soil textures this suggests that current practices of evaluating soil properties based on surface texture only is insufficient for understanding hillslope hydrology and mitigating soil erosion in these regions in regions where comprehensive soil hydraulic profile data is not available our study quantifies the uncertainties in both ptfs and hydrological fluxes due to variation of soil profile texture present

1 introduction soils are responsible for a multitude of ecosystem services amundson et al 2015 and are particularly important for provisioning of food raw materials and water supply regulation of climate energy nutrient and water cycles and supporting services such as the creation of habitat adhikari and hartemink 2016 yet globally most of the world s soils are degraded and likely to experience further degradation montanarella et al 2016 threatening soils ability to provide these services and the well being of the societies and ecosystems depending on them impacts of soil loss from agriculture include reductions in productivity pimentel et al 1976 bossio et al 2010 fensholt et al 2013 exacerbation of climate change owens 2020 and reduced water security due to loss of water holding capacity in the top soil and sedimentation of river channels and reservoirs falkenmark et al 1989 globally erosion is the greatest threat to soils erosion is closely tied to agricultural practices with the highest rates of soil loss associated with the least developed economies borrelli et al 2017 the burden of soil erosion in the least developed nations is likely to worsen because these nations are most likely to expand croplands global estimates of erosion suggest that the great majority of soil loss is attributable to wind or water processes with water erosion estimated to have caused 35 9 pg yr 1 of soil loss globally in 2012 borrelli et al 2017 water erosion and runoff however can be driven by distinctly different hydrological phenomena saffarpour et al 2016 which may indicate different forms of intervention and prevention where overland flow on dry soils is the major driver of erosion as is typically the case in arid environments mitigation methods must focus on preventing runoff from being formed and slowing and detaining runoff on the landscape rivas 2006 such methods promote the infiltration of water into the soil yet soil saturation can itself drive erosion particularly in humid climates or steep landscapes overland flow produced on saturated soils is often a significant contributor to gully erosion saturated soil conditions reduce the cohesion of particles exacerbating erosion huang et al 2007 and subsurface seepage flows promote head cutting of gullies causing them to migrate up slope wetter conditions homogenize soil preventing heterogeneity in soil moisture from mitigating erosion fitzjohn et al 1998 increasing water inputs infiltration in up slope areas can worsen gully erosion down slope by increasing the risk of saturation adopting treatments that slow detain or infiltrate water near areas prone to saturation is unlikely to be effective in mitigating soil loss instead a range of diversion stabilization and de saturation approaches are needed shilton et al 2015 selecting and designing suitable interventions in landscapes that could produce runoff through multiple pathways requires understanding the hydrological drivers of erosion zimale et al 2017 at the catena scale this understanding depends on having enough information about soil properties to infer the dominant runoff generation mechanisms globally the decades since the year 2000 have seen the production of new high resolution digital soil maps mcbratney et al 2014 adhikari and hartemink 2016 keesstra et al 2016 the high dimensionality and multi scale variability and non stationary nature of many soil properties however continues to pose significant challenges to soil mapping in particular large scale soil maps tend to omit information about the soil profile for example more than half of the available digital soil maps reviewed by chen et al 2022 cover only the surface 0 3 m of soils deeper soil profile information is important for characterizing hydrological behavior rubio et al 1997 šanda et al 2006 beven 1991 in particular the potential for soil saturation on hillslopes deep soil profile information also regulates soil carbon stocks plant water availability and other ecosystem services baveye et al 2016 jonsson et al 2017 kelleway et al 2017 consequently incorporating information about soil characteristics deeper than surface soils in regional mapping remains an important challenge lal 2018 at one extreme of such an approach is a comprehensive depth distributed map of physical and chemical parameters across typically hydrologically or ecologically active soil layers similar to the usgs ssurgo soil product fortner et al 2006 ssurgo however such soil mapping products represent enormous investments in local soil surveying data aggregation and database management an investment which is beyond the capacity of many of the locations where soil data is most urgently needed an alternative approach to mapping everything is to map enough to consider key decisions that will be made with soil datasets and the minimum quantum of information needed to make those decisions with an acceptable level of certainty such approaches have the potential to reduce the burden of data collection needed to inform decision making soil texture and soil hydraulic properties strongly influence which erosion mechanisms are most likely to occur and thus usefully inform the design of erosion control measures runoff response and erosion behavior are sensitive to the characteristics of the surface soil layer the vertical layering of different soil characteristics through the profile mirus and loague 2013 lu and godt 2013 zhang et al 2014 and the organization of this vertical structure changes along the hillslope catena brunner et al 2004 while the trends of soil development thickness and horizonation are sometimes predictable across landscapes and along hillslopes hall and olson 1991 patton et al 2018 this is not always the case in regions where the soil profile saturation controls runoff generation mechanism lack of soil profile texture and hydraulic properties negatively impacts accurate estimation of runoff and the consequent erosion for example erosion in the ethiopian humid highlands is driven by both surface and subsurface runoff processes setegn et al 2009 tilahun et al 2014 practitioners designing soil and water conservation practices in the ethiopian highlands face significant resource constraints meaning that fully characterizing soil profiles vertically and along hillslopes is rarely possible instead erosion risk and the suitability of different soil and water conservation practices are usually evaluated from surface soil texture alone this approach precludes assessment of vertical and hillslope scale variations in soil texture and requires the use of pedotransfer functions ptfs to estimate soil hydraulic properties patil and singh 2016 yet ptf development and testing remains limited in many of the most erosion threatened nations bayabil et al 2019 although site specific validation is recommended when using ptfs patil and singh 2016 bayabil et al 2019 botula et al 2012 to date no such evaluation has been applied in the ethiopian highlands here we attempt to establish what might constitute enough soil profile information to characterize runoff generation mechanisms and inform erosion control approaches using a well studied catchment within the ethiopian humid highlands as a case study region the ethiopian highlands are attractive as a case study due to their severe exposure to soil erosion the limited existing soil profile information in the region and the variability in erosion mechanisms across the landscape in the region high population density steep slope cultivation high rainfall and soil erosion rates with low available resources for soil profile data collection are not unique to the ethiopian highlands consequently inappropriate design of soil and water conservation interventions have hindered adoption of conservation practices in east africa and parts of central america in the past pretty and shah 1997 hellin and ridaura 2016 findings here are thus both locally relevant in the ethiopian highlands for management and also illustrate how soil information can inform soil and water conservation strategies globally we present a characterization of soil textural and hydraulic properties in this data scarce area to reveal heterogeneous vertical structure and variation of the soil profile at different hillslope positions in a 95 ha semi humid watershed in the ethiopian highlands while our data collection is too limited to fully characterize the critical zone soil profile of the study area we use the soil data obtained to i explore the implications of the observed vertical structure of the soils for hydrological and erosion risks ii quantify the risk of mis specifying erosion and hydrological process understanding based on typical practices including evaluating only surface soil textural properties and using ptfs at these sites and iii to suggest some simple rules of thumb for identifying the most likely dominant runoff generation mechanisms based on vertical soil texture profiles for appropriate soil and water conservation practices in the ethiopian humid highlands and similar regions in the world in doing so we aim to fill the knowledge gap regarding what information is most valuable based on the soil characteristics we could reveal for decision making related to runoff and erosion production 2 methods 2 1 study area 2 1 1 the ethiopian highlands the ethiopian highlands experience some of the most dramatic rates of soil erosion in the world estimated mean rates of soil loss vary but are regularly in excess of 10 kg m 2 yr 1 birhanu 2014 sonneveld et al 2011 while measured erosion rates in research watersheds can reach up to 20 kg m 2 yr 1 haregeweyn et al 2017 rapid erosion is driven by high intensity annual rainfall exceeding 2000 mm year viste and sorteberg 2013 where 50 to 80 of it occurs between june and september korecha and barnston 2007 extensive deforestation birhanu 2014 grepperud 1996 abate et al 2017 rainfed cultivation on steep slopes and overgrazing zeleke and hurni 2001 repeated cultivation also leads to loss of soil carbon enhancing the formation of hardpans tebebu et al 2017 by reducing deep infiltration hardpans increase saturation of shallow soils promote overland runoff and erosion tesemma et al 2010 and reduce dry season baseflow enku and melesse 2014 the highlands represent approximately 90 of the arable land in ethiopia house approximately 90 of the population and support 60 of livestock hurni et al 2010 this primarily agrarian economy is exposed and vulnerable to the consequences of soil loss erosion in the ethiopian humid highlands is primarily driven by both surface and subsurface runoff processes setegn et al 2009 tilahun et al 2014 watershed scale analyses indicate that some 17 of a representative watershed area was at risk of significant erosion due to overland flow processes mostly in the uplands while 2 of the same watershed was at high risk of erosion due to saturation of the soil promoting gullying mhiret et al 2019 however readily available tools for predicting erosion risk such as the revised universal soil loss equation rusle are more sensitive to risks of overland flow than gully formation ghosal and bhattacharya 2020 field measurements suggest that gully erosion on saturated soils is the most significant driver of soil loss in the region tebebu et al 2010 zegeye et al 2014 predictability of soil profile characterization is limited in the ethiopian highlands due to its geological and geomorphic history in addition to very few soil landscape studies present the parent materials for the soils of the lake tana basin within the larger abay basin for example were created by the convergence of three grabens chorowicz et al 1998 repeated eruptions of lava produced by shield volcanoes mohr 1983 fluvial erosion of these uplifted basalts filling of the lacustrine plain and river valleys with alluvial sediments and subsequent recession of the lake margins poppe et al 2013 the soils that formed vary from shrink swell clays to red well drained clay loams setegn et al 2010 weathering and erosion of this landscape results in the exposure of different soil layers at different locations on hillslopes producing highly variable vertical profiles for example soil profile measurements in the lake tana basin made by colot et al 2012 and beyene et al 2018 both show considerable variability in soil texture of the same horizon across different study locations 2 1 2 debre mawi watershed the study took place in the debre mawi watershed a 95 ha watershed located in the upper abay blue nile basin of the ethiopian highlands 37 22 e and 11 18 n see fig 1 debre mawi experiences a monsoonal tropical climate with a mean annual temperature of 20 c and 900 mm mean june to october rainfall 2010 2016 which accounts for 80 85 of mean annual rainfall zegeye et al 2016 the watershed is located between elevations of 2195 to 2308 m with maximum slope of 30 dagnew et al 2015 the soil which is underlain by an impermeable layer abiy 2009 varies from 0 58 to 2 96 m in depth in the mid slopes region to 2 8 to 3 92 m depth on the down slopes and 0 95 to 2 28 m depth at the crest guzman et al 2017 tilahun et al 2016 the watershed area is mostly comprised of relatively shallow soils typical of up slope and mid slope locations typically for the region shallow soils are predominantly used for rainfed cropping particularly teff eragrostis tef corn zea mays finger millet eleusine coracana barley triticum sp and wheat triticum aestivum abiy 2009 tilahun 2012 tebebu et al 2010 the down slopes are used for pasture the debre mawi watershed has been the subject of soil water and agricultural research since 2010 runoff in the watershed is mostly produced by saturation excess on poorly drained down slopes tilahun et al 2016 at the beginning of the wet season rill erosion from recently ploughed agricultural land is important but as the wet season progresses and the land saturates active gullies become more important sediment sources tilahun et al 2014 cumulative soil loss due to rill erosion ranges from 1 7 kg m 2 from in the up slope region to 20 kg m 2 from the down slope region tilahun et al 2014 while gully erosion produces between 12 kg m 2 tilahun 2012 and 53 kg m 2 tebebu et al 2010 the long research history of debre mawi combined with its proximity 10 km to a national meteorological station at adet means that valuable ancillary datasets are available to characterize the site including weather hydrometric and sediment concentration mhiret et al 2020 soil physical properties consisting of soil penetration resistance particle size soil organic matter som ph base ions cation exchange capacity cec silica content bulk density moisture content tebebu et al 2017 infiltration rates tilahun et al 2014 and water table levels guzman et al 2017 however soil hydraulic properties such as the saturated hydraulic conductivity and soil water retention curve and their spatial variations along hillslopes and through the soil profile have not been characterized a variety of soil and water conservation practices have been trialed to mitigate erosion in the debre mawi watershed these included both physical structures soil bunds with infiltration ditches stone bunds and stone faced soil bunds and biological intervention planting of trees such as sasbania sasbania grandiflora and elephant grass pennistum purpureum mhiret et al 2020 their impacts have been mixed for instance in the mid slopes the installation of a soil bund increased infiltration and locally reduced runoff and sediment loads a similar installation in the toe slope region however produced a 4 meter wide and 56 meter long gully over a six year period mhiret et al 2020 enhancing infiltration up slope overall may also have contributed to saturation and gully formation in the down slopes gullying in the down slopes increased following installation of soil and water conservation practices in debre mawi herweg and ludi 1999 tilahun et al 2014 zegeye et al 2016 because gullies generate 90 of the sediment loss from the debre mawi watershed the overall rate of soil loss worsened following interventions intended to prevent it tebebu et al 2010 zegeye et al 2018 even though runoff was reduced locally around the installed infrastructure this history illuminates the risks associated with intervening in hillslope scale hydrological processes to reduce erosion risk without fully understanding the nature and interconnectedness of these processes 2 2 soil sample collection and in situ measurements to guide soil sampling we divided three headwater hillslope catenas at debre mawi into three sections each based on transitions in soil depth informed by a previous study tilahun et al 2014 and soil type as guided by native farmer and field research assistant assefa admasu personal communication may 15 2019 this division was imposed along ridge streamline transects and reflected expected soil depths separating the hillslope crests 2265 2287 m from mid slopes 2240 2271 m and down slopes 2233 2251 m adjacent to the stream channel we took soil samples from 3 locations in each division situating sample locations to span the different aspects presented by the headwater hillslopes east west and south west facing at each location we collected lumped and homogenized soil samples for textural analysis from three depths 0 0 3 m 0 3 0 6 m and 0 6 0 9 m these depths align with agronomic practices and soil structural features previously identified in debre mawi tebebu et al 2015 farmers interviewed stated that they typically cultivate soil to a depth of 0 25 0 3 m prior to the rainy season using a maresha plough abdi and nishikawa 2014 therefore we expected soils in this vertical range to be disturbed and distinct from lower horizons past studies have shown that soils 0 3 0 6 m below the soil surface at debre mawi have high soil penetration resistance 2000 kpa inhibiting root growth and presumably water movement tebebu et al 2015 this compacted soil layer was distinct from deeper soil at depths of 0 6 m which had an intact macrostructure and was less compacted tebebu et al 2017 on the west facing hillslope we also took 9 intact 250 ml cores in the upright position at depths of 0 3 0 6 and 0 9 m in the up slope mid slope and down slope locations we used these samples to develop soil water retention curves for the soil the western hillslope was chosen for the intact sampling as it had the most variable soil textural properties of the 3 aspects additionally we made in situ field measurements of the saturated hydraulic conductivity at 0 3 0 6 and 0 9 m depth at four locations one on the up slope one in the mid slope and two in the down slope sections we used a guelph permeameter to measure the steady state rate of water infiltrating into the soil from a bore hole held at constant head via a marriotte tube reynolds et al 1983 hydraulic conductivity was calculated using the steady state rate of water level change the size of the hole 0 06 m in diameter and the imposed head the accuracy of field measured saturated hydraulic conductivity using guelph permeameter is within a factor of 2 or less metergroup 2012 2 2 1 soil characterization the particle size distribution was measured on the disturbed soil samples using hydrometer and dry wet sieve analyses in the soil mechanics testing lab in bahir dar institute of technology bahir dar ethiopia the analyses followed the astm d422 07 standard astm 2007 based on the analyses we classified soil samples into clay silty clay and silty clay loam we also defined a coarse grained soil class identified as saprolite weathered bedrock developed from volcanic rock for this soil class more than 50 percent of the soil particles could not pass through a 0 075 mm sieve however the large aggregates in these soils which are clearly visible in the field photograph see fig 2 c were not stable and would disintegrate upon wetting or if subjected to mechanical force in the lab the coarse structure was maintained and evident however in the field we developed soil water retention curves wrc for the intact samples taken from the west facing hillslope two instruments were used to develop the wrcs at university of california berkeley the hyprop instrument and the wp4c dew point potential meter the hyprop uses an evaporation method with precision tensiometers schindler 1980 peters and durner 2008 schindler et al 2010b a to measure soil water potential and soil volumetric water content is determined from gravimetric water content the hyprop is optimized for the measurement of wetter soils in which water potentials exceed 0 05 mpa with an accuracy of 5 1 0 6 mpa for 0 01 to 0 05 mpa ums 2015 undisturbed soil cores were used to develop this wet end of the water retention curve as the pore macro structure plays an important role in controlling capillary flow under these conditions campbell and gardner 1971 box and taylor 1962 environment 2017 following the hyprop measurements we took 7 ml disturbed soil from the intact soil samples for use in the wp4c instrument and measurements of the dry end of the water retention curve the saprolite samples were crushed and homogenized before making these measurements the wp4c uses a chilled mirror technique campbell et al 1973 gee et al 1992 to measure soil water potential and the respective soil volumetric water content can be calculated by determining gravimetric water content manually the wp4c has an accuracy of 0 05 mpa for soil water potential range of 0 to 5 mpa and a 1 accuracy for 5 to 300 mpa meter 2015 wp4c soil water potential measurements above 0 3 mpa have associated error greater than 16 the disturbed soil samples used are suitable for water retention curve measurements at these potentials because sampling does not destroy the microstructure of soil aggregates which is primarily responsible for the behavior of the dry end of the water retention curve campbell and gardner 1971 box and taylor 1962 environment 2017 the two instruments overlap in the soil water potentials measured in the range 0 05 to 0 3 mpa however both instruments produce high uncertainty in this range ums 2015 meter 2015 and thus data points within this range were excluded from further analysis the empirical wrcs constructed therefore consist of wet hyprop measurements in the range 0 to 0 05 mpa and dry wp4c measurements in the range 0 3 to 300 mpa the empirical wrcs were fitted to the bimodal van genuchten mualem model across the full water potential range genuchten 1980 durner 1994 fitting this function allows for comparisons with pedotransfer functions vereecken et al 2010 and for parameterization of the soil properties in variably saturated flow models which typically require wrc function parameters as input vereecken et al 2010 guber et al 2006 2009 2 2 2 pedotransfer function performance we selected 13 pedotransfer functions ptfs for evaluation we focused on ptfs that would potentially find application in the ethiopian highlands namely the generic ptf rosetta which is calibrated upon and validated against a global soil database schaap et al 2001 and widely used ptfs specifically derived from tropical soils which predict at least 2 points on the wrc obtained from botula et al 2012 nguyen et al 2015 and patil and singh 2016 one ptf hodnett and tomasella 2002 like rosetta estimates all the parameters of the bimodal van genuchten mualem model allowing a comparison to the full fitted wrcs we refer to rosetta and the hodnett and tomasella 2002 model as continuous ptfs the other 11 ptfs specifically those proposed by aina and periaswamy 1985 lal 1978 arruda et al 1987 oliveira et al 2002 dijkerman 1988 pidgeon 1972 van den berg et al 1997 adhikary et al 2008 gaiser et al 2000 minasny and hartemink 2011 and botula 2013 predict only the water content at field capacity θ 33 k p a and wilting point θ 1500 k p a we refer to these as two point ptfs all the tested ptfs require soil texture and bulk density information additionally some ptfs require additional data such as organic carbon ph and cation exchange capacity as inputs patil and singh 2016 as we did not measure these parameters in our soil samples we used tebebu et al 2017 reported mean values for these variables for the top 0 45 m soil profile in cultivated land in debre mawi watershed in our analysis the continuous ptfs were used to predict the parameters of the bimodal van genuchten mualem model and water content of each measured soil water potential data point for each of the 9 intact soil samples while all ptfs were used to predict the field capacity and wilting point we computed the mean absolute error mae and root mean squared error rmse for each hydraulic parameter across these 9 samples to evaluate the ptf performance the parameters have different ranges and thus we normalized them by the sample mean to allow comparison 2 3 soil profile arrangement modeling scenarios to test the influence of soil layering on rainfall runoff partitioning at hillslope scales we built a synthetic two dimensional unsaturated flow model in hydrus 2d the modeled hillslope section was 30 m long and the soil profile 3 2 m deep with a slope of 9 2 like the debre mawi hillslope profiles the vertical soil profile was specified with 3 regions the surface 0 0 3 m mid layer 0 3 0 6 m and bottom 0 6 3 2 m a no flux boundary condition was imposed at the bottom bedrock boundary and upstream vertical boundary while a seepage face boundary and an atmospheric meteorological boundary condition were specified at the vertical lower boundary and the soil surface respectively as illustrated in fig 3 below a finite element mesh was generated within the three soil layers using a global mesh size of 2 4 m which was refined at the seepage face boundary a potential evaporation time series was estimated using daily maximum temperature this has been previously validated at daily timescales at the nearby adet weather station for the 2003 to 2008 period obtaining r 2 of 0 6 against estimates based on the penman monteith method 0 88 against the hargreaves method and 0 69 against the piche evaporator method enku and melesse 2014 the daily potential evaporation was then prorated at 5 min interval and forced as atmospheric boundary condition along with 5 min rainfall data from the 2012 rainy season we used initial conditions of a dry soil representing the condition at the beginning of kiremt season and corroborated using water table information from hillslopes in debre mawi in a previous study guzman et al 2017 we modeled simple soil profiles based on combinations of the four different soil types we observed in debre mawi watershed clay silty clay silty clay loam and saprolite to constrain the total number of soil permutations we set either the two upper or two lower layers to a single soil type and the remaining layers to a different soil type see table a 6 in the appendix this was the most common profile arrangement observed in the field although more complex profiles do occur although saprolite soil textures were only detected in the mid slope sections in one of the hillslopes with no variation of soil texture in depth in our model we considered the probability of saprolite soils on top of fine textured soils given the high erosion rates in the region overall two dimensional model runs were performed for 28 soil profiles model outputs surface runoff and infiltration into the soil profile were produced on a 5 min time scale while seepage across the bottom boundary of the hillslope was produced on a daily time scale an appropriate scale for the subsurface flow over 111 days representative of the kiremt wet season we plotted these water balance components as a function of rainfall to produce estimates of the production of each flux as a function of rainfall applied we interpreted high ratios of runoff to rainfall in conjunction with low ratios of infiltration to rainfall as indicating that infiltration excess runoff production dominated high ratios of seepage to rainfall indicate conversely that most water is conveyed down slope within the soil we used the model predictions to test two different approaches to estimating runoff behavior based on the soil profile i a rule of thumb heuristic approach and ii a 1d infiltration model with a seepage flow bottom boundary condition intended to mimic the 2d water balance 3 results 3 1 soil texture analysis and soil hydraulic properties summary fig 4 summarizes the soil texture variation within profiles and along the three hillslope transects the soil profile structure varies between the hillslope transects for a given location on the catena and also varies between hillslope locations for a given transect there is no clear pattern that emerges that would enable prediction of the soil horizonation based on aspect or hillslope location alone in most cases the surface soil layer is distinct in texture from the deeper horizons detailed soil textural analysis is presented in table a 5 in appendix fig 5 shows the soil texture and saturated hydraulic conductivity variability on the west facing hillslope where intact soil samples were taken the large variation in conductivity between the clay up slope the weathered saprolite material exposed in the mid slopes and the silty clay down slope area is evident the van genuchten mualem soil water retention curves and parameters developed for all nine samples in hillslope are presented in table 1 the van genuchten mualem model fits the measured data well with low rmse value of 0 02 nrmse of 0 05 and mae of 0 01 thus it can reasonably be used to test the performance of ptfs in debre mawi especially for two point ptfs where we cannot directly compare against measured values as opposed to continuous ptfs table 1 includes also the saturated hydraulic conductivity k s a t obtained from the field measurements the highest value of 0 462 m day was obtained for coarse saprolitic soil and the lowest value of 0 002 m day for the clay soil fig 6 illustrates the data obtained from the hyprop and wp4c instruments and used to fit the curves to a silty clay and saprolite soil sample the continuous measurements at high volumetric water contents θ h are automatic outputs from the hyprop instrument from a single 250 ml intact soil core while the sparser measurements at low volumetric water contents are from manual wp4c readings from two 7 ml disturbed samples re sampled from the 250 ml intact core soil sample such re sampling may result in distinct curves for the dry end of swrc for some soils such as saprolite shown in fig 6 b the gap between continuous hyprop measurements and sparse wp4c measurements stems from the uncertainty associated with both methods in the overlap region as discussed in the previous section the very high volumetric water content in the saprolite soil reflects its high total porosity void space as compared to the silty clay soil 3 2 pedotransfer functions ptf performance predictions of wilting point and field capacity from all ptfs are provided in table 2 rmse errors for the wilting point ranged from 0 07 to 0 17 and rmse errors for field capacity ranged from 0 13 to 0 28 mae for the wilting point ranged from 0 07 to 0 14 and mae for field capacity ranged from 0 09 to 0 22 for all ptfs furthermore prediction of the van genuchten mualem parameters from the two continuous ptfs performed reasonably well with errors ranging from 0 12 to 0 14 rmse for θ s saturated water content 0 25 to 0 32 for n pore size distribution and 0 02 to 0 09 c m 1 for α inverse of air entry pressure see table 3 the rmse between water retention curves produced by the two continuous ptf models and the measured data using all soils data was small 0 16 for both hodnett and tomasella 2002 and rosetta model as shown in table 4 the predictions of the hydraulic conductivity by the continuous model rosetta ptf were reasonably good considering the high intrinsic variability of hydraulic conductivity resulting in 0 33 rmse error 3 3 impact of soil texture profile arrangement in hydrological fluxes all flux outputs from two dimensional model runs of 28 soil profiles are reported as ratios per unit rainfall at a 5 min time scale for runoff and infiltration fluxes while seepage flux is reported at a daily time scale these ratios are shown as a function of the soil profile texture in figs 7 and 8 the dot and whiskers indicate the slope and 95 confidence interval of the regression line between the fluxes and rainfall rate respectively average monthly runoff ratios observed during kiremt season ranged from 0 2 to 0 6 in 2010 and 2011 in a previous study tilahun et al 2014 which are in the same range as our modeled runoff ratios in this study simulations of all soil profile texture arrangements using a 5 min time scale exhibited a mixture of saturation excess and infiltration excess runoff generation mechanisms the soil profile texture arrangements can be grouped into those with high runoff ratio low infiltration fraction and low seepage ratio i e those dominated by surface runoff and those in which runoff ratios are low while infiltration and seepage fluxes dominate as shown in figs 7 and 8 to formalize our analysis we applied k mean clustering algorithm resulting in between total cluster sum of squares of 90 and 89 for infiltration and runoff ratio respectively grouping our 28 soil profile model run outputs into high runoff low infiltration and low runoff high infiltration set see fig 7 these behaviors suggest a heuristic that links the runoff response to the soil texture above and below the 0 3 m profile scenarios where the top 0 3 m profile soil texture is either silty clay or clay almost always produce low infiltration fraction 0 40 to 0 48 regardless of the soil texture below the 0 3 m profile the exception to this rule of thumb were the two profiles with silty clay underlain by saprolite or by silty clay loam on the other hand fluxes in scenarios where the top 0 3 m profile soil texture is either silty clay loam or saprolite are sensitive to the soil texture below the 0 3 m soil profile if the deeper soils are saprolite or silty clay runoff ratios remain low 0 12 to 0 19 and infiltration fractions high 0 8 to 0 88 these profiles also tended to produce the highest seepage ratios particularly if the lowest soil layer 0 6 0 9 m was saprolite or silty clay although seepage ratios were less clearly constrained by soil texture than the other fluxes conversely if the deeper soil layers contain silty clay or clay runoff ratios are higher 0 46 to 0 48 infiltration fractions lower 0 51 to 0 54 and seepage rates are also lower particularly if the lowest soil layer 0 6 0 9 m has a clay or silty clay texture furthermore our simulation results reveal two processes where the hydrological fluxes are controlled by the hydraulic conductivity of the whole soil profile on one hand and another controlled by the surface soil only as shown in fig 9 fig 9 presents runoff and infiltration ratios with respect to the mean of ksat weighted using the distance from the soil surface soil profiles with either clay or silty clay soils on the top 0 3 m profile above well drained soils saprolite and silty clay loam resulted in high runoff ratio regardless of their relatively higher weighted soil profile ksat which we refer to as surface controlled soil profiles on the other hand the remaining all other soil texture profiles can be grouped into profile controlled soil profile where runoff ratio increases with decreasing weighted soil profile ksat overall these findings suggest that the runoff generation mechanism on the debre mawi slopes can be estimated with some confidence based on information about the soil texture in the profile in the case of fine textured top soils surface runoff with limited infiltration is prominent regardless of the underlying soil profile texture on the other hand deeper soil textures dictate infiltration and runoff fluxes for coarse textured top soils in the case of coarse textured deeper soils under coarse textured top soils most rainfall infiltrates and subsurface flows producing seepage fluxes are more significant for removing water from the hillslope 3 4 hydrus 1d vs hydrus 2d comparison by comparison to the heuristic approach to estimating runoff behaviors from the soil texture we found that replacing a 2d model with a 1d model provided an inconsistent estimate of the water balance partitioning on the test hillslopes this is illustrated by plotting the difference between cumulative runoff estimated in the 1d model and the 2d model for all soil profile arrangements in fig a 10 tiles in the figure correspond to the texture in the 0 0 3 m soil layer and the colors relate to two different choices of the seepage face head parameter 2 and 3 m imposed in the 1d model while the 1d model reproduces the cumulative runoff well for some soil profiles in some cases the difference in cumulative runoff was approximately 0 26 m this deviation between models is comparable to the deviation between runoff produced by uniform and variable soil profiles in hydrus 2d the inconsistent ability of the 1d model to represent the water balance partitioning of the 2d hillslope model suggests it is not a reliable approach to interpreting runoff behavior of different soil profiles 4 discussion 4 1 soil texture and hydraulic properties as identified in previous studies the debre mawi watershed is dominated by silty clay to clay soils mekonnen and melesse 2011 the soil texture distribution could not be clearly related to either hillslope position or soil profile see fig 5 although up slope soils were more clayey than mid slope and down slope and saprolite exposures were only identified in the mid slopes during our sample data collection the saturated hydraulic conductivity was approximately two orders of magnitude lower in the lowest conductivity clays than in the most conductive soils namely the mid slope saprolites we had expected to identify a hardpan distinguished by changes in soil texture including higher bulk density lower conductivity and visible changes in the soil appearance at about 0 6 m below the land surface as had been previously identified in the watershed by tebebu et al 2015 however in our samples no clear distinction in soil properties emerged at this depth clay soils generally declined in conductivity by approximately one order of magnitude from 0 0 3 m to the 0 3 0 6 m depth silty clays increased in conductivity between these depth profiles and the saprolites were nearly uniform with depth existing soil datasets in the ethiopian highlands are generally very limited and can highly benefit from additional data collection those collected for the abay basin include data collection of basin scale surface soil texture colot et al 2012 and water shade scale carbon content bulk density and infiltration rates engda et al 2011 bayabil et al 2015 to date measurements of soil hydraulic properties in the ethiopian highlands were limited to two studies one measuring water retention curves in the surface 0 05 m of the soil bayabil et al 2015 and one measuring saturated hydraulic conductivity on disturbed soil samples of varying depths shabtai et al 2014 by measuring soil water retention curves on samples made throughout the vertical soil profile and measuring in situ hydraulic conductivity this study fills gaps left by these previous efforts past studies from anjeni watershed amhara region in northwest ethiopia by bayabil et al 2015 and humera district of northwest tigray region in ethiopia by shabtai et al 2014 have done some soil hydraulic property characterization by developing vgm parameters and measured ksat respectively however these past measurements were collected in different watersheds and despite having soils of similar texture produced very different water retention curves and ksat behavior than what we observed in debre mawi there is a need for future work to address this variability and aid development of ptfs to reduce the burden of data collection by systematically measuring soil hydraulic properties along soil profiles with depth and variation along the hillslope catena in debre mawi the dataset presented here goes some way to filling the knowledge gap about the hydraulic properties of soils in the abay basin 4 2 variable tropical ptfs performance with surface soil textures one of the few soil properties mapped in the ethiopian highlands tools to relate texture to hydraulic properties such as ptfs are particularly valuable evaluation measures for the performance of ptf are dependent on intended application donatelli et al 2004 nevertheless donatelli et al 2004 present 0 02 to 0 11 as typical range of rmse of volumetric water content values from 19 ptfs including some of the ptfs used in this study our evaluation of 13 ptfs fitted against empirically measured data of soil samples showed that the best performing of the two point ptfs for the debre mawi soils was the arruda et al 1987 model with rmse of 0 13 and 0 07 for field capacity and wilting point respectively the worst for field capacity and wilting point were the lal 1978 and aina and periaswamy 1985 with rmse of 0 28 and 0 17 respectively interestingly the best performing ptf at wilting point and field capacity uses silty clay and clay soil textures only which are predominant soil fractions in debre mawi performance evaluation of continuous ptfs using both fitted van genuchten mualem vgm parameters and individual empirical data reveals that both rosetta model and hodnett and tomasella 2002 perform reasonably well overall as shown in tables 3 and 4 comparing each measured soil water potential data for all soil types against ptf predicted values at each data point reveals that rosetta results in low rmse values 0 06 for clay and silty clay soils while it has higher average rmse value of 0 13 and 0 24 for silty clay loam and saprolite soils respectively similarly hodnett and tomasella 2002 results in rmse values 0 09 for clay and silty clay soils 0 16 and 0 22 for silty clay loam and saprolite soils respectively these results support past observations that ptf performance is variable although we constrained our evaluation to ptfs trained on tropical soils some of the ptfs performed worse than others with rmse values above the typical range which asserts the need for more locally validated ptfs depending on the intended application and soil texture present there are several works applying machine learning algorithms to predict soil and hydraulic properties recently araya and ghezzehei 2019 amanabadi et al 2019 kotlar et al 2019 gunarathna et al 2019 veloso et al 2022 given rosetta ptf that is calibrated using a wide variety of soil types from a plethora of global soil databases schaap et al 2001 zhang and schaap 2019 exhibited enhanced performance it seems that either large machine learning driven ptfs or ptfs trained primarily on clayey soils and sensitive to clay fraction are most appropriate for the upper abay basin 4 3 soil profile controls on runoff and erosion soil erosion contributes to spatial variability of soil types and hydraulic properties nikodem et al 2021 variable soil textural and hydraulic properties within a vertical soil profile and along the hillslope catena are characteristic features of the upper abay basin as revealed in our own soil sampling in debre mawi and in previously collected samples from the lake tana basin colot et al 2012 beyene et al 2018 the common practice in the basin similar to the wider ethiopia however is to evaluate soils physical properties based on surface sampling alone as illustrated by the modeling results presented in figs 7 and 8 this extrapolation is risky the modeling results suggest that rather than the surface 0 3 m it is the soil properties at depths of 0 3 0 6 and 0 6 3 2 m that place the greatest control on runoff generation where there are highly conductive surface profile soils this is because on hillslopes with a conductive surface layer underlain by less conductive clays the hillslope may rapidly saturate the upper profile and produce surface runoff saturation excess runoff generation mechanism were found to be the dominant runoff generation mechanism in simulations of soil profile texture arrangements where the soil surface texture is either saprolite or silty clay loam on the other hand where clay soils form the surface profile infiltration excess surface runoff and rill erosion are likely to be inferred as demonstrated in fig 7 regardless of the underlying soils exhibiting a higher hydraulic conductivity than surface soils and increasing the infiltration fraction of the hillslope indeed the models run using homogeneous soil profiles e g those where the surface soils were representative of the entire profile exhibited the most extreme e g highest lowest infiltration and surface runoff production behaviors of all the tested profiles inferring soil hydraulic properties of the profile from surface soil samples alone is likely to bias predictions relative to the behavior of more complex profiles the soil samples we took in debre mawi extended only 0 9 m below the surface the thickest section of the soil profile in our models 0 6 3 2 m was represented by a single soil texture this is likely to amplify the impact of these deep soils on modeled runoff generation it is plausible that the soils below 0 9 m are uniform in texture in the upper slope region however there is evidence for additional soil textural variations in the down slope and there is the potential for the soils to contain saprolite at depth across the entire hillslope catena abiy 2009 in debre mawi the influence of additional soil textural layers and variation on hillslope hydrology in the region remains unclear and will benefit from future characterization and exploration the modeled hillslope water balance was not only sensitive to the vertical arrangement of soil types but also to the 2d flow field we were not able to reliably replicate the runoff behavior of the hillslope in a 1d model the uncertainty associated 1d model runs was comparable to the differences between different soil profile arrangements in the 2d case although 2d variably saturated modeling software is usually proprietary and complex while 1d freeware is widely available and relatively accessible for users to familiarize themselves with these findings suggest that modeling of hillslope hydrology in the ethiopian highlands requires the additional burdens of using a 2d model alternatively a heuristic approach to inferring the dominant runoff behaviors based on the properties of soils profile texture appears to be robust with high surface runoff associated with silty clay or clay soils either in the 0 0 3 m or 0 6 3 2 m soil profile texture and with limited surface runoff and greater seepage fluxes associated with profiles containing silty clay loam or saprolite in the deeper profile regardless however the importance of understanding the soil lithological profile is central our study reveals the necessity of understanding soil profile texture where soil profile controls runoff generation mechanism dominates as opposed to soil surface layer controls runoff generation mechanism this sheds light on the idea of mapping enough by assisting soil profile data collection field campaigns to prioritize based on surface soil textures present in regions with limited resources more importantly quantification of the uncertainty in runoff estimation due to soil profile texture variability in the absence of soil profile data is integral information for decision makers that can be replicated in other regions globally 4 4 implications for catchment management soil and water conservation swc design needs to account for variability in soil profile texture that dictates the runoff generation mechanism in profile controlled soil profiles this would especially help to avoid recommendation of practices that will increase infiltration where we have i high conductive soil such as saprolite or silty clay loam layer on top of less conductive clay soil that can rapidly saturate due to limited storage making the land vulnerable to erosion and ii overall well drained soil profiles that may not need such interventions entirely the soil samples from the mid slope of the west facing hillslope were dominated by the saprolitic soil which appears to be weathered volcanic bedrock this weathered layer represents the breakdown of the underlying parent material its exposure suggests that these mid slope regions have already lost most of the topsoil and subsoils such that the saprolite is now outcropping and forming the surface soil it is intriguing to speculate whether this exposure will be expanded if high erosion rates are maintained in the area the distinct hydraulic properties of the saprolite suggest that its increased exposure could predispose hillslopes towards greater infiltration and subsurface fluxes of water potentially altering the main flow paths and drivers of erosion in the basin the implications of such changes for the longevity and design of soil and water conservation programs merits further consideration 5 conclusion this study demonstrated that global soil dataset or maps produced thereof lack the spatial and temporal resolution needed to capture the effects of profile and hillslope level variation in soil properties and suggest that not only are new measurements needed but that sampling designs through space vertical and along hillslope are needed to capture critical hydrological transport and partitioning processes we present that complex vertical soil profiles and variations in texture along hillslope profiles are exhibited in the debre mawi watershed of the upper abay basin of the ethiopian highlands generating the first depth and hillslope distributed soil water retention curves textural profiles and measures of hydraulic conductivity for the region we have also provided guidance into preferred pedotransfer functions and relationships between the organization of the soil profile and likely runoff generation mechanisms based on the study results the best pedotransfer function performance on the soils was linked to sensitivity to clay fraction the hydrological processes operating on modeled hillslopes containing representative soil profiles were sensitive to the vertical organization of soil texture in particular the composition of the deepest soil layers was the main control on the runoff generation behaviors where we have high conductive surface soil profiles profile controlled soils profiles while the surface soil profiles control the runoff generation behaviors for low conductive surface soil profiles regardless of deeper soil textures surface controlled soil profiles where hydrological processes are not well understood soil sampling efforts should attempt to characterize the vertical structure of the soil profile the results here indicate that this information can be used to infer the likely dominant hydrological processes but that if more precise predictions are needed two dimensional variably saturated flow modeling is needed thus more spatially intensive soil sampling than common current practices of limiting evaluation to the surface soils is needed to understand hillslope hydrology and to recommend appropriate swc practices in this region extending the dataset of soil textures and hydraulic properties to develop more robust ptfs could make this approach to characterization more tractable we realize comprehensive depth distributed soil physical and hydraulic property mapping mapping everything is a challenging endeavor especially in regions where there are limited resources available our study highlights quantification of variations in hydrological fluxes resulting from soil profile texture heterogeneity and uncertainties related to soil hydraulic properties resulting from using common ptfs allows the alternative map enough approach for soil profile properties assessment where data collection is guided based on the process of interest and uncertainty threshold on decision relevant variables credit

2302,accurate and efficient streamflow simulations are crucial in arid and semi arid regions for water resources management process based hydrological models generally perform inferior in arid and semi arid catchments data driven machine learning methods show very promising results in terms of prediction accuracy in this study we explore the synergies between process based hydrological model and machine learning model to improve the predictive capability for semi arid basins we developed three hybridization approaches that combine the simulations of the hydrologiska byråns vattenbalansavdelning hbv model with long short term memory lstm neural networks in particular one tight hybridization model is developed to consider the feedback between the lstm model and the hbv model further we investigated the predictive capability of both standalone hbv and lstm models with short length data for training i e one year data in the context of poorly gauged basins the results show distinct improvements in the three types of hybrid models when compared with the hbv model and standalone lstm model in terms of both nse 12 3 25 6 and kge 6 67 9 the model performance of the tight hybridization is the best among all the hybrid models not only in terms of metrics but also hydrological signatures and the simulation of extreme flows when calibrated with short length data records the lstm was more robust than hbv producing acceptable nse and kge values moreover there is a strong correlation 0 92 between lstm model performance and the similarity of flow duration curves fdcs between streamflow series in the calibration and validation periods the results suggest that the hybridization of lstm and hbv may provide an enhanced simulation capacity for semi arid regions besides the lstm model can be successfully calibrated with representative short length data and the characteristics of the representative short length data are found this study provides new insights into the potential use of hybridized machine learning in hydrological simulations keywords hybridization machine learning lstm hbv streamflow simulation calibration data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction the availability of water resources is closely connected to the sustainability of human society and ecosystems makkeasorn et al 2008 shen and chen 2010 however water resources are scarce especially in the arid and semi arid regions as a result of the limited holdings of water resources and the pressure of growing water consumption gunkel et al 2015 wheater et al 2007 climate change would likely contribute to growing aridity greve et al 2019 lian et al 2021 lickley and solomon 2018 ullah et al 2022 reducing renewable surface water and groundwater resources and intensifying the water cycle including its variability and the severity of wet and dry events allan et al 2020 therefore the hydrological regimes particularly in the arid and semi arid regions will likely be affected and thus these areas face the greatest pressure to deliver and manage freshwater resources huang et al 2016 lian et al 2021 besides effective water management prompt response to extreme events like floods is also necessary in arid and semi arid regions since floods are infrequent but extremely damaging wheater et al 2007 streamflow prediction i e rainfall runoff modeling is a long lasting challenge in the field of hydrology which is closely related to water resources management and flood control noori kalin 2016 xiang et al 2020 yaseen et al 2015 however streamflow prediction in arid and semi arid areas is more difficult than in temperate areas due to the high variability of rainfall in space and time soil type land cover and the associated complex hydrological processes jiang et al 2015 ye et al 1997 zoccatelli et al 2020 since accurate streamflow prediction leads to effective water resources management and flood warning gao et al 2020 it is valuable and necessary to enhance the performance of rainfall runoff models over arid and semi arid regions ghaith et al 2020 rainfall runoff models can be generally divided into three categories physically based models conceptual models and data driven models devia et al 2015 different from the physically interpretable models like physically based or conceptual models data driven models can provide limited physical insights due to their black box nature but with the low computational complexity and high model accuracy data driven models have been widely used in streamflow prediction yaseen et al 2015 especially machine learning ml models such as artificial neural networks ann nourani 2017 support vector machine svm lin et al 2013 and fuzzy logic method wang and altunkaynak 2012 owing to the lag effects of hydrological events the majority of hydrological variables e g runoff are time dependent mao et al 2021 as a consequence some types of ml models like feed forward ann may not be suitable for streamflow prediction because the sequential information will be lost during the input data processing kao et al 2020 as an alternative the recurrent neural networks model rnn was designed to process time series data with a structure of internal memory the special architecture of rnn results in a good performance in time series prediction but also leads to the problems of gradient exploding or vanishing for this reason the long short term memory neural network lstm was developed based on the rnn structure to overcome the problem hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 as one popular method of deep learning dl the applications of lstm such as handwriting recognition yeh and chen 2011 speech recognition graves et al 2013 and machine translation sutskever et al 2014 have been surging in the last decade thanks to the development of computer technology le et al 2019 a growing number of studies on lstm have also been done in the fields of hydrology in recent years and it has been perceived as an applicable method of rainfall runoff prediction gao et al 2020 kratzert et al 2018 xiang et al 2020 nevertheless some hydrologists still doubt the feasibility of using ml models for rainfall runoff prediction due to the little connection to the underlying physical processes being modeled beven 2020 elshorbagy et al 2010 see et al 2007 with the exception of the tough work to explain ml models rudin 2019 the integration of physically interpretable models and ml models i e hybridization becomes another plausible idea jiang et al 2020 nourani et al 2014 hybrid models can leverage the strengths of the respective models and have been recently implemented in rainfall runoff prediction currently the commonly used hybridization approach is adding the outputs of physically informed models into ml models the outputs of physically informed models could be simulated streamflow as well as intermediate variables e g soil moisture humphrey et al 2016 okkan et al 2021 similarly konapala et al 2020 and cho kim 2022 used the outputs of physically informed models as inputs of lstm the difference is that they used lstm to simulate the residual between observation and streamflow predicted by physically informed models according to the hybridization approach mentioned above the connections between the physically informed models with ml models are unidirectional and have no feedback kraft et al 2022 proposed a hybrid hydrological model h2m between lstm and a hydrological model the meteorological forcing data static variables and water storage from the hydrological model are used as inputs of lstm then the lstm model yields the five coefficients of the hydrological model for runoff prediction at each timestep considering the differences between the two hybridization approaches we use loose hybridization and tight hybridization to represent the two approaches respectively however a comparison of different hybrid approaches in semi arid climatic conditions is rarely reported generally speaking a majority of rainfall runoff models need calibration to adjust model parameters for satisfactory performance on streamflow simulation arsenault et al 2018 data driven models especially ml models are always considered data demanding gauch et al 2021 hence generally the length of data for model calibration are considered as long as possible arsenault et al 2018 shen et al 2022 therefore this approach is limited in data scarce regions with insufficient data for model calibration nevertheless researchers found that longer calibration data length did not inevitably lead to a better model performance perrin et al 2007 sun et al 2017 and sorooshian et al 1983 suggested using one full hydrological year as the minimum length for the calibration of a conceptual model the study of perrin et al 2007 shows that 350 calibration days sampled out of a longer dataset including dry and wet conditions are sufficient to obtain robust estimates of model parameters for wetter basins as for ml models a few studies have investigated the impact of training data length on model performance and provided suggestions for the minimum length ayzel and heistermann 2021 gauch et al 2021 kratzert et al 2018 but we often lack datasets with that length in data scarce areas for model training according to ayzel heistermann 2021 the robustness of the lstm model is poor when the length of the training data is one year as the length of training data increases the lstm model converges to a maximum average performance level but there are still some models trained with one year datasets that perform similarly to models trained with long datasets which indicates that the short training dataset also has the potential to make the model perform well do we really need longer data for model training or do we just need some very informative data it is therefore valuable to identify short datasets that lead ml models to perform better and to uncover the characteristics of such short datasets despite the growing applications of ml in hydrological modeling there is limited research exploring the capability of ml models with short length e g one year of training data lu et al 2021 tested the lstm model with a short length of training data on some data scarce basins and found that lstm models can reasonably predict daily streamflow with high nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient when hydrologic variability in the prediction period is similar to the training period unfortunately there is little research on quantitative analysis of the characteristics of promising short datasets thus we hypothesize that a ml model trained with representative one year data is also able to achieve a satisfactory performance e g nse greater than 0 5 representative one year data means that it includes diverse flow conditions reflecting the various phenomena experienced by the catchment given that the questions we are asking in this study are as follows 1 whether hybrid models could enhance model performance when compared to the standalone ml model or process based conceptual model and to what extent the enhancement is if the answer is positive 2 what characteristics of the training data contribute to good model performance when only a short training dataset i e one year data is available 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the weihe river located in central china with a total length of 818 km is the biggest tributary of the yellow river the area of the weihe river basin wrb is around 134 800 km2 guo et al 2017 it is enclosed by the chinese loess plateau and loess is widely distributed in the basin the overall terrain of the wrb is inclined towards the east fig 1 climatologically the wrb is located in a continental monsoon climate zone with semi arid characteristics the annual average temperature is about 12 14 while the mean annual precipitation is around 610 mm which mainly occurs between june and october there has been a continuing decrease in water resources of the wrb in recent years due to the decrease in inflow and the increase in water usage according to the water resources bulletin of shaanxi gansu province and the ningxia hui autonomous region in china the water usage in the wrb reached 6 5 billion m3 in 2018 while the total water resources were 9 5 billion m3 which indicated a severe problem of water shortage in the wrb in this study we focused on the streamflow generation of the main stream of weihe river and the tributary jinghe river the huaxian hydrological station was located in the lower stream of the wrb just upstream the confluence of the luohe river and the weihe river fig 1 the catchment area upstream huaxian station is 104 453 km2 accounting for 77 of the total area of the wrb 2 2 data daily temperature precipitation and potential evapotranspiration were used as basic forcing data in this study specifically hourly temperature data are from the era5 land reanalysis dataset including maximum and minimum temperature therefore daily maximum and minimum temperatures were calculated using hourly data based on the hargreaves formula hargreaves and samani 1985 potential evapotranspiration pet was calculated the multi source weighted ensemble precipitation mswep v2 8 product beck et al 2019 was used as forcing mswep v2 8 features new data sources improved weight maps and less peaky precipitation estimates and covers a longer record spanning from 1979 to 2020 daily streamflow at the huaxian station was provided by the yellow river conservancy committee spanning a period of nearly 14 years 2006 to 2020 3 methodology in this study two experiments were conducted to examine the questions posed above in the first experiment three types of hybridization approaches were proposed for streamflow simulation the performance of the three hybrid models was evaluated and compared with the standalone lstm and hbv models in the second experiment calibration data were split into subsets of one year length we calibrated and trained the standalone hbv model and lstm model with one year subsets and evaluated the two models for the whole validation period and the performance of the two models on each year in the validation period was also tested to explore the underlying relationship between the data in calibration and validation periods 3 1 hbv model the hydrologiska byråns vattenbalansavdelning hbv model is a semi distributed conceptual hydrological model originally developed by sweden meteorology and hydrology institute smhi bergström 1976 the structure of the hbv model can be generally divided into four parts i e snow routine soil routine response routine and routing routine in the snow routine precipitation accumulates as snow if the temperature is below the threshold temperature tt and melt of snow starts and meltwater is calculated with a simple degree day method if the temperature is above tt in the soil routine the recharge to the upper groundwater box and the actual evapotranspiration are calculated based on the ratio between the current water content of the soil box and its maximum value in the response routine the outflows of the upper and lower groundwater boxes are calculated through a simple linear reservoir method in the routing routine the generated runoff of one timestep is distributed on the following time steps based on an equilateral triangular weighting function due to the simple but robust model structure and the good adaptivity in the semi arid region li et al 2009 masih et al 2010 the hbv model was used as the benchmark model as well as the input of hybrid ml models in this study in addition the application of the hbv model on rainfall runoff prediction was based on the hbv light software seibert and vis 2012 which requires daily precipitation air temperature and potential evapotranspiration data as model inputs 3 2 lstm model lstm neural network first proposed by hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 is a special type of recurrent neural network rnn and has been widely used in classifying processing and predicting based on time series data the lstm architecture gets better performance in long term memory than rnn and overcomes the gradient exploding and vanishing weakness of rnn as a result of the replacement of the traditional rnn unit with a memory block a common lstm unit is composed of a cell an input gate an output gate and a forget gate the lstm model structure is described by the following equations 1 f t σ w f h t 1 x t b f 2 i t σ w i h t 1 x t b i 3 c t tanh w c h t 1 x t b c 4 c t f t c t 1 i t c t 5 o t σ w o h t 1 x t b o 6 h t o t t a n h c t where x t is the input vector to the lstm unit f t is the forget gate s activation vector i t is the input gate s activation vector o t is the output gate s activation vector h t is the hidden state vector also known as the output vector of the lstm unit c t is the cell input activation vector c t is the cell state vector w and b are weight matrices and bias vector parameters which need to be updated during training 3 3 hybrid model in this study three types of hybrid models that integrate the outputs of the hbv model into lstm were proposed for streamflow prediction the difference between the three types of hybrid models is that the first two models are in loose hybridization while the third model is in tight hybridization in this study hybrid1 hybrid2 and hybrid3 are used to denote the three hybridization approaches respectively as shown in fig 2 a the outputs of the hbv model are used as inputs of the ltsm model to simulate streamflow or the streamflow residual i e hbv simulated streamflow minus observed streamflow in the hybrid1 and hybrid2 approaches in the hybrid3 approach the inputs of the lstm model are the same as the hybrid1 and hybrid2 approaches while the outputs of the lstm models include two parts simulated streamflow as well as parameters of the hbv model the parameter set is transmitted to the hbv model subsequently and a feedback structure is formed the hybridization processes of the hybrid3 approach at each timestep are depicted in detail in fig 2b 3 4 experimental design as mentioned above two experiments were carried out in this study the first experiment aims to investigate the enhancement of hybrid models to the standalone ml and conceptual model and the second experiment aims to explore the feasibility of training the ml model with one year data for streamflow simulation for both experiments we built the hbv model based on the hbv light software and run the monte carlo simulation 100 000 times then selected 100 parameter sets with the best model performance in terms of the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse for all the ml models including the standalone lstm and hybrid models we trained 100 times and saved the models when nse values exceed 0 5 in the training period as an ensemble all models were built based on a one layer structure with 20 nodes using the keras library in python 3 9 we trained the models with a batch size of 10 using a stochastic gradient descent optimization algorithm called adam and mean square error mse as the loss function for the hybrid3 approach we used a weighted mse for training based on observed streamflow and simulated streamflow from both the hbv model and lstm model the ratio of mse of the two models is tested from 0 2 0 8 to 0 5 0 5 and finally set as 0 2 0 8 the input sequence length was set as 60 and the initial learning rate was set as 0 001 referring to the setup in lu et al 2021 all the model inputs were standardized within the range of 0 to 1 and all the negative values are set to zero before model evaluation 3 4 1 experiment 1 enhancement of hybrid models five models were built and calibrated trained i e the hbv model the standalone lstm model and three hybrid models in this study the hbv model and standalone lstm model were set as benchmark models all models were trained and calibrated with long continuous data set i e from 2006 to 2015 and tested and validated over the period from 2016 to 2020 the inputs of the hbv model and lstm model are the same i e the basic meteorological data as for the three hybrid models the inputs include the basic meteorological data as well as the output of the hbv model see table 1 for details of input output and calibration training hereafter we do not differentiate the two terms target for each model table 1 3 4 2 experiment 2 feasibility of model training with one year data in the second experiment we intended to explore the feasibility of using a short length of data to train ml models therefore we split the original calibration data series into 9 subsets with a one year length then each subset was used to calibrate and train the hbv and standalone lstm models the performance of the two models was tested on the same validation period as in experiment 1 i e 2016 2020 as well as each year in the validation period 3 5 evaluation criteria in this study the evaluation and comparison of model performance are not only based on the metrics of hydrograph similarity but also on the hydrological signatures to explore hydrological processes simulated by different models regarding the metrics of hydrograph similarity we use nse and kge to quantify the general model performance and the three decompositions of kge to evaluate the model performance from different aspects six hydrological signatures are used to characterize a wide variety of hydrological features such as the baseflow contribution flashiness of flood etc the details of metrics and signatures are shown in table 2 moreover the flow duration curve fdc is also used to characterize the streamflow in order to quantitively compare the similarity of fdcs between the calibration period and validation period we employed the metric r fdc which was proposed by westerberg et al 2011 for model calibration purposes as illustrated in fig 3 the area under the fdc is divided into a certain number n of equal discharge volume bins resulting in n 1 equally spaced evaluation points ep for each ep a perfect fit gets a score s of 0 while values at the lower limit and upper limit get a score of 1 and 1 respectively those values within or outside the limits are linearly inter or extrapolated the metric r fdc is thus calculated as 7 r fdc 1 i 1 n 1 s i n 1 therefore a simulation with a perfect fit to the crisp discharge i e discharge at evaluation points in the fdc at all eps received a r fdc value of 1 and if the simulated discharge is at either limit for all eps this resulted in a r fdc value of 0 in this study 20 equal bins are used i e n 20 and the upper and lower limits are set as 10 of observed discharge at each ep 4 results 4 1 overall model performance as described in section 3 4 we trained the hbv model standalone lstm model and three hybrid models and saved models when nse exceeds 0 5 in the training period as ensembles as a result all 100 runs of standalone lstm hybrid1 and hybrid2 models satisfied the criterion while only 69 runs of the hybrid3 model met thus we calculated the metrics during the validation period using the median streamflow values of each ensemble as shown in table 3 as shown in table 3 the nse values of the median output of the hbv model and the standalone lstm model are similar and the nse value of the standalone lstm model is slightly higher than that of the hbv model however the kge value of the hbv model is much higher than that of the standalone lstm model through the comparison of the three decompositions of kge it is found that the correlation coefficients r of the hbv and lstm are close but the α and β values of the hbv model are greater than 1 indicating that the standard deviation and mean value of the hbv simulated streamflow are higher than the observed streamflow while that of the standalone lstm model is just the opposite however the degree of deviation of the hbv model in α and β values is less than that of the lstm model on the other hand the nse value and the kge value of the hybrid3 model are the best among the five models and the hybrid1 model follows the kge values of the hybrid3 and hybrid1 models increase by 68 and 64 referring to the standalone lstm model the α value of the hybrid2 model is the closest to 1 indicating that the variance of the simulated streamflow of the hybrid2 model is the closest to that of the observed streamflow the β value of the hybrid3 model is the closest to 1 indicating that the mean value of the simulated streamflow of the hybrid3 model is the closest to that of the observed streamflow we also plot the boxplot of metrics using the ensemble of each model as shown in fig 4 the box lengths of all five metrics of the hbv model are the longest indicating that the uncertainty of the hbv model is higher than that of other ml models in other words the model performance of ml models is more stable nevertheless from table 3 and fig 4 we can see that the r values of the hbv model and the lstm model are quite similar thus the underlying cause for the enhancement of the hybrid models might be the improvement in α and β it is obvious that the α and β values of the lstm model are lower than 1 indicating the variability and mean of the streamflow simulated by the lstm model are underestimated on the contrary the α and β values of the hbv model are higher than 1 but they are closer to 1 than those of the lstm model thus the integration of the hbv model and the lstm model resulted in the balance of the α values and the α values of the two hybrid models are closer to 1 than those of both the hbv model and lstm model but the β values of the three hybrid models seem to be influenced by the hbv model and are greater than 1 as the hbv model 4 2 performance of signatures in order to make a more detailed analysis of the simulation results of each model we draw the violin plot of each signature using the ensemble results of each model fig 5 overall hbv has a much more elongated distribution for most signatures indicating that the simulated flows spread prominently on the contrary hybrid1 shows a distinct peak on the kernel density curve for all signatures indicating very stable simulations during the validation period the base flow index bfi is a signature that depicts the importance of the baseflow process and a high bfi value indicates high residence time from fig 5a we can see that most of the lstm hybrid2 and the hybrid3 models can reproduce the bfi indicating a strong skill to capture the slow groundwater processes in contrast the hbv models and the hybrid1 models slightly overestimated the bfi value indicating that the slow flow process is not well represented the runoff ratio rr is the fraction of precipitation that becomes runoff and can be calculated at different scales a low total runoff ratio total rr at a multiannual scale means high overall water loss to deep groundwater and low event runoff ratio event rr means more drainage and large storage mcmillan 2020 fig 5b and fig 5c show that the hybrid3 and hybrid1 models resulted in the closest rr to the level of observed streamflow series at the total and event scale respectively on the contrary the lstm models significantly underestimated rr indicating the water balance may be not conserved or most rainwater is retained in the soil this is consistent with the low α and β values in the previous section the value of event rr 0 041 is just half of that 0 086 for total rr red dash lines in fig 5 which demonstrates the importance of slow runoff processes as a significant proportion of rainfall reaches the stream outside the event window somehow the ratios of total rr over event rr are not well captured by all but the hybrid3 model half flow date hfd is the date on which the cumulative discharge since the beginning of the water year october 1 september 31 exceeds half of the total annual discharge hfd is a regime signature and a later hfd corresponds to higher elevation and more snow dominated regimes addor et al 2014 from fig 5d we can see that a few hbv models and hybrid2 models as well as some hybrid3 models see the ends of the violins can reproduce the hfd but most of the hbv models seem to overestimate the hfd value while all the hybrid models seem to underestimate fig 5d indicates that the hbv models result in slightly more snow dominated regimes than the observed streamflow series while the ml models result in less snow dominated i e more precipitation dominated regimes and the degrees of underestimation of the lstm hybrid1 hybrid2 and hybrid3 models descend successively fdc slope is the slope of a flow duration curve between two normalized streamflow percentiles in this study the percentiles we chose for the calculation of fdc slope are 33rd and 66th which correspond to the midsegment of fdc a steep fdc slope leads to small soil capacity and higher overland flow while a flatter slope indicates a more sustained groundwater response yilmaz et al 2008 from fig 5e we can see some hbv and hybrid3 models can reproduce the fdc slope and more hbv and hybrid3 models result in steeper fdc slopes than the observation indicating the hbv and hybrid3 model simulations present small soil capacity and higher overland flow and the other three ml models are on the contrary rising limb density rld is the ratio between the number of peaks and the total duration of the rising limbs of the hydrograph rld is a signature that reflects the shape and smoothness of a hydrograph and indicates the flashiness of the catchment response from the aspects of hydrological processes sawicz et al 2011 high rld shows that routing and delay processes dominate over hillslope processes shamir et al 2005 fig 5f shows that only some hybrid3 models can reproduce the rld and the other four models underestimate the rld indicating that the hybrid3 model tends to overestimate the domination of routing processes over hillslope processes while the other four models are on the contrary 4 3 performance of extreme flow simulations fig 6 shows the flow duration curves fdcs of the observed streamflow and simulated streamflow for each model it is obvious that marked differences in high flow simulation exist among different model groups fig 6 a the hbv model and the hybrid2 model overestimate the high flows while the standalone lstm model underestimates them the fdc of the hybrid1 and hybrid3 models simulated streamflow coincides with that of the observed streamflow in the extremely high flow section which indicates that the hybrid1 and hybrid3 models appear to have lower errors in high flows this may explain the best nse and kge values achieved shown in table 3 moreover we can see that hybrid1 hybrid2 and the standalone lstm model tend to overestimate the low flows while the hybrid3 and hbv models tend to underestimate but the errors of all model simulations in low flows are less than 50 m3 s which are trivial when compared to those in high flows hydrographs of different models in two typical hydrological years are plotted in fig 7 the left column of fig 7 clearly shows that the hbv model fails to capture the flow dynamics before september 2016 while the other four ml models perform slightly better however all five models overestimate the streamflow in september and october of 2016 it seems that all models are influenced by the high and intensive precipitation which might be incorrectly recorded on the other hand there is a distinguishing difference in the peak flow simulation shown in the right column of fig 7 the hbv model and the hybrid2 model overestimate the peak flow in august while the lstm seems to underestimate it the simulated peak flows of hybrid1 and hybrid3 in august are very close to the observation but the hybrid models overestimate the streamflow between september and october 2020 which is similar to the simulations of the hbv model 4 4 model performance with one year data training accounting for the uncertainty of model parameters the hbv model and the standalone lstm model were calibrated with one year data from 2007 to 2015 respectively and each setup was calibrated 100 times resulting in an ensemble of 100 models the median simulations of ensembles from the hbv model and standalone lstm model were used for model performance evaluation as shown in fig 8 we can see the striking difference in nse and kge for different evaluation periods using various one year data for model calibration in terms of nse we can see that the minimum nse value of the lstm model achieved during the full validation period is 0 392 and the mean nse value is 0 508 while the minimum and mean nse values of the hbv model are 1 261 and 0 222 respectively similarly the lstm outperformed hbv in terms of the kge minimum mean median kge of the lstm and hbv models are 0 325 0 514 0 510 and 0 337 0 445 0 449 over the full validation period recall that the nse and kge of lstm and hbv trained with full calibration data 2006 2015 are 0 602 and 0 593 and 0 474 and 0 719 during the full validation period respectively table 3 these results clearly show the advantage of lstm over hbv using one year data for model training nevertheless the performance varies with training data from fig 8 we can see that one year data from 2007 2013 and 2014 are able to calibrate hbv to achieve better nse and kge during the full validation period similar but differently one year data from 2007 2010 2012 and 2013 are able to train lstm to achieve better results however the superiority of lstm over hbv may be subverted if one looks at the performance metrics of a certain validation year instead of the full validation period it is the case for the year 2017 a dry year in which the hbv performs overwhelmingly better than lstm either in terms of nse or kge similarly if data from a certain year is used for model training the superiority may also vary for instance hbv performs slightly better in terms of both metrics using data from 2014 for model training nevertheless both models fail to properly reproduce streamflow in the year 2016 which is an extremely dry year as shown in fig 7 as well as in fig a1 fig 9 displays q q plots for all five evaluation years lstm significantly overestimates streamflow in the year 2016 no matter which year the model was trained with similarly the hbv model significantly overestimates streamflow in the year 2020 for all calibration cases since the years 2016 and 2020 are the representative dry and wet years respectively there is a tendency of the hbv model to overestimate the peak flow and underestimate the low flows while the lstm model is on the contrary for the other three validation years i e 2017 2019 two models perform quite similarly nevertheless models trained with one year data of a certain year indeed show various performances on different validation periods however fig 8 and fig 9 also show that models trained for some years e g 2013 and 2014 show strong predictive skills in all validation years 5 discussions 5 1 the superior performance of the hybrid models as reported in section 4 1 a remarkable model performance enhancement of the hybrid models over the standalone lstm and hbv models is revealed the hybrid models are shown to outperform the standalone lstm and hbv in terms of the accuracy of the median simulations as well as reliability and resolution of the prediction distributions moreover hybrid models show high skills to simulate high flows that are significantly underestimated by standalone lstm and overestimated by hbv in addition hybrid models can reproduce the hydrological signatures better than the standalone lstm model indicating the value of integration of hbv model output although hybrid models generally outperform the standalone lstm and hbv models the hybridization approaches do show different performances specifically the hybrid1 model slightly outperforms the hybrid2 model in terms of both nse and kge the signatures of the two model simulations also differ these results are in line with a previous study konapala et al 2020 where the performance of hybrid2 model in general was just slightly better than lstm and conceptual model but very uniform across most catchments studied the performance of the hybrid3 model is the best among all hybrid models which is represented in terms of metrics evaluation hydrological signature reproduction and high low flow simulation the results demonstrate that the tight hybridization approach is more efficient than loose hybridization in streamflow simulation the substance of the hybrid3 approach is the hbv model with time varying parameters which are provided by the lstm neural network the advantage of the hybrid3 approach over the other two hybrid approaches is that it does not have a black box core and can provide physical insights by producing interpretable variables e g soil moisture nevertheless the hybrid3 model in this study still has some shortcomings the hybrid1 and hybrid2 models have close computational efficiency to the standalone lstm model however the training process of the hybrid3 model is more time consuming than the other three ml models and the hybrid3 model is the only model which suffers from non convergency only 69 runs satisfied the condition that nse should exceed 0 5 in the training period the reason for the low robustness and high computational cost of the hybrid3 model might be that the 11 hbv parameters are too many for model training which deserves further investigation in the future the hybrid1 and hybrid3 models are recommended for practical application since they outperform other models the choice of hybrid1 or hybrid3 models depends on whether the practical application scenario focuses on computational efficiency or model accuracy knowing that the integration of the hbv model outputs can improve the performance of standalone lstm we face questions about whether and how the accuracy of the hbv model impacts the performance of hybrid models we tested the hybrid1 model with streamflow of different levels of uncertainty specifically the hybrid1 model was run with observed streamflow series instead of hbv simulated streamflow and set as the benchmark gradually the streamflow input of hybrid1 models was disturbed by additive gaussian noises of 1 8 standard deviations all the hybrid models mentioned above were trained up to 200 epochs with the same hyperparameters introduced in section 3 4 the trained model at each epoch was tested in terms of nse during the full validation period i e 2016 2020 fig 10 shows the curves of dynamic nse values in the full validation period it is obvious that the nse value reached convergence rapidly and remained at approximately 1 stably when the observed streamflow series was used while for the cases that observed streamflow was disturbed with one and two σ there was a distinct decrease in both the convergence rates and the convergence values of nse however if the uncertainty of the observed streamflow series is very large i e noises with 8 σ the reduction in the convergence rates and the convergence values of nse gradually became smaller and the final convergence values of nse were around 0 6 which is close to the performance of the standalone lstm model black dashed line in fig 10 therefore the performance of hybrid models will do better if the outputs of the hbv model become more accurate and vice versa however there exists a bottom line where the performance of hybrid models will not reach below and the performance at the bottom line corresponds to the performance of the standalone lstm model 5 2 the feasibility of model calibration using one year data from fig 8 we can see the average performance of the lstm model on the full validation period is better than the hbv model indicating that the lstm model is more robust than the hbv model when using one year data for model calibration this finding is different from the research by ayzel and heistermann 2021 they tested the hourly runoff simulations by the conceptual gr4h model the lstm model and the gru model in six camels basins they found that the gr4h models are more robust and perform better compared with the two ml models using one year data for calibration the difference in findings might come from the model structure difference between hbv and gr4h which has only four parameters on the other hand both studies are case studies and the similarity of flows between the calibration and validation data sets might be another reason to look into the question of why some years are capable to constrain the models to reproduce streamflow well the flow duration curve fdc of the nine individual years was plotted against that of the full validation period fig 11 intuitively the fdcs of years 2008 2009 and 2015 are the most different compared to the fdc of streamflow in 2016 2020 all three years are very dry and the maximums are no more than 35 of the maximum of 2016 2020 this indicates that data from a dry period are not very informative and may explain the poor performance of hbv and lstm shown in fig 8 this is in line with previous studies with process based models brigode et al 2015 seibert and beven 2009 sun et al 2017 on the contrary the fdc of the year 2011 is also very different but in another way although the year 2011 is very wet models calibrated with such data are not skillful during the full validation period a careful check shows that an extremely large flash flood event occurred of which the generation mechanism is probably different from others this indicates that the extreme flood event is disinformative for the model calibration beven and westerberg 2011 however models calibrated with one year data from a certain year show different skills when the evaluation is conducted in another year fig 8 to quantify the similarity of fdcs between streamflow series the r fdc between a single year in the calibration period and a single year in the validation period were calculated and shown in fig 12 furthermore we calculated the pearson correlation coefficient between performance metrics in fig 8 with the r fdc in fig 12 it is distinct that there is a strong correlation 0 918 and 0 920 between the r fdc and the model performance metrics i e nse and kge for the lstm model this is the more similar the streamflow between calibration and validation periods the better the lstm model performs during validation periods which is consistent with the results of lu et al 2021 however the correlation coefficients between the r fdc and nse as well as kge for the hbv model are low 0 238 and 0 161 indicating the similarity of streamflow in the frequency domain may not be enough to explain model performance interestingly the lstm performs reasonably well in the extreme wet year 2020 using one year data from 2011 or 2012 but the hbv model fails using either one several studies pool et al 2017 seibert and beven 2009 indicated that high maximum data contained more information although both years are also very wet the flood events are different as shown in fig a1 this may indicate that the runoff generation process is different between 2011 and 2020 and hbv and lstm use the calibration data differently however delving into the issue needs further research which is beyond this study 6 summary and conclusions this work aimed at enhancing streamflow simulation by incorporating process based hydrological model outputs into the ml model and further exploring the feasibility of short length data for ml model calibration to this end two experiments were carried out in the first experiment three types of hybrid models were built based on a conceptual model hbv and a machine learning model lstm with the standalone hbv and lstm models as benchmarks in the second experiment calibration data was split into subsets of one year length and then the performance of the standalone hbv model and lstm model calibrated with such data was tested in addition the performance of the two models on each year in the validation period was also examined to explore the underlying mechanism of model performance based on the results of the two experiments the main conclusions are drawn as follow 1 overall there are distinct improvements in the three types of hybrid models when compared to the hbv model and the standalone lstm model in both nse 12 3 25 6 and kge 6 67 9 the hybrid3 model outperforms the hybrid1 and the hybrid2 indicating that a tight hybridization approach is more efficient than loose hybridization in streamflow simulation however the hybrid1 is more skillful than the hybrid2 indicating that the nonlinear relationship between inputs and streamflow outputs instead of residual is well captured nevertheless all ml based models show greater stability and robustness than the hbv model in reproducing streamflow and signatures 2 in terms of model performance on low and high flows the hbv model and hybrid2 model tend to overestimate high flows while the lstm model tends to underestimate them comparatively simulations of the hybrid1 and hybrid3 models show high consistency with the observed streamflow especially the extreme floods the hbv model tends to underestimate the streamflow in the low flow section while the other three models are on the contrary 3 when using only one year data for calibration on average the performances of the standalone hbv and lstm in the full validation period are similar to the benchmark i e nine year data for calibration however the performance varies with the calibration year the lstm model shows higher stability when compared to the hbv model in the full validation period moreover there is a strong correlation between lstm model performance and the similarity between streamflow series in calibration and validation period while it is not found for the hbv model the generally superior performance of the hybrid models when compared with the hbv and lstm models has demonstrated the potential of hybridization approaches to improve prediction accuracy in semi arid basins although the results presented in this work are case study focused and may not be generalized the methods can be easily applied to other regions and may be of particular interest for arid or semi arid basins where the hydrological regime is extreme and highly variable one year data for model calibration is workable especially for ml models in data scare regions however more tests are needed to reach an undeniable conclusion some questions are still open 1 if a combination of two one year data one extremely dry and another extremely wet for model calibration could achieve better performance and 2 how to find such combinations if the answer is positive future studies may further investigate the capability of ml models with short lengths of data for calibration using large sample hydrological data sets such as the catchment attributes and meteorology for large sample

2302,accurate and efficient streamflow simulations are crucial in arid and semi arid regions for water resources management process based hydrological models generally perform inferior in arid and semi arid catchments data driven machine learning methods show very promising results in terms of prediction accuracy in this study we explore the synergies between process based hydrological model and machine learning model to improve the predictive capability for semi arid basins we developed three hybridization approaches that combine the simulations of the hydrologiska byråns vattenbalansavdelning hbv model with long short term memory lstm neural networks in particular one tight hybridization model is developed to consider the feedback between the lstm model and the hbv model further we investigated the predictive capability of both standalone hbv and lstm models with short length data for training i e one year data in the context of poorly gauged basins the results show distinct improvements in the three types of hybrid models when compared with the hbv model and standalone lstm model in terms of both nse 12 3 25 6 and kge 6 67 9 the model performance of the tight hybridization is the best among all the hybrid models not only in terms of metrics but also hydrological signatures and the simulation of extreme flows when calibrated with short length data records the lstm was more robust than hbv producing acceptable nse and kge values moreover there is a strong correlation 0 92 between lstm model performance and the similarity of flow duration curves fdcs between streamflow series in the calibration and validation periods the results suggest that the hybridization of lstm and hbv may provide an enhanced simulation capacity for semi arid regions besides the lstm model can be successfully calibrated with representative short length data and the characteristics of the representative short length data are found this study provides new insights into the potential use of hybridized machine learning in hydrological simulations keywords hybridization machine learning lstm hbv streamflow simulation calibration data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction the availability of water resources is closely connected to the sustainability of human society and ecosystems makkeasorn et al 2008 shen and chen 2010 however water resources are scarce especially in the arid and semi arid regions as a result of the limited holdings of water resources and the pressure of growing water consumption gunkel et al 2015 wheater et al 2007 climate change would likely contribute to growing aridity greve et al 2019 lian et al 2021 lickley and solomon 2018 ullah et al 2022 reducing renewable surface water and groundwater resources and intensifying the water cycle including its variability and the severity of wet and dry events allan et al 2020 therefore the hydrological regimes particularly in the arid and semi arid regions will likely be affected and thus these areas face the greatest pressure to deliver and manage freshwater resources huang et al 2016 lian et al 2021 besides effective water management prompt response to extreme events like floods is also necessary in arid and semi arid regions since floods are infrequent but extremely damaging wheater et al 2007 streamflow prediction i e rainfall runoff modeling is a long lasting challenge in the field of hydrology which is closely related to water resources management and flood control noori kalin 2016 xiang et al 2020 yaseen et al 2015 however streamflow prediction in arid and semi arid areas is more difficult than in temperate areas due to the high variability of rainfall in space and time soil type land cover and the associated complex hydrological processes jiang et al 2015 ye et al 1997 zoccatelli et al 2020 since accurate streamflow prediction leads to effective water resources management and flood warning gao et al 2020 it is valuable and necessary to enhance the performance of rainfall runoff models over arid and semi arid regions ghaith et al 2020 rainfall runoff models can be generally divided into three categories physically based models conceptual models and data driven models devia et al 2015 different from the physically interpretable models like physically based or conceptual models data driven models can provide limited physical insights due to their black box nature but with the low computational complexity and high model accuracy data driven models have been widely used in streamflow prediction yaseen et al 2015 especially machine learning ml models such as artificial neural networks ann nourani 2017 support vector machine svm lin et al 2013 and fuzzy logic method wang and altunkaynak 2012 owing to the lag effects of hydrological events the majority of hydrological variables e g runoff are time dependent mao et al 2021 as a consequence some types of ml models like feed forward ann may not be suitable for streamflow prediction because the sequential information will be lost during the input data processing kao et al 2020 as an alternative the recurrent neural networks model rnn was designed to process time series data with a structure of internal memory the special architecture of rnn results in a good performance in time series prediction but also leads to the problems of gradient exploding or vanishing for this reason the long short term memory neural network lstm was developed based on the rnn structure to overcome the problem hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 as one popular method of deep learning dl the applications of lstm such as handwriting recognition yeh and chen 2011 speech recognition graves et al 2013 and machine translation sutskever et al 2014 have been surging in the last decade thanks to the development of computer technology le et al 2019 a growing number of studies on lstm have also been done in the fields of hydrology in recent years and it has been perceived as an applicable method of rainfall runoff prediction gao et al 2020 kratzert et al 2018 xiang et al 2020 nevertheless some hydrologists still doubt the feasibility of using ml models for rainfall runoff prediction due to the little connection to the underlying physical processes being modeled beven 2020 elshorbagy et al 2010 see et al 2007 with the exception of the tough work to explain ml models rudin 2019 the integration of physically interpretable models and ml models i e hybridization becomes another plausible idea jiang et al 2020 nourani et al 2014 hybrid models can leverage the strengths of the respective models and have been recently implemented in rainfall runoff prediction currently the commonly used hybridization approach is adding the outputs of physically informed models into ml models the outputs of physically informed models could be simulated streamflow as well as intermediate variables e g soil moisture humphrey et al 2016 okkan et al 2021 similarly konapala et al 2020 and cho kim 2022 used the outputs of physically informed models as inputs of lstm the difference is that they used lstm to simulate the residual between observation and streamflow predicted by physically informed models according to the hybridization approach mentioned above the connections between the physically informed models with ml models are unidirectional and have no feedback kraft et al 2022 proposed a hybrid hydrological model h2m between lstm and a hydrological model the meteorological forcing data static variables and water storage from the hydrological model are used as inputs of lstm then the lstm model yields the five coefficients of the hydrological model for runoff prediction at each timestep considering the differences between the two hybridization approaches we use loose hybridization and tight hybridization to represent the two approaches respectively however a comparison of different hybrid approaches in semi arid climatic conditions is rarely reported generally speaking a majority of rainfall runoff models need calibration to adjust model parameters for satisfactory performance on streamflow simulation arsenault et al 2018 data driven models especially ml models are always considered data demanding gauch et al 2021 hence generally the length of data for model calibration are considered as long as possible arsenault et al 2018 shen et al 2022 therefore this approach is limited in data scarce regions with insufficient data for model calibration nevertheless researchers found that longer calibration data length did not inevitably lead to a better model performance perrin et al 2007 sun et al 2017 and sorooshian et al 1983 suggested using one full hydrological year as the minimum length for the calibration of a conceptual model the study of perrin et al 2007 shows that 350 calibration days sampled out of a longer dataset including dry and wet conditions are sufficient to obtain robust estimates of model parameters for wetter basins as for ml models a few studies have investigated the impact of training data length on model performance and provided suggestions for the minimum length ayzel and heistermann 2021 gauch et al 2021 kratzert et al 2018 but we often lack datasets with that length in data scarce areas for model training according to ayzel heistermann 2021 the robustness of the lstm model is poor when the length of the training data is one year as the length of training data increases the lstm model converges to a maximum average performance level but there are still some models trained with one year datasets that perform similarly to models trained with long datasets which indicates that the short training dataset also has the potential to make the model perform well do we really need longer data for model training or do we just need some very informative data it is therefore valuable to identify short datasets that lead ml models to perform better and to uncover the characteristics of such short datasets despite the growing applications of ml in hydrological modeling there is limited research exploring the capability of ml models with short length e g one year of training data lu et al 2021 tested the lstm model with a short length of training data on some data scarce basins and found that lstm models can reasonably predict daily streamflow with high nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient when hydrologic variability in the prediction period is similar to the training period unfortunately there is little research on quantitative analysis of the characteristics of promising short datasets thus we hypothesize that a ml model trained with representative one year data is also able to achieve a satisfactory performance e g nse greater than 0 5 representative one year data means that it includes diverse flow conditions reflecting the various phenomena experienced by the catchment given that the questions we are asking in this study are as follows 1 whether hybrid models could enhance model performance when compared to the standalone ml model or process based conceptual model and to what extent the enhancement is if the answer is positive 2 what characteristics of the training data contribute to good model performance when only a short training dataset i e one year data is available 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the weihe river located in central china with a total length of 818 km is the biggest tributary of the yellow river the area of the weihe river basin wrb is around 134 800 km2 guo et al 2017 it is enclosed by the chinese loess plateau and loess is widely distributed in the basin the overall terrain of the wrb is inclined towards the east fig 1 climatologically the wrb is located in a continental monsoon climate zone with semi arid characteristics the annual average temperature is about 12 14 while the mean annual precipitation is around 610 mm which mainly occurs between june and october there has been a continuing decrease in water resources of the wrb in recent years due to the decrease in inflow and the increase in water usage according to the water resources bulletin of shaanxi gansu province and the ningxia hui autonomous region in china the water usage in the wrb reached 6 5 billion m3 in 2018 while the total water resources were 9 5 billion m3 which indicated a severe problem of water shortage in the wrb in this study we focused on the streamflow generation of the main stream of weihe river and the tributary jinghe river the huaxian hydrological station was located in the lower stream of the wrb just upstream the confluence of the luohe river and the weihe river fig 1 the catchment area upstream huaxian station is 104 453 km2 accounting for 77 of the total area of the wrb 2 2 data daily temperature precipitation and potential evapotranspiration were used as basic forcing data in this study specifically hourly temperature data are from the era5 land reanalysis dataset including maximum and minimum temperature therefore daily maximum and minimum temperatures were calculated using hourly data based on the hargreaves formula hargreaves and samani 1985 potential evapotranspiration pet was calculated the multi source weighted ensemble precipitation mswep v2 8 product beck et al 2019 was used as forcing mswep v2 8 features new data sources improved weight maps and less peaky precipitation estimates and covers a longer record spanning from 1979 to 2020 daily streamflow at the huaxian station was provided by the yellow river conservancy committee spanning a period of nearly 14 years 2006 to 2020 3 methodology in this study two experiments were conducted to examine the questions posed above in the first experiment three types of hybridization approaches were proposed for streamflow simulation the performance of the three hybrid models was evaluated and compared with the standalone lstm and hbv models in the second experiment calibration data were split into subsets of one year length we calibrated and trained the standalone hbv model and lstm model with one year subsets and evaluated the two models for the whole validation period and the performance of the two models on each year in the validation period was also tested to explore the underlying relationship between the data in calibration and validation periods 3 1 hbv model the hydrologiska byråns vattenbalansavdelning hbv model is a semi distributed conceptual hydrological model originally developed by sweden meteorology and hydrology institute smhi bergström 1976 the structure of the hbv model can be generally divided into four parts i e snow routine soil routine response routine and routing routine in the snow routine precipitation accumulates as snow if the temperature is below the threshold temperature tt and melt of snow starts and meltwater is calculated with a simple degree day method if the temperature is above tt in the soil routine the recharge to the upper groundwater box and the actual evapotranspiration are calculated based on the ratio between the current water content of the soil box and its maximum value in the response routine the outflows of the upper and lower groundwater boxes are calculated through a simple linear reservoir method in the routing routine the generated runoff of one timestep is distributed on the following time steps based on an equilateral triangular weighting function due to the simple but robust model structure and the good adaptivity in the semi arid region li et al 2009 masih et al 2010 the hbv model was used as the benchmark model as well as the input of hybrid ml models in this study in addition the application of the hbv model on rainfall runoff prediction was based on the hbv light software seibert and vis 2012 which requires daily precipitation air temperature and potential evapotranspiration data as model inputs 3 2 lstm model lstm neural network first proposed by hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 is a special type of recurrent neural network rnn and has been widely used in classifying processing and predicting based on time series data the lstm architecture gets better performance in long term memory than rnn and overcomes the gradient exploding and vanishing weakness of rnn as a result of the replacement of the traditional rnn unit with a memory block a common lstm unit is composed of a cell an input gate an output gate and a forget gate the lstm model structure is described by the following equations 1 f t σ w f h t 1 x t b f 2 i t σ w i h t 1 x t b i 3 c t tanh w c h t 1 x t b c 4 c t f t c t 1 i t c t 5 o t σ w o h t 1 x t b o 6 h t o t t a n h c t where x t is the input vector to the lstm unit f t is the forget gate s activation vector i t is the input gate s activation vector o t is the output gate s activation vector h t is the hidden state vector also known as the output vector of the lstm unit c t is the cell input activation vector c t is the cell state vector w and b are weight matrices and bias vector parameters which need to be updated during training 3 3 hybrid model in this study three types of hybrid models that integrate the outputs of the hbv model into lstm were proposed for streamflow prediction the difference between the three types of hybrid models is that the first two models are in loose hybridization while the third model is in tight hybridization in this study hybrid1 hybrid2 and hybrid3 are used to denote the three hybridization approaches respectively as shown in fig 2 a the outputs of the hbv model are used as inputs of the ltsm model to simulate streamflow or the streamflow residual i e hbv simulated streamflow minus observed streamflow in the hybrid1 and hybrid2 approaches in the hybrid3 approach the inputs of the lstm model are the same as the hybrid1 and hybrid2 approaches while the outputs of the lstm models include two parts simulated streamflow as well as parameters of the hbv model the parameter set is transmitted to the hbv model subsequently and a feedback structure is formed the hybridization processes of the hybrid3 approach at each timestep are depicted in detail in fig 2b 3 4 experimental design as mentioned above two experiments were carried out in this study the first experiment aims to investigate the enhancement of hybrid models to the standalone ml and conceptual model and the second experiment aims to explore the feasibility of training the ml model with one year data for streamflow simulation for both experiments we built the hbv model based on the hbv light software and run the monte carlo simulation 100 000 times then selected 100 parameter sets with the best model performance in terms of the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse for all the ml models including the standalone lstm and hybrid models we trained 100 times and saved the models when nse values exceed 0 5 in the training period as an ensemble all models were built based on a one layer structure with 20 nodes using the keras library in python 3 9 we trained the models with a batch size of 10 using a stochastic gradient descent optimization algorithm called adam and mean square error mse as the loss function for the hybrid3 approach we used a weighted mse for training based on observed streamflow and simulated streamflow from both the hbv model and lstm model the ratio of mse of the two models is tested from 0 2 0 8 to 0 5 0 5 and finally set as 0 2 0 8 the input sequence length was set as 60 and the initial learning rate was set as 0 001 referring to the setup in lu et al 2021 all the model inputs were standardized within the range of 0 to 1 and all the negative values are set to zero before model evaluation 3 4 1 experiment 1 enhancement of hybrid models five models were built and calibrated trained i e the hbv model the standalone lstm model and three hybrid models in this study the hbv model and standalone lstm model were set as benchmark models all models were trained and calibrated with long continuous data set i e from 2006 to 2015 and tested and validated over the period from 2016 to 2020 the inputs of the hbv model and lstm model are the same i e the basic meteorological data as for the three hybrid models the inputs include the basic meteorological data as well as the output of the hbv model see table 1 for details of input output and calibration training hereafter we do not differentiate the two terms target for each model table 1 3 4 2 experiment 2 feasibility of model training with one year data in the second experiment we intended to explore the feasibility of using a short length of data to train ml models therefore we split the original calibration data series into 9 subsets with a one year length then each subset was used to calibrate and train the hbv and standalone lstm models the performance of the two models was tested on the same validation period as in experiment 1 i e 2016 2020 as well as each year in the validation period 3 5 evaluation criteria in this study the evaluation and comparison of model performance are not only based on the metrics of hydrograph similarity but also on the hydrological signatures to explore hydrological processes simulated by different models regarding the metrics of hydrograph similarity we use nse and kge to quantify the general model performance and the three decompositions of kge to evaluate the model performance from different aspects six hydrological signatures are used to characterize a wide variety of hydrological features such as the baseflow contribution flashiness of flood etc the details of metrics and signatures are shown in table 2 moreover the flow duration curve fdc is also used to characterize the streamflow in order to quantitively compare the similarity of fdcs between the calibration period and validation period we employed the metric r fdc which was proposed by westerberg et al 2011 for model calibration purposes as illustrated in fig 3 the area under the fdc is divided into a certain number n of equal discharge volume bins resulting in n 1 equally spaced evaluation points ep for each ep a perfect fit gets a score s of 0 while values at the lower limit and upper limit get a score of 1 and 1 respectively those values within or outside the limits are linearly inter or extrapolated the metric r fdc is thus calculated as 7 r fdc 1 i 1 n 1 s i n 1 therefore a simulation with a perfect fit to the crisp discharge i e discharge at evaluation points in the fdc at all eps received a r fdc value of 1 and if the simulated discharge is at either limit for all eps this resulted in a r fdc value of 0 in this study 20 equal bins are used i e n 20 and the upper and lower limits are set as 10 of observed discharge at each ep 4 results 4 1 overall model performance as described in section 3 4 we trained the hbv model standalone lstm model and three hybrid models and saved models when nse exceeds 0 5 in the training period as ensembles as a result all 100 runs of standalone lstm hybrid1 and hybrid2 models satisfied the criterion while only 69 runs of the hybrid3 model met thus we calculated the metrics during the validation period using the median streamflow values of each ensemble as shown in table 3 as shown in table 3 the nse values of the median output of the hbv model and the standalone lstm model are similar and the nse value of the standalone lstm model is slightly higher than that of the hbv model however the kge value of the hbv model is much higher than that of the standalone lstm model through the comparison of the three decompositions of kge it is found that the correlation coefficients r of the hbv and lstm are close but the α and β values of the hbv model are greater than 1 indicating that the standard deviation and mean value of the hbv simulated streamflow are higher than the observed streamflow while that of the standalone lstm model is just the opposite however the degree of deviation of the hbv model in α and β values is less than that of the lstm model on the other hand the nse value and the kge value of the hybrid3 model are the best among the five models and the hybrid1 model follows the kge values of the hybrid3 and hybrid1 models increase by 68 and 64 referring to the standalone lstm model the α value of the hybrid2 model is the closest to 1 indicating that the variance of the simulated streamflow of the hybrid2 model is the closest to that of the observed streamflow the β value of the hybrid3 model is the closest to 1 indicating that the mean value of the simulated streamflow of the hybrid3 model is the closest to that of the observed streamflow we also plot the boxplot of metrics using the ensemble of each model as shown in fig 4 the box lengths of all five metrics of the hbv model are the longest indicating that the uncertainty of the hbv model is higher than that of other ml models in other words the model performance of ml models is more stable nevertheless from table 3 and fig 4 we can see that the r values of the hbv model and the lstm model are quite similar thus the underlying cause for the enhancement of the hybrid models might be the improvement in α and β it is obvious that the α and β values of the lstm model are lower than 1 indicating the variability and mean of the streamflow simulated by the lstm model are underestimated on the contrary the α and β values of the hbv model are higher than 1 but they are closer to 1 than those of the lstm model thus the integration of the hbv model and the lstm model resulted in the balance of the α values and the α values of the two hybrid models are closer to 1 than those of both the hbv model and lstm model but the β values of the three hybrid models seem to be influenced by the hbv model and are greater than 1 as the hbv model 4 2 performance of signatures in order to make a more detailed analysis of the simulation results of each model we draw the violin plot of each signature using the ensemble results of each model fig 5 overall hbv has a much more elongated distribution for most signatures indicating that the simulated flows spread prominently on the contrary hybrid1 shows a distinct peak on the kernel density curve for all signatures indicating very stable simulations during the validation period the base flow index bfi is a signature that depicts the importance of the baseflow process and a high bfi value indicates high residence time from fig 5a we can see that most of the lstm hybrid2 and the hybrid3 models can reproduce the bfi indicating a strong skill to capture the slow groundwater processes in contrast the hbv models and the hybrid1 models slightly overestimated the bfi value indicating that the slow flow process is not well represented the runoff ratio rr is the fraction of precipitation that becomes runoff and can be calculated at different scales a low total runoff ratio total rr at a multiannual scale means high overall water loss to deep groundwater and low event runoff ratio event rr means more drainage and large storage mcmillan 2020 fig 5b and fig 5c show that the hybrid3 and hybrid1 models resulted in the closest rr to the level of observed streamflow series at the total and event scale respectively on the contrary the lstm models significantly underestimated rr indicating the water balance may be not conserved or most rainwater is retained in the soil this is consistent with the low α and β values in the previous section the value of event rr 0 041 is just half of that 0 086 for total rr red dash lines in fig 5 which demonstrates the importance of slow runoff processes as a significant proportion of rainfall reaches the stream outside the event window somehow the ratios of total rr over event rr are not well captured by all but the hybrid3 model half flow date hfd is the date on which the cumulative discharge since the beginning of the water year october 1 september 31 exceeds half of the total annual discharge hfd is a regime signature and a later hfd corresponds to higher elevation and more snow dominated regimes addor et al 2014 from fig 5d we can see that a few hbv models and hybrid2 models as well as some hybrid3 models see the ends of the violins can reproduce the hfd but most of the hbv models seem to overestimate the hfd value while all the hybrid models seem to underestimate fig 5d indicates that the hbv models result in slightly more snow dominated regimes than the observed streamflow series while the ml models result in less snow dominated i e more precipitation dominated regimes and the degrees of underestimation of the lstm hybrid1 hybrid2 and hybrid3 models descend successively fdc slope is the slope of a flow duration curve between two normalized streamflow percentiles in this study the percentiles we chose for the calculation of fdc slope are 33rd and 66th which correspond to the midsegment of fdc a steep fdc slope leads to small soil capacity and higher overland flow while a flatter slope indicates a more sustained groundwater response yilmaz et al 2008 from fig 5e we can see some hbv and hybrid3 models can reproduce the fdc slope and more hbv and hybrid3 models result in steeper fdc slopes than the observation indicating the hbv and hybrid3 model simulations present small soil capacity and higher overland flow and the other three ml models are on the contrary rising limb density rld is the ratio between the number of peaks and the total duration of the rising limbs of the hydrograph rld is a signature that reflects the shape and smoothness of a hydrograph and indicates the flashiness of the catchment response from the aspects of hydrological processes sawicz et al 2011 high rld shows that routing and delay processes dominate over hillslope processes shamir et al 2005 fig 5f shows that only some hybrid3 models can reproduce the rld and the other four models underestimate the rld indicating that the hybrid3 model tends to overestimate the domination of routing processes over hillslope processes while the other four models are on the contrary 4 3 performance of extreme flow simulations fig 6 shows the flow duration curves fdcs of the observed streamflow and simulated streamflow for each model it is obvious that marked differences in high flow simulation exist among different model groups fig 6 a the hbv model and the hybrid2 model overestimate the high flows while the standalone lstm model underestimates them the fdc of the hybrid1 and hybrid3 models simulated streamflow coincides with that of the observed streamflow in the extremely high flow section which indicates that the hybrid1 and hybrid3 models appear to have lower errors in high flows this may explain the best nse and kge values achieved shown in table 3 moreover we can see that hybrid1 hybrid2 and the standalone lstm model tend to overestimate the low flows while the hybrid3 and hbv models tend to underestimate but the errors of all model simulations in low flows are less than 50 m3 s which are trivial when compared to those in high flows hydrographs of different models in two typical hydrological years are plotted in fig 7 the left column of fig 7 clearly shows that the hbv model fails to capture the flow dynamics before september 2016 while the other four ml models perform slightly better however all five models overestimate the streamflow in september and october of 2016 it seems that all models are influenced by the high and intensive precipitation which might be incorrectly recorded on the other hand there is a distinguishing difference in the peak flow simulation shown in the right column of fig 7 the hbv model and the hybrid2 model overestimate the peak flow in august while the lstm seems to underestimate it the simulated peak flows of hybrid1 and hybrid3 in august are very close to the observation but the hybrid models overestimate the streamflow between september and october 2020 which is similar to the simulations of the hbv model 4 4 model performance with one year data training accounting for the uncertainty of model parameters the hbv model and the standalone lstm model were calibrated with one year data from 2007 to 2015 respectively and each setup was calibrated 100 times resulting in an ensemble of 100 models the median simulations of ensembles from the hbv model and standalone lstm model were used for model performance evaluation as shown in fig 8 we can see the striking difference in nse and kge for different evaluation periods using various one year data for model calibration in terms of nse we can see that the minimum nse value of the lstm model achieved during the full validation period is 0 392 and the mean nse value is 0 508 while the minimum and mean nse values of the hbv model are 1 261 and 0 222 respectively similarly the lstm outperformed hbv in terms of the kge minimum mean median kge of the lstm and hbv models are 0 325 0 514 0 510 and 0 337 0 445 0 449 over the full validation period recall that the nse and kge of lstm and hbv trained with full calibration data 2006 2015 are 0 602 and 0 593 and 0 474 and 0 719 during the full validation period respectively table 3 these results clearly show the advantage of lstm over hbv using one year data for model training nevertheless the performance varies with training data from fig 8 we can see that one year data from 2007 2013 and 2014 are able to calibrate hbv to achieve better nse and kge during the full validation period similar but differently one year data from 2007 2010 2012 and 2013 are able to train lstm to achieve better results however the superiority of lstm over hbv may be subverted if one looks at the performance metrics of a certain validation year instead of the full validation period it is the case for the year 2017 a dry year in which the hbv performs overwhelmingly better than lstm either in terms of nse or kge similarly if data from a certain year is used for model training the superiority may also vary for instance hbv performs slightly better in terms of both metrics using data from 2014 for model training nevertheless both models fail to properly reproduce streamflow in the year 2016 which is an extremely dry year as shown in fig 7 as well as in fig a1 fig 9 displays q q plots for all five evaluation years lstm significantly overestimates streamflow in the year 2016 no matter which year the model was trained with similarly the hbv model significantly overestimates streamflow in the year 2020 for all calibration cases since the years 2016 and 2020 are the representative dry and wet years respectively there is a tendency of the hbv model to overestimate the peak flow and underestimate the low flows while the lstm model is on the contrary for the other three validation years i e 2017 2019 two models perform quite similarly nevertheless models trained with one year data of a certain year indeed show various performances on different validation periods however fig 8 and fig 9 also show that models trained for some years e g 2013 and 2014 show strong predictive skills in all validation years 5 discussions 5 1 the superior performance of the hybrid models as reported in section 4 1 a remarkable model performance enhancement of the hybrid models over the standalone lstm and hbv models is revealed the hybrid models are shown to outperform the standalone lstm and hbv in terms of the accuracy of the median simulations as well as reliability and resolution of the prediction distributions moreover hybrid models show high skills to simulate high flows that are significantly underestimated by standalone lstm and overestimated by hbv in addition hybrid models can reproduce the hydrological signatures better than the standalone lstm model indicating the value of integration of hbv model output although hybrid models generally outperform the standalone lstm and hbv models the hybridization approaches do show different performances specifically the hybrid1 model slightly outperforms the hybrid2 model in terms of both nse and kge the signatures of the two model simulations also differ these results are in line with a previous study konapala et al 2020 where the performance of hybrid2 model in general was just slightly better than lstm and conceptual model but very uniform across most catchments studied the performance of the hybrid3 model is the best among all hybrid models which is represented in terms of metrics evaluation hydrological signature reproduction and high low flow simulation the results demonstrate that the tight hybridization approach is more efficient than loose hybridization in streamflow simulation the substance of the hybrid3 approach is the hbv model with time varying parameters which are provided by the lstm neural network the advantage of the hybrid3 approach over the other two hybrid approaches is that it does not have a black box core and can provide physical insights by producing interpretable variables e g soil moisture nevertheless the hybrid3 model in this study still has some shortcomings the hybrid1 and hybrid2 models have close computational efficiency to the standalone lstm model however the training process of the hybrid3 model is more time consuming than the other three ml models and the hybrid3 model is the only model which suffers from non convergency only 69 runs satisfied the condition that nse should exceed 0 5 in the training period the reason for the low robustness and high computational cost of the hybrid3 model might be that the 11 hbv parameters are too many for model training which deserves further investigation in the future the hybrid1 and hybrid3 models are recommended for practical application since they outperform other models the choice of hybrid1 or hybrid3 models depends on whether the practical application scenario focuses on computational efficiency or model accuracy knowing that the integration of the hbv model outputs can improve the performance of standalone lstm we face questions about whether and how the accuracy of the hbv model impacts the performance of hybrid models we tested the hybrid1 model with streamflow of different levels of uncertainty specifically the hybrid1 model was run with observed streamflow series instead of hbv simulated streamflow and set as the benchmark gradually the streamflow input of hybrid1 models was disturbed by additive gaussian noises of 1 8 standard deviations all the hybrid models mentioned above were trained up to 200 epochs with the same hyperparameters introduced in section 3 4 the trained model at each epoch was tested in terms of nse during the full validation period i e 2016 2020 fig 10 shows the curves of dynamic nse values in the full validation period it is obvious that the nse value reached convergence rapidly and remained at approximately 1 stably when the observed streamflow series was used while for the cases that observed streamflow was disturbed with one and two σ there was a distinct decrease in both the convergence rates and the convergence values of nse however if the uncertainty of the observed streamflow series is very large i e noises with 8 σ the reduction in the convergence rates and the convergence values of nse gradually became smaller and the final convergence values of nse were around 0 6 which is close to the performance of the standalone lstm model black dashed line in fig 10 therefore the performance of hybrid models will do better if the outputs of the hbv model become more accurate and vice versa however there exists a bottom line where the performance of hybrid models will not reach below and the performance at the bottom line corresponds to the performance of the standalone lstm model 5 2 the feasibility of model calibration using one year data from fig 8 we can see the average performance of the lstm model on the full validation period is better than the hbv model indicating that the lstm model is more robust than the hbv model when using one year data for model calibration this finding is different from the research by ayzel and heistermann 2021 they tested the hourly runoff simulations by the conceptual gr4h model the lstm model and the gru model in six camels basins they found that the gr4h models are more robust and perform better compared with the two ml models using one year data for calibration the difference in findings might come from the model structure difference between hbv and gr4h which has only four parameters on the other hand both studies are case studies and the similarity of flows between the calibration and validation data sets might be another reason to look into the question of why some years are capable to constrain the models to reproduce streamflow well the flow duration curve fdc of the nine individual years was plotted against that of the full validation period fig 11 intuitively the fdcs of years 2008 2009 and 2015 are the most different compared to the fdc of streamflow in 2016 2020 all three years are very dry and the maximums are no more than 35 of the maximum of 2016 2020 this indicates that data from a dry period are not very informative and may explain the poor performance of hbv and lstm shown in fig 8 this is in line with previous studies with process based models brigode et al 2015 seibert and beven 2009 sun et al 2017 on the contrary the fdc of the year 2011 is also very different but in another way although the year 2011 is very wet models calibrated with such data are not skillful during the full validation period a careful check shows that an extremely large flash flood event occurred of which the generation mechanism is probably different from others this indicates that the extreme flood event is disinformative for the model calibration beven and westerberg 2011 however models calibrated with one year data from a certain year show different skills when the evaluation is conducted in another year fig 8 to quantify the similarity of fdcs between streamflow series the r fdc between a single year in the calibration period and a single year in the validation period were calculated and shown in fig 12 furthermore we calculated the pearson correlation coefficient between performance metrics in fig 8 with the r fdc in fig 12 it is distinct that there is a strong correlation 0 918 and 0 920 between the r fdc and the model performance metrics i e nse and kge for the lstm model this is the more similar the streamflow between calibration and validation periods the better the lstm model performs during validation periods which is consistent with the results of lu et al 2021 however the correlation coefficients between the r fdc and nse as well as kge for the hbv model are low 0 238 and 0 161 indicating the similarity of streamflow in the frequency domain may not be enough to explain model performance interestingly the lstm performs reasonably well in the extreme wet year 2020 using one year data from 2011 or 2012 but the hbv model fails using either one several studies pool et al 2017 seibert and beven 2009 indicated that high maximum data contained more information although both years are also very wet the flood events are different as shown in fig a1 this may indicate that the runoff generation process is different between 2011 and 2020 and hbv and lstm use the calibration data differently however delving into the issue needs further research which is beyond this study 6 summary and conclusions this work aimed at enhancing streamflow simulation by incorporating process based hydrological model outputs into the ml model and further exploring the feasibility of short length data for ml model calibration to this end two experiments were carried out in the first experiment three types of hybrid models were built based on a conceptual model hbv and a machine learning model lstm with the standalone hbv and lstm models as benchmarks in the second experiment calibration data was split into subsets of one year length and then the performance of the standalone hbv model and lstm model calibrated with such data was tested in addition the performance of the two models on each year in the validation period was also examined to explore the underlying mechanism of model performance based on the results of the two experiments the main conclusions are drawn as follow 1 overall there are distinct improvements in the three types of hybrid models when compared to the hbv model and the standalone lstm model in both nse 12 3 25 6 and kge 6 67 9 the hybrid3 model outperforms the hybrid1 and the hybrid2 indicating that a tight hybridization approach is more efficient than loose hybridization in streamflow simulation however the hybrid1 is more skillful than the hybrid2 indicating that the nonlinear relationship between inputs and streamflow outputs instead of residual is well captured nevertheless all ml based models show greater stability and robustness than the hbv model in reproducing streamflow and signatures 2 in terms of model performance on low and high flows the hbv model and hybrid2 model tend to overestimate high flows while the lstm model tends to underestimate them comparatively simulations of the hybrid1 and hybrid3 models show high consistency with the observed streamflow especially the extreme floods the hbv model tends to underestimate the streamflow in the low flow section while the other three models are on the contrary 3 when using only one year data for calibration on average the performances of the standalone hbv and lstm in the full validation period are similar to the benchmark i e nine year data for calibration however the performance varies with the calibration year the lstm model shows higher stability when compared to the hbv model in the full validation period moreover there is a strong correlation between lstm model performance and the similarity between streamflow series in calibration and validation period while it is not found for the hbv model the generally superior performance of the hybrid models when compared with the hbv and lstm models has demonstrated the potential of hybridization approaches to improve prediction accuracy in semi arid basins although the results presented in this work are case study focused and may not be generalized the methods can be easily applied to other regions and may be of particular interest for arid or semi arid basins where the hydrological regime is extreme and highly variable one year data for model calibration is workable especially for ml models in data scare regions however more tests are needed to reach an undeniable conclusion some questions are still open 1 if a combination of two one year data one extremely dry and another extremely wet for model calibration could achieve better performance and 2 how to find such combinations if the answer is positive future studies may further investigate the capability of ml models with short lengths of data for calibration using large sample hydrological data sets such as the catchment attributes and meteorology for large sample

used using a multiple weighting algorithm mwa a differential split sample testing dsst scheme was used to test the transferability of parameterizations in the optimization and physical model domains data from three experimental sites little washita lw13 in oklahoma everglades in florida and bondville olney sites in illinois were used to verify our proposed approach our findings indicated that the multi model outputs were highly influenced both by the physical and optimization model structures overall our approach performed well in the test of transferability under different weather conditions however we confirmed that the overfitted parameters to the in situ measurements during the calibration period due to the optimization model structures can undermine the transferability of multi model approach also our findings indicate that the estimated soil hydraulic properties during the dry years can be limited in representing the soil wetness conditions for the wet years keywords soil moisture multi model soil moisture simulation approach parameter transferability contrasting weather conditions data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction soil moisture near the land surface and root zone play the key role in hydrology meteorology and agriculture various physically based hydrologic models such as common land model clm oleson et al 2010 noah land surface model noah lsm ek et al 2003 soil water atmosphere plant swap van dam et al 1997 variable infiltration capacity vic liang et al 1994 and hydrus 2d simunek et al 1999 have been developed used for estimating soil moisture dynamics usually these models mimic hydrologic processes in nature by adapting their own model structures and parameterization schemes with various input variables i e weather forcings soils vegetations initial bottom boundary conditions in order to obtain their own input parameters that can represent actual field conditions different approaches by integrating hydrologic models with optimization schemes such as genetic algorithm ga holland 1975 markov chain monte carlo mcmc kuczera and parent 1998 shuffled complex evolutionary university of arizona sce ua duan et al 1992 generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue beven and binley 1992 beven and freer 2001 have been used similarly hydrologic models have their unique input parameters and model structures indicating that these models outputs include their own structural features advantages and disadvantages in order to address these limitations several studies suggested multi model based approaches that can capture and combine the strengths of various hydrologic models hoetting et al 1999 raftery et al 2005 wöhling and vrugt 2008 duan and phillips 2010 wu et al 2012 xia et al 2014 kim et al 2015 ardilouze et al 2017 sándor et al 2017 bai et al 2018 these approaches use the average outputs or the single value closer to the observation furthermore various weighting schemes such as bayesian model averaging bma hoetting et al 1999 multi model combination algorithm mca devineni et al 2008 li and sankarasubramanian 2012 simple model average sma krishnamurti et al 1999 weighted average method wam shamseldin and liang 1997 etc can be used to improve qualities of the multi model outputs thus various multi model approaches integrated with optimizations have been developed used to reduce uncertainties due to physical model structures basically optimization schemes have different mechanisms defined as optimization model structures for finding solutions through their own random number generators these indicate that different mechanisms of various optimization schemes may cause uncertainties as much as physical model structures many studies shin and mohanty 2013 gabrielle et al 2006 sun et al 2017 ma et al 2017 etc about minimizing evaluating uncertainties of optimization schemes have been done conducting but multi model approaches that reflect the characteristics due to different mechanisms of optimizations has not been considered yet by considering both physical and optimizations model structures we can derive more various combinations of root zone soil moisture dynamics that can cover expanded searching spaces probabilities of finding solutions in given environment in other word the coverage of expanded searching space can contribute to the improvement of soil moisture estimation by combining multiple weighting scheme based on different wetness conditions another weakness of optimization based physical models is the transferability regarding whether or not calibrated model parameters can be still valid for validation periods under different weather conditions usually validation results predicted by calibrated parameters have relatively higher bias compared to calibration model outputs under different weather conditions this indicates that the transferability between calibration and validation is only valid while weather forcings have less difference across calibration and validation periods otherwise the transferability may beg a question of the stationarity hypothesis in the context of contrasting weather conditions seiller et al 2012 conducted a multi model evaluation using twenty lumped hydrologic models for streamflow with different weather conditions furthermore several studies have proposed validation methods that can perform better under contrasting climate conditions using a differential split sample test dsst refsgaard and knudsen 1996 xu 1999 donnelly makowecki and moore 1999 seibert 2003 xu et al 2005 refsgaard et al 2006 vaze et al 2010 merz et al 2011 dsst adapts the principle for calibrating hydrologic models on pre change data and then validated on post change data thus this study aims to explore the characteristics due to different physical optimizing model structures and transferability of multi model simulation approach under different weather conditions the main objective of this study is to develop a new multi model based near surface soil moisture simulation approach using three hydrologic models in combination with three optimization techniques based on a multiple weighting algorithm mwa and to provide reliable transferability in predicting near surface soil moisture dynamics for calibration and validation periods under contrasting weather conditions 2 material and methodology 2 1 conceptual framework for the multi model based soil moisture simulation approach we developed a multi model based soil moisture simulation approach that can reflect the strengths of the combination of different hydrologic models and optimization schemes for considering both physical e g input data governing equation initial condition bottom boundary condition etc model and optimization different mechanisms for finding soil hydraulic properties through random number generators structural uncertainties here the concept of near surface soil moisture data assimilation scheme developed by ines and mohanty 2008a was adapted to optimize estimated soil moisture values closer to in situ measurements by tuning the input parameters table 1 of hydrologic models we selected the widely used hydrologic models such as clm noah lsm and swap to predict near surface soil moisture dynamics then these models were integrated with genetic algorithm ga holland 1975 shuffled complex evolutionary university of arizona sce ua duan et al 1994 and simple iteration algorithm ia shin et al 2016 respectively these nine combined models outputs can capture various uncertainties due to physical and optimization model structures we adapted the multiple weighting algorithm mwa devineni et al 2008 li and sankarasubramanian 2012 to derive multiple weights and then the multi model outputs were adjusted closer to the in situ measurements based on the derived multiple weights furthermore we tested the transferability of our multi model approach under contrasting climatic conditions based on a differential split sample testing dsst klemeš 1986 scheme in fig 1 2 2 multi model soil moisture simulation approach we adapted the concept of near surface 0 5 cm soil moisture data assimilation scheme ines and mohanty 2008a based on a simulation optimization framework the simulation is carried out by running the selected hydrologic models swap noah lsm clm and the outputs are optimized through three different optimization schemes as genetic algorithm ga holland 1975 goldberg 1989 shuffled complex evolution university of arizona sce ua duan et al 1992 and iteration algorithm ia shin et al 2016 individual model parameters as shown in table 1 are determined by minimizing the difference e between observed and simulated soil moisture estimates using the objective

opt and mod are the running index of opt and mod k is the input parameters for swap noah lsm and clm table 1 obssm is the observed soil moisture simsm is the simulated soil moisture t is the running index of time and t is the simulation period used in this study respectively ga searches the optimized solutions based on the precept of natural selection mechanism holland 1975 goldberg 1989 through the ga operator comprised of selection crossover and mutation ga generates new random parameters called as chromosomes in an array in the given generation g ga optimizes the solutions by minimizing the difference between observation and simulation values the sce ua method is a global optimization strategy to solve a broad class of problems sce ua adapts the strengths of the simplex procedure suggested by nelder and mead 1965 based on the concepts of controlled random search price 1977 competitive evolution holland 1975 and the newly developed complex shuffling schemes duan et al 1992 jeon et al 2014 also we used the simple ia scheme shin et al 2016 that can generate a sequence of improving approximate solutions the ga sce ua and ia schemes have been successfully used for solving the complex problems the readers are referred to holland 1975 goldberg 1989 duan et al 1992 ines and mohanty 2008a ines and mohanty 2008b ines and mohanty 2009 and shin et al 2012 shin et al 2016 for the sake of brevity the control variables for ga sce ua and ia are shown in table 2 2 3 hydrologic models in this study we selected the swap noah lsm and clm models for the multi model approach swap is a physically based model that simulates the processes of the soil water atmosphere plant system kroes et al 1999 van dam et al 1997 the near surface soil moisture dynamics in the soil column can be described using the one dimensional richards equation swap solves the equation 2 numerically based on the finite difference scheme suggested by belmans et al 1983 2 θ t c h h t k h h z 1 z s h where θ

functions ksat is the saturated hydraulic conductivity cm d 1 and m 1 1 n swap estimates the potential evapotranspiration using the penman monteith equation with daily weather data the partition of potential transpiration and evaporation is determined by the leaf area index or the soil cover fraction then swap calculates the actual evapotranspiration by considering the root water uptake reduction due to water and salinity stress the swap model considers for several combinations of the top atmospheric and bottom boundary conditions van dam et al 1997 moreover this model is a numerical water management tool containing irrigation and drainage modules as well as process based crop growth models including wofost for simulating the impacts of weather soil type plant type and water management on the crop growth van dam et al 1997 van dam 2000 the noah lsm and clm models also simulate vertical soil moisture dynamics in the soil profile these models have different model structures and input parameters climatic forcing datasets soil textures vegetation covers initial and bottom boundary conditions soil layering etc indicating that each model has its own capability and drawbacks the noah lsm model simulates soil moisture values based on a diffusion form of the richards equation eq 2 in eq 6 the equation of clapp and hornberger 1978 was adapted to calculate the hydraulic conductivity and soil water retention in eqs 7 8 the components of evapotranspiration for the noah lsm model is comprised of the soil evaporation canopy evaporation and penman monteith based potential

developed multi model approach these hydrologic models have been validated under various meteorological and environmental conditions wesseling and kroes 1998 droogers and bastiaanssen 2002 van dam et al 1997 ahmad et al 2002 ncep 2005 oleson et al 2010 kim et al 2015 zheng et al 2017 among other the search spaces of input parameters for three models are shown in table 1 in this study the soil profile was discretized by 33 computational layers for the swap model the soil column at the near surface of 10 cm 1 10th layer had intervals of 1 cm the sub surface 11 20th and 20 32nd layers 10 60 cm and 60 200 cm from the soil surface were discretized at the intervals of 5 cm and 10 cm 20 cm for the 33rd layer respectively the soil column total depth 200 cm for the noah lsm model was discretized by seven computational layers with the thickness of 5 5 10 10 20 30 and 120 cm the clm model has the soil profile discretized into 10 computational layers and the layer thicknesses increase with the soil depth such as 1 75 2 76 4 55 7 5 12 36 20 38 33 60 55 39 91 33 and 113 7 cm from the soil surface total depth 343 cm swap that can consider finer soil layers has the good performance in simulating soil moisture dynamics and pressure head gradients instantly responding to weather conditions at the near surface 0 10 cm van dam et al 1997 while the swap model is limited in simulating regional and seasonal variations of boundary fluxes at the lower boundary kroes et al 1999 noah lsm also performed well in humid wet hydroclimate regions koren et al 1999 sridhar et al 2002 ek et al 2003 with limitations in application to arid hydroclimate regions due to negligible latent heat flux associated strongly with evaporation and distribution of soil moisture at the near soil during the dry condition katata et al 2007 compared to swap and clm the noah lsm model also has the relatively thicker soil layers at the top soil layer sahoo et al 2008 clm adapting the simple groundwater model simgm niu et al 2007 captures well the variability of ground water table with the unevenly discretized soil layers that can simulate better infiltration and evaporation fluxes sahoo et al 2008 but this model calculating runoff generation based on topographic information might cause uncertainties in simulating subsurface runoff li et al 2011 2 4 multi model weighting algorithm mwa the multi model approach adapted the mwa scheme to calculate a multiple set of weights based on the land surface wetness conditions mwa assesses the model performance along the calibration period t 1 2 3 nc and estimates the multi model prediction across the validation period t nc 1 nc 2 n here we estimate the near surface 0 5 0 10 cm soil moisture predictions simsmm t with the selected hydrologic and optimization model combinations m 1 m m is the nine combination of swap noah lsm and clm integrated with ga sce ua and ia with the identical calibration period t 1 nc the difference ε t m w c between observed and simulated values were calculated using the eq 12 during the calibration period then we estimated the multiple weights w t m w c eq 13 based on the different land surface wetness conditions wc 1 for wet wc 2 for normal and wc 3 for dry and the near surface soil moisture weighted soil moisture wsm values were adjusted closer to the in situ measurements based on the estimated

considered and assessed in adapting suitable soil moisture prediction approaches temporal transferability can be defined as the model ability that can perform with the same similar accuracy under different weather conditions during calibration and validation in this study the dsst scheme was suggested for testing the transferability of hydrologic models associated with optimizations klemeš 1986 here the dsst scheme means the cross validation under contrasted weather conditions in time as the selected models were tested for calibration and validation under certain weather conditions wet to dry or dry to wet years in the context of cross validations using the dsst scheme the model transferability was assessed respectively 2 6 descriptions of data and study sites the little washita 13 lw 13 in 1997 oklahoma everglades 2017 florida bondville bond in 1994 1997 and 2003 illinois and olney oln in 1998 and 2004 illinois sites were selected for testing the performance of this multi model assimilation approach fig 2 the in situ soil moisture data were collected during the southern great plains experiment sgp97 june 18th july 18th 1997 mohanty et al 2002 and international soil moisture network ismn for everglades bondville and olney https ismn geo tuwien ac at ismn the lw 13 site has the in situ soil moisture for 23 days at the soil depth of 0 5 cm while the daily soil moisture data were measured in the depth of soil 0 10 cm for the everglades site also the bondville and olney sites provide the measurements for 12 13 days at the soil depth of 0 10 cm the lw 13 loam everglades find sand bondville silt loam and olney silt loam sites have various soil characteristics with native grass cover daily weather datasets such as precipitation wind speed maximum and minimum temperature and solar radiation for the input parameters of hydrologic models were collected from the usda agricultural research service ars 136 for the lw 13 http ars mesonet org micronet weather station in oklahoma national centers for environmental information ncei https www1 ncdc noaa gov pub data uscrn products daily01 in florida and the illinois state water survey http www isws illinois edu warm in illinois the initial condition ic and bottom boundary conditions bbc at the lw 13 everglades bondville and olney sites were set as 100 cm from the soil surface obtained from ismn note that we tested the model performances with 100 150 and 200 cm of ic bbc from the soil surface and selected 100 cm which is closer to measurements of ic bbc at the lw 13 everglades sites because ic and bbc were unknown for validation of the multi model based soil moisture simulation approach the estimated soil water retention curves based on the mualem van genuchten parameters α n θ res θ sat ksat were compared with the observations note that the observed soil water retention curves were derived based on the collected soil core samples at the lw 13 site we tested our proposed multi model approach at the lw 13 1997 everglades 2017 bondville 1994 bondville 1997 and bondville 2003 and olney 1998 and olney 2004 sites but the clm model at the bondville and olney sites were excluded due to the lack of input variables furthermore uncertainties of the physical and optimization model structures in the multi model approach were analyzed furthermore the cross validation cv of multi model approach was tested at the everglades site with the daily soil moisture measurements in florida in the everglades site the rainfall amount of 255 3 mm was only generated in doy 7 151 while the period of doy 152 304 has the heavy rainfall 1 995 1 mm respectively thus the periods of doy 7 151 and doy 152 304 were defined as the dry and wet days then the cross validation of multi model approach was set as cv1 calibration for the dry days and validation for the wet days and cv2 validation for the dry days and calibration for the wet days respectively as ismn provides consistently the long term soil moisture measurements at the network of multiple locations in illinois we tested the transferability of our multi model approach using the dsst scheme at the bondville and olney sites under the contrasting weather conditions the framework of dsst scheme was shown in fig 3 for example the transfer 1 indicates that we calibrated the model parameters in 1994 and applied the calibrated values to a validation period 1997 the multiple set of weights for individual sites were estimated based on the land surface wetness conditions as shown in table 3 3 results and discussions 3 1 multi model soil moisture simulation approach we tested the multi model soil moisture simulation approach at the lw 13 site oklahoma in fig 4 overall the multi model outputs r 0 783 0 942 and rmse 0 019 0 032 were identifiable with the tdr measurements especially for clm integrated with ga r 0 926 and rmse 0 022 sce ua r 0 942 and rmse 0 026 and ia r 0 956 and rmse 0 027 fig 4g shows the comparison of measured and estimated water retention curves θ h based on the mualem van genuchten mvg parameters indicating the model performances of multi model approach although validations of the estimated physical model parameters for noah lsm and clm were excluded due to the lack of field scale measurements available the good agreement between the estimated and observed water retention curves with small uncertainties demonstrated the robustness of multi model approach based on parameterization scheme fig 4a c show variations in the estimated soil moisture dynamics due to the physical model structures based on individual optimizations ga sce ua or ia the swap and noah lsm models can capture well moisture conditions during the wet and normal days while clm performs well for the dry days also the soil moisture values estimated by noah lsm and swap were sharply changed based on the rainfall while clm was less sensitive although the clm model failed to reach to the maximum soil moisture value in doy 191 rainfall amount 42 8 mm clm showed the good performance under the normal and dry days during doy 172 to 190 fig 4d f shows the variations due to the optimization model structures based on individual hydrologic models swap noah lsm or clm overall variations due to the optimization model structures are relatively smaller than those of the physical models shown in fig 4a c fig 5 a f shows uncertainty ranges of the multi model outputs with all tdr twenty three measurements while fig 5g l indicates the multi model outputs with eleven measurements when we used less number of measurements the near surface soil moisture dynamics in the optimization fig 5g i and physical fig 5j l domains highly varied during the periods which have no in situ measurements noah lsm integrated with three different optimizations ia ga and sce ua had relatively less variations compared to those of swap and clm in the physical model domain also sce ua in the optimization domain had relatively less uncertainties in searching for the solutions fig 5l the model outputs in both the optimization and physical domains usually showed good agreements with the measurements during the simulation period at where the soil moisture data were measured in fig 5g l while uncertainties during the periods no measurements were highly increased these findings obviously showed that qualities of measurements the number of data available measuring intervals etc highly influence on performances of the multi model simulation approach comprising of optimizations adapting hydrologic models fig 6 showed the near surface soil moisture predictions in the optimization and physical domains at the bondville site illinois under different weather conditions we also tested the model performances based on the number of soil moisture measurements available fig 6a b showed the model outputs of individual swap and noah lsm integrated with the optimizations ia ga and sce ua during the whole period twelve measurements respectively swap based model outputs had relatively higher variations than those of noah lsm swap can perform well under the wet condition during the simulation period while noah lsm estimated the model outputs closer to the measurements for the dry conditions but when we used only the seven measurements during the initial period doy 91 210 swap showed high uncertainties in estimating the near surface soil moisture dynamics during doy 201 304 in fig 6c variations of noah lsm simulation outputs also increased but these uncertainties were relatively lower than those of swap as shown in fig 5 the number of soil moisture measurements influenced the ability of hydrologic models and optimization schemes in the model performances these findings indicated that the optimization schemes only fitted the model outputs closer to the in situ measurements during the simulation periods doy 170 197 for lw13 and doy 91 201 for bondville it might suggest that single model based soil moisture estimates with few in situ datasets which are not able to represent the whole simulation period have potential risks that can cause large uncertainties over under estimations these limitations may lead to wrong decisions in planning water resources management when we consider limited in situ soil moisture data in modeling alternatives for minimizing uncertainties need to be suggested figs 7 and 8 and table 4 showed the results of multi model approach for the cross validations at the everglades site in florida in cv1 the calibrated multi model outputs r 0 712 0 838 and rmse 0 016 0 033 integrated with ga sce ua and ia matched well with the daily in situ measurements in fig 7a c although the results of ia based models have small variations however the validation r 0 032 0 705 and rmse 0 029 0 074 results in the wet days cv1 were highly biased compared to the in situ measurements especially for the noah lsm model in doy 261 268 in cv2 the calibrated multi model outputs r 0 540 0 688 and rmse 0 031 0 035 during the wet days were comparable to the measurements with small uncertainties in fig 8 but the results during doy 267 274 were highly biased from the measured data the in situ soil moisture values were rapidly decreased right after the generations of high rainfall amounts of 377 4 doy 157 and 105 6 doy 237 mm while the decreasing of in situ soil moisture values since the rainfall generation of 205 7 mm in doy 253 were delayed only with the additional rainfall generations of 2 4 mm doy 254 256 we infer that the delayed decreasing curve of in situ soil moisture might be due to measuring errors in the field site the multi model outputs r 0 772 0 839 and rmse 0 019 0 049 for the dry validation days showed the overestimated trends compared to the in situ measurements these mean that the calibrated soil hydraulic properties during the wet period were also limited in predicting the soil moisture dynamics for the dry days these results of cross validation demonstrated that considering appropriate ranges of wet to dry conditions highly influence on the performance of optimizations and hydrological models based on parameterization scheme overall the multi models integrated with ga and sce ua performed well during the calibration for both cv 1 and cv 2 periods while the ia based multi model outputs showed small variations in figs 7 and 8 however the ga and sce ua based multi model outputs were highly biased from the in situ measurements during the validation periods in the contrast the ia based multi models consistently showed the good performances with small variations during both the calibration and validation periods in cv 1 and cv 2 it is inferred that the soil hydraulic properties overfitted by ga and sce ua to the in situ measurements during the calibration periods might cause bias in predicting the soil moisture dynamics for validation however the ia based multi models that have small variations indicating relatively less overfitted during the calibration periods showed the relatively better performances in predicting the soil moisture dynamics for validation these findings demonstrated that optimization model structures highly influence on the model performances of hydrological models as much as physical model structures based on different soil wetness conditions we tested our multi model approach at the lw 13 and bondville sites the arithmetic averaged aa and mwa for different soil wetness conditions based soil moisture dynamics during the calibration r 0 939 and rmse 0 012 for aa r 0 925 and rmse 0 013 for mwa and validation r 0 934 0 989 and rmse 0 021 0 040 for aa r 0 881 0 995 and rmse 0 014 0 023 for mwa periods at the lw 13 site are shown in fig 9 the aa based soil moisture of nine combination model outputs had more uncertainties compared to those conditioned by the mwa based on the soil wetness conditions although the correlation aa in the validation of doy 162 175 was slightly higher than that 0 881 of mwa these trends were similarly shown in the results of everglades and bondville sites the mwa based soil moisture values r 0 904 rmse 0 013 for calibration in doy 7 151 and r 0 589 rmse 0 051 for validation in doy 152 304 matched well with the in situ measurements compared to the results r 0 852 rmse 0 016 for calibration and r 0 520 rmse 0 048 for validation of aa in table 5 however the results of the aa r 0 689 and rmse 0 030 mwa r 0 686 and rmse 0 030 based approaches have no differences for calibration doy 152 304 under the wet period while the mwa based soil moisture r 0 866 and rmse 0 023 values were improved for validation compared to those r 0 857 and rmse 0 028 of aa these results might be inferred that the model performance of multi model approach under the wet condition doy 152 304 for calibration was influenced by bias errors including in situ measurements doy 267 274 also we tested our multi model based approach at the bondvill site in 1994 524 3 mm wet year 1997 388 7 mm dry year and 2003 469 1 mm normal year table 6 shows the statistics of aa and mwa based soil moisture dynamics with swap and noah lsm integrated with the optimizations ga ia and sce ua during the calibration period 1994 the aa of multi model outputs r 0 971 and rmse 0 034 showed good agreement with the measurements while the validation results r 0 878 and rmse 0 106 had more uncertainties the similar results were confirmed at the bondville and olney sites as shown in table 6 table 7 shows the weighted values of multi model outputs derived by the mwa scheme at the lw 13 and everglades sites under the wet normal and dry condition in the lw 13 site the ga based noah lsm has the highest weighted value 0 194 under the wet condition while the ia based swap 0 580 clm 0 277 models performed better under the normal and dry condition respectively however the higher weighted values were assigned to the sce ua based 0 173 for calibration in doy 7 151 and ia based 0 272 for calibration in doy 152 304 swap models for the wet condition at the everglades site also ga based clm 0 243 and ia based noah lsm 0 304 models have the relatively higher weighted values than the others during the normal days while the ia based clm 0 226 for calibration in doy 7 151 and 0 257 for calibration in doy 152 304 models still performed well for the dry condition overall the swap and noah lsm models showed the good performances under the wet and normal conditions while clm consistently demonstrated the ability that can respond well to the dry condition these weighted values for the lw 13 and everglades sites in table 7 supported the results in fig 4 and figs 7 8 furthermore the ia scheme integrated with swap noah lsm and clm usually have the relatively higher weighted values for the wet through dry conditions compared to those of sce ua and ga indicating that ia can contribute to the improvement of multi model approach under various wetness conditions overall our multi model approach improved the results compared to those of the arithmetic averages and their uncertainty ranges however these calibration and validation processes were conducted only under the identical weather conditions for each year separately it is still in question with respect to whether or not the estimated parameters can represent the field conditions for individual study sites under the contrasting weather conditions in the context of transferability 3 2 transferability of multi model approach in time we applied the estimated calibrated parameters during the wet year 1994 to other validation years in 1997 dry year and 2003 normal year to test the transferability of parameterization schemes in time at the bondville site fig 10 showed the aa and mwa based soil moisture projections in 1997 and 2003 the aa based soil moisture dynamics r 0 555 0 757 and rmse 0 050 0 073 in 1997 2003 in fig 10a c were highly biased compared to the in situ measurements the mwa based soil moisture values in fig 10d were better identifiable compared to those of the aa approach fig 10c while uncertainties of the mwa based outputs in fig 10b were slightly higher than those of aa approach fig 10a however the mwa based outputs during doy 101 121 191 211 were relatively closer to the measurements compared to those of the aa approach considering that the in situ soil moisture data were measured for every two weeks 14 days uncertainties that were not involved in calculating the statistics r and rmse during the unmeasured days might cause the relatively higher r and rmse than those of the mwa approach although the mwa based outputs also showed uncertainties our multi model approach based on the soil wetness conditions showed the good transferability of parameterization schemes in time we applied the estimated parameters during the dry and normal years in 1997 and 2003 respectively to the wet period 1994 as shown in fig 11 when we considered the transferability of model projections dry to wet years the projected soil moisture dynamics in 1994 based on the estimated soil parameters during the dry year 1997 had more uncertainties than those of the parameter estimates during the normal year 2003 we tested the transferability of our approach at the olney site illinois in 1998 precipitation 739 6 mm and 2004 precipitation 9 mm as shown in the above results our approach adapting the multiple weights based on the different soil wetness conditions could improve the model outputs compared to those of aa in fig 12 a b when we applied the estimated soil parameters during the dry period in 2004 to the normal year 1998 in the transfer 6 the averaged results r 0 754 and rmse 0 136 were highly biased compared to those of our proposed mwa approach with the improved statistics r 0 783 and rmse 0 136 in fig 12c d these model outputs failed to capture the high peaks of soil moisture these results in fig 12 showed critical weakness of parameterization approaches in transferability dry to wet years indicating that estimated optimized parameters of hydrologic model during dry years are not able to mimic soil moisture dynamics for wet years these findings might indicate that the performance of multi model approach is significantly dependent on selection of dry or wet days years in fig 13 we compared the water retention curves θ h using the estimated soil parameters α n θ res θ sat ksat during the calibration periods at the bondville and olney sites with the laboratory based references twenty nine soil textures from sand to clay shin and mohanty 2013 from the unsoda leij et al 1999 soil survey wösten et al 1994 and rosetta schaap et al 1999 database note that we only compared the local scale hydraulic parameters for swap because of the lack of field scale data available for noah lsm and clm the derived θ h curve for the dry year in 1997 trends closer to sand while θ h of the wet and normal years were relatively ranged in clay the curves for the olney site also showed the similar trends as shown in the results of bondville site when we considered that the θ h curves derived by the estimated soil parameters at the identical sites under the contrasting weather conditions it is evident that how different weather conditions considerably influence on the performance of parameterization schemes the differences between the θ h curves might account for the underestimated soil moisture dynamics thus estimated parameters during dry seasons could be limited in projecting soil moisture dynamics for wet periods based on these findings weather conditions need to be considered in estimating soil parameters for multi model simulation approaches thus our mwa approach with the consideration of weather conditions could improve parameterization schemes and minimize their drawbacks in modeling 4 conclusions in this study we developed a multi model based soil moisture simulation approach comprised of various hydrologic models swap noah lsm and clm and optimization schemes ga sce ua ia for better estimating the near surface 0 5 0 10 cm soil moisture dynamics and improving parameterization and their transferability under contrasting weather conditions soil moisture measurements at little washita lw 13 oklahoma everglades florida and bondville olney illinois sites were selected to evaluate our proposed approach the good agreement between the observed and estimated water retention curves demonstrated the robustness of the multi model soil moisture simulation approach at the lw 13 site although the results of swap integrated with ga sce ua and ia were only shown due to the lack of data for noah lsm and clm swap and noah lsm performed well during the wet and normal days in the model performance while the clm model outputs were identifiable with the tdr based soil moisture measurements during the dry days overall variations between the optimization model structures are relatively smaller than those of the physical models however uncertainties due to the physical and optimization model structures were highly increased when seasonal measurements were not representative during the study period especially optimization schemes only fit the simulated results where in situ measurements exist also we found that the overfitted parameters to the in situ measurements during the calibration period due to optimization model structures highly influence on the transferability of multi model approach although we confirmed that our proposed approach considerably improved the multi model outputs with the narrowed uncertainty ranges it indicated that qualities of measurements in modeling might cause large uncertainties during the periods of no measurement furthermore we confirmed that the results derived by our multi model approach adapting the weighting algorithm were more identifiable with the tdr measurements than those of the arithmetic averaging method in the test of transferability the comparisons of water retention curves θ h in the test of transferability under different weather conditions account for these uncertainties because the estimated parameters during the dry years were limited in representing the soil wetness conditions for the wet years overall we demonstrated how various factors i e uncertainties of physical and optimization model structures land surface wetness conditions selection of calibration and validation years qualities of measurements etc significantly influence the performance of multi model approach under various hydro climate regions credit

2303,we developed and tested a multi model based soil moisture simulation approach for improving parameterization scheme and its transferability under contrasting weather conditions three popular hydrologic models in combination with three optimization schemes were adapted to consider uncertainties in physical and optimization model structures for estimating near surface soil moisture dynamics in order to improve parameterization and its transferability under contrasting weather conditions a multiple set of weights based on different land surface wetness conditions wet normal and dry were used using a multiple weighting algorithm mwa a differential split sample testing dsst scheme was used to test the transferability of parameterizations in the optimization and physical model domains data from three experimental sites little washita lw13 in oklahoma everglades in florida and bondville olney sites in illinois were used to verify our proposed approach our findings indicated that the multi model outputs were highly influenced both by the physical and optimization model structures overall our approach performed well in the test of transferability under different weather conditions however we confirmed that the overfitted parameters to the in situ measurements during the calibration period due to the optimization model structures can undermine the transferability of multi model approach also our findings indicate that the estimated soil hydraulic properties during the dry years can be limited in representing the soil wetness conditions for the wet years keywords soil moisture multi model soil moisture simulation approach parameter transferability contrasting weather conditions data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction soil moisture near the land surface and root zone play the key role in hydrology meteorology and agriculture various physically based hydrologic models such as common land model clm oleson et al 2010 noah land surface model noah lsm ek et al 2003 soil water atmosphere plant swap van dam et al 1997 variable infiltration capacity vic liang et al 1994 and hydrus 2d simunek et al 1999 have been developed used for estimating soil moisture dynamics usually these models mimic hydrologic processes in nature by adapting their own model structures and parameterization schemes with various input variables i e weather forcings soils vegetations initial bottom boundary conditions in order to obtain their own input parameters that can represent actual field conditions different approaches by integrating hydrologic models with optimization schemes such as genetic algorithm ga holland 1975 markov chain monte carlo mcmc kuczera and parent 1998 shuffled complex evolutionary university of arizona sce ua duan et al 1992 generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue beven and binley 1992 beven and freer 2001 have been used similarly hydrologic models have their unique input parameters and model structures indicating that these models outputs include their own structural features advantages and disadvantages in order to address these limitations several studies suggested multi model based approaches that can capture and combine the strengths of various hydrologic models hoetting et al 1999 raftery et al 2005 wöhling and vrugt 2008 duan and phillips 2010 wu et al 2012 xia et al 2014 kim et al 2015 ardilouze et al 2017 sándor et al 2017 bai et al 2018 these approaches use the average outputs or the single value closer to the observation furthermore various weighting schemes such as bayesian model averaging bma hoetting et al 1999 multi model combination algorithm mca devineni et al 2008 li and sankarasubramanian 2012 simple model average sma krishnamurti et al 1999 weighted average method wam shamseldin and liang 1997 etc can be used to improve qualities of the multi model outputs thus various multi model approaches integrated with optimizations have been developed used to reduce uncertainties due to physical model structures basically optimization schemes have different mechanisms defined as optimization model structures for finding solutions through their own random number generators these indicate that different mechanisms of various optimization schemes may cause uncertainties as much as physical model structures many studies shin and mohanty 2013 gabrielle et al 2006 sun et al 2017 ma et al 2017 etc about minimizing evaluating uncertainties of optimization schemes have been done conducting but multi model approaches that reflect the characteristics due to different mechanisms of optimizations has not been considered yet by considering both physical and optimizations model structures we can derive more various combinations of root zone soil moisture dynamics that can cover expanded searching spaces probabilities of finding solutions in given environment in other word the coverage of expanded searching space can contribute to the improvement of soil moisture estimation by combining multiple weighting scheme based on different wetness conditions another weakness of optimization based physical models is the transferability regarding whether or not calibrated model parameters can be still valid for validation periods under different weather conditions usually validation results predicted by calibrated parameters have relatively higher bias compared to calibration model outputs under different weather conditions this indicates that the transferability between calibration and validation is only valid while weather forcings have less difference across calibration and validation periods otherwise the transferability may beg a question of the stationarity hypothesis in the context of contrasting weather conditions seiller et al 2012 conducted a multi model evaluation using twenty lumped hydrologic models for streamflow with different weather conditions furthermore several studies have proposed validation methods that can perform better under contrasting climate conditions using a differential split sample test dsst refsgaard and knudsen 1996 xu 1999 donnelly makowecki and moore 1999 seibert 2003 xu et al 2005 refsgaard et al 2006 vaze et al 2010 merz et al 2011 dsst adapts the principle for calibrating hydrologic models on pre change data and then validated on post change data thus this study aims to explore the characteristics due to different physical optimizing model structures and transferability of multi model simulation approach under different weather conditions the main objective of this study is to develop a new multi model based near surface soil moisture simulation approach using three hydrologic models in combination with three optimization techniques based on a multiple weighting algorithm mwa and to provide reliable transferability in predicting near surface soil moisture dynamics for calibration and validation periods under contrasting weather conditions 2 material and methodology 2 1 conceptual framework for the multi model based soil moisture simulation approach we developed a multi model based soil moisture simulation approach that can reflect the strengths of the combination of different hydrologic models and optimization schemes for considering both physical e g input data governing equation initial condition bottom boundary condition etc model and optimization different mechanisms for finding soil hydraulic properties through random number generators structural uncertainties here the concept of near surface soil moisture data assimilation scheme developed by ines and mohanty 2008a was adapted to optimize estimated soil moisture values closer to in situ measurements by tuning the input parameters table 1 of hydrologic models we selected the widely used hydrologic models such as clm noah lsm and swap to predict near surface soil moisture dynamics then these models were integrated with genetic algorithm ga holland 1975 shuffled complex evolutionary university of arizona sce ua duan et al 1994 and simple iteration algorithm ia shin et al 2016 respectively these nine combined models outputs can capture various uncertainties due to physical and optimization model structures we adapted the multiple weighting algorithm mwa devineni et al 2008 li and sankarasubramanian 2012 to derive multiple weights and then the multi model outputs were adjusted closer to the in situ measurements based on the derived multiple weights furthermore we tested the transferability of our multi model approach under contrasting climatic conditions based on a differential split sample testing dsst klemeš 1986 scheme in fig 1 2 2 multi model soil moisture simulation approach we adapted the concept of near surface 0 5 cm soil moisture data assimilation scheme ines and mohanty 2008a based on a simulation optimization framework the simulation is carried out by running the selected hydrologic models swap noah lsm clm and the outputs are optimized through three different optimization schemes as genetic algorithm ga holland 1975 goldberg 1989 shuffled complex evolution university of arizona sce ua duan et al 1992 and iteration algorithm ia shin et al 2016 individual model parameters as shown in table 1 are determined by minimizing the difference e between observed and simulated soil moisture estimates using the objective

opt and mod are the running index of opt and mod k is the input parameters for swap noah lsm and clm table 1 obssm is the observed soil moisture simsm is the simulated soil moisture t is the running index of time and t is the simulation period used in this study respectively ga searches the optimized solutions based on the precept of natural selection mechanism holland 1975 goldberg 1989 through the ga operator comprised of selection crossover and mutation ga generates new random parameters called as chromosomes in an array in the given generation g ga optimizes the solutions by minimizing the difference between observation and simulation values the sce ua method is a global optimization strategy to solve a broad class of problems sce ua adapts the strengths of the simplex procedure suggested by nelder and mead 1965 based on the concepts of controlled random search price 1977 competitive evolution holland 1975 and the newly developed complex shuffling schemes duan et al 1992 jeon et al 2014 also we used the simple ia scheme shin et al 2016 that can generate a sequence of improving approximate solutions the ga sce ua and ia schemes have been successfully used for solving the complex problems the readers are referred to holland 1975 goldberg 1989 duan et al 1992 ines and mohanty 2008a ines and mohanty 2008b ines and mohanty 2009 and shin et al 2012 shin et al 2016 for the sake of brevity the control variables for ga sce ua and ia are shown in table 2 2 3 hydrologic models in this study we selected the swap noah lsm and clm models for the multi model approach swap is a physically based model that simulates the processes of the soil water atmosphere plant system kroes et al 1999 van dam et al 1997 the near surface soil moisture dynamics in the soil column can be

αw is a reduction factor as function of h and accounts for water deficit and oxygen stress feddes and kowalik 1978 the richards equation is solved using an implicit finite difference scheme as described by belmans et al 1983 the soil hydraulic functions are described by analytical expressions of van genuchten 1980 and mualem 1976 4 s e θ h θ r e s θ s a t θ r e s 1 1 α h n m 5 k h k s a t s

functions ksat is the saturated hydraulic conductivity cm d 1 and m 1 1 n swap estimates the potential evapotranspiration using the penman monteith equation with daily weather data the partition of potential transpiration and evaporation is determined by the leaf area index or the soil cover fraction then swap calculates the actual evapotranspiration by considering the root water uptake reduction due to water and salinity stress the swap model considers for several combinations of the top atmospheric and bottom boundary conditions van dam et al 1997 moreover this model is a numerical water management tool containing irrigation and drainage modules as well as process based crop growth models including wofost for simulating the impacts of weather soil type plant type and water management on the crop growth van dam et al 1997 van dam 2000 the noah lsm and clm models also simulate vertical soil moisture dynamics in the soil profile these models have different model structures and input parameters climatic forcing datasets soil textures vegetation covers initial and bottom boundary conditions soil layering etc indicating that each model has its own capability and drawbacks the noah lsm model simulates soil moisture values based on a diffusion form of the richards equation eq 2 in eq 6 the equation of clapp and hornberger 1978 was adapted to calculate the hydraulic conductivity and soil water retention in eqs 7 8 the components of evapotranspiration for the noah lsm model is comprised of the soil evaporation canopy evaporation and penman monteith based potential

developed multi model approach these hydrologic models have been validated under various meteorological and environmental conditions wesseling and kroes 1998 droogers and bastiaanssen 2002 van dam et al 1997 ahmad et al 2002 ncep 2005 oleson et al 2010 kim et al 2015 zheng et al 2017 among other the search spaces of input parameters for three models are shown in table 1 in this study the soil profile was discretized by 33 computational layers for the swap model the soil column at the near surface of 10 cm 1 10th layer had intervals of 1 cm the sub surface 11 20th and 20 32nd layers 10 60 cm and 60 200 cm from the soil surface were discretized at the intervals of 5 cm and 10 cm 20 cm for the 33rd layer respectively the soil column total depth 200 cm for the noah lsm model was discretized by seven computational layers with the thickness of 5 5 10 10 20 30 and 120 cm the clm model has the soil profile discretized into 10 computational layers and the layer thicknesses increase with the soil depth such as 1 75 2 76 4 55 7 5 12 36 20 38 33 60 55 39 91 33 and 113 7 cm from the soil surface total depth 343 cm swap that can consider finer soil layers has the good performance in simulating soil moisture dynamics and pressure head gradients instantly responding to weather conditions at the near surface 0 10 cm van dam et al 1997 while the swap model is limited in simulating regional and seasonal variations of boundary fluxes at the lower boundary kroes et al 1999 noah lsm also performed well in humid wet hydroclimate regions koren et al 1999 sridhar et al 2002 ek et al 2003 with limitations in application to arid hydroclimate regions due to negligible latent heat flux associated strongly with evaporation and distribution of soil moisture at the near soil during the dry condition katata et al 2007 compared to swap and clm the noah lsm model also has the relatively thicker soil layers at the top soil layer sahoo et al 2008 clm adapting the simple groundwater model simgm niu et al 2007 captures well the variability of ground water table with the unevenly discretized soil layers that can simulate better infiltration and evaporation fluxes sahoo et al 2008 but this model calculating runoff generation based on topographic information might cause uncertainties in simulating subsurface runoff li et al 2011 2 4 multi model weighting algorithm mwa the multi model approach adapted the mwa scheme to calculate a multiple set of weights based on the land surface wetness conditions mwa assesses the model performance along the calibration period t 1 2 3 nc and estimates the multi model prediction across the validation period t nc 1 nc 2 n here we estimate the near surface 0 5 0 10 cm soil moisture predictions simsmm t with the selected hydrologic and optimization model combinations m 1 m m is the nine combination of swap noah lsm and clm integrated with ga sce ua and ia with the identical calibration period t 1 nc the difference ε t m w c between observed and simulated values were calculated using the eq 12 during the calibration period then we estimated the multiple weights w t m w c eq 13 based on the different land surface wetness conditions wc 1 for wet wc 2 for normal and wc 3 for dry and the near surface soil moisture weighted soil moisture wsm values were adjusted closer to the in situ measurements based on the estimated

considered and assessed in adapting suitable soil moisture prediction approaches temporal transferability can be defined as the model ability that can perform with the same similar accuracy under different weather conditions during calibration and validation in this study the dsst scheme was suggested for testing the transferability of hydrologic models associated with optimizations klemeš 1986 here the dsst scheme means the cross validation under contrasted weather conditions in time as the selected models were tested for calibration and validation under certain weather conditions wet to dry or dry to wet years in the context of cross validations using the dsst scheme the model transferability was assessed respectively 2 6 descriptions of data and study sites the little washita 13 lw 13 in 1997 oklahoma everglades 2017 florida bondville bond in 1994 1997 and 2003 illinois and olney oln in 1998 and 2004 illinois sites were selected for testing the performance of this multi model assimilation approach fig 2 the in situ soil moisture data were collected during the southern great plains experiment sgp97 june 18th july 18th 1997 mohanty et al 2002 and international soil moisture network ismn for everglades bondville and olney https ismn geo tuwien ac at ismn the lw 13 site has the in situ soil moisture for 23 days at the soil depth of 0 5 cm while the daily soil moisture data were measured in the depth of soil 0 10 cm for the everglades site also the bondville and olney sites provide the measurements for 12 13 days at the soil depth of 0 10 cm the lw 13 loam everglades find sand bondville silt loam and olney silt loam sites have various soil characteristics with native grass cover daily weather datasets such as precipitation wind speed maximum and minimum temperature and solar radiation for the input parameters of hydrologic models were collected from the usda agricultural research service ars 136 for the lw 13 http ars mesonet org micronet weather station in oklahoma national centers for environmental information ncei https www1 ncdc noaa gov pub data uscrn products daily01 in florida and the illinois state water survey http www isws illinois edu warm in illinois the initial condition ic and bottom boundary conditions bbc at the lw 13 everglades bondville and olney sites were set as 100 cm from the soil surface obtained from ismn note that we tested the model performances with 100 150 and 200 cm of ic bbc from the soil surface and selected 100 cm which is closer to measurements of ic bbc at the lw 13 everglades sites because ic and bbc were unknown for validation of the multi model based soil moisture simulation approach the estimated soil water retention curves based on the mualem van genuchten parameters α n θ res θ sat ksat were compared with the observations note that the observed soil water retention curves were derived based on the collected soil core samples at the lw 13 site we tested our proposed multi model approach at the lw 13 1997 everglades 2017 bondville 1994 bondville 1997 and bondville 2003 and olney 1998 and olney 2004 sites but the clm model at the bondville and olney sites were excluded due to the lack of input variables furthermore uncertainties of the physical and optimization model structures in the multi model approach were analyzed furthermore the cross validation cv of multi model approach was tested at the everglades site with the daily soil moisture measurements in florida in the everglades site the rainfall amount of 255 3 mm was only generated in doy 7 151 while the period of doy 152 304 has the heavy rainfall 1 995 1 mm respectively thus the periods of doy 7 151 and doy 152 304 were defined as the dry and wet days then the cross validation of multi model approach was set as cv1 calibration for the dry days and validation for the wet days and cv2 validation for the dry days and calibration for the wet days respectively as ismn provides consistently the long term soil moisture measurements at the network of multiple locations in illinois we tested the transferability of our multi model approach using the dsst scheme at the bondville and olney sites under the contrasting weather conditions the framework of dsst scheme was shown in fig 3 for example the transfer 1 indicates that we calibrated the model parameters in 1994 and applied the calibrated values to a validation period 1997 the multiple set of weights for individual sites were estimated based on the land surface wetness conditions as shown in table 3 3 results and discussions 3 1 multi model soil moisture simulation approach we tested the multi model soil moisture simulation approach at the lw 13 site oklahoma in fig 4 overall the multi model outputs r 0 783 0 942 and rmse 0 019 0 032 were identifiable with the tdr measurements especially for clm integrated with ga r 0 926 and rmse 0 022 sce ua r 0 942 and rmse 0 026 and ia r 0 956 and rmse 0 027 fig 4g shows the comparison of measured and estimated water retention curves θ h based on the mualem van genuchten mvg parameters indicating the model performances of multi model approach although validations of the estimated physical model parameters for noah lsm and clm were excluded due to the lack of field scale measurements available the good agreement between the estimated and observed water retention curves with small uncertainties demonstrated the robustness of multi model approach based on parameterization scheme fig 4a c show variations in the estimated soil moisture dynamics due to the physical model structures based on individual optimizations ga sce ua or ia the swap and noah lsm models can capture well moisture conditions during the wet and normal days while clm performs well for the dry days also the soil moisture values estimated by noah lsm and swap were sharply changed based on the rainfall while clm was less sensitive although the clm model failed to reach to the maximum soil moisture value in doy 191 rainfall amount 42 8 mm clm showed the good performance under the normal and dry days during doy 172 to 190 fig 4d f shows the variations due to the optimization model structures based on individual hydrologic models swap noah lsm or clm overall variations due to the optimization model structures are relatively smaller than those of the physical models shown in fig 4a c fig 5 a f shows uncertainty ranges of the multi model outputs with all tdr twenty three measurements while fig 5g l indicates the multi model outputs with eleven measurements when we used less number of measurements the near surface soil moisture dynamics in the optimization fig 5g i and physical fig 5j l domains highly varied during the periods which have no in situ measurements noah lsm integrated with three different optimizations ia ga and sce ua had relatively less variations compared to those of swap and clm in the physical model domain also sce ua in the optimization domain had relatively less uncertainties in searching for the solutions fig 5l the model outputs in both the optimization and physical domains usually showed good agreements with the measurements during the simulation period at where the soil moisture data were measured in fig 5g l while uncertainties during the periods no measurements were highly increased these findings obviously showed that qualities of measurements the number of data available measuring intervals etc highly influence on performances of the multi model simulation approach comprising of optimizations adapting hydrologic models fig 6 showed the near surface soil moisture predictions in the optimization and physical domains at the bondville site illinois under different weather conditions we also tested the model performances based on the number of soil moisture measurements available fig 6a b showed the model outputs of individual swap and noah lsm integrated with the optimizations ia ga and sce ua during the whole period twelve measurements respectively swap based model outputs had relatively higher variations than those of noah lsm swap can perform well under the wet condition during the simulation period while noah lsm estimated the model outputs closer to the measurements for the dry conditions but when we used only the seven measurements during the initial period doy 91 210 swap showed high uncertainties in estimating the near surface soil moisture dynamics during doy 201 304 in fig 6c variations of noah lsm simulation outputs also increased but these uncertainties were relatively lower than those of swap as shown in fig 5 the number of soil moisture measurements influenced the ability of hydrologic models and optimization schemes in the model performances these findings indicated that the optimization schemes only fitted the model outputs closer to the in situ measurements during the simulation periods doy 170 197 for lw13 and doy 91 201 for bondville it might suggest that single model based soil moisture estimates with few in situ datasets which are not able to represent the whole simulation period have potential risks that can cause large uncertainties over under estimations these limitations may lead to wrong decisions in planning water resources management when we consider limited in situ soil moisture data in modeling alternatives for minimizing uncertainties need to be suggested figs 7 and 8 and table 4 showed the results of multi model approach for the cross validations at the everglades site in florida in cv1 the calibrated multi model outputs r 0 712 0 838 and rmse 0 016 0 033 integrated with ga sce ua and ia matched well with the daily in situ measurements in fig 7a c although the results of ia based models have small variations however the validation r 0 032 0 705 and rmse 0 029 0 074 results in the wet days cv1 were highly biased compared to the in situ measurements especially for the noah lsm model in doy 261 268 in cv2 the calibrated multi model outputs r 0 540 0 688 and rmse 0 031 0 035 during the wet days were comparable to the measurements with small uncertainties in fig 8 but the results during doy 267 274 were highly biased from the measured data the in situ soil moisture values were rapidly decreased right after the generations of high rainfall amounts of 377 4 doy 157 and 105 6 doy 237 mm while the decreasing of in situ soil moisture values since the rainfall generation of 205 7 mm in doy 253 were delayed only with the additional rainfall generations of 2 4 mm doy 254 256 we infer that the delayed decreasing curve of in situ soil moisture might be due to measuring errors in the field site the multi model outputs r 0 772 0 839 and rmse 0 019 0 049 for the dry validation days showed the overestimated trends compared to the in situ measurements these mean that the calibrated soil hydraulic properties during the wet period were also limited in predicting the soil moisture dynamics for the dry days these results of cross validation demonstrated that considering appropriate ranges of wet to dry conditions highly influence on the performance of optimizations and hydrological models based on parameterization scheme overall the multi models integrated with ga and sce ua performed well during the calibration for both cv 1 and cv 2 periods while the ia based multi model outputs showed small variations in figs 7 and 8 however the ga and sce ua based multi model outputs were highly biased from the in situ measurements during the validation periods in the contrast the ia based multi models consistently showed the good performances with small variations during both the calibration and validation periods in cv 1 and cv 2 it is inferred that the soil hydraulic properties overfitted by ga and sce ua to the in situ measurements during the calibration periods might cause bias in predicting the soil moisture dynamics for validation however the ia based multi models that have small variations indicating relatively less overfitted during the calibration periods showed the relatively better performances in predicting the soil moisture dynamics for validation these findings demonstrated that optimization model structures highly influence on the model performances of hydrological models as much as physical model structures based on different soil wetness conditions we tested our multi model approach at the lw 13 and bondville sites the arithmetic averaged aa and mwa for different soil wetness conditions based soil moisture dynamics during the calibration r 0 939 and rmse 0 012 for aa r 0 925 and rmse 0 013 for mwa and validation r 0 934 0 989 and rmse 0 021 0 040 for aa r 0 881 0 995 and rmse 0 014 0 023 for mwa periods at the lw 13 site are shown in fig 9 the aa based soil moisture of nine combination model outputs had more uncertainties compared to those conditioned by the mwa based on the soil wetness conditions although the correlation aa in the validation of doy 162 175 was slightly higher than that 0 881 of mwa these trends were similarly shown in the results of everglades and bondville sites the mwa based soil moisture values r 0 904 rmse 0 013 for calibration in doy 7 151 and r 0 589 rmse 0 051 for validation in doy 152 304 matched well with the in situ measurements compared to the results r 0 852 rmse 0 016 for calibration and r 0 520 rmse 0 048 for validation of aa in table 5 however the results of the aa r 0 689 and rmse 0 030 mwa r 0 686 and rmse 0 030 based approaches have no differences for calibration doy 152 304 under the wet period while the mwa based soil moisture r 0 866 and rmse 0 023 values were improved for validation compared to those r 0 857 and rmse 0 028 of aa these results might be inferred that the model performance of multi model approach under the wet condition doy 152 304 for calibration was influenced by bias errors including in situ measurements doy 267 274 also we tested our multi model based approach at the bondvill site in 1994 524 3 mm wet year 1997 388 7 mm dry year and 2003 469 1 mm normal year table 6 shows the statistics of aa and mwa based soil moisture dynamics with swap and noah lsm integrated with the optimizations ga ia and sce ua during the calibration period 1994 the aa of multi model outputs r 0 971 and rmse 0 034 showed good agreement with the measurements while the validation results r 0 878 and rmse 0 106 had more uncertainties the similar results were confirmed at the bondville and olney sites as shown in table 6 table 7 shows the weighted values of multi model outputs derived by the mwa scheme at the lw 13 and everglades sites under the wet normal and dry condition in the lw 13 site the ga based noah lsm has the highest weighted value 0 194 under the wet condition while the ia based swap 0 580 clm 0 277 models performed better under the normal and dry condition respectively however the higher weighted values were assigned to the sce ua based 0 173 for calibration in doy 7 151 and ia based 0 272 for calibration in doy 152 304 swap models for the wet condition at the everglades site also ga based clm 0 243 and ia based noah lsm 0 304 models have the relatively higher weighted values than the others during the normal days while the ia based clm 0 226 for calibration in doy 7 151 and 0 257 for calibration in doy 152 304 models still performed well for the dry condition overall the swap and noah lsm models showed the good performances under the wet and normal conditions while clm consistently demonstrated the ability that can respond well to the dry condition these weighted values for the lw 13 and everglades sites in table 7 supported the results in fig 4 and figs 7 8 furthermore the ia scheme integrated with swap noah lsm and clm usually have the relatively higher weighted values for the wet through dry conditions compared to those of sce ua and ga indicating that ia can contribute to the improvement of multi model approach under various wetness conditions overall our multi model approach improved the results compared to those of the arithmetic averages and their uncertainty ranges however these calibration and validation processes were conducted only under the identical weather conditions for each year separately it is still in question with respect to whether or not the estimated parameters can represent the field conditions for individual study sites under the contrasting weather conditions in the context of transferability 3 2 transferability of multi model approach in time we applied the estimated calibrated parameters during the wet year 1994 to other validation years in 1997 dry year and 2003 normal year to test the transferability of parameterization schemes in time at the bondville site fig 10 showed the aa and mwa based soil moisture projections in 1997 and 2003 the aa based soil moisture dynamics r 0 555 0 757 and rmse 0 050 0 073 in 1997 2003 in fig 10a c were highly biased compared to the in situ measurements the mwa based soil moisture values in fig 10d were better identifiable compared to those of the aa approach fig 10c while uncertainties of the mwa based outputs in fig 10b were slightly higher than those of aa approach fig 10a however the mwa based outputs during doy 101 121 191 211 were relatively closer to the measurements compared to those of the aa approach considering that the in situ soil moisture data were measured for every two weeks 14 days uncertainties that were not involved in calculating the statistics r and rmse during the unmeasured days might cause the relatively higher r and rmse than those of the mwa approach although the mwa based outputs also showed uncertainties our multi model approach based on the soil wetness conditions showed the good transferability of parameterization schemes in time we applied the estimated parameters during the dry and normal years in 1997 and 2003 respectively to the wet period 1994 as shown in fig 11 when we considered the transferability of model projections dry to wet years the projected soil moisture dynamics in 1994 based on the estimated soil parameters during the dry year 1997 had more uncertainties than those of the parameter estimates during the normal year 2003 we tested the transferability of our approach at the olney site illinois in 1998 precipitation 739 6 mm and 2004 precipitation 9 mm as shown in the above results our approach adapting the multiple weights based on the different soil wetness conditions could improve the model outputs compared to those of aa in fig 12 a b when we applied the estimated soil parameters during the dry period in 2004 to the normal year 1998 in the transfer 6 the averaged results r 0 754 and rmse 0 136 were highly biased compared to those of our proposed mwa approach with the improved statistics r 0 783 and rmse 0 136 in fig 12c d these model outputs failed to capture the high peaks of soil moisture these results in fig 12 showed critical weakness of parameterization approaches in transferability dry to wet years indicating that estimated optimized parameters of hydrologic model during dry years are not able to mimic soil moisture dynamics for wet years these findings might indicate that the performance of multi model approach is significantly dependent on selection of dry or wet days years in fig 13 we compared the water retention curves θ h using the estimated soil parameters α n θ res θ sat ksat during the calibration periods at the bondville and olney sites with the laboratory based references twenty nine soil textures from sand to clay shin and mohanty 2013 from the unsoda leij et al 1999 soil survey wösten et al 1994 and rosetta schaap et al 1999 database note that we only compared the local scale hydraulic parameters for swap because of the lack of field scale data available for noah lsm and clm the derived θ h curve for the dry year in 1997 trends closer to sand while θ h of the wet and normal years were relatively ranged in clay the curves for the olney site also showed the similar trends as shown in the results of bondville site when we considered that the θ h curves derived by the estimated soil parameters at the identical sites under the contrasting weather conditions it is evident that how different weather conditions considerably influence on the performance of parameterization schemes the differences between the θ h curves might account for the underestimated soil moisture dynamics thus estimated parameters during dry seasons could be limited in projecting soil moisture dynamics for wet periods based on these findings weather conditions need to be considered in estimating soil parameters for multi model simulation approaches thus our mwa approach with the consideration of weather conditions could improve parameterization schemes and minimize their drawbacks in modeling 4 conclusions in this study we developed a multi model based soil moisture simulation approach comprised of various hydrologic models swap noah lsm and clm and optimization schemes ga sce ua ia for better estimating the near surface 0 5 0 10 cm soil moisture dynamics and improving parameterization and their transferability under contrasting weather conditions soil moisture measurements at little washita lw 13 oklahoma everglades florida and bondville olney illinois sites were selected to evaluate our proposed approach the good agreement between the observed and estimated water retention curves demonstrated the robustness of the multi model soil moisture simulation approach at the lw 13 site although the results of swap integrated with ga sce ua and ia were only shown due to the lack of data for noah lsm and clm swap and noah lsm performed well during the wet and normal days in the model performance while the clm model outputs were identifiable with the tdr based soil moisture measurements during the dry days overall variations between the optimization model structures are relatively smaller than those of the physical models however uncertainties due to the physical and optimization model structures were highly increased when seasonal measurements were not representative during the study period especially optimization schemes only fit the simulated results where in situ measurements exist also we found that the overfitted parameters to the in situ measurements during the calibration period due to optimization model structures highly influence on the transferability of multi model approach although we confirmed that our proposed approach considerably improved the multi model outputs with the narrowed uncertainty ranges it indicated that qualities of measurements in modeling might cause large uncertainties during the periods of no measurement furthermore we confirmed that the results derived by our multi model approach adapting the weighting algorithm were more identifiable with the tdr measurements than those of the arithmetic averaging method in the test of transferability the comparisons of water retention curves θ h in the test of transferability under different weather conditions account for these uncertainties because the estimated parameters during the dry years were limited in representing the soil wetness conditions for the wet years overall we demonstrated how various factors i e uncertainties of physical and optimization model structures land surface wetness conditions selection of calibration and validation years qualities of measurements etc significantly influence the performance of multi model approach under various hydro climate regions credit

2304,accurate forecasting of rainfall is extremely important due to its complex nature and enormous impacts on hydrology floods droughts agriculture and monitoring of pollutant concentration levels in this study a new multi decomposition deep learning based technique was proposed to forecast monthly rainfall in himalayan region of india i e haridwar and nainital in the first stage the original rainfall signals as the individual accessible datasets were decomposed into intrinsic mode decomposition functions imfs through the time varying filter based empirical mode decomposition tvf emd technique and then the significant lagged values were computed from the decomposed sub sequences i e imfs using the partial autocorrelation function pacf in the second stage the pacf based decomposed imfs signals were again decomposed by the singular valued decomposition svd approach to reduce the dimensionality and enhance the forecasting accuracy the machine learning approaches including the bidirectional long short term memory reinforced with the encoder decoder bidirectional edbi lstm adaptive boosting regression adaboost generalized regression neural network grnn and random forest rf were used to construct the hybrid forecasting models also several statistical metrics i e correlation coefficient r root mean square error rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and graphical

models the outcomes of monthly rainfall forecasting ascertain that the tvf emd svd edbi lstm in the haridwar r 0 5870 rmse 118 4782 mm and nse 0 3116 and nainital r 0 9698 rmse 44 3963 mm nse 0 9388 outperformed the benchmarking models keywords rainfall forecasting edbi lstm empirical mode decomposition singular valued decomposition data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction increasing humanpopulation and industrialization have significant detrimental consequences onnatural resources ahmed et al 2021 furthermore natural calamities such as droughts floods storms and tsunamis have become more common in recent years malik et al 2020 yaseen and shahid 2020 hence the modeling of climate extremes requireprecise time series analysis ashwini et al 2021 halder et al 2021 rainfall is truly the only input element for the hydrological cycle but its scarcity or excesson earth on the other hand has an impact on massive flooding and severe droughts that occur at both long andshort periods patra et al 2012 zeleke and raes 1999 both long and short term rainfall forecastingis critical for the proper management ofwater resources and watershed sustainability alamgir et al 2020 mohsenipour et al 2020 yaseen et al 2019 for instance the extent ofrainfalldetermines the status ofgroundwater which can then deliver water at any time furthermore rainfall has a considerable impact on natural occurrences such as farming techniques rainfall prediction can help people to avoid numerous natural disasters and save lives prasetya and djamal 2019 rainfall forecasting accuracy can also aid in the creation of efficient structural and non structural solutions for disaster relief rainfall time series prediction accuracyis determined by the

frequently subject to substantial errors at the local scale on the other hand statistical models are easy to set up and use and they aremore effective for forecasting smooth variations in rainfall on a small scale zaw and naing 2008 as a result most scholars rely onstatistical models for local scalerainfall prediction time series models have also received adequate attention not just forhydrological tasks but also for several otherscience and engineering tasks hence this study is aimed at building reliable andresilient hybrid intelligence models that cansimulatethe current non linear pattern in rainfall by analysing the historical data and comprehending the time series data s fundamental mechanisms rainfall forecasting has received much attention to be simulated using advanced computer aid models including machine learning models ml adaryani et al 2022 diez sierra and del jesus 2020 the ml models are a well established tool that has been applied successfully in different engineering disciplines and particularly in climate and hydrology applications danandeh mehr et al 2018 fahimi et al 2017 omeje et al 2021 thamilselvan et al 2022 the main merit of those models are able to comprehend the input features with the targeted parameters without essential knowledge of the main feature characteristics herath et al 2020 over the years ml models with different versions have been applied for rainfall prediction and forecasting for example artificial neural networks ramirez et al 2005 recurrent artificial neural networks hong 2008 random forest yu et al 2017 support vector machine lu and wang 2011 fuzzy logic patel and parekh 2014 extreme learning machine dash et al 2018 logistic regression method moon et al 2019 genetic programming cramer et al 2017 and deep learning based models took a serious advancement on this perspective basha et al 2020 hernández et al 2016 salehin et al 2020 although multiple models have been explored for rainfall prediction yet shortage in those standalone models is still associated for example internal parameters tuning type of data used for simulating the rainfall degree of the nonlinearity and stochasticity researchers have started to explore new trends of research development to overcome the forgoing obstacles by using some advanced hybrid ml models diop et al 2020 pham et al 2020 yaseen et al 2019 data time series decomposition ali et al 2020 cross station simulation oleiwi et al 2018 application of radar spatial data prudden et al 2020 although the use ofml models and their many variants has been reported severally for rainfall prediction manystudies on rainfall predictionusingintegrative models have also been reportedbased on the use of feature selection and hybrid predictive models the combination of advanced tuning methods and the most recently researched version of a deep learning model resulted in a significant improvement in modeling various engineering problems till now rainfall process prediction using ahybrid encoder decoder bidirectional lstm model coupled with tvf emd based multi decomposition technique is not yet to be presented the primary purpose of this study is to see if a hybrid artificial intelligence ai model combined with a data processing methodcan be used efficientlyfor forecasting rainfall patterns on a monthly basis the suggested model combines a new multi composition technique comprised of the tvf emd and svd combination coupled with the edbi lstm approach making it a unique integrative computer aid model based on advanced learning and climate dataset analysis for improved forecastingaccuracy it is also believed that the proposed hybrid ai model can capture the deepening of monthly rainfall patterns at haridwar and nainital locationsinuttarakhand state of india besides the other advanced ml approaches i e adaboost rf and grnn were examined to evaluate the robustness of the edbi lstm in both hybrid and standalone counterpart states the developed model in the end can be considered an alternative strategy for simulating the climatological processes based on the potential of hybridized aimodels optimized with nature inspired algorithms 2 theoretical overviews 2 1 introducing study area and datasets description fig 1 demonstrates the location map of the study area along with the two selected stations namely haridwar and nainital for monthly rainfall forecasting using advanced machine learning paradigms these stations are positioned in the uttarakhand state of india which has an area of 53812 47 km2 with a varying altitude of 145 m to 7796 m above the mean sea level malik and kumar 2021 2020 the high altitude 4572 areas of uttarakhand are cold over the year and not reachable because of heavy rainfall nandargi et al 2016 the average annual rainfall varies between 206 and 3955 mm and is mostly received 60 85 during the rainy season june to september malik et al 2021a the temperature is distributed from sub zero to 43 c in the summer season april to june and 0 15 c in the winter season october to february of the uttarakhand state nandargi et al 2016 table 1 provides information about the latitude longitude elevation and data duration of the haridwar and nainital stations the monthly rainfall time series data for 55 years 1961 2015 was obtained from imd india meteorological department pune it was separated into training 495 datasets and testing 165 datasets phases table 2 outlines the statistical properties of training and testing datasets in training the cv coefficient of variation was 154 6 and 136 8 and in testing the cv was 144 4 and 136 1 at haridwar and nainital stations it indicates the robustness of the data and is suitable for analysis 2 2 time varying filter based empirical mode decomposition tvf emd the idea of the time varying filter based empirical mode decomposition tvf emd approach was given by li et al 2017 for handling the end effect and mode mixing problem within empirical mode decomposition emd and achieving the shifting process through a time varying filter the bandwidth threshold and b spline order are the main constraints that need to be selected properly for the application of the tvf emd technique li et al 2017 if these constraints are inappropriate then the tvf emd model fails to optimize the mode mixing problem likewise for performing time varying filtering need to find out the local cut off frequency zhang et al 2021c moreover the tvf emd approach yields more practicable results than the decomposition techniques wang et al 2020 zhang et al 2021c a time varying filter is used to complete the shifting process of tvf emd and its implementation involves the following steps li et al 2017 song et al 2021b step 1 employ a b spline approximation to compute the local cut off frequency which can be described as 1 g m n t k c k β n t m k here β n t b spline function and c k b spline coefficient the b spline function is enlarged by a factor of m the approximation result is determined by n m and c k thus for given b spline order n and knots m b spline approximation is to determine the c k that reduces the approximation error ε m 2 and computed as 2 ε m 2 t x t c m b m n t 2 in which b m n t β n t m m up sampling operation by m and convolution operator and the solution of c k is 3 c k p m n x m k where m down sampling operation by m and p m n pre filter thus we can write eq 1 as 4 g m n t p m n x m b m n t in the above equation the used b spline approximation is a special form of low pass filtering thus the local cut off frequency is projected from the input signal and employed to create the tvf this process is carried out to obtain the local cut off frequency φ bis t φ 1 t φ 2 t 2 here φ 1 t and φ 2 t are slow varying components realign the φ bis t to solve the issue of intermittence i e noise and obtain the final local cut off frequency by interpolating among the peaks or remainders step 2 filtering of the input signal using a time varying filter i e b spline approximation filter to achieve the local mean step 3 check whether the residual signal encounters the stopping conditions or improves the stopping criteria as follows wang et al 2020 5 θ t b loughlin t φ avg t in which b loughlin t and φ avg t represents the loughlin instantaneous bandwidth and weighted average instantaneous frequency of separate components the present study utilized tvf emd for monthly rainfall forecasting on haridwar and nainital sites comprehensive information on the tvf emd model readers can obtain from li et al 2017 and zhang et al 2018 for the emd model readers can obtain from li et al 2017 and zhang et al 2018 2 3 singular valued decomposition svd the svd is a matrix based data decomposition technique and is usually employed in statistical and machine learning fields bretherton et al 1992 it has been used for extracting the faint signal and proved to be robust in estimating the missing values from real world data cong et al 2013 the objective of the svd algorithm is to find u v and w matrices for any m n particular input data in the form of matrix a is divided into a u ω v t where u m m and orthonormal matrix ω m n and diagonal matrix and v n n and orthonormal matrix prasad et al 2020 the w is the singular values of a the matrix ω contains singular values σ i where σ 1 σ 2 σ n 0 the truncated singular value decomposition for 1 r n is written as mardani et al 2020 6 a k u d i a g σ 1 σ k 0 0 n k v t in the svd the a k of rank k can be found as 7 a k min x r a n k x k a x f where f is frobenius norm and defined as a f i 1 m j 1 n a ij 2 2 4 partial autocorrelation function the selection of the optimal input features is one of the most important step in the construction of robust and reliable forecasting models this research utilized a partial autocorrelation function pacf as a feature selection tool for nominating the significant input or lags from monthly rainfall time series at 5 confidence interval upper and lower bounds mathematical pacf is expressed as hadi et al 2019 malik et al 2021d 8 pacf k k acf j 1 k 1 pacf k 1 j acf k 1 1 j 1 k 1 pacf k 1 j acf k 1 in which acf represents the autocorrelation function acf and is computed as ac f k t 1 n k x t x x t k x t 1 n x t x here x t defines the value of the variable at time t x t k describes the value of the variable at time t k furthermore k denotes the lag number with series x t x indicates the mean of the whole rainfall data series and n outlines the number of observations 2 5 encoder decoder bidirectional lstm edbi lstm cho et al 2014 proposed the concept of encoder decoder bidirectional long short term memory edbi lstm to diagnose models on different input and output time stages fig 2 illustrates the typical structure of the edbi lstm model which include the principles of the simple lstm bidirectional lstm and encoder decoder sequence the simple lstm is an advanced version of a recurrent neural network rnn and learns the system based on chronological data hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 the lstm model gained popularity in different fields across the world feng et al 2020 ferreira and da cunha 2020 kim and kim 2020 li et al 2022 livieris et al 2020 seng et al 2021 xiang et al 2020 yin et al 2020 the basic network of the lstm model includes the forget gate input gate and output gate see fig 2 a the flow of information inside the memory block the information stored in a cell and the output streams of the cell into the rest of the networks are controlled through these gates zhang et al 2021c the output from these gates is expressed as livieris et al 2020 yin et al 2020 9 f t σ w f h t 1 x t b f 10 i t σ w i h t 1 x t b i 11 c t t a n h w c

the weights matrix and bias vectors of f t i t c t and o t respectively c t 1 represents the old memory cell unit at t 1 time and h t 1 outlines the output of the hidden state at t 1 time the tanh hyperbolic 1 1 softsign and rlu rectified linear unit state the activation function of c t o t and h t units after that bidirectional lstm model was constructed to handle the gradient explosion and information morphing drawbacks during the backpropagation of lstm graves and schmidhuber 2005 hu and zhang 2018 again the predictive efficacy of bidirectional lstm was improved through encoder decoder sequences the edbi lstm model is capable to process the natural language and can also read create a sequence of arbitrary length kurata et al 2016 additionally the edbi lstm model works in a symbiotic manner and the input sequential data is trained by the rnn encoder decoder networks to generate the mapped output sequence recently this model gained popularity in different domains because of its high predictive accuracy fan et al 2019 karbasi et al 2022a 2022b park et al 2018 wang and zhang 2018 therefore the present study explored the viability of the edbi lstm model in monthly rainfall forecasting at haridwar and nainital locations the edbi lstm model includes two different parts i one for the interpretation of the input information of the sequence and encoding the fixed length vector and ii a second for decoding the vector and outputting the forecasted sequence the cell state stores the output of the encoded lstm on m time steps and supply the same as input to the decoder lstm on n time steps fu et al 2021 accordingly it can be stated that in each update the decoder feeds the model so that the output from the preceding update is considered as the input of the recent update because this sequence to sequence network solves the time step issue bian et al 2020 xiang et al 2020 zhang et al 2021a 2 6 generalized regression neural network grnn the grnn is a type of radial basis function rbf used to classify and control the nonlinear systems specht 1991 the basic structure of the grnn model comprises with input pattern summation and output layers see fig 2 b the output of the model is calculated based on the maximum probability principle cai et al 2021 the optimal parameters of the grnn model were obtained during the forward propagation step the input layer is connected to the pattern layer and defines a training pattern the output of the pattern layer is supplied to the summation layer which involves only two neurons namely s summation first and d summation second the final output of the grnn model is obtained as ding et al 2019 specht 1991 15 y x i 1 n y i e x p d i 2 2 σ 2 i 1 n e x p d i 2 2 σ 2 where y is the estimated output y i denotes the output of the input sample e x p d i 2 2 σ 2 represents the activation function d i 2 defines the euclidean distance from x and computed as d i 2 x x i t x x i where x is the input sample x i is training sample and t state matrix transpose here the grnn model is discussed in brief for more information refers to specht 1991 2 7 random forest rf the rf technique is a classification and regression technique that entails the construction of a series of tree predictors each of which is created using a random vector independent from the input vector in regression the tree predictor uses numerical values rather than the class labels from the random forest classifier breiman 1999 random forest is a collection of cart model trees that have been proposed to improve its performance these trees are constructed from the set of input vectors using the bootstrap sampling method thus the selected input of all of them follows the same distribution despite their unique and independent structure the tree sets have a high correlation with each other which together with their strength and a large number causes the convergence of the model error also the mentioned features along with estimating the internal error of the model increase its ability to check more features and select the most effective parameters in this tree network the pruning process is not performed so the model error is limited to avoid over fitting the model the following are the steps in the rf method breiman 2001 i from the original dataset x different bootstrap samples x i i bootstrap iteration are randomly selected two thirds of the samples are bootstrapped while the remaining one third are out of bag samples each tree is designed in such a way that it corresponds to a subset of the bootstrap ii at each node in the tree a new split is chosen at random from all indices and the regression tree s splitting criterion is the input variable with the lowest mean square error mse iii the data splitting procedure is repeated in each internal node until all randomized trees are created and a stop condition is achieved iv the following are the final regression results where b represents the total number of trees in the forest and t b signifies each tree 16 y x i 1 b b 1 b t b x i 2 8 adaptive boosting regression adaboost adaboost an abbreviation for adaptive boosting is a type of boosting algorithm proposed in 1997 by freund and schapire 1997 this approach first establishes an initial distribution on a training set then repeats the process using adaptive weights to attain a stopping condition over the training set one of the algorithm s key concepts is to preserve a weight distribution training samples are weighted based on a classifiers after it has been developed the reweighted training samples are then used to build the next classifier to sum it up when training is complete the individual classifiers are merged to form a final highly accurate classifier a weight is maintained for each individual occurrence and the more weight an individual instance has the greater weight that individual instance has on the classifier that is trained pedregosa et al 2011 the

learning methods have been developed with the aim of solving the engineering problems related to the forecasting of time series which according to their potential can lead to more accurate and better results than other classical methods of ml karbasi et al 2022b 2022a in simulating highly non linear problems such as rainfall even deep learning methods such as the edbi lstm in individual form are not able to achieve proper accuracy in this research to overcome those drawbacks the edbi lstm scheme is integrated with powerful signal decomposition methods and other efficient pre processing techniques the tvf emd method by eliminating the shortcomings of the emd scheme in hybridization with a edbi lstm algorithm has a significant ability to solve highly non linear problems also the results can show that applying a dimensionality reduction method such as the svd method can be effective in reducing the cost of calculations and increasing accuracy combining the benefits of each part of the hybrid model presented in this study has made it possible to get promising results to forecast the monthly rainfall in india s different climate zones the proposed hybrid ai models i e tvf emd svd rf tvf emd svd edbi lstm tvf emd svd adaboost and tvf emd svd grnn have been developed on a pc with an intel core i7 intell r cpu 3 4 ghz and 8 gb of memory the open source python libraries keras arnold 2017 and tensorflow abadi 2016 were used to construct the edbi lstm and scikit learn library was employed for the adaboost development also the rf grnn tvf emd svd and pacf approaches were adopted in the matlab 2018a environment the schematic flowchart of the monthly forecasting rainfall using the developed hybrid ai models is illustrated in fig 4 the comprehensive details of constructing the hybrid ai models are described in the following steps 4 step 1 significant time lagged inputs extraction one of the most critical steps in constructing the forecasting models is to determine the antecedent information and the lagged time of the considered time series there are various techniques for lags determination such as pacf and types of feature selection methods which pacf is taken into account as the most common tool in the literature fig 5 illustrates the graphical representation of the acf and pacf of both rainfall signals of haridwar and nainital stations to determine the significant antecedent information lags to apply on decomposed components as can be seen from fig 5 in both stations the rainfall t 1 rainfall t 2 and rainfall t 3 are candidate for applying in models development although the lagged times of 6 7 8 and 9 could be influential in the modeling by furthermore assessments the authors ascertained that their effect is negative on the accuracy of the models on both stations so it is ignored and confined to the first three lags 5 step 2 first phase of signals decomposition tvf emd the main aim of using the pre processing tvf emd technique was its ability on mitigate mode mixing of the nonstationary rainfall signals and seek the amplitude modulation of the noisy modes which are yielded by the random distribution of extrema song 2021 song et al 2021a the tvf emd instead of the classical emd scheme can handle the impact of noisy signals during the envelope construction step of decomposition techniques for this purpose various intrinsic mode functions imfs were examined by trial and error procedure and 5 sub sequences 4 imfs and one residual were picked as the optimal imfs fig 6 demonstrates the decomposed sub sequences in each site of the study as the default values the b spline order and stopping criterion were considered equal to 26 and 0 1 respectively for both sites in this regard for each site 3 lags antecedent candidate input extracted from the pacf were typically decomposed and 15 sub sequences 5 imfs multiplied by 3 lags were obtained from the first preprocessing stage the other setting parameters of the tvf emd pre processing technique such as b spline order end flag and stopping criterion are specified in table 3 6 step 3 second phase of decomposition svd the most important goal of the second decomposition stage is dimensionality reduction and increases the accuracy of rainfall forecasting here the sub sequences i e imfs and the residual created by the tvf emd decomposition technique are used to further decompose by the svd model considering a predefined 40 dimensionality reduction fig 7 describes the reduction of the candidate input matrix by using the svd decomposition scheme with number of singular vectors 9 the predefined adjustment parameters of the svd model such as the number of singular vectors number of iterations block size and setting mean center criterion are given in table 3 besides the numbers of training and testing datasets after imposing the lags are mentioned in table 3 7 step 4 models feeding and configuration as mentioned before the duration of modeling was from 1961 to 2015 the most common data allocating approach for the training and testing datasets in time series based engineering problems is ordinary direct dividing datasets into sub sets prasad et al 2020 quilty and adamowski 2018 for this aim 75 of whole dataset 41 years was used for training the models and the rest 25 dataset 14 years was employed for testing of the models besides prior splitting the datasets all the data sets for the hybrid and standalone ai models were normalized between 0 and 1 to enhance the stability and convergence as the following formulation 29 r f rf r f min r f max r f min where r f is the normalized rainfall value and rf is the real time rainfall value moreover rf m i n and rf m a x are the minimum and maximum values of rainfall respectively 7 1 setting of machine learning approaches basically the choice of regulatory parameters for the ai model has a significant impact on improving the forecasting results to achieve this goal meta heuristic algorithms random search and grid search strategies are often used in this research the grid search method was used to optimize the parameters of the models table 4 lists all the optimized hyper parameters of utilized ai methods in rainfall simulation the important hyper parameters ofthe edbi lstm model are the number of layers neuron number learning rate epoch value training algorithm and activation operator zhang et al 2021b whereas the significant setting parameters of the adaboost approach jamei et al 2021 are learning rate n estimators and loss function it is noteworthy that the rf and grnn hyper parameters are tree number maximum number of features and spread value respectively 8 application results and analysis in this study the proposed hybrid i e tvf emd svd edbi lstm tvf emd svd rf tvf emd svd adaboost tvf emd svd grnn and the standalone i e lstm rf adaboost and grnn ai models were assessed based on r rmse mae nse kge and ia indicators to forecast monthly rainfall at haridwar and nainital stations table 5 highlighted the performance of the proposed hybrid tvf emd svd edbi lstm model against the other benchmark comparison models on haridwar station during training and testing periods based on r rmse mae nse kge and ia values the hybrid tvf emd svd edbi lstm model achieved the highest values of r 0 9688 nse 0 9383 kge 0 9422 ia 0 9836 and lowest error magnitudes for rmse 35 4671 mm mae 25 1577 mm followed by the hybrid tvf emd svd rf tvf emd svd adaboost and tvf emd svd grnn models in the testing period on the hand the accuracy of standalone models was relatively poor in relation to the hybrid models also it was found that the lstm model in the testing period with r 0 5870 rmse 118 4782 mm mae 72 4846 mm nse 0 3116 kge 0 3927 and ia 0 7000 appears to be better than the rf adaboost and grnn models overall the hybrid tvf emd svd edbi lstm model outperformed in both the training and testing scenarios against other comparing ai models to forecast the monthly rainfall at haridwar table 6 showing the accuracy of newly developed ai models i e hybrid version and standalone at nainital station to forecast monthly rainfall the hybrid tvf emd svd edbi lstm model again appears to be the most accurate to forecast monthly rainfall based on the adopted assessment metrics for example these metrics in the testing period are r 0 9698 rmse 44 3963 mm mae 28 5545 mm nse 0 9388 kge 0 9614 ia 0 9846 best for tvf emd svd edbi lstm model as compared to tvf emd svd rf tvf emd svd adaboost tvf emd svd grnn lstm rf adaboost and grnn models to forecast monthly rainfall on nainital fig 8 ranks the proposed hybrid tvf emd svd edbi lstm tvf emd svd rf tvf emd svd adaboost tvf emd svd grnn and the standalone lstm rf adaboost and grnn models based on r nse kge and ia the analysis undoubtedly proved that the hybrid models are ranked higher than the standalone counterpart models by achieving higher values of the r nse kge and ia for the haridwar and nainital sites but the tvf emd svd edbi lstm ranked at the top ranked 1 exhibited higher magnitudes of the r nse kge and ia metrics in both the candidate sites haridwar and nainital the tvf emd svd rf model ranked on 2nd position followed by tvf emd svd adaboost tvf emd svd grnn rf edbi lstm adaboost and grnn models for both locations the tvf emd svd edbi lstm model showpromising accuracy based on the r nse kge and ia values for both sites against the other comparing ai models fig 8 fig 9 exposes the relationship between the monthly forecasted and measured rainfall mm of the tvf emd svd edbi lstm tvf emd svd rf tvf emd svd adaboost tvf emd svd grnn lstm rf adaboost and grnn models in terms of scatter plots along with r and rmse for haridwar and nainital sites to assess the comparison of the models for haridwar site the tvf emd svd edbi lstm model had r 0 9688 rmse 35 4671 mm while tvf emd svd rf tvf emd svd adaboost and tvf emd svd grnn models had r 0 9475 0 9425 0 9399 and rmse 48 1584 mm 53 6252 mm 51 5689 mm this comparison indicates the better performance of the tvf emd svd edbi lstm model than the other hybrid models in forecasting the monthly rainfall in addition he standalone lstm rf adaboost and grnn models perform poorly to forecast monthly rainfall at haridwar similarly the tvf emd svd edbi lstm model was excellent in forecasting monthly rainfall at nainital site followed by tvf emd svd rf tvf emd svd grnn and tvf emd svd adaboost while again the standalone counterpart models were found to be very poor thus fig 9 established that the tvf emd svd edbi lstm model was better in forecasting monthly rainfall for both sites fig 10 shows the taylor diagram of referenced measured and forecasted rainfall for haridwar and nainital sites using the tvf emd svd edbi lstm tvf emd svd rf tvf emd svd adaboost tvf emd svd grnn lstm rf adaboost and grnn models taylor diagram taylor 2001 is basically based on standard deviation rmse and coefficient of correlation in a polar coordinate system to portrays how far lies the forecasting models from the referenced measured rainfall a model with a minimum value of standard deviation rmse and maximum value of r is believed to be the best an alternative approach to determine the model precision is if the forecasted rainfall is closer to the measured rainfall is indicated as the best model fig 10 clearly shows that the tvf emd svd edbi lstm model was close to the measured referenced rainfall for both sites followed by tvf emd svd rf tvf emd svd adaboost and tvf emd svd grnn models the standalone model s i e the lstm rf adaboost and grrn lies far away from the measured rainfall depicting poor accuracy fig 11 reveals the residuals between the forecasted and measured rainfall in violin plots of the tvf emd svd edbi lstm tvf emd svd rf tvf emd svd adaboost and tvf emd svd grnn models at haridwar and nainital sites the tvf emd svd edbi lstm model generates the lowest residual in violin plot distributions confirming that the errors were very small between the forecasted and measured rainfall with iqr 35 03 for haridwar and iqr 37 33 for nainital respectively fig 12 demonstrates the comparison between the measured rainfall against the forecasted rainfall generated by the hybrid version of the tvf emd svd edbi lstm tvf emd svd rf tvf emd svd grnn and tvf emd svd adaboost left models along with their violin plots distribution right by analyzing the tvf emd svd edbi lstm model seemed to be the most precise in forecasting the rainfall which exactly follows the pattern and stability corresponding to the measured rainfall with their same violin distribution generation of the monthly rainfall for haridwar and nainital sites this can be easily seen from fig 12 where the comparing benchmark models i e the tvf emd svd rf tvf emd svd grnn and tvf emd svd adaboost yield lower accuracy in terms of time series plots for forecasted versus measured rainfall with distinct violin distribution sizes which confirms respectively large fluctuations and spikes overall the tvf emd svd edbi lstm model achieves better accuracy against comparing ai hybrid models for haridwar and nainital sites a clear distinction of comparison of the hybrid tvf emd svd edbi lstm model was established using the boxplots fig 13 in combination with the relative deviation metrics i e q25 inter quartile range iqr q75 and mean demonstrates that the distribution of forecasted rainfall generated from benchmarking hybrid ai models i e tvf emd svd rf tvf emd svd grnn and tvf emd svd adaboost for haridwar and nainital sites were fairly scattered registering some outliers yet the box plot distribution of the hybrid tvf emd svd edbi lstm model has a very accurate interpretation for both stations based on q25 iqr q75 and mean values in fig 13 thus the boxplots for both sites ascertain the excellent forecasting accuracy of the hybridized tvf emd svd edbi lstm model the empirical cumulative distribution function ecdf of the forecasted monthly rainfall by the tvf emd svd edbi lstm versus tvf emd svd rf tvf emd svd grnn and tvf emd svd adaboost models are plotted in fig 14 for haridwar and nainital the ecdf of the tvf emd svd edbi lstm model displayed a very close profile against the benchmark hybrid comparing ai models which further establishes better precision of the tvf emd svd edbi lstm model in forecasting monthly rainfall the scope of this work can be widen using the satellite derived input predictors to improve the forecasting capability of the tvf emd svd edbi lstm model in addition the synoptic scale climate mode indices are extremely influencing rainfall patterns and the employment of these indices can suggest a more detail study in parallel with the integration with federated learning yaseen 2022 the hybridization of deep learning with numerical weather prediction nwp models can offer a new emerging area in this field of the research further the scope can be enhanced by implementing the ensemble strategies with uncertainty assessment the multi decomposition tvf emd svd edbi lstm modelling framework can potentially be employed in other sectors of interest such as air quality monitoring systems agriculture crops droughts hydrology and renewable and sustainable energy areas under climate change scenarios in a nutshell it is established that the multi decomposition tvf emd svd edbi lstm modelling framework can be helpful for water resources management extreme rainfall events droughts and hydrology 9 conclusion and remarks this research assesses how to provide a robust and efficient model to accurately forecast the monthly rainfall with the nonstationary signal using a double decomposition scheme and advanced machine learning models to achieve this goal a novel tvf emd based multi decomposition modelling framework was designed to forecast monthly rainfall the proposed multi decomposition modelling framework was based on the tvf emd which is integrated with svd and encoder decoder bidirectional lstm i e tvf emd svd edbi lstm for monthly rainfall forecasting on haridwar and nainital sites india furthermore for comparison purposes three advanced data driven models including the rf adaboost and grrn were coupled to construct the hybrid ai models i e tvf emd svd rf tvf emd svd grnn and tvf emd svd adaboost the original signals of monthly rainfall were decomposed into several imfs using the tvf emd technique to overcome the non stationarity and non linearity issues further the svd algorithm was introduced to reduce the dimensionality of imfs signals which can convert the signals imfs into a more stable and linear form finally the svd based signals were then supplied as inputs into the encoder decoder bidirectional lstm to design the tvf emd svd edbi lstm model for monthly rainfall forecasting likewise the rf adaboost and grrn models were also assessed to compare each model in hybrid and standalone versions the robustness of the models was examined based on goodness of fit metrics i e r rmse mae nse kge and ia and various graphical interpretation tools the tvf emd svd edbi lstm model was appeared to be the most accurate by achieving the most precise values in terms of r 0 5870 rmse 118 4782 mm mae 72 4846 mm nse 0 3116 kge 0 3927 and ia 0 7000 for haridwar site similarly these metrics are accurate for nainital site with r 0 9698 rmse 44 3963 mm mae 28 5545 mm nse 0 9388 kge 0 9614 and ia 0 9846 to forecast monthly

floods storms and tsunamis have become more common in recent years malik et al 2020 yaseen and shahid 2020 hence the modeling of climate extremes requireprecise time series analysis ashwini et al 2021 halder et al 2021 rainfall is truly the only input element for the hydrological cycle but its scarcity or excesson earth on the other hand has an impact on massive flooding and severe droughts that occur at both long andshort periods patra et al 2012 zeleke and raes 1999 both long and short term rainfall forecastingis critical for the proper management ofwater resources and watershed sustainability alamgir et al 2020 mohsenipour et al 2020 yaseen et al 2019 for instance the extent ofrainfalldetermines the status ofgroundwater which can then deliver water at any time furthermore rainfall has a considerable impact on natural occurrences such as farming techniques rainfall prediction can help people to avoid numerous natural disasters and save lives prasetya and djamal 2019 rainfall forecasting accuracy can also aid in the creation of efficient structural and non structural solutions for disaster relief rainfall time series prediction accuracyis determined by the

frequently subject to substantial errors at the local scale on the other hand statistical models are easy to set up and use and they aremore effective for forecasting smooth variations in rainfall on a small scale zaw and naing 2008 as a result most scholars rely onstatistical models for local scalerainfall prediction time series models have also received adequate attention not just

linear pattern in rainfall by analysing the historical data and comprehending the time series data s fundamental mechanisms rainfall forecasting has received much attention to be simulated using advanced computer aid models including machine learning models ml adaryani et al 2022 diez sierra and del jesus 2020 the ml models are a well established tool that has been applied successfully in different engineering disciplines and particularly in climate and hydrology applications danandeh mehr et al 2018 fahimi et al 2017 omeje et al 2021 thamilselvan et al 2022 the main merit of those

deep learning based models took a serious advancement on this perspective basha et al 2020 hernández et al 2016 salehin et al 2020 although multiple models have been explored for rainfall prediction yet shortage in those standalone models is still associated for example internal parameters tuning type of data used for simulating the rainfall degree of the nonlinearity and stochasticity researchers have started to explore new trends of research development to overcome the forgoing obstacles by using some advanced hybrid ml models diop et al 2020 pham et al 2020 yaseen et al 2019 data time series decomposition ali et al 2020 cross station simulation oleiwi et al 2018 application of radar spatial data prudden et al 2020 although the use ofml models and their many variants has been reported severally for rainfall prediction manystudies on rainfall predictionusingintegrative models have also been reportedbased on the use of feature selection and hybrid predictive models the combination of advanced tuning methods and the most recently researched version of a deep learning model resulted in a significant improvement in modeling various engineering problems till now rainfall process prediction using ahybrid encoder decoder bidirectional lstm model coupled with tvf emd based multi decomposition technique is not yet to be presented the primary purpose of this study is to see if a hybrid artificial intelligence ai model combined with a data processing methodcan be used efficientlyfor forecasting rainfall patterns on a monthly basis the suggested model combines a new multi composition technique comprised of the tvf emd and svd combination coupled with the edbi lstm approach making it a unique integrative computer aid model based on advanced learning and climate dataset analysis for improved forecastingaccuracy it is also believed that the proposed hybrid ai model can capture the deepening of monthly rainfall patterns at haridwar and nainital locationsinuttarakhand state of india besides the other advanced ml approaches i e adaboost rf and grnn were examined to evaluate the robustness of the edbi lstm in both hybrid and standalone

haridwar and nainital for monthly rainfall forecasting using advanced machine learning paradigms these stations are positioned in the uttarakhand state of india which has an area of 53812 47 km2 with a varying altitude of 145 m to 7796 m above the mean sea level malik and kumar 2021 2020 the high altitude 4572 areas of uttarakhand are cold over the year and not reachable because of heavy rainfall nandargi et al 2016 the average annual rainfall varies between 206 and 3955 mm and is mostly received 60 85 during the rainy season june to september malik et al 2021a the temperature is distributed from sub zero to 43 c in the summer season april to june and 0 15 c in the winter season october to february of the uttarakhand state nandargi et al 2016 table 1 provides information about the latitude longitude elevation and data duration of the haridwar and nainital stations the monthly rainfall time series data for 55 years 1961 2015 was obtained from imd india meteorological department pune it was separated into training 495 datasets and testing 165 datasets phases table 2 outlines the statistical properties of training and testing datasets in training the cv coefficient of variation was 154 6 and 136 8 and in testing the cv was 144 4 and 136 1 at haridwar and nainital stations it indicates the robustness of the data and is suitable for analysis 2 2 time varying filter based empirical mode decomposition tvf emd the idea of the time varying filter based empirical mode decomposition tvf emd approach was given by li et al 2017 for handling the end effect and mode mixing problem within empirical mode decomposition emd and achieving the shifting process through a time varying filter the bandwidth threshold and b spline order are the main constraints that need to be selected properly for the application of the tvf emd technique li et al 2017 if these constraints are inappropriate then the tvf emd model fails to optimize the mode mixing problem likewise for performing time varying filtering need to find out the local cut off frequency zhang et al 2021c moreover the tvf emd approach yields more practicable results than the decomposition techniques wang et al 2020 zhang et al 2021c a time varying filter is used to complete the shifting process of tvf emd and its implementation involves the following steps li et al 2017 song et al 2021b step 1 employ a b spline approximation to compute the local cut off frequency which can be described as 1 g m n t k c k β n t m k here β n t b spline function and c k b spline coefficient the b spline function is enlarged by a factor of m the approximation result is determined by n m and c k thus for given b spline order n and knots m b spline approximation is to determine the c k that reduces the approximation error ε m 2 and computed as 2 ε m 2 t x t c m b m n t 2 in which b m n t β n t m m up sampling operation by m and convolution operator and the solution of c k is 3 c k p m n x m k where m down sampling operation by m and p m n pre filter thus we can write eq 1 as 4 g m n t p m n x m b m n t in the above equation the used b spline approximation is a special form of low pass filtering thus the local cut off frequency is projected from the input signal and employed to create the tvf this process is carried out to obtain the local cut off frequency φ bis t φ 1 t φ 2 t 2 here φ 1 t and φ 2 t are slow varying components realign the φ bis t to solve the issue of intermittence i e noise and obtain the final local cut off frequency by interpolating among the peaks or remainders step 2 filtering of the input signal using a time varying filter i e b spline approximation filter to achieve the local mean step 3 check whether the residual signal encounters the stopping conditions or improves the stopping criteria as follows wang et al 2020 5 θ t b loughlin t φ avg t in which b loughlin t and φ avg t represents the loughlin instantaneous bandwidth and weighted average instantaneous frequency of separate components the present study utilized tvf emd for monthly rainfall forecasting on haridwar and nainital sites comprehensive information on the tvf emd model readers can obtain from li et al 2017 and zhang et al 2018 for the emd model readers can obtain from li et al 2017 and zhang et al 2018 2 3 singular valued decomposition svd the svd is a matrix based data decomposition technique and is usually employed in statistical and machine learning fields bretherton et al 1992 it has been used for extracting the faint signal and proved to be robust in estimating the missing values from real world data cong et al 2013 the objective of the svd algorithm is to find u v and w matrices for any m n particular input data in the form of matrix a is divided into a u ω

construction of robust and reliable forecasting models this research utilized a partial autocorrelation function pacf as a feature selection tool for nominating the significant input or lags from monthly rainfall time series at 5 confidence interval upper and lower bounds mathematical pacf is expressed as hadi et al 2019 malik et al 2021d 8 pacf k k acf j 1 k 1 pacf k 1 j acf k 1 1 j 1 k 1

5 encoder decoder bidirectional lstm edbi lstm cho et al 2014 proposed the concept of encoder decoder bidirectional long short term memory edbi lstm to diagnose models on different input and output time stages fig 2 illustrates the typical structure of the edbi lstm model which include the principles of the simple lstm bidirectional lstm and encoder decoder sequence the simple lstm is an advanced version of a recurrent neural network rnn and learns the system based on chronological data hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 the lstm model gained popularity in different fields across the world feng et al 2020 ferreira and da cunha 2020 kim and kim 2020 li et al 2022 livieris et al 2020 seng et al 2021 xiang et al 2020 yin et al 2020 the basic network of the lstm model includes the forget gate input gate and output gate see fig 2 a the flow of information inside the memory block the information stored in a cell and the output streams of the cell into the rest of the networks are controlled through these gates zhang et al 2021c the output from these gates is expressed as livieris et al 2020 yin et al 2020 9 f t σ w f h t 1 x t b f 10 i t σ w i h t 1 x t b i 11 c t t a n h w c

information morphing drawbacks during the backpropagation of lstm graves and schmidhuber 2005 hu and zhang 2018 again the predictive efficacy of bidirectional lstm was improved through encoder decoder sequences the edbi lstm model is capable to process the natural language and can also read create a sequence of arbitrary length kurata et al 2016 additionally the edbi lstm model works in a symbiotic manner and the input sequential data is trained by the rnn encoder decoder networks to generate the mapped output sequence recently this model gained popularity in different domains because of its high predictive accuracy fan et al 2019 karbasi et al 2022a 2022b park et al 2018 wang and zhang 2018 therefore the present study explored the viability of the edbi lstm model in monthly rainfall forecasting at haridwar and nainital locations the edbi lstm model includes two different parts i one for the interpretation of the input information of the sequence and encoding the fixed length vector and ii a second for decoding the vector and outputting the forecasted sequence the cell state stores the output of the encoded lstm on m time steps and supply the same as input to the decoder lstm on n time steps fu et al 2021 accordingly it can be stated that in each update the decoder feeds the model so that the output from the preceding update is considered as the input of the recent update because this sequence to sequence network solves the time step issue bian et al 2020 xiang et al 2020 zhang et al 2021a 2 6 generalized regression neural network grnn the grnn is a type of

output of the model is calculated based on the maximum probability principle cai et al 2021 the optimal parameters of the grnn model were obtained during the forward propagation step the input layer is connected to the pattern layer and defines a training pattern the output of the pattern layer is supplied to the summation layer which involves only two neurons namely s summation first and d

training sample and t state matrix transpose here the grnn model is discussed in brief for more information refers to specht 1991 2 7 random forest rf the rf technique is a classification and regression technique that entails the construction of a series of tree predictors each of which is created using a random vector independent from the input vector in regression the tree predictor uses numerical values rather than the class labels from the random forest classifier breiman 1999 random forest is a collection of cart model trees that have been proposed to improve its performance these trees are constructed from the set of input vectors using the bootstrap sampling method thus the selected input of all of them follows the same distribution despite their unique and independent structure the tree sets have a high correlation with each other which together with their strength and a large number causes the convergence of the model error also the mentioned features along with estimating the internal error of the model increase its ability to check more features and select the most effective parameters in this tree network the pruning process is not performed so the model error is limited to avoid over fitting the model the following are the steps in the rf method breiman 2001 i from the original dataset x different bootstrap samples x i i bootstrap iteration are randomly selected two thirds of the samples are bootstrapped while the remaining one third are out of bag samples each tree is designed in such a way that it corresponds to a subset of the bootstrap ii at each node in the tree a new split is chosen at random from all indices and the regression tree s splitting criterion is the input variable with the lowest mean square error mse iii the data splitting procedure is repeated in each internal node until all randomized trees are created and a stop condition is achieved iv the following are the final regression results where b represents the total number of trees in the forest and t b signifies each tree 16 y x i 1 b b 1 b t b x i 2 8 adaptive boosting regression adaboost adaboost an abbreviation for adaptive boosting is a type of boosting algorithm proposed in 1997 by freund and schapire 1997 this approach first establishes an initial distribution on a training set then repeats the process using adaptive weights to attain a stopping condition over the training set one of the algorithm s key concepts is to preserve a weight distribution training samples are weighted based on a classifiers after it has been developed the reweighted training samples are then used to build the next classifier to sum it up when training is complete the individual classifiers are merged to form a final highly accurate classifier a weight is maintained for each individual occurrence and the more weight an individual instance has the greater weight that individual instance has on the classifier that is trained pedregosa et al 2011 the adaboost approach uses the following algorithm to get its results el bilali et al 2021 i entering training data d x 1 y 1 x m y m where x m represents a feature vector y m represents a target vector

learning methods have been developed with the aim of solving the engineering problems related to the forecasting of time series which according to their potential can lead to more accurate and better results than other classical methods of ml karbasi et al 2022b 2022a in simulating highly non linear problems such as rainfall even deep learning methods such as the edbi lstm in individual form are not able to achieve proper accuracy in this research to overcome those drawbacks the edbi lstm scheme is integrated with powerful signal decomposition methods and other efficient pre processing techniques the tvf emd method by eliminating the shortcomings of the emd scheme in hybridization with a edbi lstm algorithm has a significant ability to solve highly non linear problems also the results can show that applying a dimensionality reduction method such as the svd method can be effective in reducing the cost of calculations and increasing accuracy combining the benefits of each part of the hybrid model presented in this study has made it possible to get promising results to forecast the monthly rainfall in india s different climate zones the proposed hybrid ai models i e tvf emd svd rf tvf emd svd edbi lstm tvf emd svd adaboost and tvf emd svd grnn have been developed on a pc with an intel core i7 intell r cpu 3 4 ghz and 8 gb of memory the open source python libraries keras arnold 2017 and tensorflow abadi 2016 were used to construct the edbi lstm and scikit learn library was employed for the adaboost development also the rf grnn tvf emd svd and pacf approaches were adopted in the matlab 2018a environment the schematic flowchart of the monthly forecasting rainfall using the developed hybrid ai models is illustrated in fig 4 the comprehensive details of constructing the hybrid ai models are described in the following steps 4 step 1 significant time lagged inputs extraction one of the most critical steps in constructing the forecasting models is to determine the antecedent information and the lagged time of the considered time series there are various techniques for lags determination such as pacf and types of feature selection methods which pacf is taken into account as the most common tool in the literature fig 5 illustrates the graphical representation of the acf and pacf of both rainfall signals of haridwar and nainital stations to determine the significant antecedent information lags to apply on decomposed components as can be seen from fig 5 in both stations the rainfall t 1 rainfall t 2 and rainfall t 3 are candidate for applying in models development although the lagged times of 6 7 8 and 9 could be influential in the modeling by furthermore assessments the authors ascertained that their effect is negative on the accuracy of the models on both stations so it is ignored and confined to the first three lags 5 step 2 first phase of signals decomposition tvf emd the main aim of using the pre processing tvf emd technique was its ability on mitigate mode mixing of the nonstationary rainfall signals and seek the amplitude modulation of the noisy modes which are yielded by the random distribution of extrema song 2021 song et al 2021a the tvf emd instead of the classical emd scheme can handle the impact of noisy signals during the envelope construction step of decomposition techniques for this purpose various intrinsic mode functions imfs were examined by trial and error procedure and 5 sub sequences 4 imfs and one residual were picked as the optimal imfs fig 6 demonstrates the decomposed sub sequences in each site of the study as the default values the b spline order and stopping criterion were considered equal to 26 and 0 1 respectively for both sites in this regard for each site 3 lags antecedent candidate input extracted from the pacf were typically decomposed and 15 sub sequences 5 imfs multiplied by 3 lags were obtained from the first preprocessing stage the other setting parameters of the tvf emd pre processing technique such as b spline order end flag and stopping criterion are specified in table 3 6 step 3 second phase of decomposition svd the most important goal of the second decomposition stage is dimensionality reduction and increases the accuracy of rainfall forecasting here the sub sequences i e imfs and the residual created by the tvf emd decomposition technique are used to further decompose by the svd model considering a predefined 40 dimensionality reduction fig 7 describes the reduction of the candidate input matrix by using the svd decomposition scheme with number of singular vectors 9 the predefined adjustment parameters of the svd model such as the number of singular vectors number of iterations block size and setting mean center criterion are given in table 3 besides the numbers of training and testing datasets after imposing the lags are mentioned in table 3 7 step 4 models feeding and configuration as mentioned before the duration of modeling was from 1961 to 2015 the most common data allocating approach for the training and testing datasets in time series based engineering problems is ordinary direct dividing datasets into sub sets prasad et al 2020 quilty and adamowski 2018 for this aim 75 of whole dataset 41 years was used for training the models and the rest 25 dataset 14 years was employed for testing of the models besides prior splitting the datasets all the data sets for the hybrid and standalone ai models were normalized between 0 and 1 to enhance the stability and convergence as the following formulation 29 r f rf r f min r f max r f min where r f is the normalized rainfall value and rf is the real time rainfall value moreover rf m i n and rf m a x are the minimum and maximum values of rainfall respectively 7 1 setting of machine learning approaches basically the choice of regulatory parameters for the ai model has a significant impact on improving the forecasting results to achieve this goal meta heuristic algorithms random search and grid search strategies are often used in this research the grid search method was used to optimize the parameters of the models table 4 lists all the optimized hyper parameters of utilized ai methods in rainfall simulation the important hyper parameters ofthe edbi lstm model are the number of layers neuron number learning rate epoch value training algorithm and activation operator zhang et al 2021b whereas the significant setting parameters of the adaboost approach jamei et al 2021 are learning rate n estimators and loss function it is noteworthy that the rf and grnn hyper parameters are tree number maximum number of features and spread value respectively 8 application results and analysis in this study the proposed hybrid i e tvf emd svd edbi lstm tvf emd svd rf tvf emd svd adaboost tvf emd svd grnn and the standalone i e lstm rf adaboost and grnn ai models were assessed based on r rmse mae nse kge and ia indicators to forecast monthly rainfall at haridwar and nainital stations table 5 highlighted the performance of the proposed hybrid tvf emd svd edbi lstm model against the other benchmark comparison models on haridwar station during training and testing periods based on r rmse mae nse kge and ia values the hybrid tvf emd svd edbi lstm model achieved the highest values of r 0 9688 nse 0 9383 kge 0 9422 ia 0 9836 and lowest error magnitudes for rmse 35 4671 mm mae 25 1577 mm followed by the hybrid tvf emd svd rf tvf emd svd adaboost and tvf emd svd grnn models in the testing period on the hand the accuracy of standalone models was relatively poor in relation to the hybrid models also it was found that the lstm model in the testing period with r 0 5870 rmse 118 4782 mm mae 72 4846 mm nse 0 3116 kge 0 3927 and ia 0 7000 appears to be better than the rf adaboost and grnn models overall the hybrid tvf emd svd edbi lstm model outperformed in both the training and testing scenarios against other comparing ai models to forecast the monthly rainfall at haridwar table 6 showing the accuracy of newly developed ai models i e hybrid version and standalone at nainital station to forecast monthly rainfall the hybrid tvf emd svd edbi lstm model again appears to be the most accurate to forecast monthly rainfall based on the adopted assessment metrics for example these metrics in the testing period are r 0 9698 rmse 44 3963 mm mae 28 5545 mm nse 0 9388 kge 0 9614 ia 0 9846 best for tvf emd svd edbi lstm model as compared to tvf emd svd rf tvf emd svd adaboost tvf emd svd grnn lstm rf adaboost and grnn models to forecast monthly rainfall on nainital fig 8 ranks the proposed hybrid tvf emd svd edbi lstm tvf emd svd rf tvf emd svd adaboost tvf emd svd grnn and the standalone lstm rf adaboost and grnn models based on r nse kge and ia the analysis undoubtedly proved that the hybrid models are ranked higher than the standalone counterpart models by achieving higher values of the r nse kge and ia for the haridwar and nainital sites but the tvf emd svd edbi lstm ranked at the top ranked 1 exhibited higher magnitudes of the r nse kge and ia metrics in both the candidate sites haridwar and nainital the tvf emd svd rf model ranked on 2nd position followed by tvf emd svd adaboost tvf emd svd grnn rf edbi lstm adaboost and grnn models for both locations the tvf emd svd edbi lstm model showpromising accuracy based on the r nse kge and ia values for both sites against the other comparing ai models fig 8 fig 9 exposes the relationship between the monthly forecasted and measured rainfall mm of the tvf emd svd edbi lstm tvf emd svd rf tvf emd svd adaboost tvf emd svd grnn lstm rf adaboost and grnn models in terms of scatter plots along with r and rmse for haridwar and nainital sites to assess the comparison of the models for haridwar site the tvf emd svd edbi lstm model had r 0 9688 rmse 35 4671 mm while tvf emd svd rf tvf emd svd adaboost and tvf emd svd grnn models had r 0 9475 0 9425 0 9399 and rmse 48 1584 mm 53 6252 mm 51 5689 mm this comparison indicates the better performance of the tvf emd svd edbi lstm model than the other hybrid models in forecasting the monthly rainfall in addition he standalone lstm rf adaboost and grnn models perform poorly to forecast monthly rainfall at haridwar similarly the tvf emd svd edbi lstm model was excellent in forecasting monthly rainfall at nainital site followed by tvf emd svd rf tvf emd svd grnn and tvf emd svd adaboost while again the standalone counterpart models were found to be very poor thus fig 9 established that the tvf emd svd edbi lstm model was better in forecasting monthly rainfall for both sites fig 10 shows the taylor diagram of referenced measured and forecasted rainfall for haridwar and nainital sites using the tvf emd svd edbi lstm tvf emd svd rf tvf emd svd adaboost tvf emd svd grnn lstm rf adaboost and grnn models taylor diagram taylor 2001 is basically based on standard deviation rmse and coefficient of correlation in a polar coordinate system to portrays how far lies the forecasting models from the referenced measured rainfall a model with a minimum value of standard deviation rmse and maximum value of r is believed to be the best an alternative approach to determine the model precision is if the forecasted rainfall is closer to the measured rainfall is indicated as the best model fig 10 clearly shows that the tvf emd svd edbi lstm model was close to the measured referenced rainfall for both sites followed by tvf emd svd rf tvf emd svd adaboost and tvf emd svd grnn models the standalone model s i e the lstm rf adaboost and grrn lies far away from the measured rainfall depicting poor accuracy fig 11 reveals the residuals between the forecasted and measured rainfall in violin plots of the tvf emd svd edbi lstm tvf emd svd rf tvf emd svd adaboost and tvf emd svd grnn models at haridwar and nainital sites the tvf emd svd edbi lstm model generates the lowest residual in violin plot distributions confirming that the errors were very small between the forecasted and measured rainfall with iqr 35 03 for haridwar and iqr 37 33 for nainital respectively fig 12 demonstrates the comparison between the measured rainfall against the forecasted rainfall generated by the hybrid version of the tvf emd svd edbi lstm tvf emd svd rf tvf emd svd grnn and tvf emd svd adaboost left models along with their violin plots distribution right by analyzing the tvf emd svd edbi lstm model seemed to be the most precise in forecasting the rainfall which exactly follows the pattern and stability corresponding to the measured rainfall with their same violin distribution generation of the monthly rainfall for haridwar and nainital sites this can be easily seen from fig 12 where the comparing benchmark models i e the tvf emd svd rf tvf emd svd grnn and tvf emd svd adaboost yield lower accuracy in terms of time series plots for forecasted versus measured rainfall with distinct violin distribution sizes which confirms respectively large fluctuations and spikes overall the tvf emd svd edbi lstm model achieves better accuracy against comparing ai hybrid models for haridwar and nainital sites a clear distinction of comparison of the hybrid tvf emd svd edbi lstm model was established using the boxplots fig 13 in combination with the relative deviation metrics i e q25 inter quartile range iqr q75 and mean demonstrates that the distribution of forecasted rainfall generated from benchmarking hybrid ai models i e tvf emd svd rf tvf emd svd grnn and tvf emd svd adaboost for haridwar and nainital sites were fairly scattered registering some outliers yet the box plot distribution of the hybrid tvf emd svd edbi lstm model has a very accurate interpretation for both stations based on q25 iqr q75 and mean values in fig 13 thus the boxplots for both sites ascertain the excellent forecasting accuracy of the hybridized tvf emd svd edbi lstm model the empirical cumulative distribution function ecdf of the forecasted monthly rainfall by the tvf emd svd edbi lstm versus tvf emd svd rf tvf emd svd grnn and tvf emd svd adaboost models are plotted in fig 14 for haridwar and nainital the ecdf of the tvf emd svd edbi lstm model displayed a very close profile against the benchmark hybrid comparing ai models which further establishes better precision of the tvf emd svd edbi lstm model in forecasting monthly rainfall the scope of this work can be widen using the satellite derived input predictors to improve the forecasting capability of the tvf emd svd edbi lstm model in addition the synoptic scale climate mode indices are extremely influencing rainfall patterns and the employment of these indices can suggest a more detail study in parallel with the integration with federated learning yaseen 2022 the hybridization of deep learning with numerical weather prediction nwp models can offer a new emerging area in this field of the research further the scope can be enhanced by implementing the ensemble strategies with uncertainty assessment the multi decomposition tvf emd svd edbi lstm modelling framework can potentially be employed in other sectors of interest such as air quality monitoring systems agriculture crops droughts hydrology and renewable and sustainable energy areas under climate change scenarios in a nutshell it is established that the multi decomposition tvf emd svd edbi lstm modelling framework can be helpful for water resources management extreme rainfall events droughts and hydrology 9 conclusion and remarks this research assesses how to provide a robust and efficient model to accurately forecast the monthly rainfall with the nonstationary signal using a double decomposition scheme and advanced machine learning models to achieve this goal a novel tvf emd based multi decomposition modelling framework was designed to forecast monthly rainfall the proposed multi decomposition modelling framework was based on the tvf emd which is integrated with svd and encoder decoder bidirectional lstm i e tvf emd svd edbi lstm for monthly rainfall forecasting on haridwar and nainital sites india furthermore for comparison purposes three advanced data driven models including the rf adaboost and grrn were coupled to construct the hybrid ai models i e tvf emd svd rf tvf emd svd grnn and tvf emd svd adaboost the original signals of monthly rainfall were decomposed into several imfs using the tvf emd technique to overcome the non stationarity and non linearity issues further the svd algorithm was introduced to reduce the dimensionality of imfs signals which can convert the signals imfs into a more stable and linear form finally the svd based signals were then supplied as inputs into the encoder decoder bidirectional lstm to design the tvf emd svd edbi lstm model for monthly rainfall forecasting likewise the rf adaboost and grrn models were also assessed to compare each model in hybrid and standalone versions the robustness of the models was examined based on goodness of fit metrics i e r rmse mae nse kge and ia and various graphical interpretation tools the tvf emd svd edbi lstm model was appeared to be the most accurate by achieving the most precise values in terms of r 0 5870 rmse 118 4782 mm mae 72 4846 mm nse 0 3116 kge 0 3927 and ia 0 7000 for haridwar site similarly these metrics are accurate for nainital site with r 0 9698 rmse 44 3963 mm mae 28 5545 mm nse 0 9388 kge 0 9614 and ia 0 9846 to forecast monthly
