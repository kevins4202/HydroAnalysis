2700,in this paper a unified method has been proposed for the percentage shear force carried by floodplains using fewer non dimensional parameters such as the floodplain s percentage area the ratio of manning s roughness and the depth ratio this new data driven dynamic model for percentage shear force is obtained using a genetic algorithm ga program a well documented machine learning software which can examine the existing relationship among the variables and explore the influencing factors ga facilitated a unified relationship between apparent shear force and the chosen parameters the new proposed model is simple and accurate compared to the previous models which were either complex or distinct for different configurations the efficiency of the new model shows that the most predicted test case results are under the 5 error cap the cohesive expression derived for smooth and roughened compound channels is the most significant advantage of the ga based data driven model providing a simple and easy use formula for engineers to apply for broad applications compared with the other available approaches the model proposed provides the most accurate discharge prediction for various

the most common river topography is two or multi stage compound channels in response to the effects of the geomorphological changes due to differential flow discharges the compound channel has characteristics that the main channel delivers the flow in low to moderated flow conditions while the floodplain carries out the extra flow in very high flow conditions see fig 1 in the design of the river cross sections and urban channels engineers typically consider the stable bank slope of compound channels with vegetation to favour the environment reinforce the bank soil and dissipate peak flow during extreme conditions abernethy and rutherfurd 2001 weiming and zhiguo 2009 wang et al 2014 it is well known that civilisation and agricultural cultivation have encroached on most of the floodplain area due to exponential growth in pressure of population expansion and infrequent bankfull discharges parker 1995 correia et al 1999 helmiö 2004 huai et al 2013 thus timely and accurate prediction of stage discharge relationships is critical to developing a sustainable floodplain policy in urban areas kavousizadeh ahmadi 2018 manfreda et al 2020 over the past several decades researchers have developed discharge estimation methods for uniform flow in compound channels these methods can be generalised into sub categories as one two and three dimensional hydraulic methods covering from traditional single channel method scm to very complex reynolds averaged navier stokes equation ranse based solutions that acquire many computation resources fig 2 the performance index of these methods have been presented in previous works e g prinos and townsend 1984 wormleaton and merrett 1990 seckin 2004 yang et al 2007 unal et al 2010 sahu et al 2011 al khatib et al 2012 al khatib and gogus 2014 fernandes et al 2015 hamidifar et al 2016 singh and khatua 2018 singh and tang 2020a singh et al 2022 however the downside in accounting for appropriate predictors and choosing the least time consuming method persists due to dominant time and cost inclusion in data collection and data specific solutions developed through a singularity in geometry and roughness of compound open channels for example the traditional single or divided channel method dcm either underestimates or overestimates the discharge the main reason is that those traditional methods do not consider the impact of momentum exchange at the interface between the two subsections to evaluate this impact as mentioned earlier many researchers have developed various methods to assess the effect of momentum exchange at the interface e g by the modified wetted parameter wormleaton et al 1982 the modified area of subsection khatua et al 2012 mohanty and khatua 2014 devi et al 2016 the inclusion of apparent shear stress based on the velocity difference or difference in velocity square huthoff et al 2008 prinos and townsend 1984 wormleaton and merrett 1990 christodoulou 1992 moreta and martin vide 2010 chen et al 2016 and the consideration of apparent shear force singh et al 2019a tang 2017a b tang 2018a b tang 2019a b singh and tang 2020b the apparent shear based method has a sound rational basis and shows promising results for a specific range of data however those methods are mainly based on an empirical function of apparent shear which also has a different form for different compound channels e g symmetric asymmetric homogeneous and heterogeneous compound channels and their combinations this paper focuses on developing a new unified and generalised model to calculate flow in compound channels a genetic algorithm ga is used to model the percentage shear force sf f carried by floodplains depending on geometric and hydraulic parameters for predicting zonal and overall discharge previous methods on the same background have produced numerous models which were categorically specific to the different geometry and roughness devi et al 2016 moreta and martin vide 2010 chen et al 2016 singh et al 2019a singh and tang 2020b these models limitations were related to the countless independent variables setting or limited bounds of the datasets involved in training the main focus of the derived mathematical model was to obtain a generalised solution for any combination of homogeneous heterogeneous symmetrical and asymmetrical compound channels fig 3 the current approach is more straightforward and capable of evaluating the intensity of momentum transfer across interfaces near the zero shear line using percentage shear force percentage area and depth ratio of the compound channels for predicting discharge the development of the regression based model is a never ending process because when a new set of data is introduced to the old data collection it needs training and regression of curve fitting to produce optimal results the diversity of the ever growing datasets is well appreciated by using big data analytics the ever growing datasets make the model uniquely specific when new data are added to the old datasets the new techniques like ga are convenient since this modelling technique provides solutions to problems which do not have a pre requisite formula or functions this new methodology can be helpful to the study of hydrodynamic studies and river engineers wu and chau 2006 cheng et al 2005 this philosophy inspired us to move forward with the curve fitting method with the genetic algorithm strategy the present paper is organised as follows section 2 describes state of the art with a critical review of the existing models for percentage shear force sf f and stage discharge after identifying the research gap the methodology involved in the modelling of the percentage shear force sf f is elaborated in section 3 then an overview of the validation and calibration datasets is depicted showing the broad spectrum of data with their classification in section 4 the parametrisation and variable dependency for the model development are tested and presented in section 5 where a wide range of data is taken to resolve the singularity issue mentioned above and the previous case specific solutions derivation in section 6 results for validation and calibration data are presented with the analysis of the performance of the derived model the overall conclusions are presented in section 7 2 state of the art 2 1 previous boundary shear distribution models the boundary shear stress distribution plays a pivotal role in understanding the hydrodynamics flow behaviour of sedimentation erosion and pollution dispersion in compound open channels previously knight and demetriou 1983 knight and hamed 1984 khatua and patra 2007 khatua et al 2012 mohanty and khatua 2014 and devi and khatua 2020 showed distinctive sf f models using the non linear function of geometrical parameters for different types of compound channels refer to table 1 the two main issues in all these models are suitability and complexity suitability issue is recalled for the model fixation to a primarily single type of configuration of channels meanwhile the model complexity is summoned because the enormous geometrical and roughness variables used in the model development make the application challenging moreover the robustness of the models can also be questionable with the model s validity defined using a low width ratio b b as given in table 1 consequently ga came into the picture in this study where an enormous set of data are used to produce a single unified and general model with the least variables and suitable for a wide range of configuration of compound open channel flow 2 2 overall and zonal discharge estimation using modified interactive length the flow of the floodplain affects the net force on the main channel which should be compensated by enlarging the main channel s wetted perimeter and reducing the floodplain s wetted perimeter the assumption that the sum of the boundary shear forces acting on the channel plus the shear force on the assumed interface must be equal to the weight component of the fluid is no different from the force balance criteria used in all these models the unique measures of the particular model were to relate an interfacial length for inclusion on the main channel from floodplain wetted perimeter as an interaction length to compensate for the inadequacy in the divided channel model thus this takes care of the accelerating force between each section considering the force balance of each part of the channel per unit length i e main channel and floodplain it follows 1 p c τ c x c τ c ρ g a c s o 2 p f τ f x f τ f ρ g a f s o where p is the wetted perimeter τ is the averaged boundary shear stress ρ is the density of the fluid g is the acceleration due to gravity a is the area and x is the interacting length at the interface and is calculated by 3 x c p c 100 100 sf f a c a 1 4 x f p f 100 100 sf f a c a 1 1 where sf f is the percentage of boundary shear force of the floodplain note c f subscripts are used for the main channel and floodplain respectively empirically khatua et al 2012 and mohanty and khatua 2014 suggested sf f as the function of geometrical parameters of the channel for symmetric smooth eq 5 and rough eq 6 channels respectively furthermore devi et al 2016 proposed a similar eq 7 for the asymmetric compound channel 5 sf f 4 1045 a f 0 6917 6 sf f 3 3245 a f 0 717 1 1 02 β log 10 n r 7 sf f 3 576 a f 0 717 where a f is the percentage of the floodplain area n r is the ratio of manning coefficients between the main channel and floodplain n f n c thus the zonal discharge can be obtained by 8 q c s o n c a c 5 3 p c x c 2 3 9 q f s o n f a f 5 3 p f x f 2 3 in eqs 8 and 9 manning s equation is used where q is the discharge it should be noted that sf f in eqs 5 7 was empirically derived for the set of experiments where the largest width ratio of the experimental test range was 6 67 also note that there is not yet any proposed model of sf f for rough asymmetric channels which could be open for discussion in the future 3 methodology and background genetic algorithm genetic algorithm ga is a meta heuristic evolutionary algorithm well explored in water resources by numerous researchers srinivasa raju and nagesh kumar 2004 guven and aytek 2009 azamathulla et al 2011 tayfur and singh 2011 azamathulla and zahiri 2012 pradhan and khatua 2018 kazemi et al 2018 khuntia et al 2018 ghalandari et al 2019 the ga is a full fledged genotype phenotype system which has surpassed the old genetic programming systems ferreira 2001 guven and aytek 2009 koza 1994 introduced a new evolutionary algorithm based on the population of potential subsets of results structured using simulation singh et al 2019a b this is to say that a population of models evolved in the algorithm are optimised to secure the most optimal solution on the ground of fitness functions model subsets are presented in the form of chromosomes which incidentally are the powerful suit of the algorithm jafari marandi and smith 2017 chromosomes are the solution to the encoding problem which needs a decoding function to convert chromosomes encoded as answers the advantage of the ga based modelling used in this study is to obtain the solution s robustness in finding the best curve fit for the randomised validation set the model must keep its characteristic behaviour when it is disturbed or uncertain liu et al 2021 we use a ga algorithm to find the best optimal model for the percentage of shear force sf f which endorses the regression s robustness without losing the parameters physical nature fig 4 presents a general flowchart of the algorithm of the ga initially ga produces random chromosomes as many as the number of populations in the binary chromosomes system the cells of the chromosomes are filled with zeros and ones by the same chance at each step chromosomes are decoded to physical representative answers and consequently their fitness value is calculated the fitness value is the goodness of the model or solution according to the problem crossover and mutation are the essential roles of this well known biological evolution and metaphor based genetic programming this means that random change and sharing in solutions from the last best output are obtained through simulations crossover is a bi chromosomal operator that requires two chromosomes to modify and present output two entering chromosomes will mix and produce one or two new chromosomes s called offspring crossover is the elite optimality derived from the ga swaying the population towards better fitness on the contrary the mutation is not bi chromosomal and does not march the solution towards optimality the primary function of mutation is to keep the algorithm to the local optima by radically changing the entering chromosomes the mutation is the extent to which the operator can tweak the initial chromosome the mutation rate is the term for managing the behavioural factors of the program the pivotal step in the algorithm is to decide when to stop the evolution and produce the solution with the best selective model there is no specific way ga can ensure the optimal solution unless stopping strategies are indicated in advance by the operator in fact there are different terminating criteria to identify the optima for termination of evolution termination criteria can be either as simple as a specific number of iterations or more intrinsically involved by setting scaled improvements in genetic operators and functional setups 4 overview of datasets 4 1 review of the training and corroboration datasets in the process of curve fitting or regression designated under the data driven modelling classification and function dependency study requires a large set of data the development of a regression based model is ever growing because dataset dynamicity is increasing with time and evolution therefore continuous training and validation through regression and curve fitting are required to incorporate developments in the model to produce optimal results the diversity and the improvement in the machine learning techniques can help to accommodate any dynamicity and augmentation in the number of datasets in this study four sets of configurations are categorically divided as smooth symmetric smooth asymmetric rough symmetric and rough asymmetric as shown in fig 5 in total 29 investigators data have been used in this analysis containing 90 test cases that are uniquely identified in tables 2 and 3 under nomenclature section fig 5 depicts four sets of experimental data in compound channel studies from ghosh and jena 1971 to al khatib and gogus 2014 including a wide range of channels covering small to large scale laboratory based data interestingly the configurational division representing the compound channel studies shows that most investigations are made under smooth and rough symmetric open channel flows the symmetric channel data is 76 and asymmetric channel data is 24 of the total experimental test cases of this 24 of data only 6 is for the rough asymmetric channels in the previous investigations of other authors the sf f model developed for the asymmetric channels has considered even fewer data sets as involved in this study per the authors best knowledge understanding the datasets representation of the different configurations helps to identify the gap in the available experimental compound open channel data furthermore the overall objective of this study is to produce a unified single mathematical model for the sf f which can be predicted with the most accuracy irrespective of the configuration of the compound open channels 4 2 range and summary of training and corroboration datasets to model sf f a wide range of datasets has been compiled and used here as given in table 2 the vast datasets used for training are randomly chosen through the hold out technique one of the easiest and most widely used cross validation methods these datasets include small scale experimental data and have large scale heterogeneous and homogeneous symmetrical and asymmetrical data data from the flood channel facility fcf is also undertaken which is archived by the second author refer to https www flowdata bham ac uk forty two datasets are used here out of which 21 are smooth and the other are rough compound channels three out of the first twenty one have homogenous smooth asymmetrical channels while three from the 21 rough datasets have heterogeneous asymmetric geometry i e the floodplain has differential roughness compared to the main channel table 2 summarises all the relevant parameter ranges for each training dataset in this study on the contrary table 3 illustrates the pertinent parameter ranges for experimental test cases of the corroboration and testing datasets randomly identified without bias to ensure that every type of variable has been trained in the model a complete data set is randomly divided in the ga engine for each training group multiple iteration based simulations were carried out to check the model s sensitivity furthermore to affirm the robustness of the model the goodness of fit and correlation of coefficients were monitored to produce reliable models 5 model development parametrisation functional dependency and genetic operators before modelling using ga studying the function dependability between independent functions as a f depth ratio dr and n r to the dependent function sf f will significantly help to understand the correlation coefficient and behaviour of the variables under scrutiny in the processes of curve fitting and regression designated under data driven modelling classification and function dependence study of the variable needs sensitive evaluation for each variable the performance of the final model depends on not only the correlation of individual independent variables but also the sensitivity of the variables the dependency of the selected variable has been done concerning the plots obtained in fig 6 other variables tested as given in table 1 were considered but then dropped deliberately the combination of geometric or roughness characteristics like aspect ratio α depth ratio dr width ratio β and the percentage of the floodplain to main channel width β f roughness ratio n r and slope s o was individually tested the final independent variables selected are a f dr and n r since they incorporate all the geometric and roughness characteristics and have a direct correlation see fig 6 as pointed out by devi and khatua 2020 the derived power law function for the sf f in terms of the corresponding a f in fig 6 a for homogenous smooth channels show a high coefficient of determination r2 as 0 97 for the training datasets given in table 2 fig 6 b illustrates a power function for the heterogeneous rough compound channels refer to table 2 with the dependent function as sf f to independent function a f having r2 as 0 67 furthermore in fig 6 c and d an attempt has been made to see the variation of sf f with the dr which shows r2 as 0 40 and 0 61 for the smooth and rough channels respectively the plots in fig 6 also depict the model equations in comparison to the distinctive equations given in eqs 5 and 7 for the symmetric and asymmetric channels fig 6 a appears to have a unified non linear relationship between sf f and a f for smooth symmetric and asymmetric compound channels thus distinctive models based on the geometry of the channels can be ignored however the models have a distinct behavioural trend based on roughness the overall idea of this study was to obtain a unified single mathematical expression that serves to predict the sf f for any type of configuration of the compound open channels flow by examing the current behaviour of the non linear model using power law ga is used with the genetic operator and functional set having the linking function as addition and multiplication with head size not increasing more than four a fitness function governs the qualitative analysis of each iteration in this case the coefficient of determination r2 is selected as the fitness function from the vast range of possibilities available models the data type identified in the ga was kept integer meanwhile other parameters such as mutation inversion and gene transpositions are kept standard for the first trial and then tweaked until an optimised fitness function is obtained table 4 summarises the genetic operator used for entire iteration sets 6 results and discussion 6 1 model calibration ga s statistical performance and termination are established through the coefficient of determination r2 first and foremost function dependency and sensitivity analysis are carried out to identify the critical independent function required in the modelling the training set is then fed to the ga where optimised models are obtained based on the selective iteration under different functional sets and genetic operator combinations table 5 shows the best five fitted functions where three for smooth homogeneous channels and two are the subset of the overall mathematical model of s f f see eq 10 10 s f f f i t p s u b s e t 1 f i t k s u b s e t 2 eq 10 was the base function definition where subset 1 and 2 becomes zero for the simple channel data i e no floodplain and subset two becomes zero when the smooth channel is applied since l n n r becomes zero the two subsets are linked to the additive function in ga processing for heterogeneous rough channels the final model suggested from the overall functions simulated has been chosen not only from the r2 value but also considering the simplicity of the model application in the following argument fit p1 is chosen as subset 1 with r2 as 0 98 the highest obtained in the ga modelling see table 5 for subset 2 fit k1 is finalised with the maximum r2 as 0 91 in table 5 in modelling so the final selected eq 11 is for the smooth and rough compound channels while the model of k is given in eq 12 as aforementioned the value of the model of k is based on the roughness ratio such that for smooth channels it takes the value zero the overall model eq 11 has unified in such a way that one model is sufficient to predict sf f for any compound channels note that n r is nf n c dr is h h h where h is bankfull depth and the log used is the natural logarithm the s f f is defined as the shear force of floodplain per weight of fluid ρ grso and a f is the area of floodplain per total area of the channel in percentage 11 s f f 3 3320 a f 0 7645 14 6809 dr 0 9402 k 12 k ln n r 9 2743 11216 4057 dr 2 1 a f 1 437 a practical property of the proposed model is to yield zonal and overall discharge using a linear scale analytical solution given through eqs 8 9 combined with eqs 3 4 and eqs 11 12 to estimate the discharge accurately the divided channel method can be applied by including the interacting length xc to the main channel wetted perimeter and excluding the wetted perimeter xf of the floodplain see eqs 8 9 the sign convention of xc and xf explains the concept of the transfer of momentum from the main channel to the floodplain also the concept of zero shears at the suitable interface without momentum transfer is speculated that the interacting length is zero 6 2 model testing and validation to demonstrate the predictability and efficiency of the model given in eqs 11 and 12 fig 7 is shown for each of the 21 experiments for smooth and rough compound channels the error percentage of the predicted sf f is calculated based on eq 13 fig 7 a and b depict the scatter plot of the predicted versus experimental sf f for smooth and rough compound channels respectively for the entire datasets combined for the smooth compound channels the r2 value is 0 98 while for the rough compound channels the r2 value is 0 87 on the other hand fig 7 c shows the number of modelled datasets having percentage errors within the range of less than 3 10 and 20 the upper cap for this analysis is kept as data having a percentage error of more than 20 only 1 and 22 of the predicted sf f data are found above this categorical value of more than 20 for smooth and rough compound channels the new model s overall performance ranges under the 5 cap value with 73 2 and 38 5 of modelled data having percentage errors less than 5 for smooth and rough channels respectively 13 error r predicted i experimental i experimental i 100 6 3 application of the new model with its performance index forty six datasets in table 3 corroborate the total discharge qt for experimental data using the proposed model which are given in fig 8 fig 8 a and b show the predicted discharge percentage error for symmetric and asymmetric testing data for dcm with vertical vd and horizontal hd divisions and the new proposed model respectively due to their simplicity these solution techniques are used in commercial software such as mike 11 and the hydrologic research center river analysis system hec ras the performance of the proposed model is less than 5 for all the ranges of depth in smooth and rough compound channels except for the rough asymmetric data of joo and seng 2007 however dcm vd performed unsatisfactorily with 23 56 for the same data and the proposed model still had the range in the 10 bracket for different depth ratios fig 8 a and b depict the performance of the symmetric and asymmetric compound channels individually since the volume of test cases was 28 for symmetric and 19 for asymmetric channels the plots show the most negligible error for the new model where eqs 12 and 13 were used in conjunction with the estimation of interacting length at the interface eqs 3 4 and modified dcm eqs 8 9 furthermore fig 9 a c show the correlation between the predicted overall discharge and the overall experimental discharge for smooth symmetric fig 8a smooth asymmetric fig 8b and rough symmetric and asymmetric fig 8c configurations of the testing sets respectively again the results shown in fig 9 are individually exhibited since the range of the experimental discharge for the different test cases was erratic for a wide range of large to small scale channels for the overall stage discharge estimation the results in fig 9 have good agreement depicted through the best fit line the only visible discrepancy in the result can be seen in fig 8 c for the rough trapezoidal fcf 11 test cases with a percentage error of 10 7 conclusions this study proposes a new unified model of sf f using a genetic algorithm for any geometry or roughness compound open channel flows the overview of data registered over 90 test cases includes smooth rough asymmetric and symmetric compound channels the unified model given here has a tuning term defined as subset two and can generally be used for any compound channels irrespective of roughness configuration the value of subset two is deduced to zero when n r takes the value of one for smooth channels or otherwise adjusts the overall sf f value through an associative property of addition the main conclusions of this study can be summarised as follows 1 the unified mathematical expression for the s f f model is simple and has a very high prediction accuracy with 73 2 and 38 5 of data having a percentage error of less than 5 2 the accuracy and sensitivity of the new model of s f f highly accurate for any kind of configuration irrespective of the channel configurations the percentage error cap of the model illustrates a clear picture of the new model s performance 3 the proposed s f f model is further tested to corroborate discharge estimation using the inclusive interactive length concept in dcm methodology the analytical method for estimating flow discharge performs better than the conventional dcm method for symmetrical and asymmetrical channels the results obtained for the discharge estimation have an overall percentage error within the range of 5 10 with very few configurations above 10 4 further corroboration of the present model can be tested for the real time datasets to check the overall performance of the inclusive interactive length concept incorporating the proposed unified sf f model based on a genetic algorithm a new technique like ga is convenient for modelling since it provides solutions to problems with an explicit formula or function which can be quickly and realistically performed for new datasets however one of the future motivations is to achieve interpretable equations that can be applicable mathematically by other researchers or practitioners with physical insight into each parameter the limitation of the regression and fitted model is that it becomes uniquely specific for the conditions as the new datasets are added to the older datasets the unified model proposed can be applied realistically to diverse

2700,in this paper a unified method has been proposed for the percentage shear force carried by floodplains using fewer non dimensional parameters such as the floodplain s percentage area the ratio of manning s roughness and the depth ratio this new data driven dynamic model for percentage shear force is obtained using a genetic algorithm ga program a well documented machine learning software which can examine the existing relationship among the variables and explore the influencing factors ga facilitated a unified relationship between apparent shear force and the chosen parameters the new proposed model is simple and accurate compared to the previous models which were either complex or distinct for different configurations the efficiency of the new model shows that the most predicted test case results are under the 5 error cap the cohesive expression derived for smooth and roughened compound channels is the most significant advantage of the ga based data driven model providing a

the most common river topography is two or multi stage compound channels in response to the effects of the geomorphological changes due to differential flow discharges the compound channel has characteristics that the main channel delivers the flow in low to moderated flow conditions while the floodplain carries out the extra flow in very high flow conditions see fig 1 in the design of the river cross sections and urban channels engineers typically consider the stable bank slope of compound channels with vegetation to favour the environment reinforce the bank soil and dissipate peak flow during extreme conditions abernethy and rutherfurd 2001 weiming and zhiguo 2009 wang et al 2014 it is well known that civilisation and agricultural cultivation have encroached on most of the floodplain area due to exponential growth in pressure of population expansion and infrequent bankfull discharges parker 1995 correia et al 1999 helmiö 2004 huai et al 2013 thus timely and accurate prediction of stage discharge relationships is critical to developing a sustainable floodplain policy in urban areas kavousizadeh ahmadi 2018 manfreda et al 2020 over the past several decades researchers have developed discharge estimation methods for uniform flow in compound channels these methods can be generalised into sub categories as one two and three dimensional hydraulic methods covering from traditional single channel method scm to very complex reynolds averaged navier stokes equation ranse based solutions that acquire many computation resources fig 2 the performance index of these methods have been presented in previous works e g prinos and townsend 1984 wormleaton and merrett 1990 seckin 2004 yang et al 2007 unal et al 2010 sahu et al 2011 al khatib et al 2012 al khatib and gogus 2014 fernandes et al 2015 hamidifar et al 2016 singh and khatua 2018 singh and tang 2020a singh et al 2022 however the downside in accounting for appropriate predictors and choosing the least time consuming method persists due to dominant time and cost inclusion in data collection and data specific solutions developed through a singularity in geometry and roughness of compound open channels for example the traditional single or divided channel method dcm either underestimates or overestimates the discharge the main reason is that those traditional methods do not consider

rational basis and shows promising results for a specific range of data however those methods are mainly based on an empirical function of apparent shear which also has a different form for different compound channels e g symmetric asymmetric homogeneous and heterogeneous compound channels and their combinations this paper focuses on developing a new unified and generalised model to calculate flow in compound channels a genetic algorithm ga is used to model the percentage shear force sf f carried by floodplains depending on geometric and hydraulic parameters for predicting zonal and overall discharge previous methods on the same background have produced numerous models which were categorically specific to the different geometry and roughness devi et al 2016 moreta and martin vide 2010 chen et al 2016 singh et al 2019a singh and tang 2020b these models limitations were related to the countless independent variables setting or limited bounds of the datasets involved in training the main focus of the derived mathematical model was to obtain a generalised solution for any combination of homogeneous heterogeneous symmetrical and asymmetrical compound channels fig 3 the current approach is more straightforward and capable of evaluating the intensity of momentum transfer across interfaces near the zero shear line using percentage shear force percentage area and depth ratio of the compound channels for predicting discharge the development of the regression based model is a never ending process because when a new set of data is introduced to the old data collection it needs training and regression of curve fitting to produce optimal results the diversity of the ever growing datasets is well appreciated by using big data analytics the ever growing datasets make the model uniquely specific when new data are added to the old datasets the new techniques like ga are convenient since this modelling technique provides solutions to problems which do not have a pre requisite formula or functions this new methodology can be helpful to the study of hydrodynamic studies and river engineers wu and chau 2006 cheng et al 2005 this philosophy inspired us to move forward with the curve fitting method with the genetic algorithm strategy the present paper is organised as follows section 2 describes state of the art with a critical review of the existing models for percentage shear force sf f and stage discharge after identifying the research gap the methodology involved in the modelling of the percentage shear force sf f is elaborated in section 3 then an overview of the validation and calibration datasets is depicted showing the broad spectrum of data with their classification in section 4 the parametrisation and variable dependency for the model development are tested and presented in section 5 where a wide range of data is taken to resolve the singularity issue mentioned above and the previous case specific solutions derivation in section 6 results for validation and calibration data are presented with the analysis of the performance of the derived model the overall conclusions are presented in section 7 2 state of the art 2 1 previous boundary shear distribution models the boundary shear stress distribution plays a pivotal role in understanding the hydrodynamics flow behaviour of sedimentation erosion and pollution dispersion in compound open channels previously knight and demetriou 1983 knight and hamed 1984 khatua and patra 2007 khatua et al 2012 mohanty and khatua 2014 and devi and khatua 2020 showed distinctive sf f models using the non linear function of geometrical parameters for different types of compound channels refer to table 1 the two main issues in all these models are suitability and complexity suitability issue is recalled for the model fixation to a primarily single type of configuration of channels meanwhile the model complexity is summoned because the enormous geometrical and roughness variables used in the model development make the application challenging moreover the robustness of the models can also be questionable with the model s validity defined using a low width ratio b b as given in table 1 consequently ga came into the picture in this study where an enormous set of data are used to produce a single unified and general model with the least variables and suitable for a wide range of configuration of compound open channel flow 2 2 overall and zonal discharge estimation using modified interactive length the flow of the floodplain affects the net force on the main channel which should be compensated by enlarging the main channel s wetted perimeter and reducing the floodplain s wetted perimeter the assumption that the sum of the boundary shear forces acting on the channel plus the shear force on the assumed interface must be equal to the weight component of the fluid is no different from the force balance criteria used in all these models the unique measures of the particular model were to relate an interfacial length for inclusion on the main channel from floodplain wetted perimeter as an interaction length to compensate for the inadequacy in the divided channel model thus this takes care of the accelerating force between each section considering the force balance of each part of the channel per unit length i e main channel and floodplain it follows 1 p c τ c x c τ c ρ g a c s o 2 p f τ f x f τ f ρ g a f s o where p is the wetted perimeter τ is the averaged boundary shear stress ρ is the density of the fluid g is the acceleration due to gravity a is the area and x is the interacting length at the interface and is calculated by 3 x c p c 100 100 sf f a c a 1 4 x f p f 100 100 sf f a c a 1 1 where sf f is the percentage of boundary shear force of the floodplain note c f subscripts are used for the main channel and floodplain respectively empirically khatua et al 2012 and mohanty and khatua 2014 suggested sf f as the function of geometrical parameters of the channel for symmetric smooth eq 5 and rough eq 6 channels respectively furthermore devi et al 2016 proposed a similar eq 7 for the asymmetric compound channel 5 sf f 4 1045 a f 0 6917 6 sf f 3 3245 a f 0 717 1 1 02 β log 10 n r 7 sf f 3 576 a f 0 717 where a f is the percentage of the floodplain area n r is the ratio of manning coefficients between the main channel and floodplain n f n c thus the zonal discharge can be obtained by 8 q c s o n c a c 5 3 p c x c 2 3 9 q f s o n f a f 5 3 p f x f 2 3 in eqs 8 and 9 manning s equation is used where q is the discharge it should be noted that sf f in eqs 5 7 was empirically derived for the set of experiments where the largest width ratio of the experimental test range was 6 67 also note that there is not yet any proposed model of sf f for rough asymmetric channels which could be open for discussion in the future 3 methodology and background genetic algorithm genetic algorithm ga is a meta heuristic evolutionary algorithm well explored in water resources by numerous researchers srinivasa raju and nagesh kumar 2004 guven and aytek 2009 azamathulla et al 2011 tayfur and singh 2011 azamathulla and zahiri 2012 pradhan and khatua 2018 kazemi et al 2018 khuntia et al 2018 ghalandari et al 2019 the ga is a full fledged genotype phenotype system which has surpassed the old genetic programming systems ferreira 2001 guven and aytek 2009 koza 1994 introduced a new evolutionary algorithm based on the population of potential subsets of results structured using simulation singh et al 2019a b this is to say that a population of models evolved in the algorithm are optimised to secure the most optimal solution on the ground of fitness functions model subsets are presented in the form of chromosomes which incidentally are the powerful suit of the algorithm jafari marandi and smith 2017 chromosomes are the solution to the encoding problem which needs a decoding function to convert chromosomes encoded as answers the advantage of the ga based modelling used in this study is to obtain the solution s robustness in finding the best curve fit for the randomised validation set the model must keep its characteristic behaviour when it is disturbed or uncertain liu et al 2021 we use a ga algorithm to find the best optimal model for the percentage of shear force sf f which endorses the regression s robustness without losing the parameters physical nature fig 4 presents a general flowchart of the algorithm of the ga initially ga produces random chromosomes as many as the number of populations in the binary chromosomes system the cells of the chromosomes are filled with zeros and ones by the same chance at each step chromosomes are decoded to physical representative answers and consequently their fitness value is calculated the fitness value is the goodness of the model or solution according to the problem crossover and mutation are the essential roles of this well known biological evolution and metaphor based genetic programming this means that random change and sharing in solutions from the last best output are obtained through simulations crossover is a bi chromosomal operator that requires two chromosomes to modify and present output two entering chromosomes will mix and produce one or two new chromosomes s called offspring crossover is the elite optimality derived from the ga swaying the population towards better fitness on the contrary the mutation is not bi chromosomal and does not march the solution towards optimality the primary function of mutation is to keep the algorithm to the local optima by radically changing the entering chromosomes the mutation is the extent to which the operator can tweak the initial chromosome the mutation rate is the term for managing the behavioural factors of the program the pivotal step in the algorithm is to decide when to stop the evolution and produce the solution with the best selective model there is no specific way ga can ensure the optimal solution unless stopping strategies are indicated in advance by the operator in fact there are different terminating criteria to identify the optima for termination of evolution termination criteria can be either as simple as a specific number of iterations or more intrinsically involved by setting scaled improvements in genetic operators and functional setups 4 overview of datasets 4 1 review of the training and corroboration datasets in the process of curve fitting or regression designated under the data driven modelling classification and function dependency study requires a large set of data the development of a regression based model is ever growing because dataset dynamicity is increasing with time and evolution therefore continuous training and validation through regression and curve fitting are required to incorporate developments in the model to produce optimal results the diversity and the improvement in the machine learning techniques can help to accommodate any dynamicity and augmentation in the number of datasets in this study four sets of configurations are categorically divided as smooth symmetric smooth asymmetric rough symmetric and rough asymmetric as shown in fig 5 in total 29 investigators data have been used in this analysis containing 90 test cases that are uniquely identified in tables 2 and 3 under nomenclature section fig 5 depicts four sets of experimental data in compound channel studies from ghosh and jena 1971 to al khatib and gogus 2014 including a wide range of channels covering small to large scale laboratory based data interestingly the configurational division representing the compound channel studies shows that most investigations are made under smooth and rough symmetric open channel flows the symmetric channel data is 76 and asymmetric channel data is 24 of the total experimental test cases of this 24 of data only 6 is for the rough asymmetric channels in the previous investigations of other authors the sf f model developed for the asymmetric channels has considered even fewer data sets as involved in this study per the authors best knowledge understanding the datasets representation of the different configurations helps to identify the gap in the available experimental compound open channel data furthermore the overall objective of this study is to produce a unified single mathematical model for the sf f which can be predicted with the most accuracy irrespective of the configuration of the compound open channels 4 2 range and summary of training and corroboration datasets to model sf f a wide range of datasets has been compiled and used here as given in table 2 the vast datasets used for training are randomly chosen through the hold out technique one of the easiest and most widely used cross validation methods these datasets include small scale experimental data and have large scale heterogeneous and homogeneous symmetrical and asymmetrical data data from the flood channel facility fcf is also undertaken which is archived by the second author refer to https www flowdata bham ac uk forty two datasets are used here out of which 21 are smooth and the other are rough compound channels three out of the first twenty one have homogenous smooth asymmetrical channels while three from the 21 rough datasets have heterogeneous asymmetric geometry i e the floodplain has differential roughness compared to the main channel table 2 summarises all the relevant parameter ranges for each training dataset in this study on the contrary table 3 illustrates the pertinent parameter ranges for experimental test cases of the corroboration and testing datasets randomly identified without bias to ensure that every type of variable has been trained in the model a complete data set is randomly divided in the ga engine for each training group multiple iteration based simulations were carried out to check the model s sensitivity furthermore to affirm the robustness of the model the goodness of fit and correlation of coefficients were monitored to produce reliable models 5 model development parametrisation functional dependency and genetic operators before modelling using ga studying the function dependability between independent functions as a f depth ratio dr and n r to the dependent function sf f will significantly help to understand the correlation coefficient and behaviour of the variables under scrutiny in the processes of curve fitting and regression designated under data driven modelling classification and function dependence study of the variable needs sensitive evaluation for each variable the performance of the final model depends on not only the correlation of individual independent variables but also the sensitivity of the variables the dependency of the selected variable has been done concerning the plots obtained in fig 6 other variables tested as given in table 1 were considered but then dropped deliberately the combination of geometric or roughness characteristics like aspect ratio α depth ratio dr width ratio β and the percentage of the floodplain to main channel width β f roughness ratio n r and slope s o was individually tested the final independent variables selected are a f dr and n r since they incorporate all the geometric and roughness characteristics and have a direct correlation see fig 6 as pointed out by devi and khatua 2020 the derived power law function for the sf f in terms of the corresponding a f in fig 6 a for homogenous smooth channels show a high coefficient of determination r2 as 0 97 for the training datasets given in table 2 fig 6 b illustrates a power function for the heterogeneous rough compound channels refer to table 2 with the dependent function as sf f to independent function a f having r2 as 0 67 furthermore in fig 6 c and d an attempt has been made to see the variation of sf f with the dr which shows r2 as 0 40 and 0 61 for the smooth and rough channels respectively the plots in fig 6 also depict the model equations in comparison to the distinctive equations given in eqs 5 and 7 for the symmetric and asymmetric channels fig 6 a appears to have a unified non linear relationship between sf f and a f for smooth symmetric and asymmetric compound channels thus distinctive models based on the geometry of the channels can be ignored however the models have a distinct behavioural trend based on roughness the overall idea of this study was to obtain a unified single mathematical expression that serves to predict the sf f for any type of configuration of the compound open channels flow by examing the current behaviour of the non linear model using power law ga is used with the genetic operator and functional set having the linking function as addition and multiplication with head size not increasing more than four a fitness function governs the qualitative analysis of each iteration in this case the coefficient of determination r2 is selected as the fitness function from the vast range of possibilities available models the data type identified in the ga was kept integer meanwhile other parameters such as mutation inversion and gene transpositions are kept standard for the first trial and then tweaked until an optimised fitness function is obtained table 4 summarises the genetic operator used for entire iteration sets 6 results and discussion 6 1 model calibration ga s statistical performance and termination are established through the coefficient of determination r2 first and foremost function dependency and sensitivity analysis are carried out to identify the critical independent function required in the modelling the training set is then fed to the ga where optimised models are obtained based on the selective iteration under different functional sets and genetic operator combinations table 5 shows the best five fitted functions where three for smooth homogeneous channels and two are the subset of the overall mathematical model of s f f see eq 10 10 s f f f i t p s u b s e t 1 f i t k s u b s e t 2 eq 10 was the base function definition where subset 1 and 2 becomes zero for the simple channel data i e no floodplain and subset two becomes zero when the smooth channel is applied since l n n r becomes zero the two subsets are linked to the additive function in ga processing for heterogeneous rough channels the final model suggested from the overall functions simulated has been chosen not only from the r2 value but also considering the simplicity of the model application in the following argument fit p1 is chosen as subset 1 with r2 as 0 98 the highest obtained in the ga modelling see table 5 for subset 2 fit k1 is finalised with the maximum r2 as 0 91 in table 5 in modelling so the final selected eq 11 is for the smooth and rough compound channels while the model of k is given in eq 12 as aforementioned the value of the model of k is based on the roughness ratio such that for smooth channels it takes the value zero the overall model eq 11 has unified in such a way that one model is sufficient to predict sf f for any compound channels note that n r is nf n c dr is h h h where h is bankfull depth and the log used is the natural logarithm the s f f is defined as the shear force of floodplain per weight of fluid ρ grso and a f is the area of floodplain per total area of the channel in percentage 11 s f f 3 3320 a f 0 7645 14 6809 dr 0 9402 k 12 k ln n r 9 2743 11216 4057 dr 2 1 a f 1 437 a practical property of the proposed model is to yield zonal and overall discharge using a linear scale analytical solution given through eqs 8 9 combined with eqs 3 4 and eqs 11 12 to estimate the discharge accurately the divided channel method can be applied by including the interacting length xc to the main channel wetted perimeter and excluding the wetted perimeter xf of the floodplain see eqs 8 9 the sign convention of xc and xf explains the concept of the transfer of momentum from the main channel to the floodplain also the concept of zero shears at the suitable interface without momentum transfer is speculated that the interacting length is zero 6 2 model testing and validation to demonstrate the predictability and efficiency of the model given in eqs 11 and 12 fig 7 is shown for each of the 21 experiments for smooth and rough compound channels the error percentage of the predicted sf f is calculated based on eq 13 fig 7 a and b depict the scatter plot of the predicted versus experimental sf f for smooth and rough compound channels respectively for the entire datasets combined for the smooth compound channels the r2 value is 0 98 while for the rough compound channels the r2 value is 0 87 on the other hand fig 7 c shows the number of modelled datasets having percentage errors within the range of less than 3 10 and 20 the upper cap for this analysis is kept as data having a percentage error of more than 20 only 1 and 22 of the predicted sf f data are found above this categorical value of more than 20 for smooth and rough compound channels the new model s overall performance ranges under the 5 cap value with 73 2 and 38 5 of modelled data having percentage errors less than 5 for smooth and rough channels respectively 13 error r predicted i experimental i experimental i 100 6 3 application of the new model with its performance index forty six datasets in table 3 corroborate the total discharge qt for experimental data using the proposed model which are given in fig 8 fig 8 a and b show the predicted discharge percentage error for symmetric and asymmetric testing data for dcm with vertical vd and horizontal hd divisions and the new proposed model respectively due to their simplicity these solution techniques are used in commercial software such as mike 11 and the hydrologic research center river analysis system hec ras the performance of the proposed model is less than 5 for all the ranges of depth in smooth and rough compound channels except for the rough asymmetric data of joo and seng 2007 however dcm vd performed unsatisfactorily with 23 56 for the same data and the proposed model still had the range in the 10 bracket for different depth ratios fig 8 a and b depict the performance of the symmetric and asymmetric compound channels individually since the volume of test cases was 28 for symmetric and 19 for asymmetric channels the plots show the most negligible error for the new model where eqs 12 and 13 were used in conjunction with the estimation of interacting length at the interface eqs 3 4 and modified dcm eqs 8 9 furthermore fig 9 a c show the correlation between the predicted overall discharge and the overall experimental discharge for smooth symmetric fig 8a smooth asymmetric fig 8b and rough symmetric and asymmetric fig 8c configurations of the testing sets respectively again the results shown in fig 9 are individually exhibited since the range of the experimental discharge for the different test cases was erratic for a wide range of large to small scale channels for the overall stage discharge estimation the results in fig 9 have good agreement depicted through the best fit line the only visible discrepancy in the result can be seen in fig 8 c for the rough trapezoidal fcf 11 test cases with a percentage error of 10 7 conclusions this study proposes a new unified model of sf f using a genetic algorithm for any geometry or roughness compound open channel flows the overview of data registered over 90 test cases includes smooth rough asymmetric and symmetric compound channels the unified model given here has a tuning term defined as subset two and can generally be used for any compound channels irrespective of roughness configuration the value of subset two is deduced to zero when n r takes the value of one for smooth channels or otherwise adjusts the overall sf f value through an associative property of addition the main conclusions of this study can be summarised as follows 1 the unified mathematical expression for the s f f model is simple and has a very high prediction accuracy with 73 2 and 38 5 of data having a percentage error of less than 5 2 the accuracy and sensitivity of the new model of s f f highly accurate for any kind of configuration irrespective of the channel configurations the percentage error cap of the model illustrates a clear picture of the new model s performance 3 the proposed s f f model is further tested to corroborate discharge estimation using the inclusive interactive length concept in dcm methodology the analytical method for estimating flow discharge performs better than the conventional dcm method for symmetrical and asymmetrical channels the results obtained for the discharge estimation have an overall percentage error within the range of 5 10 with very few configurations above 10 4 further corroboration of the present model can be tested for the real time datasets to check the overall performance of the inclusive interactive length concept incorporating the proposed unified sf f model based on a genetic algorithm a new technique like ga is convenient for modelling since it provides solutions to problems with an explicit formula or function which can be quickly and realistically performed for new datasets however one of the future motivations is to achieve interpretable equations that can be applicable mathematically by other researchers or practitioners with physical insight into each parameter the limitation of the regression and fitted model is that it becomes uniquely specific for the conditions as the new datasets are added to the older datasets the unified model proposed can be applied realistically to diverse

2701,the upper yangtze river basin uyrb provides almost half of the total runoff volume of the entire yangtze river and is of great importance for the population living in the upstream and downstream regions the recent streamflow decline and more frequent hydroclimatic extremes have raised concerns about the water sustainability and water security of the uyrb in a changing climate here we examine the hydrological changes in the uyrb during the historical period 1961 2020 and the future period 2021 2070 using a physically based hydrological model based on the simulation results the future changes in water resources and hydroclimatic extremes in the uyrb were analyzed the results show that the mean annual runoff volume in the uyrb during the future period will further decrease by 20 4 ssp1 2 6 17 7 ssp2 4 5 and 22 0 ssp5 8 5 billion m3 compared with the historical mean value the agricultural drought severity will increase in all sub regions which tends to be more severe than the meteorological droughts and wujiang is going to experience the largest increase in drought severity averaged across the uyrb the unprecedented agricultural droughts and pluvials will occur more than once per decade on average in the future indicating that the most extreme events in the historical period would become the new normal in the future the design floods with different return periods at all major hydrological stations in the uyrb are projected to increase and in the future there will be more frequent drought pluvial seesaws at the major hydrological stations these findings highlight the importance of adaptive water resources management to tackle the elevated risk of water shortage and more frequent and severe hydroclimatic extremes in the future uyrb keywords upper yangtze river basin water resources hydroclimatic extremes droughts and floods drought pluvial seesaw climate change data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the yangtze river is the longest river in china and the third longest river in the world jiao et al 2020 the upper yangtze river basin uyrb refers to the catchment upstream of the yichang hydrological station which covers more than 50 of the total area and contributes almost 50 of the total runoff of the entire yangtze river basin gao et al 2012 shi et al 2022a numerous hydropower projects have been constructed in the uyrb since the 1950 s including the world s largest hydropower plant to date the three gorges dam qin et al 2022 shi et al 2022a due to the combined effects of climate change and human activities a significant decrease in annual streamflow has been reported in the uyrb in the past few decades constraining the socio economic development of the region including the densely populated chengdu chongqing economic circle shi et al 2022a yang et al 2015b zhao et al 2015 in the context of climate change the future hydrological change in the uyrb is of great importance to the operation of hydropower plants and the large population living in the upstream and downstream regions many studies have attempted to project the future changes in annual runoff in the uyrb combining the future climate data from coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 models and different hydrological models previous studies expected the future runoff in the uyrb to increase su et al 2017 wen et al 2020 zhong et al 2020 decrease huang et al 2021 wang et al 2019b and increase or decrease depending on emission scenarios chen et al 2017 wu et al 2021 based on the future climate data from the latest coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 cmip6 models qin et al 2022 adopted the soil and water assessment tool swat model and expected increases in future streamflow in the uyrb zhao et al 2022 adopted variable infiltration capacity vic model and found that the river runoff would decrease in the future due to larger increases in evapotranspiration et compared with increases in precipitation p causing declines in hydropower generation the existing understanding of the future changes in annual runoff of the uyrb remains uncertain due to the selection of input data and hydrological models moreover the uyrb is largely affected by permafrost and seasonally frozen ground especially in the source region of the yangtze river sryr upstream of zhimenda station where almost 80 of the area is underlain by permafrost shi et al 2020 zou et al 2017 the models adopted by previous studies cannot well depict the cryospheric hydrological processes which might hinder the accurate projection of future water resources in the uyrb besides the changes in annual runoff the hydroclimatic extreme events i e droughts and floods also change in a warming climate stevenson et al 2022 flood hazards are projected to increase in many regions of the world which put more population at risk and lead to increased economic damages due to economic growth merz et al 2021 tellman et al 2021 unprecedented droughts will occur in the future and the extreme conditions in the historical period might become the new normal satoh et al 2022 stevenson et al 2022 the uyrb is a region vulnerable to droughts and floods the 2009 2010 drought in the uyrb and southwest china was a once in a century drought event which caused severe adverse impacts on water supply vegetation growth and human society li et al 2019 xu et al 2015 the uyrb has also experienced numerous destructive floods throughout history which jeopardize the safety of dams and the lives and properties of the people fang et al 2018 therefore it s imperative to assess the risk of droughts and floods in the uyrb under climate change to provide insights for adaptive water resources management some studies have already evaluated the future changes in hydroclimatic extremes in the uyrb huang et al 2021 wen et al 2020 wu et al 2021 but the spatio temporal characteristics of changes in droughts and pluvials remain largely unknown in addition to the assessment of drought and pluvials separately a type of temporally compounding event drought pluvial seesaw or drought flood alternation has raised rising concerns recently he and sheffield 2020 zscheischler et al 2020 a well known example is the multi year intense drought in california during 2011 2016 followed by large scale pluvial events which triggered the failure of the oroville dam s primary spillway swain et al 2018 wang et al 2017 the drought to deluge transition can also occur at the seasonal scale which might exert extra stress on vegetation growth shi et al 2022b in the yangtze river basin previous studies focused more on the drought flood alternation in the middle and lower yangtze river shan et al 2018 recently yang et al 2022 examined the drought pluvial seesaws in the entire yangtze river basin during 1961 2015 and linked the occurrence of the alternation to teleconnection factors but they only used precipitation to identify the seesaw events the soil moisture condition and river discharge are more direct factors that influence agriculture and water resources management but the spatial patterns and future changes of drought pluvial seesaws in terms of soil moisture condition and river discharge in the uyrb remain elusive to fill the existing knowledge gap this study attempts to examine the spatio temporal changes in annual runoff and hydroclimatic extremes during the future 50 years 2021 2070 compared with the historical period 1961 2020 across the uyrb based on the simulation results from a physically based hydrological model the objectives of this study are to i reveal the future possible changes in annual runoff in different sub regions of the uyrb ii examine the future changes in meteorological and agricultural droughts pluvials and drought pluvial seesaws at the gridded scale and iii assess the future changes in hydrological droughts and floods at different hydrological stations in the uyrb 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the uyrb is located at elevations ranging from 38 m a s l in the east chengdu plain to 7500 m a s l in the west sryr located in the northeastern tibetan plateau fig 1 shi et al 2022a the outlet of the uyrb yichang station is about 40 km downstream of the three gorges dam the entire uyrb can be divided into eight sub regions including four sub regions in the main stream i e the

fig 1 the mean annual air temperature maat and mean annual p generally increases from west to east with the largest mean annual p exceeding 1600 mm located in the central uyrb where the terrain drastically changes from mountain to plain fig s1a b 2 2 simulation of historical and future hydrological changes 2 2 1 brief introduction to the physically based hydrological model the geomorphology based ecohydrological model gbehm was adopted by this study to simulate the hydrological changes in the uyrb during the historical period 1961 2020 and the future period 2021 2070 the gbehm is a physically based distributed hydrological model that uses hillslope valley units to effectively depict the runoff generation and river routing processes gao et al 2018 yang et al 2015a compared with its predecessor the geomorphology based hydrological model gbhm yang et al 1998 yang et al 2002 the improvements of gbehm include i the simple biosphere model sib2 was used to estimate et gao et al 2016 and a dynamic vegetation module was added to simulate the climate driven vegetation changes based on the coupled water carbon processes shi et al 2022a ii an energy balance module was added which could consider the soil freeze thaw and other cryospheric hydrological processes in the cold regions and enable the simulation of coupled water heat dynamics gao et al 2018 more details of gbehm can be found in yang et al 2015a and gao et al 2018 due to these features the gbehm has been successfully applied to simulate the hydrological processes in many cold regions including the upper heihe river basin gao et al 2018 the upper yellow river basin qin et al 2017 and the uyrb shi et al 2022a the model runs at an hourly time step with a spatial resolution of 8 km and the model settings for the historical period 1961 2020 simulation in this study are the same as those in shi et al 2022a more details about the input data including historical meteorological soil elevation and vegetation data can be found in shi et al 2022a the simulation results have proved to reflect the spatio temporal variations of water balance components in different sub regions of the uyrb reasonably well shi et al 2022a here we attempt to extend the simulation period and use the model to project the hydrological changes during the future period in the uyrb 2 2 2 future projections based on the cmip6 data in order to simulate the hydrological changes in the future period 2021 2070 this study collected the meteorological output from five cmip6 models during the historical and future period eyring et al 2016 the five models including bcc csm2 mr mri esm2 0 ipsl cm6a lr cnrm esm2 1 and ec earth3 table 1 were selected because they were found to perform relatively well in the uyrb jiang et al 2020 li et al 2021 cmip6 models define the combinations of shared socioeconomic pathways ssps and representative concentration pathways rcps o neill et al 2016 and we select the ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios representing the low end medium road and high end of the range of future pathways respectively the quantile delta mapping method qdm was adopted for bias correction of the meteorological output from the cmip6 models cannon et al 2015 lange 2019 first for a specific meteorological variable the cumulative distribution function cdf of the historical observations historical data from cmip6 models and future data from cmip6 models were calculated at each grid box for each month of the year denoted by f1 x f2 x f3 x respectively second for a future value to be corrected from the cmip6 models xsim fut we calculated its cumulative probability f3 xsim fut and found the corresponding values in historical observations f1 1 f3 xsim fut and historical cmip6 data f2 1 f3 xsim fut the bias corrected future value xsim fut cor was then calculated by either of the following two equations 1 x sim f u t c o r f 1 1 f 3 x sim f u t x sim f u t f 2 1 f 3 x sim f u t 2 x sim f u t c o r f 1 1 f 3 x sim f u t x sim f u t f 2 1 f 3 x sim f u t for the variables that need to consider the absolute changes like air temperature eq 1 was selected for bias correction for variables that need to consider the relative changes like precipitation and wind speed eq 2 was adopted for bias correction bias correction was applied at the spatial scale of the gcm output then the corrected values were spatially downscaled to a finer scale 8 km as required by the hydrological model using the method described by wang et al 2018b the future changes in maat and annual p in the uyrb under three climate scenarios after bias correction and downscaling are shown in fig 2 a b the bias corrected and downscaled meteorological variables from cmip6 models were then adopted as the input data of gbehm for future simulation 2 3 identification of droughts and pluvials at gridded scale in this study we evaluate the droughts and pluvials in the uyrb both at the gridded scale based on precipitation and soil moisture conditions and at the hydrological stations based on the river discharge data this section will first introduce the methods for identifying droughts and pluvials at the gridded scale we consider two standardized metrics which allow comparisons over time and space as proxies of drought and pluvial conditions from both the meteorological and agricultural perspectives the first one is the standardized precipitation index over a 3 month period spi3 qin et al 2015 xu et al 2015 the precipitation data can be fitted by a gamma probability density function g x with the cumulative distribution function g x at each grid box for each month of the year 3 g x 1 b a γ a x a 1 e x b f o r x 0 4 g x 1 b a γ a 0 x x a 1 e x b d x f o r x 0 where x is the cumulative precipitation in 3 months a and b are the shape and scale parameter respectively which can be estimated by the maximum likelihood method xu et al 2015 let t x b and eq 4 can be transformed into an incomplete gamma function farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 qin et al 2015 5 g x 1 γ a 0 x t a 1 e t d t there are extreme situations when cumulative precipitation x 0 as a result the equation is then modified as 6 h x q 1 q g x where q is the probability of x 0 estimated by the occurrence frequency of x 0 in the entire observation series finally the spi value is obtained by transforming h to the standard normal distribution 7 spi φ 1 h where φ is the standard normal distribution compared with precipitation soil moisture is a more direct variable that affects vegetation growth similarly we calculate the standardized soil moisture index over a 3 month period ssi3 farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 the calculation process of ssi3 is similar to that of spi3 the only difference is that the xin eqs 3 5 now changes to 3 month mean soil moisture content from the simulation results of gbehm at 5 cm depth it should be noted that when determining the parameters in eqs 3 5 only the precipitation or soil moisture data during historical period 1961 2020 are adopted when spi3 or ssi3 at a grid cell is below 1 0 or above 1 0 the drought and pluvial conditions are identified he and sheffield 2020 we refer to the droughts pluvials identified by spi3 and ssi3 as meteorological and agricultural droughts pluvials respectively if spi3 or ssi3 keeps below 1 0 above 1 0 for consecutive months we define the number of months as the duration of a certain drought pluvial event and the dimensionless cumulative area of spi3 or ssi3 values below 1 0 above 1 0 as the drought pluvial severity hong et al 2015 fig s2 the total number of months in the state of drought pluvial is calculated by the sum of duration of all the drought pluvial events during a certain time period e g a decade and termed as time in drought pluvial if the following pluvial drought event has a start date that is within three months of the end date of the preceding drought pluvial event then we define this phenomenon as a drought pluvial seesaw event he and sheffield 2020 fig s2 a drought pluvial seesaw indicates that precipitation or soil moisture shifts from drier wetter than normal to wetter drier than normal within three months here we also define unprecedented droughts and pluvials for each grid box we can obtain a drought pluvial event that has the largest severity in the historical period if the severity of drought pluvial events in the future exceeds the most severe one in the historical period we call them unprecedented droughts pluvials in the following sections the figures and tables for the drought and pluvial indictors will show the mean value of the simulation results based on the meteorological output of five cmip6 models 2 4 calculation of hydrological droughts and floods at hydrological stations similar to the calculation of spi3 and ssi3 that represents the drought and pluvial conditions of precipitation and soil moisture we use the standardized runoff index over a 3 month period sri3 hong et al 2015 shukla and wood 2008 to represent the dry and wet conditions of streamflow the x in eqs 3 5 now changes to the 3 month cumulative runoff volume from the simulation results of gbehm at each hydrological station in the uyrb in this study the thresholds 1 0 and 1 0 were selected to identify the hydrological droughts and pluvials the definition of drought pluvial duration severity drought pluvial seesaw and unprecedented droughts pluvials are the same as the introduction in section 2 3 in addition to the hydrological pluvials identified by sri3 which reflect wetter than normal conditions at the seasonal scale we are also concerned about the floods at shorter time scales which can cause detrimental hazards from the daily discharge derived from gbehm at each hydrological station the peak over threshold pot method is adopted to retrieve the flood events tang and carey 2017 yang et al 2019 the threshold is set to be two which means that there would be a total of about 120 flood events retrieved in the historical period two events per year on average for the 60 year historical period based on the peak discharge of the retrieved flood events in the historical and future period the design floods with different return periods 10 years 20 years 50 years 100 years can be calculated by fitting the peak discharge to certain probability distribution functions with the help of a matlab toolbox called mvcat sadegh et al 2017 the candidate distribution functions provided by mvcat include generalized extreme value inverse gaussian birnbaum saunders lognormal gamma loglogistic nakagami rician normal logistic t location scale weibull extreme value rayleigh exponential and generalized pareto the parameters are estimated by maximum likelihood method and the distribution with the minimum bayesian information criterion bic is selected for fitting the peak discharge when identifying unprecedented pluvials in the future in addition to the method by sri3 as described before method 1 we also adopted an alternative method if the peak discharge of the retrieved flood events exceeds the historical maximum peak discharge we also define this future flood event as an unprecedented flood method 2 the two methods differ in terms of the time scale in addition we also calculate q95 and q5 from daily discharge data to examine the changes in the flow regime q95 and q5 represent the daily discharge that 95 and 5 of the flow records within a year exceed which are commonly used to represent low flow and high flow respectively huang et al 2021 wang et al 2019b 3 results 3 1 future changes in water balance and runoff volume the inter annual changes of maat p et and runoff depth r with the unit of mm in the uyrb are shown in fig 2 for visual clarity the three year moving average values are shown the maat in the future 2021 2070 is projected to increase by 1 67 c ssp1 2 6 1 83 c ssp2 4 5 and 2 40 c ssp5 8 5 relative to the average level during the historical period 1961 2020 with larger increases under more severe emission scenarios in comparison the future changes in the water balance components p et and r are not expected to vary much among the three scenarios the mean annual p during the future period is expected to increase by 27 2 mm ssp1 2 6 24 5 mm ssp2 4 5 and 34 1 mm ssp5 8 5 compared with the historical period but this increase is not able to compensate the increase in water consumption by et in a warmer future climate the increase in annual et is expected to be larger than that of annual p which is as much as 51 9 mm ssp1 2 6 46 0 mm ssp2 4 5 and 60 4 mm ssp5 8 5 respectively as a result the annual r in the uyrb will decrease by 21 4 mm ssp1 2 6 18 6 mm ssp2 4 5 and 23 0 mm ssp5 8 5 in the future relative to the historical average value fig 2 table 2 the future changes in water balance components in different sub regions of the uyrb during 2021 2070 relative to the average value during the historical period 1961 2020 are shown in table 2 it can be seen that the future annual p is expected to increase in all sub regions of the uyrb the largest increases will occur in the sryr above zhimenda where the mean annual p during the future period is expected to increase by 41 1 mm ssp1 2 6 40 5 mm ssp2 4 5 and 62 8 mm ssp5 8 5 compared with the historical average value the annual et is also expected to increase in all sub regions with the largest increases in wujiang above wulong where the future annual et is expected to increase by 94 9 mm ssp1 2 6 80 5 mm ssp2 4 5 and 99 1 mm ssp5 8 5 compared with the historical average value due to the generally larger increases of future annual et than those of future annual p the future annual r is expected to decrease in all sub regions of the uyrb except sryr above zhimenda and mintuojiang above gaochang the most dramatic decreases will occur in wujiang above wulong where the mean annual r during the future period is expected to decline by 87 3 mm ssp1 2 6 87 7 mm ssp2 4 5 and 95 7 mm ssp5 8 5 compared with the historical average value the changes in water resources indicated by runoff volume q with the unit of m3 at different hydrological stations are also calculated and shown in fig 3 for the five hydrological stations along the main stream shown as the first five subplots in fig 3 only the q at the most upstream station zhimenda is expected to increase in the future compared with the historical period while the q will decline at all other four stations at pingshan station the future mean annual q will decrease by 4 9 ssp1 2 6 5 0 ssp2 4 5 and 8 0 ssp5 8 5 billion m3 while at yichang station the annual q will decrease by 20 4 ssp1 2 6 17 7 ssp2 4 5 and 22 0 ssp5 8 5 billion m3 compared with the historical average value the decline in water resources at yichang station not only results from the q decline in the main stream but also from the q decline in the tributaries especially in wujiang above wulong where the annual q will decline by 7 1 ssp1 2 6 7 2 ssp2 4 5 and 7 9 ssp5 8 5 billion m3 in the future relative to the historical period the q decline in wujiang above wulong nearly contributes one third of the total q decline of the entire uyrb fig 3 3 2 future changes in meteorological and agricultural droughts and pluvials drought spatial features including time in drought and drought severity from spi3 and ssi3 in the historical period are shown in fig s3 in the future the time in drought and drought severity identified by spi3 show clear spatial patterns alleviated droughts in the northwest and exacerbated droughts in the southeast fig 4 a c the spatial patterns of future changes in agricultural droughts however are quite different fig 4b d the agricultural droughts will exacerbate in all sub regions regardless of the different changing directions of meteorological droughts table 3 wujiang above wulong is expected to experience the largest increases in agricultural drought severity where the meteorological drought severity increases are also the largest among the sub regions mintuojiang above gaochang is expected to experience the second largest increase in agricultural drought severity although the meteorological droughts in mintuojiang will change little in the future table 3 fig 4 we also calculate the time in pluvial and pluvial severity from spi3 and ssi3 and the spatial patterns during the historical period are shown in fig s4 in the future the time in pluvial and pluvial severity will increase in all sub regions of the uyrb except wujiang above wulong where the time in pluvial and pluvial severity identified by ssi3 show slight decreases fig 5 table 3 the results indicate that most regions in the uyrb will experience increased time and larger severity in meteorological and agricultural pluvials compared with the historical period especially in the northwestern uyrb fig 5 given the future increases in drought and pluvial severity identified by spi3 and ssi3 in the uyrb we further examine whether and how often the unprecedented droughts and pluvials will occur in the future which exceed the most severe drought and pluvial in the historical period according to our estimates the unprecedented agricultural droughts and pluvials will occur more often than the unprecedented meteorological droughts and pluvials fig 6 averaged across the uyrb the unprecedented agricultural droughts and pluvials will occur about 1 0 and 1 5 times per decade indicating that the hydroclimatic extremes that never happen in the historical 60 years will become the new normal as they will happen more than once for each decade on average in the future table 4 in some regions of the mintuojiang and wujiang the unprecedented droughts and pluvials identified by ssi3 will even occur more than twice per decade in the future period fig 6 table 4 we also examine the spatial patterns and future changes of drought pluvial seesaws the spatial patterns of the historical mean occurrence frequency of drought pluvial seesaws identified by spi3 and ssi3 are shown in fig 7 a b the hotspots of drought pluvial seesaws are mainly located in the mintuojiang and the main stream regions near cuntan and yichang the frequency of drought pluvial seesaws identified by ssi3 is lower than that identified by spi3 fig 7a b the frequency changes of drought pluvial seesaws in the future relative to the historical period are shown in fig 7c d the concurrent increases in future drought and pluvial severity are likely to increase future drought pluvial seesaw frequency identified by spi3 in the southeastern uyrb while the different changing directions in future drought and pluvial severity tend to cause no changes or decreases in future drought pluvial seesaw frequency identified by spi3 in the northwestern uyrb fig 4c 5c 7c as for the future changes in drought pluvial seesaws identified by ssi3 nearly all sub regions will experience increases and the largest increases occur in mintuojiang above gaochang where both future agricultural drought and pluvial severity are expected to increase table 3 averaged across the uyrb the seesaw frequency will increase by 0 6 and 2 1 times per decade in the future under the ssp5 8 5 scenario respectively identified by spi3 and ssi3 fig 7 table 3 3 3 future changes in hydrological droughts and floods we have examined the meteorological and agricultural droughts and pluvials using spi3 and ssi3 at the gridded scale and in this section we will examine the hydrological droughts and pluvials at the major hydrological stations identified by sri3 the future changes in time in drought drought severity time in pluvial pluvial severity and drought pluvial seesaw frequency are shown in table 5 the drought severity will increase at all hydrological stations under three climate scenarios and the largest increase will occur at wulong station wujiang table 5 we also examine the q95 low flow changes at different stations and the q95 at wulong station is expected to decrease significantly also suggesting exacerbated future risk of hydrological droughts at wujiang fig 8 unprecedented hydrological droughts will occur 2 7 ssp1 2 6 2 1 ssp2 4 5 and 2 5 ssp5 8 5 times per decade in the future period at wulong station table 6 while for the yichang station unprecedented hydrological droughts will occur 1 6 ssp1 2 6 1 7 ssp2 4 5 and 1 6 ssp5 8 5 times per decade on average in the future table 6 the time in pluvial and pluvial severity identified by sri3 will also increase at all stations in the uyrb except wulong indicating that the hydrological stations will experience increased time and larger severity in droughts and pluvials at the same time in the future period table 5 as a result the drought pluvial seesaw frequency identified by sri3 is expected to increase at all hydrological stations in the future with the largest increase at gaochang station mintuojiang for the yichang station the hydrological drought pluvial seesaw frequency will increase by 4 8 ssp1 2 6 3 3 ssp2 4 5 and 3 9 ssp5 8 5 times per decade on average in the future compared with the mean value during the historical period table 5 the results indicate that in the future the hydrological stations in the uyrb will face more frequent transitions between drier than normal and wetter than normal conditions in addition to the hydrological pluvials identified by sri3 which reflect the wetter than normal condition at the seasonal scale we also examine the flood changes at the daily scale using the daily discharge derived from the hydrological model the percentage changes of the design floods with different return periods in the future relative to the historical period are shown in table 7 it can be seen that the design floods at all stations with all return periods are projected to increase and larger percentage increases are generally expected for longer return periods at yichang station the discharge of 100 year flood will increase by 45 7 ssp1 2 6 27 9 ssp2 4 5 and 51 5 ssp5 8 5 in the future table 7 we calculate the future occurrence frequency of unprecedented pluvials respectively using sri3 method 1 and the daily peak discharge method 2 table 6 the results show that using sri3 the yichang station will experience 1 1 ssp1 2 6 0 9 ssp2 4 5 and 1 2 ssp5 8 5 unprecedented pluvials per decade on average in the future however there will be nearly no unprecedented floods at yichang station in the future using method 2 when using method 2 gaochang mintuojiang is expected to have the most unprecedented pluvials in the future this can also be reflected in the temporal changes of q5 high flow as the value of q5 shows an increasing trend in the future while the maximum value in the historical period is relatively low at gaochang station making the unprecedented floods relatively easy to happen in the future fig s5 4 discussion previous studies have shown that the annual runoff volume in the uyrb declined by 36 6 billion m3 from 1961 to 2015 which has raised concerns about the water sustainability and water security in the region especially for mintuojiang and jialingjiang where the megacities chengdu and chongqing are located shi et al 2022a the results of this study show that the average annual runoff volume in the future period 2021 2070 will further decrease by 20 4 ssp1 2 6 17 7 ssp2 4 5 and 22 0 ssp5 8 5 billion m3 for the entire uyrb compared with the historical average level during 1961 2020 although the annual p will increase in all sub regions the annual et is expected to increase by a larger proportion leading to future declines in water resources table 2 fig 3 our findings are similar to the results of previous studies huang et al 2021 wang et al 2019b zhao et al 2022 showing declining annual runoff in a warmer future uyrb which may exacerbate the water stress in the densely populated regions the possible declines in runoff volume could also affect hydropower generation negatively and threaten the rising electricity demands due to rapid urbanization and industrial development the meteorological and agricultural drought features including time in drought and drought severity have been identified by spi3 and ssi3 across the uyrb respectively the results show more severe exacerbation in agricultural drought than meteorological drought since the meteorological droughts show a spatial pattern of alleviation in the northwest and exacerbation in the southeast but the agricultural drought severity tends to increase in all sub regions fig 4 table 3 the possible reason is that the soil moisture conditions are affected not only by precipitation but also by air temperature qin et al 2015 xu et al 2015 likewise the spatial pattern of changes in future meteorological and agricultural pluvials are also different fig 5 table 3 since soil moisture is a more direct variable that affects vegetation growth spi3 might be not sufficient to reflect the water condition changes for ecosystem health and agricultural purposes and the indicators reflecting the effects of warming like ssi3 and standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei might be more appropriate in the context of climate change xu et al 2015 it should be noted that the above results are based on the mean value of the simulation results derived from five cmip6 models and there can be differences among the models to assess the uncertainty in projecting the future drought and pluvial indicators we show the consistency of five cmip6 models in projecting the future changing directions of the indicators fig s6 and fig s7 corresponding to fig 4 and fig 5 respectively we find that the future changing directions from different models are consistent in most regions of the uyrb and the changes identified by ssi3 generally show greater consistency among models than those identified by spi3 fig s6 s7 climate change could make the hydroclimatic extremes in the historical period become the new normal in the future stevenson et al 2022 here we show that the unprecedented droughts and pluvials exceeding the historical most severe ones would happen in the future uyrb and the frequency can be quite high in some sub regions averaged across the uyrb the unprecedented agricultural droughts and pluvials will occur more than once per decade on average in the future fig 6 table 4 we also find that the unprecedented hydrological droughts will occur about 1 6 times per decade in the future at the yichang station table 6 for the unprecedented pluvials at hydrological stations we use both sri3 and daily peak discharge to identify the occurrence frequency which represent different time scales of concern table 6 both unprecedented hydrological droughts and pluvials will occur frequently at gaochang station in the future table 6 which is consistent with the frequent occurrence of both unprecedented agricultural droughts and pluvials in mintuojiang above gaochang fig 6 table 4 although the annual runoff volume at gaochang will change little specifically we examine a type of temporally compounding event drought pluvial seesaws which represent the rapid transition between drier than normal conditions and wetter than normal conditions by using spi3 ssi3 and sri3 we only focus on the transitions between the droughts and pluvials at the seasonal or longer time scale which could largely affect the agriculture ecosystem and human society during the historical period the occurrence frequency of drought pluvial seesaws identified by ssi3 is lower than that identified by spi3 possibly since the soil moisture takes a longer time to respond to the precipitation dry wet or wet dry alternation fig 7a b in contrast the future seesaw frequency identified by ssi3 will increase more than that identified by spi3 averaged across the uyrb table 3 fig 7c d the possible mechanism is that the larger vapor pressure deficit due to rising temperature could enhance evaporation and accelerate the depletion of soil moisture gu et al 2022 qing et al 2022 yuan et al 2019 leading to more rapid formation of agricultural droughts and more frequent transitions between agricultural droughts and pluvials the increased drought pluvial alternation might put extra stress on vegetation growth shi et al 2022b which needs to be further examined by future research previous studies focus more on the drought flood alternation in the middle and lower yangtze river shan et al 2018 while this study finds that there will be more frequent drought pluvial seesaws identified by sri3 at all hydrological stations in the future uyrb table 5 the increased climate volatility might be the reason for the intensified hydrological cycle he and sheffield 2020 the increases in drought pluvial seesaw frequency along with the considerable increases in design floods with different return periods at all hydrological stations table 7 bring unprecedented threats and challenges to the operation and management of the numerous hydropower plants across the uyrb here we take a closer look at the sryr which is largely underlain by permafrost which is part of the sanjiangyuan nature reserve and serves as an important ecological barrier and a unique shelter for wildlife wang et al 2018a the future projections of this study have already included the effects of potential permafrost degradation since gbehm has the energy balance module to simulate frozen ground changes and coupled water heat dynamics gao et al 2018 shi et al 2020 we find that although the meteorological droughts in the sryr will be alleviated the agricultural droughts however will be exacerbated in the future fig 4 table 3 besides the increased air temperature that is true for the entire uyrb permafrost degradation might be another reason for this discrepancy in the sryr the existence of permafrost prevents the water from moving downward and constrains soil water within the active layer the seasonally freeze thaw layer above permafrost in a warming future climate the active layer will thicken and permafrost will finally completely thaw wang et al 2019a wang et al 2020 zhang et al 2022 these changes could enhance infiltration lead to surface soil desiccation and enhance drought severity identified by ssi3 the shallow rooted vegetation on the tibetan plateau will find it harder to obtain soil moisture which may lead to grassland degradation and desertification and has to be paid more attention to in a warming climate jin et al 2022 teufel and sushama 2019 the permafrost degradation induced infiltration will also increase groundwater flow and baseflow gao et al 2018 wang et al 2018a which is also reflected by the estimated increasing trends of q95 low flow at zhimenda and shigu in the historical and future period fig 8 it should be noted that the analyses of this study are based on the simulation results from the physically based model gbehm although the model has made considerable improvements in depicting the cryospheric hydrological and vegetation related processes the impacts of direct human activities like reservoir operation and human water consumption have not been included yet in other words the results of this study only reflect the climate driven future changes in water resources and hydroclimatic extremes in the uyrb our findings highlight the necessity of adaptive water resources management in response to less annual runoff and more severe hydroclimatic extremes in the future uyrb while the impacts of existing and planned reservoirs and other anthropogenic activities on floods and droughts need to be further examined by future studies the analyses of droughts and pluvials in this study are based on spi3 ssi3 and sri3 which represent the dry and wet conditions at the seasonal scale and we also examine the daily discharge to analyze floods when analyzing the hydroclimatic extremes and drought pluvial seesaws it s important to keep in mind the time scale of concern the droughts pluvial and drought pluvial seesaws at shorter time scales e g flash drought are not considered in this study which can be examined by future studies 5 conclusions in this study the future changes in annual runoff and hydroclimatic extremes in the uyrb were analyzed based on the simulation results from the physically based hydrological model gbehm driven by the bias corrected cmip6 data under three emission scenarios according to the results the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the increases in annual et during the future period compared with the historical average level are expected to be larger than those of annual p in most sub regions of the uyrb as a result the annual runoff volume in the uyrb in the future period 2021 2070 will decrease by 20 4 ssp1 2 6 17 7 ssp2 4 5 and 22 0 ssp5 8 5 billion m3 relative to the historical period 1961 2020 2 the future changes in meteorological droughts identified by spi3 show a spatial pattern of alleviation in the northwest and exacerbation in the southeast while the agricultural drought severity identified by ssi3 tends to increase in all sub regions which is more severe than the meteorological droughts wujiang above wulong station is going to experience the largest increase in drought severity among the sub regions averaged across the uyrb the unprecedented agricultural droughts and pluvials will occur more than once per decade on average in the future 3 the design floods at all major hydrological stations in the uyrb are projected to increase in the future at yichang station the discharge of 100 year flood will increase by 45 7 ssp1 2 6 27 9 ssp2 4 5 and 51 5 ssp5 8 5 there will be more frequent drought pluvial seesaws identified by sri3 at all hydrological stations in the future uyrb with the largest increases at gaochang station in mintuojiang the findings of this study provide insights into water resources management in the uyrb in a warming future climate and highlight the importance of adaptive measures to tackle the elevated risk of future water shortage and more

2701,the upper yangtze river basin uyrb provides almost half of the total runoff volume of the entire yangtze river and is of great importance for the population living in the upstream and downstream regions the recent streamflow decline and more frequent hydroclimatic extremes have raised concerns about the water sustainability and water security of the uyrb in a changing climate here we examine the hydrological changes in the uyrb during the historical period 1961 2020 and the future period 2021 2070 using a physically based hydrological model based on the simulation results the future changes in water resources and hydroclimatic extremes in the uyrb were analyzed the results show that the mean annual runoff volume in the uyrb during the future period will further decrease by 20 4 ssp1 2 6 17 7 ssp2 4 5 and 22 0 ssp5 8 5 billion m3 compared with the historical mean value the agricultural drought severity will increase in all sub regions which tends to be more severe than the meteorological droughts and wujiang is going to experience the largest increase in drought severity averaged across the uyrb the unprecedented agricultural droughts and pluvials will occur more than once per decade on average in the future indicating that the most extreme events in the historical period would become the new normal in the future the design floods with different return periods at all major hydrological stations in the uyrb are projected to increase and in the future there will be more frequent drought pluvial seesaws at the major hydrological stations these findings highlight the importance of adaptive water resources management to tackle the elevated risk of water shortage and more frequent and severe hydroclimatic extremes in the future uyrb keywords upper yangtze river

longest river in china and the third longest river in the world jiao et al 2020 the upper yangtze river basin uyrb refers to the catchment upstream of the yichang hydrological station which covers more than 50 of the total area and contributes almost 50 of the total runoff of the entire yangtze river basin gao et al 2012 shi et al 2022a numerous hydropower projects have been constructed in the uyrb since the 1950 s including the world s largest hydropower plant to date the three gorges dam qin et al 2022 shi et al 2022a due to the combined effects of climate change and human activities a significant decrease in annual streamflow has been reported in the uyrb in the past few decades constraining the socio economic development of the region including the densely populated chengdu chongqing economic circle shi et al 2022a yang et al 2015b zhao et al 2015 in the context of climate change the future hydrological change in the uyrb is of great importance to the operation of hydropower plants and the large population living in the upstream and downstream regions many studies have attempted to project the future changes in annual runoff in the uyrb combining the future climate data from coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 models and different hydrological models previous studies expected the future runoff in the uyrb to increase su et al 2017 wen et al 2020 zhong et al 2020 decrease huang et al 2021 wang et al 2019b and increase or decrease depending on emission scenarios chen et al 2017 wu et al 2021 based on the future climate data from the latest coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 cmip6 models qin et al 2022 adopted the soil and water assessment tool swat model and expected increases in future streamflow in the uyrb zhao et al 2022 adopted variable infiltration capacity vic model and found that the river runoff would decrease in the future due to larger increases in evapotranspiration et compared with increases in precipitation p causing declines in hydropower generation the existing understanding of the future changes in annual runoff of the uyrb remains uncertain due to the selection of input data and hydrological models moreover the uyrb is largely affected by permafrost and seasonally frozen ground especially in the source region of the yangtze river sryr upstream of zhimenda station where almost 80 of the area is underlain by permafrost shi et al 2020 zou et al 2017 the models adopted by previous studies cannot well depict the cryospheric hydrological processes which might hinder the accurate projection of future water resources in the uyrb besides the changes in annual runoff the hydroclimatic extreme events i e droughts and floods also change in a warming climate stevenson et al 2022 flood hazards are projected to increase in many regions of the world which put more population at risk and lead to increased economic damages due to economic growth merz et al 2021 tellman et al 2021 unprecedented droughts will occur in the future and the extreme conditions in the historical period might become the new normal satoh et al 2022 stevenson et al 2022 the uyrb is a region vulnerable to droughts and floods the 2009 2010 drought in the uyrb and southwest china was a once in a century drought event which caused severe adverse impacts on water supply vegetation growth and human society li et al 2019 xu et al 2015 the uyrb has also experienced numerous destructive floods throughout history which jeopardize the safety of dams and the lives and properties of the people fang et al 2018 therefore it s imperative to assess the risk of droughts and floods in the uyrb under climate change to provide insights for adaptive water resources management some studies have already evaluated the future changes in hydroclimatic extremes in the uyrb huang et al 2021 wen et al 2020 wu et al 2021 but the spatio temporal characteristics of changes in droughts and pluvials remain largely unknown in addition to the assessment of drought and pluvials separately a type of temporally compounding event drought pluvial seesaw or drought flood alternation has raised rising concerns recently he and sheffield 2020 zscheischler et al 2020 a well known example is the multi year intense drought in california during 2011 2016 followed by large scale pluvial events which triggered the failure of the oroville dam s primary spillway swain et al 2018 wang et al 2017 the drought to deluge transition can also occur at the seasonal scale which might exert extra stress on vegetation growth shi et al 2022b in the yangtze river basin previous studies focused more on the drought flood alternation in the middle and lower yangtze river shan et al 2018 recently yang et al 2022 examined the drought pluvial seesaws in the entire yangtze river basin during 1961 2015 and linked the occurrence of the alternation to teleconnection factors but they only used precipitation to identify the seesaw events the soil moisture condition and river discharge are more direct factors that influence agriculture and water resources management but the spatial patterns and future changes of drought pluvial seesaws in terms of soil moisture condition and river discharge in the uyrb remain elusive to fill the existing knowledge gap this study attempts to examine the spatio temporal changes in annual runoff and hydroclimatic extremes during the future 50 years 2021 2070 compared with the historical period 1961 2020 across the uyrb based on the simulation results from a physically based hydrological model the objectives of this study are to i reveal the future possible changes in annual runoff in different sub regions of the uyrb ii examine the future changes in meteorological and agricultural droughts pluvials and drought pluvial seesaws at the gridded scale and iii assess the future changes in hydrological droughts and floods at different hydrological stations in the uyrb 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the uyrb is located at elevations ranging from 38 m a s l in the east chengdu plain to 7500 m a s l in the west sryr located in the northeastern tibetan plateau fig 1 shi et al 2022a the outlet of the uyrb yichang station is about 40 km downstream of the three gorges dam the entire uyrb can be divided into eight sub regions including four sub regions in the main stream i e the catchment above zhimenda sryr zhimenda shigu shigu pingshan pingshan yichang and four tributaries i e the catchment above luning yalongjiang gaochang mintuojiang beibei jialingjiang and wulong wujiang fig 1 the mean annual air temperature maat and mean annual p generally increases from west to east with the largest mean annual p exceeding 1600 mm located in the central uyrb where the terrain drastically changes from mountain to plain fig s1a b 2 2 simulation of historical and future hydrological changes 2 2 1 brief introduction to the physically based hydrological model the geomorphology based ecohydrological model gbehm was adopted by this study to simulate the hydrological changes in the uyrb during the historical period 1961 2020 and the future period 2021 2070 the gbehm is a physically based distributed hydrological model that uses hillslope valley units to effectively depict the runoff generation and river routing processes gao et al 2018 yang et al 2015a compared with its predecessor the geomorphology based hydrological model gbhm yang et al 1998 yang et al 2002 the improvements of gbehm include i the simple biosphere model sib2 was used to estimate et gao et al 2016 and a dynamic vegetation module was added to simulate the climate driven vegetation changes based on the coupled water carbon processes shi et al 2022a ii an energy balance module was added which could consider the soil freeze thaw and other cryospheric hydrological processes in the cold regions and enable the simulation of coupled water heat dynamics gao et al 2018 more details of gbehm can be found in yang et al 2015a and gao et al 2018 due to these features the gbehm has been successfully applied to simulate the hydrological processes in many cold regions including the upper heihe river basin gao et al 2018 the upper yellow river basin qin et al 2017 and the uyrb shi et al 2022a the model runs at an hourly time step with a spatial resolution of 8 km and the model settings for the historical period 1961 2020 simulation in this study are the same as those in shi et al 2022a more details about the input data including historical meteorological soil elevation and vegetation data can be found in shi et al 2022a the simulation results have proved to reflect the spatio temporal variations of water balance components in different sub regions of the uyrb reasonably well shi et al 2022a here we attempt to extend the simulation period and use the model to project the hydrological changes during the future period in the uyrb 2 2 2 future projections based on the cmip6 data in order to simulate the hydrological changes in the future period 2021 2070 this study collected the meteorological output from five cmip6 models during the historical and future period eyring et al 2016 the five models including bcc csm2 mr mri esm2 0 ipsl cm6a lr cnrm esm2 1 and ec earth3 table 1 were selected because they were found to perform relatively well in the uyrb jiang et al 2020 li et al 2021 cmip6 models define the combinations of shared socioeconomic pathways ssps and representative concentration pathways rcps o neill et al 2016 and we select the ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios representing the low end medium road and high end of the range of future pathways respectively the quantile delta mapping method qdm was adopted for bias correction of the meteorological output from the cmip6 models cannon et al 2015 lange 2019 first for a specific meteorological variable the cumulative distribution function cdf of the historical observations historical data from cmip6 models and future data from cmip6 models were calculated at each grid box for each month of the year denoted by f1 x f2 x f3 x respectively second for a future value to be corrected from the cmip6 models xsim fut we calculated its cumulative probability f3 xsim fut and found the corresponding values in historical observations f1 1 f3 xsim fut and historical cmip6 data f2 1 f3 xsim fut the bias corrected future value xsim fut cor was then calculated by either of the following two equations 1 x sim f u t c o r f 1 1 f 3 x sim f u t x sim f u t f 2 1 f 3 x sim f u t 2 x sim f u t c o r f 1 1 f 3 x sim f u t x sim f u t f 2 1 f 3 x sim f u t for the variables that need to consider the absolute changes like air temperature eq 1 was selected for bias correction for variables that need to consider the relative changes like precipitation and wind speed eq 2 was adopted for bias correction bias correction was applied at the spatial scale of the gcm output then the corrected values were spatially downscaled to a finer scale 8 km as required by the hydrological model using the method described by wang et al 2018b the future changes in maat and annual p in the uyrb under three climate scenarios after bias correction and downscaling are shown in fig 2 a b the bias corrected and downscaled meteorological variables from cmip6 models were then adopted as the input data of gbehm for future simulation 2 3 identification of droughts and pluvials at gridded scale in this study we evaluate the droughts and pluvials in the uyrb both at the gridded scale based on precipitation and soil moisture conditions and at the hydrological stations based on the river discharge data this section will first introduce the methods for identifying droughts and pluvials at the gridded scale we consider two standardized metrics which allow comparisons over time and space as proxies of drought and pluvial conditions from both the meteorological and agricultural perspectives the first one is the standardized precipitation index over a 3 month period spi3 qin et al 2015 xu et al 2015 the precipitation data can be fitted by a gamma probability density function g x with the cumulative distribution function g x at each grid box for each month of the year 3 g x 1 b a γ a x a 1 e x b f o r x 0 4 g x 1 b a γ a 0 x x a 1 e x b d x f o r x 0 where x is the cumulative precipitation in 3 months a and b are the shape and scale parameter respectively which can be estimated by the maximum likelihood method xu et al 2015 let t x b and eq 4 can be transformed into an incomplete gamma function farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 qin et al 2015 5 g x 1 γ a 0 x t a 1 e t d t there are extreme situations when cumulative precipitation x 0 as a result the equation is then modified as 6 h x q 1 q g x where q is the probability of x 0 estimated by the occurrence frequency of x 0 in the entire observation series finally the spi value is obtained by transforming h to the standard normal distribution 7 spi φ 1 h where φ is the standard normal distribution compared with precipitation soil moisture is a more direct variable that affects vegetation growth similarly we calculate the standardized soil moisture index over a 3 month period ssi3 farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 the calculation process of ssi3 is similar to that of spi3 the only difference is that the xin eqs 3 5 now changes to 3 month mean soil moisture content from the simulation results of gbehm at 5 cm depth it should be noted that when determining the parameters in eqs 3 5 only the precipitation or soil moisture data during historical period 1961 2020 are adopted when spi3 or ssi3 at a grid cell is below 1 0 or above 1 0 the drought and pluvial conditions are identified he and sheffield 2020 we refer to the droughts pluvials identified by spi3 and ssi3 as meteorological and agricultural droughts pluvials respectively if spi3 or ssi3 keeps below 1 0 above 1 0 for consecutive months we define the number of months as the duration of a certain drought pluvial event and the dimensionless cumulative area of spi3 or ssi3 values below 1 0 above 1 0 as the drought pluvial severity hong et al 2015 fig s2 the total number of months in the state of drought pluvial is calculated by the sum of duration of all the drought pluvial events during a certain time period e g a decade and termed as time in drought pluvial if the following pluvial drought event has a start date that is within three months of the end date of the preceding drought pluvial event then we define this phenomenon as a drought pluvial seesaw event he and sheffield 2020 fig s2 a drought pluvial seesaw indicates that precipitation or soil moisture shifts from drier wetter than normal to wetter drier than normal within three months here we also define unprecedented droughts and pluvials for each grid box we can obtain a drought pluvial event that has the largest severity in the historical period if the severity of drought pluvial events in the future exceeds the most severe one in the historical period we call them unprecedented droughts pluvials in the following sections the figures and tables for the drought and pluvial indictors will show the mean value of the simulation results based on the meteorological output of five cmip6 models 2 4 calculation of hydrological droughts and floods at hydrological stations similar to the calculation of spi3 and ssi3 that represents the drought and pluvial conditions of precipitation and soil moisture we use the standardized runoff index over a 3 month period sri3 hong et al 2015 shukla and wood 2008 to represent the dry and wet conditions of streamflow the x in eqs 3 5 now changes to the 3 month cumulative runoff volume from the simulation results of gbehm at each hydrological station in the uyrb in this study the thresholds 1 0 and 1 0 were selected to identify the hydrological droughts and pluvials the definition of drought pluvial duration severity drought pluvial seesaw and unprecedented droughts pluvials are the same as the introduction in section 2 3 in addition to the hydrological pluvials identified by sri3 which reflect wetter than normal conditions at the seasonal scale we are also concerned about the floods at shorter time scales which can cause detrimental hazards from the daily discharge derived from gbehm at each hydrological station the peak over threshold pot method is adopted to retrieve the flood events tang and carey 2017 yang et al 2019 the threshold is set to be two which means that there would be a total of about 120 flood events retrieved in the historical period two events per year on average for the 60 year historical period based on the peak discharge of the retrieved flood events in the historical and future period the design floods with different return periods 10 years 20 years 50 years 100 years can be calculated by fitting the peak discharge to certain probability distribution functions with the help of a matlab toolbox called mvcat sadegh et al 2017 the candidate distribution functions provided by mvcat include generalized extreme value inverse gaussian birnbaum saunders lognormal gamma loglogistic nakagami rician normal logistic t location scale weibull extreme value rayleigh exponential and generalized pareto the parameters are estimated by maximum likelihood method and the distribution with the minimum bayesian information criterion bic is selected for fitting the peak discharge when identifying unprecedented pluvials in the future in addition to the method by sri3 as described before method 1 we also adopted an alternative method if the peak discharge of the retrieved flood events exceeds the historical maximum peak discharge we also define this future flood event as an unprecedented flood method 2 the two methods differ in terms of the time scale in addition we also calculate q95 and q5 from daily discharge data to examine the changes in the flow regime q95 and q5 represent the daily discharge that 95 and 5 of the flow records within a year exceed which are commonly used to represent low flow and high flow respectively huang et al 2021 wang et al 2019b 3 results 3 1 future changes in water balance and runoff volume the inter annual changes of maat p et and runoff depth r with the unit of mm in the uyrb are shown in fig 2 for visual clarity the three year moving average values are shown the maat in the future 2021 2070 is projected to increase by 1 67 c ssp1 2 6 1 83 c ssp2 4 5 and 2 40 c ssp5 8 5 relative to the average level during the historical period 1961 2020 with larger increases under more severe emission scenarios in comparison the future changes in the water balance components p et and r are not expected to vary much among the three scenarios the mean annual p during the future period is expected to increase by 27 2 mm ssp1 2 6 24 5 mm ssp2 4 5 and 34 1 mm ssp5 8 5 compared with the historical period but this increase is not able to compensate the increase in water consumption by et in a warmer future climate the increase in annual et is expected to be larger than that of annual p which is as much as 51 9 mm ssp1 2 6 46 0 mm ssp2 4 5 and 60 4 mm ssp5 8 5 respectively as a result the annual r in the uyrb will decrease by 21 4 mm ssp1 2 6 18 6 mm ssp2 4 5 and 23 0 mm ssp5 8 5 in the future relative to the historical average value fig 2 table 2 the future changes in water balance components in different sub regions of the uyrb during 2021 2070 relative to the average value during the historical period 1961 2020 are shown in table 2 it can be seen that the future annual p is expected to increase in all sub regions of the uyrb the largest increases will occur in the sryr above zhimenda where the mean annual p during the future period is expected to increase by 41 1 mm ssp1 2 6 40 5 mm ssp2 4 5 and 62 8 mm ssp5 8 5 compared with the historical average value the annual et is also expected to increase in all sub regions with the largest increases in wujiang above wulong where the future annual et is expected to increase by 94 9 mm ssp1 2 6 80 5 mm ssp2 4 5 and 99 1 mm ssp5 8 5 compared with the historical average value due to the generally larger increases of future annual et than those of future annual p the future annual r is expected to decrease in all sub regions of the uyrb except sryr above zhimenda and mintuojiang above gaochang the most dramatic decreases will occur in wujiang above wulong where the mean annual r during the future period is expected to decline by 87 3 mm ssp1 2 6 87 7 mm ssp2 4 5 and 95 7 mm ssp5 8 5 compared with the historical average value the changes in water resources indicated by runoff volume q with the unit of m3 at different hydrological stations are also calculated and shown in fig 3 for the five hydrological stations along the main stream shown as the first five subplots in fig 3 only the q at the most upstream station zhimenda is expected to increase in the future compared with the historical period while the q will decline at all other four stations at pingshan station the future mean annual q will decrease by 4 9 ssp1 2 6 5 0 ssp2 4 5 and 8 0 ssp5 8 5 billion m3 while at yichang station the annual q will decrease by 20 4 ssp1 2 6 17 7 ssp2 4 5 and 22 0 ssp5 8 5 billion m3 compared with the historical average value the decline in water resources at yichang station not only results from the q decline in the main stream but also from the q decline in the tributaries especially in wujiang above wulong where the annual q will decline by 7 1 ssp1 2 6 7 2 ssp2 4 5 and 7 9 ssp5 8 5 billion m3 in the future relative to the historical period the q decline in wujiang above wulong nearly contributes one third of the total q decline of the entire uyrb fig 3 3 2 future changes in meteorological and agricultural droughts and pluvials drought spatial features including time in drought and drought severity from spi3 and ssi3 in the historical period are shown in fig s3 in the future the time in drought and drought severity identified by spi3 show clear spatial patterns alleviated droughts in the northwest and exacerbated droughts in the southeast fig 4 a c the spatial patterns of future changes in agricultural droughts however are quite different fig 4b d the agricultural droughts will exacerbate in all sub regions regardless of the different changing directions of meteorological droughts table 3 wujiang above wulong is expected to experience the largest increases in agricultural drought severity where the meteorological drought severity increases are also the largest among the sub regions mintuojiang above gaochang is expected to experience the second largest increase in agricultural drought severity although the meteorological droughts in mintuojiang will change little in the future table 3 fig 4 we also calculate the time in pluvial and pluvial severity from spi3 and ssi3 and the spatial patterns during the historical period are shown in fig s4 in the future the time in pluvial and pluvial severity will increase in all sub regions of the uyrb except wujiang above wulong where the time in pluvial and pluvial severity identified by ssi3 show slight decreases fig 5 table 3 the results indicate that most regions in the uyrb will experience increased time and larger severity in meteorological and agricultural pluvials compared with the historical period especially in the northwestern uyrb fig 5 given the future increases in drought and pluvial severity identified by spi3 and ssi3 in the uyrb we further examine whether and how often the unprecedented droughts and pluvials will occur in the future which exceed the most severe drought and pluvial in the historical period according to our estimates the unprecedented agricultural droughts and pluvials will occur more often than the unprecedented meteorological droughts and pluvials fig 6 averaged across the uyrb the unprecedented agricultural droughts and pluvials will occur about 1 0 and 1 5 times per decade indicating that the hydroclimatic extremes that never happen in the historical 60 years will become the new normal as they will happen more than once for each decade on average in the future table 4 in some regions of the mintuojiang and wujiang the unprecedented droughts and pluvials identified by ssi3 will even occur more than twice per decade in the future period fig 6 table 4 we also examine the spatial patterns and future changes of drought pluvial seesaws the spatial patterns of the historical mean occurrence frequency of drought pluvial seesaws identified by spi3 and ssi3 are shown in fig 7 a b the hotspots of drought pluvial seesaws are mainly located in the mintuojiang and the main stream regions near cuntan and yichang the frequency of drought pluvial seesaws identified by ssi3 is lower than that identified by spi3 fig 7a b the frequency changes of drought pluvial seesaws in the future relative to the historical period are shown in fig 7c d the concurrent increases in future drought and pluvial severity are likely to increase future drought pluvial seesaw frequency identified by spi3 in the southeastern uyrb while the different changing directions in future drought and pluvial severity tend to cause no changes or decreases in future drought pluvial seesaw frequency identified by spi3 in the northwestern uyrb fig 4c 5c 7c as for the future changes in drought pluvial seesaws identified by ssi3 nearly all sub regions will experience increases and the largest increases occur in mintuojiang above gaochang where both future agricultural drought and pluvial severity are expected to increase table 3 averaged across the uyrb the seesaw frequency will increase by 0 6 and 2 1 times per decade in the future under the ssp5 8 5 scenario respectively identified by spi3 and ssi3 fig 7 table 3 3 3 future changes in hydrological droughts and floods we have examined the meteorological and agricultural droughts and pluvials using spi3 and ssi3 at the gridded scale and in this section we will examine the hydrological droughts and pluvials at the major hydrological stations identified by sri3 the future changes in time in drought drought severity time in pluvial pluvial severity and drought pluvial seesaw frequency are shown in table 5 the drought severity will increase at all hydrological stations under three climate scenarios and the largest increase will occur at wulong station wujiang table 5 we also examine the q95 low flow changes at different stations and the q95 at wulong station is expected to decrease significantly also suggesting exacerbated future risk of hydrological droughts at wujiang fig 8 unprecedented hydrological droughts will occur 2 7 ssp1 2 6 2 1 ssp2 4 5 and 2 5 ssp5 8 5 times per decade in the future period at wulong station table 6 while for the yichang station unprecedented hydrological droughts will occur 1 6 ssp1 2 6 1 7 ssp2 4 5 and 1 6 ssp5 8 5 times per decade on average in the future table 6 the time in pluvial and pluvial severity identified by sri3 will also increase at all stations in the uyrb except wulong indicating that the hydrological stations will experience increased time and larger severity in droughts and pluvials at the same time in the future period table 5 as a result the drought pluvial seesaw frequency identified by sri3 is expected to increase at all hydrological stations in the future with the largest increase at gaochang station mintuojiang for the yichang station the hydrological drought pluvial seesaw frequency will increase by 4 8 ssp1 2 6 3 3 ssp2 4 5 and 3 9 ssp5 8 5 times per decade on average in the future compared with the mean value during the historical period table 5 the results indicate that in the future the hydrological stations in the uyrb will face more frequent transitions between drier than normal and wetter than normal conditions in addition to the hydrological pluvials identified by sri3 which reflect the wetter than normal condition at the seasonal scale we also examine the flood changes at the daily scale using the daily discharge derived from the hydrological model the percentage changes of the design floods with different return periods in the future relative to the historical period are shown in table 7 it can be seen that the design floods at all stations with all return periods are projected to increase and larger percentage increases are generally expected for longer return periods at yichang station the discharge of 100 year flood will increase by 45 7 ssp1 2 6 27 9 ssp2 4 5 and 51 5 ssp5 8 5 in the future table 7 we calculate the future occurrence frequency of unprecedented pluvials respectively using sri3 method 1 and the daily peak discharge method 2 table 6 the results show that using sri3 the yichang station will experience 1 1 ssp1 2 6 0 9 ssp2 4 5 and 1 2 ssp5 8 5 unprecedented pluvials per decade on average in the future however there will be nearly no unprecedented floods at yichang station in the future using method 2 when using method 2 gaochang mintuojiang is expected to have the most unprecedented pluvials in the future this can also be reflected in the temporal changes of q5 high flow as the value of q5 shows an increasing trend in the future while the maximum value in the historical period is relatively low at gaochang station making the unprecedented floods relatively easy to happen in the future fig s5 4 discussion previous studies have shown that the annual runoff volume in the uyrb declined by 36 6 billion m3 from 1961 to 2015 which has raised concerns about the water sustainability and water security in the region especially for mintuojiang and jialingjiang where the megacities chengdu and chongqing are located shi et al 2022a the results of this study show that the average annual runoff volume in the future period 2021 2070 will further decrease by 20 4 ssp1 2 6 17 7 ssp2 4 5 and 22 0 ssp5 8 5 billion m3 for the entire uyrb compared with the historical average level during 1961 2020 although the annual p will increase in all sub regions the annual et is expected to increase by a larger proportion leading to future declines in water resources table 2 fig 3 our findings are similar to the results of previous studies huang et al 2021 wang et al 2019b zhao et al 2022 showing declining annual runoff in a warmer future uyrb which may exacerbate the water stress in the densely populated regions the possible declines in runoff volume could also affect hydropower generation negatively and threaten the rising electricity demands due to rapid urbanization and industrial development the meteorological and agricultural drought features including time in drought and drought severity have been identified by spi3 and ssi3 across the uyrb respectively the results show more severe exacerbation in agricultural drought than meteorological drought since the meteorological droughts show a spatial pattern of alleviation in the northwest and exacerbation in the southeast but the agricultural drought severity tends to increase in all sub regions fig 4 table 3 the possible reason is that the soil moisture conditions are affected not only by precipitation but also by air temperature qin et al 2015 xu et al 2015 likewise the spatial pattern of changes in future meteorological and agricultural pluvials are also different fig 5 table 3 since soil moisture is a more direct variable that affects vegetation growth spi3 might be not sufficient to reflect the water condition changes for ecosystem health and agricultural purposes and the indicators reflecting the effects of warming like ssi3 and standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei might be more appropriate in the context of climate change xu et al 2015 it should be noted that the above results are based on the mean value of the simulation results derived from five cmip6 models and there can be differences among the models to assess the uncertainty in projecting the future drought and pluvial indicators we show the consistency of five cmip6 models in projecting the future changing directions of the indicators fig s6 and fig s7 corresponding to fig 4 and fig 5 respectively we find that the future changing directions from different models are consistent in most regions of the uyrb and the changes identified by ssi3 generally show greater consistency among models than those identified by spi3 fig s6 s7 climate change could make the hydroclimatic extremes in the historical period become the new normal in the future stevenson et al 2022 here we show that the unprecedented droughts and pluvials exceeding the historical most severe ones would happen in the future uyrb and the frequency can be quite high in some sub regions averaged across the uyrb the unprecedented agricultural droughts and pluvials will occur more than once per decade on average in the future fig 6 table 4 we also find that the unprecedented hydrological droughts will occur about 1 6 times per decade in the future at the yichang station table 6 for the unprecedented pluvials at hydrological stations we use both sri3 and daily peak discharge to identify the occurrence frequency which represent different time scales of concern table 6 both unprecedented hydrological droughts and pluvials will occur frequently at gaochang station in the future table 6 which is consistent with the frequent occurrence of both unprecedented agricultural droughts and pluvials in mintuojiang above gaochang fig 6 table 4 although the annual runoff volume at gaochang will change little specifically we examine a type of temporally compounding event drought pluvial seesaws which represent the rapid transition between drier than normal conditions and wetter than normal conditions by using spi3 ssi3 and sri3 we only focus on the transitions between the droughts and pluvials at the seasonal or longer time scale which could largely affect the agriculture ecosystem and human society during the historical period the occurrence frequency of drought pluvial seesaws identified by ssi3 is lower than that identified by spi3 possibly since the soil moisture takes a longer time to respond to the precipitation dry wet or wet dry alternation fig 7a b in contrast the future seesaw frequency identified by ssi3 will increase more than that identified by spi3 averaged across the uyrb table 3 fig 7c d the possible mechanism is that the larger vapor pressure deficit due to rising temperature could enhance evaporation and accelerate the depletion of soil moisture gu et al 2022 qing et al 2022 yuan et al 2019 leading to more rapid formation of agricultural droughts and more frequent transitions between agricultural droughts and pluvials the increased drought pluvial alternation might put extra stress on vegetation growth shi et al 2022b which needs to be further examined by future research previous studies focus more on the drought flood alternation in the middle and lower yangtze river shan et al 2018 while this study finds that there will be more frequent drought pluvial seesaws identified by sri3 at all hydrological stations in the future uyrb table 5 the increased climate volatility might be the reason for the intensified hydrological cycle he and sheffield 2020 the increases in drought pluvial seesaw frequency along with the considerable increases in design floods with different return periods at all hydrological stations table 7 bring unprecedented threats and challenges to the operation and management of the numerous hydropower plants across the uyrb here we take a closer look at the sryr which is largely underlain by permafrost which is part of the sanjiangyuan nature reserve and serves as an important ecological barrier and a unique shelter for wildlife wang et al 2018a the future projections of this study have already included the effects of potential permafrost degradation since gbehm has the energy balance module to simulate frozen ground changes and coupled water heat dynamics gao et al 2018 shi et al 2020 we find that although the meteorological droughts in the sryr will be alleviated the agricultural droughts however will be exacerbated in the future fig 4 table 3 besides the increased air temperature that is true for the entire uyrb permafrost degradation might be another reason for this discrepancy in the sryr the existence of permafrost prevents the water from moving downward and constrains soil water within the active layer the seasonally freeze thaw layer above permafrost in a warming future climate the active layer will thicken and permafrost will finally completely thaw wang et al 2019a wang et al 2020 zhang et al 2022 these changes could enhance infiltration lead to surface soil desiccation and enhance drought severity identified by ssi3 the shallow rooted vegetation on the tibetan plateau will find it harder to obtain soil moisture which may lead to grassland degradation and desertification and has to be paid more attention to in a warming climate jin et al 2022 teufel and sushama 2019 the permafrost degradation induced infiltration will also increase groundwater flow and baseflow gao et al 2018 wang et al 2018a which is also reflected by the estimated increasing trends of q95 low flow at zhimenda and shigu in the historical and future period fig 8 it should be noted that the analyses of this study are based on the simulation results from the physically based model gbehm although the model has made considerable improvements in depicting the cryospheric hydrological and vegetation related processes the impacts of direct human activities like reservoir operation and human water consumption have not been included yet in other words the results of this study only reflect the climate driven future changes in water resources and hydroclimatic extremes in the uyrb our findings highlight the necessity of adaptive water resources management in response to less annual runoff and more severe hydroclimatic extremes in the future uyrb while the impacts of existing and planned reservoirs and other anthropogenic activities on floods and droughts need to be further examined by future studies the analyses of droughts and pluvials in this study are based on spi3 ssi3 and sri3 which represent the dry and wet conditions at the seasonal scale and we also examine the daily discharge to analyze floods when analyzing the hydroclimatic extremes and drought pluvial seesaws it s important to keep in mind the time scale of concern the droughts pluvial and drought pluvial seesaws at shorter time scales e g flash drought are not considered in this study which can be examined by future studies 5 conclusions in this study the future changes in annual runoff and hydroclimatic extremes in the uyrb were analyzed based on the simulation results from the physically based hydrological model gbehm driven by the bias corrected cmip6 data under three emission scenarios according to the results the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the increases in annual et during the future period compared with the historical average level are expected to be larger than those of annual p in most sub regions of the uyrb as a result the annual runoff volume in the uyrb in the future period 2021 2070 will decrease by 20 4 ssp1 2 6 17 7 ssp2 4 5 and 22 0 ssp5 8 5 billion m3 relative to the historical period 1961 2020 2 the future changes in meteorological droughts identified by spi3 show a spatial pattern of alleviation in the northwest and exacerbation in the southeast while the agricultural drought severity identified by ssi3 tends to increase in all sub regions which is more severe than the meteorological droughts wujiang above wulong station is going to experience the largest increase in drought severity among the sub regions averaged across the uyrb the unprecedented agricultural droughts and pluvials will occur more than once per decade on average in the future 3 the design floods at all major hydrological stations in the uyrb are projected to increase in the future at yichang station the discharge of 100 year flood will increase by 45 7 ssp1 2 6 27 9 ssp2 4 5 and 51 5 ssp5 8 5 there will be more frequent drought pluvial seesaws identified by sri3 at all hydrological stations in the future uyrb with the largest increases at gaochang station in mintuojiang the findings of this study provide insights into water resources management in the uyrb in a warming future climate and highlight the importance of adaptive measures to tackle the elevated risk of future water shortage and more

2702,land evapotranspiration et is a key factor in the hydrological cycle and is particularly sensitive to climate change in the past few decades the pan arctic region has witnessed a strong warming trend causing substantial changes in ground surface conditions however it remains poorly understood how et varies across such a region here we investigated the spatial temporal changes in et over six large pan arctic river basins using corrected et estimates from gleam and era5 land during 1981 2020 the 40 year mean annual et in the ob yenisei lena kolyma yukon and mackenzie river basins were approximately 366 mm yr 1 271 mm yr 1 228 mm yr 1 239 mm yr 1 278 mm yr 1 and 295 mm yr 1 respectively climatologically permafrost dominated basins tend to have lower et than those with less permafrost temporally the annual et in permafrost dominated basins has increased faster than that in less permafrost developed basins over the past four decades this increase is particularly prominent in the kolyma river basin completely covered by permafrost where the significant trend in et 7 5 mm decade 1 p 0 001 is the highest among the six basins further analyses show that intensified permafrost thawing is likely the key factor contributing to increased et in permafrost dominated basins as seen from the positive relationship between the thickening in the active layer alt and the change in et under an amplified warming background et in permafrost dominated regions is expected to continue to increase the results reported in this study improve our understanding of the variations in et and the associated mechanisms in the changing arctic keywords evapotranspiration trend climate warming permafrost degradation pan arctic data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction land surface evapotranspiration et is the water transferred from the land surface and plants to the atmosphere and is the second largest component of the global water cycle following precipitation fisher et al 2017 jung et al 2010 additionally land surface et is a key nexus process in the global water energy carbon cycle teuling et al 2009 on the global scale land surface et returns approximately 59 68 of land precipitation to the atmosphere ma et al 2021 oki and kanae 2006 zhang et al 2016 recent studies have estimated that the hydrological cycle has intensified at a rate of approximately 4 c durack et al 2012 skliris et al 2016 with increasing total precipitation feng et al 2019 and precipitation extremes papalexiou and montanari 2019 consequently global et may increase as a result of global warming and increasing precipitation allan et al 2020 ma et al 2021 wang et al 2022b et is one of the most uncertain components of the water budget rodell et al 2011 wang and dickinson 2012 yoon et al 2019 at both global miralles et al 2016 mueller and seneviratne 2014 zhang et al 2019 and regional jung et al 2019 long et al 2014 scales due to the inherent weaknesses of models cai et al 2014 li et al 2009 yuan et al 2020 and the sparse and short time recorded site observations ma et al 2020a ma and zhang 2022 mueller et al 2011 to reduce the uncertainties in et estimates the advancement of satellite remote sensing has greatly promoted the development of et models such as machine learning models carter and liang 2019 zhao et al 2019 land surface models ma et al 2020b zeng and cai 2018 data assimilation models cui and jia 2021 rodell et al 2004 and satellite remote sensing based models chen and liu 2020 mu et al 2011 yielding several free regional or global et products among et products the global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam dataset and the european centre for medium range weather forecasts reanalysis v5 land era5 land data are available on longer time scales than most other datasets gleam is a semiempirical model that estimates et and its individual components miralles et al 2011b talsma et al 2018 suggested that gleam is robust in relation to errors in forcing data and provides more accurate transpiration than the penman monteith model monteith 1965 penman 1948 and priestley taylor model priestley and taylor 1972 nevertheless chen et al 2022 found that gleam tended to underestimate soil evaporation era5 land et has also been studied on the basin and global scales crowhurst et al 2021 li et al 2022 and it showed lower uncertainty than the other products over 0 1 accordingly there are still uncertainties associated with gleam and era5 land et therefore the et products need to be corrected for further analysis the water balance method is widely used to calculate et in different regions fu et al 2022 liu et al 2016 lv et al 2017 wan et al 2015 and it is usually regarded as the most reliable way to estimate evapotranspiration at the basin scale ma et al 2019 the arctic plays an important role in affecting global terrestrial water cycles and is experiencing an abrupt and sustained period of climate warming jansen et al 2020 rantanen et al 2022 detected that the arctic warmed approximately four times faster than the global mean since 1979 which is considerably more rapid than the value reported in previous studies precipitation in pan arctic regions is also increasing under a warming climate bintanja et al 2020 wang et al 2021b which is partly caused by enhanced land surface et bintanja and selten 2014 an important physical feature of the pan arctic regions is the extensive distribution of permafrost i e perennially frozen ground which is a sensitive indicator of climate change ding et al 2019 french 2017 recent studies have shown that permafrost is warming globally biskaborn et al 2019 oliva and fritz 2018 romanovsky et al 2007 and warming is occurring faster than estimated vaks et al 2020 under a future warmer climate cold ice rich permafrost is expected to thaw quickly nitzbon et al 2020 leading to the rapid formation of thermokarst landslides and lakes farquharson et al 2019 lewkowicz and way 2019 it has been shown that permafrost regions experienced faster temperature warming wang et al 2022a and larger increases in precipitation wang et al 2021b than non permafrost regions across russian pan arctic regions additionally the rate of increase in runoff in the continuous permafrost dominated lena river basin is much faster than that in the non permafrost dominated ob river basin wang et al 2021a it is inferred that hydrological processes are more intense in permafrost dominated regions than in non permafrost dominated regions which is likely related to widespread permafrost thawing et in pan arctic regions experiences large spatiotemporal variations vihma et al 2016 and et changes are coupled to landscape alterations such as permafrost changes vegetation shifts fires and lake and reservoir changes bring et al 2016 liu et al 2022 wrona et al 2016 observations and estimates of et over terrestrial surfaces suffer from various errors and uncertainties in the arctic bring et al 2016 mainly attributed to short term field measurements covering some specific areas i e tundra areas langer et al 2011 recent studies on arctic et have focused on specific vegetation zones and basins han and menzel 2022 krogh and pomeroy 2019 raz yaseef et al 2017 shi et al 2022 or the evaluation of different products models or algorithms for arctic et bring et al 2019 mu et al 2009 su et al 2006 however it is not clear whether the change rate of et in permafrost dominated regions differs from that in non permafrost dominated regions to address this question six large pan arctic river basins i e ob yenisei lena kolyma yukon and mackenzie with different areal extents of permafrost were selected these basins are characterized by high discharge liu et al 2021 wang et al 2021a first we corrected the et products i e gleam and era5 land based on the water balance method to obtain the long time series et from 1981 to 2020 then we analysed the temporal changes in et for six selected river basins the main objectives of this study were therefore to 1 detect the temporal changes in et across pan arctic basins and 2 identify the potential drivers that increase et in permafrost dominated regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area six major pan arctic rivers namely the ob yenisei lena kolyma yukon and mackenzie rivers with lengths of approximately 3977 4803 4387 2091 2716 and 3679 km respectively across different permafrost zones from continuous permafrost to isolated patches amon et al 2012 holmes et al 2012 were selected for this study fig 1 the areas of the river basins are 3 03 106 2 55 106 2 48 106 0 65 106 0 83 106 and 1 74 106 km2 respectively the ob river basin is located in western siberia and contains a large number of small lakes more than 450 000 with an area of 1 km2 xu et al 2020 the region is strongly affected by human activities mainly in the form of industry and agriculture gordeev et al 2004 yang et al 2004 in addition the ob river basin is relatively warm compared with the other five river basins the annual mean temperature in the ob river basin was approximately 0 7 c during 1981 2020 the yenisei river basin contains lake baikal the most voluminous freshwater lake in the world the main anthropogenic factor influencing the hydrology of this basin is the presence of large dams utilized for hydropower generation fabre et al 2019 the lena river basin is composed of approximately 80 continuous permafrost mcclelland et al 2004 and has the largest annual river discharge among the six river basins the kolyma river basin is completely underlain by continuous permafrost mcclelland et al 2004 the yukon river basin covers northwestern canada and boreal alaska and features a long winter freezing period pan et al 2021 the mackenzie river basin whose namesake is the longest river in the arctic is characterized by large lakes that cover 10 of the drainage basin area amon et al 2012 the yukon and mackenzie river basins are much less affected by humans than the other arctic river basins of eurasia wohl et al 2022 2 2 data 2 2 1 gridded et datasets the et datasets were obtained from gleam version 3 5a martens et al 2017 miralles et al 2011a and the era5 land dataset munoz sabater et al 2021 the gleam et product v3 5a was calculated using the priestley and taylor equation driven by satellite and reanalysis data and estimates of potential evapotranspiration pet were converted into actual evaporation using a multiplicative evaporative stress factor based on observations of microwave vegetation optical depth and estimates of root zone soil moisture martens et al 2017 miralles et al 2011a gleam et at high resolution agrees well with in situ measurements martens et al 2018 the era5 land dataset is a replay of era5 climate reanalysis forced by meteorological fields from era5 and it is a state of the art global reanalysis dataset for land applications munoz sabater et al 2021 2 2 2 climatic hydrological permafrost and vegetation data gridded monthly average 2 m temperature t data and potential evapotranspiration pet data with a resolution of 0 5 were obtained from the climatic research unit cru gridded time series dataset v 4 04 harris et al 2020 gridded monthly land surface precipitation p data were obtained from the global precipitation climatology centre gpcc version 2020 at a resolution of 0 25 schneider et al 2020 daily meteorological data were obtained from the era5 land dataset which includes 2 m air temperature 2 m dewpoint temperature solar net surface radiation 10 m wind speed and soil water content 0 100 cm at a spatial resolution of 0 1 munoz sabater et al 2021 vapour pressure deficit vpd is the deficit of the saturated and actual vapour pressure which was quantified by the mean air temperature and dewpoint temperature respectively murray 1967 daily river discharge data from gauging stations during 2003 2019 were obtained from the arctic great rivers observatory arcticgro discharge dataset shiklomanov et al 2021 the terrestrial water storage anomaly twsa was obtained from the gravity recovery and climate experiment at jet propulsion laboratory grace jpl rl06 v02 watkins et al 2015 the permafrost distribution was obtained from the circum arctic map of permafrost and ground ice conditions version 2 brown et al 2002 the active layer thickness alt data for 1980 2016 were obtained from park et al 2016 the leaf area index lai was obtained from the global land surface satellite glass product liang et al 2021 xiao et al 2014 which was produced using satellite observations from the advanced very high resolution radiometer the datasets used in this study were first resampled to 0 5 resolution using the nearest neighbour method followed by aggregation into monthly and annual scales the key features of the datasets are summarized in table 1 2 3 methods 2 3 1 water balance based evapotranspiration at the basin scale at a basin scale the water balance method of employing precipitation runoff and changes in terrestrial water storage is usually regarded as a reliable way to estimate evapotranspiration ma et al 2019 this study derived the monthly water balance based evapotranspiration etwb using 1 e t p r ds d t where p is basin wide precipitation mm month r is river runoff mm month and ds d t is the change in tws mm month a similar water balance analysis was also performed at the annual scale here p was obtained from gpcc version 2020 at a resolution of 0 25 schneider et al 2020 r was obtained from gauging stations during 2002 2016 and from the arcticgro discharge dataset shiklomanov et al 2021 ds d t was calculated as the difference in successive monthly twsa values from grace note that the annual ds d t was calculated as the difference in twsa between consecutive decembers ma et al 2021 we calculated etwb during the period of 2002 2016 the et values in some months may be negative especially in winter and we replaced the negative values with new values the new values were obtained by linearly interpolating the et values for the months before and after the month in which the negative values occurred for example if the et value in march 2005 was negative the new value for march 2005 was obtained by linearly interpolating the et values in february 2005 and april 2005 2 3 2 et product correction feng et al 2021 proposed a simple and efficient correction method based on the water balance method which significantly improved regional et using etwb as the reference data we used the ratio correction method feng et al 2021 to correct the et estimates from gleam and era5 land specifically we calculated the ratio of etwb to the etmod product i e r in equation 2 for each month 2 r i e t w b i e t m o d i i 1 2 3 12 where i represents the month each basin has a single unique value of ri in each month after obtaining ri we multiplied it separately for each month of the et products during 1981 2020 the et annual value is the sum of the et for each day of the year 2 3 3 stepwise regression regression methods are statistical models that establish relationships to predict or estimate one variable as a function of other selected variables kiernan 2014 however the selected variables depend largely on a priori knowledge and occasionally the selected independent variables may not be truly independent resulting in misleading results grafen and hails 2002 stepwise regression analysis is usually used as an alternative to linear regression to perform global sensitivity analysis it is an automatic computational procedure that attempts to find the best multiple regression model using only statistically significant predictors from a larger set of potential predictive variables gagnon and barber 2018 in other words the stepwise regression method involves finding an optimal robust regression equation with a set of correct independent variables that have a significant influence on the dependent variable through a series of tests e g f tests t tests alexopoulos 2010 it has been widely used in hydrological knight et al 2008 pena arancibia et al 2010 and ecological bradbury et al 2000 studies to perform the stepwise regression analysis a one dimensional regression equation is established for each given variable x1 x2 x3 xm and the dependent variable y 3 y a i x i b i e i i 1 2 3 m then calculate the f statistic for the regression coefficients in each of the m regression equations until the maximum value of f is less than f0 05 1 n 2 where n is the number of years in this study note that before stepwise regression we normalized each variable y x1 x2 x3 xm finally we obtained a1 a2 a3 am the relative contribution of each xi can be calculated as 4 x i a i i 1 m a i i 1 2 3 m 3 results 3 1 assessment of et products using etwb fig 2 shows the differences between the calculated etwb and et products etgleam and etera5 in the six pan arctic river basins during 2002 2016 the multiyear mean annual etwb in the six basins ranged from 236 to 370 mm yr 1 with the highest etwb in the ob river basin 370 mm yr 1 and the lowest etwb in the lena and kolyma river basins 236 mm yr 1 and 268 mm yr 1 respectively although the etwb and et products varied almost consistently over time the values differed significantly generally the et products underestimated winter et december february and overestimated summer et may july in most basins the values of the et products were 2 6 times higher than those of etwb from december to february while from may to july the values of the et products were only approximately half of those of etwb in addition et in other months was also over or underestimated to varying degrees but to a lesser degree than in summer or winter the ratio correction method was used to correct the two etmod values i e gleam and era5 the relationship between the monthly corrected etmod product values and the etwb values is displayed in fig 3 after correction the mean absolute error mae and root mean square error rmse of the etmod product decreased and the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse and correlation coefficient r increased to a large extent for example mae decreased from 12 1 mm to 7 3 mm and rmse decreased from 17 7 mm to 10 2 mm for etgleam after correction nse increased from 0 5 to 0 8 and r increased from 0 8 to 0 9 etera5 showed a similar performance as etgleam notably the average values of the corrected etgleam and etera5 performed better than the single corrected etgleam or etera5 since etgleam and etera5 have similar magnitudes and variations the corrected et is expressed as the average values of the corrected etgleam and etera5 these statistical values show that the performances of etmod were significantly improved by the ratio correction method especially for etgleam and etera5 fig 3c f based on the corrected et estimates we found that the six river basins differed greatly in et and pet table 2 the multiyear mean et in the ob river basin was the highest among the six basins 366 mm yr 1 this was followed by the mackenzie yukon and yenisei river basins with values of 295 mm yr 1 278 mm yr 1 and 271 mm yr 1 respectively the permafrost dominated basins kolyma and lena river basins with 100 and 79 of continuous permafrost area respectively exhibited lower et 239 mm yr 1 and 228 mm yr 1 respectively the multiyear mean pet also showed similar characteristics among the different basins that is it was higher in the ob river basin and lower in the kolyma and lena river basins 3 2 regional et and potential influential factor variations the temporal variations in the annual et and pet for these pan arctic river basins are shown in fig 4 during the past 40 years the et showed significant upwards trends in the five basins ranging from 2 27 to 7 51 mm decade 1 fig 4a except in the mackenzie river basin p 0 05 the et in the kolyma river basin significantly increased by 7 51 mm decade 1 p 0 001 which was even faster than that in the ob river basin 5 18 mm decade 1 p 0 05 which had the highest et additionally the et of the lena river basin also increased significantly with a positive trend of 4 28 mm decade 1 p 0 001 notably the kolyma and lena river basins had lower et and developed larger areas of permafrost than the other basins in addition the higher et values 95 quartiles of daily et in each year increased in these pan arctic river basins especially in the kolyma and lena river basins where the difference between the adjacent 20 years 1981 2000 and 2001 2020 reached 0 06 mm day which is much larger than that in the other basins 0 01 0 04 mm day over the past 40 years pet showed a significant increasing trend in the ob yenisei and lena river basins ranging from 6 65 mm decade 1 to 10 02 mm decade 1 fig 4b but showed a stable and unchanged trend in the other three basins p 0 05 the ob river basin with the smallest permafrost area had the fastest increasing trend of pet 10 02 mm decade 1 p 0 001 furthermore pet showed the opposite pattern to et and did not show a significant increasing trend in the kolyma river basin p 0 05 where permafrost is widely developed the same is true for the lena river basin table 2 shows the difference in the potential influential factors among the six pan arctic river basins the multiyear mean air temperature was below 0 c in the river basins except the ob river basin 0 7 c during 1981 2020 and the permafrost dominated basins kolyma and lena river basins were colder with temperatures of 12 1 c and 9 4 c respectively in the yukon yenisei and mackenzie river basins the temperatures were 5 4 c 4 9 c and 3 7 c respectively both snsr and vpd had similar relative magnitudes as t across the six basins p varied greatly in different basins ranging from 290 mm yr 1 in the kolyma river basin to 462 mm yr 1 in the ob river basin p in the yenisei lena yukon and mackenzie river basins were 421 mm yr 1 383 mm yr 1 355 mm yr 1 and 407 mm yr 1 respectively the wind speed in the six basins was stable ranging from 2 to 3 m s 1 the soil water content also remained nearly stable at approximately 0 3 lai was higher in the ob mackenzie and yenisei river basins varying from 1 0 to 1 4 m2 m 2 while it was lower in the lena yukon and kolyma river basins ranging from 0 4 to 0 7 moreover the alts were 43 9 cm 55 3 cm and 33 2 cm in the yenisei lena and kolyma river basins respectively and 20 cm in the other basins in general t and snsr showed significant increasing trends in most basins except snsr in the mackenzie river basin p 0 05 in the kolyma river basin the increasing trend of t was consistent with that of e which was the fastest in these basins the trends of lai in the ob yenisei lena kolyma and yukon river basins were 0 07 m2 m 2 decade 1 0 09 m2 m 2 decade 1 0 07 m2 m 2 decade 1 0 10 m2 m 2 decade 1 and 0 15 m2 m 2 decade 1 respectively only in the ob and kolyma river basins did p show significant increasing trends of 13 57 mm decade 1 and 16 24 mm decade 1 respectively sw in the ob yukon and mackenzie river basins exhibited a significant increasing trend for vpd significant increasing trends were observed in the five basins except the kolyma river basin with trends in the ob yenisei lena yukon and mackenzie river basins of 8 01 pa decade 1 11 38 pa decade 1 7 59 pa decade 1 4 64 pa decade 1 and 8 35 pa decade 1 respectively alt showed a significant increasing trend in the kolyma and lena river basins with values of 0 01 cm decade 1 and 0 01 cm decade 1 respectively fig 5 exhibits the spatial variation in annual et over the pan arctic river basins in basins with larger continuous permafrost areas while the magnitude of the annual et was lower the trend in annual et was faster in the permafrost dominated basins i e the kolyma and lena river basins the annual et values did not exceed 240 mm yr 1 in all grids fig 5a however in the ob and mackenzie river basins where permafrost is less developed the annual et values can reach 500 mm yr 1 in certain grids which is approximately twice as high as that in the permafrost dominated basins i e kolyma and lena river basins in contrast to the et magnitudes the annual et increase rate was more notable in permafrost dominated basins than in other basins fig 5b for example in the kolyma river basin the maximum trend in annual et reached 10 mm decade 1 and 68 1 of the area increased at a rate of more than 2 mm decade 1 this finding is consistent with the above results obtained at the basin scale in addition some grids showed a decreasing trend in et for example in the southwestern part of the ob river basin the southeastern part of the yenisei river basin and the northern part of the lena river basin 3 3 predominant factors influencing et we selected eight variables to identify the predominant factors influencing et temperature t precipitation p solar net surface radiation snsr wind speed ws soil water content sw water vapour pressure deficit vpd leaf area index lai and active layer thickness alt to identify the predominant influential factors the relative contributions of the influential factors to et were calculated by stepwise regression table 3 in general t and snsr had a large contribution to annual et 13 26 in both permafrost dominated and less permafrost developed basins and the result is consistent with that reported by shi et al 2022 and tang and tang 2021 lai also contributed significantly to annual et in the lena kolyma yukon and mackenzie river basins especially the kolyma and mackenzie river basins where the contribution was approximately 20 the contribution of p to et reached 15 27 in the ob yenisei and mackenzie river basins p 0 05 however alt behaved in a different way from other factors in the permafrost dominated basin i e the kolyma river basin which was the largest contributor to annual et specifically in the ob river basin changes in t p and snsr had a large positive effect on the magnitude of annual et contributing more than 60 p and snsr also had large positive effect on et in the yenisei river basin contributing approximately 48 in the yukon river basin factors showed positive effects on et except p ws sw and alt with p values that were not significant only t and snsr contributed approximately 45 to et and the positive effect of vpd and lai on et was approximately 28 moreover vpd and lai had positive effects on et in the mackenzie river basin accounting for more than one third of the total and t p and snsr also played an important positive role 48 interestingly in addition to the positive effects of t snsr and vpd the positive effects of alt and lai were also shown in basins where permafrost is widely developed such as the kolyma and lena river basins most importantly alt was the main contributor to the positive effect on et in the two permafrost dominated basins 4 discussion 4 1 permafrost thaw driven changes in et the pan arctic has experienced dramatic warming krause jensen et al 2020 and intensified warm extremes over the past decades wang et al 2022a yu et al 2021 due to the arctic amplification of climate change overland et al 2014 serreze and barry 2011 the permafrost region across the pan arctic stores a remarkable amount of ancient carbon natali et al 2021 approximately twice the total amount of carbon that is in the earth s atmosphere permafrost degradation and the formation of thermokarst lakes will release vast amounts of methane and co2 knoblauch et al 2021 which will provide positive feedback to the warming climate yumashev et al 2019 therefore permafrost degradation has the potential to amplify climate warming due to carbon and methane release from thawed sediments mu et al 2019 schaefer et al 2014 turetsky et al 2020 walter et al 2006 with the continuous warming in the pan arctic region the precipitation rate has increased intensely bintanja et al 2020 and more than 70 of the annual precipitation evaporates from may to september ohta et al 2008 therefore et in the pan arctic region will likely increase rapidly with climate warming mccrystall et al 2021 interestingly the rapidly increasing et regions coincide with the development of massive thermokarst lakes rapid permafrost degradation is expected under a warming climate nitzbon et al 2020 leading to the rapid formation of thermokarst landslides and lakes farquharson et al 2019 lewkowicz and way 2019 permafrost thawing and thermal karst lake expansion due to warming may be other important influential factors driving the rapidly increasing et in permafrost dominated basins in the future the formation of thermokarst lakes is the result of permafrost thawing mainly in ice rich yedoma deposits which is an ecosystem rapidly expanding with climate change in t zandt et al 2020 tan and zhuang 2015 confirmed that the extent of thermokarst lakes will expand in the northern lowlands across the pan arctic region future climate change is expected to reduce permafrost by more than 90 by the end of the 21st century leading to the formation of massive thermokarst lakes karlsson et al 2015 labrecque et al 2009 thus permafrost thawing under rapid climate warming in recent decades may lead to notable increases in et this is confirmed by the rapid increase in et under a warming climate in the kolyma river basin which is entirely covered by continuous permafrost fig 5b in addition zhang et al 2011 found that the advancing and lengthening of the nonfreezing season were associated with an upwards trend in the regional average annual et from 1983 to 2006 zhang et al 2021 further reported that annual et is positively correlated with the annual number of non frozen days dnf over a river basin with stronger correlations at higher latitudes than in lower latitude areas with climate warming and continuous permafrost degradation permafrost dominated basins may eventually transition to non permafrost basins with a consequent increase in dnf and a positive increase in et 4 2 uncertainties in the data analysis etwb derived from the water balance in this study was used as a reference true et value however there are certain uncertainties in etwb mainly from the components of the water balance equation p r ds d t the p data were obtained from gpcc schneider et al 2020 which is the global analysis of daily and monthly precipitation on the earth s land surface based on in situ rain gauge data schneider et al 2020 p is strongly dependent on terrain which varies across orographic fronts but has lower variability in low relief areas andermann et al 2011 in addition the representativeness of sparse in situ data is another serious threat to the uncertainties in p song et al 2016 furthermore r data were obtained from gauging station measurements nevertheless the uncertainty or error in r may increase due to constraints on the measurement method as well as the measurement time especially during the winter frozen period sauer and meyer 1992 additionally ds d t data were obtained from grace estimates which have been widely used for detecting groundwater depletion huang et al 2015 and identifying flood events huang et al 2021 however the uncertainties or errors in ds d t are even larger than those of the two former components uncertainties in estimates of ds d t fall into two categories i those due to errors in the monthly grace gravity field solutions and ii those due to changes in the true monthly mass averages caused by factors other than continental water storage wahr et al 2006 the measurement error processing procedure error and unmodelled mass variations in the earth s interior can all contribute to the uncertainties in ds d t wahr et al 2006 wiese et al 2016 landerer et al 2020 last glacier melt large scale groundwater abstraction and reservoir management also contribute significantly to the uncertainties in water balance estimates immerzeel and bierkens 2012 ye et al 2003 finally although stepwise regression analysis seeks to minimize prediction errors the limitations of stepwise multiple regression are still recognized whittingham et al 2006 both the order of parameter entry or deletion and the number of parameters can affect the result of stepwise regression derksen and keselman 1992 in addition stepwise regression aims to identify a single best minimum adequate model as the sole product of analysis and basing the inference or conclusions on a single model may be misleading therefore models based on physical mechanisms remains a vital tool for understanding projecting and predicting the dynamics of water and heat fluxes between the land surface and the atmosphere lan et al 2020 ma et al 2017 overgaard et al 2006 5 conclusions this study used the ratio correction method to correct et products based on the water balance and obtained long time series et during 1981 2020 we found that increasing rates of annual et were higher in permafrost dominated basins than in those with less permafrost temperature t solar net surface radiation snsr precipitation p leaf area index lai and active layer thickness alt had large contributions to et in most basins the contribution of t or snsr to et reached approximately 20 or greater and such contributions were independent of the ratio of the permafrost area lai contributed significantly in the lena kolyma yukon and mackenzie river basins while p contributed significantly only in the ob yenisei and mackenzie river basins additionally alt appeared to be a main contributor to the increasing et in permafrost dominated basins i e the kolyma and lena basins nevertheless the hidden physical mechanisms of climate warming induced increasing et are complex and require further research however particular attention should be given to carbon release from permafrost degradation which will further enhance climate warming and result in increasing precipitation in turn this will further increase et declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

2702,land evapotranspiration et is a key factor in the hydrological cycle and is particularly sensitive to climate change in the past few decades the pan arctic region has witnessed a strong warming trend causing substantial changes in ground surface conditions however it remains poorly understood how et varies across such a region here we investigated the spatial temporal changes in et over six large pan arctic river basins using corrected et estimates from gleam and era5 land during 1981 2020 the 40 year mean annual et in the ob yenisei lena kolyma yukon and mackenzie river basins were approximately 366 mm yr 1 271 mm yr 1 228 mm yr 1 239 mm yr 1 278 mm yr 1 and 295 mm yr 1 respectively climatologically permafrost dominated basins tend to have lower et than those with less permafrost temporally the annual et in permafrost dominated basins has increased faster than that in less permafrost developed basins over the past four decades this increase is particularly prominent in the kolyma river basin completely covered by permafrost where the significant trend in et 7 5 mm decade 1 p 0 001 is the highest among the six basins further analyses show that intensified permafrost thawing is likely the key factor contributing to increased et in permafrost dominated basins as seen from the positive relationship between the thickening in the active layer alt and the change in et under an amplified warming background et in permafrost dominated regions is expected to continue to increase the results reported in this study improve our understanding of the variations in et and the associated mechanisms in the changing arctic keywords evapotranspiration trend climate warming permafrost degradation pan arctic data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction land surface evapotranspiration et is the water transferred from the land surface and plants to the atmosphere and is the second largest component of the global water cycle following precipitation fisher et al 2017 jung et al 2010 additionally land surface et is a key nexus process in the global water energy carbon cycle teuling et al 2009 on the global scale land surface et returns approximately 59 68 of land precipitation to the atmosphere ma et al 2021 oki and kanae 2006 zhang et al 2016 recent studies have estimated that the hydrological cycle has intensified at a rate of approximately 4 c durack et al 2012 skliris et al 2016 with increasing total precipitation feng et al 2019 and precipitation extremes papalexiou and montanari 2019 consequently global et may increase as a result of global warming and increasing precipitation allan et al 2020 ma et al 2021 wang et al 2022b et is one of the most uncertain components of the water budget rodell et al 2011 wang and dickinson 2012 yoon et al 2019 at both global miralles et al 2016 mueller and seneviratne 2014 zhang et al 2019 and regional jung et al 2019 long et al 2014 scales due to the inherent weaknesses of models cai et al 2014 li et al 2009 yuan et al 2020 and the sparse and short time recorded site observations ma et al 2020a ma and zhang 2022 mueller et al 2011 to reduce the uncertainties in et estimates the advancement of satellite remote sensing has greatly promoted the development of et models such as machine learning models carter and liang 2019 zhao et al 2019 land surface models ma et al 2020b zeng and cai 2018 data assimilation models cui and jia 2021 rodell et al 2004 and satellite remote sensing based models chen and liu 2020 mu et al 2011 yielding several free regional or global et products among et products the global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam dataset and the european centre for medium range weather forecasts reanalysis v5 land era5 land data are available on longer time scales than most other datasets gleam is a semiempirical model that estimates et and its individual components miralles et al 2011b talsma et al 2018 suggested that gleam is robust in relation to errors in forcing data and provides more accurate transpiration than the penman monteith model monteith 1965 penman 1948 and priestley taylor model priestley and taylor 1972 nevertheless chen et al 2022 found that gleam tended to underestimate soil evaporation era5 land et has also been studied on the basin and global scales crowhurst et al 2021 li et al 2022 and it showed lower uncertainty than the other products over 0 1 accordingly there are still uncertainties associated with gleam and era5 land et therefore the et products need to be corrected for further analysis the water balance method is widely used to calculate et in different regions fu et al 2022 liu et al 2016 lv et al 2017 wan et al 2015 and it is usually regarded as the most reliable way to estimate evapotranspiration at the basin scale ma et al 2019 the arctic plays an important role in affecting global terrestrial water cycles and is experiencing an abrupt and sustained period of climate warming jansen et al 2020 rantanen et al 2022 detected that the arctic warmed approximately four times faster than the global mean since 1979 which is considerably more rapid than the value reported in previous studies precipitation in pan arctic regions is also increasing under a warming climate bintanja et al 2020 wang et al 2021b which is partly caused by enhanced land surface et bintanja and selten 2014 an important physical feature of the pan arctic regions is the extensive distribution of permafrost i e perennially frozen ground which is a sensitive indicator of climate change ding et al 2019 french 2017 recent studies have shown that permafrost is warming globally biskaborn et al 2019 oliva and fritz 2018 romanovsky et al 2007 and warming is occurring faster than estimated vaks et al 2020 under a future warmer climate cold ice rich permafrost is expected to thaw quickly nitzbon et al 2020 leading to the rapid formation of thermokarst landslides and lakes farquharson et al 2019 lewkowicz and way 2019 it has been shown that permafrost regions experienced faster temperature warming wang et al 2022a and larger increases in precipitation wang et al 2021b than non permafrost regions across russian pan arctic regions additionally the rate of increase in runoff in the continuous permafrost dominated lena river basin is much faster than that in the non permafrost dominated ob river basin wang et al 2021a it is inferred that hydrological processes are more intense in permafrost dominated regions than in non permafrost dominated regions which is likely related to widespread permafrost thawing et in pan arctic regions experiences large spatiotemporal variations vihma et al 2016 and et changes are coupled to landscape alterations such as permafrost changes vegetation shifts fires and lake and reservoir changes bring et al 2016 liu et al 2022 wrona et al 2016 observations and estimates of et over terrestrial surfaces suffer from various errors and uncertainties in the arctic bring et al 2016 mainly attributed to short term field measurements covering some specific areas i e tundra areas langer et al 2011 recent studies on arctic et have focused on specific vegetation zones and basins han and menzel 2022 krogh and pomeroy 2019 raz yaseef et al 2017 shi et al 2022 or the evaluation of different products models or algorithms for arctic et bring et al 2019 mu et al 2009 su et al 2006 however it is not clear whether the change rate of et in permafrost dominated regions differs from that in non permafrost dominated regions to address this question six large pan arctic river basins i e ob yenisei lena kolyma yukon and mackenzie with different areal extents of permafrost were selected these basins are characterized by high discharge liu et al 2021 wang et al 2021a first we corrected the et products i e gleam and era5 land based on the water balance method to obtain the long time series et from 1981 to 2020 then we analysed the temporal changes in et for six selected river basins the main objectives of this study were therefore to 1 detect the temporal changes in et across pan arctic basins and 2 identify the potential drivers that increase et in permafrost dominated regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area six major pan arctic rivers namely the ob yenisei lena kolyma yukon and mackenzie rivers with lengths of approximately 3977 4803 4387 2091 2716 and 3679 km respectively across different permafrost zones from continuous permafrost to isolated patches amon et al 2012 holmes et al 2012 were selected for this study fig 1 the areas of the river basins are 3 03 106 2 55 106 2 48 106 0 65 106 0 83 106 and 1 74 106 km2 respectively the ob river basin is located in western siberia and contains a large number of small lakes more than 450 000 with an area of 1 km2 xu et al 2020 the region is strongly affected by human activities mainly in the form of industry and agriculture gordeev et al 2004 yang et al 2004 in addition the ob river basin is relatively warm compared with the other five river basins the annual mean temperature in the ob river basin was approximately 0 7 c during 1981 2020 the yenisei river basin contains lake baikal the most voluminous freshwater lake in the world the main anthropogenic factor influencing the hydrology of this basin is the presence of large dams utilized for hydropower generation fabre et al 2019 the lena river basin is composed of approximately 80 continuous permafrost mcclelland et al 2004 and has the largest annual river discharge among the six river basins the kolyma river basin is completely underlain by continuous permafrost mcclelland et al 2004 the yukon river basin covers northwestern canada and boreal alaska and features a long winter freezing period pan et al 2021 the mackenzie river basin whose namesake is the longest river in the arctic is characterized by large lakes that cover 10 of the drainage basin area amon et al 2012 the yukon and mackenzie river basins are much less affected by humans than the other arctic river basins of eurasia wohl et al 2022 2 2 data 2 2 1 gridded et datasets the et datasets were obtained from gleam version 3 5a martens et al 2017 miralles et al 2011a and the era5 land dataset munoz sabater et al 2021 the gleam et product v3 5a was calculated using the priestley and taylor equation driven by satellite and reanalysis data and estimates of potential evapotranspiration pet were converted into actual evaporation using a multiplicative evaporative stress factor based on observations of microwave vegetation optical depth and estimates of root zone soil moisture martens et al 2017 miralles et al 2011a gleam et at high resolution agrees well with in situ measurements martens et al 2018 the era5 land dataset is a replay of era5 climate reanalysis forced by meteorological fields from era5 and it is a state of the art global reanalysis dataset for land applications munoz sabater et al 2021 2 2 2 climatic hydrological permafrost and vegetation data gridded monthly average 2 m temperature t data and potential evapotranspiration pet data with a resolution of 0 5 were obtained from the climatic research unit cru gridded time series dataset v 4 04 harris et al 2020 gridded monthly land surface precipitation p data were obtained from the global precipitation climatology centre gpcc version 2020 at a resolution of 0 25 schneider et al 2020 daily meteorological data were obtained from the era5 land dataset which includes 2 m air temperature 2 m dewpoint temperature solar net surface radiation 10 m wind speed and soil water content 0 100 cm at a spatial resolution of 0 1 munoz sabater et al 2021 vapour pressure deficit vpd is the deficit of the saturated and actual vapour pressure which was quantified by the mean air temperature and dewpoint temperature respectively murray 1967 daily river discharge data from gauging stations during 2003 2019 were obtained from the arctic great rivers observatory arcticgro discharge dataset shiklomanov et al 2021 the terrestrial water storage anomaly twsa was obtained from the gravity recovery and climate experiment at jet propulsion laboratory grace jpl rl06 v02 watkins et al 2015 the permafrost distribution was obtained from the circum arctic map of permafrost and ground ice conditions version 2 brown et al 2002 the active layer thickness alt data for 1980 2016 were obtained from park et al 2016 the leaf area index lai was obtained from the global land surface satellite glass product liang et al 2021 xiao et al 2014 which was produced using satellite observations from the advanced very high resolution radiometer the datasets used in this study were first resampled to 0 5 resolution using the nearest neighbour method followed by aggregation into monthly and annual scales the key features of the datasets are summarized in table 1 2 3 methods 2 3 1 water balance based evapotranspiration at the basin scale at a basin scale the water balance method of employing precipitation runoff and changes in terrestrial water storage is usually regarded as a reliable way to estimate evapotranspiration ma et al 2019 this study derived the monthly water balance based evapotranspiration etwb using 1 e t p r ds d t where p is basin wide precipitation mm month r is river runoff mm month and ds d t is the change in tws mm month a similar water balance analysis was also performed at the annual scale here p was obtained from gpcc version 2020 at a resolution of 0 25 schneider et al 2020 r was obtained from gauging stations during 2002 2016 and from the arcticgro discharge dataset shiklomanov et al 2021 ds d t was calculated as the difference in successive monthly twsa values from grace note that the annual ds d t was calculated as the difference in twsa between consecutive decembers ma et al 2021 we calculated etwb during the period of 2002 2016 the et values in some months may be negative especially in winter and we replaced the negative values with new values the new values were obtained by linearly interpolating the et values for the months before and after the month in which the negative values occurred for example if the et value in march 2005 was negative the new value for march 2005 was obtained by linearly interpolating the et values in february 2005 and april 2005 2 3 2 et product correction feng et al 2021 proposed a simple and efficient correction method based on the water balance method which significantly improved regional et using etwb as the reference data we used the ratio correction method feng et al 2021 to correct the et estimates from gleam and era5 land specifically we calculated the ratio of etwb to the etmod product i e r in equation 2 for each month 2 r i e t w b i e t m o d i i 1 2 3 12 where i represents the month each basin has a single unique value of ri in each month after obtaining ri we multiplied it separately for each month of the et products during 1981 2020 the et annual value is the sum of the et for each day of the year 2 3 3 stepwise regression regression methods are statistical models that establish relationships to predict or estimate one variable as a function of other selected variables kiernan 2014 however the selected variables depend largely on a priori knowledge and occasionally the selected independent variables may not be truly independent resulting in misleading results grafen and hails 2002 stepwise regression analysis is usually used as an alternative to linear regression to perform global sensitivity analysis it is an automatic computational procedure that attempts to find the best multiple regression model using only statistically significant predictors from a larger set of potential predictive variables gagnon and barber 2018 in other words the stepwise regression method involves finding an optimal robust regression equation with a set of correct independent variables that have a significant influence on the dependent variable through a series of tests e g f tests t tests alexopoulos 2010 it has been widely used in hydrological knight et al 2008 pena arancibia et al 2010 and ecological bradbury et al 2000 studies to perform the stepwise regression analysis a one dimensional regression equation is established for each given variable x1 x2 x3 xm and the dependent variable y 3 y a i x i b i e i i 1 2 3 m then calculate the f statistic for the regression coefficients in each of the m regression equations until the maximum value of f is less than f0 05 1 n 2 where n is the number of years in this study note that before stepwise regression we normalized each variable y x1 x2 x3 xm finally we obtained a1 a2 a3 am the relative contribution of each xi can be calculated as 4 x i a i i 1 m a i i 1 2 3 m 3 results 3 1 assessment of et products using etwb fig 2 shows the differences between the calculated etwb and et products etgleam and etera5 in the six pan arctic river basins during 2002 2016 the multiyear mean annual etwb in the six basins ranged from 236 to 370 mm yr 1 with the highest etwb in the ob river basin 370 mm yr 1 and the lowest etwb in the lena and kolyma river basins 236 mm yr 1 and 268 mm yr 1 respectively although the etwb and et products varied almost consistently over time the values differed significantly generally the et products underestimated winter et december february and overestimated summer et may july in most basins the values of the et products were 2 6 times higher than those of etwb from december to february while from may to july the values of the et products were only approximately half of those of etwb in addition et in other months was also over or underestimated to varying degrees but to a lesser degree than in summer or winter the ratio correction method was used to correct the two etmod values i e gleam and era5 the relationship between the monthly corrected etmod product values and the etwb values is displayed in fig 3 after correction the mean absolute error mae and root mean square error rmse of the etmod product decreased and the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse and correlation coefficient r increased to a large extent for example mae decreased from 12 1 mm to 7 3 mm and rmse decreased from 17 7 mm to 10 2 mm for etgleam after correction nse increased from 0 5 to 0 8 and r increased from 0 8 to 0 9 etera5 showed a similar performance as etgleam notably the average values of the corrected etgleam and etera5 performed better than the single corrected etgleam or etera5 since etgleam and etera5 have similar magnitudes and variations the corrected et is expressed as the average values of the corrected etgleam and etera5 these statistical values show that the performances of etmod were significantly improved by the ratio correction method especially for etgleam and etera5 fig 3c f based on the corrected et estimates we found that the six river basins differed greatly in et and pet table 2 the multiyear mean et in the ob river basin was the highest among the six basins 366 mm yr 1 this was followed by the mackenzie yukon and yenisei river basins with values of 295 mm yr 1 278 mm yr 1 and 271 mm yr 1 respectively the permafrost dominated basins kolyma and lena river basins with 100 and 79 of continuous permafrost area respectively exhibited lower et 239 mm yr 1 and 228 mm yr 1 respectively the multiyear mean pet also showed similar characteristics among the different basins that is it was higher in the ob river basin and lower in the kolyma and lena river basins 3 2 regional et and potential influential factor variations the temporal variations in the annual et and pet for these pan arctic river basins are shown in fig 4 during the past 40 years the et showed significant upwards trends in the five basins ranging from 2 27 to 7 51 mm decade 1 fig 4a except in the mackenzie river basin p 0 05 the et in the kolyma river basin significantly increased by 7 51 mm decade 1 p 0 001 which was even faster than that in the ob river basin 5 18 mm decade 1 p 0 05 which had the highest et additionally the et of the lena river basin also increased significantly with a positive trend of 4 28 mm decade 1 p 0 001 notably the kolyma and lena river basins had lower et and developed larger areas of permafrost than the other basins in addition the higher et values 95 quartiles of daily et in each year increased in these pan arctic river basins especially in the kolyma and lena river basins where the difference between the adjacent 20 years 1981 2000 and 2001 2020 reached 0 06 mm day which is much larger than that in the other basins 0 01 0 04 mm day over the past 40 years pet showed a significant increasing trend in the ob yenisei and lena river basins ranging from 6 65 mm decade 1 to 10 02 mm decade 1 fig 4b but showed a stable and unchanged trend in the other three basins p 0 05 the ob river basin with the smallest permafrost area had the fastest increasing trend of pet 10 02 mm decade 1 p 0 001 furthermore pet showed the opposite pattern to et and did not show a significant increasing trend in the kolyma river basin p 0 05 where permafrost is widely developed the same is true for the lena river basin table 2 shows the difference in the potential influential factors among the six pan arctic river basins the multiyear mean air temperature was below 0 c in the river basins except the ob river basin 0 7 c during 1981 2020 and the permafrost dominated basins kolyma and lena river basins were colder with temperatures of 12 1 c and 9 4 c respectively in the yukon yenisei and mackenzie river basins the temperatures were 5 4 c 4 9 c and 3 7 c respectively both snsr and vpd had similar relative magnitudes as t across the six basins p varied greatly in different basins ranging from 290 mm yr 1 in the kolyma river basin to 462 mm yr 1 in the ob river basin p in the yenisei lena yukon and mackenzie river basins were 421 mm yr 1 383 mm yr 1 355 mm yr 1 and 407 mm yr 1 respectively the wind speed in the six basins was stable ranging from 2 to 3 m s 1 the soil water content also remained nearly stable at approximately 0 3 lai was higher in the ob mackenzie and yenisei river basins varying from 1 0 to 1 4 m2 m 2 while it was lower in the lena yukon and kolyma river basins ranging from 0 4 to 0 7 moreover the alts were 43 9 cm 55 3 cm and 33 2 cm in the yenisei lena and kolyma river basins respectively and 20 cm in the other basins in general t and snsr showed significant increasing trends in most basins except snsr in the mackenzie river basin p 0 05 in the kolyma river basin the increasing trend of t was consistent with that of e which was the fastest in these basins the trends of lai in the ob yenisei lena kolyma and yukon river basins were 0 07 m2 m 2 decade 1 0 09 m2 m 2 decade 1 0 07 m2 m 2 decade 1 0 10 m2 m 2 decade 1 and 0 15 m2 m 2 decade 1 respectively only in the ob and kolyma river basins did p show significant increasing trends of 13 57 mm decade 1 and 16 24 mm decade 1 respectively sw in the ob yukon and mackenzie river basins exhibited a significant increasing trend for vpd significant increasing trends were observed in the five basins except the kolyma river basin with trends in the ob yenisei lena yukon and mackenzie river basins of 8 01 pa decade 1 11 38 pa decade 1 7 59 pa decade 1 4 64 pa decade 1 and 8 35 pa decade 1 respectively alt showed a significant increasing trend in the kolyma and lena river basins with values of 0 01 cm decade 1 and 0 01 cm decade 1 respectively fig 5 exhibits the spatial variation in annual et over the pan arctic river basins in basins with larger continuous permafrost areas while the magnitude of the annual et was lower the trend in annual et was faster in the permafrost dominated basins i e the kolyma and lena river basins the annual et values did not exceed 240 mm yr 1 in all grids fig 5a however in the ob and mackenzie river basins where permafrost is less developed the annual et values can reach 500 mm yr 1 in certain grids which is approximately twice as high as that in the permafrost dominated basins i e kolyma and lena river basins in contrast to the et magnitudes the annual et increase rate was more notable in permafrost dominated basins than in other basins fig 5b for example in the kolyma river basin the maximum trend in annual et reached 10 mm decade 1 and 68 1 of the area increased at a rate of more than 2 mm decade 1 this finding is consistent with the above results obtained at the basin scale in addition some grids showed a decreasing trend in et for example in the southwestern part of the ob river basin the southeastern part of the yenisei river basin and the northern part of the lena river basin 3 3 predominant factors influencing et we selected eight variables to identify the predominant factors influencing et temperature t precipitation p solar net surface radiation snsr wind speed ws soil water content sw water vapour pressure deficit vpd leaf area index lai and active layer thickness alt to identify the predominant influential factors the relative contributions of the influential factors to et were calculated by stepwise regression table 3 in general t and snsr had a large contribution to annual et 13 26 in both permafrost dominated and less permafrost developed basins and the result is consistent with that reported by shi et al 2022 and tang and tang 2021 lai also contributed significantly to annual et in the lena kolyma yukon and mackenzie river basins especially the kolyma and mackenzie river basins where the contribution was approximately 20 the contribution of p to et reached 15 27 in the ob yenisei and mackenzie river basins p 0 05 however alt behaved in a different way from other factors in the permafrost dominated basin i e the kolyma river basin which was the largest contributor to annual et specifically in the ob river basin changes in t p and snsr had a large positive effect on the magnitude of annual et contributing more than 60 p and snsr also had large positive effect on et in the yenisei river basin contributing approximately 48 in the yukon river basin factors showed positive effects on et except p ws sw and alt with p values that were not significant only t and snsr contributed approximately 45 to et and the positive effect of vpd and lai on et was approximately 28 moreover vpd and lai had positive effects on et in the mackenzie river basin accounting for more than one third of the total and t p and snsr also played an important positive role 48 interestingly in addition to the positive effects of t snsr and vpd the positive effects of alt and lai were also shown in basins where permafrost is widely developed such as the kolyma and lena river basins most importantly alt was the main contributor to the positive effect on et in the two permafrost dominated basins 4 discussion 4 1 permafrost thaw driven changes in et the pan arctic has experienced dramatic warming krause jensen et al 2020 and intensified warm extremes over the past decades wang et al 2022a yu et al 2021 due to the arctic amplification of climate change overland et al 2014 serreze and barry 2011 the permafrost region across the pan arctic stores a remarkable amount of ancient carbon natali et al 2021 approximately twice the total amount of carbon that is in the earth s atmosphere permafrost degradation and the formation of thermokarst lakes will release vast amounts of methane and co2 knoblauch et al 2021 which will provide positive feedback to the warming climate yumashev et al 2019 therefore permafrost degradation has the potential to amplify climate warming due to carbon and methane release from thawed sediments mu et al 2019 schaefer et al 2014 turetsky et al 2020 walter et al 2006 with the continuous warming in the pan arctic region the precipitation rate has increased intensely bintanja et al 2020 and more than 70 of the annual precipitation evaporates from may to september ohta et al 2008 therefore et in the pan arctic region will likely increase rapidly with climate warming mccrystall et al 2021 interestingly the rapidly increasing et regions coincide with the development of massive thermokarst lakes rapid permafrost degradation is expected under a warming climate nitzbon et al 2020 leading to the rapid formation of thermokarst landslides and lakes farquharson et al 2019 lewkowicz and way 2019 permafrost thawing and thermal karst lake expansion due to warming may be other important influential factors driving the rapidly increasing et in permafrost dominated basins in the future the formation of thermokarst lakes is the result of permafrost thawing mainly in ice rich yedoma deposits which is an ecosystem rapidly expanding with climate change in t zandt et al 2020 tan and zhuang 2015 confirmed that the extent of thermokarst lakes will expand in the northern lowlands across the pan arctic region future climate change is expected to reduce permafrost by more than 90 by the end of the 21st century leading to the formation of massive thermokarst lakes karlsson et al 2015 labrecque et al 2009 thus permafrost thawing under rapid climate warming in recent decades may lead to notable increases in et this is confirmed by the rapid increase in et under a warming climate in the kolyma river basin which is entirely covered by continuous permafrost fig 5b in addition zhang et al 2011 found that the advancing and lengthening of the nonfreezing season were associated with an upwards trend in the regional average annual et from 1983 to 2006 zhang et al 2021 further reported that annual et is positively correlated with the annual number of non frozen days dnf over a river basin with stronger correlations at higher latitudes than in lower latitude areas with climate warming and continuous permafrost degradation permafrost dominated basins may eventually transition to non permafrost basins with a consequent increase in dnf and a positive increase in et 4 2 uncertainties in the data analysis etwb derived from the water balance in this study was used as a reference true et value however there are certain uncertainties in etwb mainly from the components of the water balance equation p r ds d t the p data were obtained from gpcc schneider et al 2020 which is the global analysis of daily and monthly precipitation on the earth s land surface based on in situ rain gauge data schneider et al 2020 p is strongly dependent on terrain which varies across orographic fronts but has lower variability in low relief areas andermann et al 2011 in addition the representativeness of sparse in situ data is another serious threat to the uncertainties in p song et al 2016 furthermore r data were obtained from gauging station measurements nevertheless the uncertainty or error in r may increase due to constraints on the measurement method as well as the measurement time especially during the winter frozen period sauer and meyer 1992 additionally ds d t data were obtained from grace estimates which have been widely used for detecting groundwater depletion huang et al 2015 and identifying flood events huang et al 2021 however the uncertainties or errors in ds d t are even larger than those of the two former components uncertainties in estimates of ds d t fall into two categories i those due to errors in the monthly grace gravity field solutions and ii those due to changes in the true monthly mass averages caused by factors other than continental water storage wahr et al 2006 the measurement error processing procedure error and unmodelled mass variations in the earth s interior can all contribute to the uncertainties in ds d t wahr et al 2006 wiese et al 2016 landerer et al 2020 last glacier melt large scale groundwater abstraction and reservoir management also contribute significantly to the uncertainties in water balance estimates immerzeel and bierkens 2012 ye et al 2003 finally although stepwise regression analysis seeks to minimize prediction errors the limitations of stepwise multiple regression are still recognized whittingham et al 2006 both the order of parameter entry or deletion and the number of parameters can affect the result of stepwise regression derksen and keselman 1992 in addition stepwise regression aims to identify a single best minimum adequate model as the sole product of analysis and basing the inference or conclusions on a single model may be misleading therefore models based on physical mechanisms remains a vital tool for understanding projecting and predicting the dynamics of water and heat fluxes between the land surface and the atmosphere lan et al 2020 ma et al 2017 overgaard et al 2006 5 conclusions this study used the ratio correction method to correct et products based on the water balance and obtained long time series et during 1981 2020 we found that increasing rates of annual et were higher in permafrost dominated basins than in those with less permafrost temperature t solar net surface radiation snsr precipitation p leaf area index lai and active layer thickness alt had large contributions to et in most basins the contribution of t or snsr to et reached approximately 20 or greater and such contributions were independent of the ratio of the permafrost area lai contributed significantly in the lena kolyma yukon and mackenzie river basins while p contributed significantly only in the ob yenisei and mackenzie river basins additionally alt appeared to be a main contributor to the increasing et in permafrost dominated basins i e the kolyma and lena basins nevertheless the hidden physical mechanisms of climate warming induced increasing et are complex and require further research however particular attention should be given to carbon release from permafrost degradation which will further enhance climate warming and result in increasing precipitation in turn this will further increase et declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

2703,under a warming climate many areas of the world are experiencing drier conditions leading to the rising lake evaporation rate and salinity the salinization of a lake or timescale needed to evolve from historically fresh to presently saline state is important for understanding the paleo hydrology and lacustrine geochemical cycling solute loss from transport diffusion advection or density flow and mineral precipitation in lake water are usually neglected in previous studies here the salinization time of a saline lake in the badain jaran desert china is estimated based on the modified mass balance models of radium barium and chloride of lake water by considering the transport and precipitation loss of saline lake solutes the calculated salinization time is 8 493 7 1 559 years the imbalance between imported solutes via groundwater discharge over the salinization time and their inventories in the present lake water suggests significant solute sinks through transport and precipitation specifically sinks of barium lithium and strontium have removed 10 100 times of the present day inventories dissolved in lake water these findings can guide the investigation of salinization processes in other saline lakes of similar hydrological and hydrogeological settings keywords lake salinization groundwater fed lake evaporation topographically closed lake data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction more than 38 of the world s population inhabit drylands huang et al 2017 frequently in endorheic regions these low lying depressions are usually occupied by saline lakes waiser and robarts 2009 two fifths of the world s lakes are saline lerman et al 1995 and are of significance for habituating waterbirds sustaining ecosystems and creating economic benefits wurtsbaugh et al 2017 many saline lakes were fresh in the early holocene and rapid aridification and reduction of precipitation during the holocene led to cessation of runoff and intensive lake evaporation and thereafter triggered lake salinization by accumulating groundwater or surface flow imported constituents hickman and schweger 1993 oviatt 2015 yang et al 2015 lessons learned from the evolution of saline lakes due to past climatic impacts provide a perspective on potential results from current and future climate change an important question particularly looking ahead to future climate change is the salinization time for saline lakes to evolve from their past fresh to present saline state examining the salinization time of existing lakes may hold the key to understanding aridification and paleo hydrology in holocene wang et al 2016 yang 2000 salinization has been a threat to freshwater bodies worldwide dugan et al 2017 kaushal et al 2018 many fresh lakes are undergoing salinization due to the impacts of anthropogenic activities or climate warming dugan and rock 2021 elmarsafy et al 2021 simon and mero 1992 rimmer et al 2006 conservative tracers e g chloride sodium or salinity are often used to explore salinization mechanisms in fresh lakes simon and mero 1992 rimmer et al 2006 some researchers also made attempts to apply the mass balances of these conservative tracers to study the salinization processes in saline lakes for example yang and williams 2003 estimated the increasing rate of sodium content in the north sumujaran lake in the badain jaran desert bjd china zlotnik et al 2012 calculated the salinization timescale of alkalin lake nebraska us based on the total salt mass balance model to date studies on the evolution of saline lakes all regarded the saline lake as a closed system in which the lake water is the terminus of imported solutes chung and craig 2004 gong et al 2016 yang and williams 2003 zlotnik et al 2010 however the transport of saline lake water and precipitation of salt can lead to the loss of lake water solutes when the solute in the lake water is concentrated due to intensive evaporation the solute can be transported to the ambient aquifer via three mechanisms molecular diffusion advection and density dependent flow across and beneath the lake aquifer interface wood and sanford 1990 zhang et al 2020 as the salinity of lake water increases continuously mineral precipitation also occurs when applying the mass balance models in saline lakes transport and precipitation should be considered neglecting these causative components will certainly cause significant bias when studying the salinization processes of saline lakes there are also some proxies to reconstruct the paleo salinity of saline lakes he et al 2020 liu et al 2008 e g alkenones but problems of the timescale of salinization and the associated hydraulic processes cannot be solved based on these proxies thus an attempt is made here to ascertain how the processes of the transport and precipitation of salt affect salinization time by utilizing the mass balance models of radioactive radium ra barium ba and chloride cl in these models ra is often used as a timer chung and craig 2004 loss term of mineral precipitation is considered in the mass balance models of ra and ba the mass balance model of cl incorporates the transport term of lake water solutes the bjd in the western part of inner mongolia is the second largest desert in china and has over one hundred groundwater fed saline lakes with salinity ranging from 1 2 to 483 g l jiao et al 2015 zhang et al 2021a in a representative saline lake in the bjd we established two multiple depth groundwater sampling systems perpendicular to the lakeshore seasonal measurements of major ions trace elements 226ra stable hydrogen 2h and oxygen 18o isotopes were performed in the groundwater sampling transects and lake water to allow identification of downward transport of saline lake water to the lakeshore aquifer to calculate the salinization time of the saline lake we relied on the mass balance models of ra ba and cl by considering the sink terms of downward transport and mineral precipitation based on the imbalance between imported solutes via groundwater discharge over salinization time and their inventories in the present lake water the total amounts of several trace elements ba lithium li and strontium sr lost from transport and precipitation are further estimated 2 radium and barium ra isotopes are one of the most important geochemical tracers for the study of geochemical evolution and water circulation in saline environments kiro et al 2013 liu et al 2019 luo et al 2018 moore and shaw 2008 in fresh water ra is primarily bound to the sediment grain surface while in a saline environment ra mainly exists in the dissolved phase due to intensive desorption kiro et al 2012 webster et al 1995 the shifts of mobility of ra isotopes during the interaction between fresh groundwater and saline surface water makes it a powerful tracer to track the physical mixing and geochemical reactions in the fresh saline transition zone kiro et al 2013 liu et al 2019 226ra is the radioactive progeny of the uranium isotope and disintegrates into the radon isotope 222rn a noble gas this long lived natural occurring 226ra has a half life of 1 600 years which well fits the timescale of most saline lake evolution for example the overturn age of the two layer structure of the dead sea was estimated using the steady state balance model of 226ra stiller and chung 1984 ba and ra are members of the alkaline earth metal group and share similar geochemical behaviors in water moore and dymond 1991 rhein et al 1987 as a result ba can serve as the stable similarity of 226ra and hence 226ra ba can be applied as a proxy to constrain the water age le roy et al 2018 for example steady state scavenging models of ba and ra were used to estimate the overturn age of the meromictic phase of the dead sea by considering the major losses and gains chan and chung 1987 to estimate the isolation time since the earlier overturn of the dead sea a transient box model of the ra and ba was applied in this closed system chung and craig 2004 the isolation time was found to be a linear function of the ratio of ra ba 3 study area the bjd 39 20 42 n 99 48 104 14 e with an area of 5 2 104 km2 is the second largest desert in china fig 1 a the desert is surrounded by heli mountain mt beida mt and yabulai mt to the south and gulunai wetlands and guaizihu wetlands to the north thousands of loose mega sand dunes are formed in the desert with most in a range of 200 300 m and the highest one up to 460 m there are about 140 lakes distributed in the interdune depressions in the southeastern part of the desert about half of the lakes are perennial and the others are occasionally dry in summer and autumn the climate in the bjd is the continental type the annual rainfall is about 117 6 80 3 and 42 1 mm in the southern mountainous areas inner desert and northern guaizihu wetlands respectively ning et al 2021 precipitation mostly takes places from april to october in the hinterlands of the desert the estimated mean evaporation rate of the lake surface is 1040 mm year about 13 times as much as the precipitation yang et al 2010 the air temperature varies from 15 to 30 c with an average of 11 6 c the duration of the frozen season is about four months from november to the next march ning et al 2015 the bjd basin belongs to the alxa tectonic block the sedimentary basin mainly consists of three formations fig 2 the deepest cretaceous sandstones have a thickness ranging from 1 000 to 4 000 m wang et al 2014 the middle layer is a low permeable neogene clay and fine sandstone ma et al 2007 the surface layer is the quaternary sand with a depth of 100 300 m the sandy sediments are the main aquifer with a hydraulic conductivity of 3 20 m d zhang et al 2015 the regional groundwater flows from the southern and southeastern mountainous regions to the northern wetlands areas zhang et al 2015 the local groundwater flow directions are from the water mounds inside these giant sand dunes to the lake water fig 2b in other words every lake can receive groundwater recharge from surrounding sand dunes and local groundwater flow around the lake is towards the lake the field observation station was established in the south sumujaran lake 39 7906 n 102 4229 e the second largest lake in the bjd the lake has an area of about 1 26 km2 and an average depth of 8 m fig 1b and 1c similar to other lakes in the desert south sumujaran lake is topographically closed from runoff and mainly recharged by groundwater and episodic rainfalls on the lake surface fresh saline transition zones are observed in the south and west lakeshore but not in the east lakeshore zhang et al 2021b the saline plume tailing from the lake can reach up to 70 m over 6 times of the average lake depth and dragged toward the down regional hydraulic gradient the saline plume below each lake is not only subject to the density difference between overlying saline lake water and underlying fresh groundwater but also the regional groundwater flow zhang et al 2020 the lake water and lakeside groundwater levels fluctuate seasonally with amplitudes less than 0 5 m gong et al 2016 and are high in april and low in october the high lake level period is not at summer and autumn with some scarce rain but at dry winter and spring the intense evaporation at hot summer and autumn evaporates water and the lake water level is declined at winter and spring the lake level is recovered by receiving groundwater recharge 4 materials and methods 4 1 field sampling multilevel groundwater sampling systems were installed at the east and west lakeshore of the south sumujaran lake in june 2018 fig 1c zhang et al 2021a b in each sampling site a well group was composed of several nylon tubes with their water inlets buried at different depths the water inlets were less than 2 cm groundwater samples were collected from the sampling systems four times in october 2018 january 2019 april 2019 and july 2019 in january because the groundwater close to the lakeshore was frozen due to shallow water table and low air temperature saline groundwater samples were unable to be collected in the sampling systems instead eight lakebed pore water was collected in two sites about 5 m and 10 m away from the lakeshore using a push point sampler lake water was also sampled seasonally near the east and west lakeshore in april 2019 samples from three water columns were collected a total of 22 lake water 71 fresh groundwater and 24 saline groundwater were sampled 4 2 field and laboratory analysis oxidation and reduction potential orp temperature and ph were measured in situ using a calibrated portable multi parameter

isotope water analyzer iwa 45ep lgr co with an analytical error less than 0 5 for δ2h and 0 1 for δ18o 5 conceptual models our conceptual model is developed by considering a topographically closed hyper dry basin fig 3 shows the mass balance of lake water solutes for such a basin no solutes enter or leave by surface runoff solutes mainly enter the lake via groundwater flow evaporation pumps water out from the basin but solutes remain behind thus solutes are accumulated over time solutes may be lost from various processes including diffusion advection density dependent flow and mineral precipitation our conceptual model assumes that the lake water is well mixed this assumption allows the mass balance equations of solutes to represent the average status and still provides important information about the total amounts of solutes lost via downward transport and mineral precipitation given that the groundwater imported solutes lie in lake storage and lost from transport precipitation or decay the imported storage loss the coupled mass balance models of ba 226ra and cl are chan and chung 1987 stiller and chung 1984 1 f b a gw p b a lake 1 α v b a lake 2 f 226 ra gw p

different seasons more details are in the supplementary information about 226ra activities h and o isotopic compositions concentrations of major ions and ba ph orp tds and si 6 1 seasonal changes of 226ra h and o in fresh groundwater and saline lake water total dissolved solids tds of lake water are over 135 g l in july summer and slightly low 128 g l in april spring table 1 similarly the activity of 226ra in lake water has low activity in spring 100 to 450 dpm 100l and high activity in summer 550 dpm 100l δ2h and δ18o of lake water have the most depleted compositions in winter 30 06 for δ2h and 0 73 for δ18o during other seasons values of δ2h and δ18o range from 6 3 and 6 7 respectively the groundwater hydrogeochemistry also exhibits seasonality figs 4 and 5 the two sampling transects are both close to the lakeshore and hence the water table is shallow and subject to phreatic evaporation the average tds of fresh groundwater is about 0 5 g l in october and 0 38 g l in april the average values of fresh groundwater are 52 3 in october and 56 1 in april for δ2h and 4 2 in october and 5 2 in april for δ18o the average radioactivity of 226ra of fresh groundwater is 47 4 dpm 100l in october and 36 3 dpm 100l in april 6 2 saline groundwater field measurements show that the saline groundwater only exists near the west lakeshore in the east groundwater sampling transect all the samples are fresh even if the near shore three samples were collected below the lakebed these findings are consistent with former electrical resistivity tomography ert results which found that the saline lake water intruded into the south and west lakeshore aquifers and groundwater in the east lakeshore was dominant by fresh groundwater zhang et al 2021b the tds of sampled saline groundwater ranges from 2 2 to 80 2 g l in october and from 1 5 to 30 9 g l in april the isotopic compositions for δ2h and δ18o respectively ranges from 60 8 to 16 8 and from 6 1 to 3 1 in october and from 61 6 to 49 0 and from 6 2 to 3 3 in april the radioactivity of 226ra has a range of 11 1 392 9 dpm 100l in october and 75 5 127 1 dpm 100l in april the movements of the fresh saline transition zone in the west lakeshore also present a seasonality fig 5 the tds contour line of 1 g l moves towards lakeshore in april and away from lakeshore in october this process makes the groundwater samples collected from the same locations vary seasonally comparing fig 5a with 5b and 5c with 5d the values of δ18o and 226ra of the saline groundwater in october are much higher than those in april 6 3 evaporation dominated hydrogeochemistry the seasonal hydrogeochemical and isotopic dynamics of groundwater and lake water are mainly controlled by evaporation the groundwater recharge to the lake is generally high in winter and spring and low in summer and autumn wang et al 2020 the extremely high evaporation rate in summer and autumn effectively concentrates the solute in lake water while the lake water is diluted by fresh groundwater in winter and spring the lower values of tds δ18o and 226ra activity in saline groundwater are influenced by rainfall recharge and interaction with fresh groundwater the higher values of tds δ18o and 226ra activity are affected by the process of saline lake water infiltration and evaporation as shown in fig 6 a and 6d the fresh groundwater evaporation line and the mixing line between fresh groundwater and saline lake water are very similar it suggests that the lake water is the final product of fresh groundwater undergoing long term intense evaporation the fresh groundwater evaporation line and groundwater lake water mixing line are separated in the plots of tds versus δ18o in fig 6b and 6e respectively it indicates phreatic evaporation can cause intensive fractionation of δ2h and δ18o in fresh groundwater the evaporation process can also elevate the activity of 226ra the activity of fresh groundwater 226ra in october is significantly increased by evaporation compared with that in april fig 6c and 6f the seasonally forward and backward movement of fresh saline transition zone in the west transect mainly affected by evaporation from three aspects first in summer and autumn as the tds of lake water is increased and the density contrast is enlarged the intrusion of lake water into the lakebed is also intensified in winter and spring as the tds of lake water is diluted by fresh groundwater the downward transport of saline lake water is weakened second the high phreatic evaporation in summer and autumn decreases the groundwater discharge to the lake and hence the saline lake water intrusion is strengthened third the seasonally frozen soil can affect the location of the fresh saline transition zone though the maximum frozen depth is only 30 cm ning et al 2015 when the surface soil is frozen the phreatic evaporation is almost prevented and seepage faces of fresh water near the surface are blocked thus the hydraulic gradient pushes the fresh saline transition zone toward the lake to generate new seepage faces in the unfrozen nearshore lakebed as shown in fig 5b the interpolated tds contour of 1 g l is pushed lakeward in april 6 4 groundwater lake water mixing processes given the fact that evaporation line and mixing line in fig 6a and 6d are almost identical while the two lines are separated in fig 6b and 6e the mixing process of saline lake water and fresh groundwater is slightly affected by phreatic evaporation the δ18o is relatively conservative during the mixing process hence we use the mass balance of δ18o to quantify the proportion of the saline lake water flake and fresh groundwater fgw in saline groundwater zhang et al 2021b 7 δ 18 o gw f gw δ 18 o lake f lake δ 18 o s 8 f gw f lake 1 where δ18o gw δ18o s and δ18o lake are oxygen isotopic compositions of fresh groundwater saline groundwater and lake water respectively then the precipitation or production amount of ra d 226 r a dpm

100l are activities of 226ra in fresh groundwater saline groundwater and lake water respectively b a gw b a s and b a lake μg l are contents of ba in fresh groundwater saline groundwater and lake water respectively here the maximum values of 226ra and ba of the lake water are considered to be minorly influenced by co precipitation and fresh groundwater dilutions and therefore employed as the theoretical endmember values of ra 226 ra lake and ba b a lake the positive and negative values of d 226 ra d b a represent the precipitation and production of 226ra ba respectively the results show that the precipitation or production rate of 226ra or ba in saline groundwater is generally positively correlated with the proportion of lake water flake in saline groundwater fig 7 a and b when flake is low 226ra and ba in saline groundwater are supported by desorption from the surface of solid grains when flake is large 226ra and ba are prone to precipitating the precipitation production ratio of 226ra to ba are also positively correlated r2 0 45 p 0 0003 fig 7c 6 5 salinization time as shown in fig 8 the 226ra and ba in fresh groundwater saline groundwater and lake water are closely related this gives us a clue how to quantify the co precipitation or co production 226ra and ba in lake water during salinization process based on the behavior of 226ra and ba during groundwater lake water mixing processes the saline groundwater of different tds can be used to represent saline lakes under different salinization stages and the linear relation between 226ra and ba in the saline groundwater can be ideally used to quantify the salinization time of the saline lake 11 p ba lake p 226 ra lake s s 100 μg dpm is introduced to solve the simultaneous eqs 1 6 by solving eqs 1 11 the analytical solution of salinization time τ is yielded to be 12 τ 1 λ ln 226 ra gw cl lake s ba gw cl lake cl gw ba lake 226 ra lake cl gw s this analytical solution can be employed to quantify the salinization time with the given concentrations of 226ra ba and cl concentrations in the saline lake water and the surrounding fresh groundwater and the linear correlation of the precipitation between 226ra and ba in saline lake water as shown in fig 7c s is estimated to be 0 64 100 μg dpm and other representative concentrations are also listed in table 2 the salinization time of the south sumujaran lake is calculated to be 7 843 years because the analytical error of 226ra measurements is less than 5 and hence the estimated salinization time should be 7 843 392 this value is much higher than that of 2 180 5 814 years using the cl mass balance model of lake water gong et al 2016 the large gap between the two calculated ages may be attributed to the downward transport of saline lake water it is obvious that our result could be more realistic and mechanistic by including solute loss via transports and precipitation by solving simultaneous eqs 1 6 the downward transport coefficient α is further calculated to be 0 106 0 005 which means that about 10 6 of the groundwater imported salts are transported into the lakebed aquifer over the salinization period the calculated salinization time is further cross validated by other dating approaches the organic carbon in the paleo lake sediments of south sumujaran was radiocarbon dated to be 7 843 392 years yang et al 2003 the lacustrine sediments are several meters higher than the present lake level it is likely this lake became saline shortly after its high lake level period moreover about 6 300 8 600 years ago fresh water snails planorbis radix auricularia and adarces occurred in these saline lakes of bjd wang et al 2016 it indicates that at that time most of the lakes were fresh and the salinization did not start the salinization time of 7 843 392 years is therefore reasonable and reliable as the salinization was usually initialized shortly after the freshwater period 7 discussion 7 1 implication for paleo hydrology the lake levels in the bjd reached the maximum about 6 300 8 600 years ago wang et al 2016 at that time the climate was much wetter than the present thus the lake level was about 6 36 m higher than the present and this period is called the pan lake period the prehistoric wet climate sustained the fresh lake and ecosystems when the climate became dry evaporation exceeded the precipitation the lake water volume was reduced solutes in the lake water were concentrated and therefore salinization was initialized it is speculated that the salinization of the lakes in the bjd started at the end of the pan lake period as the dry climate was intensified freshwater resources shrank and the salinization continued topographically closed saline lakes are common in dry climate environments in asia north america south america africa and australia yechieli and wood 2002 in these lakes groundwater is usually the main recharge previous researchers have studied the timescale for a lake changing from freshwater to saline water environments using sodium or salt mass as conservative tracers yang and williams 2003 zlotnik et al 2012 their studies assumed that 1 the lake is in equilibrium with climate under long timescale the impacts of climate variations on lake solute mass balance are not considered 2 influx solutes via groundwater and solutes in lake are under steady state conditions however the solutes in saline lake water are inevitably lost via chemical precipitation and dynamic advection diffusion and or density dependent flow hence this study tries to incorporate the solute loss via precipitation and transport when assessing the salinization time using the lake solute mass balance models our modification improves the precision of the quantification of salinization time 7 2 implications for mineral resources evaluation along with accumulations of ion contents in these saline lakes minerals e g calcite gypsum and barite are prone to precipitating when they are oversaturated fig 7c the results show that the si of aragonite barite calcite dolomite and gypsum in lake water are 2 5 4 1 2 66 6 0 and 1 6 respectively it indicates that these minerals are all oversaturated and will continuously deposit to the lake bottom on the other hand solutes in the lake water are transported into the lakebed aquifer due to advection diffusion or density differences the two processes induce significant solute sinks with the obtained salinization time solute sinks via precipitation and downward transports can be further estimated given that the pristine fresh lake has the same solute concentrations as the present fresh groundwater the masses m μg of solutes precipitated and transported into the aquifer can be calculated based on the mass balance equation 13 c gw v τ d c gw c lake v m where clake and cgw are the solute concentrations in the saline lake water and fresh groundwater respectively the average concentrations of ba li and sr in fresh groundwater are 35 9 and 398 μg l respectively and in lake water are 294 381 and 1611 μg l respectively the total precipitated and downward transported ba li and sr are finally estimated to be 428 21 105 5 and 4819 240 tons over the salinization process respectively these precipitated and transported chemicals are about 192 10 36 2 and 394 20 times as much as the lake inventories of ba li and sr respectively the concentrated solutes in the saline lakes provide us valuable mineral resources zheng 2001 saline lakes are normally regarded as the terminals of surface subsurface runoff but cannot be considered as terminals for salts due to the possible loss via downward transport and precipitation the precipitated and transported solutes are the function of salinization time and can be developed to be significant mineral sources in the arid lake basins 7 3 limitations and sensitivity analysis filed observation and si in lake water show that solutes in lake water are lost from downward transport and mineral precipitation the two parts are very important for estimation of salinization time of saline lake using solute mass balance model salinization process is dominated by climate variations the lake water level solute concentrations in lake water and fresh saline transition zone change seasonally or even in a longer timescale the calculation of salinization time in this study is unable to incorporate these variations but try to capture the average state of the lake on the present evolution stage sensitivity analysis of the calculation of salinization time is shown in fig 9 based on the measured values of different endmembers the calculated salinization time is sensitive to 226ra activities and cl concentrations in fresh groundwater and lake water but not sensitive to ba concentrations in fresh groundwater and lake water and the precipitation slope s in saline groundwater lakes in the bjd are mainly recharge by regional groundwater zhang et al 2021b which is slightly influenced by evaporation and has low solute concentrations in the two groundwater sampling transects most groundwater samples are affected by phreatic evaporation to eliminate the effect of evaporation it is necessary to choose the groundwater sample with the lowest 226ra activities and cl concentrations as the fresh groundwater endmember 226ra activities and cl concentrations in lake water generally change proportionally after we consider the seasonal change and spatial heterogeneity of 226ra activities and cl concentrations in lake water the salinization time is then calculated to be 8493 7 1559 years hence the precipitated and transported ba li and sr are about 208 38 39 7 and 427 78 times as much as the lake inventories of ba li and sr respectively the downward intrusion coefficient of lake water ranges from 0 21 to 4 8 this coefficient is sensitive to the salt inventory in the lake thus to improve the calculation precision more precise lakebed bathymetry and high resolution water sampling are needed salt dust emissions from the lakeshore of saline lakes are natural processes and influence the solute budget in the lake basin zlotnik et al 2012 in our conceptual model we focus on the solute mass balance in lake water once the solute leaves the lake water we assign this part to be precipitated or transported the lake water level will drop under dry climate conditions and the lake water inundated area is reduced that gives an opportunity for the salt in previous lakebed to exposed to wind blow salt dust emission is driven by wind and likely obstructed by lake bank slope hence the salt dust density in the lake bank soil is overall decreased with radial distance from the lakeshore zlotnik et al 2012 this part of salt may be flushed to shallow groundwater by rainfall infiltration wood and sanford 1995 shallow groundwater carries this part of salt back to the lake again our conceptual model does not treat this part of salt as being lost from the lake water in addition there are many kinds of salt cycles between the lake and ambient environments e g dissolution of precipitation minerals solute diffusion from the lakebed and recirculated solutes via density dependent flow to simplify these salt cycles we only consider the net solute sinks via these processes 8 summary this study developed an analytical solution for the salinization time of saline lakes and solute lost from precipitation and downward transports in arid environments hydrogeochemstry patterns in the groundwater sampling transects show the downward transport of lake solutes the δ2h and δ18o mixing line of fresh groundwater and saline lake water is consistent with the δ2h and δ18o evaporation line of fresh groundwater it gives us a clue that the saline groundwater with different salinity can be used to represent lake water at varying salinization stages hence we utilize the conservation of δ18o in mixing processes in the fresh saline transition zone to quantify the precipitation and production rate of 226ra and ba the precipitation rate ratio of 226ra and ba in saline groundwater are utilized to solve the 226ra ba and cl mass balance models in the lake water the salinization time is estimated to be 8493 7 1559 years the calculated salinization time is cross validated by other dating approaches the precipitated and downward transported solutes over the salinization time are further estimated to be 10 100 times of their inventories in the lake water the salinization time can characterize the initialization of fresh water

2703,under a warming climate many areas of the world are experiencing drier conditions leading to the rising lake evaporation rate and salinity the salinization of a lake or timescale needed to evolve from historically fresh to presently saline state is important for understanding the paleo hydrology and lacustrine geochemical cycling solute loss from transport diffusion advection or density flow and mineral precipitation in lake water are usually neglected in previous studies here the salinization time of a saline lake in the badain jaran desert china is estimated based on the modified mass balance models of radium barium and chloride of lake water by considering the transport and precipitation loss of saline lake solutes the calculated salinization time is 8 493 7 1 559 years the imbalance between imported solutes via groundwater discharge over the salinization time and their inventories in the present lake water suggests significant solute sinks through transport and precipitation specifically sinks of barium lithium and strontium have removed 10 100 times of the present day inventories dissolved in lake water these findings can guide the investigation of salinization processes in other saline lakes of similar hydrological and hydrogeological settings keywords lake salinization groundwater fed lake evaporation topographically closed lake data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction more than 38 of the world s population inhabit drylands huang et al 2017 frequently in endorheic regions these low lying depressions are usually occupied by saline lakes waiser and robarts 2009 two fifths of the world s lakes are saline lerman et al 1995 and are of significance for habituating waterbirds sustaining ecosystems and creating economic benefits wurtsbaugh et al 2017 many saline lakes were fresh in the early holocene and rapid aridification and reduction of precipitation during the holocene led to cessation of runoff and intensive lake evaporation and thereafter triggered lake salinization by accumulating groundwater or surface flow imported constituents hickman and schweger 1993 oviatt 2015 yang et al 2015 lessons learned from the evolution of saline lakes due to past climatic impacts provide a perspective on potential results from current and future climate change an important question particularly looking ahead to future climate change is the salinization time for saline lakes to evolve from their past fresh to present saline state examining the salinization time of existing lakes may hold the key to understanding aridification and paleo hydrology in holocene wang et al 2016 yang 2000 salinization has been a threat to freshwater bodies worldwide dugan et al 2017 kaushal et al 2018 many fresh lakes are undergoing salinization due to the impacts of anthropogenic activities or climate warming dugan and rock 2021 elmarsafy et al 2021 simon and mero 1992 rimmer et al 2006 conservative tracers e g chloride sodium or salinity are often used to explore salinization mechanisms in fresh lakes simon and mero 1992 rimmer et al 2006 some researchers also made attempts to apply the mass balances of these conservative tracers to study the salinization processes in saline lakes for example yang and williams 2003 estimated the increasing rate of sodium content in the north sumujaran lake in the badain jaran desert bjd china zlotnik et al 2012 calculated the salinization timescale of alkalin lake nebraska us based on the total salt mass balance model to date studies on the evolution of saline lakes all regarded the saline lake as a closed system in which the lake water is the terminus of imported solutes chung and craig 2004 gong et al 2016 yang and williams 2003 zlotnik et al 2010 however the transport of saline lake water and precipitation of salt can lead to the loss of lake water solutes when the solute in the lake water is concentrated due to intensive evaporation the solute can be transported to the ambient aquifer via three mechanisms molecular diffusion advection and density dependent flow across and beneath the lake aquifer interface wood and sanford 1990 zhang et al 2020 as the salinity of lake water increases continuously mineral precipitation also occurs when applying the mass balance models in saline lakes transport and precipitation should be considered neglecting these causative components will certainly cause significant bias when studying the salinization processes of saline lakes there are also some proxies to reconstruct the paleo salinity of saline lakes he et al 2020 liu et al 2008 e g alkenones but problems of the timescale of salinization and the associated hydraulic processes cannot be solved based on these proxies thus an attempt is made here to ascertain how the processes of the transport and precipitation of salt affect salinization time by utilizing the mass balance models of radioactive radium ra barium ba and chloride cl in these models ra is often used as a timer chung and craig 2004 loss term of mineral precipitation is considered in the mass balance models of ra and ba the mass balance model of cl incorporates the transport term of lake water solutes the bjd in the western part of inner mongolia is the second largest desert in china and has over one hundred groundwater fed saline lakes with salinity ranging from 1 2 to 483 g l jiao et al 2015 zhang et al 2021a in a representative saline lake in the bjd we established two multiple depth groundwater sampling systems perpendicular to the lakeshore seasonal measurements of major ions trace elements 226ra stable hydrogen 2h and oxygen 18o isotopes were performed in the groundwater sampling transects and lake water to allow identification of downward transport of saline lake water to the lakeshore aquifer to calculate the salinization time of the saline lake we relied on the mass balance models of ra ba and cl by considering the sink terms of downward transport and mineral precipitation based on the imbalance between imported solutes via groundwater discharge over salinization time and their inventories in the present lake water the total amounts of several trace elements ba lithium li and strontium sr lost from transport and precipitation are further estimated 2 radium and barium ra isotopes are one of the most important geochemical tracers for the study of geochemical evolution and water circulation in saline environments kiro et al 2013 liu et al 2019 luo et al 2018 moore and shaw 2008 in fresh water ra is primarily bound to the sediment grain surface while in a saline environment ra mainly exists in the dissolved phase due to intensive desorption kiro et al 2012 webster et al 1995 the shifts of mobility of ra isotopes during the interaction between fresh groundwater and saline surface water makes it a powerful tracer to track the physical mixing and geochemical reactions in the fresh saline transition zone kiro et al 2013 liu et al 2019 226ra is the radioactive progeny of the uranium isotope and disintegrates into the radon isotope 222rn a noble gas this long lived natural occurring 226ra has a half life of 1 600 years which well fits the timescale of most saline lake evolution for example the overturn age of the two layer structure of the dead sea was estimated using the steady state balance model of 226ra stiller and chung 1984 ba and ra are members of the alkaline earth metal group and share similar geochemical behaviors in water moore and dymond 1991 rhein et al 1987 as a result ba can serve as the stable similarity of 226ra and hence 226ra ba can be applied as a proxy to constrain the water age le roy et al 2018 for example steady state scavenging models of ba and ra were used to estimate the overturn age of the meromictic phase of the dead sea by considering the major losses and gains chan and chung 1987 to estimate the isolation time since the earlier overturn of the dead sea a transient box model of the ra and ba was applied in this closed system chung and craig 2004 the isolation time was found to be a linear function of the ratio of ra ba 3 study area the bjd 39 20 42 n 99 48 104 14 e with an area of 5 2 104 km2 is the second largest desert in china fig 1 a the desert is surrounded by heli mountain mt beida mt and yabulai mt to the south and gulunai wetlands and guaizihu wetlands to the north thousands of loose mega sand dunes are formed in the desert with most in a range of 200 300 m and the highest one up to 460 m there are about 140 lakes distributed in the interdune depressions in the southeastern part of the desert about half of the lakes are perennial and the others are occasionally dry in summer and autumn the climate in the bjd is the continental type the annual rainfall is about 117 6 80 3 and 42 1 mm in the southern mountainous areas inner desert and northern guaizihu wetlands respectively ning et al 2021 precipitation mostly takes places from april to october in the hinterlands of the desert the estimated mean evaporation rate of the lake surface is 1040 mm year about 13 times as much as the precipitation yang et al 2010 the air temperature varies from 15 to 30 c with an average of 11 6 c the duration of the frozen season is about four months from november to the next march ning et al 2015 the bjd basin belongs to the alxa tectonic block the sedimentary basin mainly consists of three formations fig 2 the deepest cretaceous sandstones have a thickness ranging from 1 000 to 4 000 m wang et al 2014 the middle layer is a low permeable neogene clay and fine sandstone ma et al 2007 the surface layer is the quaternary sand with a depth of 100 300 m the sandy sediments are the main aquifer with a hydraulic conductivity of 3 20 m d zhang et al 2015 the regional groundwater flows from the southern and southeastern mountainous regions to the northern wetlands areas zhang et al 2015 the local groundwater flow directions are from the water mounds inside these giant sand dunes to the lake water fig 2b in other words every lake can receive groundwater recharge from surrounding sand dunes and local groundwater flow around the lake is towards the lake the field observation station was established in the south sumujaran lake 39 7906 n 102 4229 e the second largest lake in the bjd the lake has an area of about 1 26 km2 and an average depth of 8 m fig 1b and 1c similar to other lakes in the desert south sumujaran lake is topographically closed from runoff and mainly recharged by groundwater and episodic rainfalls on the lake surface fresh saline transition zones are observed in the south and west lakeshore but not in the east lakeshore zhang et al 2021b the saline plume tailing from the lake can reach up to 70 m over 6 times of the average lake depth and dragged toward the down regional hydraulic gradient the saline plume below each lake is not only subject to the density difference between overlying saline lake water and underlying fresh groundwater but also the regional groundwater flow zhang et al 2020 the lake water and lakeside groundwater levels fluctuate seasonally with amplitudes less than 0 5 m gong et al 2016 and are high in april and low in october the high lake level period is not at summer and autumn with some scarce rain but at dry winter and spring the intense evaporation at hot summer and autumn evaporates water and the lake water level is declined at winter and spring the lake level is recovered by receiving groundwater recharge 4 materials and methods 4 1 field sampling multilevel groundwater sampling systems were installed at the east and west lakeshore of the south sumujaran lake in june 2018 fig 1c zhang et al 2021a b in each sampling site a well group was composed of several nylon tubes with their water inlets buried at different depths the water inlets were less than 2 cm groundwater samples were collected from the sampling systems four times in october 2018 january 2019 april 2019 and july 2019 in january because the groundwater close to the lakeshore was frozen due to shallow water table and low air temperature saline groundwater samples were unable to be collected in the sampling systems instead eight lakebed pore water was collected in two sites about 5 m and 10 m away from the lakeshore using a push point sampler lake water was also sampled seasonally near the east and west lakeshore in april 2019 samples from three water columns were collected a total of 22 lake water 71 fresh groundwater and 24 saline groundwater were sampled 4 2 field and laboratory analysis oxidation and reduction potential orp temperature and ph were measured in situ using a calibrated portable multi parameter

isotope water analyzer iwa 45ep lgr co with an analytical error less than 0 5 for δ2h and 0 1 for δ18o 5 conceptual models our conceptual model is developed by considering a topographically closed hyper dry basin fig 3 shows the mass balance of lake water solutes for such a basin no solutes enter or leave by surface runoff solutes mainly enter the lake via groundwater flow evaporation pumps water out from the basin but solutes remain behind thus solutes are accumulated over time solutes may be lost from various processes including diffusion advection density dependent flow and mineral precipitation our conceptual model assumes that the lake water is well mixed this assumption allows the mass balance equations of solutes to represent the average status and still provides important information about the total amounts of solutes lost via downward transport and mineral precipitation given that the groundwater imported solutes lie in lake storage and lost from transport precipitation or decay the imported storage loss the coupled mass balance models of ba 226ra and cl are chan and chung 1987 stiller and chung 1984 1 f b a gw p b a lake 1 α v b a lake 2 f 226 ra gw p

different seasons more details are in the supplementary information about 226ra activities h and o isotopic compositions concentrations of major ions and ba ph orp tds and si 6 1 seasonal changes of 226ra h and o in fresh groundwater and saline lake water total dissolved solids tds of lake water are over 135 g l in july summer and slightly low 128 g l in april spring table 1 similarly the activity of 226ra in lake water has low activity in spring 100 to 450 dpm 100l and high activity in summer 550 dpm 100l δ2h and δ18o of lake water have the most depleted compositions in winter 30 06 for δ2h and 0 73 for δ18o during other seasons values of δ2h and δ18o range from 6 3 and 6 7 respectively the groundwater hydrogeochemistry also exhibits seasonality figs 4 and 5 the two sampling transects are both close to the lakeshore and hence the water table is shallow and subject to phreatic evaporation the average tds of fresh groundwater is about 0 5 g l in october and 0 38 g l in april the average values of fresh groundwater are 52 3 in october and 56 1 in april for δ2h and 4 2 in october and 5 2 in april for δ18o the average radioactivity of 226ra of fresh groundwater is 47 4 dpm 100l in october and 36 3 dpm 100l in april 6 2 saline groundwater field measurements show that the saline groundwater only exists near the west lakeshore in the east groundwater sampling transect all the samples are fresh even if the near shore three samples were collected below the lakebed these findings are consistent with former electrical resistivity tomography ert results which found that the saline lake water intruded into the south and west lakeshore aquifers and groundwater in the east lakeshore was dominant by fresh groundwater zhang et al 2021b the tds of sampled saline groundwater ranges from 2 2 to 80 2 g l in october and from 1 5 to 30 9 g l in april the isotopic compositions for δ2h and δ18o respectively ranges from 60 8 to 16 8 and from 6 1 to 3 1 in october and from 61 6 to 49 0 and from 6 2 to 3 3 in april the radioactivity of 226ra has a range of 11 1 392 9 dpm 100l in october and 75 5 127 1 dpm 100l in april the movements of the fresh saline transition zone in the west lakeshore also present a seasonality fig 5 the tds contour line of 1 g l moves towards lakeshore in april and away from lakeshore in october this process makes the groundwater samples collected from the same locations vary seasonally comparing fig 5a with 5b and 5c with 5d the values of δ18o and 226ra of the saline groundwater in october are much higher than those in april 6 3 evaporation dominated hydrogeochemistry the seasonal hydrogeochemical and isotopic dynamics of groundwater and lake water are mainly controlled by evaporation the groundwater recharge to the lake is generally high in winter and spring and low in summer and autumn wang et al 2020 the extremely high evaporation rate in summer and autumn effectively concentrates the solute in lake water while the lake water is diluted by fresh groundwater in winter and spring the lower values of tds δ18o and 226ra activity in saline groundwater are influenced by rainfall recharge and interaction with fresh groundwater the higher values of tds δ18o and 226ra activity are affected by the process of saline lake water infiltration and evaporation as shown in fig 6 a and 6d the fresh groundwater evaporation line and the mixing line between fresh groundwater and saline lake water are very similar it suggests that the lake water is the final product of fresh groundwater undergoing long term intense evaporation the fresh groundwater evaporation line and groundwater lake water mixing line are separated in the plots of tds versus δ18o in fig 6b and 6e respectively it indicates phreatic evaporation can cause intensive fractionation of δ2h and δ18o in fresh groundwater the evaporation process can also elevate the activity of 226ra the activity of fresh groundwater 226ra in october is significantly increased by evaporation compared with that in april fig 6c and 6f the seasonally forward and backward movement of fresh saline transition zone in the west transect mainly affected by evaporation from three aspects first in summer and autumn as the tds of lake water is increased and the density contrast is enlarged the intrusion of lake water into the lakebed is also intensified in winter and spring as the tds of lake water is diluted by fresh groundwater the downward transport of saline lake water is weakened second the high phreatic evaporation in summer and autumn decreases the groundwater discharge to the lake and hence the saline lake water intrusion is strengthened third the seasonally frozen soil can affect the location of the fresh saline transition zone though the maximum frozen depth is only 30 cm ning et al 2015 when the surface soil is frozen the phreatic evaporation is almost prevented and seepage faces of fresh water near the surface are blocked thus the hydraulic gradient pushes the fresh saline transition zone toward the lake to generate new seepage faces in the unfrozen nearshore lakebed as shown in fig 5b the interpolated tds contour of 1 g l is pushed lakeward in april 6 4 groundwater lake water mixing processes given the fact that evaporation line and mixing line in fig 6a and 6d are almost identical while the two lines are separated in fig 6b and 6e the mixing process of saline lake water and fresh groundwater is slightly affected by phreatic evaporation the δ18o is relatively conservative during the mixing process hence we use the mass balance of δ18o to quantify the proportion of the saline lake water flake and fresh groundwater fgw in saline groundwater zhang et al 2021b 7 δ 18 o gw f gw δ 18 o lake f lake δ 18 o s 8 f gw f lake 1 where δ18o gw δ18o s and δ18o lake are oxygen isotopic compositions of fresh groundwater saline groundwater and lake water respectively then the precipitation or production amount of ra d 226 r a dpm

theoretical endmember values of ra 226 ra lake and ba b a lake the positive and negative values of d 226 ra d b a represent the precipitation and production of 226ra ba respectively the results show that the precipitation or production rate of 226ra or ba in saline groundwater is generally positively correlated with the proportion of lake water flake in saline groundwater fig 7 a and b when flake is low 226ra and ba in saline groundwater are supported by desorption from the surface of solid grains when flake is large 226ra and ba are prone to precipitating the precipitation production ratio of 226ra to ba are also positively correlated r2 0 45 p 0 0003 fig 7c 6 5 salinization time as shown in fig 8 the 226ra and ba in fresh groundwater saline groundwater and lake water are closely related this gives us a clue how to quantify the co precipitation or co production 226ra and ba in lake water during salinization process based on the behavior of 226ra and ba during groundwater lake water mixing processes the saline groundwater of different tds can be used to represent saline lakes under different salinization stages and the linear relation between 226ra and ba in the saline groundwater can be ideally used to quantify the salinization time of the saline lake 11 p ba lake p 226 ra lake s s 100 μg dpm is introduced to solve the simultaneous eqs 1 6 by solving eqs 1 11 the analytical solution of salinization time τ is yielded to be 12 τ 1 λ ln 226 ra gw cl lake s ba gw cl lake cl gw ba lake 226 ra lake cl gw s this analytical solution can be employed to quantify the salinization time with the given concentrations of 226ra ba and cl concentrations in the saline lake water and the surrounding fresh groundwater and the linear correlation of the precipitation between 226ra and ba in saline lake water as shown in fig 7c s is estimated to be 0 64 100 μg dpm and other representative concentrations are also listed in table 2 the salinization time of the south sumujaran lake is calculated to be 7 843 years because the analytical error of 226ra measurements is less than 5 and hence the estimated salinization time should be 7 843 392 this value is much higher than that of 2 180 5 814 years using the cl mass balance model of lake water gong et al 2016 the large gap between the two calculated ages may be attributed to the downward transport of saline lake water it is obvious that our result could be more realistic and mechanistic by including solute loss via transports and precipitation by solving simultaneous eqs 1 6 the downward transport coefficient α is further calculated to be 0 106 0 005 which means that about 10 6 of the groundwater imported salts are transported into the lakebed aquifer over the salinization period the calculated salinization time is further cross validated by other dating approaches the organic carbon in the paleo lake sediments of south sumujaran was radiocarbon dated to be 7 843 392 years yang et al 2003 the lacustrine sediments are several meters higher than the present lake level it is likely this lake became saline shortly after its high lake level period moreover about 6 300 8 600 years ago fresh water snails planorbis radix auricularia and adarces occurred in these saline lakes of bjd wang et al 2016 it indicates that at that time most of the lakes were fresh and the salinization did not start the salinization time of 7 843 392 years is therefore reasonable and reliable as the salinization was usually initialized shortly after the freshwater period 7 discussion 7 1 implication for paleo hydrology the lake levels in the bjd reached the maximum about 6 300 8 600 years ago wang et al 2016 at that time the climate was much wetter than the present thus the lake level was about 6 36 m higher than the present and this period is called the pan lake period the prehistoric wet climate sustained the fresh lake and ecosystems when the climate became dry evaporation exceeded the precipitation the lake water volume was reduced solutes in the lake water were concentrated and therefore salinization was initialized it is speculated that the salinization of the lakes in the bjd started at the end of the pan lake period as the dry climate was intensified freshwater resources shrank and the salinization continued topographically closed saline lakes are common in dry climate environments in asia north america south america africa and australia yechieli and wood 2002 in these lakes groundwater is usually the main recharge previous researchers have studied the timescale for a lake changing from freshwater to saline water environments using sodium or salt mass as conservative tracers yang and williams 2003 zlotnik et al 2012 their studies assumed that 1 the lake is in equilibrium with climate under long timescale the impacts of climate variations on lake solute mass balance are not considered 2 influx solutes via groundwater and solutes in lake are under steady state conditions however the solutes in saline lake water are inevitably lost via chemical precipitation and dynamic advection diffusion and or density dependent flow hence this study tries to incorporate the solute loss via precipitation and transport when assessing the salinization time using the lake solute mass balance models our modification improves the precision of the quantification of salinization time 7 2 implications for mineral resources evaluation along with accumulations of ion contents in these saline lakes minerals e g calcite gypsum and barite are prone to precipitating when they are oversaturated fig 7c the results show that the si of aragonite barite calcite dolomite and gypsum in lake water are 2 5 4 1 2 66 6 0 and 1 6 respectively it indicates that these minerals are all oversaturated and will continuously deposit to the lake bottom on the other hand solutes in the lake water are transported into the lakebed aquifer due to advection diffusion or density differences the two processes induce significant solute sinks with the obtained salinization time solute sinks via precipitation and downward transports can be further estimated given that the pristine fresh lake has the same solute concentrations as the present fresh groundwater the masses m μg of solutes precipitated and transported into the aquifer can be calculated based on the mass balance equation 13 c gw v τ d c gw c lake v m where clake and cgw are the solute concentrations in the saline lake water and fresh groundwater respectively the average concentrations of ba li and sr in fresh groundwater are 35 9 and 398 μg l respectively and in lake water are 294 381 and 1611 μg l respectively the total precipitated and downward transported ba li and sr are finally estimated to be 428 21 105 5 and 4819 240 tons over the salinization process respectively these precipitated and transported chemicals are about 192 10 36 2 and 394 20 times as much as the lake inventories of ba li and sr respectively the concentrated solutes in the saline lakes provide us valuable mineral resources zheng 2001 saline lakes are normally regarded as the terminals of surface subsurface runoff but cannot be considered as terminals for salts due to the possible loss via downward transport and precipitation the precipitated and transported solutes are the function of salinization time and can be developed to be significant mineral sources in the arid lake basins 7 3 limitations and sensitivity analysis filed observation and si in lake water show that solutes in lake water are lost from downward transport and mineral precipitation the two parts are very important for estimation of salinization time of saline lake using solute mass balance model salinization process is dominated by climate variations the lake water level solute concentrations in lake water and fresh saline transition zone change seasonally or even in a longer timescale the calculation of salinization time in this study is unable to incorporate these variations but try to capture the average state of the lake on the present evolution stage sensitivity analysis of the calculation of salinization time is shown in fig 9 based on the measured values of different endmembers the calculated salinization time is sensitive to 226ra activities and cl concentrations in fresh groundwater and lake water but not sensitive to ba concentrations in fresh groundwater and lake water and the precipitation slope s in saline groundwater lakes in the bjd are mainly recharge by regional groundwater zhang et al 2021b which is slightly influenced by evaporation and has low solute concentrations in the two groundwater sampling transects most groundwater samples are affected by phreatic evaporation to eliminate the effect of evaporation it is necessary to choose the groundwater sample with the lowest 226ra activities and cl concentrations as the fresh groundwater endmember 226ra activities and cl concentrations in lake water generally change proportionally after we consider the seasonal change and spatial heterogeneity of 226ra activities and cl concentrations in lake water the salinization time is then calculated to be 8493 7 1559 years hence the precipitated and transported ba li and sr are about 208 38 39 7 and 427 78 times as much as the lake inventories of ba li and sr respectively the downward intrusion coefficient of lake water ranges from 0 21 to 4 8 this coefficient is sensitive to the salt inventory in the lake thus to improve the calculation precision more precise lakebed bathymetry and high resolution water sampling are needed salt dust emissions from the lakeshore of saline lakes are natural processes and influence the solute budget in the lake basin zlotnik et al 2012 in our conceptual model we focus on the solute mass balance in lake water once the solute leaves the lake water we assign this part to be precipitated or transported the lake water level will drop under dry climate conditions and the lake water inundated area is reduced that gives an opportunity for the salt in previous lakebed to exposed to wind blow salt dust emission is driven by wind and likely obstructed by lake bank slope hence the salt dust density in the lake bank soil is overall decreased with radial distance from the lakeshore zlotnik et al 2012 this part of salt may be flushed to shallow groundwater by rainfall infiltration wood and sanford 1995 shallow groundwater carries this part of salt back to the lake again our conceptual model does not treat this part of salt as being lost from the lake water in addition there are many kinds of salt cycles between the lake and ambient environments e g dissolution of precipitation minerals solute diffusion from the lakebed and recirculated solutes via density dependent flow to simplify these salt cycles we only consider the net solute sinks via these processes 8 summary this study developed an analytical solution for the salinization time of saline lakes and solute lost from precipitation and downward transports in arid environments hydrogeochemstry patterns in the groundwater sampling transects show the downward transport of lake solutes the δ2h and δ18o mixing line of fresh groundwater and saline lake water is consistent with the δ2h and δ18o evaporation line of fresh groundwater it gives us a clue that the saline groundwater with different salinity can be used to represent lake water at varying salinization stages hence we utilize the conservation of δ18o in mixing processes in the fresh saline transition zone to quantify the precipitation and production rate of 226ra and ba the precipitation rate ratio of 226ra and ba in saline groundwater are utilized to solve the 226ra ba and cl mass balance models in the lake water the salinization time is estimated to be 8493 7 1559 years the calculated salinization time is cross validated by other dating approaches the precipitated and downward transported solutes over the salinization time are further estimated to be 10 100 times of their inventories in the lake water the salinization time can characterize the initialization of fresh water

2704,stepped bioretention cells sbcs refer to multiple bioretention cells bcs built in series along slopes they are green infrastructures that can possibly be implemented on slopes however their optimal design has not been thoroughly investigated the use of multiple cells makes the design of sbcs distinct from that of traditional bcs in general the design of a single bc focuses on water distribution among different horizontal layers i e surface soil and storage layers while that of sbcs additionally focuses on water distribution among cells to examine the optimal design of sbcs this study constructed a physical model of sbcs and conducted eight representative experiments a numerical model was built calibrated and validated based on the experimental results and then used to evaluate the effects of design measures namely changes in the number of cells and installation of pipes i e underdrains and intermediate pipes intermediate pipes connect the storage layers of two adjacent cells four metrics were used to compare the effectiveness of design measures under various environmental conditions peak runoff reduction runoff volume reduction exfiltration and water distribution uniformity wdu the first three metrics reflect the overall hydrologic performance of sbcs while the last metric reflects the distribution of infiltrated water among the cells the findings showed that reducing the number of cells increased peak runoff reduction under less intense rainfall events and increased wdu underdrains significantly improved peak runoff reduction and runoff volume reduction but decreased exfiltration and wdu under all environmental conditions elevated underdrains encouraged more exfiltration than bottom underdrains intermediate pipes enhanced exfiltration but had a limited effect on peak runoff reduction however intermediate pipes decreased runoff volume reduction and even led to a poor wdu when underdrains were absent overall the findings suggest that sbcs are an effective form of green infrastructure for slopes as they provide comparable hydrologic performance 22 97 runoff volume reduction to traditional bcs keywords stepped bioretention cell slope landscape pipe installations water distribution uniformity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction urbanization has altered the natural environment in various ways such as by increasing impervious surfaces fragmenting green landscapes and accelerating habitat loss all of which have led to losses in natural resource pathways and biodiversity van der walt et al 2015 green infrastructures gis are effective in minimizing the adverse effects of urbanization they are on site green facilities that mimic the natural environment and restore the pre development conditions jarden et al 2016 woznicki et al 2018 gis can regulate stormwater and improve water quality by runoff infiltration filtration detention and evapotranspiration davis et al 2009 zhang chui 2020a although their effectiveness has been recognized gi systems have not been fully implemented worldwide some highly urbanized cities such as hong kong and singapore have proposed schemes for gi implementation lim lu 2016 but face the challenge of land shortage liao 2019 wang et al 2018 as the available area for gi construction is limited meanwhile urbanization has created a multitude of cut slopes in cities with rugged topography leung jiao 2006 these slopes may provide opportunities for gi construction given their substantial available area and low land cost in addition urbanization has gradually shifted from coastal areas to inland cities which could be in mountainous areas e g chongqing in china and pittsburgh in the us and thus also would benefit from gi installation mi luo 2018 therefore there is an urgent need to explore the possibility of building gis on slopes however installing gis on sloped areas is generally less effective than in flat areas as pointed out by studies on a variety of gi practices for example palla et al 2015 assessed the influence of slopes on the drainage capacity of permeable pavements and found that the runoff coefficient on a 0 5 slope was significantly lower than that on 2 and 3 slopes luan et al 2017 evaluated different gi applications in a mountainous catchment and found that gis were only effective in controlling rainfall events with 1 year and 2 year return periods the relatively poor performance of gis on slopes may be due to the fast runoff and reduced infiltration time when the terrain exhibits a steep slope the runoff driven by the tangential component force of gravity hou et al 2019 easily causes soil erosion and reduces the travel time of runoff and consequently results in less infiltration the general recommendation is to avoid installing gis on slopes where possible many design manuals recommend that 1 a suitable slope for gi construction is 6 and 2 the maximum slope should be no 15 center for watershed protection cwp 2009 environmental services division esd 2007 nevertheless given the growing demand for constructing gis on slopes specific measures for mitigating the adverse effect of slopes have been proposed and applied such as installing a level spreader and gi in the stepped form north carolina department of environmental quality ncdeq 2010 compared with the level spreader the stepped form of gi is more frequently discussed and adopted because it is applicable to various gi practices gi in stepped form involves the use of check dams or retaining walls to separate the gi occupied space into different sections along the slopes such that the space between the check dams or retaining walls creates a step such structures can be built either above the ground e g stepped bioretention cells sbcs or below the ground e g subsurface detention in permeable pavements hinman 2012 the term stepped is virtually synonymous with cascade chapman horner 2010 terraced doan davis 2017 and tiered shuster et al 2017 stepped gis have been broadly applied particularly in the form of sbcs the nw 110th street natural drainage system project in seattle usa which consists of 12 stepped pool bioretention cells bcs is an example of sbc construction on a 6 slope two year monitoring of the project showed that 48 to 74 of incoming runoff was lost to infiltration and evaporation under the condition of 48 runoff reduction the practice removed 87 63 67 and 80 of total suspended solids total nitrogen total phosphorous and total copper respectively chapman horner 2010 sbcs with two steps in omaha nebraska usa could reduce the inflow volume by 33 to 100 depending on the size of rainfall events strauch et al 2016 another sbc project in cincinnati ohio usa was built on a moderately steep slope of 13 the inflow was completely captured and total nitrogen was completely removed during small rainfall events 10 m3 alikhani et al 2020 even in steeper areas it is possible to implement sbcs the steep slope bioretention pilot project in mars hill north carolina usa was constructed on a steep slope of 53 tim ormond 2014 but the performance of this sbc project is still under monitoring an increasing number of studies have explored the optimal sbc designs alikhani et al 2020 studied the impact of a riser type outlet on runoff reduction efficiency within sbcs wang et al 2017 investigated nitrogen removal efficiency of sbcs when using different soil medias plants and storage depths however some key issues regarding the feature of sbcs such as the selection of optimal number of steps and the optimization of flow paths between steps have not been addressed in detail to the best knowledge of the author design guidelines also generally do not cover the design of sbcs this study aimed to assess the performance of sbcs when different design measures are implemented in response to various environmental conditions compare sbcs with traditional bcs and then identify the optimal sbc design to this end a physical model was constructed in the laboratory and eight representative experiments were performed a numerical model was calibrated and validated based on the results of the experiments and was used to simulate different sbc designs in this study the number of cells was varied together with the installation of two types of pipes underdrains and intermediate pipes intermediate pipes could connect the storage layers of two adjacent cells simulation scenarios covered all of the possible combinations of design measures and environmental conditions i e rainfall patterns and exfiltration rates to achieve a comprehensive comparison four metrics reflecting the main concerns of decision makers were evaluated peak runoff reduction runoff volume reduction exfiltration and water distribution uniformity wdu the first three metrics reflect the hydrologic performance of sbcs while the last metric reflects the distribution of infiltrated water among the cells which is associated with earlier clogging or pollution leaching a poor wdu may reduce the serviceability and longevity of the sbcs quantification of these metrics can help to identify the optimal designs of sbcs in different environments and provide some specific recommendations for sbc construction 2 materials and methods 2 1 laboratory experiment 2 1 1 physical model the laboratory setup as shown in fig 1 incorporated three bcs serially positioned at an equal elevation difference along a slope the total height difference 32 5 cm to the overall length 120 cm represented a 15 land slope each cell was 40 cm 40 cm and 30 cm in length width and depth respectively the typical design of a traditional bc always applies a depth ratio of 1 3 2 between the surface ponding the biosoil layer and the storage layer department of environmental conservation dec 2015 environmental services division esd 2007 the laboratory setup followed the same ratio as used in traditional bcs to ensure similar water redistribution among different layers to that end the depth was divided into the surface ponding 5 cm the biosoil layer 15 cm and the storage layer 10 cm from top to bottom the guidelines department of environmental conservation dec 2015 environmental services division esd 2007 minnesota pollution control agency mpca 2022 recommend that the planting biosoil layer comprise 50 60 sand 20 30 topsoil and 10 40 leaf compost a biosoil layer composed of a mixture of 60 sand and 40 compost was used to ensure a high infiltration the significant portion of compost enhances the water retention capacity carpenter hallam 2010 despite its risk of nutrient leaching the storage layer was filled with gravel with a maximum diameter of 3 cm two types of pipes were used in the physical model underdrains and intermediate pipes the underdrains in this setup were vertically installed at the bottom of each cell and differed slightly from the horizontal underdrains installed in real projects horizontal underdrains are designed to cover a large area so that adequate drainage can be achieved in some practices with a large length to width ratio or uneven bottom surface pujol et al 2020 this laboratory setup had a flat bottom surface and therefore vertical underdrains were sufficient for effective drainage and could be easily installed valves were attached to the outlets of underdrains they had two functions 1 fully open valves could simulate the case with underdrains and 2 partially open valves could simulate exfiltration in the case without underdrains the opening was adjusted to make the maximum flow rate when the cell is filled with water match our designed exfiltration rate note that exfiltration was almost negligible when there were underdrains which quickly drained out water intermediate pipes controlled the connection of storage layers between adjacent cells and allowed excess infiltrated water to be discharged to downslope neighboring cells one example of the application of sbcs with intermediate pipes is a project of the douglas county health centre bioretention garden strauch et al 2016 the working mechanism of sbcs is similar to that of traditional bcs except that the additional water in sbcs is transferred between cells flows can be diverted to downslope neighboring cells either over check dams overflow or through intermediate pipes infiltrated water as shown in fig 1 flows from underdrains and outflows from the last cell were collected into weir boxes equipped with water level sensors a calibrated head discharge curve was used to transform the water level into the instant flow rate 2 1 2 experimental scenarios current designs of traditional bcs primarily focus on the soil properties carpenter hallam 2010 liu fassman beck 2017 layer thickness and underdrains zhang chui 2017 and inlet configurations li et al 2020 these parameters should be applicable to sbcs as there are no changes to the vertical structure in this study extra attention was paid to the flow paths between adjacent cells table 1 lists eight representative experiments with various designs of pipe installations under two rainfall conditions note that intermediate pipes can substitute for the underdrains as they play the same role in water drainage it is therefore unnecessary to install both in the same cell this study primarily focused on large storm events as studies have already shown that sbcs with standard designs are effective in retaining runoff during small rainfall events alikhani et al 2020 chapman horner 2010 applying additional measures only marginally improves the performance of sbcs and seems to be unnecessary in this context in this study synthetic rainfall events with 2 year and 50 year return periods and a 1 hour duration were chosen based on the historical rainfall events in hong kong drainage services department dsd government of the hong kong sepecial administrative 2018 the average annual precipitation in hong kong ranges from 1400 to 3300 mm 80 of which occurs during the wet season from may to september the input flow was designed to ensure equivalence to real events equivalent duration and flow rate to enable comparisons between the laboratory setup and real events batalini de macedo et al 2021 with a capture ratio of 5 i e the ratio of the surrounding impervious area to the area of sbcs table 1 lists eight representative experimental scenarios with changes in the intermediate pipes underdrains and rainfall patterns for instance in the first experiment there were no intermediate pipes between cells all of the three cells were equipped with underdrain pipes and rainfall was set at a 2 year return period 2 2 numerical simulation model a numerical model of sbcs was built using the software green infrastructure flexible model gifmod gifmod can be used for modeling both hydrological and water quality processes of various types of gis massoudieh et al 2016 and can flexibly handle different model configurations a gi model in gifmod can be conceptualized into a combination of blocks e g surface ponding biosoil and storage and arrow connectors e g natural interfaces and pipes different head storage and head flow relationships can be applied to calculate the water storage in each block and the flow rate between blocks respectively gifmod has been successfully applied to simulate the hydrological processes of a bioretention system in cincinnati ohio usa alikhani et al 2020 massoudieh et al 2017 yang and chui 2020 applied gifmod to a stormwater management model to improve the simulation accuracy under various spatiotemporal scales fig 2 shows the conceptual model of sbcs in gifmod the three types of blocks are colored blue surface ponding yellow biosoil and gray storage the head storage relationship in the surface ponding blocks follows 1 h z 0 s a s where h l is the hydraulic head s l3 is the storage z 0 l is the bottom elevation and a s l2 is the bottom area of the block the head storage relationship in the biosoil blocks can be stated as follows 2 h h 0 θ θ s s s f o r s a t u r a t i o n z 0 h θ s θ α s e n 1 n 1 1 n θ θ s s s f o r u n s a t u r a t i o n where h 0 l is the top elevation of the block θ l3 l3 is the volumetric moisture θ s l3 l3 is the saturated soil moisture s s 1 l is the specific saturation s e is the effective saturation α and n are van genuchten soil retention parameters and h is the heaviside function the head storage relationship in the storage blocks is as follows 3 h s a s θ s ε s e n s θ θ s s s where ε and n s are matrix suction parameters for storage blocks under near dry conditions in fig 2 the yellow arrows represent the links of surface ponding soil blocks soil soil blocks and soil storage blocks which were governed by richards equation black arrows linking storage storage blocks and storage surface ponding blocks represent pipes and the flow rates in pipes were calculated by the hazen williams equation flows between the surface ponding blocks blue arrows represent relationships governed by manning s equation each column of blocks represents a single cell comprising vertically stacked blocks representing different layers and the elevation of each block is indicated within each box the biosoil layer is further discretized into three blocks so that the flow path within the soil can be monitored arrows between storage blocks represent intermediate pipes arrows linking storage and exfiltration blocks represent exfiltration while those linking storage and receiving water blocks represent underdrain pipes outflow is indicated by the arrow between the surface ponding 3 and receiving water blocks the dimensions of the numerical model strictly followed those of the physical model in the numerical model the elevation of the first ponding surface was set at 0 m and the exfiltration and receiving water blocks were maintained at the same constant head of 1 m based on the physical model the overall simulation duration was 3 h 2 3 calibration and validation model calibration and validation were conducted using laboratory results key parameters that were calibrated are listed in table 2 their initial ranges were either determined through laboratory tests or obtained from the literature the hydraulic conductivity k was obtained from constant head tests and ranged from 8 m d to 11 m d the slight variation in k was attributable to the combined effect of soil compaction and soil disturbance caused by runoff flushing the ranges of van genuchten parameters α and n were inferred from the literature liu fassman beck 2017 zhang chui 2020b the opening of valves simulating exfiltration was also calibrated and its maximum value was obtained from the measurements other pipe diameters were set at 2 cm similar to those in the physical model two inverse modules were embedded in gifmod for parameter estimation when observations herein flow rates were input gifmod automatically determined the correct estimations of the parameters experiments 1 4 5 and 8 were used for calibration and the remaining experiments for validation as listed in table 1 so that the same rainfall return period of 2 or 50 years was used in the calibration and validation the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient was calculated as a metric to test the goodness of fit between observed and simulated results 2 4 design measures the calibrated model was used to examine more scenarios with variations in the number of cells and installation of pipes fig 3 displays four illustrations depicting several simulation scenarios the design of sbcs should be based first on the proper selection of the number of cells as it directly affects the height difference between the cells fewer cells than the optimal number would result in large height differences and more lateral stress on check dams which would in turn increase the risks of soil erosion and structural instability in contrast more cells than the optimal number would increase the construction cost in the simulation cases with two three and four cells were examined as shown in fig 3a 3b and 3d the design of pipes in sbcs should consider both the intermediate pipes and underdrains in theory intermediate pipes connect the storage layers of adjacent cells which are originally sectioned by retaining walls or check dams such a connection enables the excess infiltrated water to be discharged to adjacent downslope cells fig 3a c and d show the setup with intermediate pipes while fig 3b shows the setup without intermediate pipes the design of underdrain pipes in sbcs is highly similar to that in the traditional bc however the existence of multiple cells makes the former situation more complex three cases were examined no underdrains underdrains at the bottom of the storage layer hereafter bottom underdrains and underdrains in the middle of the storage layer hereafter middle underdrains note that intermediate pipes can be a substitute for underdrains because they play the same role in water drainage the design measure specific for underdrain pipes could be applied to intermediate pipes if the underdrains are absent in the example shown in fig 3c the inlets of intermediate pipes in cells 1 and 2 have a relatively constant position i e the middle with respect to the underdrain pipe in cell 3 which conforms to the design of middle underdrains overall six patterns of pipe installations were examined no underdrains and no intermediate pipes nn no underdrains but intermediate pipes installed ni bottom underdrains but no intermediate pipes bn bottom underdrains and intermediate pipes installed bi middle underdrains but no intermediate pipes mn and middle underdrains and intermediate pipes installed mi these design measures were tested under different environmental conditions inflows were calculated from three synthetic rainfall patterns 2 year 10 year and 50 year return periods with a 1 hour duration high medium and low exfiltration rates corresponding to 60 30 and 15 l hour respectively were applied to the whole facility in total 162 simulations covering all possible combinations of design measures three cases in cell numbers and six cases in pipe installations and environmental conditions three cases in rainfall patterns and three cases in exfiltration rates were evaluated in addition a numerical model of a traditional bc was constructed with the same settings soil properties depth and area as the sbcs to allow an in depth comparison of these practices 2 5 evaluation metrics to evaluate the hydrologic performance of the sbcs two commonly used metrics were measured peak runoff reduction and runoff volume reduction gülbaz kazezyılmaz alhan 2017 yang chui 2018 exfiltration to groundwater is another important index as more groundwater recharge is desired in groundwater shortage regions dussaillant et al 2005 zhang chui 2020a moreover a newly proposed metric called the wdu was introduced in this study to assess the distribution of infiltrated water among cells and was defined as follows 4 wdu v min 1 n i 1 n v i where vi l3 is the water volume infiltrated in the ith cell positive when water enters soil and negative when water leaves soil vmin l3 is the minimum infiltrated water volume and n is the number of cells this equation is the ratio of the minimum infiltrated water volume of a cell to the average volume wdu normally ranges from 1 high uniformity to 0 low uniformity but some negative values would occur when vmin is 0 wdu is a commonly used metric in irrigation engineering where a poor wdu implies the potential for chemical leaching allaire leung et al 2001 accordingly in this study wdu in the sbcs was evaluated due to the concern of pollution leaching affecting pollution reduction in addition clogging is mainly dependent on cumulative flux and the sediment concentration yong et al 2013 intuitively compared with the other cells the first cell i e the highest cell of an sbc tends to receive the largest amount of water and probably clogs earliest which can reduce the serviceability and longevity of the facility this suggests that avoiding uneven water distribution is necessary making wdu a unique but crucial metric to be monitored in sbcs a two way analysis of variance anova excluding interaction terms was used to identify the effects of variations in the number of cells and the installation of pipes under specific environmental conditions the null hypothesis was as follows there is no statistically significant difference in evaluation metrics when design measures are implemented a p value less than the significance level of 0 05 was adopted to reject the null hypothesis 3 results 3 1 model calibration and validation table 3 lists the calibrated parameters figs 4 and 5 compare observed flows solid lines and simulated flows dash lines during calibration and validation these flows are the underdrain flows from each cell and outflow from the last cell overall the numerical model was able to capture the flow patterns of both underdrain flows and outflows it performed better for the 50 year rainfall pattern as compared to the 2 year rainfall pattern with nse coefficients ranging from 0 78 to 0 97 the major disagreements lie in the recession limb of the underdrain flows as figs 4 and 5 show simulated underdrain flows have a long tail in the recession limb whereas observed underdrain flows drop sharply to zero the mismatch may be partly attributable to the measurement error in the weir boxes during rapidly changing flow rates in this study weir boxes with orifices were used to measure flow rates as shown in fig 1 they can accurately capture flow rates that are relatively steady but may fail to capture rapidly changing flow rates despite this deficiency this measurement method was considered adequate because most flows in this study were relatively steady as shown in figs 4 and 5 3 2 effects on peak runoff reduction this section reports the effectiveness of changes in cell number and pipe installation in enhancing peak runoff reduction table 4 presents the p values obtained from the two way anova fig 6 displays the effects of design measures on peak runoff reduction the sbcs in this study exhibited a wide range of peak runoff reduction 5 65 the pipes had a significant impact on peak runoff reduction under all environmental conditions p 0 05 in table 4 the underdrains significantly enhanced peak runoff reduction from 3 to 15 to 44 67 as shown in fig 6a and 6c the effect of changes in cell number on peak runoff reduction heavily depended on the size of rainfall events showing a statistically significant difference p 0 05 in table 4 only under less intense rainfall events i e when the return period was 2 years reducing the cell number from four to two increased the mean value of peak runoff reduction from 30 to 49 as shown in fig 6b this improvement was not observed when the return period was increased to 10 years or 50 years 3 3 effects on runoff volume reduction this section reports the effects of design measures on runoff volume reduction fig 7 compares the runoff volume reduction for different pipe installations subplots a and c and cell numbers subplots b and d under various rainfall patterns and exfiltration rates the runoff volume reduction in the sbcs ranged from 22 to 97 similar to their effect on peak runoff reduction pipes significantly affected runoff volume reduction table 4 runoff volume reduction improved from 15 to 50 in the absence of underdrains to 85 94 in the presence of underdrains fig 7a and c the effectiveness of underdrains in controlling runoff volume was similar under all environmental conditions intermediate pipes had a limited effect on runoff volume reduction except for the scenario without underdrains the scenario of ni resulted in a smaller volume reduction than the scenario of nn fig 7a and c under all environmental conditions 3 4 effects on exfiltration this section reports the effectiveness of design measures in enhancing exfiltration fig 8 compares the exfiltration from the sbcs for different pipe installations subplots a and c and cell numbers subplots b and d under various rainfall patterns and exfiltration rates the exfiltration from the sbcs ranged from 8 l to 105 l the pipes had a significant impact on exfiltration under all environmental conditions all p 0 05 table 4 the exfiltration reduced from 50 to 100 l in the absence of underdrains to 10 60 l in the presence of underdrains elevating underdrain pipes from the bottom to the middle encouraged more exfiltration resulting in an additional 9 20 l of exfiltration fig 8a and c intermediate pipes were effective in enhancing exfiltration by 8 20 l when underdrains were installed fig 8a and c but had an opposite effect when the underdrains were absent 3 5 effects on wdu this section reports the effects of design measures on the wdu fig 9 compares the wdu for different pipe installations subplots a and c and cell numbers subplots b and d under various rainfall patterns and exfiltration rates the wdu was above 0 4 in most scenarios however the ni scenario exhibited a negative wdu value and is thus excluded from fig 9 the pipes had a significant impact on the wdu p 0 5 in table 4 underdrains generally reduced the wdu from 0 9 to 0 4 0 9 fig 9a and c changing the cell number was ineffective in improving the wdu under all rainfall patterns p 0 5 in table 4 nevertheless it was observed that the median wdu declined if the number of cells was reduced fig 9b this may be because the nn scenario introduced a large variation with some outlier wdu values approaching 1 fig 9b similarly under specific exfiltration rates reducing the cell number from four to two increased the wdu from 0 4 0 75 to 0 6 0 9 fig 9d 4 discussion 4 1 effectiveness of design measures the sbcs in our laboratory setup exhibited wide ranges of peak runoff reduction 5 65 and runoff volume reduction 22 97 under different design measures and environmental conditions which were comparable to those exhibited by traditional bcs e g 19 99 peak runoff reduction davis et al 2003 and 33 50 runoff volume reduction hunt et al 2006 runoff retention by the sbcs was slightly inferior to that by the traditional bc under similar settings as shown in table 5 the exfiltration 8 105 l and wdu 0 4 0 94 were also significantly influenced by the design measures and environmental conditions these findings suggest that changes in pipe installation had significant impacts on the four evaluation metrics of the sbcs under all environmental conditions while changes in cell number only influenced peak runoff reduction and wdu under specific environmental conditions in this study underdrains generally improved peak runoff reduction and runoff volume reduction but reduced exfiltration and wdu the elevated middle underdrains in the storage layer of sbcs encouraged more exfiltration than the bottom underdrains which is consistent with previous findings debusk wynn 2011 zhang chui 2020b peak runoff reduction and runoff volume reduction are often governed by exfiltration and underdrains provide an alternative route for water to leave the sbcs this explains why sbcs with underdrains performed better in peak runoff reduction and runoff volume reduction than those without underdrains however underdrains also removed excess stored water and even discouraged exfiltration in cases in which the sbcs were submerged these issues can be mitigated by elevating the underdrains elevated underdrains enable portions of water to be stored in the storage layer and exfiltrated gradually into surrounding soils collins et al 2008 moreover it was found that the absence of underdrains balanced the water distribution among cells i e increased the wdu probably because water would quickly fill up each cell without underdrains and each cell would thus have nearly the same amount of water the effect of intermediate pipes was dependent on the presence of underdrains intermediate pipes were effective in enhancing exfiltration particularly when underdrains were present this may be explained by the fact that the connection of storage layers allowed infiltrated water to be discharged to neighboring downslope cells so that exfiltration could occur in advance in the downslope cells surprisingly the intermediate pipes had opposite effects when underdrain pipes were absent namely decreased runoff volume reduction decreased exfiltration and even negative wdu values a possible explanation for this finding is that the infiltrated water from high elevation cells is under upward pressure to flow out from the surfaces of low elevation cells as shown in fig 10 this situation and design should be avoided because the upward pressure outflow may cause soil erosion consequently flushing out sediments and pollutants from the biosoil of the sbcs other designs such as a design with small underdrain pipes but large intermediate pipes may have a similar issue changes in cell number only had a significant impact on peak runoff reduction and wdu furthermore reducing the cell number slightly improved peak runoff reduction this minor improvement may be associated with the infiltration area in the traditional bc the infiltration process occurs constantly throughout the facility comparatively the infiltration process in sbcs begins in the first i e the highest cell and then gradually extends to the next downslope cells fewer cells result in more area for infiltration at the beginning and more infiltrated water however reducing the cell number did not enhance peak runoff reduction under intense rainfall events i e 10 year or 50 year return periods probably because the intense rainfall events filled up all cells immediately thus the area for infiltration was maximally utilized i e the whole facility was utilized meanwhile reducing the cell number increased the wdu a possible explanation is that with the increase in the number of cells the last cell in the sbcs tended to receive progressively reduced amounts of water compared with the upslope cells this suggests that increasing the cell number would introduce a large variation in the amount of infiltrated water among cells 4 2 concordance and conflicts between metrics the results showed concordance and conflicts between different metrics that is the improvement in one metric by one measure was likely to enhance concordance or degrade conflict another metric both the peak runoff reduction and runoff volume reduction were improved by underdrains but these two metrics showed opposite trends from exfiltration and wdu nevertheless elevating the bottom underdrains compensated for the reduced exfiltration and minimized this conflict no such conflict was observed between peak runoff reduction and wdu in different scenarios of underdrain installation in fact peak runoff reduction and wdu exhibited concordance in terms of improvement when the cell number was reduced no major conflicts or concordance was observed between the four metrics when intermediate pipes were implemented overall our results demonstrate that the optimal design of sbcs did not have the best values in all metrics given that conflicts were present between different metrics therefore it is important to identify the importance of each metric for different design objectives for example when water quantity control is the main objective priority should be given to peak runoff reduction volume reduction and exfiltration in sbcs designed for this objective it is recommended that the cell number be reduced intermediate pipes installed and underdrains elevated when there are concerns about pollution leaching or cell clogging particular attention should be paid to the wdu in such cases the cell number should be reduced and underdrains and intermediate pipes should not be implemented 4 3 implications when building sbcs on a steep slope the large height differences preclude the reduction of the number of cells in this case the large height difference between cells also results in the overflow being carried with a large momentum and energy easily causing soil erosion in the downslope neighboring cells therefore determination of the optimal cell number should be based on a trade off between the hydrologic performance of the sbcs and soil erosion underdrains are recommended to maximize the runoff retention capacity as fast runoff on steeper slopes would reduce the runoff travel time hou et al 2019 and rapid water accumulation can be hazardous to the downstream drainage system hadihardaja vadiya 2016 intermediate pipes may be unnecessary on steep slopes as the additional exfiltration afforded by these pipes may cause slope instability sbcs implemented following these guidelines would be particularly suitable for mountainous and space constrained cities although the primary objective of this study was to provide guidance on the design of sbcs the findings also have potential implications for stormwater management one might consider sbcs as a down scaled gi treatment train system because they share the feature of having multiple cells in series the findings from the sbcs in the current study can be extended to local treatment train systems for example the treatment train system in nashville north carolina usa consists of a panel of porous pavement and a bc brown et al 2012 if the storage layers of these two practices are connected by an intermediate pipe it is reasonable to infer that the exfiltration of the whole system would increase 4 4 limitations and future work this study has some limitations first no subsoil layer was used in the physical model and exfiltration was simulated by water drainage through the pipes and controlled through the value opening although this approach has been adopted in previous research it does not reflect the true process of exfiltration second during the beginning of the experiments the biosoil layers were nearly saturated due to low evaporation in the laboratory other antecedent conditions were not considered third this study only focused on individual rainfall events wdu is expressed as a function of accumulated infiltration and may have different values in the context of continuous rainfall there is abundant room for further progress in studying sbcs the properties of pipes such as their length roughness and diameter affect the flow rate and discharge volume how these properties and the relationship between underdrains and intermediate pipes affect the water balance should be investigated a long term analysis of sbcs incorporating non peak precipitation and various antecedent conditions is recommended to more comprehensively evaluate the performance of sbcs the findings of such a study would be meaningful in aiding decision making regarding sbc installation further the optimal number of cells depends on the slope angle due to concerns of soil erosion hence it would be worthwhile to examine the ideal number of cells for various slope angles 5 conclusions this study examined the effects of changes in cell number and pipe installation i e underdrains and intermediate pipes in sbcs on peak runoff reduction runoff volume reduction exfiltration and wdu under different environmental conditions the numerical model gifmod was suitable for modeling sbcs characterized by multiple cells and a complex configuration of pipes the simulation results showed that the design measures were effective in improving the hydrologic performance of the sbcs although none of the measures improved all four evaluation metrics simultaneously sbcs are a practical solution for gi implementation on slopes and can provide a comparable hydrologic performance to the traditional bc in flat areas some significant findings are presented below underdrains improved peak runoff reduction and runoff volume reduction but decreased exfiltration and wdu under all environmental conditions both elevating the underdrains and installing intermediate pipes enhanced exfiltration however installing intermediate pipes was not suitable for the sbcs when underdrain pipes were absent as this caused upward pressure outflow in the low elevation cells leading to soil erosion this outflow was associated with reduced runoff volume reduction and a negative wdu and possibly even with flushing of the sediments or pollutants from the biosoil of the sbcs reducing the number of cells alone improved peak runoff reduction and wdu but its effectiveness in terms of peak runoff reduction was limited under intense rainfall events these findings provide valuable insights into the optimal design of sbcs on slopes if the design objective aims to maximize hydrologic performance it is recommended that the number of cells be reduced and elevated underdrains and intermediate pipes be installed if avoiding pollution leaching or clogging is the main concern the number of cells should be reduced and underdrains and intermediate pipes should not be installed the ideal sbcs for a steep slope would be those with underdrains but without intermediate pipes in addition to providing guidance on the optimal design of sbcs the findings have implications for other in series systems of gi or treatment train systems because they share some structural similarities with sbcs i e multiple steps or practices credit

2704,stepped bioretention cells sbcs refer to multiple bioretention cells bcs built in series along slopes they are green infrastructures that can possibly be implemented on slopes however their optimal design has not been thoroughly investigated the use of multiple cells makes the design of sbcs distinct from that of traditional bcs in general the design of a single bc focuses on water distribution among different horizontal layers i e surface soil and storage layers while that of sbcs additionally focuses on water distribution among cells to examine the optimal design of sbcs this study constructed a physical model of sbcs and conducted eight representative experiments a numerical model was built calibrated and validated based on the experimental results and then used to evaluate the effects of design measures namely changes in the number of cells and installation of pipes i e underdrains and intermediate pipes intermediate pipes connect the storage layers of two adjacent cells four metrics were used to compare the effectiveness of design measures under various environmental conditions peak runoff reduction runoff volume reduction exfiltration and water distribution uniformity wdu the first three metrics reflect the overall hydrologic performance of sbcs while the last metric reflects the distribution of infiltrated water among the cells the findings showed that reducing the number of cells increased peak runoff reduction under less intense rainfall events and increased wdu underdrains significantly improved peak runoff reduction and runoff volume reduction but decreased exfiltration and wdu under all environmental conditions elevated underdrains encouraged more exfiltration than bottom underdrains intermediate pipes enhanced exfiltration but had a limited effect on peak runoff reduction however intermediate pipes decreased runoff volume reduction and even led to a poor wdu when underdrains were absent overall the findings suggest that sbcs are an effective form of green infrastructure for slopes as they provide comparable hydrologic performance 22 97 runoff volume reduction to traditional bcs keywords stepped bioretention cell slope landscape pipe installations water distribution uniformity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction urbanization has altered the natural environment in various ways such as by increasing impervious surfaces fragmenting green landscapes and accelerating habitat loss all of which have led to losses in natural resource pathways and biodiversity van der walt et al 2015 green infrastructures gis are effective in minimizing the adverse effects of urbanization they are on site green facilities that mimic the natural environment and restore the pre development conditions jarden et al 2016 woznicki et al 2018 gis can regulate stormwater and improve water quality by runoff infiltration filtration detention and evapotranspiration davis et al 2009 zhang chui 2020a although their effectiveness has been recognized gi systems have not been fully implemented worldwide some highly urbanized cities such as hong kong and singapore have proposed schemes for gi implementation lim lu 2016 but face the challenge of land shortage liao 2019 wang et al 2018 as the available area for gi construction is limited meanwhile urbanization has created a multitude of cut slopes in cities with rugged topography leung jiao 2006 these slopes may provide opportunities for gi construction given their substantial available area and low land cost in addition urbanization has gradually shifted from coastal areas to inland cities which could be in mountainous areas e g chongqing in china and pittsburgh in the us and thus also would benefit from gi installation mi luo 2018 therefore there is an urgent need to explore the possibility of building gis on slopes however installing gis on sloped areas is generally less effective than in flat areas as pointed out by studies on a variety of gi practices for example palla et al 2015 assessed the influence of slopes on the drainage capacity of permeable pavements and found that the runoff coefficient on a 0 5 slope was significantly lower than that on 2 and 3 slopes luan et al 2017 evaluated different gi applications in a mountainous catchment and found that gis were only effective in controlling rainfall events with 1 year and 2 year return periods the relatively poor performance of gis on slopes may be due to the fast runoff and reduced infiltration time when the terrain exhibits a steep slope the runoff driven by the tangential component force of gravity hou et al 2019 easily causes soil erosion and reduces the travel time of runoff and consequently results in less infiltration the general recommendation is to avoid installing gis on slopes where possible many design manuals recommend that 1 a suitable slope for gi construction is 6 and 2 the maximum slope should be no 15 center for watershed protection cwp 2009 environmental services division esd 2007 nevertheless given the growing demand for constructing gis on slopes specific measures for mitigating the adverse effect of slopes have been proposed and applied such as installing a level spreader and gi in the stepped form north carolina department of environmental quality ncdeq 2010 compared with the level spreader the stepped form of gi is more frequently discussed and adopted because it is applicable to various gi practices gi in stepped form involves the use of check dams or retaining walls to separate the gi occupied space into different sections along the slopes such that the space between the check dams or retaining walls creates a step such structures can be built either above the ground e g stepped bioretention cells sbcs or below the ground e g subsurface detention in permeable pavements hinman 2012 the term stepped is virtually synonymous with cascade chapman horner 2010 terraced doan davis 2017 and tiered shuster et al 2017 stepped gis have been broadly applied particularly in the form of sbcs the nw 110th street natural drainage system project in seattle usa which consists of 12 stepped pool bioretention cells bcs is an example of sbc construction on a 6 slope two year monitoring of the project showed that 48 to 74 of incoming runoff was lost to infiltration and evaporation under the condition of 48 runoff reduction the practice removed 87 63 67 and 80 of total suspended solids total nitrogen total phosphorous and total copper respectively chapman horner 2010 sbcs with two steps in omaha nebraska usa could reduce the inflow volume by 33 to 100 depending on the size of rainfall events strauch et al 2016 another sbc project in cincinnati ohio usa was built on a moderately steep slope of 13 the inflow was completely captured and total nitrogen was completely removed during small rainfall events 10 m3 alikhani et al 2020 even in steeper areas it is possible to implement sbcs the steep slope bioretention pilot project in mars hill north carolina usa was constructed on a steep slope of 53 tim ormond 2014 but the performance of this sbc project is still under monitoring an increasing number of studies have explored the optimal sbc designs alikhani et al 2020 studied the impact of a riser type outlet on runoff reduction efficiency within sbcs wang et al 2017 investigated nitrogen removal efficiency of sbcs when using different soil medias plants and storage depths however some key issues regarding the feature of sbcs such as the selection of optimal number of steps and the optimization of flow paths between steps have not been addressed in detail to the best knowledge of the author design guidelines also generally do not cover the design of sbcs this study aimed to assess the performance of sbcs when different design measures are implemented in response to various environmental conditions compare sbcs with traditional bcs and then identify the optimal sbc design to this end a physical model was constructed in the laboratory and eight representative experiments were performed a numerical model was calibrated and validated based on the results of the experiments and was used to simulate different sbc designs in this study the number of cells was varied together with the installation of two types of pipes underdrains and intermediate pipes intermediate pipes could connect the storage layers of two adjacent cells simulation scenarios covered all of the possible combinations of design measures and environmental conditions i e rainfall patterns and exfiltration rates to achieve a comprehensive comparison four metrics reflecting the main concerns of decision makers were evaluated peak runoff reduction runoff volume reduction exfiltration and water distribution uniformity wdu the first three metrics reflect the hydrologic performance of sbcs while the last metric reflects the distribution of infiltrated water among the cells which is associated with earlier clogging or pollution leaching a poor wdu may reduce the serviceability and longevity of the sbcs quantification of these metrics can help to identify the optimal designs of sbcs in different environments and provide some specific recommendations for sbc construction 2 materials and methods 2 1 laboratory experiment 2 1 1 physical model the laboratory setup as shown in fig 1 incorporated three bcs serially positioned at an equal elevation difference along a slope the total height difference 32 5 cm to the overall length 120 cm represented a 15 land slope each cell was 40 cm 40 cm and 30 cm in length width and depth respectively the typical design of a traditional bc always applies a depth ratio of 1 3 2 between the surface ponding the biosoil layer and the storage layer department of environmental conservation dec 2015 environmental services division esd 2007 the laboratory setup followed the same ratio as used in traditional bcs to ensure similar water redistribution among different layers to that end the depth was divided into the surface ponding 5 cm the biosoil layer 15 cm and the storage layer 10 cm from top to bottom the guidelines department of environmental conservation dec 2015 environmental services division esd 2007 minnesota pollution control agency mpca 2022 recommend that the planting biosoil layer comprise 50 60 sand 20 30 topsoil and 10 40 leaf compost a biosoil layer composed of a mixture of 60 sand and 40 compost was used to ensure a high infiltration the significant portion of compost enhances the water retention capacity carpenter hallam 2010 despite its risk of nutrient leaching the storage layer was filled with gravel with a maximum diameter of 3 cm two types of pipes were used in the physical model underdrains and intermediate pipes the underdrains in this setup were vertically installed at the bottom of each cell and differed slightly from the horizontal underdrains installed in real projects horizontal underdrains are designed to cover a large area so that adequate drainage can be achieved in some practices with a large length to width ratio or uneven bottom surface pujol et al 2020 this laboratory setup had a flat bottom surface and therefore vertical underdrains were sufficient for effective drainage and could be easily installed valves were attached to the outlets of underdrains they had two functions 1 fully open valves could simulate the case with underdrains and 2 partially open valves could simulate exfiltration in the case without underdrains the opening was adjusted to make the maximum flow rate when the cell is filled with water match our designed exfiltration rate note that exfiltration was almost negligible when there were underdrains which quickly drained out water intermediate pipes controlled the connection of storage layers between adjacent cells and allowed excess infiltrated water to be discharged to downslope neighboring cells one example of the application of sbcs with intermediate pipes is a project of the douglas county health centre bioretention garden strauch et al 2016 the working mechanism of sbcs is similar to that of traditional bcs except that the additional water in sbcs is transferred between cells flows can be diverted to downslope neighboring cells either over check dams overflow or through intermediate pipes infiltrated water as shown in fig 1 flows from underdrains and outflows from the last cell were collected into weir boxes equipped with water level sensors a calibrated head discharge curve was used to transform the water level into the instant flow rate 2 1 2 experimental scenarios current designs of traditional bcs primarily focus on the soil properties carpenter hallam 2010 liu fassman beck 2017 layer thickness and underdrains zhang chui 2017 and inlet configurations li et al 2020 these parameters should be applicable to sbcs as there are no changes to the vertical structure in this study extra attention was paid to the flow paths between adjacent cells table 1 lists eight representative experiments with various designs of pipe installations under two rainfall conditions note that intermediate pipes can substitute for the underdrains as they play the same role in water drainage it is therefore unnecessary to install both in the same cell this study primarily focused on large storm events as studies have already shown that sbcs with standard designs are effective in retaining runoff during small rainfall events alikhani et al 2020 chapman horner 2010 applying additional measures only marginally improves the performance of sbcs and seems to be unnecessary in this context in this study synthetic rainfall events with 2 year and 50 year return periods and a 1 hour duration were chosen based on the historical rainfall events in hong kong drainage services department dsd government of the hong kong sepecial administrative 2018 the average annual precipitation in hong kong ranges from 1400 to 3300 mm 80 of which occurs during the wet season from may to september the input flow was designed to ensure equivalence to real events equivalent duration and flow rate to enable comparisons between the laboratory setup and real events batalini de macedo et al 2021 with a capture ratio of 5 i e the ratio of the surrounding impervious area to the area of sbcs table 1 lists eight representative experimental scenarios with changes in the intermediate pipes underdrains and rainfall patterns for instance in the first experiment there were no intermediate pipes between cells all of the three cells were equipped with underdrain pipes and rainfall was set at a 2 year return period 2 2 numerical simulation model a numerical model of sbcs was built using the software green infrastructure flexible model gifmod gifmod can be used for modeling both hydrological and water quality processes of various types of gis massoudieh et al 2016 and can flexibly handle different model configurations a gi model in gifmod can be conceptualized into a combination of blocks e g surface ponding biosoil and storage and arrow connectors e g natural interfaces and pipes different head storage and head flow relationships can be applied to calculate the water storage in each block and the flow rate between blocks respectively gifmod has been successfully applied to simulate the hydrological processes of a bioretention system in cincinnati ohio usa alikhani et al 2020 massoudieh et al 2017 yang and chui 2020 applied gifmod to a stormwater management model to improve the simulation accuracy under various spatiotemporal scales fig 2 shows the conceptual model of sbcs in gifmod the three types of blocks are colored blue surface ponding yellow biosoil and gray storage the head storage relationship in the surface ponding blocks follows 1 h z 0 s a s where h l is the hydraulic head s l3 is the storage z 0 l is the bottom elevation and a s l2 is the bottom area of the block the head storage relationship in the biosoil blocks can be stated as follows 2 h h 0 θ θ s s s f o r s a t u r a t i o n z 0 h θ s θ α s e n 1 n 1 1 n θ θ s s s f o r u n s a t u r a t i o n where h 0 l is the top elevation of the block θ l3 l3 is the volumetric moisture θ s l3 l3 is the saturated soil moisture s s 1 l is the specific saturation s e is the effective saturation α and n are van genuchten soil retention parameters and h is the heaviside function the head storage relationship in the storage blocks is as follows 3 h s a s θ s ε s e n s θ θ s s s where ε and n s are matrix suction parameters for storage blocks under near dry conditions in fig 2 the yellow arrows represent the links of surface ponding soil blocks soil soil blocks and soil storage blocks which were governed by richards equation black arrows linking storage storage blocks and storage surface ponding blocks represent pipes and the flow rates in pipes were calculated by the hazen williams equation flows between the surface ponding blocks blue arrows represent relationships governed by manning s equation each column of blocks represents a single cell comprising vertically stacked blocks representing different layers and the elevation of each block is indicated within each box the biosoil layer is further discretized into three blocks so that the flow path within the soil can be monitored arrows between storage blocks represent intermediate pipes arrows linking storage and exfiltration blocks represent exfiltration while those linking storage and receiving water blocks represent underdrain pipes outflow is indicated by the arrow between the surface ponding 3 and receiving water blocks the dimensions of the numerical model strictly followed those of the physical model in the numerical model the elevation of the first ponding surface was set at 0 m and the exfiltration and receiving water blocks were maintained at the same constant head of 1 m based on the physical model the overall simulation duration was 3 h 2 3 calibration and validation model calibration and validation were conducted using laboratory results key parameters that were calibrated are listed in table 2 their initial ranges were either determined through laboratory tests or obtained from the literature the hydraulic conductivity k was obtained from constant head tests and ranged from 8 m d to 11 m d the slight variation in k was attributable to the combined effect of soil compaction and soil disturbance caused by runoff flushing the ranges of van genuchten parameters α and n were inferred from the literature liu fassman beck 2017 zhang chui 2020b the opening of valves simulating exfiltration was also calibrated and its maximum value was obtained from the measurements other pipe diameters were set at 2 cm similar to those in the physical model two inverse modules were embedded in gifmod for parameter estimation when observations herein flow rates were input gifmod automatically determined the correct estimations of the parameters experiments 1 4 5 and 8 were used for calibration and the remaining experiments for validation as listed in table 1 so that the same rainfall return period of 2 or 50 years was used in the calibration and validation the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient was calculated as a metric to test the goodness of fit between observed and simulated results 2 4 design measures the calibrated model was used to examine more scenarios with variations in the number of cells and installation of pipes fig 3 displays four illustrations depicting several simulation scenarios the design of sbcs should be based first on the proper selection of the number of cells as it directly affects the height difference between the cells fewer cells than the optimal number would result in large height differences and more lateral stress on check dams which would in turn increase the risks of soil erosion and structural instability in contrast more cells than the optimal number would increase the construction cost in the simulation cases with two three and four cells were examined as shown in fig 3a 3b and 3d the design of pipes in sbcs should consider both the intermediate pipes and underdrains in theory intermediate pipes connect the storage layers of adjacent cells which are originally sectioned by retaining walls or check dams such a connection enables the excess infiltrated water to be discharged to adjacent downslope cells fig 3a c and d show the setup with intermediate pipes while fig 3b shows the setup without intermediate pipes the design of underdrain pipes in sbcs is highly similar to that in the traditional bc however the existence of multiple cells makes the former situation more complex three cases were examined no underdrains underdrains at the bottom of the storage layer hereafter bottom underdrains and underdrains in the middle of the storage layer hereafter middle underdrains note that intermediate pipes can be a substitute for underdrains because they play the same role in water drainage the design measure specific for underdrain pipes could be applied to intermediate pipes if the underdrains are absent in the example shown in fig 3c the inlets of intermediate pipes in cells 1 and 2 have a relatively constant position i e the middle with respect to the underdrain pipe in cell 3 which conforms to the design of middle underdrains overall six patterns of pipe installations were examined no underdrains and no intermediate pipes nn no underdrains but intermediate pipes installed ni bottom underdrains but no intermediate pipes bn bottom underdrains and intermediate pipes installed bi middle underdrains but no intermediate pipes mn and middle underdrains and intermediate pipes installed mi these design measures were tested under different environmental conditions inflows were calculated from three synthetic rainfall patterns 2 year 10 year and 50 year return periods with a 1 hour duration high medium and low exfiltration rates corresponding to 60 30 and 15 l hour respectively were applied to the whole facility in total 162 simulations covering all possible combinations of design measures three cases in cell numbers and six cases in pipe installations and environmental conditions three cases in rainfall patterns and three cases in exfiltration rates were evaluated in addition a numerical model of a traditional bc was constructed with the same settings soil properties depth and area as the sbcs to allow an in depth comparison of these practices 2 5 evaluation metrics to evaluate the hydrologic performance of the sbcs two commonly used metrics were measured peak runoff reduction and runoff volume reduction gülbaz kazezyılmaz alhan 2017 yang chui 2018 exfiltration to groundwater is another important index as more groundwater recharge is desired in groundwater shortage regions dussaillant et al 2005 zhang chui 2020a moreover a newly proposed metric called the wdu was introduced in this study to assess the distribution of infiltrated water among cells and was defined as follows 4 wdu v min 1 n i 1 n v i where vi l3 is the water volume infiltrated in the ith cell positive when water enters soil and negative when water leaves soil vmin l3 is the minimum infiltrated water volume and n is the number of cells this equation is the ratio of the minimum infiltrated water volume of a cell to the average volume wdu normally ranges from 1 high uniformity to 0 low uniformity but some negative values would occur when vmin is 0 wdu is a commonly used metric in irrigation engineering where a poor wdu implies the potential for chemical leaching allaire leung et al 2001 accordingly in this study wdu in the sbcs was evaluated due to the concern of pollution leaching affecting pollution reduction in addition clogging is mainly dependent on cumulative flux and the sediment concentration yong et al 2013 intuitively compared with the other cells the first cell i e the highest cell of an sbc tends to receive the largest amount of water and probably clogs earliest which can reduce the serviceability and longevity of the facility this suggests that avoiding uneven water distribution is necessary making wdu a unique but crucial metric to be monitored in sbcs a two way analysis of variance anova excluding interaction terms was used to identify the effects of variations in the number of cells and the installation of pipes under specific environmental conditions the null hypothesis was as follows there is no statistically significant difference in evaluation metrics when design measures are implemented a p value less than the significance level of 0 05 was adopted to reject the null hypothesis 3 results 3 1 model calibration and validation table 3 lists the calibrated parameters figs 4 and 5 compare observed flows solid lines and simulated flows dash lines during calibration and validation these flows are the underdrain flows from each cell and outflow from the last cell overall the numerical model was able to capture the flow patterns of both underdrain flows and outflows it performed better for the 50 year rainfall pattern as compared to the 2 year rainfall pattern with nse coefficients ranging from 0 78 to 0 97 the major disagreements lie in the recession limb of the underdrain flows as figs 4 and 5 show simulated underdrain flows have a long tail in the recession limb whereas observed underdrain flows drop sharply to zero the mismatch may be partly attributable to the measurement error in the weir boxes during rapidly changing flow rates in this study weir boxes with orifices were used to measure flow rates as shown in fig 1 they can accurately capture flow rates that are relatively steady but may fail to capture rapidly changing flow rates despite this deficiency this measurement method was considered adequate because most flows in this study were relatively steady as shown in figs 4 and 5 3 2 effects on peak runoff reduction this section reports the effectiveness of changes in cell number and pipe installation in enhancing peak runoff reduction table 4 presents the p values obtained from the two way anova fig 6 displays the effects of design measures on peak runoff reduction the sbcs in this study exhibited a wide range of peak runoff reduction 5 65 the pipes had a significant impact on peak runoff reduction under all environmental conditions p 0 05 in table 4 the underdrains significantly enhanced peak runoff reduction from 3 to 15 to 44 67 as shown in fig 6a and 6c the effect of changes in cell number on peak runoff reduction heavily depended on the size of rainfall events showing a statistically significant difference p 0 05 in table 4 only under less intense rainfall events i e when the return period was 2 years reducing the cell number from four to two increased the mean value of peak runoff reduction from 30 to 49 as shown in fig 6b this improvement was not observed when the return period was increased to 10 years or 50 years 3 3 effects on runoff volume reduction this section reports the effects of design measures on runoff volume reduction fig 7 compares the runoff volume reduction for different pipe installations subplots a and c and cell numbers subplots b and d under various rainfall patterns and exfiltration rates the runoff volume reduction in the sbcs ranged from 22 to 97 similar to their effect on peak runoff reduction pipes significantly affected runoff volume reduction table 4 runoff volume reduction improved from 15 to 50 in the absence of underdrains to 85 94 in the presence of underdrains fig 7a and c the effectiveness of underdrains in controlling runoff volume was similar under all environmental conditions intermediate pipes had a limited effect on runoff volume reduction except for the scenario without underdrains the scenario of ni resulted in a smaller volume reduction than the scenario of nn fig 7a and c under all environmental conditions 3 4 effects on exfiltration this section reports the effectiveness of design measures in enhancing exfiltration fig 8 compares the exfiltration from the sbcs for different pipe installations subplots a and c and cell numbers subplots b and d under various rainfall patterns and exfiltration rates the exfiltration from the sbcs ranged from 8 l to 105 l the pipes had a significant impact on exfiltration under all environmental conditions all p 0 05 table 4 the exfiltration reduced from 50 to 100 l in the absence of underdrains to 10 60 l in the presence of underdrains elevating underdrain pipes from the bottom to the middle encouraged more exfiltration resulting in an additional 9 20 l of exfiltration fig 8a and c intermediate pipes were effective in enhancing exfiltration by 8 20 l when underdrains were installed fig 8a and c but had an opposite effect when the underdrains were absent 3 5 effects on wdu this section reports the effects of design measures on the wdu fig 9 compares the wdu for different pipe installations subplots a and c and cell numbers subplots b and d under various rainfall patterns and exfiltration rates the wdu was above 0 4 in most scenarios however the ni scenario exhibited a negative wdu value and is thus excluded from fig 9 the pipes had a significant impact on the wdu p 0 5 in table 4 underdrains generally reduced the wdu from 0 9 to 0 4 0 9 fig 9a and c changing the cell number was ineffective in improving the wdu under all rainfall patterns p 0 5 in table 4 nevertheless it was observed that the median wdu declined if the number of cells was reduced fig 9b this may be because the nn scenario introduced a large variation with some outlier wdu values approaching 1 fig 9b similarly under specific exfiltration rates reducing the cell number from four to two increased the wdu from 0 4 0 75 to 0 6 0 9 fig 9d 4 discussion 4 1 effectiveness of design measures the sbcs in our laboratory setup exhibited wide ranges of peak runoff reduction 5 65 and runoff volume reduction 22 97 under different design measures and environmental conditions which were comparable to those exhibited by traditional bcs e g 19 99 peak runoff reduction davis et al 2003 and 33 50 runoff volume reduction hunt et al 2006 runoff retention by the sbcs was slightly inferior to that by the traditional bc under similar settings as shown in table 5 the exfiltration 8 105 l and wdu 0 4 0 94 were also significantly influenced by the design measures and environmental conditions these findings suggest that changes in pipe installation had significant impacts on the four evaluation metrics of the sbcs under all environmental conditions while changes in cell number only influenced peak runoff reduction and wdu under specific environmental conditions in this study underdrains generally improved peak runoff reduction and runoff volume reduction but reduced exfiltration and wdu the elevated middle underdrains in the storage layer of sbcs encouraged more exfiltration than the bottom underdrains which is consistent with previous findings debusk wynn 2011 zhang chui 2020b peak runoff reduction and runoff volume reduction are often governed by exfiltration and underdrains provide an alternative route for water to leave the sbcs this explains why sbcs with underdrains performed better in peak runoff reduction and runoff volume reduction than those without underdrains however underdrains also removed excess stored water and even discouraged exfiltration in cases in which the sbcs were submerged these issues can be mitigated by elevating the underdrains elevated underdrains enable portions of water to be stored in the storage layer and exfiltrated gradually into surrounding soils collins et al 2008 moreover it was found that the absence of underdrains balanced the water distribution among cells i e increased the wdu probably because water would quickly fill up each cell without underdrains and each cell would thus have nearly the same amount of water the effect of intermediate pipes was dependent on the presence of underdrains intermediate pipes were effective in enhancing exfiltration particularly when underdrains were present this may be explained by the fact that the connection of storage layers allowed infiltrated water to be discharged to neighboring downslope cells so that exfiltration could occur in advance in the downslope cells surprisingly the intermediate pipes had opposite effects when underdrain pipes were absent namely decreased runoff volume reduction decreased exfiltration and even negative wdu values a possible explanation for this finding is that the infiltrated water from high elevation cells is under upward pressure to flow out from the surfaces of low elevation cells as shown in fig 10 this situation and design should be avoided because the upward pressure outflow may cause soil erosion consequently flushing out sediments and pollutants from the biosoil of the sbcs other designs such as a design with small underdrain pipes but large intermediate pipes may have a similar issue changes in cell number only had a significant impact on peak runoff reduction and wdu furthermore reducing the cell number slightly improved peak runoff reduction this minor improvement may be associated with the infiltration area in the traditional bc the infiltration process occurs constantly throughout the facility comparatively the infiltration process in sbcs begins in the first i e the highest cell and then gradually extends to the next downslope cells fewer cells result in more area for infiltration at the beginning and more infiltrated water however reducing the cell number did not enhance peak runoff reduction under intense rainfall events i e 10 year or 50 year return periods probably because the intense rainfall events filled up all cells immediately thus the area for infiltration was maximally utilized i e the whole facility was utilized meanwhile reducing the cell number increased the wdu a possible explanation is that with the increase in the number of cells the last cell in the sbcs tended to receive progressively reduced amounts of water compared with the upslope cells this suggests that increasing the cell number would introduce a large variation in the amount of infiltrated water among cells 4 2 concordance and conflicts between metrics the results showed concordance and conflicts between different metrics that is the improvement in one metric by one measure was likely to enhance concordance or degrade conflict another metric both the peak runoff reduction and runoff volume reduction were improved by underdrains but these two metrics showed opposite trends from exfiltration and wdu nevertheless elevating the bottom underdrains compensated for the reduced exfiltration and minimized this conflict no such conflict was observed between peak runoff reduction and wdu in different scenarios of underdrain installation in fact peak runoff reduction and wdu exhibited concordance in terms of improvement when the cell number was reduced no major conflicts or concordance was observed between the four metrics when intermediate pipes were implemented overall our results demonstrate that the optimal design of sbcs did not have the best values in all metrics given that conflicts were present between different metrics therefore it is important to identify the importance of each metric for different design objectives for example when water quantity control is the main objective priority should be given to peak runoff reduction volume reduction and exfiltration in sbcs designed for this objective it is recommended that the cell number be reduced intermediate pipes installed and underdrains elevated when there are concerns about pollution leaching or cell clogging particular attention should be paid to the wdu in such cases the cell number should be reduced and underdrains and intermediate pipes should not be implemented 4 3 implications when building sbcs on a steep slope the large height differences preclude the reduction of the number of cells in this case the large height difference between cells also results in the overflow being carried with a large momentum and energy easily causing soil erosion in the downslope neighboring cells therefore determination of the optimal cell number should be based on a trade off between the hydrologic performance of the sbcs and soil erosion underdrains are recommended to maximize the runoff retention capacity as fast runoff on steeper slopes would reduce the runoff travel time hou et al 2019 and rapid water accumulation can be hazardous to the downstream drainage system hadihardaja vadiya 2016 intermediate pipes may be unnecessary on steep slopes as the additional exfiltration afforded by these pipes may cause slope instability sbcs implemented following these guidelines would be particularly suitable for mountainous and space constrained cities although the primary objective of this study was to provide guidance on the design of sbcs the findings also have potential implications for stormwater management one might consider sbcs as a down scaled gi treatment train system because they share the feature of having multiple cells in series the findings from the sbcs in the current study can be extended to local treatment train systems for example the treatment train system in nashville north carolina usa consists of a panel of porous pavement and a bc brown et al 2012 if the storage layers of these two practices are connected by an intermediate pipe it is reasonable to infer that the exfiltration of the whole system would increase 4 4 limitations and future work this study has some limitations first no subsoil layer was used in the physical model and exfiltration was simulated by water drainage through the pipes and controlled through the value opening although this approach has been adopted in previous research it does not reflect the true process of exfiltration second during the beginning of the experiments the biosoil layers were nearly saturated due to low evaporation in the laboratory other antecedent conditions were not considered third this study only focused on individual rainfall events wdu is expressed as a function of accumulated infiltration and may have different values in the context of continuous rainfall there is abundant room for further progress in studying sbcs the properties of pipes such as their length roughness and diameter affect the flow rate and discharge volume how these properties and the relationship between underdrains and intermediate pipes affect the water balance should be investigated a long term analysis of sbcs incorporating non peak precipitation and various antecedent conditions is recommended to more comprehensively evaluate the performance of sbcs the findings of such a study would be meaningful in aiding decision making regarding sbc installation further the optimal number of cells depends on the slope angle due to concerns of soil erosion hence it would be worthwhile to examine the ideal number of cells for various slope angles 5 conclusions this study examined the effects of changes in cell number and pipe installation i e underdrains and intermediate pipes in sbcs on peak runoff reduction runoff volume reduction exfiltration and wdu under different environmental conditions the numerical model gifmod was suitable for modeling sbcs characterized by multiple cells and a complex configuration of pipes the simulation results showed that the design measures were effective in improving the hydrologic performance of the sbcs although none of the measures improved all four evaluation metrics simultaneously sbcs are a practical solution for gi implementation on slopes and can provide a comparable hydrologic performance to the traditional bc in flat areas some significant findings are presented below underdrains improved peak runoff reduction and runoff volume reduction but decreased exfiltration and wdu under all environmental conditions both elevating the underdrains and installing intermediate pipes enhanced exfiltration however installing intermediate pipes was not suitable for the sbcs when underdrain pipes were absent as this caused upward pressure outflow in the low elevation cells leading to soil erosion this outflow was associated with reduced runoff volume reduction and a negative wdu and possibly even with flushing of the sediments or pollutants from the biosoil of the sbcs reducing the number of cells alone improved peak runoff reduction and wdu but its effectiveness in terms of peak runoff reduction was limited under intense rainfall events these findings provide valuable insights into the optimal design of sbcs on slopes if the design objective aims to maximize hydrologic performance it is recommended that the number of cells be reduced and elevated underdrains and intermediate pipes be installed if avoiding pollution leaching or clogging is the main concern the number of cells should be reduced and underdrains and intermediate pipes should not be installed the ideal sbcs for a steep slope would be those with underdrains but without intermediate pipes in addition to providing guidance on the optimal design of sbcs the findings have implications for other in series systems of gi or treatment train systems because they share some structural similarities with sbcs i e multiple steps or practices credit
