salinity increase modeling of water management for cotton production in the cotton agro eco zones of uzbekistan is a challenge constrained by the availability and salinity of water this research presents a system dynamics model of water management for cotton production in uzbekistan causal loop diagram and stock flow diagram are hypothesized to generate the observed behavior of cotton

system dynamics modeling simulation 1 introduction cotton has traditionally been the main crop in the agro ecosystem of uzbekistan currently the crop occupies about 40 of individual farm areas but the output is declining djanibekov and petrick 2018 cotton production is also associated to various environmental issues water usage in agriculture accounts for almost 90 of uzbekistan s total water consumption of 56 km3 dukhovny and sokolov 2003 and high agricultural water use in cotton production puts great pressure on water resources causing regularly water inaccessibility djumaboev et al 2017 the use of water in the cotton monoculture cropping system is also linked the shrinking of the aral sea which has profound impact on the surrounding ecosystem shrinking aral sea has resulted in the increase in water salinity which has led to various issues ranging from the decline in fishery to infant mortality due to poor environment abdullaev et al 2009 to overcome the problems associated to cotton monocropping the government has issued a policy to reduce cotton areas where yields are below the country average such as in the mountainous and highly salinized areas these are replaced with other crops such as fruits and vegetables and fishery leonardi and sirtioglu 2019 in order for agriculture to be sustainable in uzbekistan it is important that the country implements an effective and sound water management policy to cope with its water scarcity water management in uzbekistan needs to consider the socio economic elements technology water stakeholders and the agro ecological systems and their complex interactions gain and giupponi 2015 martin et al 2016 failure to understand the complexity and interconnectivity of diverse sub systems within the water management framework makes it impossible for us to propose a sustainable solution davies and simonovic 2011 sivapalan 2015 other authors have also emphasized that policymaking in water management requires a comprehensive view comprising complex processes feedback systems and interrelations of multitude of factors gain and giupponi 2015 gohari et al 2013 j liu et al 2015 h liu et al 2015 mirchi et al 2012 sahin et al 2015 system dynamics presents us with the opportunity of capturing the interconnectivity of multitude of factors when examining the possible outcomes of various policy options several studies have been conducted on modeling of water resources to address policy issues nozari and azadi 2021 keyhanpour et al 2021 winz et al 2009 mirchi et al 2012 sušnik et al 2013 sahin et al 2015 forkutsa et al 2009a 2009b but none was found to utilize the system dynamics approach for cotton production we feel that it would be crucial to close this literature gap by conducting a study on system dynamics modeling of water management for cotton production considering the multiple properties of system dynamics approach one can enhance management commitment and minimize the likelihood of unintended outcomes of decisions made kelly letcher et al 2013 hence the identification of feedback relations and connection between the main system elements along with simulation over a long run perspective are necessary for the development of the cotton production model for agro ecological of uzbekistan water management for cotton production in uzbekistan must be modeled and simulated for clear understanding and decision making before its implementation water resources planning based on simulation is not about predicting the future however it can be used to explore what if questions and provide more information finally water resources planning is required for sustainable development and effective environmental management thus this study aims to improve our understanding of the dynamics of the cotton production system in uzbekistan through system simulations and assessments of the impacts of various policy options on cotton output and water sustainability 2 methodology planning and management of water for irrigation of cotton production systems in uzbekistan is a formidable challenge to our socio economic conditions since irrigation for cotton is constrained by the availability and salinity of irrigation water the water management for cotton production in uzbekistan is a complex dynamic and multi faceted bio economic system depending not only on available technology but also on biological economic and social factors experimentation with an actually existing water management system for cotton production systems containing biological economic social technological environmental and political elements is expensive and time consuming simulating such a system by a computer model one can conduct a series of experiments computer models clearly are of great value to understand the dynamics of such complex systems bala et al 2017 owing to the intrinsically complex nature of the water management for cotton production in uzbekistan it is advantageous to implement management policy options only after careful modeling and simulation of different policy options forrester s system dynamics methodology provides a foundation for constructing computer models to do what the human mind cannot do that is rationally analyze the structure the interactions and mode of behavior of complex socioeconomic technological and environmental systems bala et al 2017 system dynamics methodology is based on feedback concepts and multi loop nonlinear and time lagged complex systems can be handled easily fully capturing the nonlinear dynamic relationships is exceedingly difficult with traditional econometric techniques stephens et al 2013 also system dynamics methodology is best suited to the problems associated with continuous processes where feedback significantly affects the behavior of a system producing dynamic changes in system behavior discrete event system models in contrast are better at providing a detailed analysis of systems involving linear processes and modeling discrete changes in system behavior in agent based modeling information is exchanged among the agents to take appropriate actions and it is better suited for operational policy planning hence the system dynamics approach is the most appropriate technique to handle this type of complex problem a detailed description of the system dynamics methodology is given in forrester 1968 and bala et al 2017 the steps of modeling followed in this study are summarized in fig 1 in fig 1 the cotton production system dynamics model starts with the data collection data analysis dynamic hypothesis and causal loop diagram identification followed by constructing a quantitative model stock flow diagram details of system dynamics methodology are given in bala et al 2017 sterman 2000 2012 while a broad review of literatures on water systems is given in winz et al 2009 moreover the system dynamics methodology gives a broader explanation of how multifaceted systems change over time providing the dynamic aspects of such systems kelly letcher et al 2013 additionally the interactions of complex bio economic socioeconomic technological and environmental sub systems can be combined and accommodated within the existing model sušnik et al 2013 2 1 dynamic hypothesis the dynamic hypothesis is a conceptual model typically consisting of a causal loop diagram stock flow diagram or combination which drives the system s behavior when the model based on feedback concept is simulated the endogenous structure of the model generates the reference mode behavior of the system which results from the endogenous structure of the system in system dynamics modeling causal loop diagrams and stock flow diagrams are used to describe the basic cause effect relationships hypothesized to generate reference mode behavior over time sterman 2000 2012 water management for cotton production system can be represented by causal loop diagrams and stock flow diagrams and the simulation model based on the causal loop diagrams and stock flow diagrams can generate the dynamic behavior of the water management for cotton production system water adequacy water salinity and investment on drip irrigation in the form of causal loop diagrams and stock flow diagrams are hypothesized to generate the observed cotton area and cotton production in the reference mode in essence water resource water salination the cotton area the production and expected profitability which generate the dynamic behavior of cotton production systems in the agro ecological zone in uzbekistan 2 2 causal loop diagram causal loop diagrams are valuable qualitative analytical techniques to show interconnections among key variables that represent dynamic feedback structure sterman 2000 2012 the generic causal loop diagram of the water management for cotton production in uzbekistan is shown in fig 2 overall the conceptual model consists of 16 system variables which are connected to each other by 20 links the interactions generate 6 feedback loops comprising three reinforcing positive and three balancing negative loops these feedback loops capture the essential components of the cotton production system that is the water resource water salination the cotton area the production and expected profitability which generate the dynamic behavior of cotton production systems in the agro ecological zones in uzbekistan causal loop diagrams identify the principal feedback loops of the systems the causal loop diagrams are used to describe basic causal mechanisms hypothesized to generate the reference mode of behavior of the system over time a feedback loop contains two or more casualty related variables that close back on themselves the relationship between one variable and next in the loop can be either positive or negative a positive relationship means that if one variable increases the other also increases for example in fig 2 the arrow from water resources to water adequacy means that an increase in water resources causes an increase in water adequacy it can also mean if water resources decreases water adequacy will also decrease the arrow starting from water resources and terminating at water adequacy with a sign at the end of the arrow means the cause effect relationship is positive in a negative relationship the two variables change inversely for example in fig 2 the arrow in the direction of water resources to water salinity means that if water resources increase water salinity will decrease it can also mean if water resources decreases water salinity will also increase the arrow starting from water resources and terminating at water salinity with a sign at the end of the arrow means the cause effect relationship is negative one can easily determine if a loop is positive or negative by counting the number of negative relationship in a loop if there are an even numbers of negative relationships in total in a feedback loop then the loop is positive if there are odd numbers of negative relationships the loop is negative in fact positive feedback loops generate growth i e the loop is reinforcing and negative feedback loops are goal seeking the feedback loop structures of a system generate the dynamics behaviors of the system and in this study three reinforcing feedback loops as well as three balancing feedback loops generate the dynamic behaviors of the water management system net cotton area increase leads to an increase in cotton area r1 and consequently water adequacy decline as the capacity of the water resource is approached the water adequacy diminishes and the fractional net area increase will also decline loop b1 the cotton area continues to grow but at a slower rate until water resources are just scarce enough to halt the growth loop b2 water consumption by the cotton area creates a second negative feedback limiting loop area growth now cuts water adequacy by two ways by reducing the water resources available per unit area and by reducing total water resources simultaneously decline in water volume leads to an increase in water salinity which in turn causes to soil degradation which acts to reduce the fractional net area increase loop b3 the negative loops gradually gain in strength at some point when the net cotton area falls to zero and the cotton area reaches its peak the rate of decline of the water resources is at its maximum the water resources continue to drop water per unit area fall further and the net cotton area increase becomes negative total revenue increases with the increase of total harvest as a result more fund is invested on drip irrigation for cotton resulting more total harvest r2 and also the investment on the drip irrigation ensures more irrigation water for cotton production which also increases the total harvest r3 2 3 quantitative model development the next step of analysis is quantifying the causal loop mechanisms into a detailed simulation model the fourth process in fig 1 the feedback loops in the previous step are the key endogenous mechanisms which generate the dynamics of cotton production system in this study and the stock and flow diagrams provide the numerical basis of a sd model bala et al 2017 forrester 1961 sterman 2000 2012 the stock and flows are represented as a collection of stocks levels accumulations and flows rates respectively so material or energy accumulates in stocks and moves between them through flows bousquet 2010 ibragimov et al 2019 stocks are expressed mathematically as integrals and the inflows and outflows are change in the level of the stock over time and are influenced by current condition of stock levels auxiliary functions which can take on any large number of potential mathematical functions and delays each connected through an information link clouds represent sources and sinks here the ventana simulation environment vensim dss together with isee systems model building and simulation tool stella program are used the detailed flow diagram of the water management for cotton production in uzbekistan is shown in fig 3 the building blocks of the model are stock and flow the mathematical equations that describe stock and flow structures are represented by integral equations in form 1 s t o c k t s t o c k t 0 t 0 t inf l o w s o u t f l o w s d s where inflow s and outflow s represent the value of inflow and outflow respectively at any time between the initial time t 0 and the current time t in stella 2 s t o c k t s t o c k t δ t inf l o w δ t o u t f l o w δ t the building blocks of the model are stock and flow the stock is a state variable and it represents the state or condition of the system at any time t the stock is represented by a rectangle the flow shows how the stock changes with time and it is represented by valve symbol the flow with arrow towards the stock indicates inflow and the flow with arrow outwards indicates outflow the lines with arrow are influence lines and the direction indicates the direction of information flow the variable factor at the starting point indicates the variable factor affecting the variable factor at the terminating point and this in essence shows how one variable factor influences other variable factor with direction of information flow in fig 3 cotton area is a stock variable and expansion rate and cotton to wheat conversion are inflow and outflow respectively into the stock cotton area fundamental equations that correspond to major state variables shown in fig 3 are as follows one of the major changes made to uzbek agricultural policy after the independence is to reconsider national food security and achieve grain wheat sufficiency the uzbek government mandated a reduction of cotton production and an increase in that of wheat abdullaev et al 2009 cotton area is increased by expansion rate and decreased by conversion of cotton area into wheat area and this relationship can be expressed as 3 cotton area integ expansion rate cotton to wheat conversion initial cotton area the expansion rate depends on desired expansion rate and expansion delay and it can be expressed as 4 expansion rate desired expansion rate expansion delay expansion delay 1 conversion of cotton area into wheat area can be expressed as 5 cotton to wheat conversion smooth if then else time 2000 0 depletion fraction 2 the water volume change over time and it is increased by inflow and decreased by outflow and the relationship is expressed as gaybullaev et al 2012 6 water resources integ inflow outflow initial water resources the inflow is computed as a summation of precipitation and river runoff 7 inflow presipitation river runoff the outflow is computed as a summation of evaporation water requirement of cotton and water requried per ha wheat area 8 outflow evaporation water requirement of cotton water required per ha wheat area water requirement is computed from cotton area and water required per ha cotton area as 9 water requirement cotton area x water required per ha cotton area the cotton receives 10 000 m 3 of water per hectare and the current area is about 35 of agricultural water use in the country abdullaev et al 2009 and it is expressed as water required per ha cotton area 10 000 relative water resource is the ratio of water resources to normal water resources and it is expressed as 10 relative water resource water resources normal water resources depletion fraction is computed from normal cotton area depletion and effect of relative water on depletion rate as 11 depletion fraction normal cotton area depletion x effect of relative water on depletion rate normal cotton area depletion is zero before time 1980 and 50000 from time 1980 and it is controlled by government regulation over cotton and it can be expressed as 12 normal cotton area depletion if then else time 1982 50000 0 x government regulation over cotton the relationship between the effect of relative water on depletion rate and relative water resources is expressed as a graphical function as shown in fig 4 the horizontal axis is relative water resources defined on a scale from zero to one the general shape is that the effect of relative water on depletion rate is unity till the relative water resources approaches 0 50 and then it has a steep downward slope as relative water resources increases the effect becomes weaker a relative water resources of 0 75 depletes the cotton area to 45 of what the area could otherwise be decreased when relative water resources is equal or greater than one then water availability is satisfied and the effect takes a value of 0 0 which means no area decline the graphical function is expressed as 13 effect of relative water on depletion rate graph relative water resource f 0 0 00 1

salinity reference salinity x effect of relative water on water salinity the water salinity level was 10 g l gaybullaev et al 2012 in the reference year and is expressed as follows reference salinity 10 the higher relative water resource the less is the water salination this relationship is shown graphically in fig 5 as relative water resource increases from zero to 0 4 the effect of relative water on water salinity decreases from 13 to 3 85 times and as relative water resource increases even further to 0 8 the effect of relative water on water salinity decreases to 1 5 times finally as the relative water resource increases to one the effect gradually approaches a numerical value of one this relationship can be expressed as 15 effect of relative water on water salinity graph relative

reperesents that the salinity effect is balanced by precipitation river runoff evaporation the effect takes a numerical 1 0 implying that it is an uninterrupted area expansion as the indicated salinity increases the effect becomes stronger an indicated salinity of 11 g l reduces the cotton area expansion to 75 of what could otherwise be expanded an indicated salinity of 20 g l is completely intolerable and reduces the area expansion to zero this relationship is expressed by a graphical function as 17 effect of salinity on area expansion graph indicated salinity f 0 10 00 1 00 11 00 0 75

are solved numerically using runge kutta forth order method using the software stella the solution interval was taken to 0 25 which is less than half of the shortest first order delay 3 results and discussions 3 1 data collection data used in this model were collected from interviews published litarature and government reports the initial values and parameter values are estimated from the primary and secondary data collected from these reports and interviews for model validation the values of some key parameters and variables used in the model are presented in table 1 3 2 model validation to build up confidence in the predictions of the model various ways of validating a model such as comparing the model predictions with historic data checking whether the model generates plausible behavior and checking the quality of the parameter values were considered tests for building confidence in the model were conducted to demonstrate the potentiality of the model tests for building confidence in the system dynamics models essentially consist of validation sensitivity analysis and policy analysis bala et al 2017 two important notions of the building confidence in the system dynamics models are testing and validation of the system dynamics models testing means the comparison of a model to empirical reality for accepting or rejecting the model and validation means the process of establishing confidence in the soundness and usefulness of the model in the behavioral validity tests emphasis should be on the behavioral patterns rather than an point prediction barlas 1996 researchers grant et al 1997 vanclay and skovsgaard 1997 have advocated the terminology model evaluation instead of model validation the term emphasizes relative utility of a model a model that is useful for one purpose may be misleading for other purposes fig 7 shows the comparison of simulated cotton area of uzbekistan from 1960 to 2017 with the observed data also fig 8 shows the comparison of the simulated total cotton with reported values the basic patterns and data of the simulated behavior adequately agree with the observed pattern and data also the model generates plausible behavior thus the model can predict the dynamic behavior of the water management system for cotton production in uzbekistan the validated model was used as a baseline scenario for policy analysis table 2 provides further evidence of the simulated behavior in this table the summary statistics for the cotton area and total cotton production are listed and the theil 1 1 the theil statistics show the overall error and it is decomposed into um us and uc fraction of error into bias unequal variation and unequal covariance respectively j sterman 2000 j d sterman 2000 inequality statistics is decomposed as suggested by sterman 2000 2012 regarding fig 7 not only is the root mean square percent error rmspe remarkably low with 7 deviation to the historical value but also almost 60 of this error is due to unsystematic error uc implying that trend mean and variance are similar in both historical and simulated data and most of the error stemmed from unequal covariation athe rmspe standardized measure of the magnitude of the error the rmspe for total cotton area was 8 the majority of the error was due to unequal covariation 88 and the error attributable to unequal variation was 11 the unequal variation component of the error was 1 this result indicates that the model captures the mean value and main changes in the historical data precisely as depicted in fig 8 a better fit was prohibited by the high sensitivity to the state level policy shift of cotton mandate though the authors found the reproduced outcomes sufficiently good to support the dynamic hypothesis of the cotton production system we conducted multivariate sensitivity analysis to test the robustness of the simulation outcomes to assumptions over the range of uncertainty fig 9 shows the results of multivariate sensitivity analysis of the cotton production model the figure shows the 50 75 95 and 100 confidence bounds for total cotton production in a sample of 200 simulations salinity water required per ha cotton area normal expansion river runoff precipitation and evaporation are all distributed independently with deviations of about 30 of their base values there is a 95 chance that total cotton production will be between about 1 7 and 5 6 million t y in year 2004 and 100 chance that total cotton production will be between 2 3 and 3 8 million t y 3 3 scenarios for policy analysis in this study four policy options are considered to assess the management strategies and explore their impacts on cotton production farmers profitability and conservation of water resources besides baseline four policy scenarios were developed to assess their impacts on water demands crop production and net farm income the description of policy options and scenarios are summarized in table 3 and these are as follows 3 3 1 policy option 1 s1 the investment in drip irrigation which is based on the presidential decree no 5742 of 06 17 2019 for the efficient use of land and water resources in agriculture 3 3 2 policy option 2 s2 removal of price controls which implies that the cotton farm gate prices to be at levels that guarantee positive returns to farmers even though interventions to achieve such objectives are complex and involve multi stakeholder decision making 3 3 3 policy option 3 s3 crop productivity is increased through r d and cotton productivity growth is necessary for maintaining farmer incomes and improving the international competitiveness of domestic cotton based industries moreover with increasing pressure on the water resources long term sustainability in cotton production and the ongoing competitiveness of the cotton sector will depend mostly on increases in crop productivity per unit of area 3 3 4 policy option 4 policy mix s1 s2 s3 policy mix is a policy option of the combination of the policy s1 s2 and s3 the simulation results of above policy scenarios for 31 years starting from 2019 are discussed here 3 3 5 simulated scenarios of the water requirements under different policy options fig 10 shows simulates scenarios of the water requirements of cotton under different policy options the water requirement of cotton shows a sharp decline over the past three decades it shows a decline in water requirement from 20 km 3 y in 1991 12 km 3 y in 2003 and then it flattens out onwards until 2019 for all the policy options water requirement of cotton is then moderately reduced from12 km 3 y in 2019 to about 7 km 3 y in 2003 for the policy options s1 and policy mix while it remains unchanged for the policy options s2 and s3 reduced water requirement of cotton is due to the adoption of water saving technology such as drip irrigation drip irrigation based on a micro irrigation system has the capability to save water and minerals permitting inflow of water at the roots of crops thus it is expected that the total water requirement of the cotton is reduced to about 4 9 km 3 y at the end of the simulation period the system is therefore advantageous not only in terms of the saving of water resources but also due to the recovery of land soil energy labor fuel and mineral fertilizer savings and decreased greenhouse gas emissions 3 3 6 simulated scenarios of the total cotton production under different policy options fig 11 portrays the simulation outcomes for total cotton production scenarios for the baseline s1 s2 s3 and policy mix for a simulation period of 31 years the cotton production declined exponentially from slightly above 5 million t y in 1991 to about 3 million t y in 2005 for the baseline and policy option s2 for a simulation period of a 31 years it increases from 3 million t y in 2019 3 47 million t y for policy option s3 in 2020 which is about 15 6 higher than 3 million t y under the scenarios baseline and s2 policy option s1 shows slightly better result with an increase of cotton production to 3 93 million t y in 2020 which is 31 and 13 2 higher than 3 million t y and 3 47 million t y for the baseline and policy option s3 respectively these results again suggest that investment in drip irrigation is a rational decision although the cotton production performs well for the policy option s1 it even grows at a much higher rate under the policy mix scenario in comparison to all the policy options thus this policy option is favorable due to investment in drip irrigation and increasing yield through r d resulting in much higher cotton production the policy options s2 alone does not contribute to the total cotton production after 2005 the earlier maturing of cotton has been experienced when drip irrigation is implemented 3 3 7 simulated scenarios of the profitability under different policy options fig 12 shows the simulated cotton profitability scenarios under the four policy options for a simulation period of a 31 years the sharp decline in profitability scenarios for policy options s1 and s1 s2 s3 in 2020 due to high investment in drip irrigation system niyazmetov and rudenko 2013 reported that the investment for the installation of the drip irrigation system was 88 4 million soums per 10 ha the effect of price control withdrawal s2 compensates the effect of productivity improvement s3 in terms of profitability the cotton export in the country is strictly monitored this regulation inhibits world cotton price transmission and induce raw materials to be transferred from suppliers by the government or semi governmental firms macdonald 2012 and cotton prices were fixed as a percentage of world cotton prices varying between 70 and 85 sadler 2006 the cotton price under scenario s2 is increased to the same level of current world cotton price while the cotton productivity per ha is changed exogenously to the maximum economic potential level the policy option s1 is the worst policy and the positive profitability starts in 2039 and the policy mix s1 s2 s3 is the most efficient policy option the profitability of policy options s2 and s3 are similar but the policy s2 is slightly better than policy s3 the investment in drip irrigation s1 price control withdrawal s2 and productivity increase s3 is not efficient when considered in isolation 4 policy implications the cotton production in uzbekistan needs development strategies to improve water use efficiency production and profitability in the long term our simulation results support the following policy implications the drip irrigation system has higher positive impacts not only in terms of cost reduction but also through savings of water resources increased productivity and decreased greenhouse gas emissions and hence investment for drip irrigation needs priority attention for sustainability in the long run perspective our findings also suggest that the price paid by the government to farmers should be market based with the purpose of providing full incentives including higher positive net return attributable to the excessive level of cotton water consumption more investment for research to develop a new breed of cotton of much more productivity needs priority attention training and extension services should be fostered to enhance the productivity at farm levels through a participatory way of learning by doing of the farmers field schools and it is essential for dissemination of cutting edge technologies diversification should be practiced with more priority on less water consuming highly profitable and environmentally friendly cropping structure finally the favorable policy of the sustainable cotton production entails cotton farm gate price to be based on world cotton price investment in drip irrigation and r d simultaneously 5 conclusions cotton is the main crop in uzbekistan declining of cotton area and tremendous pressure on water resources for cotton irrigation are major concerns for policy makers the overshoot and collapse of cotton production is one of the outcomes of the short term profit at the cost of reducing the societal and ecological well being thereby increasing salinity level reduction in net return with the demolition of several economic activities reliant on water habitats for vegetation and wild life this study is designed to assess policy issues such as investment on drip irrigation cotton price liberalization productivity improvement and a policy mix which is a combination of these policies the mix policy is the most efficient policy among the policy issues investment on drip irrigation along with liberalization of cotton price and improvement in crop productivity is needed for policy implementation the drip irrigation policy proposed helps save significant amount of water consumption which can be accomplished by controlled frequency of water flow and quantity in line with the requirements of crops with no water loss and evaporation based on the simulation results it is apparent that farm supports are essential to help farmers adopt water saving technologies to maintain their income and biodiversity to promote the farmers to adopt water saving technologies initial financial aid is needed in terms of minimizing the cost of equipment to improve the crop productivity research and development programs for high yielding and hybrid cotton should be strengthened this model can be extended further to include the transfer of the high mountainous areas of water scarcity into the areas of fruits and vegetables production and the transfer of high saline areas into fisheries areas along with investments on modernization of cotton production using machine picking and modern ginning this study is recommended for further research and the model developed can be used as a computer laboratory with certain modifications of the existing model declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper

of water management for cotton production considering the multiple properties of system dynamics approach one can enhance management commitment and minimize the likelihood of unintended outcomes of decisions made kelly letcher et al 2013 hence the identification of feedback relations and connection between the main system elements along with simulation over a long run perspective are necessary for the development of the cotton production model for agro ecological of uzbekistan water management for cotton production in uzbekistan must be modeled and simulated for clear understanding and decision making before its implementation water resources planning based on simulation is not about predicting the future however it can be used to explore what if questions and provide more information finally water resources planning is required for sustainable development and effective environmental management thus this study aims to improve our understanding of the dynamics of the cotton production system in uzbekistan through system simulations and assessments of the impacts of various policy options on cotton output and water sustainability 2 methodology planning and management of water for irrigation of cotton production systems in uzbekistan is a formidable challenge to our socio economic conditions since irrigation for cotton is constrained by the availability and salinity of irrigation water the water management for cotton production in uzbekistan is a complex dynamic and multi faceted bio economic system depending not only on available technology but also on biological economic and social factors experimentation with an actually existing water management system for cotton production systems containing biological economic social technological environmental and political elements is expensive and time consuming simulating such a system by a computer model one can conduct a series of experiments computer models clearly are of great value to understand the dynamics of such complex systems bala et al 2017 owing to the intrinsically complex nature of the water management for cotton production in uzbekistan it is advantageous to implement management policy options only after careful modeling and simulation of different policy options forrester s system dynamics methodology provides a foundation for constructing computer models to do what the human mind cannot do that is rationally analyze the structure the interactions and mode of behavior of complex socioeconomic technological and environmental systems bala et al 2017 system dynamics methodology is based on feedback concepts and multi loop nonlinear and time lagged complex systems can be handled easily fully capturing the nonlinear dynamic relationships is exceedingly difficult with traditional econometric techniques stephens et al 2013 also system dynamics methodology is best suited to the problems associated with continuous processes where feedback significantly affects the behavior of a system producing dynamic changes in system behavior discrete event system models in contrast are better at providing a detailed analysis of systems involving linear processes and modeling discrete changes in system behavior in agent based modeling information is exchanged among the agents to take appropriate actions and it is better suited for operational policy planning hence the system dynamics approach is the most appropriate technique to handle this type of complex problem a detailed description of the system dynamics methodology is given in forrester 1968 and bala et al 2017 the steps of modeling followed in this study are summarized in fig 1 in fig 1 the cotton production system dynamics model starts with the data collection data analysis dynamic hypothesis and causal loop diagram identification followed by constructing a quantitative model stock flow diagram details of system dynamics methodology are given in bala et al 2017 sterman 2000 2012 while a broad review of literatures on water systems is given in winz et al 2009 moreover the system dynamics methodology gives a broader explanation of how multifaceted systems change over time providing the dynamic aspects of such systems kelly letcher et al 2013 additionally the interactions of complex bio economic socioeconomic technological and environmental sub systems can be combined and accommodated within the existing model sušnik et al 2013 2 1 dynamic hypothesis the dynamic hypothesis is a conceptual model typically consisting of a causal loop diagram stock flow diagram or combination which drives the system s behavior when the model based on feedback concept is simulated the endogenous structure of the model generates the reference mode behavior of the system which results from the endogenous structure of the system in system dynamics modeling causal loop diagrams and stock flow diagrams are used to describe the basic cause effect relationships hypothesized to generate reference mode behavior over time sterman 2000 2012 water management for cotton production system can be represented by causal loop diagrams and stock flow diagrams and the simulation model based on the causal loop diagrams and stock flow diagrams can generate the dynamic behavior of the water management for cotton production system water adequacy water salinity and investment on drip irrigation in the form of causal loop diagrams and stock flow diagrams are hypothesized to generate the observed cotton area and cotton production in the reference mode in essence water resource water salination the cotton area the production and expected profitability which generate the dynamic behavior of cotton production systems in the agro ecological zone in uzbekistan 2 2 causal loop diagram causal loop diagrams are valuable qualitative analytical techniques to show interconnections among key variables that represent dynamic feedback structure sterman 2000 2012 the generic causal loop diagram of the water management for cotton production in uzbekistan is shown in fig 2 overall the conceptual model consists of 16 system variables which are connected to each other by 20 links the interactions generate 6 feedback loops comprising three reinforcing positive and three balancing negative loops these feedback loops capture the essential components of the cotton production system that is the water resource water salination the cotton area the production and expected profitability which generate the dynamic behavior of cotton production systems in the agro ecological zones in uzbekistan causal loop diagrams identify the principal feedback loops of the systems the causal loop diagrams are used to describe basic causal mechanisms hypothesized to generate the reference mode of behavior of the system over time a feedback loop contains two or more casualty related variables that close back on themselves the relationship between one variable and next in the loop can be either positive or negative a positive relationship means that if one variable increases the other also increases for example in fig 2 the arrow from water resources to water adequacy means that an increase in water resources causes an increase in water adequacy it can also mean if water resources decreases water adequacy will also decrease the arrow starting from water resources and terminating at water adequacy with a sign at the end of the arrow means the cause effect relationship is positive in a negative relationship the two variables change inversely for example in fig 2 the arrow in the direction of water resources to water salinity means that if water resources increase water salinity will decrease it can also mean if water resources decreases water salinity will also increase the arrow starting from water resources and terminating at water salinity with a sign at the end of the arrow means the cause effect relationship is negative one can easily determine if a loop is positive or negative by counting the number of negative relationship in a loop if there are an even numbers of negative relationships in total in a feedback loop then the loop is positive if there are odd numbers of negative relationships the loop is negative in fact positive feedback loops generate growth i e the loop is reinforcing and negative feedback loops are goal seeking the feedback loop structures of a system generate the dynamics behaviors of the system and in this study three reinforcing feedback loops as well as three balancing feedback loops generate the dynamic behaviors of the water management system net cotton area increase leads to an increase in cotton area r1 and consequently water adequacy decline as the capacity of the water resource is approached the water adequacy diminishes and the fractional net area increase will also decline loop b1 the cotton area continues to grow but at a slower rate until water resources are just scarce enough to halt the growth loop b2 water consumption by the cotton area creates a second negative feedback limiting loop area growth now cuts water adequacy by two ways by reducing the water resources available per unit area and by reducing total water resources simultaneously decline in water volume leads to an increase in water salinity which in turn causes to soil degradation which acts to reduce the fractional net area increase loop b3 the negative loops gradually gain in strength at some point when the net cotton area falls to zero and the cotton area reaches its peak the rate of decline of the water resources is at its maximum the water resources continue to drop water per unit area fall further and the net cotton area increase becomes negative total revenue increases with the increase of total harvest as a result more fund is invested on drip irrigation for cotton resulting more total harvest r2 and also the investment on the drip irrigation ensures more irrigation water for cotton production which also increases the total harvest r3 2 3 quantitative model development the next step of analysis is quantifying the causal loop mechanisms into a detailed simulation model the fourth process in fig 1 the feedback loops in the previous step are the key endogenous mechanisms which generate the dynamics of cotton production system in this study and the stock and flow diagrams provide the numerical basis of a sd model bala et al 2017 forrester 1961 sterman 2000 2012 the stock and flows are represented as a collection of stocks levels accumulations and flows rates respectively so material or energy accumulates in stocks and moves between them through flows bousquet 2010 ibragimov et al 2019 stocks are expressed mathematically as integrals and the inflows and outflows are change in the level of the stock over time and are influenced by current condition of stock levels auxiliary functions which can take on any large number of potential mathematical functions and delays each connected through an information link clouds represent sources and sinks here the ventana simulation environment vensim dss together with isee systems model building and simulation tool stella program are used the detailed flow diagram of the water management for cotton production in uzbekistan is shown in fig 3 the building blocks of the model are stock and flow the mathematical equations that describe stock and flow structures are represented by integral equations in form 1 s t o c k t s t o c k t 0 t 0 t inf l o w s o u t f l o w s d s where inflow s and outflow s represent the value of inflow and outflow respectively at any time between the initial time t 0 and the current time t in stella 2 s t o c k t s t o c k t δ t inf l o w δ t o u t f l o w δ t the building blocks of the model are stock and flow the stock is a state variable and it represents the state or condition of the system at any time t the stock is represented by a rectangle the flow shows how the stock changes with time and it is represented by valve symbol the flow with arrow towards the stock indicates inflow and the flow with arrow outwards indicates outflow the lines with arrow are influence lines and the direction indicates the direction of information flow the variable factor at the starting point indicates the variable factor affecting the variable factor at the terminating point and this in essence shows how one variable factor influences other variable factor with direction of information flow in fig 3 cotton area is a stock variable and expansion rate and cotton to wheat conversion are inflow and outflow respectively into the stock cotton area fundamental equations that correspond to major state variables shown in fig 3 are as follows one of the major changes made to uzbek agricultural policy after the independence is to reconsider national food security and achieve grain wheat sufficiency the uzbek government mandated a reduction of cotton production and an increase in that of wheat abdullaev et al 2009 cotton area is increased by expansion rate and decreased by conversion of cotton area into wheat area and this relationship can be expressed as 3 cotton area integ expansion rate cotton to wheat conversion initial cotton area the expansion rate depends on desired expansion rate and expansion delay and it can be expressed as 4 expansion rate desired expansion rate expansion delay expansion delay 1 conversion of cotton area into wheat area can be expressed as 5 cotton to wheat conversion smooth if then else time 2000 0 depletion fraction 2 the water volume change over time and it is increased by inflow and decreased by outflow and the relationship is expressed as gaybullaev et al 2012 6 water resources integ inflow outflow initial water resources the inflow is computed as a summation of precipitation and river runoff 7 inflow presipitation river runoff the outflow is computed as a summation of evaporation water requirement of cotton and water requried per ha wheat area 8 outflow evaporation water requirement of cotton water required per ha wheat area water requirement is computed from cotton area and water required per ha cotton area as 9 water requirement cotton area x water required per ha cotton area the cotton receives 10 000 m 3 of water per hectare and the current area is about 35 of agricultural water use in the country abdullaev et al 2009 and it is expressed as water required per ha cotton area 10 000 relative water resource is the ratio of water resources to normal water resources and it is expressed as 10 relative water resource water resources normal water resources depletion fraction is computed from normal cotton area depletion and effect of relative water on depletion rate as 11 depletion fraction normal cotton area depletion x effect of relative water on depletion rate normal cotton area depletion is zero before time 1980 and 50000 from time 1980 and it is controlled by government regulation over cotton and it can be expressed as 12 normal cotton area depletion if then else time 1982 50000 0 x government regulation over cotton the relationship between the effect of relative water on depletion rate and relative water resources is expressed as a graphical function as shown in fig 4 the horizontal axis is relative water resources defined on a scale from zero to one the general shape is that the effect of relative water on depletion rate is unity till the relative water resources approaches 0 50 and then it has a steep downward slope as relative water resources increases the effect becomes weaker a relative water resources of 0 75 depletes the cotton area to 45 of what the area could otherwise be decreased when relative water resources is equal or greater than one then water availability is satisfied and the effect takes a value of 0 0 which means no area decline the graphical function is expressed as 13 effect of relative water on depletion rate graph relative water resource f 0 0 00 1

salinity reference salinity x effect of relative water on water salinity the water salinity level was 10 g l gaybullaev et al 2012 in the reference year and is expressed as follows reference salinity 10 the higher relative water resource the less is the water salination this relationship is shown graphically in fig 5 as relative water resource increases from zero to 0 4 the effect of relative water on water salinity decreases from 13 to 3 85 times and as relative water resource increases even further to 0 8 the effect of relative water on water salinity decreases to 1 5 times finally as the relative water resource increases to one the effect gradually approaches a numerical value of one this relationship can be expressed as 15 effect of relative water on water salinity graph relative

reperesents that the salinity effect is balanced by precipitation river runoff evaporation the effect takes a numerical 1 0 implying that it is an uninterrupted area expansion as the indicated salinity increases the effect becomes stronger an indicated salinity of 11 g l reduces the cotton area expansion to 75 of what could otherwise be expanded an indicated salinity of 20 g l is completely

discussions 3 1 data collection data used in this model were collected from interviews published litarature and government reports the initial values and parameter values are estimated from the primary and secondary data collected from these reports and interviews for model validation the values of some key parameters and variables used in the model are presented in table 1 3 2 model validation to build up confidence in the predictions of the model various ways of validating a model such as comparing the model predictions with historic data checking whether the model generates plausible behavior and checking the quality of the parameter values were considered tests for building confidence in the model were conducted to demonstrate the potentiality of the model tests for building confidence in the system dynamics models essentially consist of validation sensitivity analysis and policy analysis bala et al 2017 two important notions of the building confidence in the system dynamics models are testing and validation of the system dynamics models testing means the comparison of a model to empirical reality for accepting or rejecting the model and validation means the process of establishing confidence in the soundness and usefulness of the model in the behavioral validity tests emphasis should be on the behavioral patterns rather than an point prediction barlas 1996 researchers grant et al 1997 vanclay and skovsgaard 1997 have advocated the terminology model evaluation instead of model validation the term emphasizes relative utility of a model a model that is useful for one purpose may be misleading for other purposes fig 7 shows the comparison of simulated cotton area of uzbekistan from 1960 to 2017 with the observed data also fig 8 shows the comparison of the simulated total cotton with reported values the basic patterns and data of the simulated behavior adequately agree with the observed pattern and data also the model generates plausible behavior thus the model can predict the dynamic behavior of the water management system for cotton production in uzbekistan the validated model was used as a baseline scenario for policy analysis table 2 provides further evidence of the simulated behavior in this table the summary statistics for the cotton area and total cotton production are listed and the theil 1 1 the theil statistics show the overall error and it is decomposed into um us and uc fraction of error into bias unequal variation and unequal covariance respectively j sterman 2000 j d sterman 2000 inequality statistics is decomposed as suggested by sterman 2000 2012 regarding fig 7 not only is the root mean square percent error rmspe remarkably low with 7 deviation to the historical value but also almost 60 of this error is due to unsystematic error uc implying that trend mean and variance are similar in both historical and simulated data and most of the error stemmed from unequal covariation athe rmspe standardized measure of the magnitude of the error the rmspe for total cotton area was 8 the majority of the error was due to unequal covariation 88 and the error attributable to unequal variation was 11 the unequal variation component of the error was 1 this result indicates that the model captures the mean value and main changes in the historical data precisely as depicted in fig 8 a better fit was prohibited by the high sensitivity to the state level policy shift of cotton mandate though the authors found the reproduced outcomes sufficiently good to support the dynamic hypothesis of the cotton production system we conducted multivariate sensitivity analysis to test the robustness of the simulation outcomes to assumptions over the range of uncertainty fig 9 shows the results of multivariate sensitivity analysis of the cotton production model the figure shows the 50 75 95 and 100 confidence bounds for total cotton production in a sample of 200 simulations salinity water required per ha cotton area normal expansion river runoff precipitation and evaporation are all distributed independently with deviations of about 30 of their base values there is a 95 chance that total cotton production will be between about 1 7 and 5 6 million t y in year 2004 and 100 chance that total cotton production will be between 2 3 and 3 8 million t y 3 3 scenarios for policy analysis in this study four policy options are considered to assess the management strategies and explore their impacts on cotton production farmers profitability and conservation of water resources besides baseline four policy scenarios were developed to assess their impacts on water demands crop production and net farm income the description of policy options and scenarios are summarized in table 3 and these are as follows 3 3 1 policy option 1 s1 the investment in drip irrigation which is based on the presidential decree no 5742 of 06 17 2019 for the efficient use of land and water resources in agriculture 3 3 2 policy option 2 s2 removal of price controls which implies that the cotton farm gate prices to be at levels that guarantee positive returns to farmers even though interventions to achieve such objectives are complex and involve multi stakeholder decision making 3 3 3 policy option 3 s3 crop productivity is increased through r d and cotton productivity growth is necessary for maintaining farmer incomes and improving the international competitiveness of domestic cotton based industries moreover with increasing pressure on the water resources long term sustainability in cotton production and the ongoing competitiveness of the cotton sector will depend mostly on increases in crop productivity per unit of area 3 3 4 policy option 4 policy mix s1 s2 s3 policy mix is a policy option of the combination of the policy s1 s2 and s3 the simulation results of above policy scenarios for 31 years starting from 2019 are discussed here 3 3 5 simulated scenarios of the water requirements under different policy options fig 10 shows simulates scenarios of the water requirements of cotton under different policy options the water requirement of cotton shows a sharp decline over the past three decades it shows a decline in water requirement from 20 km 3 y in 1991 12 km 3 y in 2003 and then it flattens out onwards until 2019 for all the policy options water requirement of cotton is then moderately reduced from12 km 3 y in 2019 to about 7 km 3 y in 2003 for the policy options s1 and policy mix while it remains unchanged for the policy options s2 and s3 reduced water requirement of cotton is due to the adoption of water saving technology such as drip irrigation drip irrigation based on a micro irrigation system has the capability to save water and minerals permitting inflow of water at the roots of crops thus it is expected that the total water requirement of the cotton is reduced to about 4 9 km 3 y at the end of the simulation period the system is therefore advantageous not only in terms of the saving of water resources but also due to the recovery of land soil energy labor fuel and mineral fertilizer savings and decreased greenhouse gas emissions 3 3 6 simulated scenarios of the total cotton production under different policy options fig 11 portrays the simulation outcomes for total cotton production scenarios for the baseline s1 s2 s3 and policy mix for a simulation period of 31 years the cotton production declined exponentially from slightly above 5 million t y in 1991 to about 3 million t y in 2005 for the baseline and policy option s2 for a simulation period of a 31 years it increases from 3 million t y in 2019 3 47 million t y for policy option s3 in 2020 which is about 15 6 higher than 3 million t y under the scenarios baseline and s2 policy option s1 shows slightly better result with an increase of cotton production to 3 93 million t y in 2020 which is 31 and 13 2 higher than 3 million t y and 3 47 million t y for the baseline and policy option s3 respectively these results again suggest that investment in drip irrigation is a rational decision although the cotton production performs well for the policy option s1 it even grows at a much higher rate under the policy mix scenario in comparison to all the policy options thus this policy option is favorable due to investment in drip irrigation and increasing yield through r d resulting in much higher cotton production the policy options s2 alone does not contribute to the total cotton production after 2005 the earlier maturing of cotton has been experienced when drip irrigation is implemented 3 3 7 simulated scenarios of the profitability under different policy options fig 12 shows the simulated cotton profitability scenarios under the four policy options for a simulation period of a 31 years the sharp decline in profitability scenarios for policy options s1 and s1 s2 s3 in 2020 due to high investment in drip irrigation system niyazmetov and rudenko 2013 reported that the investment for the installation of the drip irrigation system was 88 4 million soums per 10 ha the effect of price control withdrawal s2 compensates the effect of productivity improvement s3 in terms of profitability the cotton export in the country is strictly monitored this regulation inhibits world cotton price transmission and induce raw materials to be transferred from suppliers by the government or semi governmental firms macdonald 2012 and cotton prices were fixed as a percentage of world cotton prices varying between 70 and 85 sadler 2006 the cotton price under scenario s2 is increased to the same level of current world cotton price while the cotton productivity per ha is changed exogenously to the maximum economic potential level the policy option s1 is the worst policy and the positive profitability starts in 2039 and the policy mix s1 s2 s3 is the most efficient policy option the profitability of policy options s2 and s3 are similar but the policy s2 is slightly better than policy s3 the investment in drip irrigation s1 price control withdrawal s2 and productivity increase s3 is not efficient when considered in isolation 4 policy implications the cotton production in uzbekistan needs development strategies to improve water use efficiency production and profitability in the long term our simulation results support the following policy implications the drip irrigation system has higher positive impacts not only in terms of cost reduction but also through savings of water resources increased productivity and decreased greenhouse gas emissions and hence investment for drip irrigation needs priority attention for sustainability in the long run perspective our findings also suggest that the price paid by the government to farmers should be market based with the purpose of providing full incentives including higher positive net return attributable to the excessive level of cotton water consumption more investment for research to develop a new breed of cotton of much more productivity needs priority attention training and extension services should be fostered to enhance the productivity at farm levels through a participatory way of learning by doing of the farmers field schools and it is essential for dissemination of cutting edge technologies diversification should be practiced with more priority on less water consuming highly profitable and environmentally friendly cropping structure finally the favorable policy of the sustainable cotton production entails cotton farm gate price to be based on world cotton price investment in drip irrigation and r d simultaneously 5 conclusions cotton is the main crop in uzbekistan declining of cotton area and tremendous pressure on water resources for cotton irrigation are major concerns for policy makers the overshoot and collapse of cotton production is one of the outcomes of the short term profit at the cost of reducing the societal and ecological well being thereby increasing salinity level reduction in net return with the demolition of several economic activities reliant on water habitats for vegetation and wild life this study is designed to assess policy issues such as investment on drip irrigation cotton price liberalization productivity improvement and a policy mix which is a combination of these policies the mix policy is the most efficient policy among the policy issues investment on drip irrigation along with liberalization of cotton price and improvement in crop productivity is needed for policy implementation the drip irrigation policy proposed helps save significant amount of water consumption which can be accomplished by controlled frequency of water flow and quantity in line with the requirements of crops with no water loss and evaporation based on the simulation results it is apparent that farm supports are essential to help farmers adopt water saving technologies to maintain their income and biodiversity to promote the farmers to adopt water saving technologies initial financial aid is needed in terms of minimizing the cost of equipment to improve the crop productivity research and development programs for high yielding and hybrid cotton should be strengthened this model can be extended further to include the transfer of the high mountainous areas of water scarcity into the areas of fruits and vegetables production and the transfer of high saline areas into fisheries areas along with investments on modernization of cotton production using machine picking and modern ginning this study is recommended for further research and the model developed can be used as a computer laboratory with certain modifications of the existing model declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
9586,water scarcity and soil salinization in arid regions have made desalination a competitive alternative source for irrigation perceptions of a higher cost and other misconceptions about desalinated water have limited its broader usage in agriculture in this study we have focused on understanding the suitability of using desalinated water as a substitute for saline water in the pecan carya illinoinensis orchards of southwest texas pecan is a perennial high value nut crop that cannot be easily replaced therefore it represents a perfect case study for the application of desalinated water a recently developed system dynamic model smituv system dynamic modeling of infiltration solute transport and root water uptake in vadose zone was modified to assess the effects of irrigation with desalinated water when soil water salt content increased above pecan tolerance levels this model simulated five irrigation scenarios with different fractions of river water and saline groundwater as expected to sustain the same level of pecan production a higher amount of desalinated water was needed with increasing amounts of groundwater in the irrigation mix soil texture had a significant influence on the amount of desalinated water required for sandy and silty soils the 100 river water scenario required no additional desalinated water clayey soils could not sustain high production even in a 100 river water scenario an economic analysis showed that pecan operations might be viable in non clayey regions for some irrigation mixture even after factoring in the cost of using desalinated water however current desalination techniques and associated costs were economically unviable for sustaining pecan in regions with saline groundwater and clayey soils this study also demonstrated the application of smituv and system dynamic modeling as a decision making tool to assist growers in understanding the farm scale applicability of desalinated water keywords irrigation

saturated water content qr residual water content ph ph of the soil z soil layer depth 1 introduction water availability for irrigation and soil salinity are existential risk factors for production agriculture in arid and semi arid regions of the world river water availability constrained by low precipitation and drought conditions has forced the use of other alternative water resources such as saline groundwater for irrigation similar trends are seen in the rio grande region basin near el paso texas where river water supplies are rapidly declining and marginal quality groundwater with higher total dissolved solids tds is often used to fill the deficit in irrigation water application of such water marginal quality waters has been known to cause soil salinization ayers and westcot 1985 these complex relations between water and salt often mean that arid region agriculture is under both water and salinity stress increasing soil salinity through irrigation water can cause crop system deterioration by reducing the plant root water uptake due to increased osmotic stress this can severely impair photosynthesis and other metabolic processes leading to lower crop yields bernstein 1975 skaggs et al 2006 russo et al 2009 shrivastava and kumar 2015 in such cases the conventional method of reclaiming salt affected soils is to leach salts below the crop root zone van schilfgaarde et al 1974 facilitated by irrigating with excess water than what is required by the crop to meet evapotranspiration needs irrigation water electrical conductivity ec also plays an important role in facilitating appropriate leaching simulations and field experiments conducted by shani and dudley 2001 and ben gal et al 2008 demonstrated that ordinary irrigation water with an ec value of 1 2 ds m 1 demands a higher amount of irrigation by a factor of 1 5 2 than the potential transpiration demand of a plant it is usual to assume a model where the response of crop root water uptake to the increased salinity remains unaffected until a threshold value reaches above which the crop yield reduces rapidly with a small portion of salinity rise miyamoto et al 1986 van genuchten 1987 skaggs et al 2006 russo et al 2009 miyamoto and nesbitt 2011 ganjegunte and clark 2019 some crops are salt tolerant which means those crops have the ability to withstand higher salinity without hampering their normal growth and yield often with increasing salinity the effective soil volume for the water uptake by plant roots is significantly diminished this also has implications for nutrient fertilizer uptake seasonal displacement of salts to the deeper soil occurs during the precipitation period however these salts can move towards the soil surface and develop an inverted salinity profile with deficit irrigation these seasonal dynamics of salt movement within the profile make the soil salinity prediction complicated climate farm management and crop characteristics are also important for assessing salinity impacts climatic factors like temperature and humidity that govern evapotranspiration affect crop salt tolerance capability for instance lower evapotranspiration demands generally correlate to higher tolerance to bulk soil salinity pre plantation irrigation can help in increasing the salt tolerance of crops at later growth stages minhas et al 2020 reviewed the salt tolerance capability of common crops that can be used as general guidelines to deal with the salinity for irrigated agriculture salt tolerance of a crop is defined in relative terms rather than absolute terms the soil salinity measured as ec is accepted as a representative and comparable measure of salinity in the crop root zone maas and hoffman 1977 irrigation water with ec less than 0 7 ds m 1 is considered to be harmless to soils and crops water having an ec value ranging from 0 7 to 3 0 ds m 1 is slightly to moderately harmful and may require additional water to leach salts out of the root zone ayers and westcot 1985 salt leaching is difficult in clayey soils compared to sandy soils because of the texture and hydraulic conductivity clayey soils contain fine texture particles and have very low permeability while sandy soils contain coarse texture particles and are more permeable for water thus the salinity accumulation also varies with different soil texture classes saline soils can often be sodic because of naturally occurring sodium elements that can cause crusting and sealing of soils it can limit the leaching process by lowering water infiltration caused by soil dispersion into the subsurface soils thus soil sodicity is also important to take into account for the salt leaching process salinity distribution is neither uniform with soil depth nor constant with time under field conditions usually it depends on water availability by precipitation and irrigation antecedent soil conditions and leaching practices different models such as the steady state model

1996 suarez and šimůnek 1997 were developed and used comprehensively to investigate such complicated salinity dynamics and its relationship with crop growth and yield these models are helpful in providing an adaptable research solution for agriculture sustainability these models differ in the salt water processes simulated and are often difficult to integrate with new components and modify existing components as an alternative a system dynamic model can provide a graphical modeling environment that allows the user to better understand and easily modify the system connections such as soil water crop salt system interactions the system dynamic approach has the capability to model a complex nonlinear dynamic relationship that changes over time it has a graphical modeling structure and uses graphical e g stocks flows converters connectors internal feedback loops and programmatic elements e g functions and equations to simulate the system under observation saysel and barlas 2001 sterman 2000 recently a system dynamics model smituv was developed by poulose et al 2021 that provides an alternative and interactive model to study dynamics of salt transport soil water flow and root water uptake in a multi layered unsaturated soil desalination particularly with solar energy has often been presented as an alternative approach to reduces salts in the marginal water for agriculture subramani and jacangelo 2015 shahzad et al 2017 reca et al 2018 delgado et al 2020 khan et al 2021 the desalination process performed by the reverse osmosis and other techniques have advanced significantly in the last few decades the cost of such desalinated water production also has dropped dramatically tal 2006 elimelech and phillip 2011 aminfard et al 2019 desalinated water could become an alternative source of water to augment irrigation needs for high value crops especially during periods of drought when river water availability for agricultural irrigation is at its lowest optimal crop yields and reduced water requirements for leaching salts below the crop root zone are potential benefits of irrigation with more desalinated water ben gal et al 2009 russo et al 2009 theoretically it is clear that with proper soil management desalinated water can be used for salinity management and maintaining the crop root water uptake capacity this study aims to use a modified smituv model to understand the applicability of desalination in the arid region where the rising salinity problem is affecting crop production the main objective of this study was to investigate the effect of different water mixes groundwater river water and desalinated water on soil salinity dynamics and root water uptake it includes the direct use of groundwater and or river water conventional method and the use of desalinated water alternative method salinization of soils in the arid region continues to be an existential problem often worsened by conventional irrigation practices the problem is particularly severe for perennial orchards grown in the arid region e g pecans however irrigation strategies using desalinated water which can lower salt inputs into the soil have not gained much traction and are not applied yet there is a knowledge gap on the viability of desalination for regional agriculture to fill this research gap the study focused on exploring an alternative irrigation strategy that can sustain commercially viable yield and maximize net profit from pecan production for this purpose the smituv model poulose et al 2021 was modified in the isee stella architect software environment this modeling environment allows for modification in the system connections with relative ease the smituv model was developed by poulose et al 2021 to simulate changes in agroecosystems under the water and salinity stresses the study focuses on el paso county the arid region of southwest texas where cotton and pecan are the main crops grown under water and salinity stress conditions ganjegunte and clark 2019 cotton is an annual highly salt tolerant crop while pecan is a perennial moderately salt tolerant crop often to sustain pecan growth in dry seasons and during drought periods when the river water supply is inadequate farmers pump saline groundwater to make up the deficit however direct use of highly saline groundwater results in the accumulation of salts in the soil profile cox et al 2018 elevated salinity levels lead to a less effective soil volume in the root zone and negatively impact pecan root water uptake and plant development miyamoto et al 1995 ganjegunte et al 2017 the soils in this region vary from fine texture clayey soils to coarse texture sandy soils with such different soil textures subsurface agricultural system processes also vary this study simulated the responses of flood irrigated pecan orchards with different soil types to the application of desalinated water further to assess the viability of such intervention the costs of desalinated water production and application were also investigated for hypothetical pecan orchards in different soil textures 2 materials and methods 2 1 system dynamic model smituv the system dynamic model smituv was developed to simulate the effects of salinity and water stress on root water uptake in the unsaturated zone of flood irrigated land poulose et al 2021 the smituv model was formulated using the stock flow converter based approach and runs on a daily time step poulose et al 2021 developed the smituv model and cross verified the numerical methods by comparing simulation results with the similarly calibrated hydrus outputs the graphical user interface of this model is easy to interpret and visualize the system connections within five feedback loops this dynamically relates different systems to each other through reinforcing and counteracting loops the model structure has three soil layers of depth 30 cm 30 cm and 40 cm and four sectors soil water flow root water uptake solute transport and hydraulic reduction discussed in detail later several physically based and empirical relationships were used to simulate the soil water crop salt systems in the smituv the richards equation was used to model the one dimensional water flow in an unsaturated incompressible soil porous media parissopoulos and wheater 1990 the modified richards equation is formulated as 1 θ t z k dh dz 1 s where θ is the water content in cm3 cm 3 t is the time in days z is the depth of soil layer in cm h is the capillary water suction head in cm and s is the sink term representing the plant root water uptake in cm3 cm 3 day 1 conventional richards equation is solved using a finite difference method to transform it to a discretized form kroes et al 2009 a sink term in the discretized richards equation was used to simulate the root water uptake from each soil layer feddes and zaradny 1978 and modified to introduce osmotic stress van genuchten 1987 the root water uptake capacity depends on the water stress osmotic stress root characteristics and evapotranspiration reduction in the root water uptake is subjected to water stress due to rise in the water pressure head salinity stress due to accumulated salts buildup in the crop root zone and the osmotic potential the equation used to calculate the root water uptake rate s is expressed as 2 s β α h α s t p where β is the normalized root distribution function α h is the soil water stress response function α s is the salinity stress response function and t p is the potential evapotranspiration hydraulic properties of the unsaturated soil were calculated using a set of closed form equations of van genuchten 1980 and capillary model using the equations of mualem 1976 which incorporates soil chemical properties such as sodicity and ph suarez and šimůnek 1997 the advection diffusion equation was used to model the non reactive and non interactive solute transport in the subsurface soil under transient water flow conditions freeze and cherry 1979 van dam 2000 3 θ c t q c z z θ d diff dc dz where c is the total solute concentration per unit volume of soil in g cm3 q is the volumetric flux given by darcy s equation and d diff is the diffusion constant in cm2 per day the hydraulic reduction is a normalized function that indicates a decrease in the effective hydraulic conductivity of soil due to the presence of exchangeable sodium which can result in clay dispersion and swelling of the soil and adverse ph šimůnek et al 1996 suarez and šimůnek 1997 this function is expressed as 4 r r 1 r 2 where r 1 is the normalized function for exchangeable sodium and r 2 is adverse soil ph 2 2 model input parameters the model setup requires a time variable and initial boundary conditions soil hydraulic properties crop data such as root distribution salt tolerance threshold value and evapotranspiration daily precipitation data were obtained from the climate data online cdo national climatic data center ncdc for ten years note that the climatic conditions e g temperature precipitation etc were set to simulate a decade period from 1947 to 1956 which was the driest period in history using the climate for the driest observed period in the recent past represents a worst case water availability scenario grounded in observation the pecan crop is typically irrigated from may to october local growers apply on average 127 mm irrigation depth during the growing season with additional irrigation of 50 mm in march fig 1 the march irrigation is done to leach out the initial excess salts from the soil and for land preparation before the onset of the irrigation season this practice helps push the salts in the root zone deeper and increase pecan root water uptake after first irrigation in may total irrigation water is calculated as the sum of groundwater and river water along with incident rainfall daily salt loads were estimated by the weighted average of salts present in different water sources in el paso county table 1 the effective root water uptake of pecan is based on root distribution beneath the soil full grown pecan roots in soil reach a span of 300 cm on either side and 80 cm in depth miyamoto 1982 fig 2 soil information is obtained for the el paso region of texas from the web soil survey input data rainfall root growth evapotranspiration hydraulic conductivity calcium magnesium and sodium similar to that used by poulose et al 2021 has been utilized in this study other soil inputs the air entry pressure alpha cm 1 and pore size distribution n of the soil water retention curve were adopted from the experiments of schaap and van genuchten 2006 for three soil groups given in table 2 consumptive water use was estimated using monthly potential evapotranspiration obtained from the texas et network and crop coefficient for pecan miyamoto 1982 2 3 modifications in the model the smituv model was modified by adding a water input function a salt input function sectors for the desalination process and a sector for cost estimation in addition osmotic stress response functions were also changed in the original model to trigger irrigation with desalinated water figs 3 and 4 the irrigation water sources explored are groundwater river water and a mixture of both table 1 variation in the salt concentration due to different water sources for irrigation could impact salt inputs and thus the crop root water uptake rate which eventually affects the crop yield skaggs et al 2006 in the model if the soil water ec reaches a critical value for pecan irrigation by desalinated water is triggered until the average soil water ec drops below the ec critical value the ec critical value was set to a threshold according to soil groups the ec critical value of 2 5 ds m was set for sandy soil 1 8 ds m for silty soil and 1 1 ds m for clayey soil based on the experiments conducted by miyamoto et al 1986 and miyamoto and nesbitt 2011 for an arid region pecan orchard the ec critical value is the maximum salinity limit ecmax of the system for pecan survival ec values beyond ec critical value will substantially limit the plant growth and yield if the ec in the soil water is below its critical value it is assumed that the root water uptake is not affected thus the pecan yield remains the same the ec ec critical and ecmax values used in this study are different and set in the model for different purposes the ec value is set for soil water system salt concentration i e salinity in the field the ecmax value is set for the maximum salinity of the soil water system the ec critical value is set as the threshold maximum ec value beyond which pecan growth reduces substantially another module was added to this model to assess the costs of desalination for various scenarios the purpose and their mathematical expressions used for the model development are given in table 3 2 3 1 water input function the water input function is added in the soil water flow sector with the condition that if the salt concentration in the pecan root zone goes beyond the ec critical value then desalinated water will be used for irrigation by the model in all other cases regular irrigation from a mixture of groundwater and river water is applied discussed in section 2 4 this is done to simulate operations where the grower will start using desalinated water once the expected soil water ec is higher than the critical ec and then switch back to regular irrigation once ec values are below the critical value 2 3 2 salt input function the salt input function is added in the salt transport sector to mirror the water input function thus if salt concentration solute in the root zone goes beyond the ec critical value then the salt concentration of the desalinated water 0 0001 g cm3 will be used otherwise the salt concentration total dissolved salts solids tds of the irrigation water mixture will be used 2 3 3 osmotic stress response function we have also modified the smituv model to add crop senescence as a result of salinity induced osmotic stress the osmotic stress function in the root water uptake sector includes the ecmax value representing a level above which the crop dies the conditional expression used to represent senescence is similar to that used before for salt and water input functions once ec in soil water exceeds ecmax water uptake by crop roots is drastically reduced due to salinity stress this function helps maintain the salinity stress in the crop until a threshold ec critical value beyond which the plant will die and not recover even if the ec values improve 2 3 4 two new sectors for desalination process and cost estimation we have added two new sectors in the smituv model fig 4 1 to estimate the total desalinated water used for irrigation and concentrate water reject produced after the desalination process and 2 to estimate the costs of the desalinated water table 3 rejected water is considered 30 of the total raw water used for the desalination process based on literature estimates ahmed et al 2003 mohamed et al 2005 this may vary and depends on the processing unit the total cost of desalinated water used for irrigation is calculated with respect to the minimum and maximum cost of the thousand gallons 3785 41 liters of desalinated water produced given by the texas water development board arroyo and shirazi 2012 2 4 irrigation water scenarios depending on the annual water availability in the rio grande river local pecan growers in the region use a different mix of river water and saline groundwater for irrigation groundwater is used as an alternate water source for pecan irrigation when river water availability and accessibility are not enough to meet crop needs river water availability of course varies with changes in precipitation distribution over this arid region as well as regulated streamflows from the upstream caballo reservoir and elephant butte reservoir in that case water mixing is the only option for irrigation to simulate the scenarios often observed in this arid region five different fractions of river water and saline groundwater were considered table 4 all these scenarios were simulated individually for the pecan using the modified smituv model it is impractical to obtain a commercial crop yield without adding the requisite amount of macro and micro nutrients to the desalinated water for irrigation yermiyahu et al 2007 hence it was assumed that the desalinated water has a 100 mg l salt concentration which can be achieved by combining desalination water with some raw water or the desalination reject we assumed that simulations based on such a water mixture can provide optimal desalinated water use for sustainable agriculture and maximum economic output for local growers these simulations are also helpful to assess the impact of possible alternative irrigation practices on the pecan among the irrigation water scenarios ws1 is entirely based on groundwater source with high salt concentration input from the water most likely in dry years 2021 was estimated to be close to this scenario in comparison ws5 is based on the availability of enough river water to account for all irrigation needs the smituv model is simulated for scenarios ws1 to ws5 table 4 and three soil groups table 2 to compare irrigation practices in the arid region pecan orchard 2 5 cost estimation only the variable costs were allowed to vary among simulations in this study fixed costs that do not depend on desalinated water use were kept constant examples of fixed costs are labor administrative equipment and membrane replacement costs and property fees or taxes as applicable depending on locality the total cost of desalinated water for irrigation relies on a function of the production cost ranges from 0 29 to 0 63 per cubic meter of water given by the texas water development board arroyo and shirazi 2012 and the total volume of desalinated water used v dw for irrigating one hectare pecan field the total cost of desalinated water for irrigation practice is calculated as 5 desalinated water cos t min 0 29 v dw 6 desalinated water cos t max 0 63 v dw 7 net benefit cost pecan market cost average pecan production fixed cost desalinated water cost 8 break even market price fixed cost desali nated water cost average pecan production 3 results 3 1 effect of different water scenarios five irrigation water combinations were simulated to study the impact on the salt concentration solute and water movement root water uptake and salinity stress response for three soil texture groups these results should help compare irrigation practices with desalinated water for pecan growers in the arid region 3 1 1 salt concentration the simulations for pecan show varying cumulative salt concentrations under different water scenarios fig 5 as expected the ws1 simulation with 100 marginal groundwater results in high salt accumulation in the soil while the ws5 simulation with 100 surface water results in low salt accumulation regardless of soil texture class all simulations started with negligible salts content in the soil nevertheless the salt buildup to the critical value happened in one year for ws1 scenario under all three soil types by the end of the second year all irrigation scenarios except ws5 had reached the critical value the results demonstrate that salt concentration decreases in the active root zone as the water scenario changes from groundwater irrigation ws1 to river water irrigation ws5 as constrained by the model by the use of desalinated water once the salt concentration reaches a threshold value ec critical assigned for each soil type it does not increase beyond that level this result shows that the pecan growth can sustain in sandy and silty soils without the use of desalinated water in the ws5 100 river water scenario however in clayey soil a small amount of desalinated water is needed even when irrigating with 100 river water to lower salt accumulation in the root zone and maintain full productivity the result also suggests that for irrigation scenarios except for ws5 there will be some yield reduction at different times in the growing season due to salinity without the use of desalinated water 3 1 2 salinity stress response function hs the results for the salinity stress response function hs show the effect of different irrigation scenarios is limited between 0 85 and 1 fig 6 salinity stress with irrigation from ws1 to ws5 decreases in the root zone and water movement increases across pecan plants cell membranes the prolonged salinity stress in the root zone could lower the water potential in plant cells cause critical cell damage and impact plant development miyamoto et al 1986 shani and dudley 2001 skaggs et al 2006 parihar et al 2015 shrivastava and kumar 2015 as expected the irrigation scenario ws5 produces low salinity stress however the salinity stress for irrigation scenarios ws2 to ws5 ranges from 0 85 to 1 and is controlled by irrigation with desalinated water 3 1 3 pecan root water uptake the effect of different irrigation practices on the pecan root water uptake illustrates no major changes fig 7 it is because of the newly added water function with the condition that if the ecmax reaches a threshold value then use desalinated water this condition prevents salinity stress and maintains the same root water uptake during the simulation period as relative root water uptake can be considered and used in the model as a good proxy for relative crop yield skaggs et al 2006 desalinated water in irrigation helps in consistent pecan growth and production over time however a small difference is observed for total root water uptake between the three soil groups in the clayey soil pecan root uptake is higher by 100 200 cm in 10 years this can be attributed to the higher residual water capacity of clayey soil than sandy and silty soils 3 2 economic evaluation the simulated irrigation practice with desalinated water can help to sustain the pecan yield by minimizing salt concentration in the root zone maximizing root water uptake and minimizing salinity stress on the plants the cost of desalinated water used for irrigation is based on the production cost per cubic meter of water given by the texas water development board the results from this analysis will help us understand the economic feasibility of using desalination water to augment traditional irrigation practice for pecan orchards as the total water requirement varies for different soil texture types the total cost of desalinated water would also vary following different water scenarios and between three soil texture groups fig 8 more desalinated water is required for irrigation in clayey soil to reduce the adverse salinity effect the cost of desalinated water is always higher for clayey soil compared to sandy and silty soils there is no need to use desalinated water when irrigating with 100 river water ws5 hence no additional cost is required for pecan orchards in the sandy and silty soils these results showed that irrigation with desalinated water is desirable when groundwater use increases in fine textured soils this analysis would be beneficial in decision making and evaluating economic feasibility for local growers who may be considering using desalinated water as an optional irrigation source 4 discussion as expected the results show that irrigation with desalinated water can substantially reduce the soil salinity problem associated with the irrigation in pecan orchards in the arid southwest the use of desalinated water appears to be beneficial when the available irrigation water mixture increases salinity stress in the root zone this study shows a significant and consistent effect of irrigation practice with desalinated water shown in figs 5 to 7 this result affirms that desalinated water can help sustain pecan growth and maintain a commercially viable yield jones 2007 othman et al 2014 the ws1 scenario is likely an extreme scenario that accumulates more salts in the pecan root zone than other scenarios thus requiring more desalinated water if irrigation continued with groundwater pecan orchards could suffer irreversible adverse effects of salinity excess accumulation of salts increases the osmotic potential and thus makes less water available for plants this is more critical when soil becomes non permeable non productive and unsuitable for pecan growth also as salts continue to accumulate in soils pecan photosynthetic capability lowers tree trunk size decreases and seedling growth reduces which finally reduces nut yields and deteriorates nut quality under severe salinity stress dieback of tree branches was also observed miyamoto et al 1986 the ws5 scenario is likely an optimistic scenario which is also very unlikely given the past hydrological conditions and the prevalence of droughts in this region and headwaters of the region s reservoirs ws5 accumulates less salts in the pecan root zone thus less or no desalinated water is needed depending on the soil type to sustain the pecan growth the salt concentration analysis showed a significant change in the salinity stress if desalinated water is used for irrigation it seems that removing the salt excess before it reaches the pecan field by means of desalinated water i e the proposed irrigation management may lead to reduced agricultural soil salinity thus irrigation management using desalinated water provides a unique opportunity for sustainable pecan yield and profitable income for local growers while reducing salt accumulation over time sustaining crop yield and reducing soil salinity contributes to meeting the united nations un global sustainable development goals sdgs for agricultural food production in the future shahzad et al 2017 alawneh et al 2019 the sdgs 12 responsible consumption and production 13 climate action and 15 life on land are being addressed from this study the sdg 12 addresses the sustainable consumption and production patterns that ensure the decoupling of socio economic growth and human well being taking into account the resource use and environmental impact the sdg 13 expresses the urgent and meaningful mitigation actions to combat climate change and minimize its disruptions the sdg 15 promotes sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems and their services in line with preventing desertification restoring degraded land and soil and striving to achieve productive land desalinated water use supports these sdgs particularly for arid region agriculture it may be noted that irrigation with desalinated water also needs an efficient water distribution system lower irrigation efficiency tends to use a higher amount of desalinated water and at a higher cost reca et al 2018 an indirect benefit of the low salt content in desalinated water is the cleaning of the irrigation systems although the cost of desalinated water for irrigation is higher than the cost of groundwater and river water the benefits of sustainable crop production may lead to a net profit in some scenarios further modest environmental benefits may also be expected we expect the cost of desalination to fall with wider adoption and technological improvements if the cost of desalinated water decreases then net profit can increase for some scenarios the cost of desalination is relatively low when compared to the total pecan production cost however the capital cost to set up desalination infrastructure will be high and likely similar for all soil irrigation types although not the focus of this study these costs may be addressed by incentives already in place for water conservation from usda and other agencies according to the texas a m agrilife research by nesbitt et al 2013 a pecan orchard incurs a production cost of about 1532 per hectare per year and produces about 1121 2242 kg per hectare per year in 2020 the market price for in shell pecan was about 3 08 per kg according to usda nass 2021 with the simulated irrigation practice an average of 1681 kg of nut production can be achieved the total value of production per hectare could be 5189 and the net benefit per hectare could be 3657 however considering the desalination cost the net benefits from a one hectare pecan orchard could be somewhat lower but sustainable in sandy and silty soils compared to clayey soil table 5 the decision is complicated as other salts and heat tolerant crops e g sorghum may become economically competitive with pecan when profit margins are low however pecan farming is a long term investment and not easy to replace or transition to other crops there is significant infrastructure and knowledge investment also involved which are not easy to replace in the short term thus in the short term desalination may be a good solution for pecan growers that foresee using marginal quality groundwater in some years rejected water stream called the concentrate with a high salt concentration is also produced during desalination that may be a cause of concern particularly in landlocked regions far from sea ocean in our study we considered 30 of rejected water produced from the desalination process fig 9 which may typically vary as much as 20 50 of the feed water volume depending on the quality of raw water because of high salt content disposal of the concentrate is also important for minimizing environmental damages if more quantity of desalinated water is required for irrigation then a proportionally higher volume of rejected water will be produced according to rejection percent there are a few ways that can be used to dispose of the rejected water the evaporation technique can help to reduce the water content of the rejected concentrate and leave the salts behind other methods of commercial salt extraction from desalination rejects may also be explored ahmed et al 2003 alberti et al 2009 el naas 2011 these commercial salt extractions may be able to derive some value from the concentrate water the disposal injection well is another option to treat the rejected water giwa et al 2017 panagopoulos et al 2019 it is generally more economical to inject rejected water into disposal wells than to recycle or evaporate maliva et al 2011 panagopoulos et al 2019 other creative methods that use this water to grow extremely salt tolerant crops and algae in marginal lands jaradat 2005 kashyap et al 2020 may also be explored unique to the study area the river rio grande is lost dry downstream of hudspeth county these areas where the river seldom flows areas are typically high in salt and may be used as beds to try creative salt mitigation strategies eventually the disposed of concentrate in these areas can be discharged back to the river during floods and carried to the gulf of mexico as tds increases in irrigation water more desalinated water is required for sustaining pecan growth and the volume of rejected water could also rise concomitantly however the amount of desalinated water and rejected water varies for different soil groups fig 9 the 100 river water scenario does not use desalinated water in sandy and silty soils hence rejected water will not be an issue in this case but the rejected water could be a major problem in the case of clayey soil as a high amount of desalinated water is required for different water scenarios desalinated water requirement varies affecting the cost of desalination and disposal of rejected water the dynamics between cost rejected water and tds of both soil and water needs to be explored further for sustainable management in arid region agriculture another issue not simulated by the study is the preferential concentration of sodium ions in the produced water by reverse osmosis reverse osmosis membranes reject sodium salts at a lower rate than other salts this can cause some issues with soil sodicity however membranes may be designed and other methods of desalination may be used that can control this operational issue this study looked at one crop of the arid region under the salinity stress condition another management option to sustain agriculture and maintain food security in the region as water becomes more saline is to grow alternative crops that are more salt tolerant and less water intensive with pecan a perennial crop that takes about 5 6 years depending on pecan variety to mature and can produce for over 50 years such rapid transition can be difficult also in exceptional times one may try not to maximize the yield but just aim for tree survival the interplay between market conditions climatic conditions water availability and the outlook of all three will dictate such optimization this study did not look at such behavior but will be of paramount importance to the region modeling scale is a fundamental question in this study we set out to aid farmers and evaluate the sustainability of desalination as an answer to arid region agriculture however we can potentially use some of the results and extend them to the region there are economies of scale and optimization combining farms co locating regional desalination staggered irrigation etc potential that can be explored we will try to investigate this in a future study to extend the applicability of this study approach from farm level to regional level we need to use regional level data as inputs to the model that we considered in this study hence changes in data inputs can make the model scalable from field level to regional level 5 conclusions the system dynamic model smituv was modified and utilized for irrigation simulation and economic evaluation of the arid region pecan orchard where saline groundwater is primarily used to augment reduced river water supplies the use of a system dynamic approach to address the salinity issue is a novelty in agriculture research and promotes understanding of salt affected systems the addition of new functions in the smituv model is a novel approach for solving a real world problem the modified model was used to simulate irrigation scenarios and identify reasonable strategies to prevent salinity stress problems we simulated a mixture of saline groundwater and river water for five different irrigation water scenarios the conventional irrigation practice adds a significant amount of salt in the root zone accelerating the osmotic stress and reducing the plant root water uptake which eventually contributes to the impairment of soil and subsurface water quality irrigation with desalinated water could be an alternative practice that reduces salt from irrigation and thereby mitigating salinity stress issues desalinated water with limited salt concentration is beneficial and viable for arid region agriculture systems the simulated irrigation practice showed almost no effect on the active crop root zone and significantly reduced salt fluxes this study looked at salinity issues of pecan orchards one of the major cash crops and long term investment by local growers farmers irrigation with desalinated water is not very well accepted and applied by growers largely because of its additional cost but the economic evaluation of this study demonstrates that it can be profitable in coarse texture soils the cost of desalinated water does affect the economic outlook to some extent if groundwater use increases soil type also made a key difference in the overall profitability with desalinated water however several other research and operational questions need to be investigated before wider adoption in the region in conclusion our study demonstrated that desalination could be a management method for sustainable agriculture in arid and semi arid regions where salinity problems are pervasive the results of this study can also help lower the agricultural footprint of arid region agricultural systems and serve as a decision making tool for local growers and stakeholders the models developed and used in this study are open source and can be modified for other conditions

9586,water scarcity and soil salinization in arid regions have made desalination a competitive alternative source for irrigation perceptions of a higher cost and other misconceptions about desalinated water have limited its broader usage in agriculture in this study we have focused on understanding the suitability of using desalinated water as a substitute for saline water in the pecan carya illinoinensis orchards of southwest texas pecan is a perennial high value nut crop that cannot be easily replaced therefore it represents a perfect case study for the application of desalinated water a recently developed system dynamic model smituv system dynamic modeling of infiltration solute transport and root water uptake in vadose zone was modified to assess the effects of irrigation with desalinated water when soil water salt content increased above pecan tolerance levels this model simulated five irrigation scenarios with different fractions of river water and saline groundwater as expected to sustain the same level of pecan production a higher amount of desalinated water was needed with increasing amounts of groundwater in the irrigation mix soil texture had a significant influence on the amount of desalinated water required for sandy and silty soils the 100 river water scenario required no additional desalinated water clayey soils could not sustain high production even in a 100 river water scenario an economic analysis showed that pecan operations might be viable in non clayey regions for some irrigation mixture even after factoring in the cost of using desalinated water however current desalination techniques and associated costs were economically unviable for sustaining pecan in regions with saline groundwater and clayey soils this study also demonstrated the application of smituv and system dynamic modeling as a decision making tool to assist growers in understanding the farm scale applicability of desalinated water keywords irrigation

agriculture in arid and semi arid regions of the world river water availability constrained by low precipitation and drought conditions has forced the use of other alternative water resources such as saline groundwater for irrigation similar trends are seen in the rio grande region basin near el paso texas where river water supplies are rapidly declining and marginal quality groundwater with higher total dissolved solids tds is often used to fill the deficit in irrigation water application of such water marginal quality waters has been known to cause soil salinization ayers and westcot 1985 these complex relations between water and salt often mean that arid region agriculture is under both water and salinity stress increasing soil salinity through irrigation water can cause crop system deterioration by reducing the plant root water uptake due to increased osmotic stress this can severely impair photosynthesis and other metabolic processes leading to lower crop yields bernstein 1975 skaggs et al 2006 russo et al 2009 shrivastava and kumar 2015 in such cases the conventional method of reclaiming salt affected soils is to leach salts below the crop root zone van schilfgaarde et al 1974 facilitated by irrigating with excess water than what is required by the crop to meet evapotranspiration needs irrigation water electrical conductivity ec also plays an important role in facilitating appropriate leaching simulations and field experiments conducted by shani and dudley 2001 and ben gal et al 2008 demonstrated that ordinary irrigation water with an ec value of 1 2 ds m 1 demands a higher amount of irrigation by a factor of 1 5 2 than the potential transpiration demand of a plant it is usual to assume a model where the response of crop root water uptake to the increased salinity remains unaffected until a threshold value reaches above which the crop yield reduces rapidly with a small portion of salinity rise miyamoto et al 1986 van genuchten 1987 skaggs et al 2006 russo et al 2009 miyamoto and nesbitt 2011 ganjegunte and clark 2019 some crops are salt tolerant which means those crops have the ability to withstand higher salinity without hampering their normal growth and yield often with increasing salinity the effective soil volume for the water uptake by plant roots is significantly diminished this also has implications for nutrient fertilizer uptake seasonal displacement of salts to the deeper soil occurs during the precipitation period however these salts can move towards the soil surface and develop an inverted salinity profile with deficit irrigation these seasonal dynamics of salt movement within the profile make the soil salinity prediction complicated climate farm management and crop characteristics are also important for assessing salinity impacts climatic factors like temperature and humidity that govern evapotranspiration affect crop salt tolerance capability for instance lower evapotranspiration demands generally correlate to higher tolerance to bulk soil salinity pre plantation irrigation can help in increasing the salt tolerance of crops at later growth stages minhas et al 2020 reviewed the salt tolerance capability of common crops that can be used as general guidelines to deal with the salinity for irrigated agriculture salt tolerance of a crop is defined in relative terms rather than absolute terms the soil salinity measured as ec is accepted as a representative and comparable measure of salinity in the crop root zone maas and hoffman 1977 irrigation water with ec less than 0 7 ds m 1 is considered to be harmless to soils and crops water having an ec value ranging from 0 7 to 3 0 ds m 1 is slightly to moderately harmful and may require additional water to leach salts out of the root zone ayers and westcot 1985 salt leaching is difficult in clayey soils compared to sandy soils because of the texture and hydraulic conductivity clayey soils contain fine texture particles and have very low permeability while sandy soils contain coarse texture particles and are more permeable for water thus the salinity accumulation also varies with different soil texture classes saline soils can often be sodic because of naturally occurring sodium elements that can cause crusting and sealing of soils it can limit the leaching process by lowering water infiltration caused by soil dispersion into the subsurface soils thus soil sodicity is also important to take into account for the salt leaching process salinity distribution is neither uniform with soil depth nor constant with time under field conditions usually it depends on water availability by precipitation and irrigation antecedent soil conditions and leaching practices different models such as the steady state model watsuit rhoades and merrill 1976 and the transient models enviro gro pang and letey 1998 hydrus vogel et al 1996 šimůnek et al 2005 saltmed ragab 2002 swap van dam 2000 and unsatchem šimůnek et al 1996 suarez and šimůnek 1997 were developed and used comprehensively to investigate such complicated salinity dynamics and its relationship with crop growth and yield these models are helpful in providing an adaptable research solution for agriculture sustainability these models differ in the salt water processes simulated and are often difficult to integrate with new components and modify existing components as an alternative a system dynamic model can provide a graphical modeling environment that allows the user to better understand and easily modify the system connections such as soil water crop salt system interactions the system dynamic approach has the capability to model a complex nonlinear dynamic relationship that changes over time it has a graphical modeling structure and uses graphical e g stocks flows converters connectors internal feedback loops and programmatic elements e g functions and equations to simulate the system under observation saysel and barlas 2001 sterman 2000 recently a system dynamics model smituv was developed by poulose et al 2021 that provides an alternative and interactive model to study dynamics of salt transport soil water flow and root water uptake in a multi layered unsaturated soil desalination particularly with solar energy has often been presented as an alternative approach to reduces salts in the marginal water for agriculture subramani and jacangelo 2015 shahzad et al 2017 reca et al 2018 delgado et al 2020 khan et al 2021 the desalination process performed by the reverse osmosis and other techniques have advanced significantly in the last few decades the cost of such desalinated water production also has dropped dramatically tal 2006 elimelech and phillip 2011 aminfard et al 2019 desalinated water could become an alternative source of water to augment irrigation needs for high value crops especially during periods of drought when river water availability for agricultural irrigation is at its lowest optimal crop yields and reduced water requirements for leaching salts below the crop root zone are potential benefits of irrigation with more desalinated water ben gal et al 2009 russo et al 2009 theoretically it is clear that with proper soil management desalinated water can be used for salinity management and maintaining the crop root water uptake capacity this study aims to use a modified smituv model to understand the applicability of desalination in the arid region where the rising salinity problem is affecting crop production the main objective of this study was to investigate the effect of different water mixes groundwater river water and desalinated water on soil salinity dynamics and root water uptake it includes the direct use of groundwater and or river water conventional method and the use of desalinated water alternative method salinization of soils in the arid region continues to be an existential problem often worsened by conventional irrigation practices the problem is particularly severe for perennial orchards grown in the arid region e g pecans however irrigation strategies using desalinated water which can lower salt inputs into the soil have not gained much traction and are not applied yet there is a knowledge gap on the viability of desalination for regional agriculture to fill this research gap the study focused on exploring an alternative irrigation strategy that can sustain commercially viable yield and maximize net profit from pecan production for this purpose the smituv model poulose et al 2021 was modified in the isee stella architect software environment this modeling environment allows for modification in the system connections with relative ease the smituv model was developed by poulose et al 2021 to simulate changes in agroecosystems under the water and salinity stresses the study focuses on el paso county the arid region of southwest texas where cotton and pecan are the main crops grown under water and salinity stress conditions ganjegunte and clark 2019 cotton is an annual highly salt tolerant crop while pecan is a perennial moderately salt tolerant crop often to sustain pecan growth in dry seasons and during drought periods when the river water supply is inadequate farmers pump saline groundwater to make up the deficit however direct use of highly saline groundwater results in the accumulation of salts in the soil profile cox et al 2018 elevated salinity levels lead to a less effective soil volume in the root zone and negatively impact pecan root water uptake and plant development miyamoto et al 1995 ganjegunte et al 2017 the soils in this region vary from fine texture clayey soils to coarse texture sandy soils with such different soil textures subsurface agricultural system processes also vary this study simulated the responses of flood irrigated pecan orchards with different soil types to the application of desalinated water further to assess the viability of such intervention the costs of desalinated water production and application were also investigated for hypothetical pecan orchards in different soil textures 2 materials and methods 2 1 system dynamic model smituv the system dynamic model smituv was developed to simulate the effects of salinity and water stress on root water uptake in the unsaturated zone of flood irrigated land poulose et al 2021 the smituv model was formulated using the stock flow converter based approach and runs on a daily time step poulose et al 2021 developed the smituv model and cross verified the numerical methods by comparing simulation results with the similarly calibrated hydrus outputs the graphical user interface of this model is easy to interpret and visualize the system connections within five feedback loops this dynamically relates different systems to each other through reinforcing and counteracting loops the model structure has three soil layers of depth 30 cm 30 cm and 40 cm and four sectors soil water flow root water uptake solute transport and hydraulic reduction discussed in detail later several physically based and empirical relationships were used to simulate the soil water crop salt systems in the smituv the richards equation was used to model the one dimensional water flow in an unsaturated incompressible soil porous media parissopoulos and wheater 1990 the modified richards equation is formulated as 1 θ t z k dh dz 1 s where θ is the water content in cm3 cm 3 t is the time in days z is the depth of soil layer in cm h is the capillary water suction head in cm and s is the sink term representing the plant root water uptake in cm3 cm 3 day 1 conventional richards equation is solved using a finite difference method to transform it to a discretized form kroes et al 2009 a sink term in the discretized richards equation was used to simulate the root water uptake from each soil layer feddes and zaradny 1978 and modified to introduce osmotic stress van genuchten 1987 the root water uptake capacity depends on the water stress osmotic stress root characteristics and evapotranspiration reduction in the root water uptake is subjected to water stress due to rise in the water pressure head salinity stress due to accumulated salts buildup in the crop root zone and the osmotic potential the equation used to calculate the root water uptake rate s is expressed as 2 s β α h α s t p where β is the normalized root distribution function α h is the soil water stress response function α s is the salinity stress response function and t p is the potential evapotranspiration hydraulic properties of the unsaturated soil were calculated using a set of closed form equations of van genuchten 1980 and capillary model using the equations of mualem 1976 which incorporates soil chemical properties such as sodicity and ph suarez and šimůnek 1997 the advection diffusion equation was used to model the non reactive and non interactive solute transport in the subsurface soil under transient water flow conditions freeze and cherry 1979 van dam 2000 3 θ c t q c z z θ d diff dc dz where c is the total solute concentration per unit volume of soil in g cm3 q is the volumetric flux given by darcy s equation and d diff is the diffusion constant in cm2 per day the hydraulic reduction is a normalized function that indicates a decrease in the effective hydraulic conductivity of soil due to the presence of exchangeable sodium which can result in clay dispersion and swelling of the soil and adverse ph šimůnek et al 1996 suarez and šimůnek 1997 this function is expressed as 4 r r 1 r 2 where r 1 is the normalized function for exchangeable sodium and r 2 is adverse soil ph 2 2 model input parameters the model setup requires a time variable and initial boundary conditions soil hydraulic properties crop data such as root distribution salt tolerance threshold value and evapotranspiration daily precipitation data were obtained from the climate data online cdo national climatic data center ncdc for ten years note that the climatic conditions e g temperature precipitation etc were set to simulate a decade period from 1947 to 1956 which was the driest period in history using the climate for the driest observed period in the recent past represents a worst case water availability scenario grounded in observation the pecan crop is typically irrigated from may to october local growers apply on average 127 mm irrigation depth during the growing season with additional irrigation of 50 mm in march fig 1 the march irrigation is done to leach out the initial excess salts from the soil and for land preparation before the onset of the irrigation season this practice helps push the salts in the root zone deeper and increase pecan root water uptake after first irrigation in may total irrigation water is calculated as the sum of groundwater and river water along with incident rainfall daily salt loads were estimated by the weighted average of salts present in different water sources in el paso county table 1 the effective root water uptake of pecan is based on root distribution beneath the soil full grown pecan roots in soil reach a span of 300 cm on either side and 80 cm in depth miyamoto 1982 fig 2 soil information is obtained for the el paso region of texas from the web soil survey input data rainfall root growth evapotranspiration hydraulic conductivity calcium magnesium and sodium similar to that used by poulose et al 2021 has been utilized in this study other soil inputs the air entry pressure alpha cm 1 and pore size distribution n of the soil water retention curve were adopted from the experiments of schaap and van genuchten 2006 for three soil groups given in table 2 consumptive water use was estimated using monthly potential evapotranspiration obtained from the texas et network and crop coefficient for pecan miyamoto 1982 2 3 modifications in the model the smituv model was modified by adding a water input function a salt input function sectors for the desalination process and a sector for cost estimation in addition osmotic stress response functions were also changed in the original model to trigger irrigation with desalinated water figs 3 and 4 the irrigation water sources explored are groundwater river water and a mixture of both table 1 variation in the salt concentration due to different water sources for irrigation could impact salt inputs and thus the crop root water uptake rate which eventually affects the crop yield skaggs et al 2006 in the model if the soil water ec reaches a critical value for pecan irrigation by desalinated water is triggered until the average soil water ec drops below the ec critical value the ec critical value was set to a threshold according to soil groups the ec critical value of 2 5 ds m was set for sandy soil 1 8 ds m for silty soil and 1 1 ds m for clayey soil based on the experiments conducted by miyamoto et al 1986 and miyamoto and nesbitt 2011 for an arid region pecan orchard the ec critical value is the maximum salinity limit ecmax of the system for pecan survival ec values beyond ec critical value will substantially limit the plant growth and yield if the ec in the soil water is below its critical value it is assumed that the root water uptake is not affected thus the pecan yield remains the same the ec ec critical and ecmax values used in this study are different and set in the model for different purposes the ec value is set for soil water system salt concentration i e salinity in the field the ecmax value is set for the maximum salinity of the soil water system the ec critical value is set as the threshold maximum ec value beyond which pecan growth reduces substantially another module was added to this model to assess the costs of desalination for various scenarios the purpose and their mathematical expressions used for the model development are given in table 3 2 3 1 water input function the water input function is added in the soil water flow sector with the condition that if the salt concentration in the pecan root zone goes beyond the ec critical value then desalinated water will be used for irrigation by the model in all other cases regular irrigation from a mixture of groundwater and river water is applied discussed in section 2 4 this is done to simulate operations where the grower will start using desalinated water once the expected soil water ec is higher than the critical ec and then switch back to regular irrigation once ec values are below the critical value 2 3 2 salt input function the salt input function is added in the salt transport sector to mirror the water input function thus if salt concentration solute in the root zone goes beyond the ec critical value then the salt concentration of the desalinated water 0 0001 g cm3 will be used otherwise the salt concentration total dissolved salts solids tds of the irrigation water mixture will be used 2 3 3 osmotic stress response function we have also modified the smituv model to add crop senescence as a result of salinity induced osmotic stress the osmotic stress function in the root water uptake sector includes the ecmax value representing a level above which the crop dies the conditional expression used to represent senescence is similar to that used before for salt and water input functions once ec in soil water exceeds ecmax water uptake by crop roots is drastically reduced due to salinity stress this function helps maintain the salinity stress in the crop until a threshold ec critical value beyond which the plant will die and not recover even if the ec values improve 2 3 4 two new sectors for desalination process and cost estimation we have added two new sectors in the smituv model fig 4 1 to estimate the total desalinated water used for irrigation and concentrate water reject produced after the desalination process and 2 to estimate the costs of the desalinated water table 3 rejected water is considered 30 of the total raw water used for the desalination process based on literature estimates ahmed et al 2003 mohamed et al 2005 this may vary and depends on the processing unit the total cost of desalinated water used for irrigation is calculated with respect to the minimum and maximum cost of the thousand gallons 3785 41 liters of desalinated water produced given by the texas water development board arroyo and shirazi 2012 2 4 irrigation water scenarios depending on the annual water availability in the rio grande river local pecan growers in the region use a different mix of river water and saline groundwater for irrigation groundwater is used as an alternate water source for pecan irrigation when river water availability and accessibility are not enough to meet crop needs river water availability of course varies with changes in precipitation distribution over this arid region as well as regulated streamflows from the upstream caballo reservoir and elephant butte reservoir in that case water mixing is the only option for irrigation to simulate the scenarios often observed in this arid region five different fractions of river water and saline groundwater were considered table 4 all these scenarios were simulated individually for the pecan using the modified smituv model it is impractical to obtain a commercial crop yield without adding the requisite amount of macro and micro nutrients to the desalinated water for irrigation yermiyahu et al 2007 hence it was assumed that the desalinated water has a 100 mg l salt concentration which can be achieved by combining desalination water with some raw water or the desalination reject we assumed that simulations based on such a water mixture can provide optimal desalinated water use for sustainable agriculture and maximum economic output for local growers these simulations are also helpful to assess the impact of possible alternative irrigation practices on the pecan among the irrigation water scenarios ws1 is entirely based on groundwater source with high salt concentration input from the water most likely in dry years 2021 was estimated to be close to this scenario in comparison ws5 is based on the availability of enough river water to account for all irrigation needs the smituv model is simulated for scenarios ws1 to ws5 table 4 and three soil groups table 2 to compare irrigation practices in the arid region pecan orchard 2 5 cost estimation only the variable costs were allowed to vary among simulations in this study fixed costs that do not depend on desalinated water use were kept constant examples of fixed costs are labor administrative equipment and membrane replacement costs and property fees or taxes as applicable depending on locality the total cost of desalinated water for irrigation relies on a function of the production cost ranges from 0 29 to 0 63 per cubic meter of water given by the texas water development board arroyo and shirazi 2012 and the total volume of desalinated water used v dw for irrigating one hectare pecan field the total cost of desalinated water for irrigation practice is calculated as 5 desalinated water cos t min 0 29 v dw 6 desalinated water cos t max 0 63 v dw 7 net benefit cost pecan market cost average pecan production fixed cost desalinated water cost 8 break even market price fixed cost desali nated water cost average pecan production 3 results 3 1 effect of different water scenarios five irrigation water combinations were simulated to study the impact on the salt concentration solute and water movement root water uptake and salinity stress response for three soil texture groups these results should help compare irrigation practices with desalinated water for pecan growers in the arid region 3 1 1 salt concentration the simulations for pecan show varying cumulative salt concentrations under different water scenarios fig 5 as expected the ws1 simulation with 100 marginal groundwater results in high salt accumulation in the soil while the ws5 simulation with 100 surface water results in low salt accumulation regardless of soil texture class all simulations started with negligible salts content in the soil nevertheless the salt buildup to the critical value happened in one year for ws1 scenario under all three soil types by the end of the second year all irrigation scenarios except ws5 had reached the critical value the results demonstrate that salt concentration decreases in the active root zone as the water scenario changes from groundwater irrigation ws1 to river water irrigation ws5 as constrained by the model by the use of desalinated water once the salt concentration reaches a threshold value ec critical assigned for each soil type it does not increase beyond that level this result shows that the pecan growth can sustain in sandy and silty soils without the use of desalinated water in the ws5 100 river water scenario however in clayey soil a small amount of desalinated water is needed even when irrigating with 100 river water to lower salt accumulation in the root zone and maintain full productivity the result also suggests that for irrigation scenarios except for ws5 there will be some yield reduction at different times in the growing season due to salinity without the use of desalinated water 3 1 2 salinity stress response function hs the results for the salinity stress response function hs show the effect of different irrigation scenarios is limited between 0 85 and 1 fig 6 salinity stress with irrigation from ws1 to ws5 decreases in the root zone and water movement increases across pecan plants cell membranes the prolonged salinity stress in the root zone could lower the water potential in plant cells cause critical cell damage and impact plant development miyamoto et al 1986 shani and dudley 2001 skaggs et al 2006 parihar et al 2015 shrivastava and kumar 2015 as expected the irrigation scenario ws5 produces low salinity stress however the salinity stress for irrigation scenarios ws2 to ws5 ranges from 0 85 to 1 and is controlled by irrigation with desalinated water 3 1 3 pecan root water uptake the effect of different irrigation practices on the pecan root water uptake illustrates no major changes fig 7 it is because of the newly added water function with the condition that if the ecmax reaches a threshold value then use desalinated water this condition prevents salinity stress and maintains the same root water uptake during the simulation period as relative root water uptake can be considered and used in the model as a good proxy for relative crop yield skaggs et al 2006 desalinated water in irrigation helps in consistent pecan growth and production over time however a small difference is observed for total root water uptake between the three soil groups in the clayey soil pecan root uptake is higher by 100 200 cm in 10 years this can be attributed to the higher residual water capacity of clayey soil than sandy and silty soils 3 2 economic evaluation the simulated irrigation practice with desalinated water can help to sustain the pecan yield by minimizing salt concentration in the root zone maximizing root water uptake and minimizing salinity stress on the plants the cost of desalinated water used for irrigation is based on the production cost per cubic meter of water given by the texas water development board the results from this analysis will help us understand the economic feasibility of using desalination water to augment traditional irrigation practice for pecan orchards as the total water requirement varies for different soil texture types the total cost of desalinated water would also vary following different water scenarios and between three soil texture groups fig 8 more desalinated water is required for irrigation in clayey soil to reduce the adverse salinity effect the cost of desalinated water is always higher for clayey soil compared to sandy and silty soils there is no need to use desalinated water when irrigating with 100 river water ws5 hence no additional cost is required for pecan orchards in the sandy and silty soils these results showed that irrigation with desalinated water is desirable when groundwater use increases in fine textured soils this analysis would be beneficial in decision making and evaluating economic feasibility for local growers who may be considering using desalinated water as an optional irrigation source 4 discussion as expected the results show that irrigation with desalinated water can substantially reduce the soil salinity problem associated with the irrigation in pecan orchards in the arid southwest the use of desalinated water appears to be beneficial when the available irrigation water mixture increases salinity stress in the root zone this study shows a significant and consistent effect of irrigation practice with desalinated water shown in figs 5 to 7 this result affirms that desalinated water can help sustain pecan growth and maintain a commercially viable yield jones 2007 othman et al 2014 the ws1 scenario is likely an extreme scenario that accumulates more salts in the pecan root zone than other scenarios thus requiring more desalinated water if irrigation continued with groundwater pecan orchards could suffer irreversible adverse effects of salinity excess accumulation of salts increases the osmotic potential and thus makes less water available for plants this is more critical when soil becomes non permeable non productive and unsuitable for pecan growth also as salts continue to accumulate in soils pecan photosynthetic capability lowers tree trunk size decreases and seedling growth reduces which finally reduces nut yields and deteriorates nut quality under severe salinity stress dieback of tree branches was also observed miyamoto et al 1986 the ws5 scenario is likely an optimistic scenario which is also very unlikely given the past hydrological conditions and the prevalence of droughts in this region and headwaters of the region s reservoirs ws5 accumulates less salts in the pecan root zone thus less or no desalinated water is needed depending on the soil type to sustain the pecan growth the salt concentration analysis showed a significant change in the salinity stress if desalinated water is used for irrigation it seems that removing the salt excess before it reaches the pecan field by means of desalinated water i e the proposed irrigation management may lead to reduced agricultural soil salinity thus irrigation management using desalinated water provides a unique opportunity for sustainable pecan yield and profitable income for local growers while reducing salt accumulation over time sustaining crop yield and reducing soil salinity contributes to meeting the united nations un global sustainable development goals sdgs for agricultural food production in the future shahzad et al 2017 alawneh et al 2019 the sdgs 12 responsible consumption and production 13 climate action and 15 life on land are being addressed from this study the sdg 12 addresses the sustainable consumption and production patterns that ensure the decoupling of socio economic growth and human well being taking into account the resource use and environmental impact the sdg 13 expresses the urgent and meaningful mitigation actions to combat climate change and minimize its disruptions the sdg 15 promotes sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems and their services in line with preventing desertification restoring degraded land and soil and striving to achieve productive land desalinated water use supports these sdgs particularly for arid region agriculture it may be noted that irrigation with desalinated water also needs an efficient water distribution system lower irrigation efficiency tends to use a higher amount of desalinated water and at a higher cost reca et al 2018 an indirect benefit of the low salt content in desalinated water is the cleaning of the irrigation systems although the cost of desalinated water for irrigation is higher than the cost of groundwater and river water the benefits of sustainable crop production may lead to a net profit in some scenarios further modest environmental benefits may also be expected we expect the cost of desalination to fall with wider adoption and technological improvements if the cost of desalinated water decreases then net profit can increase for some scenarios the cost of desalination is relatively low when compared to the total pecan production cost however the capital cost to set up desalination infrastructure will be high and likely similar for all soil irrigation types although not the focus of this study these costs may be addressed by incentives already in place for water conservation from usda and other agencies according to the texas a m agrilife research by nesbitt et al 2013 a pecan orchard incurs a production cost of about 1532 per hectare per year and produces about 1121 2242 kg per hectare per year in 2020 the market price for in shell pecan was about 3 08 per kg according to usda nass 2021 with the simulated irrigation practice an average of 1681 kg of nut production can be achieved the total value of production per hectare could be 5189 and the net benefit per hectare could be 3657 however considering the desalination cost the net benefits from a one hectare pecan orchard could be somewhat lower but sustainable in sandy and silty soils compared to clayey soil table 5 the decision is complicated as other salts and heat tolerant crops e g sorghum may become economically competitive with pecan when profit margins are low however pecan farming is a long term investment and not easy to replace or transition to other crops there is significant infrastructure and knowledge investment also involved which are not easy to replace in the short term thus in the short term desalination may be a good solution for pecan growers that foresee using marginal quality groundwater in some years rejected water stream called the concentrate with a high salt concentration is also produced during desalination that may be a cause of concern particularly in landlocked regions far from sea ocean in our study we considered 30 of rejected water produced from the desalination process fig 9 which may typically vary as much as 20 50 of the feed water volume depending on the quality of raw water because of high salt content disposal of the concentrate is also important for minimizing environmental damages if more quantity of desalinated water is required for irrigation then a proportionally higher volume of rejected water will be produced according to rejection percent there are a few ways that can be used to dispose of the rejected water the evaporation technique can help to reduce the water content of the rejected concentrate and leave the salts behind other methods of commercial salt extraction from desalination rejects may also be explored ahmed et al 2003 alberti et al 2009 el naas 2011 these commercial salt extractions may be able to derive some value from the concentrate water the disposal injection well is another option to treat the rejected water giwa et al 2017 panagopoulos et al 2019 it is generally more economical to inject rejected water into disposal wells than to recycle or evaporate maliva et al 2011 panagopoulos et al 2019 other creative methods that use this water to grow extremely salt tolerant crops and algae in marginal lands jaradat 2005 kashyap et al 2020 may also be explored unique to the study area the river rio grande is lost dry downstream of hudspeth county these areas where the river seldom flows areas are typically high in salt and may be used as beds to try creative salt mitigation strategies eventually the disposed of concentrate in these areas can be discharged back to the river during floods and carried to the gulf of mexico as tds increases in irrigation water more desalinated water is required for sustaining pecan growth and the volume of rejected water could also rise concomitantly however the amount of desalinated water and rejected water varies for different soil groups fig 9 the 100 river water scenario does not use desalinated water in sandy and silty soils hence rejected water will not be an issue in this case but the rejected water could be a major problem in the case of clayey soil as a high amount of desalinated water is required for different water scenarios desalinated water requirement varies affecting the cost of desalination and disposal of rejected water the dynamics between cost rejected water and tds of both soil and water needs to be explored further for sustainable management in arid region agriculture another issue not simulated by the study is the preferential concentration of sodium ions in the produced water by reverse osmosis reverse osmosis membranes reject sodium salts at a lower rate than other salts this can cause some issues with soil sodicity however membranes may be designed and other methods of desalination may be used that can control this operational issue this study looked at one crop of the arid region under the salinity stress condition another management option to sustain agriculture and maintain food security in the region as water becomes more saline is to grow alternative crops that are more salt tolerant and less water intensive with pecan a perennial crop that takes about 5 6 years depending on pecan variety to mature and can produce for over 50 years such rapid transition can be difficult also in exceptional times one may try not to maximize the yield but just aim for tree survival the interplay between market conditions climatic conditions water availability and the outlook of all three will dictate such optimization this study did not look at such behavior but will be of paramount importance to the region modeling scale is a fundamental question in this study we set out to aid farmers and evaluate the sustainability of desalination as an answer to arid region agriculture however we can potentially use some of the results and extend them to the region there are economies of scale and optimization combining farms co locating regional desalination staggered irrigation etc potential that can be explored we will try to investigate this in a future study to extend the applicability of this study approach from farm level to regional level we need to use regional level data as inputs to the model that we considered in this study hence changes in data inputs can make the model scalable from field level to regional level 5 conclusions the system dynamic model smituv was modified and utilized for irrigation simulation and economic evaluation of the arid region pecan orchard where saline groundwater is primarily used to augment reduced river water supplies the use of a system dynamic approach to address the salinity issue is a novelty in agriculture research and promotes understanding of salt affected systems the addition of new functions in the smituv model is a novel approach for solving a real world problem the modified model was used to simulate irrigation scenarios and identify reasonable strategies to prevent salinity stress problems we simulated a mixture of saline groundwater and river water for five different irrigation water scenarios the conventional irrigation practice adds a significant amount of salt in the root zone accelerating the osmotic stress and reducing the plant root water uptake which eventually contributes to the impairment of soil and subsurface water quality irrigation with desalinated water could be an alternative practice that reduces salt from irrigation and thereby mitigating salinity stress issues desalinated water with limited salt concentration is beneficial and viable for arid region agriculture systems the simulated irrigation practice showed almost no effect on the active crop root zone and significantly reduced salt fluxes this study looked at salinity issues of pecan orchards one of the major cash crops and long term investment by local growers farmers irrigation with desalinated water is not very well accepted and applied by growers largely because of its additional cost but the economic evaluation of this study demonstrates that it can be profitable in coarse texture soils the cost of desalinated water does affect the economic outlook to some extent if groundwater use increases soil type also made a key difference in the overall profitability with desalinated water however several other research and operational questions need to be investigated before wider adoption in the region in conclusion our study demonstrated that desalination could be a management method for sustainable agriculture in arid and semi arid regions where salinity problems are pervasive the results of this study can also help lower the agricultural footprint of arid region agricultural systems and serve as a decision making tool for local growers and stakeholders the models developed and used in this study are open source and can be modified for other conditions

atacama desert and under prevailing water scarcity conditions we examined the benefits and costs to four main water users urban agriculture mining and the environment over a 30 year time horizon the main scenarios under consideration include reduced water demand from improved water use efficiency in the urban and agriculture sector and investment in water supply infrastructure including inter basin infrastructure and dams a desalination plant and increased groundwater extraction our findings suggest that implementation of demand side management strategies which in this instance is investment in water use efficiency technology and water conservation measures result in more favourable net benefit outcomes than investment in water supply infrastructures the primary outcome of this study is to help the regional government of tacna peruvian water authorities and water users make more informed decisions about water investment options going forward thereby supporting regional development opportunities keywords drought desalination irrigation subsistence farming mining residential demand supply augmentation 1 introduction managing water resources in basins under semi permanent conditions of scarcity requires proactive management and infrastructure planning molden 2020 competing stakeholders and water users in semi arid basins usually show important power and resource asymmetries e g irrigation versus mining sectors thus triggering potential conflicts which further hinder the efforts to advance collaborative water governance and management galvez et al 2019 to address recurrent water crises and related conflicts peru has embarked on a water reform that included the establishment of a new water law and a new institutional framework for managing water resources roa garcia et al 2015 although peru has 4 2046 million cubic metres per year hereafter mcm year of the world s freshwater resources fao 2021 the hyper to semi arid pacific basin with only 2 of the country s water resources 37 mcm year concentrates most of peru s population 18 5 million out of 27 million and economic activity including irrigation and mining fao 2021 world bank 2013 peru s pacific basin is regarded as highly water stressed oki and quiocho 2020 and managing water resources from a supply perspective is challenging due to i rainfall and streamflow variability and

coastal aquifers salmoral et al 2020 schwarz and mathijs 2017 although the peruvian institutional reforms have enabled stakeholder participation through the creation of local water basin councils and local water administrators paerregaard et al 2016 conflicts among stakeholders over water use and proposed infrastructure projects are still common bebbington and williams 2008 sosa and zwarteveen 2016 in many instances knowledge about the pros and cons of water related projects and demand management measures and their impact on the supply system is not quantitatively assessed with a whole of basin perspective ana 2014a our research aims to help answer the question what are the benefits and costs of alternative water management scenarios it is important for water authorities and water users to understand the benefits and costs of each water demand and supply management decision to make the best investment decision going forward however to properly understand the impact of their decisions on future water availability and the welfare of each water user the analyses underpinning their decisions need to consider the hydrological inter dependencies across water basins the impact on all the water users involved and the uncertainty of the predicted outcome on their decisions without all of this water managers and water users maybe making decisions without a full set of information to make proper trade offs between catchments or trade offs between water users however previously published literature in the economic analysis of irrigation water demand and supply management often focusses on a single production scenario paoletti and shortridge 2020 therefore findings from these studies rarely provide useful insights in a situation where water supply is managed across multiple basins in a production scenario where there are multiple crop types under consideration the same argument applies to the economic analysis of urban water demand and supply in the urban sector often in urban water management studies residential water demand and supply management is considered in isolation of other competing water users such as the commercial industrial and agricultural sector worthington 2010 they therefore fail to capture how allocating water to the residential sector affects the welfare of other water users meanwhile in studies where multiple water users are considered the analysis is often limited to understanding and predicting water demand and supply balance only e g flörke et al 2018 as such these studies miss the economic analysis to quantify the benefits and costs to each of the water users for different management options additionally the outcome of a management decision is often subject to many sources of uncertainty including yield responses commodity prices supply system costs and water availability due to climate change yet previous research in irrigation agriculture rarely comprehensively considers these uncertainties paoletti and shortridge 2020 to overcome these research gaps and limitations our paper investigates hydrological inter dependencies across water basins benefits and costs to different water users and uncertainties around the outcome of each water management decision we present the results of an economic analysis that compares alternative water demand and supply management scenarios in peru when water is managed across multiple water catchments and when there are multiple water users involved the demand and supply management strategies include 1 the implementation of water use efficiency programs in the urban and agriculture sector aimed at reducing demand by 15 2 the augmentation of water supply for agriculture via increased groundwater pumping and inter basin water transfer and 3 the construction of a desalination plant to provide potable water supply to the urban area we analysed the benefits and costs to four main sectors in the region urban agriculture mining and the environment to account for uncertainty we applied a stochastic benefit cost analysis bca using monte carlo simulation to estimate the probabilistic benefits and costs for a series of proposed demand and supply management strategies the assessment is underpinned by a well calibrated water resources management model the model i adequately describes the hydrology of the caplina locumba basin ii includes operational agreements or protocols existing or potential for water sharing iii represents the current or foreseen operation of the existing or potential water infrastructure and iv describes demand management for example including improvements in water use efficiency for irrigation and urban water consumption 2 study area the caplina locumba basin 1 638 900 ha geographically located within the atacama desert is situated in the tacna region first tier administrative level at the southernmost part of the country and borders to the south with chile to the east with bolivia and to the west with the pacific ocean fig 1 the main urban centre is the city of tacna with a population of 358 218 inhabitants ogie 2019 the region is mostly arid and rainfall estimated from september to august for 1969 2004 changes across an altitudinal gradient with mean annual rainfall of less than 10 mm at the coast less than 50 mm in most parts of the basin about 20 mm in tacna and up to 500 mm in the foothills of the andean mountains lavado casimiro et al 2012 rainfall is highly seasonal occurring mostly during the austral summer months december to february the altitudinal gradient also defines the temperature with the annual average mean daily temperature in tacna being 20 c varying from 7 to 28 c and in the andean foothills being 3 c varying from 15 to 20 c the caplina locumba basin is a system of interconnected basins that regulate and convey water to areas of high demand through a series of dams canals and groundwater wells fig 1 a system of surface reservoirs and groundwater wellfields supply water to the city of tacna from the uchusuma maure basin in the andean uplands through a network of tunnels and canals the andean aquifer of el ayro supplements groundwater with about 16 39 mcm year and is jointly operated by the regional government of tacna and the water supply company entidad prestadora de servicios de saneamiento tacna sociedad anónima from here onwards referred to as eps tacna the key water users in the region include copper mining and irrigated agriculture in the rural parts of the region and industrial and urban water use in the vicinity of the city of tacna overall water demand in the tacna region is 677 mcm year based on the volume of allocated water licences while water supply averages only 381 mcm year ana 2014a a key factor in this deficit is the groundwater exploitation of the caplina coastal aquifer for irrigated agriculture in la yarada which amounts to 110 mcm year pino et al 2019 this aquifer is overexploited and currently groundwater discharge rates far exceed recharge rates pino et al 2019 resulting in increased salinity due to saltwater intrusion the proportion of water demand by each sector is 3 7 for urban residential 25 2 mcm year 7 for mining 47 2 mcm year 0 1 for commerce and industry 0 5 mcm year and 89 2 603 9 mcm year for irrigated agriculture ana 2014a despite irrigated agriculture being the largest water user the estimated contribution of this sector to the economic productivity of the tacna region is only 6 9 as compared to mining and commercial users with 17 8 and 14 6 respectively inei 2017 hence the irrigated agriculture sector is not considered a high value user of water however agriculture is an essential component of subsistence living in the region for an estimated one third of the farming population gill 2009 the caplina locumba basin also hosts the largest coastal wetlands in peru called ite bay wetlands fig 1 the ite bay wetlands are located at the mouth of the locumba river covering an area of 1180 ha these wetlands support a number of migratory birdlife and are home to 75 of the birdlife in the region maquera 2017 the wetlands also support the local subsistence farming community that rear goats sheep cattle and pigs within this national context the caplina locumba basin is facing increasing water demand to sustain economic activity and population growth in this region the steady growth in population and resulting economic activity inei 2009 has outpaced the implementation of infrastructure to harvest and manage the scarce water supplies in an already complex supply network further stressing the water system in addition the transboundary nature national and international of the water resources presents an additional practical and institutional challenge for the operators of the complex surface water supply network proyecto especial de tacna pet a unit of the regional government of tacna albrecht et al 2018 opportunities to mitigate water stress have been considered over the years by the local water basin council and other water users and several of these have been partially or fully implemented ana 2014b traditional farming and irrigation practices such as river diversion flood irrigation and terrace farming are used widely in the basin resulting in low irrigation efficiencies in the range 40 55 therefore investment in improved irrigation systems and agricultural practice would significantly reduce the demand for water from this sector while not compromising on the welfare and well being outcomes for these communities meanwhile in the urban sector water is still rationed through the city and many users do not have 24 7 access to potable water despite the existing supply treatment plant operating at full capacity radio uno 2020 the reason for this shortfall is because the current supply treatment plant does not produce enough potable water to meet existing demand additionally the distribution network still does not reach every household in the urban area construction of a desalination plant or an increased share of existing water allocations has the potential to provide urban users with the water they require but will also require an effective payment mechanism del saz salazar et al 2016 at the same time demand management strategies to reduce urban water demand at household and business level could help reduce inefficient use of water brooks 2006 there are also options to expand existing reservoirs to increase their water supply capacity these options could be done at a lower cost than the desalination plant 3 method the impacts of climate change and regional development from agricultural and population growth on the benefits and costs of water resources development in the caplina locumba basin were explored through a series of scenarios to capture the interdependencies among the basins water supply and demand were modelled using a water management model built with the ewater source integrated modelling platform https ewater org au products ewater source welsh et al 2013 the development of the model for the surface water system included the modelling of water supply and demand i rainfall runoff modelling ii river system modelling that includes the natural and anthropic physical characteristics reservoirs offtakes channels irrigation urban centres etc and iii management rules of operation of the water infrastructure surface and groundwater the model for the surface water system has been coupled to a groundwater numerical model of el ayro aquifer developed in modflow harbaugh et al 2000 the operation of both models has been verified by means of coherent and comparable values for key components of the water balance the model topology and its calibration results are described in the supplementary information section s 1 showing that the supply demand system is adequately represented in the model in terms of water availability and demand both in magnitude and temporal patterns climate change projections were implemented focusing on changes in precipitation temperature and potential evaporation across the caplina locumba basin change projections were obtained using empirical scale factors which reflect the change in the climate variables in the future 2046 2075 relative to current climate variables chiew et al 2009 this reference climate projection developed for all of peru is derived from the analysis of change signal in the cmip5 global climate models gcm used and analysed in the ipcc ar5 fifth assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change climate change projections were used to produce input data for the water management model to project the availability of water resources for a dry future these projections are described in the supplementary information section s 3 1 the methods to estimate population growth are based on a long term population growth rate of 2 which is in line with methods currently used in the peruvian national census inei 2009 with this method the estimated population in the city of tacna by 2026 is 429 708 inhabitants value that is used in the scenario analysis water availability to each end user in each catchment was then used as input into the bca to deal with uncertainty around the availability of water resources crop price mineral price crop yield multiplier from improved irrigation efficiency and water efficiency measure costs we applied a stochastic bca method to account for the uncertainty around the benefits and costs of water demand and supply planning scenarios specifically monte carlo simulations were used to estimate the probability that the benefits of demand management changing water supply allocation and water supply infrastructure investment would outweigh the costs for each of the scenarios under consideration the advantage of applying the stochastic bca is that we could examine the robustness of the net benefit outcome if the benefits and costs were to change paoletti and shortridge 2020 the software program used to perform the stochastic bca is called risk an add in to microsoft excel that permits the evaluation of stochastic benefit and cost outcomes using monte carlo simulations palisade 2016 output from risk will demonstrate the likelihood that a benefit will outweigh the costs given the uncertainty around various input variables decision makers can make more informed decisions around water management benefits and costs and the risks involved in making any of their decisions using this framework we applied a scenario analysis method to evaluate the benefits and costs of alternative water demand and supply management decisions under climate change and regional development these decisions include implementation of demand management activities to encourage water use efficiency changing water supply allocation availability to various users and water supply augmentation through the expansion of existing infrastructure or the investment in new infrastructure 3 1 scenario analysis several future water management scenarios for the tacna region were agreed with stakeholders through a consultation process consisting of a series of expert interviews and workshops see section 3 7 the scenarios were modelled to assess their benefits and costs against hydrologic and economic baseline conditions hereafter referred to as baseline scenario a these scenarios include various combinations of 1 a scenario where water use efficiency is put in place and there is no investment in new water infrastructure 2 a scenario where a desalination plant is constructed to provide a climate resilient source of water and 3 a scenario where groundwater pumping and inter basin transfers from the uchusuma maure basin are augmented these scenarios were representative of the key recommendations of previous investigations into water security for the region ana 2014a gore tacna 2013 aspects considered included the potential development of irrigated agriculture a population increase and an increase in water use efficiency satisfying future water demands will require new investments which will have an impact on magnitude and time of water availability the construction of dams inter basin transfers and or use of groundwater in order to satisfy future demand will have effects on the magnitude and seasonality of streamflow as well as on the sustainability of the aquifers in the case of new dams the operation destined to store water during the austral summer months rainy season december to february and the gradual discharge according to demand will modify the volume and seasonality of the flows in regimes that were previously poorly regulated on the other hand the modernization of irrigation and the improvement of multi sectoral efficiency will tend to reduce demand through a combination of structural and non structural measures the agreed scenarios examined in the bca are summarised in table 1 and further described below the catchments being considered are ilabaya locumba and uchusuma caplina note that the uchusuma caplina catchment connects the uchusuma maure and the caplina catchments through the canal uchusuma alto and other canals and tunnels as previously mentioned water supply and demand for a baseline scenario a were modelled with the water management model the water use efficiency scenario a was assessed for all the study area the water use efficiency scenario under historical a and dry b climate was assessed in the catchments of ilabaya and locumba by efficiency we assume an improvement in water use in irrigation of 15 by switching from traditional flood irrigation to drip irrigation and hence a reduction in water licence volumes the current irrigation efficiencies in the area are about 40 ana 2010 an irrigation efficiency of 55 has been achieved in projects with experience and tradition in irrigation in the andean area it is possible to improve efficiency with economical irrigation methods for example from 40 in gravity systems to 75 in sprinkler irrigation systems olarte hurtado and quispe vergara 2006 management of allocation through volumetric water controls have also increased efficiency in the large 1 000 000 ha coastal irrigation system in chancay lambayeque vos and vincent 2011 the assumption of 15 efficiency gain is also used for the urban sector in the urban sector achieving a 15 efficiency is possible with a combination of technology and behaviour change both in the residential and commercial sectors gregory and hall 2011 in this analysis we only focus on efficiency gains in the agricultural and urban sectors as their combined demand comprise more than 93 of total water demand in the region ana 2014a investment for desalination in scenario da could improve the security of water supply in the urban area of tacna however desalinating seawater can be costly the levelized cost of a desalination plant was estimated by sedapal servicios de agua potable y alcantarillado at around pen 1 800 000 per mcm macera 2018 here we analyse the benefits and costs of investment in a desalination plant for the two key water users in the uchusuma caplina catchment urban and agriculture it was assumed that all the water produced by the desalination plant will be used to meet urban demand i e all urban demand is met thus freeing up surface water for use by the agricultural sector meanwhile the urban sector will demand 15 less water than normal when compared to the baseline scenario because more efficient measures in the use of water are being implemented in the urban area of tacna therefore the water supplied to the agricultural sector increases while the water supply to the urban sector decreases in the inter basin augmentation aa scenario we examine the costs and benefits associated with expanding el ayro s wellfield capacity to 31 53 mcm year and investing in the inter basin transfer project vilavilani ii pet 2011 it should be taken into account that the expansion of el ayro to 31 53 mcm year occurs both in the baseline a and in the alternative scenario aa therefore the main difference in investment cost between these two scenarios comes from the cost of building vilavilani ii water supply and use in each of the scenarios will change according to the conditions described in table 1 including groundwater changes in el ayro aquifer water supply probability distributions from the water management model based on each scenario were used to estimate the benefit cost of each scenario relative to the baseline scenario the water supply for the scenarios was apportioned within the catchment domain to the different existing users be them population agriculture mining or wetlands 3 2 specification of economic benefits the net benefit for each scenario is composed of the revenue generated by each of the water users including farm income income from water sales and income from mining this study uses monetary values in peruvian nuevo sol or pen with a conversion factor of pen 1 usd 0 31 which was the exchange rate at the time the bca was conducted source www xe com 2018 3 2 1 farm income one of the key economic factors that will be directly affected by the change in the availability of water supply is the agricultural sector the agricultural sector uses approximately 89 2 of the total water supply in tacna ana 2014a recovering water from this sector will increase the availability of water supply to other users however in doing so we must consider the possible loss of agricultural income due to lower water supply availability in this analysis we assume that the agricultural baseline income has the following specification 1 farm revenue pen j 1 j pc j rc j sc j where pc j is the farm gate price of crop j pen tonne rc j is the yield of crop j tonnes ha and sc j is the area of crop j ha note that 2 sc j dc de j where de j is the water demand of crop j m3 ha and dc is the availability of water m3 ha to the agricultural sector if the availability of water per hectare is less than the average crop water demand we assume that farmers will have to reduce the number of hectares of land to grow their produce and as a result reduce the total yield and farm income for that year historical data on crop area by type of crop for the period of 2001 2015 and monthly production of agricultural produce for the period of 2001 2015 were used to estimate the average minimum and maximum values and standard deviation of total crop yield by crop type per hectare per year documents from the ministry of agriculture of peru on the agroclimatic conditions for key crops provided information on the demand for water by type of crop for each of the three hydrographic basins in tacna see table s 3 in the supplementary information for estimated water demand mcm ha by crop type the data on farmgate price for key crops were obtained from values tabulated in dra tacna 2015 during the period 2010 2015 the price of crops fluctuated significantly to account for the uncertainty around farmgate prices we performed a distribution fit in risk palisade 2016 to fit a distribution on the price variable rather than use a constant price for each crop the supplementary information table s 4 shows the distribution of farmgate price by crop type constructed based on farmgate price information during the period 2001 2015 for each catchment we selected three crops with the highest water allocations as the three main crops for calculating agriculture revenue this is to simplify the agriculture revenue calculation in consultation with experts in the tacna region table s 5 in the supplementary information provides a summary of the three main crops and the share of agriculture water use for each catchment 3 2 2 agricultural water use efficiency it was assumed in this analysis that the introduction of water efficiency measures in the agriculture sector is a result of 15 of allocation being cut to this sector hence farmers have no choice but to improve their productivity with the same amount of water as a result we assume that farmers switch from traditional flood irrigation with an open channel distribution system to a pressurized drip irrigation system the benefits of switching to a pressurized drip irrigation system is improved water use efficiency and productivity playan and mateos 2006 demonstrated that the benefit of changing irrigation system from surface to sprinkler in field crops such as maize is twofold 1 a significant reduction in irrigation water demand roughly from 12 000 to 7000 m3 ha and 2 a 20 increase in crop yield typically from 10 000 to 12 000 kg ha to capture improve productivity because of switching to a pressurized drip irrigation system in scenarios where water use efficiency is introduced we multiplied crop yield by a stochastic factor that ranges between 1 and 1 2 following a beta distribution note that water saved from water use efficiency will be allocated downstream and the benefits of that additional water will be captured in other catchments 3 2 3 urban water sales revenue the change in water supply to the urban sector will have an impact on the income of the service provider eps tacna since the rates are based on the volume of water consumed by users in this analysis the basic income for the service provider is calculated using the following formula 3 water sales revenue pen pa s ua s where pa s is the price of urban water by sector s pen m3 and ua s is the water use m3 by sector s based on tacna water billing information extracted from the eps tacna reports on water consumption by category 2001 2015 we estimated the average minimum maximum and standard deviation of the price of urban water for each sector including domestic commercial industrial state and social the figures shown in table 2 were used as input parameters to estimate income from urban water sales for this analysis the consumer price index was used to adjust these average prices to the 2017 2018 values using the same data set basic water consumption for each sector was also established according to these figures it is evident that domestic water use is the highest in the urban sector consuming around 76 of the total water supply 3 2 4 urban water use efficiency it was assumed in this analysis that the introduction of water efficiency measures in the urban sector will lead to a 15 water savings across all five types of urban water users hence 15 less water will be allocated to the urban sector in the case of tacna 15 of water saved in the urban sector will be transferred to the agriculture sector and the benefits of such savings will be accrued by growers in that region in other catchments water saved from the urban sector will be transferred to downstream catchments where users will realize the benefit of extra water availability 3 2 5 revenue from mining ana 2014a provides the basic water demand for the mining sector on the amount of water consumed by the mining company southern peru copper corporation spcc per year according to the report spcc requires 51 mcm year 20 mcm year of groundwater from the suches vizcachas aquifer and 31 mcm year of surface water from the callazas tacalaya and cinto rivers an increase or decrease in the amount of water supply available to the mining sector will have an impact on mining revenue from this analysis we specified mining revenue from water use as 5 mining revenue pen p m r m where p m is the price of the mineral m pen tonnes and r m is the yield of the mineral m tonnes year note that 6 r m dm de m where de m is the demand for mining water m m3 year and dm is the availability of water m3 year to the mining sector production level of copper and molybdenum during 2012 2106 were sourced from southern copper 2016 the main mineral mined in the tacna region is copper followed by molybdenum zinc gold and silver in this analysis we focused only one two types of minerals copper and molybdenum since the combined output of these two minerals are nearly 99 of minerals mined in the tacna region table 3 provides a summary of the proportion of minerals mined water use to mine each mineral and the average market price per tonne the market price of copper and molybdenum during 2012 2016 came from www iwgcopper com and www metalary com respectively price of copper was validated against the price of copper as reported in southern copper 2016 as the price of copper and molybdenum are exogenous factors and controlled by world market prices we captured price uncertainty by representing price in the analysis as a distribution rather than a fixed value the distributions reported in table 3 are based on usd values we used a conversion factor of pen 1 usd 0 31 source www xe com 2018 to convert copper and molybdenum prices to pen 3 3 specification of costs the cost of water management decision making consists of three major components 1 the cost of investment in new infrastructure including the cost of upgrading or expanding old infrastructure 2 the cost of implementing demand management measures or water efficiency measures to reduce water consumption and 3 the cost of wetland loss if not enough water is sent downstream to service ite bay wetlands 3 3 1 cost of infrastructure investment there are several infrastructure investment options under consideration by the national and the regional government of tacna we assumed that the cost in the baseline scenario a was pen 0 because there were no changes to management practices nor infrastructure expansion a list of investment options and the details of each option are presented in table 4 cost estimates for options 1 5 and 7 were retrieved from previously conducted feasibility analyses pet 2009a 2009b 2011 2014 2015 2016 for the desalination plant option 6 we used the cost estimate by sedapal as reported in macera 2018 according to sedapal converting a cubic meter of seawater to fresh water would require a cost of pen 1 80 note that the investment costs for callazas dam is represented as a distribution rather than a fixed value due to uncertainties around the cost estimates all investment costs were converted to a levelized cost which represents the lifetime cost of the technology average per mcm this method accounts for the full capital including replacement costs and operating costs of a project over its life period by converting all investment costs to levelized costs we can compare the net present value benefits of alternative investment projects with different scales of operations investment and operating periods or both cooley and phurisamban 2016 the levelized cost function is specified as 7 levelized cost of water pen year cc frc om r capacity where cc is capital cost frc is capital recovery factor om is annual operation and maintenance cost r is replacement cost capacity is the total capacity of the infrastructure the frc is specified as 8 frc r 1 r n 1 r n 1 where n useful life in years and r discount rate 3 3 2 cost of implementing urban water use efficiency there are costs to eps tacna for implementing water use efficiency programs the assumptions used for estimating the cost to enhance urban water use efficiency is based on the levelized cost of implementing water use efficiency programs in australia such as shower head change control of leakage and industrial and commercial audit activities we based these cost estimates on australian figures as we currently do not have the levelized cost of implementing a water use efficiency program in tacna but do have access to detailed data from equivalent programmes in australia also the cost estimates from australia include the cost of implementing water use efficiency to the residential and commercial sector table s 6 in the supplementary information provides levelized cost estimates for implementing each of the 15 water use efficiency programs given that these numbers were from australia we introduced the cost of implementing urban water use efficiency measures as a distribution rather than a fixed value to capture the uncertainty around the cost of this variable 3 3 3 cost of implementing agricultural water use efficiency we assumed that farmers switch from traditional flood irrigation with an open channel distribution system to a pressurized drip irrigation system the cost of switching to a pressurized drip irrigation system was based on calculations for pressurised drip irrigation systems where 1800 ha of crops with pressurized irrigation will be delivered into ite and had an investment of pen 12 9 million sin fronteras 2017 in this analysis we assumed that the installation of a pressurized drip irrigation system would lead to 15 reduction in water use in agriculture overall the average cost used to estimate the cost of achieving water use efficiency in agriculture is pen 7167 per hectare the number of hectares is based on the same number of hectares used to calculate the agriculture revenue for each catchment and scenario 3 3 4 loss of environmental value due to limited information on the value of environmental assets and ecosystem services in the tacna region in this analysis we only evaluated the impact of water supply shortages to the ite bay wetlands in the baseline scenario a we assume that these wetlands are maintained at a status quo ecological level if the amount of water reaches or exceeds a reference amount the environmental value of the wetland is maintained we assume that the wetland only uses the amount of water it needs to maintain the status quo and releases the excess into the ocean in the alternative scenario a and b the possibility of reduced water availability will result in a reduction of the area of the wetland and therefore the total value to the environment decreases the assumption is that reduced surface water flow to the wetlands due to excessive water use upstream will result in a reduction in the size of the wetland ha which in turn leads to a reduction in the ecosystem services value of the ite bay wetlands the reduction in the environmental value is calculated based on the use and non use values maquera 2017 estimated the total use value to be pen 277 218 and the non use value to be pen 3045 hence the total economic value of the wetland was pen 280 263 according to the analysis by maquera 2017 the total ecosystem value of the ite bay wetlands is usd 71 97 ha year given the size of the wetlands the total economic value of the wetland was estimated to be 9 total ecosystem value usd year value per hectare x total area of wetland 1 180 ha usd 71 97 ha year usd 84 924 6 year given these estimates and calculations the average cost of wetland loss in the alternative scenario is assumed to be pen 237 51 ha year 3 4 net benefit specification the merit of each water management option was assessed using the bca framework and expressed in terms of the net present value of the net benefit the objective is to choose the option that provides the higher or highest net benefit value the net present value of the net benefit function is expressed as 10 npv i t 0 t tb i t 1 r t t 0 t tc i t 1 r t where npv i is the net present value i e the total benefit tb minus the total cost tc of option i t is the time horizon of the alternative which is expressed in years t t 0 1 t and r is the discount rate the time horizon t is included to account for the fact that benefits and costs may occur at different times 3 5 other specifications and assumptions the time horizon of the analysis is 30 years for the period 2018 2047 the discount rate r is represented as a stochastic variable that follows a general beta distribution α1 2 α2 2 min 0 063 max 0 077 we assume no investment cost in the mining sector in response to water allocation cuts under water use efficiency scenarios and that the only cost to this water user comes from the loss in revenue due to reduced water availability for production 3 6 sensitivity analysis the robustness of the benefit cost outcome in this analysis is checked against changes to climate conditions we carried out a sensitivity analysis under the assumption of historical climate versus a drying climate as described in the supplementary information s 3 1 other uncertainties in key parameter values used to calculate the costs and benefits of each scenario are captured via the stochastic input variables 3 7 stakeholder consultation we performed stakeholder consultation processes in the form of personal interviews and three workshops with experts and decision makers to ensure that the details of the hydrological and economic models were as realistic and suitable for supporting decision making as best as possible therefore stakeholders were consulted before during and after the hydrological and economic models were performed the first workshop was conducted with the objective to arrive at an agreed upon set of parameter values data sources assumptions and variables of interest for sensitivity analysis we then conducted a second workshop to present the progress of the hydrological and economic models to ensure that the models were correctly calibrated and to discuss any issues that need to be overcome the third and final workshop was conducted to validate the findings from the hydrological and economic models the stakeholders involved in these processes include decision makers and experts from the regional government of tacna the national water authority autoridad nacional del agua ana eps tacna southern peru copper corporation and jorge basadre grohmann national university 4 results this section presents results from a selection of benefit cost scenario analysis to evaluate the differences between benefits and costs to the tacna region from implementing various water management scenarios against the baseline scenario a the scenarios being examined in the benefit cost analyses are baseline water use a water use efficiency under historical climate a water use efficiency under dry climate b desalination da and inter basin augmentation aa see table 1 for scenario description the sub catchments within the caplina locumba basin being considered for scenario assessment are ilabaya locumba and uchusuma caplina hydrological outputs used for estimating the costs and benefits of each scenario are based on distributions from the hydrological modelling for reference table 5 summarises the mean value of the quantity of water to each user under each scenario that is used in the benefit cost analysis 4 1 water use efficiency in ilabaya catchment under normal and dry climate we conducted a bca for the ilabaya catchment to evaluate the benefit and cost outcomes of introducing water use efficiency measures there are three main water users in this catchment agriculture mining and urban table 6 shows the changes in benefits and costs for scenarios a and b relative to the baseline scenario a notice that the cost under the baseline scenario a is pen 0 as no water demand nor supply management actions were taken in scenario b the benefit is reduced because water allocation has been reduced to each user by 15 and the cost is accrued to agriculture and urban users as they are required to cope with reduced water supply by implementing water use efficiency measures as previously mention the cost of investing in water efficient technology in the mining sector is beyond the scope of this analysis note that a 15 reduction in water allocation to the urban and mining sectors translates directly into a 15 reduction in revenue to the urban water service provider and the mining company however the agriculture sector suffers less revenue reduction only a 2 reduction because we assumed that the agriculture sector was able to improve productivity by replacing traditional irrigation methods with a pressurized drip irrigation system however the cost to the agriculture sector for investing in a pressurized drip irrigation system is larger than the cost to the urban sector for implementing water efficient measures see scenario a the cost to both sectors becomes lower when the climate is dry see scenario b the reason the cost of implementing water use efficiency under a drying climate scenario is lower is because water is made available to fewer end users in the region therefore less investment is required to build more infrastructure or invest in water use efficiency measures the key finding from this analysis is that the alternative scenarios a and b present a net benefit outcome that is lower than that of the baseline scenario a the main reason is because the cost of having to invest in irrigation infrastructure or water use efficiency measures outweigh the benefits accrued fig 2 present a probability density function of the expected benefit that is accrued from the baseline scenario a in comparison to scenario a and scenario b note that the expected net benefit distribution of scenario b sits slightly more to the left of the distribution of scenario a than a indicating a lower expected benefit from scenario b in comparison to the other two scenarios 4 2 water use efficiency in locumba catchment under normal and dry climate the locumba catchment is downstream of the ilabaya catchment when water use efficiency is introduced in the ilabaya catchment more water is made available downstream in the locumba catchment we present findings from the bca of scenarios a a and b in the locumba catchment there are four main water users in this catchment agriculture environment urban and mining the environment in this case are the wetlands in ite results from the bca is presented in table 7 in the locumba catchment the cost of implementing water use efficiency measures in the agricultural and urban sector is pen 250 280 million the outcome of introducing water use efficiency is a reduction in the expected benefit of around pen 330 360 million relative to the baseline scenario a note that although more water is flowing downstream towards the ite wetlands in scenario a the amount of water is greater than what is required to maintain the status quo condition of the wetlands hence the water is assumed to flow out the river mouth into the ocean and thus there is no further wetland loss it is very likely that there will be benefits to the marine ecosystem from more water flowing into the ocean however the appraisal of the benefits and costs for the marine ecosystems is beyond the scope of this analysis fig 3 provides a visual representation of the differences in the expected benefit of the three scenarios the expected benefit distribution of scenario a and b sit to the left of the distribution of scenario a indicating a lower expected net benefit from scenario a and b as compared to the baseline however there is very little difference in net benefit between scenario a and b 4 3 infrastructure investment in uchusuma caplina catchment three types of infrastructure investment are being considered in this catchment 1 extracting more water from el ayro aquifer 2 construction of a desalination plant and 3 construction of the vilavilani ii inter basin infrastructure the baseline scenario examines the net benefit of investing only in the expansion of el ayro aquifer to extract more water up to 31 53 mcm year scenario a this is contrasted against scenario da where the city constructs a desalination plant and around 15 mcm year of water from the desalination plant is supplied to the urban sector in addition to the existing 1 5 mcm year from surface water the third scenario is examining the net benefit of the expansion of el ayro aquifer to extract more water and the construction of the vilavilani ii infrastructure the new vilavilani ii infrastructure will provide another 33 89 mcm year 4 3 1 desalination for urban water use investment in desalination for water use in cities could improve the security of water supply in the urban area of tacna in the future the desalination plant will meet the urban water sector demand which has been in deficit all these years however desalinating seawater has a cost the levelized cost of a desalination plant was estimated by sedapal macera 2018 at around pen 1 8 million per mcm the benefits and costs of investing in a desalination plant were analysed for the two key users of water in the uchusuma caplina basin namely urban and agriculture the assumption is that all the water produced by the desalination plant will be used to satisfy urban demand as such some surface water can be freed up and given to the agricultural sector meanwhile the urban sector will demand 15 less water compared to the baseline because water use efficiency measures are being implemented in the urban area of tacna therefore in this analysis the water supplied to the agricultural sector increases while water supply to the urban sector decreases i e the urban sector uses water from the desalination plant instead table 8 provides a summary of the benefits and costs of these three scenarios fig 4 shows a comparison between the expected benefit distribution from scenario da and aa as compared to the baseline a the distribution shows the expected net benefit of scenario da and aa are both less than the expected benefit of scenario a and that scenario aa shows more variation in the net benefit outcome than the other two scenarios despite benefits gained from being able to increase agriculture activity the cost of sourcing water from desalination is substantial pen 348 million once combined with the cost of implementing urban water use efficiency of pen 19 million the total cost of scenario da outweighs the benefits one option to reduce the large discrepancy between the cost and benefit is for the urban water service provider to charge more for water produced by the desalination plant in countries like australia the price of potable water supplied to the household is calculated to be at least equal to the long term marginal cost of the portfolio of water infrastructure hence the water utility is not running its operation at a loss 4 3 2 vilavilani ii inter basin infrastructure in this scenario we examine the costs and benefits of expanding the capacity of el ayro aquifer to 31 53 mcm year and investing in the vilavilani ii inter basin infrastructure 33 89 mcm year the scenarios under consideration are a and aa note that the expansion of el ayro to 31 53 mcm year occurs both in the baseline a and the alternative scenario aa therefore the main difference in the investment cost between these two scenarios stem from the cost of constructing vilavilani ii since we are examining the impact of this water management strategy in uchusuma caplina only two water users are considered urban and agriculture table 8 shows the expected benefits and costs of implementing scenario aa the net benefit accrued from expanding el ayro and investing in vilavilani ii is substantially lower than the baseline this stems from a significant investment in water supply infrastructure to both urban and agriculture water users hence the investment in el ayro expansion and vilavilani ii will not result in a favourable economic outcome fig 4 demonstrates the magnitude of the expected net benefit from scenario aa relative to the baseline scenario a and da scenario aa is more favourable than scenario da but both offer negative net benefits 5 discussion we performed a stochastic bca of multiple water demand and supply management scenarios in the catchments of ilabaya locumba and uchusuma caplina examining how the four different types of water users urban agriculture mining and the environment are impacted under each scenario given the connectedness nature of water supply in the tacna region a change in water management strategy in an upstream catchment could create significant economic and environmental change to the corrresponding downstream catchment for this reason it was important for the hydrological model to account for the inter dependencies between the catchments and the impact any change in water demand and supply management practices may have on water availability as a result we were also able to quantify the change to the multiple water users in each of the catchments this type of modelling is often lacking in the current literature as previously discussed given the hydrological inter dependencies between different catchments our hydrological model was able to represent how water conservation measures in the ilabaya catchment translated to more water made available downstream in the locumba catchment as a result of water efficiency measures in the agriculture and urban sector in both the ilabaya catchment and locumba catchments more water was made available to flow through to the ite wetlands resulting in zero loss to the wetlands however this of course comes at a cost to those who were involved in the introduction of water conservation measures given the uncertainty in water availability crop price crop yield and supply system costs we demonstrated that although two management scenarios may produce similar benefit cost outcomes i e expected net benefit one scenario is may still be less favourable than the other due to the uncertainty of the expected outcome i e larger standard deviation without incorporating stochasticity in the analysis we may conclude that the expected outcomes of these two management strategies are the same when in fact they are quite different therefore the application of the stochastic bca framework enables policy makers to make more informed decisions around water management benefits and costs and the risks involved in order to make the trade offs that suits their strategic direction our results suggest that water use efficiency programs in both the urban and agriculture sector offer positive net benefits albeit lesser net benefit than the status quo this analysis may change if we include the dollar benefit of increased water supply certainty to all the water users however the dollar benefit of water supply reliability difficult to measure and risk based approaches are often recommended instead black et al 2015 the bca reveals that the price of water plays an important role in influencing the outcome if water were to be priced based on the long run marginal cost of the water supply technology or priced based on how scarce it is then the benefit estimates will improve having said that scarcity pricing zetland 2021 should only be implemented once we can ensure that all basic water needs are met it must be emphasized that social equity comes first and that the objective of scarcity pricing is not to price low income people out of their rights to have access to water required for living the decision to implement water efficiency measures is a good one however if the cost of implementing other non technology related options is available at a lower cost those options should be implemented first suggestions include the use of nudges i e normative messaging to encourage people to use less water or compliance normative enforcement and optimised monitoring to facilitate sustainable management castilla rho et al 2019 in australia a set of information on residential water bill to show how a household is consuming water relative to other households of the same number of occupants have been shown to reduce household water consumption see fielding et al 2013 following this method households did not have to buy any new technology and still show reduction in per capita consumption as mentioned in the methodology section there are a number of assumptions that underpin these results and we have tried to best capture the uncertainties where there is lack of concrete information by introducing uncertainties into the analyses for this reason our benefit and cost estimates can be represented by a probability density function rather than one fixed value there are some limitations to this analysis that we would like to point out so that more information could be collected in the future to improve upon the benefit cost analysis firstly for each catchment we selected three crops with the highest water allocations as the three main crops for calculating agriculture revenue this is to simplify the agriculture revenue calculation in the future more crops should be added the value of small scale farming such as subsistence living llama farms in the northern parts of the region should also be included in future analyses note that particular for farming for subsistence living the benefit is beyond a commercial one there are also benefits associated with quality of life as well as cultural and heritage values that should also be considered secondly we do not have information on the cost of applying water use efficiency measures in the urban sector for tacna hence we had to use cost data from australia in the future an analysis of the cost of implanting water use efficiency measures should be conducted specifically for tacna thirdly we assumed an average cost of applying water use efficiency measures in tacna based on the average value of installing pressurized drip irrigation in ite in the future the cost of applying water use efficiency in agriculture should be based on the location of the investment and the type of water efficient measure being implemented fourthly we assumed that the benefit and cost adjustment to changes in water allocations is linear and instantaneously future analysis could be improved by including non linear and lag effects of reduced water allocation to each of the water users differently lastly we did not calculate the cost or benefit of 15 water use efficiency for mining as we do not have sufficient data to estimate neither the costs nor the benefits we therefore acknowledge the multi sectorial analysis presented in this work represents a conservative benefit cost appraisal as opportunities for improved water efficiency measures through implementation of suitable technologies in the mining sector are unexplored there are a number of economic benefits not included in this analysis that could substantially change the outcome of some of these scenarios these benefits include the benefits of increased ecosystem services from more water going to wetlands rivers and marine ecosystems surface water and groundwater dependent ecosystems have been shown to have both economic and environmental values in australia see e g tapsuwan et al 2010 tapsuwan and polyakov 2016 tapsuwan et al 2015 the value of environmental assets and its ecosystem services should be evaluated in order to improve the accuracy of the costs and benefits of allocating water for the environment tourism values if environmental conditions improve could increase significantly along with other types of ecosystem services including provisioning regulating supporting and other cultural services there are also social and health physical and mental benefits from water supply security to all users that were not accounted in this analysis such as job security income security quality of life sanitation and overall happiness and well being we therefore encourage future research into these following areas environmental and social values of water agua 2008 6 conclusion managing water demand and supply in an arid region is a complex and difficult problem especially when water supply flows across multiple water catchments and when there are many water users involved the problem becomes even more complicated when there is uncertainty around water supply availability from year to year due to climate change and constant changes in economic factors such as crop price there are also benefits and costs that have no market value such as the economic impact to the environment in the form of shadow prices without applying a robust economic analysis to the problem not all the pros and cons of each water management decision could be carefully considered possibly leading water managers to make management decisions that lead to an overall lower societal welfare this paper presents a stochastic bca that was able to capture some of the complexity and uncertainty in water demand and supply management findings from this

9587,this paper presents findings from a stochastic benefit cost analysis bca using monte carlo simulations to estimate the probable values for net benefit and benefit cost ratio for a series of proposed strategic and operational water management options under climate change and socioeconomic development the study is performed in the tacna region in southern peru geographically within the atacama desert and under prevailing water scarcity conditions we examined the benefits and costs to four main water users urban agriculture mining and the environment over a 30 year time horizon the main scenarios under consideration include reduced water demand from improved water use efficiency in the urban and agriculture sector and investment in water supply infrastructure including inter basin infrastructure and dams a desalination plant and increased groundwater extraction our findings suggest that implementation of demand side management strategies which in this instance is investment in water use efficiency technology and water conservation measures result in more favourable net benefit outcomes than investment in water supply infrastructures the primary outcome of this study is to help the regional government of tacna peruvian water authorities and water users make more informed decisions about water investment options going forward thereby supporting regional development opportunities keywords drought desalination irrigation subsistence farming mining residential demand supply augmentation 1 introduction managing water resources in basins under semi permanent conditions of scarcity requires proactive management and infrastructure planning molden 2020 competing stakeholders and water users in semi arid basins usually show important power and resource asymmetries e g irrigation versus mining sectors thus triggering potential conflicts which further hinder the efforts to advance collaborative water governance and management galvez et al 2019 to address recurrent water crises and related conflicts peru has embarked on a water reform that included the establishment of a new water law and a new institutional framework for managing water resources roa garcia et al 2015 although peru has 4 2046 million cubic metres per year hereafter mcm year of the world s freshwater resources fao 2021 the hyper to semi arid pacific basin with only 2 of the country s water resources 37 mcm year concentrates most of peru s population 18 5 million out of 27 million and economic activity including irrigation and mining fao 2021 world bank 2013 peru s pacific basin is regarded as highly water stressed oki and quiocho 2020 and managing water resources from a supply perspective is challenging due to i rainfall and streamflow variability and seasonality rau et al 2019 ii prevailing dry conditions rau et al 2018 iii limited water storage and regulation infrastructure world bank 2013 and iv the ongoing overexploitation of groundwater in coastal aquifers salmoral et al 2020 schwarz and mathijs 2017 although the peruvian institutional reforms have enabled stakeholder participation through the creation of local water basin councils and local water administrators paerregaard et al 2016 conflicts among stakeholders over water use and proposed infrastructure projects are still common bebbington and williams 2008 sosa and zwarteveen 2016 in many instances knowledge about the pros and cons of water related projects and demand management measures and their impact on the supply system is not quantitatively assessed with a whole of basin perspective ana 2014a our research aims to help answer the question what are the benefits and costs of alternative water management scenarios it is important for water authorities and water users to understand the benefits and costs of each water demand and supply management decision to make the best investment decision going forward however to properly understand the impact of their decisions on future water availability and the welfare of each water user the analyses underpinning their decisions need to consider the hydrological inter dependencies across water basins the impact on all the water users involved and the uncertainty of the predicted outcome on their decisions without all of this water managers and water users maybe making decisions without a full set of information to make proper trade offs between catchments or trade offs between water users however previously published literature in the economic analysis of irrigation water demand and supply management often focusses on a single production scenario paoletti and shortridge 2020 therefore findings from these studies rarely provide useful insights in a situation where water supply is managed across multiple basins in a production scenario where there are multiple crop types under consideration the same argument applies to the economic analysis of urban water demand and supply in the urban sector often in urban water management studies residential water demand and supply management is considered in isolation of other competing water users such as the commercial industrial and agricultural sector worthington 2010 they therefore fail to capture how allocating water to the residential sector affects the welfare of other water users meanwhile in studies where multiple water users are considered the analysis is often limited to understanding and predicting water demand and supply balance only e g flörke et al 2018 as such these studies miss the economic analysis to quantify the benefits and costs to each of the water users for different management options additionally the outcome of a management decision is often subject to many sources of uncertainty including yield responses commodity prices supply system costs and water availability due to climate change yet previous research in irrigation agriculture rarely comprehensively considers these uncertainties paoletti and shortridge 2020 to overcome these research gaps and limitations our paper investigates hydrological inter dependencies across water basins benefits and costs to different water users and uncertainties around the outcome of each water management decision we present the results of an economic analysis that compares alternative water demand and supply management scenarios in peru when water is managed across multiple water catchments and when there are multiple water users involved the demand and supply management strategies include 1 the implementation of water use efficiency programs in the urban and agriculture sector aimed at reducing demand by 15 2 the augmentation of water supply for agriculture via increased groundwater pumping and inter basin water transfer and 3 the construction of a desalination plant to provide potable water supply to the urban area we analysed the benefits and costs to four main sectors in the region urban agriculture mining and the environment to account for uncertainty we applied a stochastic benefit cost analysis bca using monte carlo simulation to estimate the probabilistic benefits and costs for a series of proposed demand and supply management strategies the assessment is underpinned by a well calibrated water resources management model the model i adequately describes the hydrology of the caplina locumba basin ii includes operational agreements or protocols existing or potential for water sharing iii represents the current or foreseen operation of the existing or potential water infrastructure and iv describes demand management for example including improvements in water use efficiency for irrigation and urban water consumption 2 study area the caplina locumba basin 1 638 900 ha geographically located within the atacama desert is situated in the tacna region first tier administrative level at the southernmost part of the country and borders to the south with chile to the east with bolivia and to the west with the pacific ocean fig 1 the main urban centre is the city of tacna with a population of 358 218 inhabitants ogie 2019 the region is mostly arid and rainfall estimated from september to august for 1969 2004 changes across an altitudinal gradient with mean annual rainfall of less than 10 mm at the coast less than 50 mm in most parts of the basin about 20 mm in tacna and up to 500 mm in the foothills of the andean mountains lavado casimiro et al 2012 rainfall is highly seasonal occurring mostly during the austral summer months december to february the altitudinal gradient also defines the temperature with the annual average mean daily temperature in tacna being 20 c varying from 7 to 28 c and in the andean foothills being 3 c varying from 15 to 20 c the caplina locumba basin is a system of interconnected basins that regulate and convey water to areas of high demand through a series of dams canals and groundwater wells fig 1 a system of surface reservoirs and groundwater wellfields supply water to the city of tacna from the uchusuma maure basin in the andean uplands through a network of tunnels and canals the andean aquifer of el ayro supplements groundwater with about 16 39 mcm year and is jointly operated by the regional government of tacna and the water supply company entidad prestadora de servicios de saneamiento tacna sociedad anónima from here onwards referred to as eps tacna the key water users in the region include copper mining and irrigated agriculture in the rural parts of the region and industrial and urban water use in the vicinity of the city of tacna overall water demand in the tacna region is 677 mcm year based on the volume of allocated water licences while water supply averages only 381 mcm year ana 2014a a key factor in this deficit is the groundwater exploitation of the caplina coastal aquifer for irrigated agriculture in la yarada which amounts to 110 mcm year pino et al 2019 this aquifer is overexploited and currently groundwater discharge rates far exceed recharge rates pino et al 2019 resulting in increased salinity due to saltwater intrusion the proportion of water demand by each sector is 3 7 for urban residential 25 2 mcm year 7 for mining 47 2 mcm year 0 1 for commerce and industry 0 5 mcm year and 89 2 603 9 mcm year for irrigated agriculture ana 2014a despite irrigated agriculture being the largest water user the estimated contribution of this sector to the economic productivity of the tacna region is only 6 9 as compared to mining and commercial users with 17 8 and 14 6 respectively inei 2017 hence the irrigated agriculture sector is not considered a high value user of water however agriculture is an essential component of subsistence living in the region for an estimated one third of the farming population gill 2009 the caplina locumba basin also hosts the largest coastal wetlands in peru called ite bay wetlands fig 1 the ite bay wetlands are located at the mouth of the locumba river covering an area of 1180 ha these wetlands support a number of migratory birdlife and are home to 75 of the birdlife in the region maquera 2017 the wetlands also support the local subsistence farming community that rear goats sheep cattle and pigs within this national context the caplina locumba basin is facing increasing water demand to sustain economic activity and population growth in this region the steady growth in population and resulting economic activity inei 2009 has outpaced the implementation of infrastructure to harvest and manage the scarce water supplies in an already complex supply network further stressing the water system in addition the transboundary nature national and international of the water resources presents an additional practical and institutional challenge for the operators of the complex surface water supply network proyecto especial de tacna pet a unit of the regional government of tacna albrecht et al 2018 opportunities to mitigate water stress have been considered over the years by the local water basin council and other water users and several of these have been partially or fully implemented ana 2014b traditional farming and irrigation practices such as river diversion flood irrigation and terrace farming are used widely in the basin resulting in low irrigation efficiencies in the range 40 55 therefore investment in improved irrigation systems and agricultural practice would significantly reduce the demand for water from this sector while not compromising on the welfare and well being outcomes for these communities meanwhile in the urban sector water is still rationed through the city and many users do not have 24 7 access to potable water despite the existing supply treatment plant operating at full capacity radio uno 2020 the reason for this shortfall is because the current supply treatment plant does not produce enough potable water to meet existing demand additionally the distribution network still does not reach every household in the urban area construction of a desalination plant or an increased share of existing water allocations has the potential to provide urban users with the water they require but will also require an effective payment mechanism del saz salazar et al 2016 at the same time demand management strategies to reduce urban water demand at household and business level could help reduce inefficient use of water brooks 2006 there are also options to expand existing reservoirs to increase their water supply capacity these options could be done at a lower cost than the desalination plant 3 method the impacts of climate change and regional development from agricultural and population growth on the benefits and costs of water resources development in the caplina locumba basin were explored through a series of scenarios to capture the interdependencies among the basins water supply and demand were modelled using a water management model built with the ewater source integrated modelling platform https ewater org au products ewater source welsh et al 2013 the development of the model for the surface water system included the modelling of water supply and demand i rainfall runoff modelling ii river system modelling that includes the natural and anthropic physical characteristics reservoirs offtakes channels irrigation urban centres etc and iii management rules of operation of the water infrastructure surface and groundwater the model for the surface water system has been coupled to a groundwater numerical model of el ayro aquifer developed in modflow harbaugh et al 2000 the operation of both models has been verified by means of coherent and comparable values for key components of the water balance the model topology and its calibration results are described in the supplementary information section s 1 showing that the supply demand system is adequately represented in the model in terms of water availability and demand both in magnitude and temporal patterns climate change projections were implemented focusing on changes in precipitation temperature and potential evaporation across the caplina locumba basin change projections were obtained using empirical scale factors which reflect the change in the climate variables in the future 2046 2075 relative to current climate variables chiew et al 2009 this reference climate projection developed for all of peru is derived from the analysis of change signal in the cmip5 global climate models gcm used and analysed in the ipcc ar5 fifth assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change climate change projections were used to produce input data for the water management model to project the availability of water resources for a dry future these projections are described in the supplementary information section s 3 1 the methods to estimate population growth are based on a long term population growth rate of 2 which is in line with methods currently used in the peruvian national census inei 2009 with this method the estimated population in the city of tacna by 2026 is 429 708 inhabitants value that is used in the scenario analysis water availability to each end user in each catchment was then used as input into the bca to deal with uncertainty around the availability of water resources crop price mineral price crop yield multiplier from improved irrigation efficiency and water efficiency measure costs we applied a stochastic bca method to account for the uncertainty around the benefits and costs of water demand and supply planning scenarios specifically monte carlo simulations were used to estimate the probability that the benefits of demand management changing water supply allocation and water supply infrastructure investment would outweigh the costs for each of the scenarios under consideration the advantage of applying the stochastic bca is that we could examine the robustness of the net benefit outcome if the benefits and costs were to change paoletti and shortridge 2020 the software program used to perform the stochastic bca is called risk an add in to microsoft excel that permits the evaluation of stochastic benefit and cost outcomes using monte carlo simulations palisade 2016 output from risk will demonstrate the likelihood that a benefit will outweigh the costs given the uncertainty around various input variables decision makers can make more informed decisions around water management benefits and costs and the risks involved in making any of their decisions using this framework we applied a scenario analysis method to evaluate the benefits and costs of alternative water demand and supply management decisions under climate change and regional development these decisions include implementation of demand management activities to encourage water use efficiency changing water supply allocation availability to various users and water supply augmentation through the expansion of existing infrastructure or the investment in new infrastructure 3 1 scenario analysis several future water management scenarios for the tacna region were agreed with stakeholders through a consultation process consisting of a series of expert interviews and workshops see section 3 7 the scenarios were modelled to assess their benefits and costs against hydrologic and economic baseline conditions hereafter referred to as baseline scenario a these scenarios include various combinations of 1 a scenario where water use efficiency is put in place and there is no investment in new water infrastructure 2 a scenario where a desalination plant is constructed to provide a climate resilient source of water and 3 a scenario where groundwater pumping and inter basin transfers from the uchusuma maure basin are augmented these scenarios were representative of the key recommendations of previous investigations into water security for the region ana 2014a gore tacna 2013 aspects considered included the potential development of irrigated agriculture a population increase and an increase in water use efficiency satisfying future water demands will require new investments which will have an impact on magnitude and time of water availability the construction of dams inter basin transfers and or use of groundwater in order to satisfy future demand will have effects on the magnitude and seasonality of streamflow as well as on the sustainability of the aquifers in the case of new dams the operation destined to store water during the austral summer months rainy season december to february and the gradual discharge according to demand will modify the volume and seasonality of the flows in regimes that were previously poorly regulated on the other hand the modernization of irrigation and the improvement of multi sectoral efficiency will tend to reduce demand through a combination of structural and non structural measures the agreed scenarios examined in the bca are summarised in table 1 and further described below the catchments being considered are ilabaya locumba and uchusuma caplina note that the uchusuma caplina catchment connects the uchusuma maure and the caplina catchments through the canal uchusuma alto and other canals and tunnels as previously mentioned water supply and demand for a baseline scenario a were modelled with the water management model the water use efficiency scenario a was assessed for all the study area the water use efficiency scenario under historical a and dry b climate was assessed in the catchments of ilabaya and locumba by efficiency we assume an improvement in water use in irrigation of 15 by switching from traditional flood irrigation to drip irrigation and hence a reduction in water licence volumes the current irrigation efficiencies in the area are about 40 ana 2010 an irrigation efficiency of 55 has been achieved in projects with experience and tradition in irrigation in the andean area it is possible to improve efficiency with economical irrigation methods for example from 40 in gravity systems to 75 in sprinkler irrigation systems olarte hurtado and quispe vergara 2006 management of allocation through volumetric water controls have also increased efficiency in the large 1 000 000 ha coastal irrigation system in chancay lambayeque vos and vincent 2011 the assumption of 15 efficiency gain is also used for the urban sector in the urban sector achieving a 15 efficiency is possible with a combination of technology and behaviour change both in the residential and commercial sectors gregory and hall 2011 in this analysis we only focus on efficiency gains in the agricultural and urban sectors as their combined demand comprise more than 93 of total water demand in the region ana 2014a investment for desalination in scenario da could improve the security of water supply in the urban area of tacna however desalinating seawater can be costly the levelized cost of a desalination plant was estimated by sedapal servicios de agua potable y alcantarillado at around pen 1 800 000 per mcm macera 2018 here we analyse the benefits and costs of investment in a desalination plant for the two key water users in the uchusuma caplina catchment urban and agriculture it was assumed that all the water produced by the desalination plant will be used to meet urban demand i e all urban demand is met thus freeing up surface water for use by the agricultural sector meanwhile the urban sector will demand 15 less water than normal when compared to the baseline scenario because more efficient measures in the use of water are being implemented in the urban area of tacna therefore the water supplied to the agricultural sector increases while the water supply to the urban sector decreases in the inter basin augmentation aa scenario we examine the costs and benefits associated with expanding el ayro s wellfield capacity to 31 53 mcm year and investing in the inter basin transfer project vilavilani ii pet 2011 it should be taken into account that the expansion of el ayro to 31 53 mcm year occurs both in the baseline a and in the alternative scenario aa therefore the main difference in investment cost between these two scenarios comes from the cost of building vilavilani ii water supply and use in each of the scenarios will change according to the conditions described in table 1 including groundwater changes in el ayro aquifer water supply probability distributions from the water management model based on each scenario were used to estimate the benefit cost of each scenario relative to the baseline scenario the water supply for the scenarios was apportioned within the catchment domain to the different existing users be them population agriculture mining or wetlands 3 2 specification of economic benefits the net benefit for each scenario is composed of the revenue generated by each of the water users including farm income income from water sales and income from mining this study uses monetary values in peruvian nuevo sol or pen with a conversion factor of pen 1 usd 0 31 which was the exchange rate at the time the bca was conducted source www xe com 2018 3 2 1 farm income one of the key economic factors that will be directly affected by the change in the availability of water supply is the agricultural sector the agricultural sector uses approximately 89 2 of the total water supply in tacna ana 2014a recovering water from this sector will increase the availability of water supply to other users however in doing so we must consider the possible loss of agricultural income due to lower water supply availability in this analysis we assume that the agricultural baseline income has the following specification 1 farm revenue pen j 1 j pc j rc j sc j where pc j is the farm gate price of crop j pen tonne rc j is the yield of crop j tonnes ha and sc j is the area of crop j ha note that 2 sc j dc de j where de j is the water demand of crop j m3 ha and dc is the availability of water m3 ha to the agricultural sector if the availability of water per hectare is less than the average crop water demand we assume that farmers will have to reduce the number of hectares of land to grow their produce and as a result reduce the total yield and farm income for that year historical data on crop area by type of crop for the period of 2001 2015 and monthly production of agricultural produce for the period of 2001 2015 were used to estimate the average minimum and maximum values and standard deviation of total crop yield by crop type per hectare per year documents from the ministry of agriculture of peru on the agroclimatic conditions for key crops provided information on the demand for water by type of crop for each of the three hydrographic basins in tacna see table s 3 in the supplementary information for estimated water demand mcm ha by crop type the data on farmgate price for key crops were obtained from values tabulated in dra tacna 2015 during the period 2010 2015 the price of crops fluctuated significantly to account for the uncertainty around farmgate prices we performed a distribution fit in risk palisade 2016 to fit a distribution on the price variable rather than use a constant price for each crop the supplementary information table s 4 shows the distribution of farmgate price by crop type constructed based on farmgate price information during the period 2001 2015 for each catchment we selected three crops with the highest water allocations as the three main crops for calculating agriculture revenue this is to simplify the agriculture revenue calculation in consultation with experts in the tacna region table s 5 in the supplementary information provides a summary of the three main crops and the share of agriculture water use for each catchment 3 2 2 agricultural water use efficiency it was assumed in this analysis that the introduction of water efficiency measures in the agriculture sector is a result of 15 of allocation being cut to this sector hence farmers have no choice but to improve their productivity with the same amount of water as a result we assume that farmers switch from traditional flood irrigation with an open channel distribution system to a pressurized drip irrigation system the benefits of switching to a pressurized drip irrigation system is improved water use efficiency and productivity playan and mateos 2006 demonstrated that the benefit of changing irrigation system from surface to sprinkler in field crops such as maize is twofold 1 a significant reduction in irrigation water demand roughly from 12 000 to 7000 m3 ha and 2 a 20 increase in crop yield typically from 10 000 to 12 000 kg ha to capture improve productivity because of switching to a pressurized drip irrigation system in scenarios where water use efficiency is introduced we multiplied crop yield by a stochastic factor that ranges between 1 and 1 2 following a beta distribution note that water saved from water use efficiency will be allocated downstream and the benefits of that additional water will be captured in other catchments 3 2 3 urban water sales revenue the change in water supply to the urban sector will have an impact on the income of the service provider eps tacna since the rates are based on the volume of water consumed by users in this analysis the basic income for the service provider is calculated using the following formula 3 water sales revenue pen pa s ua s where pa s is the price of urban water by sector s pen m3 and ua s is the water use m3 by sector s based on tacna water billing information extracted from the eps tacna reports on water consumption by category 2001 2015 we estimated the average minimum maximum and standard deviation of the price of urban water for each sector including domestic commercial industrial state and social the figures shown in table 2 were used as input parameters to estimate income from urban water sales for this analysis the consumer price index was used to adjust these average prices to the 2017 2018 values using the same data set basic water consumption for each sector was also established according to these figures it is evident that domestic water use is the highest in the urban sector consuming around 76 of the total water supply 3 2 4 urban water use efficiency it was assumed in this analysis that the introduction of water efficiency measures in the urban sector will lead to a 15 water savings across all five types of urban water users hence 15 less water will be allocated to the urban sector in the case of tacna 15 of water saved in the urban sector will be transferred to the agriculture sector and the benefits of such savings will be accrued by growers in that region in other catchments water saved from the urban sector will be transferred to downstream catchments where users will realize the benefit of extra water availability 3 2 5 revenue from mining ana 2014a provides the basic water demand for the mining sector on the amount of water consumed by the mining company southern peru copper corporation spcc per year according to the report spcc requires 51 mcm year 20 mcm year of groundwater from the suches vizcachas aquifer and 31 mcm year of surface water from the callazas tacalaya and cinto rivers an increase or decrease in the amount of water supply available to the mining sector will have an impact on mining revenue from this analysis we specified mining revenue from water use as 5 mining revenue pen p m r m where p m is the price of the mineral m pen tonnes and r m is the yield of the mineral m tonnes year note that 6 r m dm de m where de m is the demand for mining water m m3 year and dm is the availability of water m3 year to the mining sector production level of copper and molybdenum during 2012 2106 were sourced from southern copper 2016 the main mineral mined in the tacna region is copper followed by molybdenum zinc gold and silver in this analysis we focused only one two types of minerals copper and molybdenum since the combined output of these two minerals are nearly 99 of minerals mined in the tacna region table 3 provides a summary of the proportion of minerals mined water use to mine each mineral and the average market price per tonne the market price of copper and molybdenum during 2012 2016 came from www iwgcopper com and www metalary com respectively price of copper was validated against the price of copper as reported in southern copper 2016 as the price of copper and molybdenum are exogenous factors and controlled by world market prices we captured price uncertainty by representing price in the analysis as a distribution rather than a fixed value the distributions reported in table 3 are based on usd values we used a conversion factor of pen 1 usd 0 31 source www xe com 2018 to convert copper and molybdenum prices to pen 3 3 specification of costs the cost of water management decision making consists of three major components 1 the cost of investment in new infrastructure including the cost of upgrading or expanding old infrastructure 2 the cost of implementing demand management measures or water efficiency measures to reduce water consumption and 3 the cost of wetland loss if not enough water is sent downstream to service ite bay wetlands 3 3 1 cost of infrastructure investment there are several infrastructure investment options under consideration by the national and the regional government of tacna we assumed that the cost in the baseline scenario a was pen 0 because there were no changes to management practices nor infrastructure expansion a list of investment options and the details of each option are presented in table 4 cost estimates for options 1 5 and 7 were retrieved from previously conducted feasibility analyses pet 2009a 2009b 2011 2014 2015 2016 for the desalination plant option 6 we used the cost estimate by sedapal as reported in macera 2018 according to sedapal converting a cubic meter of seawater to fresh water would require a cost of pen 1 80 note that the investment costs for callazas dam is represented as a distribution rather than a fixed value due to uncertainties around the cost estimates all investment costs were converted to a levelized cost which represents the lifetime cost of the technology average per mcm this method accounts for the full capital including replacement costs and operating costs of a project over its life period by converting all investment costs to levelized costs we can compare the net present value benefits of alternative investment projects with different scales of operations investment and operating periods or both cooley and phurisamban 2016 the levelized cost function is specified as 7 levelized cost of water pen year cc frc om r capacity where cc is capital cost frc is capital recovery factor om is annual operation and maintenance cost r is replacement cost capacity is the total capacity of the infrastructure the frc is specified as 8 frc r 1 r n 1 r n 1 where n useful life in years and r discount rate 3 3 2 cost of implementing urban water use efficiency there are costs to eps tacna for implementing water use efficiency programs the assumptions used for estimating the cost to enhance urban water use efficiency is based on the levelized cost of implementing water use efficiency programs in australia such as shower head change control of leakage and industrial and commercial audit activities we based these cost estimates on australian figures as we currently do not have the levelized cost of implementing a water use efficiency program in tacna but do have access to detailed data from equivalent programmes in australia also the cost estimates from australia include the cost of implementing water use efficiency to the residential and commercial sector table s 6 in the supplementary information provides levelized cost estimates for implementing each of the 15 water use efficiency programs given that these numbers were from australia we introduced the cost of implementing urban water use efficiency measures as a distribution rather than a fixed value to capture the uncertainty around the cost of this variable 3 3 3 cost of implementing agricultural water use efficiency we assumed that farmers switch from traditional flood irrigation with an open channel distribution system to a pressurized drip irrigation system the cost of switching to a pressurized drip irrigation system was based on calculations for pressurised drip irrigation systems where 1800 ha of crops with pressurized irrigation will be delivered into ite and had an investment of pen 12 9 million sin fronteras 2017 in this analysis we assumed that the installation of a pressurized drip irrigation system would lead to 15 reduction in water use in agriculture overall the average cost used to estimate the cost of achieving water use efficiency in agriculture is pen 7167 per hectare the number of hectares is based on the same number of hectares used to calculate the agriculture revenue for each catchment and scenario 3 3 4 loss of environmental value due to limited information on the value of environmental assets and ecosystem services in the tacna region in this analysis we only evaluated the impact of water supply shortages to the ite bay wetlands in the baseline scenario a we assume that these wetlands are maintained at a status quo ecological level if the amount of water reaches or exceeds a reference amount the environmental value of the wetland is maintained we assume that the wetland only uses the amount of water it needs to maintain the status quo and releases the excess into the ocean in the alternative scenario a and b the possibility of reduced water availability will result in a reduction of the area of the wetland and therefore the total value to the environment decreases the assumption is that reduced surface water flow to the wetlands due to excessive water use upstream will result in a reduction in the size of the wetland ha which in turn leads to a reduction in the ecosystem services value of the ite bay wetlands the reduction in the environmental value is calculated based on the use and non use values maquera 2017 estimated the total use value to be pen 277 218 and the non use value to be pen 3045 hence the total economic value of the wetland was pen 280 263 according to the analysis by maquera 2017 the total ecosystem value of the ite bay wetlands is usd 71 97 ha year given the size of the wetlands the total economic value of the wetland was estimated to be 9 total ecosystem value usd year value per hectare x total area of wetland 1 180 ha usd 71 97 ha year usd 84 924 6 year given these estimates and calculations the average cost of wetland loss in the alternative scenario is assumed to be pen 237 51 ha year 3 4 net benefit specification the merit of each water management option was assessed using the bca framework and expressed in terms of the net present value of the net benefit the objective is to choose the option that provides the higher or highest net benefit value the net present value of the net benefit function is expressed as 10 npv i t 0 t tb i t 1 r t t 0 t tc i t 1 r t where npv i is the net present value i e the total benefit tb minus the total cost tc of option i t is the time horizon of the alternative which is expressed in years t t 0 1 t and r is the discount rate the time horizon t is included to account for the fact that benefits and costs may occur at different times 3 5 other specifications and assumptions the time horizon of the analysis is 30 years for the period 2018 2047 the discount rate r is represented as a stochastic variable that follows a general beta distribution α1 2 α2 2 min 0 063 max 0 077 we assume no investment cost in the mining sector in response to water allocation cuts under water use efficiency scenarios and that the only cost to this water user comes from the loss in revenue due to reduced water availability for production 3 6 sensitivity analysis the robustness of the benefit cost outcome in this analysis is checked against changes to climate conditions we carried out a sensitivity analysis under the assumption of historical climate versus a drying climate as described in the supplementary information s 3 1 other uncertainties in key parameter values used to calculate the costs and benefits of each scenario are captured via the stochastic input variables 3 7 stakeholder consultation we performed stakeholder consultation processes in the form of personal interviews and three workshops with experts and decision makers to ensure that the details of the hydrological and economic models were as realistic and suitable for supporting decision making as best as possible therefore stakeholders were consulted before during and after the hydrological and economic models were performed the first workshop was conducted with the objective to arrive at an agreed upon set of parameter values data sources assumptions and variables of interest for sensitivity analysis we then conducted a second workshop to present the progress of the hydrological and economic models to ensure that the models were correctly calibrated and to discuss any issues that need to be overcome the third and final workshop was conducted to validate the findings from the hydrological and economic models the stakeholders involved in these processes include decision makers and experts from the regional government of tacna the national water authority autoridad nacional del agua ana eps tacna southern peru copper corporation and jorge basadre grohmann national university 4 results this section presents results from a selection of benefit cost scenario analysis to evaluate the differences between benefits and costs to the tacna region from implementing various water management scenarios against the baseline scenario a the scenarios being examined in the benefit cost analyses are baseline water use a water use efficiency under historical climate a water use efficiency under dry climate b desalination da and inter basin augmentation aa see table 1 for scenario description the sub catchments within the caplina locumba basin being considered for scenario assessment are ilabaya locumba and uchusuma caplina hydrological outputs used for estimating the costs and benefits of each scenario are based on distributions from the hydrological modelling for reference table 5 summarises the mean value of the quantity of water to each user under each scenario that is used in the benefit cost analysis 4 1 water use efficiency in ilabaya catchment under normal and dry climate we conducted a bca for the ilabaya catchment to evaluate the benefit and cost outcomes of introducing water use efficiency measures there are three main water users in this catchment agriculture mining and urban table 6 shows the changes in benefits and costs for scenarios a and b relative to the baseline scenario a notice that the cost under the baseline scenario a is pen 0 as no water demand nor supply management actions were taken in scenario b the benefit is reduced because water allocation has been reduced to each user by 15 and the cost is accrued to agriculture and urban users as they are required to cope with reduced water supply by implementing water use efficiency measures as previously mention the cost of investing in water efficient technology in the mining sector is beyond the scope of this analysis note that a 15 reduction in water allocation to the urban and mining sectors translates directly into a 15 reduction in revenue to the urban water service provider and the mining company however the agriculture sector suffers less revenue reduction only a 2 reduction because we assumed that the agriculture sector was able to improve productivity by replacing traditional irrigation methods with a pressurized drip irrigation system however the cost to the agriculture sector for investing in a pressurized drip irrigation system is larger than the cost to the urban sector for implementing water efficient measures see scenario a the cost to both sectors becomes lower when the climate is dry see scenario b the reason the cost of implementing water use efficiency under a drying climate scenario is lower is because water is made available to fewer end users in the region therefore less investment is required to build more infrastructure or invest in water use efficiency measures the key finding from this analysis is that the alternative scenarios a and b present a net benefit outcome that is lower than that of the baseline scenario a the main reason is because the cost of having to invest in irrigation infrastructure or water use efficiency measures outweigh the benefits accrued fig 2 present a probability density function of the expected benefit that is accrued from the baseline scenario a in comparison to scenario a and scenario b note that the expected net benefit distribution of scenario b sits slightly more to the left of the distribution of scenario a than a indicating a lower expected benefit from scenario b in comparison to the other two scenarios 4 2 water use efficiency in locumba catchment under normal and dry climate the locumba catchment is downstream of the ilabaya catchment when water use efficiency is introduced in the ilabaya catchment more water is made available downstream in the locumba catchment we present findings from the bca of scenarios a a and b in the locumba catchment there are four main water users in this catchment agriculture environment urban and mining the environment in this case are the wetlands in ite results from the bca is presented in table 7 in the locumba catchment the cost of implementing water use efficiency measures in the agricultural and urban sector is pen 250 280 million the outcome of introducing water use efficiency is a reduction in the expected benefit of around pen 330 360 million relative to the baseline scenario a note that although more water is flowing downstream towards the ite wetlands in scenario a the amount of water is greater than what is required to maintain the status quo condition of the wetlands hence the water is assumed to flow out the river mouth into the ocean and thus there is no further wetland loss it is very likely that there will be benefits to the marine ecosystem from more water flowing into the ocean however the appraisal of the benefits and costs for the marine ecosystems is beyond the scope of this analysis fig 3 provides a visual representation of the differences in the expected benefit of the three scenarios the expected benefit distribution of scenario a and b sit to the left of the distribution of scenario a indicating a lower expected net benefit from scenario a and b as compared to the baseline however there is very little difference in net benefit between scenario a and b 4 3 infrastructure investment in uchusuma caplina catchment three types of infrastructure investment are being considered in this catchment 1 extracting more water from el ayro aquifer 2 construction of a desalination plant and 3 construction of the vilavilani ii inter basin infrastructure the baseline scenario examines the net benefit of investing only in the expansion of el ayro aquifer to extract more water up to 31 53 mcm year scenario a this is contrasted against scenario da where the city constructs a desalination plant and around 15 mcm year of water from the desalination plant is supplied to the urban sector in addition to the existing 1 5 mcm year from surface water the third scenario is examining the net benefit of the expansion of el ayro aquifer to extract more water and the construction of the vilavilani ii infrastructure the new vilavilani ii infrastructure will provide another 33 89 mcm year 4 3 1 desalination for urban water use investment in desalination for water use in cities could improve the security of water supply in the urban area of tacna in the future the desalination plant will meet the urban water sector demand which has been in deficit all these years however desalinating seawater has a cost the levelized cost of a desalination plant was estimated by sedapal macera 2018 at around pen 1 8 million per mcm the benefits and costs of investing in a desalination plant were analysed for the two key users of water in the uchusuma caplina basin namely urban and agriculture the assumption is that all the water produced by the desalination plant will be used to satisfy urban demand as such some surface water can be freed up and given to the agricultural sector meanwhile the urban sector will demand 15 less water compared to the baseline because water use efficiency measures are being implemented in the urban area of tacna therefore in this analysis the water supplied to the agricultural sector increases while water supply to the urban sector decreases i e the urban sector uses water from the desalination plant instead table 8 provides a summary of the benefits and costs of these three scenarios fig 4 shows a comparison between the expected benefit distribution from scenario da and aa as compared to the baseline a the distribution shows the expected net benefit of scenario da and aa are both less than the expected benefit of scenario a and that scenario aa shows more variation in the net benefit outcome than the other two scenarios despite benefits gained from being able to increase agriculture activity the cost of sourcing water from desalination is substantial pen 348 million once combined with the cost of implementing urban water use efficiency of pen 19 million the total cost of scenario da outweighs the benefits one option to reduce the large discrepancy between the cost and benefit is for the urban water service provider to charge more for water produced by the desalination plant in countries like australia the price of potable water supplied to the household is calculated to be at least equal to the long term marginal cost of the portfolio of water infrastructure hence the water utility is not running its operation at a loss 4 3 2 vilavilani ii inter basin infrastructure in this scenario we examine the costs and benefits of expanding the capacity of el ayro aquifer to 31 53 mcm year and investing in the vilavilani ii inter basin infrastructure 33 89 mcm year the scenarios under consideration are a and aa note that the expansion of el ayro to 31 53 mcm year occurs both in the baseline a and the alternative scenario aa therefore the main difference in the investment cost between these two scenarios stem from the cost of constructing vilavilani ii since we are examining the impact of this water management strategy in uchusuma caplina only two water users are considered urban and agriculture table 8 shows the expected benefits and costs of implementing scenario aa the net benefit accrued from expanding el ayro and investing in vilavilani ii is substantially lower than the baseline this stems from a significant investment in water supply infrastructure to both urban and agriculture water users hence the investment in el ayro expansion and vilavilani ii will not result in a favourable economic outcome fig 4 demonstrates the magnitude of the expected net benefit from scenario aa relative to the baseline scenario a and da scenario aa is more favourable than scenario da but both offer negative net benefits 5 discussion we performed a stochastic bca of multiple water demand and supply management scenarios in the catchments of ilabaya locumba and uchusuma caplina examining how the four different types of water users urban agriculture mining and the environment are impacted under each scenario given the connectedness nature of water supply in the tacna region a change in water management strategy in an upstream catchment could create significant economic and environmental change to the corrresponding downstream catchment for this reason it was important for the hydrological model to account for the inter dependencies between the catchments and the impact any change in water demand and supply management practices may have on water availability as a result we were also able to quantify the change to the multiple water users in each of the catchments this type of modelling is often lacking in the current literature as previously discussed given the hydrological inter dependencies between different catchments our hydrological model was able to represent how water conservation measures in the ilabaya catchment translated to more water made available downstream in the locumba catchment as a result of water efficiency measures in the agriculture and urban sector in both the ilabaya catchment and locumba catchments more water was made available to flow through to the ite wetlands resulting in zero loss to the wetlands however this of course comes at a cost to those who were involved in the introduction of water conservation measures given the uncertainty in water availability crop price crop yield and supply system costs we demonstrated that although two management scenarios may produce similar benefit cost outcomes i e expected net benefit one scenario is may still be less favourable than the other due to the uncertainty of the expected outcome i e larger standard deviation without incorporating stochasticity in the analysis we may conclude that the expected outcomes of these two management strategies are the same when in fact they are quite different therefore the application of the stochastic bca framework enables policy makers to make more informed decisions around water management benefits and costs and the risks involved in order to make the trade offs that suits their strategic direction our results suggest that water use efficiency programs in both the urban and agriculture sector offer positive net benefits albeit lesser net benefit than the status quo this analysis may change if we include the dollar benefit of increased water supply certainty to all the water users however the dollar benefit of water supply reliability difficult to measure and risk based approaches are often recommended instead black et al 2015 the bca reveals that the price of water plays an important role in influencing the outcome if water were to be priced based on the long run marginal cost of the water supply technology or priced based on how scarce it is then the benefit estimates will improve having said that scarcity pricing zetland 2021 should only be implemented once we can ensure that all basic water needs are met it must be emphasized that social equity comes first and that the objective of scarcity pricing is not to price low income people out of their rights to have access to water required for living the decision to implement water efficiency measures is a good one however if the cost of implementing other non technology related options is available at a lower cost those options should be implemented first suggestions include the use of nudges i e normative messaging to encourage people to use less water or compliance normative enforcement and optimised monitoring to facilitate sustainable management castilla rho et al 2019 in australia a set of information on residential water bill to show how a household is consuming water relative to other households of the same number of occupants have been shown to reduce household water consumption see fielding et al 2013 following this method households did not have to buy any new technology and still show reduction in per capita consumption as mentioned in the methodology section there are a number of assumptions that underpin these results and we have tried to best capture the uncertainties where there is lack of concrete information by introducing uncertainties into the analyses for this reason our benefit and cost estimates can be represented by a probability density function rather than one fixed value there are some limitations to this analysis that we would like to point out so that more information could be collected in the future to improve upon the benefit cost analysis firstly for each catchment we selected three crops with the highest water allocations as the three main crops for calculating agriculture revenue this is to simplify the agriculture revenue calculation in the future more crops should be added the value of small scale farming such as subsistence living llama farms in the northern parts of the region should also be included in future analyses note that particular for farming for subsistence living the benefit is beyond a commercial one there are also benefits associated with quality of life as well as cultural and heritage values that should also be considered secondly we do not have information on the cost of applying water use efficiency measures in the urban sector for tacna hence we had to use cost data from australia in the future an analysis of the cost of implanting water use efficiency measures should be conducted specifically for tacna thirdly we assumed an average cost of applying water use efficiency measures in tacna based on the average value of installing pressurized drip irrigation in ite in the future the cost of applying water use efficiency in agriculture should be based on the location of the investment and the type of water efficient measure being implemented fourthly we assumed that the benefit and cost adjustment to changes in water allocations is linear and instantaneously future analysis could be improved by including non linear and lag effects of reduced water allocation to each of the water users differently lastly we did not calculate the cost or benefit of 15 water use efficiency for mining as we do not have sufficient data to estimate neither the costs nor the benefits we therefore acknowledge the multi sectorial analysis presented in this work represents a conservative benefit cost appraisal as opportunities for improved water efficiency measures through implementation of suitable technologies in the mining sector are unexplored there are a number of economic benefits not included in this analysis that could substantially change the outcome of some of these scenarios these benefits include the benefits of increased ecosystem services from more water going to wetlands rivers and marine ecosystems surface water and groundwater dependent ecosystems have been shown to have both economic and environmental values in australia see e g tapsuwan et al 2010 tapsuwan and polyakov 2016 tapsuwan et al 2015 the value of environmental assets and its ecosystem services should be evaluated in order to improve the accuracy of the costs and benefits of allocating water for the environment tourism values if environmental conditions improve could increase significantly along with other types of ecosystem services including provisioning regulating supporting and other cultural services there are also social and health physical and mental benefits from water supply security to all users that were not accounted in this analysis such as job security income security quality of life sanitation and overall happiness and well being we therefore encourage future research into these following areas environmental and social values of water agua 2008 6 conclusion managing water demand and supply in an arid region is a complex and difficult problem especially when water supply flows across multiple water catchments and when there are many water users involved the problem becomes even more complicated when there is uncertainty around water supply availability from year to year due to climate change and constant changes in economic factors such as crop price there are also benefits and costs that have no market value such as the economic impact to the environment in the form of shadow prices without applying a robust economic analysis to the problem not all the pros and cons of each water management decision could be carefully considered possibly leading water managers to make management decisions that lead to an overall lower societal welfare this paper presents a stochastic bca that was able to capture some of the complexity and uncertainty in water demand and supply management findings from this paper not only fill in the gap in the current water management literature but also help the regional government of tacna peruvian water authorities and water users make more informed decisions about

9588,the lack of coupled surface subsurface flow models applied in lowland rice irrigation systems is the prime mover for this research this study aimed to develop a coupled model that can capture the soil water dynamics in paddy rice fields and to calibrate and validate the model using actual field data to serve as basis for irrigation water management using alternate wetting and drying awd for lowland rice production systems the zero inertia surface flow model was internally coupled with the richards based subsurface flow model through python scripts boundary conditions were set accordingly based on lowland rice field scenarios irrigation advance times were observed manually while field water recession data were collected using wireless sensors model calibration showed acceptable results for the surface flow r 2 0 99 se 0 97 rmse 3 14 min and subsurface flow r 2 0 71 nse 0 60 mse 8 78 mm sd 5 51 mm ae 7 51 mm domains likewise model validation yielded acceptable results for surface flow r 2 0 98 nse 0 88 rmse 6 12 min and subsurface flow r 2 0 76 nse 0 60 rmse 10 87 mm sd 7 91 mm ae 8 28 mm respectively results also showed the model s capability to simulate water level fluctuations in awd irrigated rice fields during the wet and dry seasons under various rainfall scenarios model projections showed the need for awd irrigation practice when the normal rainfall had been reduced by 75 during the wet season dry season simulations indicated the need for awd under all rainfall scenarios simulation results have further unveiled the importance of the plow pan characteristics in influencing the soil water flow behavior this study was also able to address the limitations of the existing coupled models that could not meet the boundary conditions of paddy rice field settings ultimately the model developed in this study could serve as basis for the development of optimum irrigation operation schemes in awd irrigated rice fields graphical abstract ga1 keywords coupled surface subsurface flow model soil water dynamics irrigation water management alternate wetting and drying lowland rice model simulation 1 introduction basin irrigation of lowland

alternative water management practices have been developed bouman et al 2007 these practices include alternate wetting and drying awd irrigation which is a form of irrigation management wherein the field water level is allowed to decline down to a safe water level threshold below the ground surface before triggering another irrigation event this results to less water use and a longer irrigation interval as compared to usual irrigation practices past studies have demonstrated the benefits of awd among the most notable and highly cited studies include that of lampayan et al 2015 which provided empirical evidence that awd could lead to huge water savings without significantly affecting grain yield an alternative to direct measurements and monitoring of water level fluctuations in awd irrigated rice fields is through the use of water balance models in simulating the soil water dynamics of basin irrigation system one can opt to use traditional surface irrigation simulation programs or soil water hydrologic modeling platforms depending upon the goal of the study in the traditional surface irrigation models the surface water flow is described based on mathematical equations of continuity and momentum it gives more emphasis on the details of the horizontal water movement above the soil surface and also models the vertical soil water movement in an overly simplified manner by considering the infiltration values as mere representation of the subsurface flow on the contrary the existing soil water hydrologic modeling platforms simulate the soil water movement in an explicit detail but lacks the capability in covering the surface water flow in basin irrigation setting between the two methods of simulation the use of soil water hydrologic modeling platforms is the most widely used for basin irrigation under awd as suggested in various literature e g tan et al 2013 li et al 2017 darzi naftchali et al 2017 among others most investigators of awd irrigation look more upon the crop water use efficiency and the effect of drying cycles on the rice crop welfare and that evaluating the basin irrigation performance under awd in the context of surface irrigation modeling is somewhat rare nevertheless the use of mathematical models in surface flow hydraulics play an important role in system irrigation design management and evaluation however there are certain limitations on the application of traditional surface flow models in awd irrigated basin traditional surface irrigation models operate on the assumption that the entire amount of irrigation volume that goes inside the field is the same volume that infiltrates and percolates into the soil profile thus eliminating the effect of crop factors and climatic variables in influencing the changes in field water level or the soil moisture in general this assumption is not applicable in basin irrigation system especially when considering the presence of plow pan layer that causes the surface water to stagnate for a long time thus giving the crop evapotranspiration to comprise its fine share of influence in field water recession another limitation of traditional surface irrigation models is its use of empirical infiltration functions such as lewis kostiakov and its variants like mecenzev model zerihun et al 2005 the parameters of the said infiltration functions are event specific and cannot account for the initial soil moisture content more so cover the soil moisture redistribution through time another limitation is its assumption on the homogeneity of the soil structure along its depth thus completely neglecting the importance of plow pan in paddy rice fields and its effect on soil water dynamics these limitations of the surface flow models can be addressed by physically based soil water flow models however they lack the capability in simulating the surface flow dynamics that fit the basin irrigation setting which can be key figures in irrigation duration decisions and irrigation performance evaluations many researchers have recognized the shortcoming of using the traditional surface irrigation models alone and tried to address the problem by combining surface flow irrigation model with soil water flow model schmitz et al 1985 tabuada et al 1995 wohling et al 2004 zerihun et al 2005 bautista et al 2010 banti et al 2011 among others some even tried to couple a crop model to a previously coupled surface subsurface flow model wohling and mailhol 2007 wohling and schmitz 2007 apparently most of these studies are only applicable in furrow irrigation systems zerihun et al 2005 also developed a coupled surface subsurface flow model for the basin irrigation in lemon tree orchard while the coupled model of bautista et al 2010 was prototyped in borders and basins although applied in basin irrigation the boundary conditions used in their models cannot meet the requirements of the paddy rice field setting to date no studies have yet applied a coupled surface subsurface flow model in basin irrigation with rice based cropping systems let alone the ones under awd irrigation regime where prediction of the field water recession up to the safe awd threshold is crucial this study aimed to develop a coupled model consisting of a surface flow model for the estimation of the irrigation advance and a vertical soil water flow model for the estimation of irrigation recession along with the other water balance components in awd irrigated basin which could serve as basis for developing efficient irrigation water management schemes 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description this study was performed at the lowland pilot test site of the pcari wiseir project located in brgy san roque victoria laguna with coordinates of 14 13 13 51 n and 121 19 11 94 e the study area has a highly intensive production of rice regularly cultivated during the wet and dry cropping season respectively a tropical climate system prevails in the area with significant rainfall during most of the months usually between may to december and with a relatively short dry period usually between january to april on the average the site receives an annual precipitation of 2084 mm and experiences an ambient temperature of 27 1 c maximum precipitation occurs during the month of july 279 mm while the driest month occurs in february with a rainfall depth averaging to 29 mm climate data org 2018 almost all of the rice fields in the vicinity of the site are not serviced by the national irrigation administration nia because it is situated at the downstream end of existing irrigation systems hence a shallow tube well stw is used to irrigate the crop production area owing to the presence of a highly productive shallow aquifer reducing fuel cost in pumping groundwater for irrigation provides a compelling incentive for the farmers in the area to employ alternate wetting and drying awd irrigation technique during the dry cropping season 2 2 model development 2 2 1 surface flow model the surface flow model is based on the analytical solution of the zero inertia zi equations of schmitz and seus 1990 the model assumes a moving momentum representative cross section in the water body and accounts for the time varying character of infiltration the model also offers no restriction on the use of different infiltration formula which makes it flexible in coupling with a subsurface flow model since the influence of the infiltration process on the momentum is accounted for the governing equations for the zi model are read as schmitz and seus 1990 1 a t u x a a τ u q 2 y x s o u 2 k 2 r 4 3 qu ga where x is the horizontal distance t is the elapsed time y x t is surface flow depth u x t is the surface flow velocity a x t is the flow cross sectional area q x t is the infiltration rate r is the hydraulic radius g is the gravitational constant and k 1 n in which n is the manning roughness coefficient multiplying both sides of the momentum equation with r 4 3 and assuming that the momentum can be continuously represented by the momentum at the center of the water body x thus substituting for a u q and r a t a x t t u t u x t t q t q x t t r t r x t t leads to the equation 3 r 4 3 y a a x u t k 2 s o q t g u t a t r t 4 3 the analytical solution of schmitz and seus 1990 yields the following set of equations for a x t and a o t 4 x t a o t 1 x x tip α 5 a o t x tip c 1 α u t k 2 s o q t u t g a t r t 4 3 α where c 1 and α are geometric coefficients of the flow cross section x tip is the location of the advancing water front and a o t is equal to a 0 t it is worth noting that a t and r t are implicitly dependent on a o t the derivation of its implicit iteration relation form is shown in the paper of schmitz and seus 1990 subsequently by employing a x t to the continuity equation leads to the equation for the flow velocity u x t read as 6 u x t u tip t u tip t u o t 0 x tip q x t dx a o t 1 x x tip x x tip q x t dx a x t for the determination of the center of gravity x t and x tip the following equations are used 7 x t x tip α 2 8 x tip α 1 a o t v in t v inf t where v in t is the volume of water supplied in the field and v inf t is the volume of water infiltrated in the field calculated as 9 v inf t 0 t 0 x tip q x t dtdx the value of v inf t is computed by the subsurface model cf the section entitled subsurface flow model schmitz and seus 1990 have provided the table of equations sequentially arranged for the iterative computation of the advance phase the sets of equations were derived for rectangular borders and basins with α 3 7 basin width b y and r y 2 2 1 1 surface flow upstream boundary conditions for simplification it was assumed in the model that inflow fluctuations at the start of an irrigation event is negligible and that a constant discharge is achieved right away this leads to the simplification of v in t 0 t q 0 t d t to be equal to q 0 t for the initial condition the following are assumed 10 x tip t 0 0 11 q x 0 t q 0 t 12 a x tip t 0 13 u x tip t u tip t 2 2 1 2 surface flow downstream boundary conditions at the end of the advance phase the boundary condition at the downstream end would be an impermeable dike thus no surface runoff will be incurred outside the basin the solution of schmitz and seus 1990 is only applicable during the advance phase thus a simple volume balance calculation was employed when the advancing front had reached downstream dike this assumption leads to the surface flow cross section to be dependent on the inflow volume and infiltrated volume it is mathematically expressed as 14 a o t v in t v inf t l where l is the basin length the computation of the irrigation cutoff time was based on target irrigation depth expressed in the equation form 15 t cutoff t l t req where t cutoff is the cutoff time t l is the irrigation advance time at the end of the field and t req is the required intake opportunity time and can be determined by querying the program about the time when the last node in the simulation field is fully saturated with water when the irrigation is cutoff discharge at the inlet will have zero flow the final surface water depth right after cutoff was computed based on a o t and the field water recession at any point along the field was predicted based on the subsurface flow model 2 2 2 subsurface flow model 2 2 2 1 ponded phase since the soil surface in the rice field is relatively flat and that paddy bunds are sealed with plastic lining one dimensional vertical water movement was assumed in this study in this regard lateral subsurface flow such as seepage was neglected which leaves soil water fluxes along the soil column be described using the richards equation combined with a sink term shown below 16 θ t z k θ ϕ z 1 s h t where θ is the volumetric soil water content ϕ is the hydraulic head t is the time z is the elevation k is the saturated hydraulic conductivity and s is the sink term for root water uptake the hydraulic head ϕ for porous media is commonly defined as 17 ϕ tot z ϕ m θ p ϕ o where ϕ tot is the total dynamic head z is the elevation or the gravitational potential ϕ m θ is the matric potential as a function of soil moisture p is the hydrostatic pressure and ϕ o is the osmotic potential but in the model it was assumed that water flow due to thermal gradients and osmotic pressure are negligible and that water is driven into the soil mainly by gravity ϕ m and p gradients 2 2 2 2 dry phase to account for the unsaturated conditions of the field under awd irrigation the soil water retention θ ϕ and hydraulic conductivity function k ϕ proposed by van genuchten mualem was used the function is given by 18 θ ϕ θ r θ s θ r 1 α ϕ n m θ s ϕ 0 ϕ 0 19 k ϕ k s s e l 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 20 s e θ ϕ θ r θ s θ r 21 m 1 1 n n 1 where θ r is the residual water content θ s is the saturated water content k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity s e is effective saturation and α n and l are pore connectivity parameters 2 2 2 3 evapotranspiration sink the crop evapotranspiration was treated as a sink just like in the approach of hydrus simunek et al 2013 which is defined as the volume of water removed from a unit volume of soil per unit time due to plant water uptake the catchment modeling framework cmf has a way of determining the potential evapotranspiration q tpot from the precalculated et o series kraft 2018 it uses the equation 22 q tpot f r x et o x a 1 1000 23 f r r layer i 0 layers r i where q tpot is the potential root water uptake et o is the potential root water uptake a is the surface area and f r is the root mass in a soil layer per total root mass in a soil column to properly account for the water losses due to evapotranspiration in different soil layers the bulk evapotranspiration was partitioned on the soil layers based on its root content this was done by determining the depth of rootzone directly from field measurements since the root architecture is hardly distributed uniformly all throughout the depth of rootzone cmf applies the fraction at root depth function that assumes an exponential decline of the root mass within the root depth it can be any value between 0 and 1 with 1 having a uniformly distributed root content all throughout the root depth in calculating the actual evapotranspiration et act cmf utilizes a feddes like approach this approach limits the water uptake of roots from soil layers based on the layers water content the flux is assumed zero when the matric potential ϕ m is below wilting point i e soil moisture tension of 15 bars or 152 96 mh2o if the matric potential is below 2 mh2o with an equivalent soil moisture tension of 0 2 bars linear function of root water uptake is implemented towards the wilting point this critical matric potential was based on the safe awd threshold which has an equivalent 15 cm water level depth from the soil surface carrijo et al 2018 there is no water limitation if the matric potential is above 2 mh2o the mathematical structure of the conditions mentioned is shown below 24 q tact q tpot 1 1 0 ϕ m 2 158 ϕ m ϕ m ϕ m 5 m 153 m 153 m 2 2 3 subsurface flow boundary conditions 2 2 3 1 upper boundary the upper boundary of the soil control volume considered in the model is the soil surface exposed to the atmospheric conditions the upper boundary condition in the field is given by the equation 26 ϕ 0 h z f v z where h is the surface water depth and z is the gravitational potential due to the boundary s exposure in free surface the boundary is affected by several atmospheric conditions brought by climatic variables and human influences in lowland paddy fields there is always the existence of ponding depth mainly caused by irrigation and rainfall accounting for the presence of surface water the volume height function f v was used to relate the water level with its driving force potential at the same time the soil control volume is vulnerable to the evapotranspiration process the term h in the equation is thus dependent on rainfall irrigation evaporation infiltration and subsurface processes like root water uptake and deep percolation positive water flux is experienced when having soil water entry like rainfall and irrigation while there is negative water flux when having soil water exit from soil control volume just like in the case of evapotranspiration large fluctuations in moisture storage and pressure head at the soil surface through time is to be expected in paddy fields under awd irrigation the maximum soil water entry into the soil surface will be numerically described using the soil matrix infiltration based on the darcy s equation defined as follows 27 q max ϕ surface ϕ soil δ z k a cell 28 k k θ layer k sat where q max is the maximum matrix infiltration ϕ surface is the potential at the soil surface ϕ soil is the potential at the middle of the first soil layer k sat is the conductivity of the wetted surface k θ layer is the conductivity of the first layer s center and δ z is the elevation difference between the soil surface the center of the first soil layer the actual soil water infiltration was considered to be the minimum between potential infiltration q max or current inflow to the surface q in which can be due to irrigation and rainfall mathematically it is expressed as 29 q act min q max q in surfacewater 2 2 3 2 lower boundary the water table was treated as an outlet boundary in the model prior investigations on the site s static water table depth revealed a value of around 1 4 m which can recede by half meter during steady state pumping this shallow water table is influential in driving the subsurface flow in the root zone depth darcy s law was used in estimating the flux at the root zone depth with the equation 30 ϕ q bot k θ δ ϕ tot l a 31 ϕ tot ϕ m θ z where q bot is the bottom flux δ ϕ tot is the difference of total water potentials of the two soil layers l is the distance between two soil layers k θ is the geometric mean conductivity a is the cross sectional area of the flux ϕ m θ is the matric potential and z is the elevation or gravitational potential flux towards the groundwater table was regarded as negative since it is an outflow from the soil control volume 2 2 4 coupling strategy the integration of one dimensional surface flow with the vertical soil water balance model was done using python the one dimensional surface flow was based on the zero inertia model while the vertical soil water balance model was constructed using the python package cmf the flow chart of the model is shown in fig 1 in the model testing of schmitz and seus 1990 the distance of the advancing tip was determined by discretizing time however this was proven by wohling et al 2006 to be prone to convergence problems due to the discontinuity of the infiltration process the said authors then suggested to discretize space instead to determine the time of advance in every predefined distance hence the distance was discretized in this study and so as to match with the discretized computational nodes for the subsurface flow model these nodes are individually capable of performing subsurface flow equations based on the soil physical properties and hydrologic conditions initially the infiltration process was neglected and an advance time was taken from an initial guess this initial guess time t n the time required for the advancing tip to reach the space node n will yield for an initial value of a o t the calculated a o t was then used in computing for u tip t and u t which are both inputs for the estimation of the revised a o t using the implicit iteration relation form the surface flow depth h t was computed by simply dividing a o t with the flow width convergence is achieved if the absolute difference between the initial and revised value of h t is less than a precision criterion for convenience it was assumed in this study that the total inflow volume is uniformly distributed in the basin width thus enabling the model to consider surface flow per meter width mathematically the convergence criterion is expressed as 32 h t initial h t revised ε where ε is the tolerance value in the program a tolerance value of 0 001 was used the final value of time t n and h t n from the convergence was used as the upper boundary condition for the subsurface flow model the infiltration volume estimated by the subsurface flow model from the given δ t t n t 0 was then fed back to the surface flow model to estimate t n 1 and h t n 1 the values to be used for the next calculation step the calculation procedure continues until the end of the basin length is reached 2 2 5 field data collection for model development 2 2 5 1 water level and irrigation advance times field experiment was performed in june to july 2020 the onset of the wet season two 14 m x 44 m conjunctive plots labeled as plots 1 and 2 in fig 2 under awd irrigation were used for the experimental setup the drying cycles were applied 14 days after transplanting the 10 cm high bunds covered with plastic lining to eliminate seepage losses in each plot five 4 diameter and 30 cm long awd pipes were installed 15 cm deep and were spaced evenly by 8 m along the transect of the field length soils were removed inside down to the pipe bottom to let the soil water enter the pipe perforations each of the awd pipes was equipped with a sensor unit that can monitor water level with measurement accuracy of 6 error determined from laboratory tests and surface temperature in real time specifically the sensor is composed of modules of temperature sensor ultrasonic distance sensor and data logger modules all integrated into an esp8266 based microcontroller powered by solar cells and batteries the wireless sensors connect to the wi fi installed in the pump house and the connectivity was amplified by a 5 km range wi fi extender since the site is situated in an off grid community both the wi fi and the extender were powered up by 12 v batteries that were alternately replenished from time to time the water level sensor measures the distance between the surface water and the sensor itself since the sensor is being mounted on top of the pipe every sensor reading has to be adjusted with respect to the elevation of the sensor from the soil surface to properly reflect the field water depth the water level data was monitored hourly along with the data of temperature humidity and battery voltage online data were managed through google sheets whose database was incorporated with an alert messaging system that can inform users about the irrigation schedule battery state and sensor malfunction shown in fig 3 is the schematic of the sensor setup and telemetry of the automated system another awd pipe which has similar dimensions with the automated pipes was placed on the side portion of both plots for manual validation of sensor data manual observations of the water level were made for twice a day i e during 8 am and 2 pm the sensor measurements were continuous within the two weeks time of the experiment except during the three consecutive days of storm event that transpired within the experimental period the irrigation advance times along the field transect were observed manually with the sensor equipped awd pipes serving as the distance stations where the data are recorded irrigation in each plot was managed through an inlet whose discharge was measured using a current meter two batches of irrigation events were observed during the experiment it is also important to note that since the experiment was performed during wet season the occasional rainfall events hindered the water level from receding further into the subsurface that is why the irrigation was already triggered even without reaching the safe awd threshold nonetheless the surface subsurface water level fluctuations observed in the experiment still technically exhibited alternate wetting and drying schemes the first batch was composed of an observation from plot 1 while the data from plot 2 was invalidated by a rainfall event in the middle of the observation it should be noted that rainfall is not included in the assumption during the irrigation advance phase of the model the water level was 5 cm below the soil surface prior the irrigation event the second batch was composed of irrigation events observed in both plots irrigation advance times on one plot were taken after the other the water level depth was observed at 10 cm below the soil surface 2 2 5 2 tensions fluxes and crop data tensiometers of 12 and 24 lengths were installed in both plots for the measurement of soil moisture at 10 cm and 20 cm depths respectively these tensiometers were strategically placed in the field to measure moisture at a depth of the plow layer and hardpan and were designed to estimate tensions at 0 15 cm and 15 30 cm deep respectively climatological data such as rainfall and evapotranspiration were also collected during the experiment an 8 standard rain gauge was setup to measure rainfall while the water balance tanks were used to determine the fluxes of evaporation percolation and crop evapotranspiration small changes of water level in the tanks were measured using the micrometer hook gauge daily observations were made every 8 am and 2 pm of the day the same time observation with the water level this schedule is also in accordance with the standard set by the world meteorological organization at 8 00 greenwich mean time gmt the rainfall input into the subsurface flow model comes in the form of fluxes specifically in mm day however rainfall depths observed in the rain gauge are the lump sums in between times which the reading was taken with the hourly reading of the wireless sensor the water level data from the wireless sensors were reflective of the soil surfaces fluxes with this detailed information one can simply determine the time of occurrence and duration of a rainfall event thus the rainfall depth observations from the rain gauge were analyzed in conjunction with the water level data from the sensors in coming up with the rainfall fluxes the water balance tanks were also used to measure soil water fluxes the setup was mainly composed of three 50 cm cylindrical tanks made from galvanized iron sheet covered with epoxy paint one tank serves for the measurement of the evaporation the other one for percolation while the last one is for the evapotranspiration a similar setup was used by sivapalan 2015 while luyun et al 2020 has termed the setup as the modified lysimeter the evaporation tank is characterized by a 30 cm tall tank with a bottom cover this tank similarly functions as a basin that is partially submerged in the paddy soil to approximate the surface evaporation the percolation tank is a 50 cm tall and bottomless tank designed to protrude through the hardpan layer this was made to ensure that the water level changes measured in this tank are representative of the downward movement of the soil water onto the hardpan profile the evapotranspiration tank has similar dimensions with the percolation tank except for the fact that a rice crop is planted inside the tank the water balance parameters were calculated as follows 34 percolation b a 35 et a c b a where a is the flux reading from the evaporation tank b is the flux reading from the percolation tank and c is the flux reading from the evapotranspiration tank evapotranspiration readings from the tanks were fed into the subsurface flow model in time series pot experiments were also installed in both plots to monitor the progression of root depths through time root depth estimates were done prior to irrigation event 2 2 5 3 soil hydraulic properties the percolation data from the water balance tank were used to approximate the hydraulic conductivity of the hardpan layer aimrun et al 2010 have termed percolation loss and vertical saturated hydraulic conductivity k s as the same parameters the percolation tank was designed to protrude through the hardpan thus making the assumption that the average percolation observed in the tank represents the k s of the hardpan layer the soil water retention properties were determined in the laboratory using pressure plate apparatus the soil samples were collected using the soil auger that is capable of undisturbed sampling the collected soil samples were then transferred into the 5 cm diameter sampling rings compatible with the pressure plate dimensions the soil samples were subjected to the following tensions 0 1 bar 0 3 bar 1 bar 3 bars 5 bars 10 bars and 15 bars results from the pressure plate analysis were fed into the swrc fit a web based program by seki 2007 that can generate soil water retention curves out of pressure plate data the program returned a van genuchten curve fit with the pertinent values of saturated volumetric content ɸ and pore connectivity parameters α and ɳ 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration the coupled model was calibrated using the data gathered from the first four days of the entire experimental run the subsurface flow model was calibrated first using the water level data from the sensors followed by the calibration of the surface flow model using the first irrigation advance dataset observed in plot 1 in the subsurface flow model two soil layers were generated the top soil layer was set as the plow layer while the bottom layer was set as the hardpan layer the depth of the plow layer was estimated using a steel ruler while the hardpan thickness was approximated using the drilling rig test which was a separate activity conducted at the experimental site the pertinent parameters in the subsurface flow model which are the soil saturated water content φ and pore connectivity factors α and n were determined using pressure plate experiment and were adjusted within reasonable ranges through manual fine tuning with coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse absolute error ae standard deviation of errors sd and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse as the main objective functions the tuning process involved adjustments of values through trial and error while keeping tab on the reasonable ranges of the parameters based on the values for clay soils provided by multiple investigators yang and you 2013 leij et al 1996 ghanbarian alavijeh et al 2010 zhang et al 2018 another important input into the subsurface flow model is the saturated hydraulic conductivity k s which was approximated in the hardpan layer using the water balance tank readings while the k s of the plow layer was initially taken from the values provided by rezaei et al 2012 which was also adjusted by trial and error the fraction of root depth f r was set to 1 considering a commonly distributed root density along depth due to shallow hardpan layer kameoka et al 2016 on another note the only relevant parameter for the surface flow model is the manning s roughness coefficient whose value was initially set at 0 05 taken from the simulation study of jung et al 2011 and was also optimized by manual fine tuning performance indicators used were r2 rmse and nse the water level which was manually observed from the awd pipe was used in initializing the conditions of the surface subsurface flow model the hourly data from the wireless sensors was able to provide a more well defined pattern of the field water level fluctuations due to a finer temporal resolution these added information in between manual observation gaps have greatly facilitated the model calibration process the final optimum parameter values used in the model calibration are shown in tables 1 and 2 respectively while the model predicted and observed surface irrigation advance times are shown in fig 6 figs 4 and 5 present the visual comparison between the coupled model predicted values and sensor values for plots 1 and 2 respectively subsurface flow model calibration results revealed a good match between the model predicted and the sensor s water level data in plot 1 as attested by the several statistical parameters where the calibrated subsurface flow model had garnered 0 91 0 79 7 17 mm 5 75 mm and 4 23 mm for r2 nse rmse ae and sd respectively on the other hand the model had yielded less superior calibration fit with sensor values in plot 2 with r2 nse rmse ae and sd values of 0 74 0 60 8 78 mm 7 51 mm and 5 51 mm respectively the less superior calibration fit of the model under the plot 2 data is mainly due to the spatial water level variations measured by the sensors a wider spread exhibited by the data from plot 2 may be attributed to the uneven hardpan depths as observed from the actual field works the impact of this microtopographic variation was manifested in inferior model calibration performance values in plot 2 as compared to plot 1 the effect of the non uniform hardpan depths on the soil water dynamics is further investigated on the validation part of this paper interestingly the microtopographic variation may not be the only factor that affects the model performance the error in sensor readings may partly have an influence as well the water level sensor in the experiment makes use of ultrasonic pulses in determining the depth of the water surface from the top of the awd pipe highly correlating the sound s time of travel with the traversed distance environmental factors such as air temperature and humidity greatly affect the speed of soundwaves when the sensor is initialized the sensor is triggered to release sound signal from its transmitter the signal then traverses in an open space until it hits the water surface and then eventually bounces back into the sensor s receiver higher temperatures induce faster sound speed consequently rendering shorter round trip time travel in between the sensor and the water surface this occurrence results in an underestimated depth than the actual on the other hand the tendency of the ultrasonic sensor to overestimate depths was also demonstrated by pilling 2015 pertaining to the instabilities to be due to the lack of monotonicity an occurrence of miscommunication between the components of the internal circuitry when reading peak signals the reported anomaly consequently results in longer travel time of sound than the actual which further corresponds to overestimated values after calibrating the subsurface flow model the surface flow model was followed results exhibited a very good match with the observed data as reflected by a high r2 and nse of 0 99 and 0 97 respectively and a relatively low rmse of 3 14 min as shown in fig 6 the rmse of the calibrated model indicates that on the average the predicted advance time value is just 3 14 min off from the actual value which is reasonably acceptable from the practical viewpoint it is also worth noting that a single set of calibration parameters was used for both plots 1 and 2 due to the challenge imposed by the data acquisition itself as what has been reported by wohling et al 2004 having the same set of calibration data is only within reason as both plots originally came from a single plot which was only subdivided into two commensurate plots for the purpose of replication this also applies with the input parameters of the subsurface flow model 3 2 model validation the remaining portion of the entire sensor dataset was used for model validation specifically the sensor water depth data observed in plots 1 and 2 starting from the fifth day up to the end of the experiment run were used for the validation of the subsurface flow model while the second batch of the observation data of irrigation advance times in both plots 1 and 2 were used for the surface flow model validation evaluation of the goodness of fit between simulated and observed values was carried out using the same performance indicators used in the calibration of both model domains figs 7 and 8 show the visual comparison of model computed values with sensor values during model validation the validation of the subsurface flow model using the sensor data resulted to acceptable performance on plot 1 dataset fig 7 with r2 0 76 rmse 10 87 mm nse 0 60 ae 7 46 mm and sd 7 91 mm unlike model calibration the values suggest a lower level of model performance however the statistical parameters are still within acceptable limits the peak of deviation between the observed and predicted values can be found at the portion where the model falls short in emulating the water level rise due to the rainfall influx the model demonstrated a prominent spike in water level whereas the sensor values reflected the water level increase with a more subtle rise we consider this circumstance to be mainly due to the two following reasons firstly the rain gauge setup in the field is incapable of determining rainfall intensity and its exact time and duration of occurrence as mentioned previously the subsurface flow model requires rainfall intensity as input the hourly time step simulation of the subsurface flow model comes with the price of providing in return a definitive influx details in the absence of automatic rain gauges args that are capable of acoustic measurement the rainfall data from conventional rain gauge were analyzed together with the sensor data to approximate the rainfall time duration the magnitude of rainfall taken in every observation time was distributed over the time duration at which the water level rise was observed this analysis was applied in between reading schedules however this crude estimation of rainfall intensity tends to miss out the occurrence of consecutive rainfall events of different intensity and duration that transpired in between those reading schedules this somehow limits the model from accurately depicting those types of instantaneous scenario secondly we have observed the difference in rate at which the plow layer in between the two plots has achieved stability from cultivation the plow layer in plot 2 was able to stabilize faster than plot 1 this achieved stability is characterized by increased bulk density due to settlement and subsequent irrigation the change in soil property may have influenced how the plow layer reacts to surface fluxes although more investigations are needed to further examine this phenomenon the model predicted values are more reflective of the water level spike exhibited by the sensor data in plot 2 albeit the time offset difference which may have been due to the rough rainfall time duration estimate however the model displayed a relatively poor performance on plot 2 sensor dataset fig 9 with r2 0 81 rmse 11 08 mm nse 0 32 ae 10 00 mm and sd 7 15 mm this unveils the limitation of purely relying on r2 alone as the sole indicator of model performance as it only reflects the relationship between the movement of the model and datapoints but completely miss out the detail that they are moving on different levels the unsatisfactory indicator values were the manifestation of sensors 8 and 9 having significantly different water depth data at the same time which may have been caused by the uneven hardpan depths observed in plot 2 we look into this phenomena as a consequence of uneven hardpan depths observed in plot 2 to investigate further an attempt was made to improve the model performance by using the actual depth of hardpan where the sensor was located instead of the average value for the whole plot the recalibrated results shown in fig 9 revealed a slight drop in performance values except for the nse that went from 0 60 to 0 63 the model at two different hardpan depths also showed no significant difference however a different observation is seen in the revalidation of the model fig 10 demonstrates that the correlation remains fairly good but the rest of the performance indices have improved especially the nse with a final value of 0 71 that is more than twice the initial value nse 0 32 this may imply that the effect of hardpan characteristics on field water recession is hardly detected during shallow water depths but becomes evident when the water level goes deeper in the subsurface the effect of the hardpan layer on root water uptake and how it can become the primary factor for vertical root growth restriction in rice ecosystems have been discussed on several studies clark et al 2002 samson et al 2002 the soil layers in which the root can extract soil water is limited to the extent at which the root can propagate naturally deeper rooting system can extract more soil water at deeper soil layers the experiment of yu et al 2007 on maize have shown that the plants with a restricted rooting depth of up to 20 cm had a much lower rate of water uptake as compared to the plants with deeper rooting depth this only shows the effect of impeded root growth pattern on the water intake capability of the plant however further investigation may still be needed from a plant physiological standpoint in giving light to the dynamics of soil water recession as affected by the root growth dynamics after all evapotranspiration shares a large chunk of the soil water balance output in the lowland rice field environment even with this current knowledge gap one cannot simply deny the importance of the plow pan characteristics on soil water movement in paddy fields importance of the plow pan characteristics on soil water movement in paddy fields after validating the subsurface flow model validation of the surface flow model was then performed fig 11 shows the irrigation advance trajectories of the observed values from plots 1 and 2 and the simulated values of the model as accompanied by the performance indices rmse r2 and nse results of the validation revealed that the model fits agreeably with the actual data all the predicted values suggest a very high correlation with the observed data as supported by high r2 greater than 0 976 and nse greater than 0 88 the rmse also suggests that the predicted advance time cannot be more than 6 12 min away from the actual value compared with the calibration the performance of the model during validation slightly declined the validated model generally predicted a slightly faster irrigation advance time as compared to the field values with a particularly higher tendency to overestimate the time on greater horizontal distances this observation is somehow similar with the finding of schmitz and seus 1990 in testing their coupled model despite using a different infiltration model another important factor that may have influenced a faster simulated irrigation advance time is the preferential flows caused by mudholes it is important to consider that the irrigation events used for model validation occurred on a later date mudholes in both plots were inevitably made through time because of the frequent manual checking of the sensors along the transect of the field this may have caused preferential flows in the soil during the irrigation advance which is not considered in the model soil cracking may also be another factor to look at during the dry cropping season as the solar radiation is more intensive during those times the shrinking of clay soils due to the rapid depletion of soil moisture in the surface creates spaces in the soil where water can easily pass through the effect of preferential flows brought by soil cracking was also observed by wohling et al 2004 when conducting furrow experiments for their coupled model increasing the soil infiltration rate which resulted to longer irrigation advance times nevertheless the coupled model developed in this study still performs satisfactorily provided that the appropriate soil physical and surface hydraulic parameters are used 3 3 model simulation for the wet and dry cropping seasons different rainfall scenarios were formulated to simulate and project field water level for the rest of the wet cropping season fig 12 and the dry cropping season fig 13 using the calibrated and validated coupled model the first scenario is when there is no increase in rainfall amount normal and the others are when there are reductions in rainfall amount by 25 50 and 75 respectively for the dry cropping season the same scenarios were made with the additional 25 and 50 in the normal rainfall values the historical records of daily total rainfall and potential evapotranspiration computed using fao penman monteith equation were distributed in the 24 hour period while the depth of rice rootzone was set to 0 5 m all throughout the season as suggested by fao 1998 for the minimum value of the maximum rooting depth for rice crop coefficients of rice in its different growth stages were adopted from the study of david 1983 to come up with the actual evapotranspiration values irrigation event was triggered in the model to obtain a ponded depth of 3 cm above the ground surface before the water level threshold is about to be reached and when the field needs to be constantly flooded for the rice flowering stage which can take place around 10 13 weeks after sowing this is in accordance with the recommendations of the international rice research institute irri that the field be flooded continuously a week before and after the rice reproductive phase bouman et al 2007 as can be seen in fig 12 drying cycles are evident at 50 and 75 rainfall scenarios the rainfall above 25 can keep the water level above the soil surface that draining the excess water is essential this only highlights the fact that awd practice is not really suitable during the wet cropping season in the experimental site even with the 25 reduction in normal rainfall the simulation further showed that the water level at 50 reduced rainfall can experience occasional drying cycles but can still be maintained above the awd threshold however further decrease in rainfall amount by 75 shows the need for irrigation water although only once the field under the 50 and 75 rainfall scenarios must be irrigated during the peak time of the rice reproductive stage simulated irrigation schedules revealed the need of one irrigation event for the 25 rainfall scenario while 2 irrigation events for the 75 rainfall scenario with an interval of 9 days for the water level simulation in the dry cropping season shown in fig 13 the scarcity of rainfall events allows the alternate wetting and drying irrigation to take place every after 5 7 days following the disappearance of surface water on the average the irrigation interval during the dry cropping season is estimated to range between 10 and 12 days for the awd irrigation schedule while approximately 4 5 days can be observed for the constant flooding schedule in all of the scenarios considered only the 50 rainfall scenario made a deviation in schedule from the rest with a longer irrigation interval by one day the rest of the scenarios produced almost identical results due to the excessively low rainfall amounts that even a 25 change cannot make a significant difference results of the simulation revealed that the modeled interval values are within expectations based on the commonly reported interval of 1 to more than 10 days according to the past investigators bouman et al 2007 however it is important to keep in mind that the model only considers the vertical movement of soil water flow ignoring the effect of seepage losses which can further shorten the simulated irrigation interval aside from using daily totals of evapotranspiration a better projection can be achieved by providing separate evapotranspiration rates between day and night a feature which can be considered by the model in this way a more realistic curve of water level recession can be captured with drastic slopes during the day and gradual changes during the night as compared to the uniform decrease in water level when using the average evapotranspiration values furthermore the rainfall intensity and its exact duration time can also be specified in the model since the subsurface flow model also considers the physics of the soil water movement on top of the volume balance approach with this the model can capture instantaneous fluxes and sudden water level spikes due to high intensity rainfall events since the model can simulate water levels in an hourly basis irrigation schedule can be forecasted in a specific time of the day together with the irrigation inflow rate and duration just like what have been done in the simulations 4 conclusion the coupled surface subsurface flow model developed in this study can be used to simulate the irrigation advance and recession in awd irrigated rice fields which cannot be addressed by the traditional irrigation models results from the surface subsurface flow simulation have revealed acceptable performance indices and portrayed a good match with the observed water level and irrigation advance time datasets the simulation has further uncovered the importance of hardpan characteristics and how it can affect water recession in the subsurface by influencing soil properties and root growth restriction furthermore the model has shown its capability to project field water level under different rainfall scenarios for both the wet and dry cropping seasons climatological parameters and soil properties inherent to lowland rice cropping systems are important considerations when predicting soil water recession in awd threshold this study has provided results that may lead to a better perspective on soil water dynamics in lowland rice field and has generated a useful tool for simulating water level fluctuations in awd irrigated rice fields for different anticipated rainfall scenarios ultimately while further improvement can still be done the

9588,the lack of coupled surface subsurface flow models applied in lowland rice irrigation systems is the prime mover for this research this study aimed to develop a coupled model that can capture the soil water dynamics in paddy rice fields and to calibrate and validate the model using actual field data to serve as basis for irrigation water management using alternate wetting and drying awd for lowland rice production systems the zero inertia surface flow model was internally coupled with the richards based subsurface flow model through python scripts boundary conditions were set accordingly based on lowland rice field scenarios irrigation advance times were observed manually while field water recession data were collected using wireless sensors model calibration showed acceptable results for the surface flow r 2 0 99 se 0 97 rmse 3 14 min and subsurface flow r 2 0 71 nse 0 60 mse 8 78 mm sd 5 51 mm ae 7 51 mm domains likewise model validation yielded acceptable results for surface flow r 2 0 98 nse 0 88 rmse 6 12 min and subsurface flow r 2 0 76 nse 0 60 rmse 10 87 mm sd 7 91 mm ae 8 28 mm respectively results also showed the model s capability to simulate water level fluctuations in awd irrigated rice fields during the wet and dry seasons under various rainfall scenarios model projections showed the need for awd irrigation practice when the normal rainfall had been reduced by 75 during the wet season dry season simulations indicated the need for awd under all rainfall scenarios simulation results have further unveiled the importance of the plow pan characteristics in influencing the soil water flow behavior this study was also able to address the limitations of the existing coupled models that could not meet the boundary conditions of paddy rice field settings ultimately the model developed in this study could serve as basis for the development of optimum irrigation operation schemes in awd irrigated rice fields graphical abstract ga1 keywords coupled surface subsurface flow model soil water dynamics irrigation water management alternate wetting and drying lowland rice model simulation 1 introduction basin irrigation of lowland rice consumes huge quantities of water due to its continuous flooding nature in view of the threats of water scarcity to sustainability food production and ecosystems services of rice fields alternative water management practices have been developed bouman et al 2007 these practices include alternate wetting and drying awd irrigation which is a form of irrigation management wherein the field water level is allowed to decline down to a safe water level threshold below the ground surface before triggering another irrigation event this results to less water use and a longer irrigation interval as compared to usual irrigation practices past studies have demonstrated the benefits of awd among the most notable and highly cited studies include that of lampayan et al 2015 which provided empirical evidence that awd could lead to huge water savings without significantly affecting grain yield an alternative to direct measurements and monitoring of water level fluctuations in awd irrigated rice fields is through the use of water balance models in simulating the soil water dynamics of basin irrigation system one can opt to use traditional surface irrigation simulation programs or soil water hydrologic modeling platforms depending upon the goal of the study in the traditional surface irrigation models the surface water flow is described based on mathematical equations of continuity and momentum it gives more emphasis on the details of the horizontal water movement above the soil surface and also models the vertical soil water movement in an overly simplified manner by considering the infiltration values as mere representation of the subsurface flow on the contrary the existing soil water hydrologic modeling platforms simulate the soil water movement in an explicit detail but lacks the capability in covering the surface water flow in basin irrigation setting between the two methods of simulation the use of soil water hydrologic modeling platforms is the most widely used for basin irrigation under awd as suggested in various literature e g tan et al 2013 li et al 2017 darzi naftchali et al 2017 among others most investigators of awd irrigation look more upon the crop water use efficiency and the effect of drying cycles on the rice crop welfare and that evaluating the basin irrigation performance under awd in the context of surface irrigation modeling is somewhat rare nevertheless the use of mathematical models in surface flow hydraulics play an important role in system irrigation design management and evaluation however there are certain limitations on the application of traditional surface flow models in awd irrigated basin traditional surface irrigation models operate on the assumption that the entire amount of irrigation volume that goes inside the field is the same volume that infiltrates and percolates into the soil profile thus eliminating the effect of crop factors and climatic variables in influencing the changes in field water level or the soil moisture in general this assumption is not applicable in basin irrigation system especially when considering the presence of plow pan layer that causes the surface water to stagnate for a long time thus giving the crop evapotranspiration to comprise its fine share of influence in field water recession another limitation of traditional surface irrigation models is its use of empirical infiltration functions such as lewis kostiakov and its variants like mecenzev model zerihun et al 2005 the parameters of the said infiltration functions are event specific and cannot account for the initial soil moisture content more so cover the soil moisture redistribution through time another limitation is its assumption on the homogeneity of the soil structure along its depth thus completely neglecting the importance of plow pan in paddy rice fields and its effect on soil water dynamics these limitations of the surface flow models can be addressed by physically based soil water flow models however they lack the capability in simulating the surface flow dynamics that fit the basin irrigation setting which can be key figures in irrigation duration decisions and irrigation performance evaluations many researchers have recognized the shortcoming of using the traditional surface irrigation models alone and tried to address the problem by combining surface flow irrigation model with soil water flow model schmitz et al 1985 tabuada et al 1995 wohling et al 2004 zerihun et al 2005 bautista et al 2010 banti et al 2011 among others some even tried to couple a crop model to a previously coupled surface subsurface flow model wohling and mailhol 2007 wohling and schmitz 2007 apparently most of these studies are only applicable in furrow irrigation systems zerihun et al 2005 also developed a coupled surface subsurface flow model for the basin irrigation in lemon tree orchard while the coupled model of bautista et al 2010 was prototyped in borders and basins although applied in basin irrigation the boundary conditions used in their models cannot meet the requirements of the paddy rice field setting to date no studies have yet applied a coupled surface subsurface flow model in basin irrigation with rice based cropping systems let alone the ones under awd irrigation regime where prediction of the field water recession up to the safe awd threshold is crucial this study aimed to develop a coupled model consisting of a surface flow model for the estimation of the irrigation advance and a vertical soil water flow model for the estimation of irrigation recession along with the other water balance components in awd irrigated basin which could serve as basis for developing efficient irrigation water management schemes 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description this study was performed at the lowland pilot test site of the pcari wiseir project located in brgy san roque victoria laguna with coordinates of 14 13 13 51 n and 121 19 11 94 e the study area has a highly intensive production of rice regularly cultivated during the wet and dry cropping season respectively a tropical climate system prevails in the area with significant rainfall during most of the months usually between may to december and with a relatively short dry period usually between january to april on the average the site receives an annual precipitation of 2084 mm and experiences an ambient temperature of 27 1 c maximum precipitation occurs during the month of july 279 mm while the driest month occurs in february with a rainfall depth averaging to 29 mm climate data org 2018 almost all of the rice fields in the vicinity of the site are not serviced by the national irrigation administration nia because it is situated at the downstream end of existing irrigation systems hence a shallow tube well stw is used to irrigate the crop production area owing to the presence of a highly productive shallow aquifer reducing fuel cost in pumping groundwater for irrigation provides a compelling incentive for the farmers in the area to employ alternate wetting and drying awd irrigation technique during the dry cropping season 2 2 model development 2 2 1 surface flow model the surface flow model is based on the analytical solution of the zero inertia zi equations of schmitz and seus 1990 the model assumes a moving momentum representative cross section in the water body and accounts for the time varying character of infiltration the model also offers no restriction on the use of different infiltration formula which makes it flexible in coupling with a subsurface flow model since the influence of the infiltration process on the momentum is accounted for the governing equations for the zi model are read as schmitz and seus 1990 1 a t u x a a τ u q 2 y x s o u 2 k 2 r 4 3 qu ga where x is the horizontal distance t is the elapsed time y x t is surface flow depth u x t is the surface flow velocity a x t is the flow cross sectional area q x t is the infiltration rate r is the hydraulic radius g is the gravitational constant and k 1 n in which n is the manning roughness coefficient multiplying both sides of the momentum equation with r 4 3 and assuming that the momentum can be continuously represented by the momentum at the center of the water body x thus substituting for a u q and r a t a x t t u t u x t t q t q x t t r t r x t t leads to the equation 3 r 4 3 y a a x u t k 2 s o q t g u t a t r t 4 3 the analytical solution of schmitz and seus 1990 yields the following set of equations for a x t and a o t 4 x t a o t 1 x x tip α 5 a o t x tip c 1 α u t k 2 s o q t u t g a t r t 4 3 α where c 1 and α are geometric coefficients of the flow cross section x tip is the location of the advancing water front and a o t is equal to a 0 t it is worth noting that a t and r t are implicitly dependent on a o t the derivation of its implicit iteration relation form is shown in the paper of schmitz and seus 1990 subsequently by employing a x t to the continuity equation leads to the equation for the flow velocity u x t read as 6 u x t u tip t u tip t u o t 0 x tip q x t dx a o t 1 x x tip x x tip q x t dx a x t for the determination of the center of gravity x t and x tip the following equations are used 7 x t x tip α 2 8 x tip α 1 a o t v in t v inf t where v in t is the volume of water supplied in the field and v inf t is the volume of water infiltrated in the field calculated as 9 v inf t 0 t 0 x tip q x t dtdx the value of v inf t is computed by the subsurface model cf the section entitled subsurface flow model schmitz and seus 1990 have provided the table of equations sequentially arranged for the iterative computation of the advance phase the sets of equations were derived for rectangular borders and basins with α 3 7 basin width b y and r y 2 2 1 1 surface flow upstream boundary conditions for simplification it was assumed in the model that inflow fluctuations at the start of an irrigation event is negligible and that a constant discharge is achieved right away this leads to the simplification of v in t 0 t q 0 t d t to be equal to q 0 t for the initial condition the following are assumed 10 x tip t 0 0 11 q x 0 t q 0 t 12 a x tip t 0 13 u x tip t u tip t 2 2 1 2 surface flow downstream boundary conditions at the end of the advance phase the boundary condition at the downstream end would be an impermeable dike thus no surface runoff will be incurred outside the basin the solution of schmitz and seus 1990 is only applicable during the advance phase thus a simple volume balance calculation was employed when the advancing front had reached downstream dike this assumption leads to the surface flow cross section to be dependent on the inflow volume and infiltrated volume it is mathematically expressed as 14 a o t v in t v inf t l where l is the basin length the computation of the irrigation cutoff time was based on target irrigation depth expressed in the equation form 15 t cutoff t l t req where t cutoff is the cutoff time t l is the irrigation advance time at the end of the field and t req is the required intake opportunity time and can be determined by querying the program about the time when the last node in the simulation field is fully saturated with water when the irrigation is cutoff discharge at the inlet will have zero flow the final surface water depth right after cutoff was computed based on a o t and the field water recession at any point along the field was predicted based on the subsurface flow model 2 2 2 subsurface flow model 2 2 2 1 ponded phase since the soil surface in the rice field is relatively flat and that paddy bunds are sealed with plastic lining one dimensional vertical water movement was assumed in this study in this regard lateral subsurface flow such as seepage was neglected which leaves soil water fluxes along the soil column be described using the richards equation combined with a sink term shown below 16 θ t z k θ ϕ z 1 s h t where θ is the volumetric soil water content ϕ is the hydraulic head t is the time z is the elevation k is the saturated hydraulic conductivity and s is the sink term for root water uptake the hydraulic head ϕ for porous media is commonly defined as 17 ϕ tot z ϕ m θ p ϕ o where ϕ tot is the total dynamic head z is the elevation or the gravitational potential ϕ m θ is the matric potential as a function of soil moisture p is the hydrostatic pressure and ϕ o is the osmotic potential but in the model it was assumed that water flow due to thermal gradients and osmotic pressure are negligible and that water is driven into the soil mainly by gravity ϕ m and p gradients 2 2 2 2 dry phase to account for the unsaturated conditions of the field under awd irrigation the soil water retention θ ϕ and hydraulic conductivity function k ϕ proposed by van genuchten mualem was used the function is given by 18 θ ϕ θ r θ s θ r 1 α ϕ n m θ s ϕ 0 ϕ 0 19 k ϕ k s s e l 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 20 s e θ ϕ θ r θ s θ r 21 m 1 1 n n 1 where θ r is the residual water content θ s is the saturated water content k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity s e is effective saturation and α n and l are pore connectivity parameters 2 2 2 3 evapotranspiration sink the crop evapotranspiration was treated as a sink just like in the approach of hydrus simunek et al 2013 which is defined as the volume of water removed from a unit volume of soil per unit time due to plant water uptake the catchment modeling framework cmf has a way of determining the potential evapotranspiration q tpot from the precalculated et o series kraft 2018 it uses the equation 22 q tpot f r x et o x a 1 1000 23 f r r layer i 0 layers r i where q tpot is the potential root water uptake et o is the potential root water uptake a is the surface area and f r is the root mass in a soil layer per total root mass in a soil column to properly account for the water losses due to evapotranspiration in different soil layers the bulk evapotranspiration was partitioned on the soil layers based on its root content this was done by determining the depth of rootzone directly from field measurements since the root architecture is hardly distributed uniformly all throughout the depth of rootzone cmf applies the fraction at root depth function that assumes an exponential decline of the root mass within the root depth it can be any value between 0 and 1 with 1 having a uniformly distributed root content all throughout the root depth in calculating the actual evapotranspiration et act cmf utilizes a feddes like approach this approach limits the water uptake of roots from soil layers based on the layers water content the flux is assumed zero when the matric potential ϕ m is below wilting point i e soil moisture tension of 15 bars or 152 96 mh2o if the matric potential is below 2 mh2o with an equivalent soil moisture tension of 0 2 bars linear function of root water uptake is implemented towards the wilting point this critical matric potential was based on the safe awd threshold which has an equivalent 15 cm water level depth from the soil surface carrijo et al 2018 there is no water limitation if the matric potential is above 2 mh2o the mathematical structure of the conditions mentioned is shown below 24 q tact q tpot 1 1 0 ϕ m 2 158 ϕ m ϕ m ϕ m 5 m 153 m 153 m 2 2 3 subsurface flow boundary conditions 2 2 3 1 upper boundary the upper boundary of the soil control volume considered in the model is the soil surface exposed to the atmospheric conditions the upper boundary condition in the field is given by the equation 26 ϕ 0 h z f v z where h is the surface water depth and z is the gravitational potential due to the boundary s exposure in free surface the boundary is affected by several atmospheric conditions brought by climatic variables and human influences in lowland paddy fields there is always the existence of ponding depth mainly caused by irrigation and rainfall accounting for the presence of surface water the volume height function f v was used to relate the water level with its driving force potential at the same time the soil control volume is vulnerable to the evapotranspiration process the term h in the equation is thus dependent on rainfall irrigation evaporation infiltration and subsurface processes like root water uptake and deep percolation positive water flux is experienced when having soil water entry like rainfall and irrigation while there is negative water flux when having soil water exit from soil control volume just like in the case of evapotranspiration large fluctuations in moisture storage and pressure head at the soil surface through time is to be expected in paddy fields under awd irrigation the maximum soil water entry into the soil surface will be numerically described using the soil matrix infiltration based on the darcy s equation defined as follows 27 q max ϕ surface ϕ soil δ z k a cell 28 k k θ layer k sat where q max is the maximum matrix infiltration ϕ surface is the potential at the soil surface ϕ soil is the potential at the middle of the first soil layer k sat is the conductivity of the wetted surface k θ layer is the conductivity of the first layer s center and δ z is the elevation difference between the soil surface the center of the first soil layer the actual soil water infiltration was considered to be the minimum between potential infiltration q max or current inflow to the surface q in which can be due to irrigation and rainfall mathematically it is expressed as 29 q act min q max q in surfacewater 2 2 3 2 lower boundary the water table was treated as an outlet boundary in the model prior investigations on the site s static water table depth revealed a value of around 1 4 m which can recede by half meter during steady state pumping this shallow water table is influential in driving the subsurface flow in the root zone depth darcy s law was used in estimating the flux at the root zone depth with the equation 30 ϕ q bot k θ δ ϕ tot l a 31 ϕ tot ϕ m θ z where q bot is the bottom flux δ ϕ tot is the difference of total water potentials of the two soil layers l is the distance between two soil layers k θ is the geometric mean conductivity a is the cross sectional area of the flux ϕ m θ is the matric potential and z is the elevation or gravitational potential flux towards the groundwater table was regarded as negative since it is an outflow from the soil control volume 2 2 4 coupling strategy the integration of one dimensional surface flow with the vertical soil water balance model was done using python the one dimensional surface flow was based on the zero inertia model while the vertical soil water balance model was constructed using the python package cmf the flow chart of the model is shown in fig 1 in the model testing of schmitz and seus 1990 the distance of the advancing tip was determined by discretizing time however this was proven by wohling et al 2006 to be prone to convergence problems due to the discontinuity of the infiltration process the said authors then suggested to discretize space instead to determine the time of advance in every predefined distance hence the distance was discretized in this study and so as to match with the discretized computational nodes for the subsurface flow model these nodes are individually capable of performing subsurface flow equations based on the soil physical properties and hydrologic conditions initially the infiltration process was neglected and an advance time was taken from an initial guess this initial guess time t n the time required for the advancing tip to reach the space node n will yield for an initial value of a o t the calculated a o t was then used in computing for u tip t and u t which are both inputs for the estimation of the revised a o t using the implicit iteration relation form the surface flow depth h t was computed by simply dividing a o t with the flow width convergence is achieved if the absolute difference between the initial and revised value of h t is less than a precision criterion for convenience it was assumed in this study that the total inflow volume is uniformly distributed in the basin width thus enabling the model to consider surface flow per meter width mathematically the convergence criterion is expressed as 32 h t initial h t revised ε where ε is the tolerance value in the program a tolerance value of 0 001 was used the final value of time t n and h t n from the convergence was used as the upper boundary condition for the subsurface flow model the infiltration volume estimated by the subsurface flow model from the given δ t t n t 0 was then fed back to the surface flow model to estimate t n 1 and h t n 1 the values to be used for the next calculation step the calculation procedure continues until the end of the basin length is reached 2 2 5 field data collection for model development 2 2 5 1 water level and irrigation advance times field experiment was performed in june to july 2020 the onset of the wet season two 14 m x 44 m conjunctive plots labeled as plots 1 and 2 in fig 2 under awd irrigation were used for the experimental setup the drying cycles were applied 14 days after transplanting the 10 cm high bunds covered with plastic lining to eliminate seepage losses in each plot five 4 diameter and 30 cm long awd pipes were installed 15 cm deep and were spaced evenly by 8 m along the transect of the field length soils were removed inside down to the pipe bottom to let the soil water enter the pipe perforations each of the awd pipes was equipped with a sensor unit that can monitor water level with measurement accuracy of 6 error determined from laboratory tests and surface temperature in real time specifically the sensor is composed of modules of temperature sensor ultrasonic distance sensor and data logger modules all integrated into an esp8266 based microcontroller powered by solar cells and batteries the wireless sensors connect to the wi fi installed in the pump house and the connectivity was amplified by a 5 km range wi fi extender since the site is situated in an off grid community both the wi fi and the extender were powered up by 12 v batteries that were alternately replenished from time to time the water level sensor measures the distance between the surface water and the sensor itself since the sensor is being mounted on top of the pipe every sensor reading has to be adjusted with respect to the elevation of the sensor from the soil surface to properly reflect the field water depth the water level data was monitored hourly along with the data of temperature humidity and battery voltage online data were managed through google sheets whose database was incorporated with an alert messaging system that can inform users about the irrigation schedule battery state and sensor malfunction shown in fig 3 is the schematic of the sensor setup and telemetry of the automated system another awd pipe which has similar dimensions with the automated pipes was placed on the side portion of both plots for manual validation of sensor data manual observations of the water level were made for twice a day i e during 8 am and 2 pm the sensor measurements were continuous within the two weeks time of the experiment except during the three consecutive days of storm event that transpired within the experimental period the irrigation advance times along the field transect were observed manually with the sensor equipped awd pipes serving as the distance stations where the data are recorded irrigation in each plot was managed through an inlet whose discharge was measured using a current meter two batches of irrigation events were observed during the experiment it is also important to note that since the experiment was performed during wet season the occasional rainfall events hindered the water level from receding further into the subsurface that is why the irrigation was already triggered even without reaching the safe awd threshold nonetheless the surface subsurface water level fluctuations observed in the experiment still technically exhibited alternate wetting and drying schemes the first batch was composed of an observation from plot 1 while the data from plot 2 was invalidated by a rainfall event in the middle of the observation it should be noted that rainfall is not included in the assumption during the irrigation advance phase of the model the water level was 5 cm below the soil surface prior the irrigation event the second batch was composed of irrigation events observed in both plots irrigation advance times on one plot were taken after the other the water level depth was observed at 10 cm below the soil surface 2 2 5 2 tensions fluxes and crop data tensiometers of 12 and 24 lengths were installed in both plots for the measurement of soil moisture at 10 cm and 20 cm depths respectively these tensiometers were strategically placed in the field to measure moisture at a depth of the plow layer and hardpan and were designed to estimate tensions at 0 15 cm and 15 30 cm deep respectively climatological data such as rainfall and evapotranspiration were also collected during the experiment an 8 standard rain gauge was setup to measure rainfall while the water balance tanks were used to determine the fluxes of evaporation percolation and crop evapotranspiration small changes of water level in the tanks were measured using the micrometer hook gauge daily observations were made every 8 am and 2 pm of the day the same time observation with the water level this schedule is also in accordance with the standard set by the world meteorological organization at 8 00 greenwich mean time gmt the rainfall input into the subsurface flow model comes in the form of fluxes specifically in mm day however rainfall depths observed in the rain gauge are the lump sums in between times which the reading was taken with the hourly reading of the wireless sensor the water level data from the wireless sensors were reflective of the soil surfaces fluxes with this detailed information one can simply determine the time of occurrence and duration of a rainfall event thus the rainfall depth observations from the rain gauge were analyzed in conjunction with the water level data from the sensors in coming up with the rainfall fluxes the water balance tanks were also used to measure soil water fluxes the setup was mainly composed of three 50 cm cylindrical tanks made from galvanized iron sheet covered with epoxy paint one tank serves for the measurement of the evaporation the other one for percolation while the last one is for the evapotranspiration a similar setup was used by sivapalan 2015 while luyun et al 2020 has termed the setup as the modified lysimeter the evaporation tank is characterized by a 30 cm tall tank with a bottom cover this tank similarly functions as a basin that is partially submerged in the paddy soil to approximate the surface evaporation the percolation tank is a 50 cm tall and bottomless tank designed to protrude through the hardpan layer this was made to ensure that the water level changes measured in this tank are representative of the downward movement of the soil water onto the hardpan profile the evapotranspiration tank has similar dimensions with the percolation tank except for the fact that a rice crop is planted inside the tank the water balance parameters were calculated as follows 34 percolation b a 35 et a c b a where a is the flux reading from the evaporation tank b is the flux reading from the percolation tank and c is the flux reading from the evapotranspiration tank evapotranspiration readings from the tanks were fed into the subsurface flow model in time series pot experiments were also installed in both plots to monitor the progression of root depths through time root depth estimates were done prior to irrigation event 2 2 5 3 soil hydraulic properties the percolation data from the water balance tank were used to approximate the hydraulic conductivity of the hardpan layer aimrun et al 2010 have termed percolation loss and vertical saturated hydraulic conductivity k s as the same parameters the percolation tank was designed to protrude through the hardpan thus making the assumption that the average percolation observed in the tank represents the k s of the hardpan layer the soil water retention properties were determined in the laboratory using pressure plate apparatus the soil samples were collected using the soil auger that is capable of undisturbed sampling the collected soil samples were then transferred into the 5 cm diameter sampling rings compatible with the pressure plate dimensions the soil samples were subjected to the following tensions 0 1 bar 0 3 bar 1 bar 3 bars 5 bars 10 bars and 15 bars results from the pressure plate analysis were fed into the swrc fit a web based program by seki 2007 that can generate soil water retention curves out of pressure plate data the program returned a van genuchten curve fit with the pertinent values of saturated volumetric content ɸ and pore connectivity parameters α and ɳ 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration the coupled model was calibrated using the data gathered from the first four days of the entire experimental run the subsurface flow model was calibrated first using the water level data from the sensors followed by the calibration of the surface flow model using the first irrigation advance dataset observed in plot 1 in the subsurface flow model two soil layers were generated the top soil layer was set as the plow layer while the bottom layer was set as the hardpan layer the depth of the plow layer was estimated using a steel ruler while the hardpan thickness was approximated using the drilling rig test which was a separate activity conducted at the experimental site the pertinent parameters in the subsurface flow model which are the soil saturated water content φ and pore connectivity factors α and n were determined using pressure plate experiment and were adjusted within reasonable ranges through manual fine tuning with coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse absolute error ae standard deviation of errors sd and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse as the main objective functions the tuning process involved adjustments of values through trial and error while keeping tab on the reasonable ranges of the parameters based on the values for clay soils provided by multiple investigators yang and you 2013 leij et al 1996 ghanbarian alavijeh et al 2010 zhang et al 2018 another important input into the subsurface flow model is the saturated hydraulic conductivity k s which was approximated in the hardpan layer using the water balance tank readings while the k s of the plow layer was initially taken from the values provided by rezaei et al 2012 which was also adjusted by trial and error the fraction of root depth f r was set to 1 considering a commonly distributed root density along depth due to shallow hardpan layer kameoka et al 2016 on another note the only relevant parameter for the surface flow model is the manning s roughness coefficient whose value was initially set at 0 05 taken from the simulation study of jung et al 2011 and was also optimized by manual fine tuning performance indicators used were r2 rmse and nse the water level which was manually observed from the awd pipe was used in initializing the conditions of the surface subsurface flow model the hourly data from the wireless sensors was able to provide a more well defined pattern of the field water level fluctuations due to a finer temporal resolution these added information in between manual observation gaps have greatly facilitated the model calibration process the final optimum parameter values used in the model calibration are shown in tables 1 and 2 respectively while the model predicted and observed surface irrigation advance times are shown in fig 6 figs 4 and 5 present the visual comparison between the coupled model predicted values and sensor values for plots 1 and 2 respectively subsurface flow model calibration results revealed a good match between the model predicted and the sensor s water level data in plot 1 as attested by the several statistical parameters where the calibrated subsurface flow model had garnered 0 91 0 79 7 17 mm 5 75 mm and 4 23 mm for r2 nse rmse ae and sd respectively on the other hand the model had yielded less superior calibration fit with sensor values in plot 2 with r2 nse rmse ae and sd values of 0 74 0 60 8 78 mm 7 51 mm and 5 51 mm respectively the less superior calibration fit of the model under the plot 2 data is mainly due to the spatial water level variations measured by the sensors a wider spread exhibited by the data from plot 2 may be attributed to the uneven hardpan depths as observed from the actual field works the impact of this microtopographic variation was manifested in inferior model calibration performance values in plot 2 as compared to plot 1 the effect of the non uniform hardpan depths on the soil water dynamics is further investigated on the validation part of this paper interestingly the microtopographic variation may not be the only factor that affects the model performance the error in sensor readings may partly have an influence as well the water level sensor in the experiment makes use of ultrasonic pulses in determining the depth of the water surface from the top of the awd pipe highly correlating the sound s time of travel with the traversed distance environmental factors such as air temperature and humidity greatly affect the speed of soundwaves when the sensor is initialized the sensor is triggered to release sound signal from its transmitter the signal then traverses in an open space until it hits the water surface and then eventually bounces back into the sensor s receiver higher temperatures induce faster sound speed consequently rendering shorter round trip time travel in between the sensor and the water surface this occurrence results in an underestimated depth than the actual on the other hand the tendency of the ultrasonic sensor to overestimate depths was also demonstrated by pilling 2015 pertaining to the instabilities to be due to the lack of monotonicity an occurrence of miscommunication between the components of the internal circuitry when reading peak signals the reported anomaly consequently results in longer travel time of sound than the actual which further corresponds to overestimated values after calibrating the subsurface flow model the surface flow model was followed results exhibited a very good match with the observed data as reflected by a high r2 and nse of 0 99 and 0 97 respectively and a relatively low rmse of 3 14 min as shown in fig 6 the rmse of the calibrated model indicates that on the average the predicted advance time value is just 3 14 min off from the actual value which is reasonably acceptable from the practical viewpoint it is also worth noting that a single set of calibration parameters was used for both plots 1 and 2 due to the challenge imposed by the data acquisition itself as what has been reported by wohling et al 2004 having the same set of calibration data is only within reason as both plots originally came from a single plot which was only subdivided into two commensurate plots for the purpose of replication this also applies with the input parameters of the subsurface flow model 3 2 model validation the remaining portion of the entire sensor dataset was used for model validation specifically the sensor water depth data observed in plots 1 and 2 starting from the fifth day up to the end of the experiment run were used for the validation of the subsurface flow model while the second batch of the observation data of irrigation advance times in both plots 1 and 2 were used for the surface flow model validation evaluation of the goodness of fit between simulated and observed values was carried out using the same performance indicators used in the calibration of both model domains figs 7 and 8 show the visual comparison of model computed values with sensor values during model validation the validation of the subsurface flow model using the sensor data resulted to acceptable performance on plot 1 dataset fig 7 with r2 0 76 rmse 10 87 mm nse 0 60 ae 7 46 mm and sd 7 91 mm unlike model calibration the values suggest a lower level of model performance however the statistical parameters are still within acceptable limits the peak of deviation between the observed and predicted values can be found at the portion where the model falls short in emulating the water level rise due to the rainfall influx the model demonstrated a prominent spike in water level whereas the sensor values reflected the water level increase with a more subtle rise we consider this circumstance to be mainly due to the two following reasons firstly the rain gauge setup in the field is incapable of determining rainfall intensity and its exact time and duration of occurrence as mentioned previously the subsurface flow model requires rainfall intensity as input the hourly time step simulation of the subsurface flow model comes with the price of providing in return a definitive influx details in the absence of automatic rain gauges args that are capable of acoustic measurement the rainfall data from conventional rain gauge were analyzed together with the sensor data to approximate the rainfall time duration the magnitude of rainfall taken in every observation time was distributed over the time duration at which the water level rise was observed this analysis was applied in between reading schedules however this crude estimation of rainfall intensity tends to miss out the occurrence of consecutive rainfall events of different intensity and duration that transpired in between those reading schedules this somehow limits the model from accurately depicting those types of instantaneous scenario secondly we have observed the difference in rate at which the plow layer in between the two plots has achieved stability from cultivation the plow layer in plot 2 was able to stabilize faster than plot 1 this achieved stability is characterized by increased bulk density due to settlement and subsequent irrigation the change in soil property may have influenced how the plow layer reacts to surface fluxes although more investigations are needed to further examine this phenomenon the model predicted values are more reflective of the water level spike exhibited by the sensor data in plot 2 albeit the time offset difference which may have been due to the rough rainfall time duration estimate however the model displayed a relatively poor performance on plot 2 sensor dataset fig 9 with r2 0 81 rmse 11 08 mm nse 0 32 ae 10 00 mm and sd 7 15 mm this unveils the limitation of purely relying on r2 alone as the sole indicator of model performance as it only reflects the relationship between the movement of the model and datapoints but completely miss out the detail that they are moving on different levels the unsatisfactory indicator values were the manifestation of sensors 8 and 9 having significantly different water depth data at the same time which may have been caused by the uneven hardpan depths observed in plot 2 we look into this phenomena as a consequence of uneven hardpan depths observed in plot 2 to investigate further an attempt was made to improve the model performance by using the actual depth of hardpan where the sensor was located instead of the average value for the whole plot the recalibrated results shown in fig 9 revealed a slight drop in performance values except for the nse that went from 0 60 to 0 63 the model at two different hardpan depths also showed no significant difference however a different observation is seen in the revalidation of the model fig 10 demonstrates that the correlation remains fairly good but the rest of the performance indices have improved especially the nse with a final value of 0 71 that is more than twice the initial value nse 0 32 this may imply that the effect of hardpan characteristics on field water recession is hardly detected during shallow water depths but becomes evident when the water level goes deeper in the subsurface the effect of the hardpan layer on root water uptake and how it can become the primary factor for vertical root growth restriction in rice ecosystems have been discussed on several studies clark et al 2002 samson et al 2002 the soil layers in which the root can extract soil water is limited to the extent at which the root can propagate naturally deeper rooting system can extract more soil water at deeper soil layers the experiment of yu et al 2007 on maize have shown that the plants with a restricted rooting depth of up to 20 cm had a much lower rate of water uptake as compared to the plants with deeper rooting depth this only shows the effect of impeded root growth pattern on the water intake capability of the plant however further investigation may still be needed from a plant physiological standpoint in giving light to the dynamics of soil water recession as affected by the root growth dynamics after all evapotranspiration shares a large chunk of the soil water balance output in the lowland rice field environment even with this current knowledge gap one cannot simply deny the importance of the plow pan characteristics on soil water movement in paddy fields importance of the plow pan characteristics on soil water movement in paddy fields after validating the subsurface flow model validation of the surface flow model was then performed fig 11 shows the irrigation advance trajectories of the observed values from plots 1 and 2 and the simulated values of the model as accompanied by the performance indices rmse r2 and nse results of the validation revealed that the model fits agreeably with the actual data all the predicted values suggest a very high correlation with the observed data as supported by high r2 greater than 0 976 and nse greater than 0 88 the rmse also suggests that the predicted advance time cannot be more than 6 12 min away from the actual value compared with the calibration the performance of the model during validation slightly declined the validated model generally predicted a slightly faster irrigation advance time as compared to the field values with a particularly higher tendency to overestimate the time on greater horizontal distances this observation is somehow similar with the finding of schmitz and seus 1990 in testing their coupled model despite using a different infiltration model another important factor that may have influenced a faster simulated irrigation advance time is the preferential flows caused by mudholes it is important to consider that the irrigation events used for model validation occurred on a later date mudholes in both plots were inevitably made through time because of the frequent manual checking of the sensors along the transect of the field this may have caused preferential flows in the soil during the irrigation advance which is not considered in the model soil cracking may also be another factor to look at during the dry cropping season as the solar radiation is more intensive during those times the shrinking of clay soils due to the rapid depletion of soil moisture in the surface creates spaces in the soil where water can easily pass through the effect of preferential flows brought by soil cracking was also observed by wohling et al 2004 when conducting furrow experiments for their coupled model increasing the soil infiltration rate which resulted to longer irrigation advance times nevertheless the coupled model developed in this study still performs satisfactorily provided that the appropriate soil physical and surface hydraulic parameters are used 3 3 model simulation for the wet and dry cropping seasons different rainfall scenarios were formulated to simulate and project field water level for the rest of the wet cropping season fig 12 and the dry cropping season fig 13 using the calibrated and validated coupled model the first scenario is when there is no increase in rainfall amount normal and the others are when there are reductions in rainfall amount by 25 50 and 75 respectively for the dry cropping season the same scenarios were made with the additional 25 and 50 in the normal rainfall values the historical records of daily total rainfall and potential evapotranspiration computed using fao penman monteith equation were distributed in the 24 hour period while the depth of rice rootzone was set to 0 5 m all throughout the season as suggested by fao 1998 for the minimum value of the maximum rooting depth for rice crop coefficients of rice in its different growth stages were adopted from the study of david 1983 to come up with the actual evapotranspiration values irrigation event was triggered in the model to obtain a ponded depth of 3 cm above the ground surface before the water level threshold is about to be reached and when the field needs to be constantly flooded for the rice flowering stage which can take place around 10 13 weeks after sowing this is in accordance with the recommendations of the international rice research institute irri that the field be flooded continuously a week before and after the rice reproductive phase bouman et al 2007 as can be seen in fig 12 drying cycles are evident at 50 and 75 rainfall scenarios the rainfall above 25 can keep the water level above the soil surface that draining the excess water is essential this only highlights the fact that awd practice is not really suitable during the wet cropping season in the experimental site even with the 25 reduction in normal rainfall the simulation further showed that the water level at 50 reduced rainfall can experience occasional drying cycles but can still be maintained above the awd threshold however further decrease in rainfall amount by 75 shows the need for irrigation water although only once the field under the 50 and 75 rainfall scenarios must be irrigated during the peak time of the rice reproductive stage simulated irrigation schedules revealed the need of one irrigation event for the 25 rainfall scenario while 2 irrigation events for the 75 rainfall scenario with an interval of 9 days for the water level simulation in the dry cropping season shown in fig 13 the scarcity of rainfall events allows the alternate wetting and drying irrigation to take place every after 5 7 days following the disappearance of surface water on the average the irrigation interval during the dry cropping season is estimated to range between 10 and 12 days for the awd irrigation schedule while approximately 4 5 days can be observed for the constant flooding schedule in all of the scenarios considered only the 50 rainfall scenario made a deviation in schedule from the rest with a longer irrigation interval by one day the rest of the scenarios produced almost identical results due to the excessively low rainfall amounts that even a 25 change cannot make a significant difference results of the simulation revealed that the modeled interval values are within expectations based on the commonly reported interval of 1 to more than 10 days according to the past investigators bouman et al 2007 however it is important to keep in mind that the model only considers the vertical movement of soil water flow ignoring the effect of seepage losses which can further shorten the simulated irrigation interval aside from using daily totals of evapotranspiration a better projection can be achieved by providing separate evapotranspiration rates between day and night a feature which can be considered by the model in this way a more realistic curve of water level recession can be captured with drastic slopes during the day and gradual changes during the night as compared to the uniform decrease in water level when using the average evapotranspiration values furthermore the rainfall intensity and its exact duration time can also be specified in the model since the subsurface flow model also considers the physics of the soil water movement on top of the volume balance approach with this the model can capture instantaneous fluxes and sudden water level spikes due to high intensity rainfall events since the model can simulate water levels in an hourly basis irrigation schedule can be forecasted in a specific time of the day together with the irrigation inflow rate and duration just like what have been done in the simulations 4 conclusion the coupled surface subsurface flow model developed in this study can be used to simulate the irrigation advance and recession in awd irrigated rice fields which cannot be addressed by the traditional irrigation models results from the surface subsurface flow simulation have revealed acceptable performance indices and portrayed a good match with the observed water level and irrigation advance time datasets the simulation has further uncovered the importance of hardpan characteristics and how it can affect water recession in the subsurface by influencing soil properties and root growth restriction furthermore the model has shown its capability to project field water level under different rainfall scenarios for both the wet and dry cropping seasons climatological parameters and soil properties inherent to lowland rice cropping systems are important considerations when predicting soil water recession in awd threshold this study has provided results that may lead to a better perspective on soil water dynamics in lowland rice field and has generated a useful tool for simulating water level fluctuations in awd irrigated rice fields for different anticipated rainfall scenarios ultimately while further improvement can still be done the model developed in this study could serve as basis for developing efficient irrigation water management schemes for lowland crop production systems declaration of competing interest the authors

9589,soil moisture and salinity are both important environmental variables for crop growth in agricultural production areas optical remote sensing datasets from different sensors are available for estimating soil moisture and salinity from different spatial temporal scales given the co regulation of soil spectral reflectance sr by soil moisture and salinity the simultaneous estimation of moisture and salinity in saline soil may result in great bias and uncertainty to address this problem soil samples were collected in the salinized area during irrigation synchronously processed multi spectral images were acquired from sentinel 2 satellite the spectrum mechanism responsive to soil moisture and salinity was verified by statistical tests and its corresponding mathematical model mss model was developed to identify the dominant factors affecting sr and to inverse moisture and salinity the result showed that the effects of moisture and salinity were temporally constant facilitation and changing from inhibition to facilitation respectively during the irrigation stages the dominant factors in the variation of sr shifted from salinity and moisture salinity interaction to moisture reliable accuracy was achieved in the moisture and salinity estimation using inverse mss model the profile from the series of estimations can further reveal the dynamic changes of soil moisture and

2013 boren and boschetti 2020 dong et al 2019 ambrosone et al 2020 the estimation of soil moisture and salinity content using optical satellite images has been investigated extensively soil

falls in the spectrum boundaries fixed by a series of feature parameters these parameters are demonstrated as promising proxies for indicating soil properties amani et al 2016 for example urban et al 2018 input these parameters to an inversion model to detect the spatial temporal variation of soil moisture content across different seasons over southern kruger national park where annual drought was evident owing to the discrepancy on relationships between the soil moisture salinity and their corresponding spectral reflectance at wavelengths ranging from visible to swir the reasonable selection of wavelengths is needed before modeling el harti et al 2016 moreover the availability of spectral indexes and learning machine techniques in a modeling process has turned out to be useful for more reliable estimation for example wang et al 2019 constructed a soil salinity inversion model with machine learning techniques and optimal combination of spectral indexes to monitor the dynamic changes of soil salinity in dry and wet seasons over ebinur lake region xinjiang china as is mentioned above estimating soil moisture or salinity content using optical data is essentially a process to quantify differentiated performance of spectral reflectance at wavelengths in this process soil moisture or salinity content is assumed to be the main even the only factor affecting the spectral reflectance generated from optical satellite images at regional scale thus this estimation may sometimes be compromised by the irrigation process where highly variable moisture and salinity content are both significant factors determining the spectral behavior at wavelengths from visible to swir lievens et al 2009 melendez pastor et al 2008 to address this issue research efforts focused on how

the semi empirical exponential model was presented to measure the responsive process of soil spectral reflectance to soil moisture and salinity in term of a physical mechanism of radiation transmission theory wang et al 2012 yang and yu 2017 this model can interpret the individual effect of soil moisture and salinity on soil spectral reflectance and allows well defined allocation of soil spectral reflectance to each factor however this model structure of binary equation with first order has inherent algorithmic weaknesses and may be insufficient to reveal the effect especially the co effect of soil moisture and salinity on soil spectral reflectance bell 1997 farifteh et al 2008 meanwhile the experimental data for these models was typically acquired from soil samples and the corresponding spectral reflectance was obtained under artificial indoor light instead of natural sunlight the results derived from ideal indoor experimental conditions may be insufficient to represent real outdoor situation xu et al 2010 xu et al 2019 schug et al 2020 yu et al 2010 in this research an extended semi empirical exponential model mss model was proposed to address the issues mentioned

hetao irrigation area of inner mongolia autonomous region of china figure s1 the local is characterized by typical continental climate the precipitation about 158 mm for annual precipitation is much lower than evaporation about 2000 mm for annual pan evaporation which was measured by wush tv2 evaporator tianjin meteorological instrument factory china this characteristic introduces challenges into local agricultural production and development gao et al 2018 the soil type derived from field investigation is mainly clay loam composed of fine particles due to the physical structure of poor permeability clay loam is unfavorable for irrigation jia et al 2017 the crop cultivated in experimental area within the study period march june is spinach spinacia oleracea l its growing season ranges

plantation area suffering from different degrees of soil salinization posing potential threats for local agricultural production thus accurate and timely estimation of soil salinity content at regional scale is significant for developing strategies regarding the mitigation of soil salinization 2 2 collection and process for experimental data 2 2 1 acquisition and pre process of sentinel 2

carried out using snap software released by the european space agency 2 2 2 collection and pre process of soil samples the layout of sampling sites was designed by considering local irrigation

the whole study period march june 2019 for each sentinel 2 observation the area involving bare soil was required to be identified and extracted by a land use classification model the modeling data for this model was derived from in situ field survey and manually labeling sentinel 2 rgb images by using the supervised method of decision tree and kennard stone algorithm land use classification model was trained iteratively until the accuracy of validation dataset was close to that of modeling dataset the detailed results regarding classification accuracy and the spatial temporal variation of land use types over the study area can be found in table s4 and figure s4 s5 respectively 2 4 spectrum mechanism responsive for soil moisture and salinity correlation analysis between soil properties sml and ssl and soil spectral reflectance at wavelengths from visible to swir was performed for statistical significance test the level of significance was defined as p 0 05 the testing result was that spectral reflectance of wavelengths at green red edge nir and swir were sensitive to both soil moisture and salinity and hereafter referred as to soil spectral reflectance table s5 the soil spectral reflectance with different soil properties were used for a series of statistical analyses variance analysis multiply compare and trend test to determine the mechanism of soil spectral reflectance

fulfil needs for generating the accurate simulation of soil spectral reflectance under different sml and ssl compared with binary linear regression binary quadratic regression has intrinsic

irrigation process the moisture salinity interaction of green and red edge were restraint and synergism respectively for nir and swir their moisture salinity interaction differed in irrigation stages moreover due to observed weak moisture salinity interaction during irrigation single regulated effect existed in the specified ranges of sml or ssl for example when ssl ranged from 0 4 to 1 0 soil spectral reflectance of nir was singly regulated by soil moisture due to no significant difference in this range figs 2g and 3g this single regulatory effect can be accounted from the reduced sensitivity of soil salinity to soil spectral reflectance due to introduced irrigation water 3 2 the proportional contributions of soil moisture and salinity to spectrum the proportional contribution of each factor i e soil moisture soil salinity and moisture salinity interaction to soil spectral reflectance under different irrigation stages was measured by the constructed mss models fig 4 during the whole irrigation proportional contributions of soil moisture soil salinity and moisture salinity interaction displayed the tendency of increase decrease and decrease respectively this tendency indicates that the dominant factor s affecting soil spectral reflectance change s in irrigation without irrigation soil salinity and moisture salinity interaction were both the dominant factors with irrigation soil moisture became the dominant factor after irrigation soil moisture remained dominant factor except for green 3 3 accuracy of the simultaneous estimation of soil moisture and salinity as is known in derived formulas from section 2 5 3 soil moisture and salinity content can be simultaneously estimated by mss models with two wavelengths referred as the cmss model four different wavelengths correspond to six cmss models the accuracy of these models was evaluated using r 2 and rmse table 1 the order of prediction accuracy at different irrigation stages from high to low were before irrigation after irrigation and during irrigation compared with soil moisture the cmss model displayed better estimation in soil salinity for a specified irrigation stage the optimal cmss model needs to be selected from six cmss models due to their observed difference in prediction accuracy fig 5 for soil moisture the wavelength combination of optimal cmss model at three different irrigation stages was green nir green nir and green red edge respectively for soil salinity it was green nir nir swir and nir swir respectively 3 4 spatial temporal monitoring of soil moisture and salinity fig 6 presents the spatial temporal monitoring of soil moisture and salinity at field scale spatial resolution of 10 m before irrigation soil moisture and salinity concentrated on 16 38 and 0 5 respectively fig 6a and f excessive soil salinity 2 0 in north and south of study area generate obvious salt aggregation however the salt aggregation in southern disappeared with the increase of soil moisture fig 6b and g on may 2 the ranges of soil moisture and salinity concentrated on 21 84 and 0 5 respectively reaching the highest and lowest level throughout the study period fig 6c and h then the south of study area witnessed a gradual decrease of soil moisture meanwhile the center and south displayed a gradual increase of soil salinity fig 6c e overall soil moisture and salinity over study area increased from 13 40 to 15 18 zc 0 08 and decreased from 0 97 to 0 80 zc 0 12 respectively these changes indicate that irrigation can regulate soil moisture distribution and mitigate soil salinity aggregation fig 7 however soil salinity rebounded within a short time after irrigation this are likely related to inefficient irrigation ill suited irrigation quota can provoke the backflow of irrigation water resulting in water table rise and soil salt aggregation chang et al 2019 yu et al 2010 accordingly some measures should be taken to mitigate this issue the irrigation quota should be further optimized under the premise of satisfying crop growth xu et al 2010 meanwhile for timely excretion of soil salt the operational efficiency of drainage systems also needs improving e g deepening the drainage ditch wen et al 2020 4 discussion 4 1 spectral response mechanism of soil moisture and salinity soil moisture and salinity are main factors affecting soil spectral reflectance with wavelength from visible to swir in agricultural production area with irrigation management farifteh 2011 inverse gaussian function model ig model as a technique to guide the quantification of geometric metrics in soil spectrum curves has been promising in predicting moisture in the surface saline soil lobell and asner 2002 whiting et al 2004 however the development of ig model requires optical data with continuous wavelengths and regional application of ig model only depends on the fewer available hyperspectral satellites compared with multispectral satellites different from the ig model the mss model is derived from optical data at particular wavelength instead of continuous wavelengths that is the application of the mss model has less data requirements thus can be supported by numerously launched multispectral satellites meanwhile due to its flexibility to accommodate nonlinear fluctuation of soil spectral reflectance the mss model has advanced performance in estimating soil moisture and salinity content in irrigation area with strong variability of soil moisture and salinity content during irrigation period farifteh et al 2008 moreover the mss model can explicitly interpret the process of the spectral response to moisture and salinity and reveal the influencing mechanism of irrigation on soil spectral reflectance 4 2 effect of irrigation stages on moisture salinity content monitoring remote sensing based estimation of soil moisture or salinity in irrigation areas has been carried out around the world using various modeling techniques casterad et al 2018 dari et al 2020 gonzález zamora et al 2016 guo et al 2018 hajj et al 2017 han et al 2019 veysi et al 2020 welle and mauter 2017 the optimal spectral indexes from procedural selection has become a vital step in the construction of inversion models in this step the selected spectral indexes served as the input for inversion model training regardless of numerical differences of these indexes in irrigation stages in fact as is known in sections 3 1 and 3 2 there are apparent differences of spectral response mechanism in irrigation stages failure to treat these differences may distort the modeling process which is further propagated into the estimated results causing unknown bias and uncertainties accordingly the mss model without considering irrigation stages called the wmss model was developed by comparing the accuracy of the wmss model and mss model the effect of irrigation stages on the estimation in term of spectral response mechanism can be understood fig 8 during the whole process of irrigation the simulation of the wmss model demonstrated an overestimation of soil moisture content and underestimation of soil salinity content the accuracy of wmss was lower than that of the mss model the problem of reduced prediction accuracy during irrigation compares favorably with previous researches these findings indicate that the conventional modeling strategies still probably suffer from partially unreasonable prediction caused by irrigation even though they allow overall satisfying estimation with its strength in powerful generalization and robustness thus irrigation information should be thoroughly considered in the practical inversion modelling based on optical satellite data however the spatial mismatch between irrigation information irrigation stages at regional scale and optical data spectral reflectance at field scale may cause additional uncertainty when irrigation information is used as an input for the inversion model thus the spatially fine resolution observation of irrigation information is crucial to the extensive application of the mss model the irrigation information can be determined according to the relative difference of soil surface roughness in irrigation stages due to the hydraulic properties of irrigation water due to the high sensitivity of synthetic aperture radar sar signal to soil surface characteristics sar e g sentinel 1 has great potential in identifying irrigation information at field scale baghdadi et al 2018 bazzi et al 2020 ullmann and stauch 2020 thus the applicability of sentinel 1 was initially assessed by associating the vv backscatters of sentinel 1 with proportional contributions of each factor i e moisture salinity and moisture salinity interaction to soil spectral reflectance fig 10 the observed aggregation phenomena of vh backscatters represents the distribution pattern of proportional contributions of key factors to some extent for example for swir the proportional contribution of soil moisture displayed an increasing tendency with vh backscatter increase however this tendency was not statistically significant due to a degree of the overlap of proportional contribution among vh backscatters for this the relationship between the signal from sar and spectral response mechanism should be further investigated in the future 4 3 effect of land vegetation alternation on soil moisture and salinity content the variation of soil moisture and salinity content over the study area is not only closely related to the irrigation management but also the land vegetation alternation feng et al 2005 zhao et al 2014 a typical area with high frequency of land vegetation alternation figure s5 was chosen from the study area and used for the study of the effect of the land vegetation alternation on soil moisture and salinity content fig 9 compared with bare soil the water loss in crop field is relatively lower due to the lower evaporation capacity of vegetation so the crop field has higher soil moisture content than bare soil this phenomenon exists in the non irrigated area e g the iv region in fig 9d e and it will gradually disappear with the re distribution of soil moisture content caused by persistent strong evaporation e g the vi region in fig 10 c d meanwhile the gap of moisture content between the crop field and bare soil diminishes after irrigation e g the i region in fig 9b c without irrigation aggregation of soil salinity can be observed after crop harvesting e g the iv region in fig 9i j the timely and efficient irrigation helps to mitigate the aggregation of soil salinity e g the iv region in fig 9f g in general reasonable irrigation of crop field can contribute to the soil salinization management in the determination of irrigation quota both crop water requirement and groundwater depth should be taken into consideration so as to avoid aggravation of soil salinity after crop harvesting this area also needs timely irrigation otherwise salinity control will be hindered and the cultivation time for subsequent crop will be delayed 5 conclusion currently the simultaneous estimation of soil moisture and salinity content using optical data suffers from low prediction accuracy to overcome this limitation the mechanism of soil spectral reflectance responsive to soil moisture and salinity was explored and used for the construction of inversion model the main conclusions were drawn as follows 1 the effects of moisture salinity and moisture salinity interaction on soil spectral reflectance at wavelength of green red edge nir and swir were all significant 2 throughout the irrigation soil moisture displayed a facilitative effect on soil spectral reflectance the soil salinity had inhibitory effect on soil spectral reflectance at wavelength of green but for other wavelengths i e red edge nir and swir the effect demonstrated a tendency of transforming from inhibition into facilitation with irrigation stages proceeding the dominant factors affecting variation of soil spectral reflectance changed from soil salinity and moisture salinity interaction to soil moisture 3 reliable accuracy for estimating soil moisture salinity content with r 2 of 0 69 0 85 and rmse of 2 50 3 10 for soil moisture and r 2 of 0 84 0 90 and rmse of 0 20 0 26 for soil salinity was achieved dynamic changes of soil moisture salinity content average value of soil moisture increased from 13 40 to 15 18 and average value of soil salinity decreased from 0 97 to 0 80 caused by irrigation management can be detected timely 4 the dynamic variation of soil moisture and salinity content is valuable for water resource management in irrigation region on the one hand the amount of irrigation water should be designed to prevent soil salinization over non crop area on the other hand crop field demands timely irrigation after harvest to ensure effective salinity control declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

9589,soil moisture and salinity are both important environmental variables for crop growth in agricultural production areas optical remote sensing datasets from different sensors are available for estimating soil moisture and salinity from different spatial temporal scales given the co regulation of soil spectral reflectance sr by soil moisture and salinity the simultaneous estimation of moisture and salinity in saline soil may result in great bias and uncertainty to address this problem soil samples were collected in the salinized area during irrigation synchronously processed multi spectral images were acquired from sentinel 2 satellite the spectrum mechanism responsive to soil moisture and salinity was verified by statistical tests and its corresponding mathematical model mss model was developed to identify the dominant factors affecting sr and to inverse moisture and salinity the result showed that the effects of moisture and salinity were temporally constant facilitation and changing from inhibition to facilitation respectively during the irrigation stages the dominant factors in the variation of sr shifted from salinity and moisture salinity interaction to moisture reliable accuracy was achieved in the moisture and salinity estimation using inverse mss model the profile from the series of estimations can further reveal the dynamic changes of soil moisture and salinity content during irrigation and provide guidance for local irrigation management keywords soil salinization irrigation management remoter sensing hetao irrigation area moisture salinity

production li et al 2014 asfaw et al 2018 timely and accurate monitoring of soil moisture and salinity at regional scale contribute to the development of strategies to solve these issues relying on continuously evolved remote sensing techniques satellite remote sensing can provide reliable and effective data support for soil moisture and salinity content monitoring el hajj et al 2016 abbas et al 2013 boren and boschetti 2020 dong et al 2019 ambrosone et al 2020 the estimation of soil moisture and salinity content using optical satellite images has been investigated extensively soil salinization at a regional scale can be identified easily by rgb images composed of the reflectance in visible wavelengths i e red green and blue from optical satellite images sadeghi et al 2017 spectral reflectance of the wavelength at short wave infrared reflectance swir which is usually derived from multispectral satellites sensors e g modis landsat 8 and sentinel 2 is feasible for reflecting relative changes in soil moisture and salinity content el harti et al 2016 rahimzadeh bajgiran et al 2013 by combining the swir with land surface temperature lst the soil moisture content can be quantified by the empirical modeling methods based on semi physical mechanism sadeghi et al 2017 bazzi et al 2020 the spectral reflectance at wavelengths of red and near infrared nir usually falls in the spectrum boundaries fixed by a series of feature parameters these parameters are demonstrated as promising proxies for indicating soil properties amani et al 2016 for example urban et al 2018 input these parameters to an inversion model to detect the spatial temporal variation of soil moisture content across different seasons over southern kruger national park where annual drought was evident owing to the discrepancy on relationships between the soil moisture salinity and their corresponding spectral reflectance at wavelengths ranging from visible to swir the reasonable selection of wavelengths is needed before modeling el harti et al 2016 moreover the availability of spectral indexes and learning machine techniques in a modeling process has turned out to be useful for more reliable estimation for example wang et al 2019 constructed a soil salinity inversion model with machine learning techniques and optimal combination of spectral indexes to monitor the dynamic changes of soil salinity in dry and wet seasons over ebinur lake region xinjiang china as is mentioned above estimating soil moisture or salinity content using optical data is essentially a process to quantify differentiated performance of spectral reflectance at wavelengths in this process soil moisture or salinity content is assumed to be the main even the only factor affecting the spectral reflectance generated from optical satellite images at regional scale thus this estimation may sometimes be compromised by the irrigation process where highly variable moisture and salinity content are both significant factors determining the spectral behavior at wavelengths from visible to swir lievens et al 2009 melendez pastor et al 2008 to address this issue research efforts focused on how soil spectral reflectance vary under different soil moisture salinity coexistence conditions when soil moisture and salinity content are specified the soil spectral characteristic curve can be plotted from continuous spectral reflectance obtained from analytical spectral devices e g hand held spectrometer farifteh 2011 the geometrical parameters e g a r d ma mr d of the curve can be obtained from inverse gaussian function model ig model under indoor experimental condition and considered as input variables for soil moisture or salinity content prediction in saline soil context zeng et al 2016 the semi empirical exponential model was presented to measure the responsive process of soil spectral reflectance to soil moisture and salinity in term of a physical mechanism of radiation transmission theory wang et al 2012 yang and yu 2017 this model can interpret the individual effect of soil moisture and salinity on soil spectral reflectance and allows well defined allocation of soil spectral reflectance to each factor however this model structure of binary equation with first order has inherent algorithmic weaknesses and may be insufficient to reveal the effect especially the co effect of soil moisture and salinity on soil spectral reflectance bell 1997 farifteh et al 2008 meanwhile the experimental data for these models was typically acquired from soil samples and the corresponding spectral reflectance was obtained under artificial indoor light instead of natural sunlight the results derived from ideal indoor experimental conditions may be insufficient to represent real outdoor situation xu et al 2010 xu et al 2019 schug et al 2020 yu et al 2010 in this research an extended semi empirical exponential model mss model was proposed to address the issues mentioned above the soil samples were collected during irrigation period from the hetao irrigation area which is an important grain producing region with 12500 km2 in china the soil spectral reflectance was obtained from sentinel 2 satellite the spectrum mechanism responsive for soil moisture and salinity was investigated to explore the following problems how do soil moisture and salinity act on soil spectral reflectance what is the dominant factor influencing soil spectral reflectance can soil moisture and salinity content be accurately estimated by inverse mss model 2 materials and methods 2 1

hetao irrigation area of inner mongolia autonomous region of china figure s1 the local is characterized by typical continental climate the precipitation about 158 mm for annual precipitation is much lower than evaporation about 2000 mm for annual pan evaporation which was measured by wush tv2 evaporator tianjin meteorological instrument factory china this characteristic introduces challenges into local agricultural production and development gao et al 2018 the soil type derived from field investigation is mainly clay loam composed of fine particles due to the physical structure of poor permeability clay loam is unfavorable for irrigation jia et al 2017 the crop cultivated in experimental area within the study period march june is spinach spinacia oleracea l its growing season ranges from 25 35 days from june to october the main planting crop is corn and sunflower with a growing season of 90 110 days yu and shang 2017 currently there are approximately sixty percent of the total plantation area suffering from different degrees of soil salinization posing potential threats for local agricultural production thus accurate and timely estimation of soil salinity content at regional scale is significant for developing strategies regarding the mitigation of soil salinization 2 2 collection and process for experimental data 2 2 1 acquisition and pre process of sentinel 2 satellite the multi spectral imager aboard sentinel 2 satellite can deliver optical images with fine spatial resolution i e 10 20 and 60 m covering spectral reflectance at wavelengths from visible to swir the sentinel 2 satellite archive is available from the official website of usgs its corresponding acquisition time is consistent with sampling time of soil samples table s1 a three step image processing technique is performed to generate directly available optical images with 10 m spatial resolution which involves atmospheric correction images cropping and resampling these processes were carried out using snap software released by the european space agency 2 2 2 collection and pre process of soil samples the layout of sampling sites was designed by considering local irrigation management soil properties and crop species figure s2 for each sampling site the soil sample was collected at the depth of 10 cm using five points sampling method soil moisture content smc of

equations 1 sml i smc i smc min smc max smc min 2 ssl i ssc i ssc min ssc max ssc min where smc i and ssc i represent soil moisture and salinity of i th soil samples respectively smc min and ssc min represent the minimum of soil moisture and salinity of all soil samples respectively smc max and ssc max represent the maximum of soil moisture and salinity of all soil samples respectively sml i and ssl i represent soil moisture level and soil salinity level of i th soil samples respectively 2 3 construction of land use classification model there existed obvious land vegetation alternation during the whole study period march june 2019 for each sentinel 2 observation the area involving bare soil was required to be identified and extracted by a land use classification model the modeling data for this model was derived from in situ field survey and manually labeling sentinel 2 rgb images by using the supervised method of decision tree and kennard stone algorithm land use classification model was trained iteratively until the accuracy of validation dataset was close to that of modeling dataset the detailed results regarding classification accuracy and the spatial temporal variation of land use types over the study area can be found in table s4 and figure s4 s5 respectively 2 4 spectrum mechanism responsive for soil moisture and salinity correlation analysis between soil properties sml and ssl and soil spectral reflectance at wavelengths from visible to swir was performed for statistical significance test the level of significance was defined as p 0 05 the testing result was that spectral reflectance of wavelengths at green red edge nir and swir were sensitive to both soil moisture and salinity and hereafter referred as to soil spectral reflectance table s5 the soil spectral reflectance with different soil properties were used for a series of statistical analyses variance analysis multiply compare and trend test to determine the mechanism of soil spectral reflectance responsive for soil moisture and salinity these statistical analyses were performed by anova least significant difference method lsd and mann kendall algorithms using the spss22 0 software 2 5

soil spectral reflectance without the influence of soil moisture and salinity a represents a ratio between changes of soil spectral reflectance and that of sml b represents a ratio between changes of soil spectral reflectance and that of ssl a b and r0 are related to wavelength of soil spectral reflectance the collected soil samples and processed sentinel 2 satellite images provided the variation of soil spectral reflectance as a function of soil moisture level sml and soil salinity level ssl figure s3 the observed highly nonlinear variation indicates that the existing model eq 3 may not fulfil needs for generating the accurate simulation of soil spectral reflectance under different sml and ssl compared with binary linear regression binary quadratic regression has intrinsic mathematical strength in simulation of nonlinear variation thus combining exponential function with binary quadratic regression equation may be more efficient for this demand the detailed model

model the mss model is derived from optical data at particular wavelength instead of continuous wavelengths that is the application of the mss model has less data requirements thus can be supported by numerously launched multispectral satellites meanwhile due to its flexibility to accommodate nonlinear fluctuation of soil spectral reflectance the mss model has advanced performance in estimating soil moisture and salinity content in irrigation area with strong variability of soil moisture and salinity content during irrigation period farifteh et al 2008 moreover the mss model can explicitly interpret the process of the spectral response to moisture and salinity and reveal the influencing mechanism of irrigation on soil spectral reflectance 4 2 effect of irrigation stages on moisture salinity content monitoring remote sensing based estimation of soil moisture or salinity in irrigation areas has been carried out around the world using various modeling techniques casterad et al 2018 dari et al 2020 gonzález zamora et al 2016 guo et al 2018 hajj et al 2017 han et al 2019 veysi et al 2020 welle and mauter 2017 the optimal spectral indexes from procedural selection has become a vital step in the construction of inversion models in this step the selected spectral indexes served as the input for inversion model training regardless of numerical differences of these indexes in irrigation stages in fact as is known in sections 3 1 and 3 2 there are apparent differences of spectral response mechanism in irrigation stages failure to treat these differences may distort the modeling process which is further propagated into the estimated results causing unknown bias and uncertainties accordingly the mss model without considering irrigation stages called the wmss model was developed by comparing the accuracy of the wmss model and mss model the effect of irrigation stages on the estimation in term of spectral response mechanism can be understood fig 8 during the whole process of irrigation the simulation of the wmss model demonstrated an overestimation of soil moisture content and underestimation of soil salinity content the accuracy of wmss was lower than that of the mss model the problem of reduced prediction accuracy during irrigation compares favorably with previous researches these findings indicate that the conventional modeling strategies still probably suffer from partially unreasonable prediction caused by irrigation even though they allow overall satisfying estimation with its strength in powerful generalization and robustness thus irrigation information should be thoroughly considered in the practical inversion modelling based on optical satellite data however the spatial mismatch between irrigation information irrigation stages at regional scale and optical data spectral reflectance at field scale may cause additional uncertainty when irrigation information is used as an input for the inversion model thus the spatially fine resolution observation of irrigation information is crucial to the extensive application of the mss model the irrigation information can be determined according to the relative difference of soil surface roughness in irrigation stages due to the hydraulic properties of irrigation water due to the high sensitivity of synthetic aperture radar sar signal to soil surface characteristics sar e g sentinel 1 has great potential in identifying irrigation information at field scale baghdadi et al 2018 bazzi et al 2020 ullmann and stauch 2020 thus the applicability of sentinel 1 was initially assessed by associating the vv backscatters of sentinel 1 with proportional contributions of each factor i e moisture salinity and moisture salinity interaction to soil spectral reflectance fig 10 the observed aggregation phenomena of vh backscatters represents the distribution pattern of proportional contributions of key factors to some extent for example for swir the proportional contribution of soil moisture displayed an increasing tendency with vh backscatter increase however this tendency was not statistically significant due to a degree of the overlap of proportional contribution among vh backscatters for this the relationship between the signal from sar and spectral response mechanism should be further investigated in the future 4 3 effect of land vegetation alternation on soil moisture and salinity content the variation of soil moisture and salinity content over the study area is not only closely related to the irrigation management but also the land vegetation alternation feng et al 2005 zhao et al 2014 a typical area with high frequency of land vegetation alternation figure s5 was chosen from the study area and used for the study of the effect of the land vegetation alternation on soil moisture and salinity content fig 9 compared with bare soil the water loss in crop field is relatively lower due to the lower evaporation capacity of vegetation so the crop field has higher soil moisture content than bare soil this phenomenon exists in the non irrigated area e g the iv region in fig 9d e and it will gradually disappear with the re distribution of soil moisture content caused by persistent strong evaporation e g the vi region in fig 10 c d meanwhile the gap of moisture content between the crop field and bare soil diminishes after irrigation e g the i region in fig 9b c without irrigation aggregation of soil salinity can be observed after crop harvesting e g the iv region in fig 9i j the timely and efficient irrigation helps to mitigate the aggregation of soil salinity e g the iv region in fig 9f g in general reasonable irrigation of crop field can contribute to the soil salinization management in the determination of irrigation quota both crop water requirement and groundwater depth should be taken into consideration so as to avoid aggravation of soil salinity after crop harvesting this area also needs timely irrigation otherwise salinity control will be hindered and the cultivation time for subsequent crop will be delayed 5 conclusion currently the simultaneous estimation of soil moisture and salinity content using optical data suffers from low prediction accuracy to overcome this limitation the mechanism of soil spectral reflectance responsive to soil moisture and salinity was explored and used for the construction of inversion model the main conclusions were drawn as follows 1 the effects of moisture salinity and moisture salinity interaction on soil spectral reflectance at wavelength of green red edge nir and swir were all significant 2 throughout the irrigation soil moisture displayed a facilitative effect on soil spectral reflectance the soil salinity had inhibitory effect on soil spectral reflectance at wavelength of green but for other wavelengths i e red edge nir and swir the effect demonstrated a tendency of transforming from inhibition into facilitation with irrigation stages proceeding the dominant factors affecting variation of soil spectral reflectance changed from soil salinity and moisture salinity interaction to soil moisture 3 reliable accuracy for estimating soil moisture salinity content with r 2 of 0 69 0 85 and rmse of 2 50 3 10 for soil moisture and r 2 of 0 84 0 90 and rmse of 0 20 0 26 for soil salinity was achieved dynamic changes of soil moisture salinity content average value of soil moisture increased from 13 40 to 15 18 and average value of soil salinity decreased from 0 97 to 0 80 caused by irrigation management can be detected timely 4 the dynamic variation of soil moisture and salinity content is valuable for water resource management in irrigation region on the one hand the amount of irrigation water should be designed to prevent soil salinization over non crop area on the other hand crop field demands timely irrigation after harvest to ensure effective salinity control declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial
