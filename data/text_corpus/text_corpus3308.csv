the production of iron sludge still restrict their practical application here a self regenerable bio hybrid consisting of bacterial cells and self assembled bio fes was developed to efficiently remove chromium cr vi a dense layer of bio fes was distributed on the cell surface and in the periplasmic space of shewanella oneidensis mr 1 endowing the bacterium with good cr vi tolerance and unusual activity for bio fes mediated cr vi reduction an artificial transmembrane electron channel was constituted by the bio fes to facilitate extracellular electron pumping enabling efficient regeneration of extracellular bio fes for continuous cr vi reduction the bio hybrid maintained high activity within three consecutive treatment regeneration cycles for treating both simulated cr vi containing

oneidensis mr 1 s oneidensis mr 1 was incubated under anaerobic condition for synthesis of bio fes after 24 h incubation in the fecl3 and na2s2o3 containing medium the fe iii in the system was completely converted to fe ii fig s1a accompanied with black precipitate formation fig s1b sem image shows a dense layer of spherical nanoparticles 41 2 7 2 nm in size on the bacteria cell surface fig 1 a in contrast to the smooth surfaced cells control without bio fes synthesis fig s2 the nanoparticles represented by the bright white spots in the haadf stem image fig 1c were mainly distributed on the cell surface and a small fraction were also present in the cytomembrane and cytoplasm consistent with previous reports xiao et al 2016 yu et al 2020b in addition the nanoparticles had rich fe and s contents fig 1d with the xrd peaks corresponding to the 001 101 and 200 facets of mackinawite fes fig 1b the fe2p3 2 xps spectra fig 1e and f show the presence of abundant fe ii s 707 2 ev fe ii o 709 2 ev and fe iii s 711 0 ev yu et al 2020a zhang et al 2021c while the s2p spectra reveal obvious signals of s2 s2 2 and polysulfides sn 2 yu et al 2020a 2020b all these results confirm the successful synthesis of bio fes by s oneidensis mr 1 fig s3 3 2 cr vi removal performance of the bio hybrid the establishment of a bio hybrid requires not only physical co presence but also a synergetic functioning between the nanoparticles and living cells we evaluated the performance of the biohybrid bacterial cells with bio fes shell for removing cr vi initial concentration of 50 mg l the bio hybrid achieved 97 8 1 0 cr vi removal within 2 h far outperforming the pure cells control fig 2a notably the heat killed bio hybrid still showed as high as 83 7 0 9 cr vi removal within 2 h indicating that the cr vi removal was mainly ascribed to chemical reduction adsorption by the bio fes the slightly enhanced cr vi removal by all the living cell groups over the heat killed controls indicate that bacterial reduction also played a minor part in the cr vi removal apparently the bio fes can work synergistically with the bacteria for cr vi removal indicating a successful construction of the bio hybrid in our system the sustained bacterial activity of the bio hybrid for cr vi reduction was supported by the cell viability analysis after 50 mg l cr vi treatment the pure cells without bio fes became almost all dead fig 2 b due to high cr vi toxicity belchik sara et al 2011 li et al 2020a while the bio hybrid still remained 51 4 cell viability fig 2c indicating that the bio fes can serve as a protective shell for the cells to significantly enhance their resistance to cr vi toxicity and endows the bio hybrid with sustained activity for cr vi removal 3 3 microbial driven bio fes regeneration for enhanced cr vi removal attributed the high activity and self generation of bio fes efficient removal of cr vi initial concentration 50 mg l was achieved in the bio hybrid system during three consecutive batch cycles fig 3 b the cr vi concentration rapidly declined to zero within 5 h accompanied with simultaneously decreased fe ii and increased fe iii contents interestingly after the cr vi was fully removed the fe ii content in the system gradually increased and the fe iii content declined these results suggest that the bio fes was rapidly consumed for cr vi reduction but was gradually regenerated after cr vi depletion such cyclic bio fes consumption and regeneration process coincides well with the dynamic changes in fe ii fe iii concentrations and medium color fig 3a and c and is also validated by the mass balance analysis of the elemental fe and s in the reaction system at different stages of the bio fes synthesis and cr vi removal fig 3d e the xps analysis of the collected precipitates during the cyclic cr vi removal process provides further evidence for the dynamic consumption and in situ regeneration of bio fes in the first batch cycle after 5 h reaction cr vi was reduced to cr iii mainly in the forms of c2o3 and cr oh 3 fig 4 a while fe ii was predominantly converted to fe iii accounting for 94 8 of the total fe content fig 4b and the s2 content decreased drastically this process corresponds to the process of bio fes oxidation coupled with cr vi reduction after cr vi depletion the fe ii and s2 contents was significantly raised to a level comparable to the those in the original bio fes figs 1 and 4 indicating an efficient regeneration of bio fes this self regeneration ability renders the bio hybrid sustained high activity for repeated cr vi removal in three consecutive batch cycles however the cr vi removal performance declined obviously in the 4th cycle mainly due to suppressed cell activity under the continuous high concentration cr vi stress figs s4 and s5 and accumulation of inert cr2o3 cr oh 3 and fe oh 3 precipitates on the cell surface fig s6 which impairs the regeneration of extracellular bio fes to address these issues we tested two strategies to restore the bio hybrid activity in the first strategy the biohybrid was rinsed with edta and pbs solution to remove the inert precipitate on cell surface and then incubated in fresh culture medium to re synthesize bio fes after the solution color turned from grayish yellow to dark black indicative of bio fes formation fig 5 a the regenerated bio hybrid was used for cr vi removal exhibiting comparable activity and stability with the pristine system fig 5b in the second strategy we directly regenerated the bio fes by simply replenishing fresh bacteria and incubating the cells in cr free medium after 40 h incubation the regenerated bio hybrid with dark black solution color fig 5a also restored its activity for cr vi removal fig 5c the above strategies may be readily applied in practical wastewater facilities through sludge recirculation and in situ bacteria replenishment to ensure sustained activity of the bio hybrid 3 4 regeneration mechanisms and roles of bio fes in the bio hybrid bio fes regeneration is the key to sustained activity of the bio hybrid in our system we show that s0 the oxidation products of bio fes can be directly utilized by the bacterium to produce h2s for bio fes synthesis fig s7 consistent with the literature report flynn et al 2014 zhang et al 2021b here the extracellular sn 2 and s0 may enter into the cells and be reduced into h2s by the periplasmic sulfur reduction systems psrcba sirdca choi and lee 2020 hinsley and berks 2002 meanwhile the formed fe iii oxides during cr vi reduction can also be reduced extracellularly by the bacterium to generate fe ii shi et al 2016 which immediately react with the newly generated h2s to form bio fes therefore after cr vi treatment the bio fes can be in situ regenerated from the oxidation products rather than be re synthesized from externally added thiosulfate precursors fig s8 although the later process may be employed to accelerate the bio hybrid activity restoration notably apart from mediating the extracellular cr vi reduction the bio fes also constitutes an artificial electron channel across the cell membrane to boost bacterial extracellular electron transfer eet jiang et al 2014 li et al 2021 yu et al 2020b thereby further enhancing bio fes regeneration and cr vi reduction the bio fes induced eet enhancement was verified by the mo reduction experiment mo was selected here because it is can only be extracellularly reduced by s oneidensis and this process is not interfered by fes fig s9 the 4 fold higher activity for mo reduction of the bio hybrid confirms its improved eet ability over pure cells such eet enhancement should be attributed to electron conduit role played by the bio fes as can be seen from the mo reduction tests by different bacteria fig 6 the s oneidensis mutants deficient in eet related genes show severely suppressed activity relative to the wt but the activities are partially restored or even drastically increased in the bio hybrid depending on position of the deleted c type cytochromes indicating that the formed bio fes can substitute the missing c type cytochromes in the eet chain or even create new eet pathways in the bacterium overall with the co presence of bio fes the cr vi reduction pathways in s oneidensis mr 1 is fundamentally changed and the activity drastically enhanced for the pure bacterial cells cr vi is mainly reduced intracellularly gang et al 2019 and the c type cytochromes on cell surface also has a minor contribution to cr vi removal belchik sara et al 2011 wang et al 2013 fig 7 a in such biological system the bacterial activity is severely suppressed due to cr vi toxicity in contrast for the bio hybrid an extracellular reduction of cr vi reduction mediated by bio fes becomes predominant fig 7b and the bio fes plays dual roles in this system the bio fes on cell surface enables more efficient cr vi reduction than biological process and effectively protect the encapsulated cells from the toxic cr vi stress while the membrane embedded bio fes drastically enhances the bacterial eet to drive an efficient regeneration of the bio fes thereby endowing the bio hybrid with self regeneration ability and sustained activity for treating high concentration cr vi wastewater 3 5 performance of the bio hybrid for treating real electroplating wastewater to validate the practical application potential of the bio hybrid we tested its performance for treating real electroplating wastewater that contains high level heavy metals including cr6 zn2 and cu2 similar to the above results of cyclic cr vi removal almost complete cr vi removal from the electroplating wastewater was achieved within 5 hours during the first three cycles and 97 removal was still achieved in the 4th cycle fig 8 in addition the concentrations of zn2 and cu2 decreased to 1 04 0 02 mg l and 0 09 0 01 mg l respectively all meeting the discharge limits in china interestingly the bio hybrid also exhibited significantly higher activity than pure cells for roxarsone a common antibiotics degradation fig s11 implying a great potential of the self regenerable bio hybrid for treating cr vi rich electroplating wastewater and other recalcitrant wastewaters nevertheless the bio hybrid activity would gradually decline over prolonged operation hence appropriate regulation strategies for its activity restoration may be regularly applied to ensure sustained high activity of the bio hybrid system in practical application optimal operating conditions should also be afforded for example wastewater with over high metal concentration e g 100 mg l cr vi would still severely suppress the bacterial activity of the bio hybrid fig s10 and the eet ability of the bacterium can be drastically impaired under low ph and temperature conditions cao et al 2013 overall the bio hybrid in our system is in essence bacteria decorated with regenerable bio fes nanoparticles and hence its optimal functioning relies on appropriate environmental and operational conditions such as moderate temperature neutral ph and anaerobic environment should also be afforded which may be accomplished by pretreatment approaches like ph neutralization wastewater dilution and pre precipitation for the same reason the bio hybrid may be facilely adapted to the existing anaerobic biotechnologies such as upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor anaerobic fluidized bed reactor and sequencing batch reactor where the sludge activity may be regularly restored through partial sludge recirculation or in situ bio augmentation for bio fes regeneration re synthesis 4 conclusion a self regenerable bio hybrid consisting of s oneidensis cells and self assembled fes nanoparticles was constructed and used for efficient removal of high concentration cr vi the bio fes shell of the cells plays a key role in mediating the extracellular reduction of cr vi and protecting the encapsulated cells from toxic cr vi while the membrane embedded bio fes constitutes an efficient eet pathway to accelerate electron efflux for extracellular bio fes regeneration and cr vi reduction the bio fes regeneration in situ is enabled by the microbial activity for efficiently reducing the major sulfur and fe oxidation products during cr vi i e s0 sn 2 and fe iii oxides the bio hybrid maintains high reduction activity during cyclic cr vi removal allows efficient activity restoration in situ and exhibits good performance for treating real electroplating wastewater indicating a great potential for practical wastewater

oneidensis mr 1 s oneidensis mr 1 was incubated under anaerobic condition for synthesis of bio fes after 24 h incubation in the fecl3 and na2s2o3 containing medium the fe iii in the system was completely converted to fe ii fig s1a accompanied with black precipitate formation fig s1b sem image shows a dense layer of spherical nanoparticles 41 2 7 2 nm in size on the bacteria cell surface fig 1 a in contrast to the smooth surfaced cells control without bio fes synthesis fig s2 the nanoparticles represented by the bright white spots in the haadf stem image fig 1c were mainly distributed on the cell surface and a small fraction were also present in the cytomembrane and cytoplasm consistent with previous reports xiao et al 2016 yu et al 2020b in addition the nanoparticles had rich fe and s contents fig 1d with the xrd peaks corresponding to the 001 101 and 200 facets of mackinawite fes fig 1b the fe2p3 2 xps spectra fig 1e and f show the presence of abundant fe ii s 707 2 ev fe ii o 709 2 ev and fe iii s 711 0 ev yu et al 2020a zhang et al 2021c while the s2p spectra reveal obvious signals of s2 s2 2 and polysulfides sn 2 yu et al 2020a 2020b all these results confirm the successful synthesis of bio fes by s oneidensis mr 1 fig s3 3 2 cr vi removal performance of the bio hybrid the establishment of a bio hybrid requires not only physical co presence but also a synergetic functioning between the nanoparticles and living cells we evaluated the performance of the biohybrid bacterial cells with bio fes shell for removing cr vi initial concentration of 50 mg l the bio hybrid achieved 97 8 1 0 cr vi removal within 2 h far outperforming the pure cells control fig 2a notably the heat killed bio hybrid still showed as high as 83 7 0 9 cr vi removal within 2 h indicating that the cr vi removal was mainly ascribed to chemical reduction adsorption by the bio fes the slightly enhanced cr vi removal by all the living cell groups over the heat killed controls indicate that bacterial reduction also played a minor part in the cr vi removal apparently the bio fes can work synergistically with the bacteria for cr vi removal indicating a successful construction of the bio hybrid in our system the sustained bacterial activity of the bio hybrid for cr vi reduction was supported by the cell viability analysis after 50 mg l cr vi treatment the pure cells without bio fes became almost all dead fig 2 b due to high cr vi toxicity belchik sara et al 2011 li et al 2020a while the bio hybrid still remained 51 4 cell viability fig 2c indicating that the bio fes can serve as a protective shell for the cells to significantly enhance their resistance to cr vi toxicity and endows the bio hybrid with sustained activity for cr vi removal 3 3 microbial driven bio fes regeneration for enhanced cr vi removal attributed the high activity and self generation of bio fes efficient removal of cr vi initial concentration 50 mg l was achieved in the bio hybrid system during three consecutive batch cycles fig 3 b the cr vi concentration rapidly declined to zero within 5 h accompanied with simultaneously decreased fe ii and increased fe iii contents interestingly after the cr vi was fully removed the fe ii content in the system gradually increased and the fe iii content declined these results suggest that the bio fes was rapidly consumed for cr vi reduction but was gradually regenerated after cr vi depletion such cyclic bio fes consumption and regeneration process coincides well with the dynamic changes in fe ii fe iii concentrations and medium color fig 3a and c and is also validated by the mass balance analysis of the elemental fe and s in the reaction system at different stages of the bio fes synthesis and cr vi removal fig 3d e the xps analysis of the collected precipitates during the cyclic cr vi removal process provides further evidence for the dynamic consumption and in situ regeneration of bio fes in the first batch cycle after 5 h reaction cr vi was reduced to cr iii mainly in the forms of c2o3 and cr oh 3 fig 4 a while fe ii was predominantly converted to fe iii accounting for 94 8 of the total fe content fig 4b and the s2 content decreased drastically this process corresponds to the process of bio fes oxidation coupled with cr vi reduction after cr vi depletion the fe ii and s2 contents was significantly raised to a level comparable to the those in the original bio fes figs 1 and 4 indicating an efficient regeneration of bio fes this self regeneration ability renders the bio hybrid sustained high activity for repeated cr vi removal in three consecutive batch cycles however the cr vi removal performance declined obviously in the 4th cycle mainly due to suppressed cell activity under the continuous high concentration cr vi stress figs s4 and s5 and accumulation of inert cr2o3 cr oh 3 and fe oh 3 precipitates on the cell surface fig s6 which impairs the regeneration of extracellular bio fes to address these issues we tested two strategies to restore the bio hybrid activity in the first strategy the biohybrid was rinsed with edta and pbs solution to remove the inert precipitate on cell surface and then incubated in fresh culture medium to re synthesize bio fes after the solution color turned from grayish yellow to dark black indicative of bio fes formation fig 5 a the regenerated bio hybrid was used for cr vi removal exhibiting comparable activity and stability with the pristine system fig 5b in the second strategy we directly regenerated the bio fes by simply replenishing fresh bacteria and incubating the cells in cr free medium after 40 h incubation the regenerated bio hybrid with dark black solution color fig 5a also restored its activity for cr vi removal fig 5c the above strategies may be readily applied in practical wastewater facilities through sludge recirculation and in situ bacteria replenishment to ensure sustained activity of the bio hybrid 3 4 regeneration mechanisms and roles of bio fes in the bio hybrid bio fes regeneration is the key to sustained activity of the bio hybrid in our system we show that s0 the oxidation products of bio fes can be directly utilized by the bacterium to produce h2s for bio fes synthesis fig s7 consistent with the literature report flynn et al 2014 zhang et al 2021b here the extracellular sn 2 and s0 may enter into the cells and be reduced into h2s by the periplasmic sulfur reduction systems psrcba sirdca choi and lee 2020 hinsley and berks 2002 meanwhile the formed fe iii oxides during cr vi reduction can also be reduced extracellularly by the bacterium to generate fe ii shi et al 2016 which immediately react with the newly generated h2s to form bio fes therefore after cr vi treatment the bio fes can be in situ regenerated from the oxidation products rather than be re synthesized from externally added thiosulfate precursors fig s8 although the later process may be employed to accelerate the bio hybrid activity restoration notably apart from mediating the extracellular cr vi reduction the bio fes also constitutes an artificial electron channel across the cell membrane to boost bacterial extracellular electron transfer eet jiang et al 2014 li et al 2021 yu et al 2020b thereby further enhancing bio fes regeneration and cr vi reduction the bio fes induced eet enhancement was verified by the mo reduction experiment mo was selected here because it is can only be extracellularly reduced by s oneidensis and this process is not interfered by fes fig s9 the 4 fold higher activity for mo reduction of the bio hybrid confirms its improved eet ability over pure cells such eet enhancement should be attributed to electron conduit role played by the bio fes as can be seen from the mo reduction tests by different bacteria fig 6 the s oneidensis mutants deficient in eet related genes show severely suppressed activity relative to the wt but the activities are partially restored or even drastically increased in the bio hybrid depending on position of the deleted c type cytochromes indicating that the formed bio fes can substitute the missing c type cytochromes in the eet chain or even create new eet pathways in the bacterium overall with the co presence of bio fes the cr vi reduction pathways in s oneidensis mr 1 is fundamentally changed and the activity drastically enhanced for the pure bacterial cells cr vi is mainly reduced intracellularly gang et al 2019 and the c type cytochromes on cell surface also has a minor contribution to cr vi removal belchik sara et al 2011 wang et al 2013 fig 7 a in such biological system the bacterial activity is severely suppressed due to cr vi toxicity in contrast for the bio hybrid an extracellular reduction of cr vi reduction mediated by bio fes becomes predominant fig 7b and the bio fes plays dual roles in this system the bio fes on cell surface enables more efficient cr vi reduction than biological process and effectively protect the encapsulated cells from the toxic cr vi stress while the membrane embedded bio fes drastically enhances the bacterial eet to drive an efficient regeneration of the bio fes thereby endowing the bio hybrid with self regeneration ability and sustained activity for treating high concentration cr vi wastewater 3 5 performance of the bio hybrid for treating real electroplating wastewater to validate the practical application potential of the bio hybrid we tested its performance for treating real electroplating wastewater that contains high level heavy metals including cr6 zn2 and cu2 similar to the above results of cyclic cr vi removal almost complete cr vi removal from the electroplating wastewater was achieved within 5 hours during the first three cycles and 97 removal was still achieved in the 4th cycle fig 8 in addition the concentrations of zn2 and cu2 decreased to 1 04 0 02 mg l and 0 09 0 01 mg l respectively all meeting the discharge limits in china interestingly the bio hybrid also exhibited significantly higher activity than pure cells for roxarsone a common antibiotics degradation fig s11 implying a great potential of the self regenerable bio hybrid for treating cr vi rich electroplating wastewater and other recalcitrant wastewaters nevertheless the bio hybrid activity would gradually decline over prolonged operation hence appropriate regulation strategies for its activity restoration may be regularly applied to ensure sustained high activity of the bio hybrid system in practical application optimal operating conditions should also be afforded for example wastewater with over high metal concentration e g 100 mg l cr vi would still severely suppress the bacterial activity of the bio hybrid fig s10 and the eet ability of the bacterium can be drastically impaired under low ph and temperature conditions cao et al 2013 overall the bio hybrid in our system is in essence bacteria decorated with regenerable bio fes nanoparticles and hence its optimal functioning relies on appropriate environmental and operational conditions such as moderate temperature neutral ph and anaerobic environment should also be afforded which may be accomplished by pretreatment approaches like ph neutralization wastewater dilution and pre precipitation for the same reason the bio hybrid may be facilely adapted to the existing anaerobic biotechnologies such as upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor anaerobic fluidized bed reactor and sequencing batch reactor where the sludge activity may be regularly restored through partial sludge recirculation or in situ bio augmentation for bio fes regeneration re synthesis 4 conclusion a self regenerable bio hybrid consisting of s oneidensis cells and self assembled fes nanoparticles was constructed and used for efficient removal of high concentration cr vi the bio fes shell of the cells plays a key role in mediating the extracellular reduction of cr vi and protecting the encapsulated cells from toxic cr vi while the membrane embedded bio fes constitutes an efficient eet pathway to accelerate electron efflux for extracellular bio fes regeneration and cr vi reduction the bio fes regeneration in situ is enabled by the microbial activity for efficiently reducing the major sulfur and fe oxidation products during cr vi i e s0 sn 2 and fe iii oxides the bio hybrid maintains high reduction activity during cyclic cr vi removal allows efficient activity restoration in situ and exhibits good performance for treating real electroplating wastewater indicating a great potential for practical wastewater

catchment management for improving surface water and groundwater quality in these schemes downstream water users who are impacted by agricultural diffuse pollution incentivise upstream farmers to adopt better practices however this type of scheme will not be successful in all situations in part due to a lack of potential for agriculture to improve the suuply of good water quality and or a lack in demand from downstream users for good water quality as such this study aims to present a flexible approach to mapping the potential for pes schemes to improve water quality in agricultural catchments the approach is based on multi criteria analysis with supply and demand as key criteria it uses expert judgement or current guidance on pes to select supply and demand sub criteria expert judgement to weight all criteria through pairwise comparisons and readily available national datasets to indicate criteria once indicator data are normalized it combines them in a weighted sums analysis and presents results spatially at the national scale all within a geographical information system the approach can easily be applied to the country or region of interest by using locally relevant criteria expert judgement and data for example when applied to the situation for river waterbodies in england supply sub criteria were the contribution of agriculture to loads of the major pollutants nitrogen phosphorus and sediments and demand sub criteria were the different downstream water users present water companies and tourist and local recreational users experts assigned equal weight to supply and demand criteria and the highest weights to sediments and water companies for sub criteria respectively when national scale datasets to indicate these criteria were combined in a weighted sums analysis it was possible to identify areas of high potential for pes this would hopefully motivate more detailed research at the individual catchment level into the constraints in linking supply and demand three case study schemes were also examined to show how some of these constraints are being identified and overcome as such the approach forms the first tier in a two tier

geographical information system 1 introduction diffuse pollution from agriculture remains a major problem in europe contributing to poor water quality in aquatic ecosystems with associated impacts on related goods and services on human health and on economic activities le moal et al 2019 despite this the costs of these impacts are not internalised in the purchase price of food bell et al 2018 instead governments seek to reduce the impacts of diffuse agricultural pollution on water quality through policy initiatives that aim to improve the sustainability of farming practices or change land use these publicly funded initiatives include regulation such as the nitrates directive ojec 1991 and advisory schemes such as catchment sensitive farming in the uk they also include incentive schemes such as the basic payment scheme and the republic of ireland s green low carbon agri environment scheme both funded under the eu common agricultural policy in incentive schemes government bodies pay farmers for taking up practices that are expected to improve water quality however there are several issues including funding limits low uptake by farmers in certain areas poor spatial targeting of best practices and low levels of compliance monitoring as such schemes do not always improve water quality and reduce costs or achieve policy objectives collins et al 2021 collins and anthony 2008 kay et al 2012 pulley and collins 2021 such as good ecological status ges as set by the european union water framework directive wfd ojec 2000 with poor water quality continuing to cause impacts and costs downstream users who are impacted by diffuse pollution from agriculture are increasingly looking to implement catchment management through what are often referred to as payments for ecosystem services pes schemes this is evidenced by a year on year increase in the number of pes schemes in europe coupled with an increasing private sector investment in catchment management bennett et al 2017 these schemes usually exist because the expected cost of catchment management is lower than the costs of impacts caused by poor water quality they are usually set up by downstream users themselves or by an intermediary organisation who facilitates the scheme cook et al 2017 in these schemes downstream water users buyers voluntarily incentivise upstream farmers sellers to adopt best practices featuring options for land management and or land use change as well as providing additional funds for wider catchment management these schemes tend to have higher levels of farmer enrolment practices tend to be more locally specific with better spatial targeting and there are higher levels of compliance and ecosystem service monitoring than in government incentive schemes wunder et al 2018 2008 despite these potential benefits pes is still a relatively underdeveloped component of catchment management and diffuse agricultural pollution policy in most eu member states and more specifically in the uk cook et al 2017 however interest in pes is growing due to recent opportunities to reform both eu and uk agri environmental policy bateman and balmford 2018 bieroza et al 2021 despite the possible benefits of pes the success of this approach for improving water quality will be variable with the approach more likely to succeed in some catchments than in others which is partly due to supply and demand factors table 1 for instance where the potential for agriculture to supply water quality improvements above those required by law is coupled with a high demand for the better water quality there is likely to be a high potential for pes schemes i e there needs to be a good balance of buyers and sellers of good water quality rogers et al 2015 smith et al 2013 however the potential for agriculture to improve water quality up to a certain level will be lower when other sources of pollution such as sewage treatment are present this would also make the actual effects of an agriculture focused scheme more difficult quantify through monitoring and modelling bol et al 2018 pohle et al 2017 however in those areas pes could aim to maintain a low contribution of pollutant inputs from agriculture furthermore it is more difficult and costly to solve water quality problems caused by some pollutants than others as some are subject to transformation and lag times as they move through catchments melland et al 2018 demand for good water quality may come from a range of downstream users who vary in their willingness to pay and or their technical capabilities for establishing a scheme glenk et al 2011 hampson et al 2017 in areas where there are multiple individual downstream users the use of intermediary organisations may be necessary to facilitate pes schemes cook et al 2017 and there may also be higher transaction costs associated with multiple buyers jack et al 2008 goldman benner et al 2012 since all of these supply and demand factors will vary in presence and or severity from one catchment to another so will the overall potential for pes schemes to improve water quality there are also many technical legal and economic constraints table 1 that need to be overcome in the scheme design in order to link supply and demand and realise the potential for pes to improve water quality engel et al 2008 goldman benner et al 2012 jack et al 2008 smith et al 2013 in agricultural catchments these might include technical challenges such as targeting of payments at critical source areas of the catchment that contribute the majority of pollutant loads le moal et al 2019 legal constraints such as those that discourage or prevent tenant farmers from enroling on schemes harrison mayfield et al 1998 maye et al 2009 and economic constraints such as the balance between the costs of impacts the actual budget available for catchment management and the estimated costs of improving water quality through catchment management engel et al 2008 glenk et al 2011 mapping the spatial variation in the potential for pes to improve water quality could motivate pes establishment advise on the type of schemes that might be most suitable and potentially inform policy at the strategic level although there is currently no approach or framework to do this in europe studies on deforestation and sedimentation in equatorial regions have acheived similar aims by combining readily available national scale indicator data in a multi criteria analysis mca locatelli et al 2014 wendland et al 2010 multi criteria analysis lends itself well to these strategic level studies as it allows the key aspects or criteria of a problem such as supply and demand factors to be organised in a hierarchical manner balasubramaniam and voulvoulis 2005 it can also incorporate expert judgement to weight criteria in relation to their importance which would be particularly important for criteria involving different pollutants and downstream users it also has advantages of being able to handle mixed data sets the types of which might be available at national scale to indicate those key criteria weighted data indicating the key criteria can then be parsimoniously combined and mapped arora 2012 fealy et al 2010 a mca approach should be achievable for integrating and mapping supply of and demand for good water quality in europe since there are national scale data sets available to indicate them however the very specific nature of the constraints in linking supply and demand and subsequent issues with data availability means that these would be better researched at the individual catchment level for the time being such an exercise could therefore not be expected to inform all aspects of scheme design instead it would form part of a two tier framework for establishing pes where this exercise motivates further research into pes at the individual catchment level that research would allow the constraints in linking supply and demand to be identified and the finer designs of a scheme to be detailed during a second tier this study aims to present a flexible approach to mapping the potential for pes to improve water quality in agricultural catchments the approach presented is based on mca with the potential for agriculture to increase the supply of good water quality and the demand from downstream water users for water quality improvements as key criteria it uses expert judgement or current guidance on pes to select supply and demand sub criteria expert judgement to weight criteria through pairwise comparisons and readily available national datasets to indicate criteria once indicator data are normalized it combines them in a weighted sums analysis and presents results spatially at the national scale all within a geographical information system gis this approach is applied to the situation in england to show how it can be easily tailored to the country or region of interest and where there are a number of established pes schemes against which to validate the approach three case study schemes are also examined in greater detail to show how the constraints in linking supply and demand are being identified and overcome 2 material and methods 2 1 criteria and indicators current uk guidance on pes which is based on the wider pes literature and on experiences with a number of pilot schemes defra 2016 smith et al 2013 was used to define a number of key criteria and sub criteria important in establishing a successful scheme critically this advice states that pes schemes are most likely to emerge where specific land management actions have the potential to increase the supply of a particular ecosystem service in this case water quality and there is a clear demand for the service in question sub criteria for supply and demand included the key agricultural pollutants n p and sediments for surface waters and n for groundwaters and sources of demand for drinking water and recreation respectively as identified in the guidance and pilots fig 1 these supply and demand criteria and sub criteria were considered for rivers and groundwaters separately since different pollutants stakeholders and management were present in the pilot schemes indicator data for these criteria were selected based on availability at national scale and on suitability for indicating water quality demand as outlined by wolff et al 2015 in addition to being outlined below further details on the sources formats resampling and normalisation of these datasets are presented in supplementary table s1 indicator data are also mapped in supplementary figures s1 s2 s3 and s4 all data were resampled to wfd inland river water body n 3753 and groundwater body n 271 catchment scale as this was the approximate scale at which pes pilot schemes were established this and all other data processing and analysis and mapping were carried out within a gis using arcgis pro version 2 5 and qgis software version 3 14 1 the relationship between percentage contribution of agriculture to pollutant loads actual loads in kg ha chemical and ecological change and impacts on different downstream users is extremely complex and is therefore better researched at the individual catchment level for the purposes of this study the percentage contribution that agriculture makes to pollutant loads is a simple metric that provides information about when other pollutant sources are present which could make the desired water quality improvements difficult to achieve through an agricultural pes bol et al 2018 pohle et al 2017 it would also allow for suggestions about scheme type to be made i e whether to lower the contribution or maintain low contributions from agriculture for river waterbodies modelled data on n p and sediment loads were obtained from zhang et al 2014 data for groundwater were calculated from modelled n loads leaching to groundwater from agricultural land by the neap n national scale leaching model anthony et al 1996 and from all other sources by the lerner model lerner 2000 see supplemental table s1 all three models use a range of catchment characteristics and management to model loads from agriculture and all other sources to indicate demand for drinking water and the presence of water companies it was necessary to account for abstractions that occur downstream of river waterbodies i e outside of the catchment to do this the contributing areas upstream of all environment agency licensed abstraction points were delineated this layer was then used to sum the maximum permitted abstractions ml downstream of and within each river water body catchment for groundwaters which are more hydrological independent maximum permitted abstractions ml for drinking water within each waterbody catchment were simply summed summing abstraction volumes was done on the premise that water companies would be more inclined to establish pes when large abstractions are being impacted or are at risk demand for recreational use by tourists and local populations were indicated separately as previous studies have shown recreational users within the water body catchment to have higher willingness to pay for good water quality than users from outside the catchment hampson et al 2017 indicator data were percentage of tourists visits that were specifically for outdoor recreation and population by water body catchment with both raw datasets being obtained from the national office of statistics when these indicators are high demand for good water quality for outdoor recreation are also expected to be high wolff et al 2015 indicator data for n p and sediments and water use tourist use and local use were not significantly correlated p 0 05 to suggest biases such as double accounting for criteria however data were on different scales with different distributions each dataset was therefore normalised onto a 0 1 scale either by min max scaling or by rank normalisation when data contained many zeros and or extreme values 2 2 determining weights indicator data were weighted by asking thirteen pes experts from universities water companies government organisations and non government organisations to conduct pairwise comparisons of criteria and sub criteria as outlined in analytical hierarchy process saaty 1980 saaty and vargas 1991 for instance they were asked to compare whether it is easier or harder to improve river water quality through pes for n p or sediments the three potential comparisons n vs p n vs sediments and p vs sediments were presented to the experts in a table each comparison was scored on a 9 through 1 to 1 9 scale with 9 being extremely easier 1 being equal difficulty and 1 9 being extremely harder to improve the scores assigned by the experts were entered into one half of an n p and sediment matrix and in the other half the corresponding reciprocal values were calculated and entered the matrix was then normalised by dividing each value in the matrix by the sum of values in the corresponding column the mean of the values in each row of the normalised matrix is then taken as the weight and the sum of these is always equal to 1 saaty 1980 saaty and vargas 1991 where comparisons of three or more criteria are made this approach allows for the calculation of a consistency ratio with resulting values close to zero indicating the highest consistency between comparisons ratio s above 0 1 indicate inconsistencies amongst comparisons saaty 1980 saaty and vargas 1991 experts weighted supply and demand criteria equally in both rivers and groundwaters quoting that there needs to be a good balance of buyers and sellers for a scheme to be successful which validates current guidance smith et al 2013 with more recent experiences with pes fig 1 for rivers sub criteria under supply were weighted in the order n p sediments experts commented that this reflected the transformations and lag times associated with n and to a lesser extent p transfer when compared with sediment which would make improving water quality more challenging and costly they also felt that best practices for sediment are more likely to be effective than for n and p one expert placed p more highly than n and sediments commenting that because p is an ecological quality parameter for wfd it may receive additional government support this slightly increased the consistency ratio to 0 06 which compared to values of 0 01 and 0 02 for surface water and ground water demand respectively sub criteria under demand were weighted highest for drinking water abstraction and similarly for tourist and local use for outdoor recreation in both surface water and groundwater catchments fig 1 experts felt that good water quality is generally underappreciated by the general public and that as multiple buyers are involved transaction costs would be high and an intermediary organisation would be required to facilitate a scheme they felt that impacts of poor water quality on water companies are more often due to chemical aspects rather than due to the ecological aspects that impact recreational users which are more difficult and may take longer to resolve furthermore they felt that where abstraction for drinking water is high water companies are actively looking to reduce the cost of raw water treatment through catchment management and have the funds and technical skills to establish a successful scheme in terms of hydrological setting experts felt that the slow movement of pollutants through groundwater makes it more difficult to identify the sources of pollution and would delay any water quality improvement and hence weighted rivers more highly than groundwaters 2 3 combining indicators indicators were then combined using a weighted sums analysis fig 1 which keeps data on approximately continuous scales thereby helping to maintain model resolution arora 2012 balasubramaniam and voulvoulis 2005 an important quality when dealing with such large numbers of catchments normalised indicator data for supply sub criteria were then multiplied by their respective weights depending on whether data was for groundwater bodies or river waterbodies and then summed the same process was then carried out for demand sub criteria fig 1 the resulting totals for supply and demand criteria were then multiplied by their respective weights and then the two were summed optionally the new totals can be multiplied by weights for hydrological setting the resulting values indicated the overall potential for pes to improve water quality fig 1 results were are divided into quintiles of supply demand and potential scores for river and groundwaters separately the first second third fourth and fifth quintiles indicate low medium low medium medium high and high supply demand or potential respectively while some catchments will have both high supply potential and high demand for improved water quality and lend themselves to a classic pes scheme other catchments may lack supply demand or both identifying these catchments would allow suggestions about alternative types of scheme for private sector investment in catchment management this was based on supply and demand scores for individual catchments and whether they were above or below the overall median and this was carried out for rivers and groundwaters separately these pes and alternative scheme types are defined in fig 2 2 4 validation in the absence of water quality data the approach was validated by testing the scientific hypothesis that catchments where pes are currently established or being established would contain a higher proportion of waterbodies scoring high potential or identified for pes restoration type schemes than would be present in the overall population of waterbodies this was tested on the premise that pes schemes are most likely to emerge where agriculture has the potential to increase the supply of water quality and there is a clear demand for improved water quality smith et al 2013 thirteen existing schemes containing 105 individual waterbodies were used in this validation fig 3 schemes included those in the rivers fowey western rother wicksters brook tamar wolf lyd sussex ouse evenlode middle severn and gara and in groundwaters frome and piddle upper hampshire avon and chichester chalk the proportions of waterbodies in these catchments scoring high potential were tested against the same proportion in the wider population using a two sample z test of proportions and this was repeated for waterbodies classified as suitable for pes restoration type schemes 2 5 technical legal and financial constraints in linking supply and demand three case study schemes in the south of england were examined in greater detail to show how the constraints in linking supply and demand are being identified and overcome all three schemes are case studies in the eu interreg va funded channel payments for ecosystem services project led by the university of chichester the project aims to establish pes schemes to improve water quality in the north of france and south of england for more information see https www cpes interreg eu en the three case studies used here were the river western rother in west sussex south downs groundwater in west sussex and the salcombe kingsbridge estuary in devon fig 3 they differ in hydrological setting as the river western rother and south downs groundwater both have ground and surface water hydrological components whereas being located away from principal aquifers the salcombe kingsbridge estuary is surface water dominated fig 3 the catchments also differ in supply and demand factors and in the technical legal and economic constraints in linking them and hence also have different scheme designs table 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 potential of pes for improving water quality the approach presented here is based on mca and uses expert judgement or current guidance to select criteria expert judgement to weight criteria and readily available national datasets to indicate those criteria once indicators are normalized it combines them in a weighted sums analysis and presents results spatially at the national scale all within a gis the analysis is flexible and can easily be built upon to include additional supply criteria such as pesticides bacteria metals or dissolved organic carbon and or additional demand criteria such as conservation and angling groups it can therefore also be easily applied to the country or region of interest by using locally relevant criteria expert judgement to weight those criteria and data to indicate them for example when applied to the situation for river waterbodies in england current guidance suggested that the potential for agriculture to improve the supply of good water quality for nitrogen phosphorus and sediments and the demand for improved water quality from key downstream users water companies and tourist and local recreational users should be key criteria for deciding potential readily available data were used to indicate these and expert judgement using pairwise comparisons assigned equal weight to supply and demand criteria and the highest weights to sediments and water companies for sub criteria respectively when combined in a weighted sums analysis it was possible to identify areas with high potential for pes and these results are presented in figs 4 and 5 for rivers high potential areas include the north and west of the country where the varied topography suits surface water collection and storage for drinking purposes whereas for groundwaters these areas were in the south east of the country where principal bedrock aquifers are present and there is a greater water company reliance on them as drinking water sources ea 2012 however as with mca in general the results are highly influenced by the selection of criteria and sub criteria balasubramaniam and voulvoulis 2005 and it is possible that results would follow a different spatial pattern when other pollutants or types of downstream users are included an alternative way of selecting comprehensive criteria and sub criteria would be to draw on expert judgement and this has been used with great success in other mca analyses e g bampa et al 2019 the main difference between this approach and the ones presented in similar studies is the focus here on private sector investment in catchment management through small scale pes schemes because of this focus it has been essential to weight criteria especially for demand as different downstream users vary greatly in their willingness to pay upstream farmers and in their abilities to set up a scheme this is compared to previous approaches that are mainly concerned with identifying areas for government investment in catchment management through national scale schemes where weighting may not have been so important e g locatelli et al 2014 wendland et al 2010 when applied to the situation in the england the approach was able to utilise high quality data compared to previous studies in data sparse areas e g burkhard et al 2012 vrebos et al 2015 this is due the catchment science specific high resolution data recently available in this country for instance supply indicators involved detailed modelling of pollutant loads to rivers and groundwaters for all waterbody catchments zhang et al 2014 indicating demand involved combining abstraction volumes with areas upstream of abstraction points which allowed water use downstream of the waterbody catchments to also be included as with many supply and demand mapping studies some aspects were constrained by data availability wolff et al 2015 and this would likely be the case when the approach is applied to more data sparse areas or countries pohle et al 2021 vrebos et al 2015 for example this study indicates demand from tourists for recreation using the percentage of tourist visits for outdoor recreation purposes this does not directly indicate use of the waterbodies for recreation because outdoor recreation does not always involve water while the willingness to pay of local and tourist recreational users for improved water quality has been accurately estimated for individual waterbodies glenk et al 2011 hampson et al 2017 an exercise to extrapolate those results to the national scale would very valuable for improving the mapping results in the future if the approach is to be considered at all accurate then catchments where pes are currently established or being established would contain a higher proportion of waterbodies scoring high potential than would be present in the overall population of waterbodies this was indeed the case with 65 of waterbodies within the catchments where pes are currently being established scoring high potential compared to 20 in the overall population significantly different to p 0 0001 these proportions were not expected to reach 100 since not all factors were included in the analysis and because pes is often targeted at problematic waterbodies within the wider catchment area of the scheme and these were not always known this validation would be further strengthened by water quality improvement data from the schemes when it becomes available this validation exercise also shows how pes schemes are already starting to emerge in a small proportion of high potential waterbodies and this mapping study could further motivate that proliferation even though the target pollutants and scale of these schemes will not always be aligned with the wfd a water quality improvement at any level should be a welcome contribution to achieving ges the current agricultural policy reforms happening in europe must ensure adaptation of policy to accommodate this new wave of catchment management 3 2 type of schemes to improve water quality the approach was also validated based on the scientific hypothesis that catchments where pes are currently established or being established would contain a higher proportion of waterbodies identified as suitable for pes restoration type schemes than would be present in the overall population of waterbodies indeed 76 of waterbodies within catchments where pes schemes are being or have been established were identified as being suitable for pes restoration type schemes compared to 25 in the overall population significantly different to p 0 0001 the situation where water companies are incentivising upstream farmers to adopt better practices because they are being impacted by diffuse pollution or pes restoration type schemes are the most common types of scheme found in england however there are alternative options for private sector investment in catchment management for when supply potential demand or both are lacking to suggest alternative types the mapping approach further classifies catchments as being best suited to either pes protection community restoration or community protection type schemes this is based on whether their scores for supply and demand are above or below the overall median and this was carried out for rivers and groundwaters separately figs 4 5 the pes protection type schemes would be best suited to catchments with high water company demand but low potential for agriculture to improve the supply of good water quality such areas include the thames basin upstream of london where sources other than agriculture are more important for water quality figs 4 5 however these schemes may still be important as they can provide protection when external forces such as the agricultural intensification bought about by the abolition of eu milk quotas groeneveld et al 2016 or climate change ockenden et al 2017 threaten to increase agricultural diffuse pollution as such water companies would establish these schemes for risk management since they aim to eliminate future impacts and associated costs of water treatment catchments with high supply but low demand scores where community restoration schemes are more suited are mainly located around the fringes of the country figs 4 5 these schemes would likely require an intermediary organisation to effectively facilitate payments from multiple individuals and businesses to farmers cook et al 2017 engel et al 2008 these intermediaries may play a number of roles including introducing downstream users and farmers and building rapport between them establishing water quality baselines identifying best practices that will improve water quality assisting in determining prices accessing grants structuring agreements and agreeing a mutually acceptable payment regime performing activities related to implementation including monitoring certification verification etc and overall scheme administration cook et al 2017 smith et al 2013 these activities cannot be conducted without cost and one example of how policy might be adapted to accommodate pes is to channel more government funding towards the facilitation of these community type schemes either by regulatory bodies or environmental charities if the budget available for incentivising practice and or land use change is not sufficient to improve water quality intermediaries may also seek additional private sector funds from outside the catchment for example from companies looking to offset their carbon emissions in catchments with low supply and demand externally funded protective schemes may look similar except with the aim to ensure the inputs of pollutants from agriculture kept low 3 3 technical legal and financial constraints in linking supply and demand this mapping approach allowed for some basic supply and demand barriers to be identified in advance see supplementary table s2 and these barriers were confirmed by more detailed research within each catchment table 2 however it could not be expected to identify the catchment specific constraints in linking supply and demand instead the downstream users or intermediary organisations establishing a scheme would carry out thorough research to understand their catchments and design the scheme in detail in the case study schemes this research involved gathering existing data monitoring modelling field experiments cost benefit analysis stakeholder analysis and mapping and stakeholder engagement amongst others these constraints included technical challenges such as targeting of payments at critical source areas of the catchment that contribute the majority of pollutant loads legal constraints such as those that discourage or prevent tenant farmers from enroling on schemes and economic constraints such as the balance between the costs that impacts are creating the actual budget available for catchment management and the estimated costs of improving water quality through catchment management table 2 in the south downs groundwater scheme combined monitoring and modelling by the water company identified a gradual increasing trend in nitrate concentrations at their groundwater boreholes as water moves slowly through the chalk matrix 1 m yr 1 this trend is overlain by a series of spikes which they proved through tracer experiments to be due to rapid transfer of n through fissures in the chalk in response to rainfall events stuart et al 2016 the water company identified all fields overlying these fissures and plan to target payments for arable reversion to low input grassland on them to address the n spikes they will also incentivise widespread adoption of cover crops in attempt to halt any increase in the longer term trend farmers on short term tenancy agreements or farmers whose landlord determines any interaction with agri environment schemes may be less likely to enrol on these types of schemes harrison mayfield et al 1998 maye et al 2009 this has been the case particularly in the western rother catchment where despite over 50 years of research into erosion and management the issue remains unresolved boardman 2016 boardman et al 2009 farres et al 1990 to encourage adoption of practices the water company operating in this catchment are working with farmers to co design a scheme to ensure practices are financially attractive and compatible with the farming systems present they are also working with land owners to have certain practices written into farm tenancy agreements understanding the costs that water quality impacts are creating relative to the costs of incentivising enough practices to improve water quality can be key to designing a successful pes scheme for instance in the south downs groundwater scheme it was important for the water company s catchment management team to demonstrate this to be able to secure internal funding for pes through their modelling work they demonstrated that incentivising farmers in a pes scheme would cost 3 3 m to achieve the desired affect by 2075 this is compared to the 8 m cost of setting up and running a nitrate removal plant over the same timescale giving a net benefit of 4 7 m a clear case for pes restoration such a quantitative assessment is not always necessary in the salcombe kingsbridge estuary scheme it was quite clear to the westcountry rivers trust wrt the intermediary organisation establishing a community restoration type scheme that funds generated within the catchment would not be sufficient to improve water quality the multiple individual or small business buyers that are present here are generally supportive of the concept of catchment management however previous schemes have found them difficult to engage rogers et al 2015 the wrt have established a trust fund to which local businesses and individuals can contribute which will reduce the costs associated with multiple transactions jack et al 2008 goldman benner et al 2012 to further boost funds they are also looking to attract external buyers who wish to offset their carbon emissions by investing in practices like tree planting that result in carbon sequestration they will distribute the funds to farmers in exchange for practice or land use change either through one to one visits with a wrt advisor to negotiate grant funding or through a reverse auction system in the auction system farmers bid for funds and the bids likely to deliver the greatest impacts on water quality are funded making any actions more cost effective valcu lisman et al 2017 the wrt are also involved in several of the other schemes mentioned in section 2 4 such as those in the river tamar catchment these are just a few of the design considerations made in the case study schemes in order to link supply and demand and realise pes potential they also made many of the frequently cited design considerations such as how the scheme will provide additional protection or restoration for water quality above what is already present and how the payments will be conditional on implementation of practices engel et al 2008 wunder et al 2018 the channel payments for ecosystem services project will bring together experiences from these schemes and from three other schemes in northern france to provide up to date guidance specific to catchment management for designing pes in this second tier 4 conclusion this study presents an approach to mapping the potential for pes to improve water quality in agricultural catchments the approach is based on mca with the potential for agriculture to increase the supply of good water quality and the demand from downstream water users for water quality improvements included as key criteria the approach involves the following steps 1 select supply and demand sub criteria using expert judgement or current guidance on pes 2 weight criteria using expert judgement through pairwise comparisons 3 indicate criteria with readily available national datasets 4 normalise indicators using appropriate techniques 5 combine indicators in a weighted sums analysis 6 present results at the national scale this approach can easily be applied to the country or region of interest by using locally relevant criteria expert judgement and data when applied to the situation in england it was possible to identify areas of high potential which would hopefully motivate more detailed research at the individual catchment level into the constraints in linking supply and demand this approach also allows for some basic barriers to pes to be identified and suggestions for alternative types of schemes to be made furthermore by simultaneously assessing the current state of pes in england it was possible to make some initial policy recommendations specifically this was that policy must be adapted to accommodate this new wave of catchment management one way that this might happen is for some government funding

catchment management for improving surface water and groundwater quality in these schemes downstream water users who are impacted by agricultural diffuse pollution incentivise upstream farmers to adopt better practices however this type of scheme will not be successful in all situations in part due to a lack of potential for agriculture to improve the suuply of good water quality and or a lack in demand from downstream users for good water quality as such this study aims to present a flexible approach to mapping the potential for pes schemes to improve water quality in agricultural catchments the approach is based on multi criteria analysis with supply and demand as key criteria it uses expert judgement or current guidance on pes to select supply and demand sub criteria expert judgement to weight all criteria through pairwise comparisons and readily available national datasets to indicate criteria once indicator data are normalized it combines them in a weighted sums analysis and presents results spatially at the national scale all within a geographical information system the approach can easily be applied to the country or region of interest by using locally relevant criteria expert judgement and data for example when applied to the situation for river waterbodies in england supply sub criteria were the contribution of agriculture to loads of the major pollutants nitrogen phosphorus and sediments and demand sub criteria were the different downstream water users present water companies and tourist and local recreational users experts assigned equal weight to supply and demand criteria and the highest weights to sediments and water companies for sub criteria respectively when national scale datasets to indicate these criteria were combined in a weighted sums analysis it was possible to identify areas of high potential for pes this would hopefully motivate more detailed research at the individual catchment level into the constraints in linking supply and demand three case study schemes were also examined to show how some of these constraints are being identified and overcome as such the approach forms the first tier in a two tier

geographical information system 1 introduction diffuse pollution from agriculture remains a major problem in europe contributing to poor water quality in aquatic ecosystems with associated impacts on related goods and services on human health and on economic activities le moal et al 2019 despite this the costs of these impacts are not internalised in the purchase price of food bell et al 2018 instead governments seek to reduce the impacts of diffuse agricultural pollution on water quality through policy initiatives that aim to improve the sustainability of farming practices or change land use these publicly funded initiatives include regulation such as the nitrates directive ojec 1991 and advisory schemes such as catchment sensitive farming in the uk they also include incentive schemes such as the basic payment scheme and the republic of ireland s green low carbon agri environment scheme both funded under the eu common agricultural policy in incentive schemes government bodies pay farmers for taking up practices that are expected to improve water quality however there are several issues including funding limits low uptake by farmers in certain areas poor spatial targeting of best practices and low levels of compliance monitoring as such schemes do not always improve water quality and reduce costs or achieve policy objectives collins et al 2021 collins and anthony 2008 kay et al 2012 pulley and collins 2021 such as good ecological status ges as set by the european union water framework directive wfd ojec 2000 with poor water quality continuing to cause impacts and costs downstream users who are impacted by diffuse pollution from agriculture are increasingly looking to implement catchment management through what are often referred to as payments for ecosystem services pes schemes this is evidenced by a year on year increase in the number of pes schemes in europe coupled with an increasing private sector investment in catchment management bennett et al 2017 these schemes usually exist because the expected cost of catchment management is lower than the costs of impacts caused by poor water quality they are usually set up by downstream users themselves or by an intermediary organisation who facilitates the scheme cook et al 2017 in these schemes downstream water users buyers voluntarily incentivise upstream farmers sellers to adopt best practices featuring options for land management and or land use change as well as providing additional funds for wider catchment management these schemes tend to have higher levels of farmer enrolment practices tend to be more locally specific with better spatial targeting and there are higher levels of compliance and ecosystem service monitoring than in government incentive schemes wunder et al 2018 2008 despite these potential benefits pes is still a relatively underdeveloped component of catchment management and diffuse agricultural pollution policy in most eu member states and more specifically in the uk cook et al 2017 however interest in pes is growing due to recent opportunities to reform both eu and uk agri environmental policy bateman and balmford 2018 bieroza et al 2021 despite the possible benefits of pes the success of this approach for improving water quality will be variable with the approach more likely to succeed in some catchments than in others which is partly due to supply and demand factors table 1 for instance where the potential for agriculture to supply water quality improvements above those required by law is coupled with a high demand for the better water quality there is likely to be a high potential for pes schemes i e there needs to be a good balance of buyers and sellers of good water quality rogers et al 2015 smith et al 2013 however the potential for agriculture to improve water quality up to a certain level will be lower when other sources of pollution such as sewage treatment are present this would also make the actual effects of an agriculture focused scheme more difficult quantify through monitoring and modelling bol et al 2018 pohle et al 2017 however in those areas pes could aim to maintain a low contribution of pollutant inputs from agriculture furthermore it is more difficult and costly to solve water quality problems caused by some pollutants than others as some are subject to transformation and lag times as they move through catchments melland et al 2018 demand for good water quality may come from a range of downstream users who vary in their willingness to pay and or their technical capabilities for establishing a scheme glenk et al 2011 hampson et al 2017 in areas where there are multiple individual downstream users the use of intermediary organisations may be necessary to facilitate pes schemes cook et al 2017 and there may also be higher transaction costs associated with multiple buyers jack et al 2008 goldman benner et al 2012 since all of these supply and demand factors will vary in presence and or severity from one catchment to another so will the overall potential for pes schemes to improve water quality there are also many technical legal and economic constraints table 1 that need to be overcome in the scheme design in order to link supply and demand and realise the potential for pes to improve water quality engel et al 2008 goldman benner et al 2012 jack et al 2008 smith et al 2013 in agricultural catchments these might include technical challenges such as targeting of payments at critical source areas of the catchment that contribute the majority of pollutant loads le moal et al 2019 legal constraints such as those that discourage or prevent tenant farmers from enroling on schemes harrison mayfield et al 1998 maye et al 2009 and economic constraints such as the balance between the costs of impacts the actual budget available for catchment management and the estimated costs of improving water quality through catchment management engel et al 2008 glenk et al 2011 mapping the spatial variation in the potential for pes to improve water quality could motivate pes establishment advise on the type of schemes that might be most suitable and potentially inform policy at the strategic level although there is currently no approach or framework to do this in europe studies on deforestation and sedimentation in equatorial regions have acheived similar aims by combining readily available national scale indicator data in a multi criteria analysis mca locatelli et al 2014 wendland et al 2010 multi criteria analysis lends itself well to these strategic level studies as it allows the key aspects or criteria of a problem such as supply and demand factors to be organised in a hierarchical manner balasubramaniam and voulvoulis 2005 it can also incorporate expert judgement to weight criteria in relation to their importance which would be particularly important for criteria involving different pollutants and downstream users it also has advantages of being able to handle mixed data sets the types of which might be available at national scale to indicate those key criteria weighted data indicating the key criteria can then be parsimoniously combined and mapped arora 2012 fealy et al 2010 a mca approach should be achievable for integrating and mapping supply of and demand for good water quality in europe since there are national scale data sets available to indicate them however the very specific nature of the constraints in linking supply and demand and subsequent issues with data availability means that these would be better researched at the individual catchment level for the time being such an exercise could therefore not be expected to inform all aspects of scheme design instead it would form part of a two tier framework for establishing pes where this exercise motivates further research into pes at the individual catchment level that research would allow the constraints in linking supply and demand to be identified and the finer designs of a scheme to be detailed during a second tier this study aims to present a flexible approach to mapping the potential for pes to improve water quality in agricultural catchments the approach presented is based on mca with the potential for agriculture to increase the supply of good water quality and the demand from downstream water users for water quality improvements as key criteria it uses expert judgement or current guidance on pes to select supply and demand sub criteria expert judgement to weight criteria through pairwise comparisons and readily available national datasets to indicate criteria once indicator data are normalized it combines them in a weighted sums analysis and presents results spatially at the national scale all within a geographical information system gis this approach is applied to the situation in england to show how it can be easily tailored to the country or region of interest and where there are a number of established pes schemes against which to validate the approach three case study schemes are also examined in greater detail to show how the constraints in linking supply and demand are being identified and overcome 2 material and methods 2 1 criteria and indicators current uk guidance on pes which is based on the wider pes literature and on experiences with a number of pilot schemes defra 2016 smith et al 2013 was used to define a number of key criteria and sub criteria important in establishing a successful scheme critically this advice states that pes schemes are most likely to emerge where specific land management actions have the potential to increase the supply of a particular ecosystem service in this case water quality and there is a clear demand for the service in question sub criteria for supply and demand included the key agricultural pollutants n p and sediments for surface waters and n for groundwaters and sources of demand for drinking water and recreation respectively as identified in the guidance and pilots fig 1 these supply and demand criteria and sub criteria were considered for rivers and groundwaters separately since different pollutants stakeholders and management were present in the pilot schemes indicator data for these criteria were selected based on availability at national scale and on suitability for indicating water quality demand as outlined by wolff et al 2015 in addition to being outlined below further details on the sources formats resampling and normalisation of these datasets are presented in supplementary table s1 indicator data are also mapped in supplementary figures s1 s2 s3 and s4 all data were resampled to wfd inland river water body n 3753 and groundwater body n 271 catchment scale as this was the approximate scale at which pes pilot schemes were established this and all other data processing and analysis and mapping were carried out within a gis using arcgis pro version 2 5 and qgis software version 3 14 1 the relationship between percentage contribution of agriculture to pollutant loads actual loads in kg ha chemical and ecological change and impacts on different downstream users is extremely complex and is therefore better researched at the individual catchment level for the purposes of this study the percentage contribution that agriculture makes to pollutant loads is a simple metric that provides information about when other pollutant sources are present which could make the desired water quality improvements difficult to achieve through an agricultural pes bol et al 2018 pohle et al 2017 it would also allow for suggestions about scheme type to be made i e whether to lower the contribution or maintain low contributions from agriculture for river waterbodies modelled data on n p and sediment loads were obtained from zhang et al 2014 data for groundwater were calculated from modelled n loads leaching to groundwater from agricultural land by the neap n national scale leaching model anthony et al 1996 and from all other sources by the lerner model lerner 2000 see supplemental table s1 all three models use a range of catchment characteristics and management to model loads from agriculture and all other sources to indicate demand for drinking water and the presence of water companies it was necessary to account for abstractions that occur downstream of river waterbodies i e outside of the catchment to do this the contributing areas upstream of all environment agency licensed abstraction points were delineated this layer was then used to sum the maximum permitted abstractions ml downstream of and within each river water body catchment for groundwaters which are more hydrological independent maximum permitted abstractions ml for drinking water within each waterbody catchment were simply summed summing abstraction volumes was done on the premise that water companies would be more inclined to establish pes when large abstractions are being impacted or are at risk demand for recreational use by tourists and local populations were indicated separately as previous studies have shown recreational users within the water body catchment to have higher willingness to pay for good water quality than users from outside the catchment hampson et al 2017 indicator data were percentage of tourists visits that were specifically for outdoor recreation and population by water body catchment with both raw datasets being obtained from the national office of statistics when these indicators are high demand for good water quality for outdoor recreation are also expected to be high wolff et al 2015 indicator data for n p and sediments and water use tourist use and local use were not significantly correlated p 0 05 to suggest biases such as double accounting for criteria however data were on different scales with different distributions each dataset was therefore normalised onto a 0 1 scale either by min max scaling or by rank normalisation when data contained many zeros and or extreme values 2 2 determining weights indicator data were weighted by asking thirteen pes experts from universities water companies government organisations and non government organisations to conduct pairwise comparisons of criteria and sub criteria as outlined in analytical hierarchy process saaty 1980 saaty and vargas 1991 for instance they were asked to compare whether it is easier or harder to improve river water quality through pes for n p or sediments the three potential comparisons n vs p n vs sediments and p vs sediments were presented to the experts in a table each comparison was scored on a 9 through 1 to 1 9 scale with 9 being extremely easier 1 being equal difficulty and 1 9 being extremely harder to improve the scores assigned by the experts were entered into one half of an n p and sediment matrix and in the other half the corresponding reciprocal values were calculated and entered the matrix was then normalised by dividing each value in the matrix by the sum of values in the corresponding column the mean of the values in each row of the normalised matrix is then taken as the weight and the sum of these is always equal to 1 saaty 1980 saaty and vargas 1991 where comparisons of three or more criteria are made this approach allows for the calculation of a consistency ratio with resulting values close to zero indicating the highest consistency between comparisons ratio s above 0 1 indicate inconsistencies amongst comparisons saaty 1980 saaty and vargas 1991 experts weighted supply and demand criteria equally in both rivers and groundwaters quoting that there needs to be a good balance of buyers and sellers for a scheme to be successful which validates current guidance smith et al 2013 with more recent experiences with pes fig 1 for rivers sub criteria under supply were weighted in the order n p sediments experts commented that this reflected the transformations and lag times associated with n and to a lesser extent p transfer when compared with sediment which would make improving water quality more challenging and costly they also felt that best practices for sediment are more likely to be effective than for n and p one expert placed p more highly than n and sediments commenting that because p is an ecological quality parameter for wfd it may receive additional government support this slightly increased the consistency ratio to 0 06 which compared to values of 0 01 and 0 02 for surface water and ground water demand respectively sub criteria under demand were weighted highest for drinking water abstraction and similarly for tourist and local use for outdoor recreation in both surface water and groundwater catchments fig 1 experts felt that good water quality is generally underappreciated by the general public and that as multiple buyers are involved transaction costs would be high and an intermediary organisation would be required to facilitate a scheme they felt that impacts of poor water quality on water companies are more often due to chemical aspects rather than due to the ecological aspects that impact recreational users which are more difficult and may take longer to resolve furthermore they felt that where abstraction for drinking water is high water companies are actively looking to reduce the cost of raw water treatment through catchment management and have the funds and technical skills to establish a successful scheme in terms of hydrological setting experts felt that the slow movement of pollutants through groundwater makes it more difficult to identify the sources of pollution and would delay any water quality improvement and hence weighted rivers more highly than groundwaters 2 3 combining indicators indicators were then combined using a weighted sums analysis fig 1 which keeps data on approximately continuous scales thereby helping to maintain model resolution arora 2012 balasubramaniam and voulvoulis 2005 an important quality when dealing with such large numbers of catchments normalised indicator data for supply sub criteria were then multiplied by their respective weights depending on whether data was for groundwater bodies or river waterbodies and then summed the same process was then carried out for demand sub criteria fig 1 the resulting totals for supply and demand criteria were then multiplied by their respective weights and then the two were summed optionally the new totals can be multiplied by weights for hydrological setting the resulting values indicated the overall potential for pes to improve water quality fig 1 results were are divided into quintiles of supply demand and potential scores for river and groundwaters separately the first second third fourth and fifth quintiles indicate low medium low medium medium high and high supply demand or potential respectively while some catchments will have both high supply potential and high demand for improved water quality and lend themselves to a classic pes scheme other catchments may lack supply demand or both identifying these catchments would allow suggestions about alternative types of scheme for private sector investment in catchment management this was based on supply and demand scores for individual catchments and whether they were above or below the overall median and this was carried out for rivers and groundwaters separately these pes and alternative scheme types are defined in fig 2 2 4 validation in the absence of water quality data the approach was validated by testing the scientific hypothesis that catchments where pes are currently established or being established would contain a higher proportion of waterbodies scoring high potential or identified for pes restoration type schemes than would be present in the overall population of waterbodies this was tested on the premise that pes schemes are most likely to emerge where agriculture has the potential to increase the supply of water quality and there is a clear demand for improved water quality smith et al 2013 thirteen existing schemes containing 105 individual waterbodies were used in this validation fig 3 schemes included those in the rivers fowey western rother wicksters brook tamar wolf lyd sussex ouse evenlode middle severn and gara and in groundwaters frome and piddle upper hampshire avon and chichester chalk the proportions of waterbodies in these catchments scoring high potential were tested against the same proportion in the wider population using a two sample z test of proportions and this was repeated for waterbodies classified as suitable for pes restoration type schemes 2 5 technical legal and financial constraints in linking supply and demand three case study schemes in the south of england were examined in greater detail to show how the constraints in linking supply and demand are being identified and overcome all three schemes are case studies in the eu interreg va funded channel payments for ecosystem services project led by the university of chichester the project aims to establish pes schemes to improve water quality in the north of france and south of england for more information see https www cpes interreg eu en the three case studies used here were the river western rother in west sussex south downs groundwater in west sussex and the salcombe kingsbridge estuary in devon fig 3 they differ in hydrological setting as the river western rother and south downs groundwater both have ground and surface water hydrological components whereas being located away from principal aquifers the salcombe kingsbridge estuary is surface water dominated fig 3 the catchments also differ in supply and demand factors and in the technical legal and economic constraints in linking them and hence also have different scheme designs table 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 potential of pes for improving water quality the approach presented here is based on mca and uses expert judgement or current guidance to select criteria expert judgement to weight criteria and readily available national datasets to indicate those criteria once indicators are normalized it combines them in a weighted sums analysis and presents results spatially at the national scale all within a gis the analysis is flexible and can easily be built upon to include additional supply criteria such as pesticides bacteria metals or dissolved organic carbon and or additional demand criteria such as conservation and angling groups it can therefore also be easily applied to the country or region of interest by using locally relevant criteria expert judgement to weight those criteria and data to indicate them for example when applied to the situation for river waterbodies in england current guidance suggested that the potential for agriculture to improve the supply of good water quality for nitrogen phosphorus and sediments and the demand for improved water quality from key downstream users water companies and tourist and local recreational users should be key criteria for deciding potential readily available data were used to indicate these and expert judgement using pairwise comparisons assigned equal weight to supply and demand criteria and the highest weights to sediments and water companies for sub criteria respectively when combined in a weighted sums analysis it was possible to identify areas with high potential for pes and these results are presented in figs 4 and 5 for rivers high potential areas include the north and west of the country where the varied topography suits surface water collection and storage for drinking purposes whereas for groundwaters these areas were in the south east of the country where principal bedrock aquifers are present and there is a greater water company reliance on them as drinking water sources ea 2012 however as with mca in general the results are highly influenced by the selection of criteria and sub criteria balasubramaniam and voulvoulis 2005 and it is possible that results would follow a different spatial pattern when other pollutants or types of downstream users are included an alternative way of selecting comprehensive criteria and sub criteria would be to draw on expert judgement and this has been used with great success in other mca analyses e g bampa et al 2019 the main difference between this approach and the ones presented in similar studies is the focus here on private sector investment in catchment management through small scale pes schemes because of this focus it has been essential to weight criteria especially for demand as different downstream users vary greatly in their willingness to pay upstream farmers and in their abilities to set up a scheme this is compared to previous approaches that are mainly concerned with identifying areas for government investment in catchment management through national scale schemes where weighting may not have been so important e g locatelli et al 2014 wendland et al 2010 when applied to the situation in the england the approach was able to utilise high quality data compared to previous studies in data sparse areas e g burkhard et al 2012 vrebos et al 2015 this is due the catchment science specific high resolution data recently available in this country for instance supply indicators involved detailed modelling of pollutant loads to rivers and groundwaters for all waterbody catchments zhang et al 2014 indicating demand involved combining abstraction volumes with areas upstream of abstraction points which allowed water use downstream of the waterbody catchments to also be included as with many supply and demand mapping studies some aspects were constrained by data availability wolff et al 2015 and this would likely be the case when the approach is applied to more data sparse areas or countries pohle et al 2021 vrebos et al 2015 for example this study indicates demand from tourists for recreation using the percentage of tourist visits for outdoor recreation purposes this does not directly indicate use of the waterbodies for recreation because outdoor recreation does not always involve water while the willingness to pay of local and tourist recreational users for improved water quality has been accurately estimated for individual waterbodies glenk et al 2011 hampson et al 2017 an exercise to extrapolate those results to the national scale would very valuable for improving the mapping results in the future if the approach is to be considered at all accurate then catchments where pes are currently established or being established would contain a higher proportion of waterbodies scoring high potential than would be present in the overall population of waterbodies this was indeed the case with 65 of waterbodies within the catchments where pes are currently being established scoring high potential compared to 20 in the overall population significantly different to p 0 0001 these proportions were not expected to reach 100 since not all factors were included in the analysis and because pes is often targeted at problematic waterbodies within the wider catchment area of the scheme and these were not always known this validation would be further strengthened by water quality improvement data from the schemes when it becomes available this validation exercise also shows how pes schemes are already starting to emerge in a small proportion of high potential waterbodies and this mapping study could further motivate that proliferation even though the target pollutants and scale of these schemes will not always be aligned with the wfd a water quality improvement at any level should be a welcome contribution to achieving ges the current agricultural policy reforms happening in europe must ensure adaptation of policy to accommodate this new wave of catchment management 3 2 type of schemes to improve water quality the approach was also validated based on the scientific hypothesis that catchments where pes are currently established or being established would contain a higher proportion of waterbodies identified as suitable for pes restoration type schemes than would be present in the overall population of waterbodies indeed 76 of waterbodies within catchments where pes schemes are being or have been established were identified as being suitable for pes restoration type schemes compared to 25 in the overall population significantly different to p 0 0001 the situation where water companies are incentivising upstream farmers to adopt better practices because they are being impacted by diffuse pollution or pes restoration type schemes are the most common types of scheme found in england however there are alternative options for private sector investment in catchment management for when supply potential demand or both are lacking to suggest alternative types the mapping approach further classifies catchments as being best suited to either pes protection community restoration or community protection type schemes this is based on whether their scores for supply and demand are above or below the overall median and this was carried out for rivers and groundwaters separately figs 4 5 the pes protection type schemes would be best suited to catchments with high water company demand but low potential for agriculture to improve the supply of good water quality such areas include the thames basin upstream of london where sources other than agriculture are more important for water quality figs 4 5 however these schemes may still be important as they can provide protection when external forces such as the agricultural intensification bought about by the abolition of eu milk quotas groeneveld et al 2016 or climate change ockenden et al 2017 threaten to increase agricultural diffuse pollution as such water companies would establish these schemes for risk management since they aim to eliminate future impacts and associated costs of water treatment catchments with high supply but low demand scores where community restoration schemes are more suited are mainly located around the fringes of the country figs 4 5 these schemes would likely require an intermediary organisation to effectively facilitate payments from multiple individuals and businesses to farmers cook et al 2017 engel et al 2008 these intermediaries may play a number of roles including introducing downstream users and farmers and building rapport between them establishing water quality baselines identifying best practices that will improve water quality assisting in determining prices accessing grants structuring agreements and agreeing a mutually acceptable payment regime performing activities related to implementation including monitoring certification verification etc and overall scheme administration cook et al 2017 smith et al 2013 these activities cannot be conducted without cost and one example of how policy might be adapted to accommodate pes is to channel more government funding towards the facilitation of these community type schemes either by regulatory bodies or environmental charities if the budget available for incentivising practice and or land use change is not sufficient to improve water quality intermediaries may also seek additional private sector funds from outside the catchment for example from companies looking to offset their carbon emissions in catchments with low supply and demand externally funded protective schemes may look similar except with the aim to ensure the inputs of pollutants from agriculture kept low 3 3 technical legal and financial constraints in linking supply and demand this mapping approach allowed for some basic supply and demand barriers to be identified in advance see supplementary table s2 and these barriers were confirmed by more detailed research within each catchment table 2 however it could not be expected to identify the catchment specific constraints in linking supply and demand instead the downstream users or intermediary organisations establishing a scheme would carry out thorough research to understand their catchments and design the scheme in detail in the case study schemes this research involved gathering existing data monitoring modelling field experiments cost benefit analysis stakeholder analysis and mapping and stakeholder engagement amongst others these constraints included technical challenges such as targeting of payments at critical source areas of the catchment that contribute the majority of pollutant loads legal constraints such as those that discourage or prevent tenant farmers from enroling on schemes and economic constraints such as the balance between the costs that impacts are creating the actual budget available for catchment management and the estimated costs of improving water quality through catchment management table 2 in the south downs groundwater scheme combined monitoring and modelling by the water company identified a gradual increasing trend in nitrate concentrations at their groundwater boreholes as water moves slowly through the chalk matrix 1 m yr 1 this trend is overlain by a series of spikes which they proved through tracer experiments to be due to rapid transfer of n through fissures in the chalk in response to rainfall events stuart et al 2016 the water company identified all fields overlying these fissures and plan to target payments for arable reversion to low input grassland on them to address the n spikes they will also incentivise widespread adoption of cover crops in attempt to halt any increase in the longer term trend farmers on short term tenancy agreements or farmers whose landlord determines any interaction with agri environment schemes may be less likely to enrol on these types of schemes harrison mayfield et al 1998 maye et al 2009 this has been the case particularly in the western rother catchment where despite over 50 years of research into erosion and management the issue remains unresolved boardman 2016 boardman et al 2009 farres et al 1990 to encourage adoption of practices the water company operating in this catchment are working with farmers to co design a scheme to ensure practices are financially attractive and compatible with the farming systems present they are also working with land owners to have certain practices written into farm tenancy agreements understanding the costs that water quality impacts are creating relative to the costs of incentivising enough practices to improve water quality can be key to designing a successful pes scheme for instance in the south downs groundwater scheme it was important for the water company s catchment management team to demonstrate this to be able to secure internal funding for pes through their modelling work they demonstrated that incentivising farmers in a pes scheme would cost 3 3 m to achieve the desired affect by 2075 this is compared to the 8 m cost of setting up and running a nitrate removal plant over the same timescale giving a net benefit of 4 7 m a clear case for pes restoration such a quantitative assessment is not always necessary in the salcombe kingsbridge estuary scheme it was quite clear to the westcountry rivers trust wrt the intermediary organisation establishing a community restoration type scheme that funds generated within the catchment would not be sufficient to improve water quality the multiple individual or small business buyers that are present here are generally supportive of the concept of catchment management however previous schemes have found them difficult to engage rogers et al 2015 the wrt have established a trust fund to which local businesses and individuals can contribute which will reduce the costs associated with multiple transactions jack et al 2008 goldman benner et al 2012 to further boost funds they are also looking to attract external buyers who wish to offset their carbon emissions by investing in practices like tree planting that result in carbon sequestration they will distribute the funds to farmers in exchange for practice or land use change either through one to one visits with a wrt advisor to negotiate grant funding or through a reverse auction system in the auction system farmers bid for funds and the bids likely to deliver the greatest impacts on water quality are funded making any actions more cost effective valcu lisman et al 2017 the wrt are also involved in several of the other schemes mentioned in section 2 4 such as those in the river tamar catchment these are just a few of the design considerations made in the case study schemes in order to link supply and demand and realise pes potential they also made many of the frequently cited design considerations such as how the scheme will provide additional protection or restoration for water quality above what is already present and how the payments will be conditional on implementation of practices engel et al 2008 wunder et al 2018 the channel payments for ecosystem services project will bring together experiences from these schemes and from three other schemes in northern france to provide up to date guidance specific to catchment management for designing pes in this second tier 4 conclusion this study presents an approach to mapping the potential for pes to improve water quality in agricultural catchments the approach is based on mca with the potential for agriculture to increase the supply of good water quality and the demand from downstream water users for water quality improvements included as key criteria the approach involves the following steps 1 select supply and demand sub criteria using expert judgement or current guidance on pes 2 weight criteria using expert judgement through pairwise comparisons 3 indicate criteria with readily available national datasets 4 normalise indicators using appropriate techniques 5 combine indicators in a weighted sums analysis 6 present results at the national scale this approach can easily be applied to the country or region of interest by using locally relevant criteria expert judgement and data when applied to the situation in england it was possible to identify areas of high potential which would hopefully motivate more detailed research at the individual catchment level into the constraints in linking supply and demand this approach also allows for some basic barriers to pes to be identified and suggestions for alternative types of schemes to be made furthermore by simultaneously assessing the current state of pes in england it was possible to make some initial policy recommendations specifically this was that policy must be adapted to accommodate this new wave of catchment management one way that this might happen is for some government funding

16542,class 1 and other integrons are common in wastewater networks often being associated with antibiotic resistance genes args however the importance of different integron structures in arg transfer within wastewater systems has only been implied especially between community and hospital sources among wastewater treatment plant compartments and in receiving waters this uncertainty is partly because current clinical class 1 integron qpcr assays i e that target human impacted structures i e clinti1 poorly delineate clinti1 from non impacted class 1 integron structures they also say nothing about their arg content to fill these technical gaps new real time qpcr assays were developed for impacted class 1 structures called aint1 i e anthropogenic class 1 integrons and empty aint1 structures i e carry no args called eaint1 the new assays and other integron assays then were used to examine integron dynamics across a wastewater network 16s metagenomic sequencing also was performed to characterise associated microbiomes aint1 abundances per bacterial cell were about 10 times greater in hospital wastewaters compared with other compartments suggesting aint1 enrichment with args in hospital sources conversely the relative abundance of eaint1 structures were over double in recycled activated sludge compared with other compartments except receiving waters ras 30 of ras class 1 structures did not carry args microbiome analysis showed that human associated bacterial taxa with mobile integrons also differed in ras and river sediments further class 1 integrons in ras bacteria appear to have released args whereas hospital bacteria have accumulated args results show that quantifying integron dynamics can help explain where arg transfer occurs in wastewater networks and should be considered in future studies on antibiotic resistance in the environment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords integron dynamics wastewater networks class 1 integrons empty integron structures antibiotic resistance genes qpcr probes 1 introduction increasing antibiotic resistance is an evolutionary response to the overuse of antibiotics and environmental pollution and is a global health concern chen and zhang 2013 devarajan et al 2016 quintela baluja et al 2015 xu et al 2016 antibiotic use selects for resistance strains in human and animal wastes which can be released to the environment via wastewater spreading antibiotic resistance genes args and bacteria across nature selection is often through versatile gene transfer mechanisms which allow relatively unconstrained arg migration across phylogenetic ecological and geographic borders as such the use of antibiotics in one habitat e g hospitals can impact resistomes in other locations across the environment therefore understanding the vectors and transfer mechanisms by which bacteria share and acquire args is important maybe more important than studying the levels of args themselves a key group of arg transmission vectors in bacteria are integrons that are carried on mobile genetic elements mges including plasmids and transposons cambray et al 2010 integrons are genetically mobile bacterial recombination systems i e mobile integrons that allow the acquisition and expression of promoterless protein coding sequences gene cassettes gc they can confer rapid adaptation and selective advantage to host bacteria often under specific environmental pressures a large array of gcs that carry args have been found in integrons associated with mges cambray et al 2010 partridge et al 2009 which are very diverse and associated with arg transmission cambray et al 2011 three classes of mobile integrons i e class 1 2 and 3 appear to be most important for acquiring and transmitting args cambray et al 2010 class 1 integrons inti1 are the most prevalent class among clinical and environmental isolates cambray et al 2010 cambray et al 2011 deng et al 2015 partridge et al 2009 however all three integron classes inti1 inti2 and inti3 are found in human animal and environmental metagenomes cambray et al 2010 deng et al 2015 simo tchuinte et al 2016 stokes and gillings 2011 these integrons are often associated with proteobacteria species although inti1 has also been found in gram positive strains cambray et al 2010 deng et al 2015 partridge et al 2009 over 130 gcs with args have been found on mobile integrons stalder et al 2012 class 1 integrons that carry args are found in both pathogenic and non pathogenic strains although not all class 1 integrons are the same a sub group of class 1 integrons have been related with clinical settings hereafter called clinical class 1 integrons clinti1 gillings et al 2008 clinti1 differs from other class 1 integrons in that its integron integrase gene is conserved 5 cs end but it carries an additional segment at its 3 cs end which is composed of qaceδ1 low level resistance to quaternary ammonium compounds sul1 sulfonamide resistance and orf5 unknown function gillings et al 2008 like other class 1 integrons clinti1 is co regulated by sos response systems suggesting reordering and acquiring existing exogenous cassettes may be activated under stressed conditions when genetic adaptation is needed barraud and ploy 2015 cambray et al 2011 however integron regulation is not fully understood in particular how it influences the dynamics of arg transmission and antibiotic resistance spread understanding the role of integrons within a system is further confused by the fact that many integrons including clinti1 can be found empty e g carrying no args chakraborty et al 2013 chang et al 2007 dillon et al 2005 moura et al 2012 sá et al 2010 toval et al 2015 the incorporation of args into clinti1 also occurs in the absence of antibiotics pérez valdespino et al 2016 suggesting integron and arg ecology are not solely driven by antibiotic use here we examine integron dynamics by quantifying different integrons and microbiota across a wastewater network that includes community and hospital sources sewer lines a wastewater treatment plant wwtp and upstream and downstream receiving waters fig 1 integron types states and possible bacterial hosts called here potential bacteria carrying mobile integrons or pbcmi were compared across compartments the goal was to delineate the spatial dynamics of integrons especially human impacted class 1 integrons to help explain where arg transmission really occurs within wastewater systems however to do this we needed to design new probe primer sets that better segregate clinti1 from inti1 and probes for quantifying class 1 structures that do not carry args 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sampling procedure sampling was performed during the summer in a city in northern spain which has limited heavy industry or agriculture a schematic of the network is shown in fig 1 samples were collected over three weeks including effluents from two hospitals hp a and hp b the parallel community sewer line cm the wwtp influent inf and effluent eff recycled activated sludge ras and the river water column and sediments 100 m upstream ru and sru and downstream rd and srd of the wwtp discharge further details of the wastewater network sampling regime and sample handling and processing methods have been reported previously quintela baluja et al

harvested for dna extraction via vacuum filtration using sterile 0 22 μm membrane disc filters millipore billerica ma usa or by centrifugation at 12 000 rpm for 30 min extraction was performed using the fast dna spin kit for soils mp biomedicals usa according to the manufacturer s instructions dna was stored at 20 c prior to subsequent analysis 2 3 design of new primers and probes to quantify alternate clinical class 1 integron structures the terminology of gillings et al 2008 has been used for many years to define class 1 integron recombination platforms pre clinical class 1 integrons are elements that contain a class 1 integrase which includes a complete tni transposition module pclinti1 conversely clinical class 1 integrons clinti1 contain qaceδ sul1 and orf5 in their structure a random subset of recently published plasmid sequences was examined and it was determined the old primer set for clinti1 poorly discriminated from pclinti1 structures figure s1 tables s1 s3 therefore we designed a new set of primers that are more specific to the qaceδ sul1 and orf5 structure which we call the aint1 assay our new name represents anthropogenically impacted class 1 integrons and is an appropriate name for class 1 integrons that have been impacted by human activity and not just clinical factors in parallel we also designed a new assay for anthropogenic class 1 integrons that do not carry args which we call empty structures eaint1 the design process of the new assays is provided under results 2 4 quantitative pcr assays and related data analysis inti1 inti2 and inti3 as well as aint1 and eaint1 were quantified using the qpcr taqman method table 1 taqman qpcr reactions were conducted using ssoadvanced universal probes supermix biorad employing the following thermocycler program 3 min of initial denaturation at 95 c and 40 cycles of 5 sec denaturation at 95 c and 30 sec annealing extension see temperatures in table 1 in addition total bacteria and total coliforms were quantified using a sybr green based qpcr assay sybr green reactions were conducted using ssoadvanced universal sybr green supermix biorad employing the following thermocycler program 2 min of initial denaturation at 98 c and 40 cycles of 5 sec denaturation at 98 c and 5 sec annealing extension at 60 c total bacteria or 55 c total coliforms the limit of detection lod and limit of quantification loq were calculated using a 2 fold dilution series covering the range of 1 to 500 gene copies gc from each standard and analysed eight times r script available at https github com cmerkes qpcr lod calc the lod was defined as the lowest concentration that can be reliably detected i e at which at least 95 of standard reactions are expected to amplify the loq was defined as the lowest standard that can be quantified with a coefficient of variation less than 0 35 klymus et al 2020 table s4 all assays were carried out in triplicate using the biorad cfx c1000 system biorad hercules ca usa to minimise inhibition extracted dna was diluted to a working concentration of 5 ng ul and a dna internal positive control was used in sybr green reactions briefly an additional reaction was performed for each sample containing 104 genes copies of the green fluorescent protein gene gfp inhibition was considered to be minimal when the difference in ct values δct of gfp between the spiked sample and the positive control was below 1 ct standard curves for each primer set were constructed using plasmid clones of the target sequences these were loaded in triplicate in each qpcr run in parallel with the amplification of test samples all samples were run in triplicate using the optimum qpcr conditions determined for each primer set related statistical analyses and data manipulation were performed using the r environment team 2006 with a significant cutoff of α 0 05 normality and the variance homoscedasticity were tested by the shapiro wilk test and levene s test respectively previous conditions were not met for all integron datasets therefore the krustall wallis test was performed to assess statistically significant differences conover s test was performed for pairwise comparison between sampling sites and adjusted p values were calculated with the holm bonferroni method 2 5 16s rrna gene amplification sequencing and data processing to assess microbial communities pcr amplification of the v4 v5 region of bacterial 16s rrna genes in dna extracts was conducted using fusion primers containing a pgm sequencing adaptor a gt spacer and a unique 12 base pair golay barcode

2019 sequencing was performed using an ion torrent personal genome system life technology with processing performed using a uparse qiime pipeline pylro et al 2014 pylro et al 2016 the operational taxonomic unit otu table was built using the uparse pipeline edgar 2004 sequences were clustered into otus at a 97 similarity cut off checked for chimaeras and reflective sequences were obtained for each phylotype taxonomic classification used qiime caporaso et al 2010 based on the uclust method prasad et al 2015 see quintela baluja et al 2019 for details all data analysis and visualisations were conducted using r team 2006 through the rstudio ide http www rstudio com otu counts and associated taxonomic assignments were imported and merged into a phyloseq object mcmurdie and holmes 2013 all

completeness sample coverage and alpha diversity were calculated with the r package inext hsieh et al 2016 alpha diversity was calculated using hill numbers d with q from 0 to 3 and were expressed in units of effective number of species as q increases low abundance otus are assigned less weight while high abundance otus are assigned more weight this enables the investigation of diversity at different scales at q 0 d is simply the number of observed otus richness at q 1 dexp shannon and at q 2 d is equal to inverse simpson s index a cluster dendrogram of community composition dissimilarity bray curtis average neighbour clustering was calculated with the r package vegan oksanen et al 2019 to determine the potential bacteria carrying mobile integrons pbcmis in each compartment consensus sequences from class 1 anthropogenic and non anthropogenic 2 and 3 integrons were aligned against the ncbinr database database accessed on june 2019 using blast mcginnis and madden 2004 accession numbers from sequences with 100 identity were downloaded and taxonomy assigned with the r package taxonomizr only families with more than one entry in the ncbinr database were considered as potential integron hosts and used to filter the otu table from the samples the pbcmis otu level distribution across the network was visualized using a two dimensional hierarchical clustering in conjunction with a heatmap of relative abundances 2 6 biomarker signature analysis linear discriminant analysis effect sizes lefse was employed to identify pbcmi that are statistically significant across sampling locations segata et al 2011 with the normalised relative abundance matrix lefse uses the kruskal wallis rank sum test to detect features with significantly different abundances between the assigned taxa and performs linear discriminant analysis to estimate the effect size of each feature only taxa with average abundances 1 were considered significant a significance level alpha of 0 05 and an effect size threshold of 2x were used for all the biomarkers evaluated in this study 2 7 co occurrence between integrons and microbial taxa a correlation matrix was developed by calculating all possible pairwise spearman s rank correlations among 267 bacterial families the three integrases inti1 inti2 and inti3 and the 3 cs conserved region of aint1 present in samples from the study n 27 a correlation between two items was considered if the spearman s correlation coefficient ρ was 0 5 and the p value was 0 05 to reduce the chances of obtaining false positive results the p values were adjusted with a multiple testing correction using the benjamini hochberg method benjamini and hochberg 1995 the pairwise correlations of the bacterial families and integrases formed their co occurrence networks network analyses were performed in r environment and was further visualised and explored to identify its topological properties i e clustering

primers for class 1 integrons and associated gene cassettes already exist gillings et al 2009 gillings et al 2009 holmes et al 2003 stokes et al 2001 one set has dominated use i e clinti1 hereafter called the old set gillings et al 2015 this old set targets the integron integrase gene 5 cs end however when one compares that target sequence with more recent sequencing data it becomes clear the region does not clearly discriminate between clinical and pre clinical class 1 integrons figure s1 pre clinical here meaning the evolutionary precursor of clinti1 however we identified a conserved 3 cs region i e attc qacδe1 sul1 that is unique to clinical i e human impacted or anthropogenic class 1 integrons see figs 2 and s2 and tables s1 s3 for details using this region we designed and validated a new set of probe primers that better segregate human impacted class 1 from non impacted class 1 structures table 1 the assay design was as follows sequences of each individual region were first aligned using muscle in ugene v 33 to identify optimal target regions for more specific primers figure s2 this revealed selective targets within amplicon containing sequences at intersecting loci between attc qacδe1 and atti attc fig 2 using this region primers and taqman probes were designed using oligoarchitect http www oligoarchitect com with a melting temperature tm of 60 c the selected primers and probes were aligned against ncbi using blast mcginnis and madden 2004 to rule out non specific binding to other bacterial targets we call our new probe primer assay aint1 to avoid confusion with the old set the new probe primer set was assessed in terms of historic clinical and non clinical integron structures tables s2 and s3 and shows aint1 better targets the conserved 3 cs segment of the clinical structure attc qacδe1 sul1 and does not overlap with pre clinical structures henceforth we only refer to aint1 hereafter using a similar approach a new probe primer assay was also designed to quantify empty anthropogenic class i integron structures which we call eaint1 table 1 the need to segregate between empty structures and integrons carrying gcs was evident as all of the empty class i integron structures in our plasmid sequence dataset were associated with anthropogenic class 1 structures the old assay did not uniquely detect anthropogenic class 1 integron structures nor indicate whether they were carrying args in the gc combining aint1 and eaint1 allows one to quantify anthropogenic class 1 integron dynamics more exactly segregating gcs that do not contain args 3 2 integron pool and distribution across our urban wastewater network quantification of integron structures across our wastewater network showed that class 1 integrons were present in all compartments table 2 and s5 fig 3 in contrast class 2 integron levels were low everywhere and below detection in river samples collected upstream of the wastewater effluent discharge point or in the downstream water column class 3 integrons were also low in upstream samples and lower across the wastewater network except in hospital wastewater samples following quantification of integron gene levels per bacterial cell across the network i e as genome equivalent hospital effluents contained significantly higher levels of integron genes per cell p 0 05 much greater than any other compartment fig 3 table 2 metadata on chemical conditions in each compartment is shown in table s6 within the wwtp itself integron abundances decreased between 93 to 98 from influent to effluent log removals of 1 18 0 28 mean sd for inti1 log 1 66 0 26 for inti2 and log 1 21 0 16 for inti3 these removals directly paralleled bacterial removals table 2 and s5 implying the removal of bacterial hosts and mges occur in tandem across the treatment steps this is confirmed by inti1 aint1 and inti3 copies per bacterial cell being roughly constant across the system table s7 despite large reductions in integrons across the wwtp absolute class 1 and 3 integron gene abundances increased in the river downstream of the wwtp suggesting integrons were still reaching the environment the new probe primer design showed that the ratio of aint1 to inti1 did vary across raw wastewater compartments fig 4 a aint1 was the dominant integron structure downstream of the biological wastewater treatment unit p 0 05 fig 4b with relatively low levels of eaint1 in contrast the percentage of eaint1 in ras was consistently higher double that in wwtp influents and hospital samples and much higher than any other compartment fig 4c d except downstream river locations 3 3 identifying potential bacteria carrying mobile integrons pbcmi integrase gene abundance across this wastewater network correlates with the type and abundance of bacterial populations which was previously observed for args within this network quintela baluja et al 2019 therefore data here lends itself well to statistical analysis on most probable populations carrying key integrons especially inti1 vs aint1 vs eaint1 screening of the ncbinr database found 28 potential bacterial families known to host inti1 14 for aint1 6 for inti2 and 4 for inti3 table s8 only inti1 has been previously found in gram positive bacteria whereas the 3 cs conserved region of aint1 has only been found in gram negative bacteria of the identified families with mobile integrons from the database 21 were found in one or more samples in this study table s8 beta diversity analysis was used to compare microbial community diversities among wastewater network locations for this analysis the dataset was re sampled to ensure the same number of reads per sample 8 577 which corresponded to the sample with the fewest number of sequences resulting in 5 698 otus the otus from pbcmi families were filtered and re sampled from the raw reads to the sample with the fewest number of sequences 1 266 resulting in 392 unique otus the percentage of total estimated species richness in each sample resulted in 95 4 99 0 for the total microbial community and 94 4 98 1 for the pbcmi which suggests the overall microbial communities were adequately sampled in both cases table s9 hill number diversity indices were calculated with the parameter q from 0 to 2 note that as q increases rare species are given less weight and contribute less toward the effective number of otus in a sample hill numbers with q equal to 0 and 1 showed that raw wastewater samples had lower diversity compared with upstream river samples both water column and sediment and from the downstream river sediments fig s3 specifically hill numbers q equal to 0 and 1 indicated that bacterial diversity was greater in samples upstream of the wwtp ru sru because of more rare taxa which was not apparent when only pbcmi taxa were considered fig s4 conversely the bray curtis dissimilarity dendrogram showed that total microbial community compositions differed among network compartments which included four main clusters with distinct ecosystems cut off 0 72 fig s5 the first cluster contained samples associated with raw wastewater community hospital and wwtp influent the second cluster contained ras wwtp effluent and the downstream river water and sediment samples the third and fourth clusters included the river water column and sediment samples upstream of the wwtp respectively the pbcmi sub community followed similar patterns but the cut off value of the cluster structure was significantly lower cut off 0 53 this observation in conjunction with evident two dimensional hierarchical clustering seen in the heatmap of pbcmi relative abundances fig s6 suggests that a pbcmi core sub community exists in all network compartments however fig s6 shows that wwtp releases clearly impact river microbial communities increasing pbcmis in the downstream environment figs 5 and s6 the family comamonadaceae is ubiquitous which is often associated with wastewater e g aeromonadaceae and enterobacteriaceae and those more associated with the environment e g rodobacteriaceae or sphingomonadaceae 3 4 microbial communities and their connectivity across the network characterising microbial communities across a wastewater network in terms of diversity evenness and taxonomic composition is key to identifying linkages among compartments and determining microbial contributions from internal versus external sources lefse analysis showed the relative presence of the family erysipelotrichaceae lachnospiraceae bacteroidaceae and ruminococcaceae tend to best define community wastewater in contrast hospital wastewater was characterised by higher abundances of prevotellaceae enterobacteriaceae and desulfovibrionaceae weeksellaceae and moraxellaceae were associated with wwtp influent whereas ras was best defined by rhodobacteraceae frankiaceae dietziaceae gordoniaceae and intrasporangiaceae fig s7 each compartment of the network had characteristic reflective signature families suggesting local enrichment and or selection to examine this we combined the biomarker discovery tool lefse and co occurrence network analysis to assess the relative transmission of args associated with mobile integrons across compartments the co correlation network consists of 259 nodes 255 taxa and 4 mobile integrons and 4 465 edges with an average degree or node connectivity of 34 479 the average network distance between all pairs of nodes average path length was 2 94 edges with a network diameter of 7 edges bacterial families comprising pbcmi that most explain differences between network compartments lefse analysis are highlighted in fig s7 network analysis produced four different modules fig s8 equivalent to the microbial composition dissimilarity clusters the network showed possible arg dissemination pathways via mobile integrons from human associated taxa module i to bacteria in human impacted environments module ii and non human environmental bacteria modules iii and iv lefse analysis revealed that module i include bacterial families defining raw wastewater cm hp and inf and all mobile integrons fig s9a conversely module ii mostly contains ras and river sediment taxa with limited pbcmi contributions ras rd srd and eff emphasising the connectivity of ras bacteria with river sediments fig s8b module iii contains taxa defining the river water column fig s8c finally module iv contains mostly bacterial families in upstream river sediments sru however some bacteria families from the downstream river sediments also are present in module iv fig s8d 4 discussion here we show that inti1 and aint1 dominated all compartments in our wastewater network with inti2 and inti3 being much less abundant at all sampling points all integron markers except for empty structures eaint1 were highest in hospital wastewater where antibiotic use is more intensive escudero oñate et al 2017 rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 this is consistent with previous data that showed the relative number of args per bacterial cell were at least one order of magnitude higher in hospital wastewater compared with the other compartments quintela baluja et al 2019 interestingly while inti2 levels per bacterial cell declined along the wastewater process stream the relative levels of inti1 aint1 and inti3 per cell did not change amongst compartments except in upstream river samples consistently low levels of inti2 are probably due to it typically lacking a functional integrase meaning it cannot catalyse recombination reactions alone deng et al 2015 it is noteworthy that inti3 was detected across the whole wastewater network and roughly mirrored inti1 patterns although abundances were about 20 times lower than inti1 the ubiquitous presence of inti3 here contrasts with results of stalder et al 2014 who found inti3 levels decreased across their wwtp this may be due to differences in inti3 found in the two studies or differences between the local wastewater systems inti3 performs a similar function to inti1 although its recombination frequencies have historically been lower stokes and gillings 2011 which makes inti3 less associated with bacterial adaptation under adverse conditions empty human impacted class 1 integron structures have been found previously malek et al 2015 mokracka et al 2012 moura et al 2012 sá et al 2010 toval et al 2015 but here we more exactly quantified levels of eaint1 vs aint1 and inti1 we had expected to find higher relative abundances of eaint1 cassettes in hospital wastewater it was hypothesized that the presence of higher concentrations of antibiotics and other bioactive agents would select for cellular defence gcs and trigger sos responses that would activate integrase aint1 expression cambray 2011 but instead the highest relative abundances of eaint1 cassettes were found in ras samples suggesting this is where empty cassettes accumulate or more likely arg carriage is not a selection factor for bacterial hosts that reside in ras ras appears to have a reduced tendency for class 1 integrons or their hosts to retain args although the scale of differences may be specific to our network we suggest hospital wastewaters tend to select and retain a greater array of defence genes in their aint1 due to greater stressors in their environment e g therapeutic drugs and or richer organic carbon levels wastes dominated by faeces from patients similar uniqueness of hospital wastewater was also seen in sweden kraupner et al 2021 conversely bacteria in ras grow under nutrient limited conditions and under longer residence times e g than a gut environment thus ras bacteria are under persistent nutrient stress compared to the gut most activated sludge wwtps recycle ras for days rather than hours under comparatively dilute but fluctuating biotic and abiotic conditions such conditions might promote rearrangement in aint1 and loss of args but apparently not reacquisition possibly because selective agents e g antibiotics are more dilute or not bioavailable the high prevalence of empty cassettes in ras and their apparent low presence in the wwtp effluents has important implications to pathways of integron mediated arg spread from wwtps to the environment until now only two studies have used high throughput sequencing to study inti1 cassette diversity in environmental samples gatica et al 2016 stalder et al 2014 while stalder et al 2014 sequenced clone libraries of inti1 cassettes from wastewater compartments gatica et al 2016 targeted recombination sites that flank the gene cassettes of inti1 genes in wwtp effluents both studies found a high diversity of gene cassettes however many of their detected sequences had unknown functions stalder et al 2014 found their wwtp tended to reduce the diversity of gene cassette arrays relative to raw wastewater and had elevated levels of empty cassettes whereas gatica et al 2016 showed a marginal persistence of β lactam resistance gene cassettes in soil microbiomes impacted by wwtp effluents work here shows the nature and content of integron structures and associated microbial communities differ widely across compartments further confirming local evolutionary ecosystems drive selection in sub ecosystems embedded within larger networks baquero et al 2008 quintela baluja et al 2019 local ecosystems and their communities are spatially separate and each is driven by different habitat and other selective factors this includes specific community selection munck et al 2015 and arg carriage quintela baluja et al 2019 parallel differences exist among prevalent mobile integrons and their state relative to arg carriage empty or not however even though different wastewater compartments have different communities continual hydraulic interconnection allows microbial dispersal and gene flow which explains linkages among local resistomes including local mobile integrons co occurrence analysis fig s s8 and s9 highlights the association of pbcmis within microbial communities in raw wastewater especially compared with communities less impacted by raw wastewater the importance of this observation is most evident in river sediments where resident bacteria and their mobile integrons reflect unsettled floc in wwtp effluents as such sediments may be place of environmental arg transfer although there would need to be selective drivers for gene acquisition to occur such as other pollutants in the sediments our previous work supported this hypothesis where downstream sediments were largely comprised of ras bacteria quintela baluja et al 2019 a recent study by di cesare et al 2020 supported this hypothesis by showing that the vertical distribution of inti1 in lake sediments mirrored the deposition of bacteria from the water column and to sediments below consistent with previous work sediments downstream of our wwtp were enriched in args probably due to outputs from the wwtp di cesare et al 2020 quintela baluja et al 2019 which is consistent with greater abundances of aint1 compared with upstream sediments although it is speculation we suspect the co release of potentially selective agents in wwtp effluents might further promote such persistence specifically the dynamic process of gene cassette acquisition in aint1 and the presence of a qac gene in its structure resistance to biocides potentially confers advantageous phenotypes that may be behind the fixation and spread of this integron structure gillings et al 2009 a noteworthy new observation here which supports the potential for arg transfer in sediments downstream of wwtps is elevated levels of eaint1 the two compartments with the highest relative levels of empty clinical class 1 integron cassettes are the ras and downstream sediments which implies they are hydraulically connected and may be locations of reacquisition of args due to higher levels of empty mobile integrons a comparison of microbial communities between ras and downstream sediments quintela baluja et al 2019 furthers shows this connection and suggests downstream sediments could be locations of elevated horizontal gene transfer 5 conclusions here we show that integrons have their own ecology within a wastewater network and can be used to speculate on the dynamics of args within such systems however integron dynamics appear more complex than previously reported especially the spatial distribution of args and relationships with human impacted and empty class 1 integron cassettes this recognition was only possible by developing a more exact probe primers for anthropogenic class 1 integrons that better segregate class 1 integron types and determine whether they carry args or not we are clearly getting closer to understanding what really happens in wastewater networks relative to amr spread but new evidence here suggests arg transmission in wastewater networks may differ than previously beleived regardless we hope this work will guide new and

16542,class 1 and other integrons are common in wastewater networks often being associated with antibiotic resistance genes args however the importance of different integron structures in arg transfer within wastewater systems has only been implied especially between community and hospital sources among wastewater treatment plant compartments and in receiving waters this uncertainty is partly because current clinical class 1 integron qpcr assays i e that target human impacted structures i e clinti1 poorly delineate clinti1 from non impacted class 1 integron structures they also say nothing about their arg content to fill these technical gaps new real time qpcr assays were developed for impacted class 1 structures called aint1 i e anthropogenic class 1 integrons and empty aint1 structures i e carry no args called eaint1 the new assays and other integron assays then were used to examine integron dynamics across a wastewater network 16s metagenomic sequencing also was performed to characterise associated microbiomes aint1 abundances per bacterial cell were about 10 times greater in hospital wastewaters compared with other compartments suggesting aint1 enrichment with args in hospital sources conversely the relative abundance of eaint1 structures were over double in recycled activated sludge compared with other compartments except receiving waters ras 30 of ras class 1 structures did not carry args microbiome analysis showed that human associated bacterial taxa with mobile integrons also differed in ras and river sediments further class 1 integrons in ras bacteria appear to have released args whereas hospital bacteria have accumulated args results show that quantifying integron dynamics can help explain where arg transfer occurs in wastewater networks and should be considered in future studies on antibiotic resistance in the environment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords integron dynamics wastewater networks class 1 integrons empty integron structures antibiotic resistance genes qpcr probes 1 introduction increasing antibiotic resistance is an evolutionary response to the overuse of antibiotics and environmental pollution and is a global health concern chen and zhang 2013 devarajan et al 2016 quintela baluja et al 2015 xu et al 2016 antibiotic use selects for resistance strains in human and animal wastes which can be released to the environment via wastewater spreading antibiotic resistance genes args and bacteria across nature selection is often through versatile gene transfer mechanisms which allow relatively unconstrained arg migration across phylogenetic ecological and geographic borders as such the use of antibiotics in one habitat e g hospitals can impact resistomes in other locations across the environment therefore understanding the vectors and transfer mechanisms by which bacteria share and acquire args is important maybe more important than studying the levels of args themselves a key group of arg transmission vectors in bacteria are integrons that are carried on mobile genetic elements mges including plasmids and transposons cambray et al 2010 integrons are genetically mobile bacterial recombination systems i e mobile integrons that allow the acquisition and expression of promoterless protein coding sequences gene cassettes gc they can confer rapid adaptation and selective advantage to host bacteria often under specific environmental pressures a large array of gcs that carry args have been found in integrons associated with mges cambray et al 2010 partridge et al 2009 which are very diverse and associated with arg transmission cambray et al 2011 three classes of mobile integrons i e class 1 2 and 3 appear to be most important for acquiring and transmitting args cambray et al 2010 class 1 integrons inti1 are the most prevalent class among clinical and environmental isolates cambray et al 2010 cambray et al 2011 deng et al 2015 partridge et al 2009 however all three integron classes inti1 inti2 and inti3 are found in human animal and environmental metagenomes cambray et al 2010 deng et al 2015 simo tchuinte et al 2016 stokes and gillings 2011 these integrons are often associated with proteobacteria species although inti1 has also been found in gram positive strains cambray et al 2010 deng et al 2015 partridge et al 2009 over 130 gcs with args have been found on mobile integrons stalder et al 2012 class 1 integrons that carry args are found in both pathogenic and non pathogenic strains although not all class 1 integrons are the same a sub group of class 1 integrons have been related with clinical settings hereafter called clinical class 1 integrons clinti1 gillings et al 2008 clinti1 differs from other class 1 integrons in that its integron integrase gene is conserved 5 cs end but it carries an additional segment at its 3 cs end which is composed of qaceδ1 low level resistance to quaternary ammonium compounds sul1 sulfonamide resistance and orf5 unknown function gillings et al 2008 like other class 1 integrons clinti1 is co regulated by sos response systems suggesting reordering and acquiring existing exogenous cassettes may be activated under stressed conditions when genetic adaptation is needed barraud and ploy 2015 cambray et al 2011 however integron regulation is not fully understood in particular how it influences the dynamics of arg transmission and antibiotic resistance spread understanding the role of integrons within a system is further confused by the fact that many integrons including clinti1 can be found empty e g carrying no args chakraborty et al 2013 chang et al 2007 dillon et al 2005 moura et al 2012 sá et al 2010 toval et al 2015 the incorporation of args into clinti1 also occurs in the absence of antibiotics pérez valdespino et al 2016 suggesting integron and arg ecology are not solely driven by antibiotic use here we examine integron dynamics by quantifying different integrons and microbiota across a wastewater network that includes community and hospital sources sewer lines a wastewater treatment plant wwtp and upstream and downstream receiving waters fig 1 integron types states and possible bacterial hosts called here potential bacteria carrying mobile integrons or pbcmi were compared across compartments the goal was to delineate the spatial dynamics of integrons especially human impacted class 1 integrons to help explain where arg transmission really occurs within wastewater systems however to do this we needed to design new probe primer sets that better segregate clinti1 from inti1 and probes for quantifying class 1 structures that do not carry args 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sampling procedure sampling was performed during the summer in a city in northern spain which has limited heavy industry or agriculture a schematic of the network is shown in fig 1 samples were collected over three weeks including effluents from two hospitals hp a and hp b the parallel community sewer line cm the wwtp influent inf and effluent eff recycled activated sludge ras and the river water column and sediments 100 m upstream ru and sru and downstream rd and srd of the wwtp discharge further details of the wastewater network sampling regime and sample handling and processing methods have been reported previously quintela baluja et al 2019 temperature dissolved oxygen do ph and specific conductivity were measured in situ using hand held probes mettler toledo fg3 fivego and jenway model 350 ph meter 2 2 dna extraction biomass was harvested for dna extraction via vacuum filtration using sterile 0 22 μm membrane disc filters millipore billerica ma usa or by centrifugation at 12 000 rpm for 30 min extraction was performed using the fast dna spin kit for soils mp biomedicals usa according to the manufacturer s instructions dna was stored at 20 c prior to subsequent analysis 2 3 design of new primers and probes to quantify alternate clinical class 1 integron structures the terminology of gillings et al 2008 has been used for many years to define class 1 integron recombination platforms pre clinical class 1 integrons are elements that contain a class 1 integrase which includes a complete tni transposition module pclinti1 conversely clinical class 1 integrons clinti1 contain qaceδ sul1 and orf5 in their structure a random subset of recently published plasmid sequences was examined and it was determined the old primer set for clinti1 poorly discriminated from pclinti1 structures figure s1 tables s1 s3 therefore we designed a new set of primers that are more specific to the qaceδ sul1 and orf5 structure which we call the aint1 assay our new name represents anthropogenically impacted class 1 integrons and is an appropriate name for class 1 integrons that have been impacted by human activity and not just clinical factors in parallel we also designed a new assay for anthropogenic class 1 integrons that do not carry args which we call empty structures eaint1 the design process of the new assays is provided under results 2 4 quantitative pcr assays and related data analysis inti1 inti2 and inti3 as well as aint1 and eaint1 were quantified using the qpcr taqman method table 1 taqman qpcr reactions were conducted using ssoadvanced universal probes supermix biorad employing the following thermocycler program 3 min of initial denaturation at 95 c and 40 cycles of 5 sec denaturation at 95 c and 30 sec annealing extension see temperatures in table 1 in addition total bacteria and total coliforms were quantified using a sybr green based qpcr assay sybr green reactions were conducted using ssoadvanced universal sybr green supermix biorad employing the following thermocycler program 2 min of initial denaturation at 98 c and 40 cycles of 5 sec denaturation at 98 c and 5 sec annealing extension at 60 c total bacteria or 55 c total coliforms the limit of detection lod and limit of quantification loq were calculated using a 2 fold dilution series covering the range of 1 to 500 gene copies gc from each standard and analysed eight times r script available at https github com cmerkes qpcr lod calc the lod was defined as the lowest concentration that can be reliably detected i e at which at least 95 of standard reactions are expected to amplify the loq was defined as the lowest standard that can be quantified with a coefficient of variation less than 0 35 klymus et al 2020 table s4 all assays were carried out in triplicate using the biorad cfx c1000 system biorad hercules ca usa to minimise inhibition extracted dna was diluted to a working concentration of 5 ng ul and a dna internal positive control was used in sybr green reactions briefly an additional reaction was performed for each sample containing 104 genes copies of the green fluorescent protein gene gfp inhibition was considered to be minimal when the difference in ct values δct of gfp between the spiked sample and the positive control was below 1 ct standard curves for each primer set were constructed using plasmid clones of the target sequences these were loaded in triplicate in each qpcr run in parallel with the amplification of test samples all samples were run in triplicate using the optimum qpcr conditions determined for each primer set related statistical analyses and data manipulation were performed using the r environment team 2006 with a significant cutoff of α 0 05 normality and the variance homoscedasticity were tested by the shapiro wilk test and levene s test respectively previous conditions were not met for all integron datasets therefore the krustall wallis test was performed to assess statistically significant differences conover s test was performed for pairwise comparison between sampling sites and adjusted p values were calculated with the holm bonferroni method 2 5 16s rrna gene amplification sequencing and data processing to assess microbial communities pcr amplification of the v4 v5 region of bacterial 16s rrna genes in dna extracts was conducted using fusion primers containing a pgm sequencing adaptor a gt spacer and a unique 12 base pair golay barcode to allow multiplex analyses primers 515f 5 gtgncagcmgccgcggtaa 3 and 926r 5 ccgycaattymtttragttt 3 details of pcr reactions and amplicon quantification are reported elsewhere quintela baluja et al 2019 sequencing was performed using an ion torrent personal genome system life technology with processing performed using a uparse qiime pipeline pylro et al 2014 pylro et al 2016 the operational taxonomic unit otu table was built using the uparse pipeline edgar 2004 sequences were clustered into otus at a 97 similarity cut off checked for chimaeras and reflective sequences were obtained for each phylotype taxonomic classification used qiime caporaso et al 2010 based on the uclust method prasad et al 2015 see quintela baluja et al 2019 for details all data analysis and visualisations were conducted using r team 2006 through the rstudio ide http www rstudio com otu counts and associated taxonomic assignments were imported and merged into a phyloseq object mcmurdie and holmes 2013 all samples were rarefied to ensure the same number of reads per sample 8 577 which corresponded to the sample with the fewest number of sequences resulting in 5 698 unique otus assessment of sample completeness sample coverage and alpha diversity were calculated with the r package inext hsieh et al 2016 alpha diversity was calculated using hill numbers d with q from 0 to 3 and were expressed in units of effective number of species as q increases low abundance otus are assigned less weight while high abundance otus are assigned more weight this enables the investigation of diversity at different scales at q 0 d is simply the number of observed otus richness at q 1 dexp shannon and at q 2 d is equal to inverse simpson s index a cluster dendrogram of community composition dissimilarity bray curtis average neighbour clustering was calculated with the r package vegan oksanen et al 2019 to determine the potential bacteria carrying mobile integrons pbcmis in each compartment consensus sequences from class 1 anthropogenic and non anthropogenic 2 and 3 integrons were aligned against the ncbinr database database accessed on june 2019 using blast mcginnis and madden 2004 accession numbers from sequences with 100 identity were downloaded and taxonomy assigned with the r package taxonomizr only families with more than one entry in the ncbinr database were considered as potential integron hosts and used to filter the otu table from the samples the pbcmis otu level distribution across the network was visualized using a two dimensional hierarchical clustering in conjunction with a heatmap of relative abundances 2 6 biomarker signature analysis linear discriminant analysis effect sizes lefse was employed to identify pbcmi that are statistically significant across sampling locations segata et al 2011 with the normalised relative abundance matrix lefse uses the kruskal wallis rank sum test to detect features with significantly different abundances between the assigned taxa and performs linear discriminant analysis to estimate the effect size of each feature only taxa with average abundances 1 were considered significant a significance level alpha of 0 05 and an effect size threshold of 2x were used for all the biomarkers evaluated in this study 2 7 co occurrence between integrons and microbial taxa a correlation matrix was developed by calculating all possible pairwise spearman s rank correlations among 267 bacterial families the three integrases inti1 inti2 and inti3 and the 3 cs conserved region of aint1 present in samples from the study n 27 a correlation between two items was considered if the spearman s correlation coefficient ρ was 0 5 and the p value was 0 05 to reduce the chances of obtaining false positive results the p values were adjusted with a multiple testing correction using the benjamini hochberg method benjamini and hochberg 1995 the pairwise correlations of the bacterial families and integrases formed their co occurrence networks network analyses were performed in r environment and was further visualised and explored to identify its topological properties i e clustering coefficient shortest average path length and modularity in gephi bastian et al 2009 3 results 3 1 new qpcr probe primer sets for human impacted and empty class 1 integrons although multiple probe primers for class 1 integrons and associated gene cassettes already exist gillings et al 2009 gillings et al 2009 holmes et al 2003 stokes et al 2001 one set has dominated use i e clinti1 hereafter called the old set gillings et al 2015 this old set targets the integron integrase gene 5 cs end however when one compares that target sequence with more recent sequencing data it becomes clear the region does not clearly discriminate between clinical and pre clinical class 1 integrons figure s1 pre clinical here meaning the evolutionary precursor of clinti1 however we identified a conserved 3 cs region i e attc qacδe1 sul1 that is unique to clinical i e human impacted or anthropogenic class 1 integrons see figs 2 and s2 and tables s1 s3 for details using this region we designed and validated a new set of probe primers that better segregate human impacted class 1 from non impacted class 1 structures table 1 the assay design was as follows sequences of each individual region were first aligned using muscle in ugene v 33 to identify optimal target regions for more specific primers figure s2 this revealed selective targets within amplicon containing sequences at intersecting loci between attc qacδe1 and atti attc fig 2 using this region primers and taqman probes were designed using oligoarchitect http www oligoarchitect com with a melting temperature tm of 60 c the selected primers and probes were aligned against ncbi using blast mcginnis and madden 2004 to rule out non specific binding to other bacterial targets we call our new probe primer assay aint1 to avoid confusion with the old set the new probe primer set was assessed in terms of historic clinical and non clinical integron structures tables s2 and s3 and shows aint1 better targets the conserved 3 cs segment of the clinical structure attc qacδe1 sul1 and does not overlap with pre clinical structures henceforth we only refer to aint1 hereafter using a similar approach a new probe primer assay was also designed to quantify empty anthropogenic class i integron structures which we call eaint1 table 1 the need to segregate between empty structures and integrons carrying gcs was evident as all of the empty class i integron structures in our plasmid sequence dataset were associated with anthropogenic class 1 structures the old assay did not uniquely detect anthropogenic class 1 integron structures nor indicate whether they were carrying args in the gc combining aint1 and eaint1 allows one to quantify anthropogenic class 1 integron dynamics more exactly segregating gcs that do not contain args 3 2 integron pool and distribution across our urban wastewater network quantification of integron structures across our wastewater network showed that class 1 integrons were present in all compartments table 2 and s5 fig 3 in contrast class 2 integron levels were low everywhere and below detection in river samples collected upstream of the wastewater effluent discharge point or in the downstream water column class 3 integrons were also low in upstream samples and lower across the wastewater network except in hospital wastewater samples following quantification of integron gene levels per bacterial cell across the network i e as genome equivalent hospital effluents contained significantly higher levels of integron genes per cell p 0 05 much greater than any other compartment fig 3 table 2 metadata on chemical conditions in each compartment is shown in table s6 within the wwtp itself integron abundances decreased between 93 to 98 from influent to effluent log removals of 1 18 0 28 mean sd for inti1 log 1 66 0 26 for inti2 and log 1 21 0 16 for inti3 these removals directly paralleled bacterial removals table 2 and s5 implying the removal of bacterial hosts and mges occur in tandem across the treatment steps this is confirmed by inti1 aint1 and inti3 copies per bacterial cell being roughly constant across the system table s7 despite large reductions in integrons across the wwtp absolute class 1 and 3 integron gene abundances increased in the river downstream of the wwtp suggesting integrons were still reaching the environment the new probe primer design showed that the ratio of aint1 to inti1 did vary across raw wastewater compartments fig 4 a aint1 was the dominant integron structure downstream of the biological wastewater treatment unit p 0 05 fig 4b with relatively low levels of eaint1 in contrast the percentage of eaint1 in ras was consistently higher double that in wwtp influents and hospital samples and much higher than any other compartment fig 4c d except downstream river locations 3 3 identifying potential bacteria carrying mobile integrons pbcmi integrase gene abundance across this wastewater network correlates with the type and abundance of bacterial populations which was previously observed for args within this network quintela baluja et al 2019 therefore data here lends itself well to statistical analysis on most probable populations carrying key integrons especially inti1 vs aint1 vs eaint1 screening of the ncbinr database found 28 potential bacterial families known to host inti1 14 for aint1 6 for inti2 and 4 for inti3 table s8 only inti1 has been previously found in gram positive bacteria whereas the 3 cs conserved region of aint1 has only been found in gram negative bacteria of the identified families with mobile integrons from the database 21 were found in one or more samples in this study table s8 beta diversity analysis was used to compare microbial community diversities among wastewater network locations for this analysis the dataset was re sampled to ensure the same number of reads per sample 8 577 which corresponded to the sample with the fewest number of sequences resulting in 5 698 otus the otus from pbcmi families were filtered and re sampled from the raw reads to the sample with the fewest number of sequences 1 266 resulting in 392 unique otus the percentage of total estimated species richness in each sample resulted in 95 4 99 0 for the total microbial community and 94 4 98 1 for the pbcmi which suggests the overall microbial communities were adequately sampled in both cases table s9 hill number diversity indices were calculated with the parameter q from 0 to 2 note that as q increases rare species are given less weight and contribute less toward the effective number of otus in a sample hill numbers with q equal to 0 and 1 showed that raw wastewater samples had lower diversity compared with upstream river samples both water column and sediment and from the downstream river sediments fig s3 specifically hill numbers q equal to 0 and 1 indicated that bacterial diversity was greater in samples upstream of the wwtp ru sru because of more rare taxa which was not apparent when only pbcmi taxa were considered fig s4 conversely the bray curtis dissimilarity dendrogram showed that total microbial community compositions differed among network compartments which included four main clusters with distinct ecosystems cut off 0 72 fig s5 the first cluster contained samples associated with raw wastewater community hospital and wwtp influent the second cluster contained ras wwtp effluent and the downstream river water and sediment samples the third and fourth clusters included the river water column and sediment samples upstream of the wwtp respectively the pbcmi sub community followed similar patterns but the cut off value of the cluster structure was significantly lower cut off 0 53 this observation in conjunction with evident two dimensional hierarchical clustering seen in the heatmap of pbcmi relative abundances fig s6 suggests that a pbcmi core sub community exists in all network compartments however fig s6 shows that wwtp releases clearly impact river microbial communities increasing pbcmis in the downstream environment figs 5 and s6 the family comamonadaceae is ubiquitous which is often associated with wastewater e g aeromonadaceae and enterobacteriaceae and those more associated with the environment e g rodobacteriaceae or sphingomonadaceae 3 4 microbial communities and their connectivity across the network characterising microbial communities across a wastewater network in terms of diversity evenness and taxonomic composition is key to identifying linkages among compartments and determining microbial contributions from internal versus external sources lefse analysis showed the relative presence of the family erysipelotrichaceae lachnospiraceae bacteroidaceae and ruminococcaceae tend to best define community wastewater in contrast hospital wastewater was characterised by higher abundances of prevotellaceae enterobacteriaceae and desulfovibrionaceae weeksellaceae and moraxellaceae were associated with wwtp influent whereas ras was best defined by rhodobacteraceae frankiaceae dietziaceae gordoniaceae and intrasporangiaceae fig s7 each compartment of the network had characteristic reflective signature families suggesting local enrichment and or selection to examine this we combined the biomarker discovery tool lefse and co occurrence network analysis to assess the relative transmission of args associated with mobile integrons across compartments the co correlation network consists of 259 nodes 255 taxa and 4 mobile integrons and 4 465 edges with an average degree or node connectivity of 34 479 the average network distance between all pairs of nodes average path length was 2 94 edges with a network diameter of 7 edges bacterial families comprising pbcmi that most explain differences between network compartments lefse analysis are highlighted in fig s7 network analysis produced four different modules fig s8 equivalent to the microbial composition dissimilarity clusters the network showed possible arg dissemination pathways via mobile integrons from human associated taxa module i to bacteria in human impacted environments module ii and non human environmental bacteria modules iii and iv lefse analysis revealed that module i include bacterial families defining raw wastewater cm hp and inf and all mobile integrons fig s9a conversely module ii mostly contains ras and river sediment taxa with limited pbcmi contributions ras rd srd and eff emphasising the connectivity of ras bacteria with river sediments fig s8b module iii contains taxa defining the river water column fig s8c finally module iv contains mostly bacterial families in upstream river sediments sru however some bacteria families from the downstream river sediments also are present in module iv fig s8d 4 discussion here we show that inti1 and aint1 dominated all compartments in our wastewater network with inti2 and inti3 being much less abundant at all sampling points all integron markers except for empty structures eaint1 were highest in hospital wastewater where antibiotic use is more intensive escudero oñate et al 2017 rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 this is consistent with previous data that showed the relative number of args per bacterial cell were at least one order of magnitude higher in hospital wastewater compared with the other compartments quintela baluja et al 2019 interestingly while inti2 levels per bacterial cell declined along the wastewater process stream the relative levels of inti1 aint1 and inti3 per cell did not change amongst compartments except in upstream river samples consistently low levels of inti2 are probably due to it typically lacking a functional integrase meaning it cannot catalyse recombination reactions alone deng et al 2015 it is noteworthy that inti3 was detected across the whole wastewater network and roughly mirrored inti1 patterns although abundances were about 20 times lower than inti1 the ubiquitous presence of inti3 here contrasts with results of stalder et al 2014 who found inti3 levels decreased across their wwtp this may be due to differences in inti3 found in the two studies or differences between the local wastewater systems inti3 performs a similar function to inti1 although its recombination frequencies have historically been lower stokes and gillings 2011 which makes inti3 less associated with bacterial adaptation under adverse conditions empty human impacted class 1 integron structures have been found previously malek et al 2015 mokracka et al 2012 moura et al 2012 sá et al 2010 toval et al 2015 but here we more exactly quantified levels of eaint1 vs aint1 and inti1 we had expected to find higher relative abundances of eaint1 cassettes in hospital wastewater it was hypothesized that the presence of higher concentrations of antibiotics and other bioactive agents would select for cellular defence gcs and trigger sos responses that would activate integrase aint1 expression cambray 2011 but instead the highest relative abundances of eaint1 cassettes were found in ras samples suggesting this is where empty cassettes accumulate or more likely arg carriage is not a selection factor for bacterial hosts that reside in ras ras appears to have a reduced tendency for class 1 integrons or their hosts to retain args although the scale of differences may be specific to our network we suggest hospital wastewaters tend to select and retain a greater array of defence genes in their aint1 due to greater stressors in their environment e g therapeutic drugs and or richer organic carbon levels wastes dominated by faeces from patients similar uniqueness of hospital wastewater was also seen in sweden kraupner et al 2021 conversely bacteria in ras grow under nutrient limited conditions and under longer residence times e g than a gut environment thus ras bacteria are under persistent nutrient stress compared to the gut most activated sludge wwtps recycle ras for days rather than hours under comparatively dilute but fluctuating biotic and abiotic conditions such conditions might promote rearrangement in aint1 and loss of args but apparently not reacquisition possibly because selective agents e g antibiotics are more dilute or not bioavailable the high prevalence of empty cassettes in ras and their apparent low presence in the wwtp effluents has important implications to pathways of integron mediated arg spread from wwtps to the environment until now only two studies have used high throughput sequencing to study inti1 cassette diversity in environmental samples gatica et al 2016 stalder et al 2014 while stalder et al 2014 sequenced clone libraries of inti1 cassettes from wastewater compartments gatica et al 2016 targeted recombination sites that flank the gene cassettes of inti1 genes in wwtp effluents both studies found a high diversity of gene cassettes however many of their detected sequences had unknown functions stalder et al 2014 found their wwtp tended to reduce the diversity of gene cassette arrays relative to raw wastewater and had elevated levels of empty cassettes whereas gatica et al 2016 showed a marginal persistence of β lactam resistance gene cassettes in soil microbiomes impacted by wwtp effluents work here shows the nature and content of integron structures and associated microbial communities differ widely across compartments further confirming local evolutionary ecosystems drive selection in sub ecosystems embedded within larger networks baquero et al 2008 quintela baluja et al 2019 local ecosystems and their communities are spatially separate and each is driven by different habitat and other selective factors this includes specific community selection munck et al 2015 and arg carriage quintela baluja et al 2019 parallel differences exist among prevalent mobile integrons and their state relative to arg carriage empty or not however even though different wastewater compartments have different communities continual hydraulic interconnection allows microbial dispersal and gene flow which explains linkages among local resistomes including local mobile integrons co occurrence analysis fig s s8 and s9 highlights the association of pbcmis within microbial communities in raw wastewater especially compared with communities less impacted by raw wastewater the importance of this observation is most evident in river sediments where resident bacteria and their mobile integrons reflect unsettled floc in wwtp effluents as such sediments may be place of environmental arg transfer although there would need to be selective drivers for gene acquisition to occur such as other pollutants in the sediments our previous work supported this hypothesis where downstream sediments were largely comprised of ras bacteria quintela baluja et al 2019 a recent study by di cesare et al 2020 supported this hypothesis by showing that the vertical distribution of inti1 in lake sediments mirrored the deposition of bacteria from the water column and to sediments below consistent with previous work sediments downstream of our wwtp were enriched in args probably due to outputs from the wwtp di cesare et al 2020 quintela baluja et al 2019 which is consistent with greater abundances of aint1 compared with upstream sediments although it is speculation we suspect the co release of potentially selective agents in wwtp effluents might further promote such persistence specifically the dynamic process of gene cassette acquisition in aint1 and the presence of a qac gene in its structure resistance to biocides potentially confers advantageous phenotypes that may be behind the fixation and spread of this integron structure gillings et al 2009 a noteworthy new observation here which supports the potential for arg transfer in sediments downstream of wwtps is elevated levels of eaint1 the two compartments with the highest relative levels of empty clinical class 1 integron cassettes are the ras and downstream sediments which implies they are hydraulically connected and may be locations of reacquisition of args due to higher levels of empty mobile integrons a comparison of microbial communities between ras and downstream sediments quintela baluja et al 2019 furthers shows this connection and suggests downstream sediments could be locations of elevated horizontal gene transfer 5 conclusions here we show that integrons have their own ecology within a wastewater network and can be used to speculate on the dynamics of args within such systems however integron dynamics appear more complex than previously reported especially the spatial distribution of args and relationships with human impacted and empty class 1 integron cassettes this recognition was only possible by developing a more exact probe primers for anthropogenic class 1 integrons that better segregate class 1 integron types and determine whether they carry args or not we are clearly getting closer to understanding what really happens in wastewater networks relative to amr spread but new evidence here suggests arg transmission in wastewater networks may differ than previously beleived regardless we hope this work will guide new and

16543,diversion of organic waste from landfills offers an opportunity to recover valuable nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus that are typically discarded although prior research has explored the potential for buildout of anaerobic digestion ad infrastructure to treat organic waste and generate energy a better understanding is needed of the nutrient recovery potential from the solid and liquid byproducts digestate resulting from ad of these waste streams we quantified the system wide mass of nutrients that can potentially be recovered in california by integrating current and potential future ad facilities with existing nutrient recovery technologies based on a profitable build out scenario for ad the potential for nitrogen and phosphorus recovery by mass was greatest from municipal sewage sludge the nutrient recovery total mass was determined for three different end products for the combined organic waste streams liquid fertilizer 38 of the total recovered nitrogen tn struvite 50 tn 66 total phosphorous tp and compost 12 tn 34 tp based on the profitable build out scenario of ad facilities in california the recovered nutrients would offset an estimated 11 of tn and 29 of tp of in state synthetic fertilizer demand whereas a scenario in which all technically recoverable biomass is collected and treated could offset 44 of tn and 97 of tp demand graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anaerobic digestion resource recovery nutrient management struvite precipitation ammonia stripping 1 introduction anaerobic digestion ad is widely used to treat a range of organic waste streams in california three recent senate bills are likely to spur additional investments in ad of organic waste by providing targets and guidance to reduce methane emissions from manure and landfills senate bill 1383 in 2016 increase renewable energy production senate bill 100 in 2018 and control burning of agricultural and forestry waste senate bill 1260 in 2018 for example to meet the 2025 goal of 75 organic waste diversion from landfills in senate bill 1383 calrecycle estimates that new infrastructure is needed to increase digester capacity from 1 1 million tons to 5 1 million tons per year of organic waste calrecycle 2020 meeting the 2025 goal with ad infrastructure would also increase biomethane production to approximately 400 million cubic meters calrecycle 2020 separate from efforts to divert municipal organic waste construction of dairy digesters has accelerated in california driven by large greenhouse gas offset credits for renewable natural gas awarded through the low carbon fuel standards for diverting manure from lagoons california air resources board 2018 additionally a previous study by members of our research team explored the total quantity of organic waste in california that could be treated in waste to energy systems and the resulting energy potential breunig et al 2017 the waste streams in this previous analysis were animal manure am agri food process residues af agricultural crop residue ac and organic municipal solid waste omsw an anticipated challenge from the expansion of ad as a method for treating organic waste is that it generates a liquid digestate with a high nutrient content lukehurst et al 2010 the nutrients in this digestate if directly discharged would be added to the existing 9 of wastewater nitrogen that is already discharged to land and another 9 that is discharged to inland surface water in california tomich et al 2015 disposal of digestate derived from organic waste to the environment could further exacerbate eutrophication which can lead to harmful algal blooms and have large economic repercussions to fisheries tourism property values and recreation perry and lubchenco 2017 water environment federation 2014 the negative consequences of nutrient pollution may be intensified by rising temperatures and a growing world population larsen et al 2016 regulatory frameworks are already being considered in california to further reduce nutrient loads from point sources like wastewater to water bodies like san francisco bay ebmud 2017 the challenge of managing the liquid digestate may also represent an opportunity if the nutrients can be recovered to offset the use of synthetic fertilizers which are manufactured through energy intensive processes and non renewable resources maurer et al 2003 the haber bosch process used to fix nitrogen from the atmosphere consumes large quantities of natural gas and accounts for 1 2 of total global energy demand philibert 2018 phosphorus a finite resource is almost exclusively mined from mineral deposits cordell et al 2009 one option for nutrient recovery is direct land application of the liquid digestates however when compared to mineral fertilizer disadvantages of direct land application include lower fertilizer value higher potential for ammonia loss higher transportation costs odors and additional undesirable constituents like metals and organic pollutants leverenz et al 2019 nkoa 2014 alternatively the nutrients in the digestate can be further concentrated to generate fertilizer products campos et al 2019 and offset the economic and environmental costs of purchased synthetic fertilizer khoshnevisan et al 2018 combined with the nutrients present in the solid digestate i e biosolids which can also be applied to land there is potential to develop highly efficient systems for nutrient cycling campos et al 2019 tonini et al 2013 while other studies have estimated global nutrient recovery potential from wastewater trimmer et al 2017 and highlighted the ability of individual nutrient management technologies to recover nitrogen and phosphorus from organic waste streams campos et al 2019 ma et al 2018 tonini et al 2013 to our knowledge no study to date has complemented existing organic waste diversion efforts via a rigorous organic waste inventory combined with the large scale e g state or country wide potential for nutrient recovery from the resulting digestate the promise for this overall approach is recognized in the united nations un sustainable development goals and the united states national academy of engineering nae grand challenges which both contain targets for sustainably recovering resources like nutrients and energy from waste streams perry and lubchenco 2017 rosa 2017 thus utilizing ad integrated with additional nutrient management technologies can address multiple un sustainable development goals and nae grand challenges related to food energy water poverty mitigation waste reduction and climate change the overall goal of the study presented here was to quantify the mass of nitrogen and phosphorus that can be recovered from organic waste streams by integrating nutrient recovery with ad to make this question more tractable to answer we focused specifically on nutrient recovery potential in california using scenarios for 2020 and 2050 specific objectives of the study were to 1 quantify the nutrient content and total mass of the key organic waste streams 2 determine the fate of nitrogen and phosphorus during ad solid liquid separation and nutrient recovery from the solid and liquid streams and 3 compare the quantity of recovered nutrients with the quantity of purchased synthetic fertilizer the results provide insights that are relevant for other regions and the methodology can be adapted to quantify nutrient recovery potential for other types or mixtures of organic wastes and to model different nutrient recovery technologies as more information is gained on their performance the state of california was chosen to explore the question of nutrient recovery and use because in addition to producing the greatest quantity of organic waste of any state tomich et al 2015 and making available a wealth of data it has existing inefficiencies in nutrient cycling and has implemented strong policies to increase the recovery of energy and other value added products from organic waste in a recent nitrogen mass balance for the state of california the mass of nitrogen imported as synthetic fertilizer 37 was similar to that lost to the atmosphere nox n2 and nh3 42 through fossil fuel combustion energy generation and emissions from animal manure and fertilizer tomich et al 2015 there is also significant leaching of nitrogen into groundwater 16 recovering nutrients from organic waste streams has the potential to improve nutrient cycling by reducing the use of synthetic fertilizer and decreasing losses to the atmosphere and groundwater bodirsky et al 2014 2 materials and methods the methodology to quantify the mass of nitrogen and phosphorus that can be recovered from organic waste streams treated with ad integrated with nutrient recovery is shown in fig 1 multiple organic streams can be used as digester influent the digester produces biogas and a nutrient rich liquid effluent which can be separated into liquids and solids for further treatment the produced quantity of liquid and solid fertilizer was compared with the quantity of synthetic fertilizer purchased for in state use the quantity of nutrients that can be recovered in california assuming biomass production rates forecasted for 2020 and 2050 was calculated for a baseline scenario scenario 1 based on our literature review we determined other common technology options and integrated them into additional scenarios alternate separation processes scenarios 2a e alternate liquid nutrient recovery processes scenarios 3a c and an alternate solids treatment scenario 4 the processes assumptions equations and calculations involved in each step are summarized in table 1 and detailed in the sub sections below 2 1 organic waste streams anaerobic digesters can be used to stabilize a wide range of organic waste streams such as am ac af omsw and municipal sewage sludge mss lukehurst et al 2010 these five organic waste streams were chosen as they represent the largest organic waste streams by mass available for nutrient recovery three projections were used to represent the potential availability of organic waste streams in 2020 and 2050 gross technical and market gross refers to the total mass of the organic waste stream including waste currently collected and not currently collected and the technical portion is the fraction of the gross mass that would be feasible to collect can be used as an input into ad and is not used in another market market refers to the in state biomass that could be profitably diverted from the organic waste stream based on current cost estimates and a range of electricity selling prices combined market and policy related revenues per the lawrence berkeley national laboratory lbnl organics recycling facility investment model scown et al 2019 smith et al 2021 low and high market scenarios are modeled based on biomethane prices mcf of 15 and 25 respectively in 2020 and 12 and 60 respectively in 2050 the low price values are intended to represent expected energy market prices while the high price values are intended to reflect prices that could be achieved through a mix of consumer renewable energy mark ups and monetary environmental subsidies it should be noted that these market scenarios are conservative as they only consider potential profit driven private sector investment in ad facilities rather than the aggressive infrastructure investments that will likely be required to meet state landfill diversion goals the mass of organic wastes m produced in each year in wet and bone dry mg were previously calculated for am ac af and omsw for the years 2020 and 2050 breunig et al 2017 the largest contributor to the am category was dairy manure the ac category included culls from 39 food crops and residue from 51 food crops including almonds hay grapes and rice the af category included residues from 17 categories such as almond shells almond hulls brewery waste walnut shells and rice hulls lastly the omsw category contained categories such as green waste and food waste mss is currently treated in california at several hundred wastewater treatment plants through processes such as ad aerobic digestion sludge lagoons chemical oxidation and lime stabilization crites and tchobanoglous 1998 the mss that is currently anaerobically digested at 130 california facilities was considered to represent both the technical and market biomass as the facilities are already built and operated breunig et al 2017 the gross biomass kg day of mss includes the remaining wwtps that do not anaerobically digest their sludge and therefore was calculated based on existing total flow at each of california s 497 wastewater treatment plants in 2012 table s1 epa 2012 the mass of nutrients n per wet mass of biomass was estimated from published values identified through a comprehensive review of literature for total nitrogen tn ammonium nitrogen nh4 n and total phosphorus tp in each organic waste stream table 1 contains an overview of the categories units outputs parameters and supplementary tables tables s1 s21 detailed calculations and literature values are found in the supplementary tables it was assumed that tp was predominantly po4 3 p due to sparse literature on phosphate concentrations in organic waste streams nutrient mass concentration table s22 varies widely for different sub categories of some waste streams e g meat waste vs fruit waste for af however ad facilities typically take in a wide range of these wastes and do not have information about the specific breakdown therefore average values were calculated for each waste stream as a whole 2 2 anaerobic digestion types ad is used to stabilize solids and produce biogas that can be used as an energy resource breunig et al 2017 during the digestion process organic nitrogen and phosphorus are typically converted into inorganic ammonium and phosphate respectively orner et al 2020 two types of ad used to process organic waste streams are dry ad and wet ad dry ad facilities as well as stand alone wet ad facilities i e not part of a municipal wastewater treatment plant are a growing sector particularly in california where facilities are being built to handle more diverse waste streams to aid in landfill diversion calrecycle 2020 goldstein 2018 satchwell et al 2018 dry ad or wet ad may be more viable for some organic waste streams over others see tables 2 s5 because digestates have different biological chemical and physical properties mss am slurries and high moisture af are often treated with wet ad wet ad can also co digest sewage sludge with waste organics from food processing facilities at wwtps to provide benefits such as increased methane production lee et al 2019 food only omsw e g cafeteria or grocery store waste can often go to wet ad while mixed or co mingled omsw including green waste paper products etc would typically go to dry ad higher solids am and ac are commonly treated with dry ad though liquid can be added during wet ad to treat some higher solids wastes published literature was reviewed to determine the percent recovery ad of tn nh4 n and tp during ad although nutrient recovery percentages during ad are likely dependent on context specific factors such as initial nutrient content solid content operation temperature and hydrolysis extent currently this level of context specific data is unavailable for all combinations of the context specific factors therefore more general percent nutrient recovery data was used without substantial evidence to suggest differences we assume that nutrient recovery percentages in wet ad holds true for dry ad even though tn and tp content is generally maintained during ad digestate from wet ad has a much higher water content than dry ad therefore the concentration of nutrients may be higher in dry ad than wet ad which will impact subsequent separation and nutrient recovery xu et al 2018 a review of literature indicated that after ad approximately 89 of tn and 95 of tp end up in the digestate effluent and the percentage of nh4 341 and po4 3 140 table s23 increases from the digester influent to the digester effluent due to the digestion of organic nitrogen and phosphorus orner et al 2020 2 3 separation processes the nutrient rich digestate that leaves the anaerobic digester can be separated into its liquid and solid components for further treatment and easier transport lukehurst et al 2010 sanscartier et al 2012 separation has the benefits of producing a liquid stream from which nutrients are efficiently recovered other benefits of separation may include improved matching of liquid and solid products to crop needs reduced storage and transportation volume and reduced stirring moller and muller 2012 types of physical separation processes include belt press sieve drum screw press sieve centrifuge decanter centrifuge and brushed screen the separator equipment can be classified as low performance e g screw press which are typically used for feedstocks with high solids content or high performance e g centrifuge rotary drum which are generally used for low solids feedstocks guilayn et al 2019 high solids digestates may have clogging issues in high performance separation processes hjorth et al 2010 the effluent of dry ad will likely require less separation of liquids and solids than wet ad due to its lower water content thereby reducing costs from energy use riya et al 2020 it is also possible to couple low performance separation e g screw press of the digestate followed by high performance separation e g sieve or centrifuge of the subsequent liquid fraction guilayn et al 2019 in california the most common type of separation process utilized is the screw press therefore the screw press was chosen as the separation process for each digestate in the baseline scenario guilayn et al 2019 decanter centrifuges are the most effective at separating phosphorus into the solid form however it has the highest costs for both construction and operation and is therefore typically only used for very large systems lukehurst et al 2010 nonmechanical methods such as polymer additives can improve separation hjorth et al 2010 a literature review was utilized to determine the percentage of nutrients allocated to liquids l and solids s the sum must add to 100 the effectiveness of separation processes varies widely when digestate is separated the percentage of tn in the liquid can range from 68 belt press to 86 sieve drum brushed screen likewise the percentage of tp in the liquid can range from 29 decanter centrifuge to 84 brushed screen table s24 the nutrient recovery percentage during alternative separation processes were calculated in scenarios 2a e 2 4 nutrient recovery processes for liquids once separation has occurred the liquid digestate rich in nh4 and po4 3 is available for further treatment and nutrient recovery brändli et al 2007 example liquid nutrient recovery technologies include struvite precipitation ammonia stripping and thermal distillation vaneeckhaute et al 2017 the precipitation of struvite mgnh4po4 6h2o has been commercialized at full scale for fertilizer production at industrial and municipal wastewater treatment plants ostara 2021 and struvite can also be recovered from am digestate orner et al 2020 the precipitation process often requires the addition of magnesium and a base to recover nh4 and po4 3 in the form of struvite fertilizer le corre et al 2009 ammonia stripping which involves transferring nh3 aq into a gaseous phase at high ph followed by absorption back into an acidic liquid phase to stabilize it as nh4 requires the addition of a base and an acid e g sulfuric acid or nitric acid and can be used to produce a liquid fertilizer e g ammonium sulfate or ammonium nitrate vaneeckhaute et al 2017 this technology has also been commercialized at full scale e g anaergia to recover up to 90 of nh4 anaergia 2020 thermal distillation utilizes heat to promote evaporation of nh3 aq followed by condensation and can be combined with an acid to produce a liquid fertilizer such as ammonium sulfate or ammonium phosphate tun et al 2016 thermal distillation has achieved 95 nh4 recovery from digestate at the pilot scale 7500 gal d and is currently being implemented at full scale leverenz et al 2021 2019 technologies such as ion exchange tarpeh et al 2018 and the vuna process which uses partial nitrification activated carbon filtration and distillation to capture nutrients and eliminate pathogens vuna 2020 are viable for recovering nutrients from urine but have not yet been widely tested on digestate and are therefore not considered further here liquid nutrient recovery processes such as struvite precipitation simoes et al 2018 ammonia stripping anaergia 2020 and thermal distillation leverenz et al 2021 recover phosphorus and nitrogen at different efficiencies table s25 a review of literature was used to determine the percent nutrient recovery of each liquid nutrient recovery process struvite precipitation is the most effective at recovering tp 75 while also recovering some tn 10 to remove additional tn ammonia stripping and thermal distillation can be used as a second treatment step liquid nutrients were allocated to a liquid nutrient recovery process for the baseline scenario based on which technology had the highest recovery percentage as reported in literature nitrogen thermal distillation and phosphorus struvite leverenz et al 2021 simoes et al 2018 nutrient recovery for alternative processes were calculated in scenarios 3a c 2 5 nutrient recovery processes for solids multiple processes exist for further treating the biosolids class b biosolids that have detectable levels of pathogens can be land applied with restrictions whereas class a biosolids that have undetectable levels of pathogens can be land applied without restriction us epa 1992 land applied biosolids would theoretically recover all nutrients composting the biosolids has the potential to further inactivate pathogens through sufficient time and temperature grewal et al 2006 and produce a soil amendment often through the addition of a bulking agent bustamante et al 2013 landfilling biosolids requires transport and landfill space while offering no recovery a literature review was utilized to determine the percent nutrient recovery of each solid treatment process sr table s21 tiquia and tam 2000 in the baseline scenario all solid digestate is assumed to be composted to meet class a designation which would allow unrestricted land application in agriculture in scenario 4 the nutrient recovery percentage is calculated assuming the digested solids do not receive further treatment 2 6 produced quantity and desired quantity of nutrients for fertilizer adding the mass of recovered nutrients from liquid treatment to the mass of recovered nutrients from solid treatment results in the produced quantity of recovered nutrients np that can be used as fertilizer the produced quantity was compared to the desired quantity of nutrients nd represented in this study as the mass of purchased synthetic fertilizer we assume that the produced quantity could be used as a 1 1 offset of synthetic fertilizer while this is likely reasonable for the concentrated fertilizers produced from the separated liquid digestate nutrients in compost may not be fully utilized in all locations as farmers may require more concentrated products or more consistent nutrient uptake depending on their crop the mass of synthetic fertilizer was calculated by multiplying the average mass of nutrients in purchased synthetic fertilizer breunig et al 2019 california department of food and agriculture 2016 tomich et al 2015 by a growth factor 1 8 assumed between 2015 and 2020 and 15 5 between 2020 and 2050 based on the projected percent increase in gross agricultural crops in california breunig et al 2017 2 7 sensitivity analysis a sensitivity analysis was conducted for each process technology by adding or subtracting one standard deviation from the mean nutrient recovery the sensitivity factor sf was calculated by dividing the percent change in output by the percent change in input a higher sf indicates a more sensitive process technology because there was insufficient information regarding the variability of nitrogen recovery by thermal distillation a standard deviation of 20 was assumed in accordance with prior practice kavvada et al 2017 3 results and discussion in the subsequent sections we explore in detail the model results starting with characterization of the different organic waste streams then following the nutrients through each step of treatment needed for fertilizer production 3 1 organic waste streams the produced daily biomass that was feasible to treat by ad in the 2020 high market model scenario for organic waste streams encompassed by mss am ac af and omsw was 9 4 gg 9400 mg which was only 11 of the daily gross biomass of 87 gg fig 2 omsw 44 was the largest contributor due to the high intake tonnages possible when the renewable electricity is valued above market in the low market scenario as defined by the lower value of the electricity produced by ad mss was the largest contributor of daily biomass at 55 2 5 out of 4 5 gg followed by af 25 and omsw 19 the large contribution from mss can be mainly attributed to the abundance of existing infrastructure to treat mss at municipal wastewater treatment facilities in 2050 the modeled daily gross biomass of organic waste was 99 gg the largest contributors in the high market scenario in 2050 were omsw 37 and af 24 although ac 13 and am 9 became larger contributors in this scenario the percent contributions of each organic waste stream varied widely in the gross technical and market scenarios due to the differences in feasibility and cost of collection transportation and treatment it was estimated to be technically feasible to collect and therefore send to ad processes about a third of the organic wastes due primarily to limitations in the feasibility of collecting agricultural on field residues lack of digesters at smaller wastewater treatment facilities and the difficulties of collecting post consumer waste streams that are reasonably uncontaminated breunig et al 2017 additionally not all organic waste is viable for anaerobic digestion e g cardboard and lumber table s5 the technical scenario only included organic wastes not included in another market organic wastes that were already re applied to land were excluded however to fully utilize the energy and nutrient recovery potential in these wastes ad facilities must be built in significant quantities which requires either a viable profitable business opportunity or significant public sector organization and investment these opportunities appear to be limited currently which results in the low market scenario tonnages shown in this work though as organics waste diversion policies increase in scope and enforcement as is ongoing in california the amount of waste sent to ad facilities will likely trend closer to the technically recoverable quantities for example the mass of omsw in the 2020 market high scenario is projected to increase from 4 1 to 6 3 gg d by 2050 even though the technical quantity only increases from 7 5 to 7 7 gg d in the same period due to more viable business opportunities driven by policies such as sb 1383 if the mass of all recovered organic waste transitioned from the high market quantity to the technical quantity the mass would quadruple 9 to 33 gg d in 2020 and more than double 17 to 38 gg d in 2050 the majority of organic waste and its embedded nutrients in the gross scenario in fig 2 that is currently not technically recoverable is often discharged to surface water or disposed of at landfills further discussed in section s1 discharging organic waste streams to the environment can contribute to eutrophication while disposing at landfills can increase greenhouse gas emissions cal recycle 2020 alternatively direct land application of organic waste while providing benefits of returning beneficial nutrients to crops has limitations such as uncertain nutrient quantities and nutrient transfer application restrictions for food ground crops and potential exceedances of water quality regulations conijn et al 2018 given the market biomass for each organic waste stream and their corresponding nutrient mass concentrations and total solids percentages table s22 the nutrient loadings mg day to anaerobic digesters in the 2020 high market scenario were 204 for tn fig 3 a 117 for nh4 n and 76 for tp fig 3b together omsw and mss made up 80 of feedstock for tn and 88 for tp mss was the largest contributor for tn 55 and tp 75 in 2050 the total nutrient loadings mg day almost doubled to 361 for tn fig 3c 195 for nh4 n and 122 for tp fig 3d whereas ac contributed a negligible percentage of tn and tp in 2020 in 2050 the contributions were estimated to be 12 of tn and 6 of tp although a larger mass of organic waste was available from omsw than the from the other waste streams in the high market scenario fig 2 more nutrients were available from mss fig 3 because mss was the highest strength waste g of tn nh4 n and tp per kg organic dry weight mss contained 46 g tn kg followed by am ac omsw and af 37 9 19 7 12 0 and 10 8 g tn kg respectively the significant nutrient fluxes from streams other than mss fig 3 signal an opportunity to provide infrastructure to recover nutrients from these alternate streams 3 2 nutrient recovery for the remainder of the analysis only the high market scenario is presented to calculate nutrient recovery potential because we believe it is the most representative future scenario in between the low market scenario and what is technically feasible a detailed summary of the input values and results for the entire high market analysis is provided in fig s1 the comparable calculations and results for the technical scenario are presented in fig s2 in fig 3 the mass of nutrients recovered from each organic waste stream through each treatment step anaerobic digestion table s23 solid liquid separation table s24 and nutrient recovery table s25 is presented under the high market scenario in 2020 treating all the organic waste streams with ad would produce a digestate that contains 182 mg day of tn and 72 mg day of tp fig 3a and b if these nutrient rich digestates become runoff much of the nutrients would likely reach surface waters contributing to widespread eutrophication to evaluate the potential for nutrient recovery from digestate the baseline treatment process was solid liquid separation by screw press followed by composting of the solids and struvite precipitation and thermal distillation for the liquid stream the result was 131 mg day of tn struvite plus distillate and 38 g day of tp struvite that can be recovered from the liquid digestate fig 3a and 3b the composting step for solids treatment reduced the nitrogen recovery 53 of tn compared to no treatment of solids table s25 which resulted in 19 mg day of tn and 21 mg day of tp in the recovered compost the combined produced quantity of nutrients for fertilizer was 150 mg day of tn and 59 mg day of tp in 2020 fig s3 the majority of the tn came from mss 60 and omsw 26 the majority of the tp came from mss 75 approximately 88 of the combined quantity of tn was derived from the liquid digestate in the form of solid struvite fertilizer and liquid distillate fig 3a the ammonium in the liquid distillate can be recovered with acids to produce liquid fertilizers such as ammonium sulfate and ammonium phosphate similarly approximately 64 of the combined quantity of tp is derived from the liquid digestate fig 3b as a result the compost recovered from separated solids has only 12 of the tn and 36 of the tp that was present in the original waste stream it is interesting to note that the five organic waste streams have varied n p molar ratios after the anaerobic digestion step table s22 while the n p molar ratios in mss 4 7 and am 5 5 are lower the n p molar ratio in ac 14 8 omsw 13 0 and af 24 4 are much higher the n p molar ratio may be expected to vary between dry ad digestate and wet ad digestate as dry ad can accept a wider variety of organic wastes than wet ad an n p molar ratio of near one is beneficial for struvite precipitation due to the stoichiometric ratio of 1 1 n p in the mineral when the n p molar ratio is higher an alternative or additional technology is needed to increase the recovery of nitrogen as demonstrated in this analysis by ammonia stripping or thermal distillation to put the quantities of nutrients that can potentially be recovered from ad in perspective we provide a comparison to purchases of synthetic fertilizer the amount of synthetic fertilizer bought in california in 2015 was 1320 mg per day of tn and 200 mg per day of tp the amount of tn and tp in purchased synthetic fertilizer is expected to rise to 1340 mg per day and 205 mg per day by 2020 respectively our overall model results indicate that the potential for production of fertilizer from organic wastes in california would offset 11 of tn and 29 of tp of synthetic fertilizer purchases in the high market scenario for ad in 2020 in a similar model for the year 2050 organic production of fertilizer would offset 17 of the desired 1550 mg of tn and 40 of the desired 237 mg of tp the offset would be greater if all technically feasible organic waste was treated by ad with nutrient recovery 44 of tn and 97 of tp in synthetic fertilizers fig s2 in the technical scenario in 2020 animal manure is the leading contributor of nitrogen 41 and phosphorus 54 fig s4 therefore an important opportunity exists to offset or even replace purchased synthetic fertilizer by implementing nitrogen and phosphorus recovery technologies to treat digestate derived from organic waste streams however the absence of strong market drivers such as greenhouse gas offset credits currently limits the potential for ad which inherently limits the potential for nutrient recovery via treatment of the digestate in addition to the baseline scenario we evaluated alternate technology options for solid liquid separation treatment of the liquid digestate and treatment of the solids the results are summarized in table 2 and compared to the baseline scenario already presented in which 79 of tn and 79 of tp can be recovered from the input organic waste streams scenario 1 separation process did not impact overall tn recovery but shifted the percent recovered between the products recovered from the liquid and the solid tp recovery varied depending on the process chosen scenarios 2a e as compared to the affordable and ubiquitous screw press use of a decanter centrifuge contributed to recovery of an additional 9 of tp due to its high speed centrifugation causing more phosphorus to end up in the solid form where it is more effectively recovered scenario 2d therefore this technology may be of interest to wet ad facilities in the future if phosphorus fertilizers become a valuable byproduct however while more phosphorus was technically recovered in the solid form through compost the phosphorus recovered through the liquid digestate is in a more consistent form that could provide greater value both economically and environmentally as it is more likely to be suitable for use as a drop in fertilizer replacement eliminating a secondary liquid treatment step that includes nitrogen recovery thermal distillation dropped the tn recovery percentage from 79 to 16 scenario 3a likewise eliminating struvite precipitation reduced the tp recovery percentage from 79 to 30 scenario 3b facilities nonetheless may choose to invest in only one of these processes depending on the relative cost and resource energy and material intensity of each and the fertilizer markets available to them lastly eliminating composting as a final treatment step for solids improved the tn recovery percentage from 79 to 88 but the recovered product may have restrictions for land application due to higher pathogen risk scenario 4 3 3 sensitivity analysis the output of a sensitivity analysis of process technologies on recovery of tn and tp is shown in table s26 note that the overall tn and tp recovery was the combined recovery from products derived from both the separated liquids and solids the tn recovery percentage was most sensitive to variability in nutrient recovery in the anaerobic digester sf 0 80 a drop from 89 tn recovery to 69 recovery during ad resulted in a decrease in overall tn recovery from 81 to 65 separation sf 0 36 nutrient recovery via thermal distillation sf 0 35 and composting sf 0 20 had moderate sensitivity the sensitivity of liquid nitrogen recovery via struvite precipitation sf 0 02 was low because nitrogen that was not recovered in struvite was recovered by thermal distillation in contrast liquid nutrient recovery via struvite precipitation sf 0 65 ad sf 0 56 composting sf 0 32 and separation via screw press sf 0 21 all moderately affected tp recovery given the low confidence in the variability of nitrogen recovery by thermal distillation and the sensitivity of the overall recovery to this process more effort should be devoted to developing and characterizing this process 3 4 implications of nutrient management and future research anaerobic digesters are increasingly being used to treat multiple organic waste streams and nutrient recovery can complement existing energy recovery at these facilities to offset synthetic fertilizer production and reduce eutrophication potential wastewater treatment plants like east bay municipal utility district ebmud in oakland ca are already augmenting their existing anaerobic digesters with food waste to increase biogas production other treatment plants such as madison metropolitan sewerage district s nine springs plant in madison wi produce struvite from the liquid stream of their anaerobic digesters integrating nutrient recovery from both the solid and liquid digestate streams at treatment plants in california could considerably offset synthetic fertilizer purchases given that synthetic fertilizer represents 37 of all nitrogen imports in ca and 11 of tn was offset in the 2020 high market scenario tomich et al 2015 likewise capturing nitrogen as fertilizer could reduce nitrogen losses to the environment for example n2 gas represents 13 of california nitrogen exports tomich et al 2015 and n2 emissions during mainstream nitrification denitrification could be reduced through sidestream nutrient recovery from mss via ad the key inputs and losses from the nitrogen cycle in california are similar to those in europe and asia although california has relatively higher amounts of nitrogen that enter groundwater tomich et al 2015 ad is already used extensively in california primarily to treat mss at wastewater treatment facilities and in some cases as dedicated facilities for energy production the total mass of nutrients that can be recovered at wwtp could be increased by supplementing mss with other waste streams such as omsw which had much larger nitrogen fluxes largely due to its higher gross mass and nitrogen mass concentration fig 2 table s22 many of the existing anaerobic digesters that treat mss have the capacity to treat additional organic waste beyond what is currently processed thus efforts to utilize this existing infrastructure can increase the ability to recover nutrients as well as energy from other organic waste streams breunig et al 2017 additional work is needed to compare and spatially optimize the mass of recovered nutrients from existing digesters in california with the demand for nutrients in agricultural production thereby effectively matching potential supply with existing demand that is currently met with synthetic fertilizers although we focused on nitrogen and phosphorus in this manuscript because they are the main constituents by mass in synthetic fertilizers and because their recovery could prevent eutrophication the fate of other minerals such as potassium and calcium also merit further study while fertilizer products produced via ammonia stripping or thermal distillation would not contain these minerals potassium can be found in k struvite and calcium often forms other precipitates with phosphorus the approach presented in this paper can be used to estimate the nutrient recovery potential from these five organic waste streams in other states and regions for example because 90 of california is sewered tomich et al 2015 compared to 76 nationally wastewater treatment population connected 2020 relatively more mss is available in california than in other states likewise california produces 21 of u s dairy commodities tomich et al 2015 while only having 12 of the u s population resulting in higher than average animal manure production united states census bureau 2020 california produces a representative percentage of u s agricultural value 13 california department of food and agriculture 2020 and food waste 15 cal recycle 2020 environmental protection agency 2020 however nutrient mass concentration depends greatly on the sub types of each organic waste stream e g dairy vs poultry manure almond vs corn residue therefore analysis in other regions should consider the relative mass of the different sub types of each organic waste stream one source of nutrients not considered for recovery in this analysis is liquid wastewater effluent during wastewater treatment only a portion of the nutrients are present in the mss 15 40 of nitrogen 28 94 of phosphorus and many treatment plants still discharge the liquid effluents and the nutrients present 4 85 of nitrogen 6 72 of phosphorus to the environment unless the liquid effluents are utilized for irrigating crops table s27 an alternative to recovering nutrients from this dilute wastewater would be to target urine which is a concentrated waste stream that contributes the majority of nutrients to wastewater and is not currently used in other markets table s28 notably if urine was diverted and managed separately the nutrient content in mss would be expected to decrease we only explored one option for treating organic waste ad many organic waste technologies are already established such as slow pyrolysis windrow composting in vessel composting and vermicomposting but these technologies likewise require careful analysis to verify system wide impacts zabaleta et al 2020 other technologies are under development such as hydrothermal liquefaction and other fermentation pathways that could produce a wider range of end products besides biogas lohri et al 2017 most of these technologies are likely to produce a liquid stream with high nutrient content therefore the analysis here still provides insight into the nutrient recovery potential the results from this research provide strong justification for continued development of nutrient recovery technologies and markets some technologies are well established from a technical standpoint like ammonia stripping but due to high cost and energy may not be feasible thus continued innovation is warranted to further develop and scale up technologies such as ion exchange and electrochemical stripping with lower cost energy and carbon footprints tarpeh et al 2018 kavvada et al 2017 other technologies like struvite precipitation are being implemented at full scale but need further refinement a useful finding from this research is that each organic waste stream has a unique mass concentration of nutrients total solids percentage and n p molar ratio which is relevant for informing further technology development the nutrient recovery percentage and the end products are technology and not context specific whereas the mass and location of each organic waste stream are context specific the anaerobic digestion performance is also dependent on the characteristics of the input organic waste stream therefore the quantitative analysis methodology presented here can be replicated in other contexts modified as additional technologies are developed and refined and be applied to characterize additional waste streams that are relevant in other contexts the recovered nutrients in this analysis are present as three different end products liquid fertilizer 38 of tn struvite 50 of tn 66 of tp and compost 12 of tn 34 of tp values are averages for all organic waste streams processed by the baseline scenario while compost is familiar and markets exist there is still much uncertainty about how to develop markets for waste derived liquid fertilizer and struvite de boer et al 2018 kok et al 2018 further efforts are needed to determine the environmental sustainability and life cycle costs for the presented digestate treatment systems as well as technologies reaching full scale additionally efforts are needed in california and elsewhere to coordinate the use of these nutrients in agricultural production ebmud 2017 nkoa 2014 improvements in fertilizer use efficiency such as better matching product assimilation rates to agricultural crops nutrient needs would reduce demand in california and therefore increase the potential contribution of nutrient recovery from organic wastes to offset total market demand because crops typically utilize less than 50 of the synthetic nitrogen fertilizer applied more than 50 of nitrogen enters the environment via groundwater surface water or air tomich et al 2015 improving fertilizer use efficiency would therefore also help close nutrient cycles by reducing the amount of nitrogen lost to groundwater and the air 4 conclusions anaerobic digestion is increasingly being used to treat a range of organic waste streams to produce energy however the nutrient rich digestate must also be managed in this study we quantified the mass of nutrients that can potentially be recovered from five key organic waste streams in california by integrating anaerobic digestion with nutrient recovery and compared this mass to statewide fertilizer demand in summary for the high market potential scenario in 2020 municipal sewage sludge was the largest potential contributor to nitrogen and phosphorus recovery by mass by 2050 other organic waste streams such as animal manure and agricultural crop residue increased in importance the distribution of nutrients in the three different end products was liquid fertilizer 38 of the total recovered mass of tn struvite 50 tn 66 tp and compost 12 tn 34 tp ad facilities integrated with nutrient recovery could offset in state synthetic fertilizer purchases by an estimated 11 of

16543,diversion of organic waste from landfills offers an opportunity to recover valuable nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus that are typically discarded although prior research has explored the potential for buildout of anaerobic digestion ad infrastructure to treat organic waste and generate energy a better understanding is needed of the nutrient recovery potential from the solid and liquid byproducts digestate resulting from ad of these waste streams we quantified the system wide mass of nutrients that can potentially be recovered in california by integrating current and potential future ad facilities with existing nutrient recovery technologies based on a profitable build out scenario for ad the potential for nitrogen and phosphorus recovery by mass was greatest from municipal sewage sludge the nutrient recovery total mass was determined for three different end products for the combined organic waste streams liquid fertilizer 38 of the total recovered nitrogen tn struvite 50 tn 66 total phosphorous tp and compost 12 tn 34 tp based on the profitable build out scenario of ad facilities in california the recovered nutrients would offset an estimated 11 of tn and 29 of tp of in state synthetic fertilizer demand whereas a scenario in which all technically recoverable biomass is collected and treated could offset 44 of tn and 97 of tp demand graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anaerobic digestion resource recovery nutrient management struvite precipitation ammonia stripping 1 introduction anaerobic digestion ad is widely used to treat a range of organic waste streams in california three recent senate bills are likely to spur additional investments in ad of organic waste by providing targets and guidance to reduce methane emissions from manure and landfills senate bill 1383 in 2016 increase renewable energy production senate bill 100 in 2018 and control burning of agricultural and forestry waste senate bill 1260 in 2018 for example to meet the 2025 goal of 75 organic waste diversion from landfills in senate bill 1383 calrecycle estimates that new infrastructure is needed to increase digester capacity from 1 1 million tons to 5 1 million tons per year of organic waste calrecycle 2020 meeting the 2025 goal with ad infrastructure would also increase biomethane production to approximately 400 million cubic meters calrecycle 2020 separate from efforts to divert municipal organic waste construction of dairy digesters has accelerated in california driven by large greenhouse gas offset credits for renewable natural gas awarded through the low carbon fuel standards for diverting manure from lagoons california air resources board 2018 additionally a previous study by members of our research team explored the total quantity of organic waste in california that could be treated in waste to energy systems and the resulting energy potential breunig et al 2017 the waste streams in this previous analysis were animal manure am agri food process residues af agricultural crop residue ac and organic municipal solid waste omsw an anticipated challenge from the expansion of ad as a method for treating organic waste is that it generates a liquid digestate with a high nutrient content lukehurst et al 2010 the nutrients in this digestate if directly discharged would be added to the existing 9 of wastewater nitrogen that is already discharged to land and another 9 that is discharged to inland surface water in california tomich et al 2015 disposal of digestate derived from organic waste to the environment could further exacerbate eutrophication which can lead to harmful algal blooms and have large economic repercussions to fisheries tourism property values and recreation perry and lubchenco 2017 water environment federation 2014 the negative consequences of nutrient pollution may be intensified by rising temperatures and a growing world population larsen et al 2016 regulatory frameworks are already being considered in california to further reduce nutrient loads from point sources like wastewater to water bodies like san francisco bay ebmud 2017 the challenge of managing the liquid digestate may also represent an opportunity if the nutrients can be recovered to offset the use of synthetic fertilizers which are manufactured through energy intensive processes and non renewable resources maurer et al 2003 the haber bosch process used to fix nitrogen from the atmosphere consumes large quantities of natural gas and accounts for 1 2 of total global energy demand philibert 2018 phosphorus a finite resource is almost exclusively mined from mineral deposits cordell et al 2009 one option for nutrient recovery is direct land application of the liquid digestates however when compared to mineral fertilizer disadvantages of direct land application include lower fertilizer value higher potential for ammonia loss higher transportation costs odors and additional undesirable constituents like metals and organic pollutants leverenz et al 2019 nkoa 2014 alternatively the nutrients in the digestate can be further concentrated to generate fertilizer products campos et al 2019 and offset the economic and environmental costs of purchased synthetic fertilizer khoshnevisan et al 2018 combined with the nutrients present in the solid digestate i e biosolids which can also be applied to land there is potential to develop highly efficient systems for nutrient cycling campos et al 2019 tonini et al 2013 while other studies have estimated global nutrient recovery potential from wastewater trimmer et al 2017 and highlighted the ability of individual nutrient management technologies to recover nitrogen and phosphorus from organic waste streams campos et al 2019 ma et al 2018 tonini et al 2013 to our knowledge no study to date has complemented existing organic waste diversion efforts via a rigorous organic waste inventory combined with the large scale e g state or country wide potential for nutrient recovery from the resulting digestate the promise for this overall approach is recognized in the united nations un sustainable development goals and the united states national academy of engineering nae grand challenges which both contain targets for sustainably recovering resources like nutrients and energy from waste streams perry and lubchenco 2017 rosa 2017 thus utilizing ad integrated with additional nutrient management technologies can address multiple un sustainable development goals and nae grand challenges related to food energy water poverty mitigation waste reduction and climate change the overall goal of the study presented here was to quantify the mass of nitrogen and phosphorus that can be recovered from organic waste streams by integrating nutrient recovery with ad to make this question more tractable to answer we focused specifically on nutrient recovery potential in california using scenarios for 2020 and 2050 specific objectives of the study were to 1 quantify the nutrient content and total mass of the key organic waste streams 2 determine the fate of nitrogen and phosphorus during ad solid liquid separation and nutrient recovery from the solid and liquid streams and 3 compare the quantity of recovered nutrients with the quantity of purchased synthetic fertilizer the results provide insights that are relevant for other regions and the methodology can be adapted to quantify nutrient recovery potential for other types or mixtures of organic wastes and to model different nutrient recovery technologies as more information is gained on their performance the state of california was chosen to explore the question of nutrient recovery and use because in addition to producing the greatest quantity of organic waste of any state tomich et al 2015 and making available a wealth of data it has existing inefficiencies in nutrient cycling and has implemented strong policies to increase the recovery of energy and other value added products from organic waste in a recent nitrogen mass balance for the state of california the mass of nitrogen imported as synthetic fertilizer 37 was similar to that lost to the atmosphere nox n2 and nh3 42 through fossil fuel combustion energy generation and emissions from animal manure and fertilizer tomich et al 2015 there is also significant leaching of nitrogen into groundwater 16 recovering nutrients from organic waste streams has the potential to improve nutrient cycling by reducing the use of synthetic fertilizer and decreasing losses to the atmosphere and groundwater bodirsky et al 2014 2 materials and methods the methodology to quantify the mass of nitrogen and phosphorus that can be recovered from organic waste streams treated with ad integrated with nutrient recovery is shown in fig 1 multiple organic streams can be used as digester influent the digester produces biogas and a nutrient rich liquid effluent which can be separated into liquids and solids for further treatment the produced quantity of liquid and solid fertilizer was compared with the quantity of synthetic fertilizer purchased for in state use the quantity of nutrients that can be recovered in california assuming biomass production rates forecasted for 2020 and 2050 was calculated for a baseline scenario scenario 1 based on our literature review we determined other common technology options and integrated them into additional scenarios alternate separation processes scenarios 2a e alternate liquid nutrient recovery processes scenarios 3a c and an alternate solids treatment scenario 4 the processes assumptions equations and calculations involved in each step are summarized in table 1 and detailed in the sub sections below 2 1 organic waste streams anaerobic digesters can be used to stabilize a wide range of organic waste streams such as am ac af omsw and municipal sewage sludge mss lukehurst et al 2010 these five organic waste streams were chosen as they represent the largest organic waste streams by mass available for nutrient recovery three projections were used to represent the potential availability of organic waste streams in 2020 and 2050 gross technical and market gross refers to the total mass of the organic waste stream including waste currently collected and not currently collected and the technical portion is the fraction of the gross mass that would be feasible to collect can be used as an input into ad and is not used in another market market refers to the in state biomass that could be profitably diverted from the organic waste stream based on current cost estimates and a range of electricity selling prices combined market and policy related revenues per the lawrence berkeley national laboratory lbnl organics recycling facility investment model scown et al 2019 smith et al 2021 low and high market scenarios are modeled based on biomethane prices mcf of 15 and 25 respectively in 2020 and 12 and 60 respectively in 2050 the low price values are intended to represent expected energy market prices while the high price values are intended to reflect prices that could be achieved through a mix of consumer renewable energy mark ups and monetary environmental subsidies it should be noted that these market scenarios are conservative as they only consider potential profit driven private sector investment in ad facilities rather than the aggressive infrastructure investments that will likely be required to meet state landfill diversion goals the mass of organic wastes m produced in each year in wet and bone dry mg were previously calculated for am ac af and omsw for the years 2020 and 2050 breunig et al 2017 the largest contributor to the am category was dairy manure the ac category included culls from 39 food crops and residue from 51 food crops including almonds hay grapes and rice the af category included residues from 17 categories such as almond shells almond hulls brewery waste walnut shells and rice hulls lastly the omsw category contained categories such as green waste and food waste mss is currently treated in california at several hundred wastewater treatment plants through processes such as ad aerobic digestion sludge lagoons chemical oxidation and lime stabilization crites and tchobanoglous 1998 the mss that is currently anaerobically digested at 130 california facilities was considered to represent both the technical and market biomass as the facilities are already built and operated breunig et al 2017 the gross biomass kg day of mss includes the remaining wwtps that do not anaerobically digest their sludge and therefore was calculated based on existing total flow at each of california s 497 wastewater treatment plants in 2012 table s1 epa 2012 the mass of nutrients n per wet mass of biomass was estimated from published values identified through a comprehensive review of literature for total nitrogen tn ammonium nitrogen nh4 n and total phosphorus tp in each organic waste stream table 1 contains an overview of the categories units outputs parameters and supplementary tables tables s1 s21 detailed calculations and literature values are found in the supplementary tables it was assumed that tp was predominantly po4 3 p due to sparse literature on phosphate concentrations in organic waste streams nutrient mass concentration table s22 varies widely for different sub categories of some waste streams e g meat waste vs fruit waste for af however ad facilities typically take in a wide range of these wastes and do not have information about the specific breakdown therefore average values were calculated for each waste stream as a whole 2 2 anaerobic digestion types ad is used to stabilize solids and produce biogas that can be used as an energy resource breunig et al 2017 during the digestion process organic nitrogen and phosphorus are typically converted into inorganic ammonium and phosphate respectively orner et al 2020 two types of ad used to process organic waste streams are dry ad and wet ad dry ad facilities as well as stand alone wet ad facilities i e not part of a municipal wastewater treatment plant are a growing sector particularly in california where facilities are being built to handle more diverse waste streams to aid in landfill diversion calrecycle 2020 goldstein 2018 satchwell et al 2018 dry ad or wet ad may be more viable for some organic waste streams over others see tables 2 s5 because digestates have different biological chemical and physical properties mss am slurries and high moisture af are often treated with wet ad wet ad can also co digest sewage sludge with waste organics from food processing facilities at wwtps to provide benefits such as increased methane production lee et al 2019 food only omsw e g cafeteria or grocery store waste can often go to wet ad while mixed or co mingled omsw including green waste paper products etc would typically go to dry ad higher solids am and ac are commonly treated with dry ad though liquid can be added during wet ad to treat some higher solids wastes published literature was reviewed to determine the percent recovery ad of tn nh4 n and tp during ad although nutrient recovery percentages during ad are likely dependent on context specific factors such as initial nutrient content solid content operation temperature and hydrolysis extent currently this level of context specific data is unavailable for all combinations of the context specific factors therefore more general percent nutrient recovery data was used without substantial evidence to suggest differences we assume that nutrient recovery percentages in wet ad holds true for dry ad even though tn and tp content is generally maintained during ad digestate from wet ad has a much higher water content than dry ad therefore the concentration of nutrients may be higher in dry ad than wet ad which will impact subsequent separation and nutrient recovery xu et al 2018 a review of literature indicated that after ad approximately 89 of tn and 95 of tp end up in the digestate effluent and the percentage of nh4 341 and po4 3 140 table s23 increases from the digester influent to the digester effluent due to the digestion of organic nitrogen and phosphorus orner et al 2020 2 3 separation processes the nutrient rich digestate that leaves the anaerobic digester can be separated into its liquid and solid components for further treatment and easier transport lukehurst et al 2010 sanscartier et al 2012 separation has the benefits of producing a liquid stream from which nutrients are efficiently recovered other benefits of separation may include improved matching of liquid and solid products to crop needs reduced storage and transportation volume and reduced stirring moller and muller 2012 types of physical separation processes include belt press sieve drum screw press sieve centrifuge decanter centrifuge and brushed screen the separator equipment can be classified as low performance e g screw press which are typically used for feedstocks with high solids content or high performance e g centrifuge rotary drum which are generally used for low solids feedstocks guilayn et al 2019 high solids digestates may have clogging issues in high performance separation processes hjorth et al 2010 the effluent of dry ad will likely require less separation of liquids and solids than wet ad due to its lower water content thereby reducing costs from energy use riya et al 2020 it is also possible to couple low performance separation e g screw press of the digestate followed by high performance separation e g sieve or centrifuge of the subsequent liquid fraction guilayn et al 2019 in california the most common type of separation process utilized is the screw press therefore the screw press was chosen as the separation process for each digestate in the baseline scenario guilayn et al 2019 decanter centrifuges are the most effective at separating phosphorus into the solid form however it has the highest costs for both construction and operation and is therefore typically only used for very large systems lukehurst et al 2010 nonmechanical methods such as polymer additives can improve separation hjorth et al 2010 a literature review was utilized to determine the percentage of nutrients allocated to liquids l and solids s the sum must add to 100 the effectiveness of separation processes varies widely when digestate is separated the percentage of tn in the liquid can range from 68 belt press to 86 sieve drum brushed screen likewise the percentage of tp in the liquid can range from 29 decanter centrifuge to 84 brushed screen table s24 the nutrient recovery percentage during alternative separation processes were calculated in scenarios 2a e 2 4 nutrient recovery processes for liquids once separation has occurred the liquid digestate rich in nh4 and po4 3 is available for further treatment and nutrient recovery brändli et al 2007 example liquid nutrient recovery technologies include struvite precipitation ammonia stripping and thermal distillation vaneeckhaute et al 2017 the precipitation of struvite mgnh4po4 6h2o has been commercialized at full scale for fertilizer production at industrial and municipal wastewater treatment plants ostara 2021 and struvite can also be recovered from am digestate orner et al 2020 the precipitation process often requires the addition of magnesium and a base to recover nh4 and po4 3 in the form of struvite fertilizer le corre et al 2009 ammonia stripping which involves transferring nh3 aq into a gaseous phase at high ph followed by absorption back into an acidic liquid phase to stabilize it as nh4 requires the addition of a base and an acid e g sulfuric acid or nitric acid and can be used to produce a liquid fertilizer e g ammonium sulfate or ammonium nitrate vaneeckhaute et al 2017 this technology has also been commercialized at full scale e g anaergia to recover up to 90 of nh4 anaergia 2020 thermal distillation utilizes heat to promote evaporation of nh3 aq followed by condensation and can be combined with an acid to produce a liquid fertilizer such as ammonium sulfate or ammonium phosphate tun et al 2016 thermal distillation has achieved 95 nh4 recovery from digestate at the pilot scale 7500 gal d and is currently being implemented at full scale leverenz et al 2021 2019 technologies such as ion exchange tarpeh et al 2018 and the vuna process which uses partial nitrification activated carbon filtration and distillation to capture nutrients and eliminate pathogens vuna 2020 are viable for recovering nutrients from urine but have not yet been widely tested on digestate and are therefore not considered further here liquid nutrient recovery processes such as struvite precipitation simoes et al 2018 ammonia stripping anaergia 2020 and thermal distillation leverenz et al 2021 recover phosphorus and nitrogen at different efficiencies table s25 a review of literature was used to determine the percent nutrient recovery of each liquid nutrient recovery process struvite precipitation is the most effective at recovering tp 75 while also recovering some tn 10 to remove additional tn ammonia stripping and thermal distillation can be used as a second treatment step liquid nutrients were allocated to a liquid nutrient recovery process for the baseline scenario based on which technology had the highest recovery percentage as reported in literature nitrogen thermal distillation and phosphorus struvite leverenz et al 2021 simoes et al 2018 nutrient recovery for alternative processes were calculated in scenarios 3a c 2 5 nutrient recovery processes for solids multiple processes exist for further treating the biosolids class b biosolids that have detectable levels of pathogens can be land applied with restrictions whereas class a biosolids that have undetectable levels of pathogens can be land applied without restriction us epa 1992 land applied biosolids would theoretically recover all nutrients composting the biosolids has the potential to further inactivate pathogens through sufficient time and temperature grewal et al 2006 and produce a soil amendment often through the addition of a bulking agent bustamante et al 2013 landfilling biosolids requires transport and landfill space while offering no recovery a literature review was utilized to determine the percent nutrient recovery of each solid treatment process sr table s21 tiquia and tam 2000 in the baseline scenario all solid digestate is assumed to be composted to meet class a designation which would allow unrestricted land application in agriculture in scenario 4 the nutrient recovery percentage is calculated assuming the digested solids do not receive further treatment 2 6 produced quantity and desired quantity of nutrients for fertilizer adding the mass of recovered nutrients from liquid treatment to the mass of recovered nutrients from solid treatment results in the produced quantity of recovered nutrients np that can be used as fertilizer the produced quantity was compared to the desired quantity of nutrients nd represented in this study as the mass of purchased synthetic fertilizer we assume that the produced quantity could be used as a 1 1 offset of synthetic fertilizer while this is likely reasonable for the concentrated fertilizers produced from the separated liquid digestate nutrients in compost may not be fully utilized in all locations as farmers may require more concentrated products or more consistent nutrient uptake depending on their crop the mass of synthetic fertilizer was calculated by multiplying the average mass of nutrients in purchased synthetic fertilizer breunig et al 2019 california department of food and agriculture 2016 tomich et al 2015 by a growth factor 1 8 assumed between 2015 and 2020 and 15 5 between 2020 and 2050 based on the projected percent increase in gross agricultural crops in california breunig et al 2017 2 7 sensitivity analysis a sensitivity analysis was conducted for each process technology by adding or subtracting one standard deviation from the mean nutrient recovery the sensitivity factor sf was calculated by dividing the percent change in output by the percent change in input a higher sf indicates a more sensitive process technology because there was insufficient information regarding the variability of nitrogen recovery by thermal distillation a standard deviation of 20 was assumed in accordance with prior practice kavvada et al 2017 3 results and discussion in the subsequent sections we explore in detail the model results starting with characterization of the different organic waste streams then following the nutrients through each step of treatment needed for fertilizer production 3 1 organic waste streams the produced daily biomass that was feasible to treat by ad in the 2020 high market model scenario for organic waste streams encompassed by mss am ac af and omsw was 9 4 gg 9400 mg which was only 11 of the daily gross biomass of 87 gg fig 2 omsw 44 was the largest contributor due to the high intake tonnages possible when the renewable electricity is valued above market in the low market scenario as defined by the lower value of the electricity produced by ad mss was the largest contributor of daily biomass at 55 2 5 out of 4 5 gg followed by af 25 and omsw 19 the large contribution from mss can be mainly attributed to the abundance of existing infrastructure to treat mss at municipal wastewater treatment facilities in 2050 the modeled daily gross biomass of organic waste was 99 gg the largest contributors in the high market scenario in 2050 were omsw 37 and af 24 although ac 13 and am 9 became larger contributors in this scenario the percent contributions of each organic waste stream varied widely in the gross technical and market scenarios due to the differences in feasibility and cost of collection transportation and treatment it was estimated to be technically feasible to collect and therefore send to ad processes about a third of the organic wastes due primarily to limitations in the feasibility of collecting agricultural on field residues lack of digesters at smaller wastewater treatment facilities and the difficulties of collecting post consumer waste streams that are reasonably uncontaminated breunig et al 2017 additionally not all organic waste is viable for anaerobic digestion e g cardboard and lumber table s5 the technical scenario only included organic wastes not included in another market organic wastes that were already re applied to land were excluded however to fully utilize the energy and nutrient recovery potential in these wastes ad facilities must be built in significant quantities which requires either a viable profitable business opportunity or significant public sector organization and investment these opportunities appear to be limited currently which results in the low market scenario tonnages shown in this work though as organics waste diversion policies increase in scope and enforcement as is ongoing in california the amount of waste sent to ad facilities will likely trend closer to the technically recoverable quantities for example the mass of omsw in the 2020 market high scenario is projected to increase from 4 1 to 6 3 gg d by 2050 even though the technical quantity only increases from 7 5 to 7 7 gg d in the same period due to more viable business opportunities driven by policies such as sb 1383 if the mass of all recovered organic waste transitioned from the high market quantity to the technical quantity the mass would quadruple 9 to 33 gg d in 2020 and more than double 17 to 38 gg d in 2050 the majority of organic waste and its embedded nutrients in the gross scenario in fig 2 that is currently not technically recoverable is often discharged to surface water or disposed of at landfills further discussed in section s1 discharging organic waste streams to the environment can contribute to eutrophication while disposing at landfills can increase greenhouse gas emissions cal recycle 2020 alternatively direct land application of organic waste while providing benefits of returning beneficial nutrients to crops has limitations such as uncertain nutrient quantities and nutrient transfer application restrictions for food ground crops and potential exceedances of water quality regulations conijn et al 2018 given the market biomass for each organic waste stream and their corresponding nutrient mass concentrations and total solids percentages table s22 the nutrient loadings mg day to anaerobic digesters in the 2020 high market scenario were 204 for tn fig 3 a 117 for nh4 n and 76 for tp fig 3b together omsw and mss made up 80 of feedstock for tn and 88 for tp mss was the largest contributor for tn 55 and tp 75 in 2050 the total nutrient loadings mg day almost doubled to 361 for tn fig 3c 195 for nh4 n and 122 for tp fig 3d whereas ac contributed a negligible percentage of tn and tp in 2020 in 2050 the contributions were estimated to be 12 of tn and 6 of tp although a larger mass of organic waste was available from omsw than the from the other waste streams in the high market scenario fig 2 more nutrients were available from mss fig 3 because mss was the highest strength waste g of tn nh4 n and tp per kg organic dry weight mss contained 46 g tn kg followed by am ac omsw and af 37 9 19 7 12 0 and 10 8 g tn kg respectively the significant nutrient fluxes from streams other than mss fig 3 signal an opportunity to provide infrastructure to recover nutrients from these alternate streams 3 2 nutrient recovery for the remainder of the analysis only the high market scenario is presented to calculate nutrient recovery potential because we believe it is the most representative future scenario in between the low market scenario and what is technically feasible a detailed summary of the input values and results for the entire high market analysis is provided in fig s1 the comparable calculations and results for the technical scenario are presented in fig s2 in fig 3 the mass of nutrients recovered from each organic waste stream through each treatment step anaerobic digestion table s23 solid liquid separation table s24 and nutrient recovery table s25 is presented under the high market scenario in 2020 treating all the organic waste streams with ad would produce a digestate that contains 182 mg day of tn and 72 mg day of tp fig 3a and b if these nutrient rich digestates become runoff much of the nutrients would likely reach surface waters contributing to widespread eutrophication to evaluate the potential for nutrient recovery from digestate the baseline treatment process was solid liquid separation by screw press followed by composting of the solids and struvite precipitation and thermal distillation for the liquid stream the result was 131 mg day of tn struvite plus distillate and 38 g day of tp struvite that can be recovered from the liquid digestate fig 3a and 3b the composting step for solids treatment reduced the nitrogen recovery 53 of tn compared to no treatment of solids table s25 which resulted in 19 mg day of tn and 21 mg day of tp in the recovered compost the combined produced quantity of nutrients for fertilizer was 150 mg day of tn and 59 mg day of tp in 2020 fig s3 the majority of the tn came from mss 60 and omsw 26 the majority of the tp came from mss 75 approximately 88 of the combined quantity of tn was derived from the liquid digestate in the form of solid struvite fertilizer and liquid distillate fig 3a the ammonium in the liquid distillate can be recovered with acids to produce liquid fertilizers such as ammonium sulfate and ammonium phosphate similarly approximately 64 of the combined quantity of tp is derived from the liquid digestate fig 3b as a result the compost recovered from separated solids has only 12 of the tn and 36 of the tp that was present in the original waste stream it is interesting to note that the five organic waste streams have varied n p molar ratios after the anaerobic digestion step table s22 while the n p molar ratios in mss 4 7 and am 5 5 are lower the n p molar ratio in ac 14 8 omsw 13 0 and af 24 4 are much higher the n p molar ratio may be expected to vary between dry ad digestate and wet ad digestate as dry ad can accept a wider variety of organic wastes than wet ad an n p molar ratio of near one is beneficial for struvite precipitation due to the stoichiometric ratio of 1 1 n p in the mineral when the n p molar ratio is higher an alternative or additional technology is needed to increase the recovery of nitrogen as demonstrated in this analysis by ammonia stripping or thermal distillation to put the quantities of nutrients that can potentially be recovered from ad in perspective we provide a comparison to purchases of synthetic fertilizer the amount of synthetic fertilizer bought in california in 2015 was 1320 mg per day of tn and 200 mg per day of tp the amount of tn and tp in purchased synthetic fertilizer is expected to rise to 1340 mg per day and 205 mg per day by 2020 respectively our overall model results indicate that the potential for production of fertilizer from organic wastes in california would offset 11 of tn and 29 of tp of synthetic fertilizer purchases in the high market scenario for ad in 2020 in a similar model for the year 2050 organic production of fertilizer would offset 17 of the desired 1550 mg of tn and 40 of the desired 237 mg of tp the offset would be greater if all technically feasible organic waste was treated by ad with nutrient recovery 44 of tn and 97 of tp in synthetic fertilizers fig s2 in the technical scenario in 2020 animal manure is the leading contributor of nitrogen 41 and phosphorus 54 fig s4 therefore an important opportunity exists to offset or even replace purchased synthetic fertilizer by implementing nitrogen and phosphorus recovery technologies to treat digestate derived from organic waste streams however the absence of strong market drivers such as greenhouse gas offset credits currently limits the potential for ad which inherently limits the potential for nutrient recovery via treatment of the digestate in addition to the baseline scenario we evaluated alternate technology options for solid liquid separation treatment of the liquid digestate and treatment of the solids the results are summarized in table 2 and compared to the baseline scenario already presented in which 79 of tn and 79 of tp can be recovered from the input organic waste streams scenario 1 separation process did not impact overall tn recovery but shifted the percent recovered between the products recovered from the liquid and the solid tp recovery varied depending on the process chosen scenarios 2a e as compared to the affordable and ubiquitous screw press use of a decanter centrifuge contributed to recovery of an additional 9 of tp due to its high speed centrifugation causing more phosphorus to end up in the solid form where it is more effectively recovered scenario 2d therefore this technology may be of interest to wet ad facilities in the future if phosphorus fertilizers become a valuable byproduct however while more phosphorus was technically recovered in the solid form through compost the phosphorus recovered through the liquid digestate is in a more consistent form that could provide greater value both economically and environmentally as it is more likely to be suitable for use as a drop in fertilizer replacement eliminating a secondary liquid treatment step that includes nitrogen recovery thermal distillation dropped the tn recovery percentage from 79 to 16 scenario 3a likewise eliminating struvite precipitation reduced the tp recovery percentage from 79 to 30 scenario 3b facilities nonetheless may choose to invest in only one of these processes depending on the relative cost and resource energy and material intensity of each and the fertilizer markets available to them lastly eliminating composting as a final treatment step for solids improved the tn recovery percentage from 79 to 88 but the recovered product may have restrictions for land application due to higher pathogen risk scenario 4 3 3 sensitivity analysis the output of a sensitivity analysis of process technologies on recovery of tn and tp is shown in table s26 note that the overall tn and tp recovery was the combined recovery from products derived from both the separated liquids and solids the tn recovery percentage was most sensitive to variability in nutrient recovery in the anaerobic digester sf 0 80 a drop from 89 tn recovery to 69 recovery during ad resulted in a decrease in overall tn recovery from 81 to 65 separation sf 0 36 nutrient recovery via thermal distillation sf 0 35 and composting sf 0 20 had moderate sensitivity the sensitivity of liquid nitrogen recovery via struvite precipitation sf 0 02 was low because nitrogen that was not recovered in struvite was recovered by thermal distillation in contrast liquid nutrient recovery via struvite precipitation sf 0 65 ad sf 0 56 composting sf 0 32 and separation via screw press sf 0 21 all moderately affected tp recovery given the low confidence in the variability of nitrogen recovery by thermal distillation and the sensitivity of the overall recovery to this process more effort should be devoted to developing and characterizing this process 3 4 implications of nutrient management and future research anaerobic digesters are increasingly being used to treat multiple organic waste streams and nutrient recovery can complement existing energy recovery at these facilities to offset synthetic fertilizer production and reduce eutrophication potential wastewater treatment plants like east bay municipal utility district ebmud in oakland ca are already augmenting their existing anaerobic digesters with food waste to increase biogas production other treatment plants such as madison metropolitan sewerage district s nine springs plant in madison wi produce struvite from the liquid stream of their anaerobic digesters integrating nutrient recovery from both the solid and liquid digestate streams at treatment plants in california could considerably offset synthetic fertilizer purchases given that synthetic fertilizer represents 37 of all nitrogen imports in ca and 11 of tn was offset in the 2020 high market scenario tomich et al 2015 likewise capturing nitrogen as fertilizer could reduce nitrogen losses to the environment for example n2 gas represents 13 of california nitrogen exports tomich et al 2015 and n2 emissions during mainstream nitrification denitrification could be reduced through sidestream nutrient recovery from mss via ad the key inputs and losses from the nitrogen cycle in california are similar to those in europe and asia although california has relatively higher amounts of nitrogen that enter groundwater tomich et al 2015 ad is already used extensively in california primarily to treat mss at wastewater treatment facilities and in some cases as dedicated facilities for energy production the total mass of nutrients that can be recovered at wwtp could be increased by supplementing mss with other waste streams such as omsw which had much larger nitrogen fluxes largely due to its higher gross mass and nitrogen mass concentration fig 2 table s22 many of the existing anaerobic digesters that treat mss have the capacity to treat additional organic waste beyond what is currently processed thus efforts to utilize this existing infrastructure can increase the ability to recover nutrients as well as energy from other organic waste streams breunig et al 2017 additional work is needed to compare and spatially optimize the mass of recovered nutrients from existing digesters in california with the demand for nutrients in agricultural production thereby effectively matching potential supply with existing demand that is currently met with synthetic fertilizers although we focused on nitrogen and phosphorus in this manuscript because they are the main constituents by mass in synthetic fertilizers and because their recovery could prevent eutrophication the fate of other minerals such as potassium and calcium also merit further study while fertilizer products produced via ammonia stripping or thermal distillation would not contain these minerals potassium can be found in k struvite and calcium often forms other precipitates with phosphorus the approach presented in this paper can be used to estimate the nutrient recovery potential from these five organic waste streams in other states and regions for example because 90 of california is sewered tomich et al 2015 compared to 76 nationally wastewater treatment population connected 2020 relatively more mss is available in california than in other states likewise california produces 21 of u s dairy commodities tomich et al 2015 while only having 12 of the u s population resulting in higher than average animal manure production united states census bureau 2020 california produces a representative percentage of u s agricultural value 13 california department of food and agriculture 2020 and food waste 15 cal recycle 2020 environmental protection agency 2020 however nutrient mass concentration depends greatly on the sub types of each organic waste stream e g dairy vs poultry manure almond vs corn residue therefore analysis in other regions should consider the relative mass of the different sub types of each organic waste stream one source of nutrients not considered for recovery in this analysis is liquid wastewater effluent during wastewater treatment only a portion of the nutrients are present in the mss 15 40 of nitrogen 28 94 of phosphorus and many treatment plants still discharge the liquid effluents and the nutrients present 4 85 of nitrogen 6 72 of phosphorus to the environment unless the liquid effluents are utilized for irrigating crops table s27 an alternative to recovering nutrients from this dilute wastewater would be to target urine which is a concentrated waste stream that contributes the majority of nutrients to wastewater and is not currently used in other markets table s28 notably if urine was diverted and managed separately the nutrient content in mss would be expected to decrease we only explored one option for treating organic waste ad many organic waste technologies are already established such as slow pyrolysis windrow composting in vessel composting and vermicomposting but these technologies likewise require careful analysis to verify system wide impacts zabaleta et al 2020 other technologies are under development such as hydrothermal liquefaction and other fermentation pathways that could produce a wider range of end products besides biogas lohri et al 2017 most of these technologies are likely to produce a liquid stream with high nutrient content therefore the analysis here still provides insight into the nutrient recovery potential the results from this research provide strong justification for continued development of nutrient recovery technologies and markets some technologies are well established from a technical standpoint like ammonia stripping but due to high cost and energy may not be feasible thus continued innovation is warranted to further develop and scale up technologies such as ion exchange and electrochemical stripping with lower cost energy and carbon footprints tarpeh et al 2018 kavvada et al 2017 other technologies like struvite precipitation are being implemented at full scale but need further refinement a useful finding from this research is that each organic waste stream has a unique mass concentration of nutrients total solids percentage and n p molar ratio which is relevant for informing further technology development the nutrient recovery percentage and the end products are technology and not context specific whereas the mass and location of each organic waste stream are context specific the anaerobic digestion performance is also dependent on the characteristics of the input organic waste stream therefore the quantitative analysis methodology presented here can be replicated in other contexts modified as additional technologies are developed and refined and be applied to characterize additional waste streams that are relevant in other contexts the recovered nutrients in this analysis are present as three different end products liquid fertilizer 38 of tn struvite 50 of tn 66 of tp and compost 12 of tn 34 of tp values are averages for all organic waste streams processed by the baseline scenario while compost is familiar and markets exist there is still much uncertainty about how to develop markets for waste derived liquid fertilizer and struvite de boer et al 2018 kok et al 2018 further efforts are needed to determine the environmental sustainability and life cycle costs for the presented digestate treatment systems as well as technologies reaching full scale additionally efforts are needed in california and elsewhere to coordinate the use of these nutrients in agricultural production ebmud 2017 nkoa 2014 improvements in fertilizer use efficiency such as better matching product assimilation rates to agricultural crops nutrient needs would reduce demand in california and therefore increase the potential contribution of nutrient recovery from organic wastes to offset total market demand because crops typically utilize less than 50 of the synthetic nitrogen fertilizer applied more than 50 of nitrogen enters the environment via groundwater surface water or air tomich et al 2015 improving fertilizer use efficiency would therefore also help close nutrient cycles by reducing the amount of nitrogen lost to groundwater and the air 4 conclusions anaerobic digestion is increasingly being used to treat a range of organic waste streams to produce energy however the nutrient rich digestate must also be managed in this study we quantified the mass of nutrients that can potentially be recovered from five key organic waste streams in california by integrating anaerobic digestion with nutrient recovery and compared this mass to statewide fertilizer demand in summary for the high market potential scenario in 2020 municipal sewage sludge was the largest potential contributor to nitrogen and phosphorus recovery by mass by 2050 other organic waste streams such as animal manure and agricultural crop residue increased in importance the distribution of nutrients in the three different end products was liquid fertilizer 38 of the total recovered mass of tn struvite 50 tn 66 tp and compost 12 tn 34 tp ad facilities integrated with nutrient recovery could offset in state synthetic fertilizer purchases by an estimated 11 of

16544,the application of partial nitritation and anammox to remove nitrogen from mainstream wastewater is of great interest because of the potential to reduce energy cost and carbon dosage however this process confronts a dilemma of relatively high effluent nitrogen concentration 10 mg n l owning to the unwanted prevalence of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob and the intrinsic nitrate production by anammox bacteria here a novel technology named the one stage pnam that integrates partial nitritation anammox and methane dependent nitrite nitrate reduction reactions was developed in a single membrane biofilm reactor mbfr with feeding of synthetic mainstream wastewater containing 50 mg nh4 n l at a hydraulic retention time of 12 h more than 95 nitrogen was removed in the established one stage pnam process at a practically useful rate of 0 1 kg n m3 d microbial community characterization and in situ batch tests revealed a sophisticated microbial structure consisting of ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob anammox bacteria nitrite nitrate dependent anaerobic methane oxidation n damo bacteria and archaea and a small fraction of nob and aerobic methanotrophs the role of methane in removing nitrate was confirmed by switching on off the methane supply which relaxed the requirement for nob suppression in addition the established system was relatively robust against temperature variations evidenced by a total nitrogen removal efficiency above 80 at temperature as low as 14 the results provide a promising alternative for efficient nitrogen removal from domestic wastewater using methane as the sole carbon source graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anammox anaerobic methane oxidation nitrite nitrate dependent anaerobic methane oxidation n damo mainstream one stage membrane biofilm reactor 1 introduction autotrophic nitrogen removal via partial nitritation reaction 1 nh4 1 5o2 no2 2h h2o and anammox reaction 2 nh4 1 32no2 1 02n2 0 26no3 2 03h2o has attracted increasing attention over the past decades owning to its abilities to reduce aeration consumption and to remove nitrogen without organic carbon jetten et al 1997 kartal et al 2010 mulder et al 1995 strous et al 1999 therefore the achievement of a stable partial nitritation and anammox pn a process renders an attractive potential to drive wastewater treatment process towards energy neutrality nevertheless the pn a process has been only applied in treating high strength wastewater e g anaerobic digestion liquor and landfill leachate 500 1500 mg n l until now lackner et al 2014 while the attempts in low strength wastewater e g domestic sewage 40 60 mg n l only succeeded within laboratory reactors de clippeleir et al 2013 lackner et al 2015 li et al 2016 lotti et al 2014a ma et al 2013 meng et al 2021 wang et al 2021 moreover nitrate was usually accumulated in effluent of pn a process at a concentration of 5 15 mg n l in these successful laboratory demonstrations this is because of either the unwanted activity of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob or the intrinsic nitrate production in anammox reaction regarding the attempts in large scale it is difficult to maintain stable pn a performance due to wastewater dynamics thus accumulating even more nitrate in effluent gustavsson et al 2020 trojanowicz et al 2016 recently new technologies have been developed to improve the anammox based technologies of which combining anammox and methane dependent nitrite nitrate reduction is an attractive alternative in relative to traditional organic carbon e g methanol and acetate methane is inexpensive and widely available as the major component in biogas generated from anaerobic digesters calderon et al 2021 lv et al 2019 indeed these new technologies were originally designed based on the discovery of an bacterial group reaction 3 3ch4 8no2 8h 3co2 4n2 10h2o and an archaeal group reaction 4 ch4 4no3 co2 4no2 2h2o capable of performing nitrite and nitrate dependent anaerobic methane oxidation n damo respectively ettwig et al 2010 haroon et al 2013 raghoebarsing et al 2006 in cooperation with anammox bacteria n damo microorganisms enable a more robust nitrogen removal performance against wastewater dynamics and a better effluent quality in terms of less residual nitrogen along with the growing understanding of these new microbial processes the technologies are also evolving in particular for the biomass aggregation types applied i e from suspended biomass bhattacharjee et al 2016 luesken et al 2011 van kessel et al 2018 zhu et al 2011 to biofilm and granule liu et al 2021 liu et al 2020b xie et al 2018 notably a two stage concept has been used for the most of methane based technologies bhattacharjee et al 2016 liu et al 2021 liu et al 2020b luesken et al 2011 zhu et al 2011 in which anammox and n damo microorganisms grow in an anaerobic reactor as the second stage relying on the ammonium and nitrite generated by the upstream partial nitritation as the first stage the reason for the separation of aerobic and anaerobic processes in two sequential reactors in these previous studies was to avoid oxygen inhibition to anaerobic microorganisms as reported the activities of n damo bacteria and n damo archaea could be inhibited at trace level of oxygen guerrero cruz et al 2018 luesken et al 2012 van kessel et al 2021 nevertheless compared to the two stage configuration it is well acknowledged that combining aerobic and anaerobic processes in one single reactor exhibits more advantages such as lower capital investment less n2o emission and mitigated nitrite inhibition risk vlaeminck et al 2012 according to a survey based study about 90 of full scale sidestream pn a systems were achieved in one stage configuration lackner et al 2014 very recently a novel one stage technology coupling partial nitritation anammox and methane dependent nitrite nitrate reduction i e pnam process has been successfully demonstrated in a membrane biofilm reactor mbfr treating sidestream wastewater 1000 mg nh4 n l liu et al 2019 under oxygen limiting conditions the system achieved about 98 nitrogen removal while suppressing the activities of other unwanted microorganisms such as nob and aerobic methanotrophs until now the novel pnam process has been only applied for sidestream wastewater while the demonstration in mainstream wastewater is not available despite the significances practical relevance and fundamental interests firstly there is an urgent need to develop a new technology to deal with the difficulties that mainstream pn a process encounters as aforementioned theoretically the addition of methane as an alternative carbon source in pnam process could relax the requirement for nob suppression and allow the system with more robustness moreover the application of pnam in mainstream wastewater is of more practical relevance because the mainstream wastewater accounts for more than 80 of total nitrogen tn loading of a wastewater treatment plant wwtp more importantly different from the sidestream wastewater the mainstream wastewater has lower temperature 10 25 c vs 35 c and nitrogen concentration 20 60 mg tn l 1 vs 500 1500 mg tn l 1 lotti et al 2014b which will fundamentally increase difficulties to achieve the pnam process this study aims to assess the feasibility of achieving high level nitrogen removal from low strength mainstream wastewater based on the novel one stage pnam process to this end a laboratory scale methane supplied mbfr fed with synthetic wastewater mimicking domestic sewage was set up and operated for over 430 days in total the reactor was initially operated under anaerobic condition to develop anaerobic biofilms coupling anammox and n damo reactions oxygen was then supplied at a controlled rate aiming to cultivate aob at biofilm surface thus achieving pn anammox and n damo reactions in a single biofilm eventually 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing was conducted to investigate microbial community structure in particular to verify the presence of aob anammox bacteria n damo bacteria and n damo archaea in the biofilm a series of in situ batch tests were performed to confirm their respective contribution to the high level nitrogen removal achieved furthermore the role of methane and the response of established system against temperature variation 14 24 in mainstream wastewater were examined the outcomes of this study are potentially beneficial for the process upgradation of wwtps 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor configuration and setup as delineated in fig 1 an mbfr with a total volume of 310 ml was set up the column reactor contained a bunch of submerged hollow fiber membrane for methane delivery and biofilm development the overflow bottle was used for gas and liquid sampling as well as ph oakton australia and do hach hq40d usa monitoring specifically the hollow fiber membrane module comprising 260 non porous polypropylene hollow fibers teijin fibers ltd japan took up a volume of 1 4 ml for fiber materials and 0 4 ml for fiber lumen the outer diameter of the hollow fiber bundle was 200 μm giving an area volume ratio of 158 m2 m3 while one side of hollow fiber membrane was connected to a compressed gas cylinder 95 ch4 and 5 co2 coregas australia through a gas gage ross brown australia the other side was sealed to avoid methane escaping the lumen pressure was maintained at 200 kpa constantly in addition an air stone was placed in the overflow bottle which was connected to a vacuum pump via an air flow meter to produce fine bubbles at controlled flowrates from day 161 synthetic feeding mimicking the mainstream domestic sewage was prepared and stored in a 2 l feed tank which was transferred into the reactor by a peristaltic pump masterflex l s usa to limit the uncontrolled oxygen penetration and maintain the normal gas pressure inside the feed tank was connected to a 2 l gas bag tedlar australia filled with n2 gas the influent nitrogen compositions in different phases are summarized in table 1 while trace elements were also supplemented in the feeding according to ettwig et al 2009 to mix the liquid the bulk liquid was recirculated by a peristaltic pump bt300 2 j longer china the ph of bulk liquid was maintained at 7 0 0 5 by dosing 1 m hcl or 2 m naoh manually the temperature was controlled at 22 1 in a temperature controlled lab the water seal bottle was used to collect the washed out biomass as well as to prevent air back diffusion into the reactor 2 2 operational strategies and conditions the experiment consisted of three major phases including two stage phase inoculation phase and one stage phase table 1 initially the reactor was inoculated with 100 ml suspended culture volatile suspended solid vss 3 g l from a lab scale parent reactor consisting of anammox and n damo microorganisms haroon et al 2013 and operated under strictly anaerobic condition in order to demonstrate the two stage nitrogen removal concept the two stage phase day 1 150 included three sub phases in which the ratio of influent nitrite to ammonium changed from 1 06 to 1 51 to test the robustness of the system against influent dynamics the hydraulic retention time hrt was set to be 12 h afterwards the reactor was inoculated with enriched aob biomass from a laboratory sequential bioreactor treating high strength wastewater 800 1000 mg n l lim et al 2021 and operated in batch mode for 10 days day 151 160 during this period only stock solutions of ammonium chloride 46 g nh4 n l 1 and sodium nitrite 32 g no2 n l 1 were manually added to avoid biomass wash out the concentrations of ammonium and nitrite were maintained in the range of 0 240 mg n l and 0 30 mg n l respectively during the inoculation phase in addition the wash out biomass 2 ml in total which settled at the bottom of the settling bottle was collected and manually returned to the reactor on daily basis for re attachment from day 161 the reactor was continuously fed with synthetic mainstream wastewater at hrt of 12 h ammonium was the only nitrogen compound in influent based on the reactor performance the air supply rate was set to be 0 1 l d from day 161 to 198 which was changed to 0 2 l d on day 199 and to 0 15 l d on day 226 when the reactor reached a steady state a series of in situ batch tests were designed and carried out to determine the microbial activities role of methane and impact of temperature variations as elaborated in the following sections effluent samples 2 ml were taken two or three times per week to determine the concentrations of nitrogen compounds ammonium nitrite and nitrate biofilm samples were taken on day 130 180 250 300 and 325 for microbial community analysis the chemical analysis and microbial community characterization methods i e 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing are based on previous studies chen et al 2020 wang et al 2020 as described in details in supplementary information si 2 3 in situ batch tests to determine the microbial activities in order to determine the active bio reactions in the developed biofilm seven in situ batch tests were conducted at the end of the one stage phase day 326 355 table 2 before each batch test methane supply from the hollow fiber was stopped for batch a b c and d the reactor was flushed with methane gas 95 ch4 5 co2 for 15 min at the beginning of each test giving an initial dissolved methane concentration about 18 mg ch4 l among all the condition of batch a was the same to the long term operation with ammonium oxygen and methane available which was conducted in triplicate to confirm the reproducibility of the short term tests specifically the reactor was spiked with ammonium at 25 mg n l and do was controlled at 0 1 0 05 mg l batch b and c were designed to examine the activities of n damo bacteria and n damo archaea under anaerobic condition with an initial spiking of nitrite and nitrate at 25 mg n l respectively batch d was designed to study the activity of aerobic methanotrophs in which oxygen and methane were available in batch e f and g the dissolved methane was firstly stripped by flushing the reactor with nitrogen gas for 15 min batch e was designed to investigate the one stage pn a process without influence of methane with the initial ammonium concentration set to be 25 mg n l and the do concentration controlled at 0 1 0 05 mg l similarly batch f was used to investigate the nob activity with the initial nitrite adjusted to 25 mg n l and do controlled at 0 1 0 05 mg l batch g was used to test the anammox activity under anaerobic condition in which the initial ammonium and nitrite concentrations were both adjusted to 25 mg n l in each test liquid samples were taken at 0 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 h to determine the concentrations of nitrogen species and dissolved methane 2 4 in situ batch tests to confirm the role of methane to further verify the role of methane and to examine the system robustness against the short term methane depletion the mbfr was operated without day 356 to 375 and with day 376 to 415 methane supply in sequence for two months in total in addition to the methane supply other operational parameters were remaining unchanged in this two month examination effluent samples 2 ml were taken two or three times per week to determine the concentrations of ammonium nitrite and nitrate moreover to study the variation of activities of n damo bacteria and n damo archaea without and with methane supply short term batch tests similar to batch b and c in table 2 were performed weekly briefly the activities of n damo bacteria and n damo archaea were calculated in 6 h tests with addition of methane and nitrite and methane and nitrate respectively 2 5 in situ batch tests to investigate system response against temperature variations considering the temperature variation of mainstream wastewater the response of the established system to the temperature change was investigated day 416 430 four runs at different temperature levels 24 22 18 and 14 were carried out consecutively with each lasting for 3 days corresponding to 6 hrt the temperature was regulated and controlled by an immersion cooler rc1 ratek australia together with a precision immersion heater circulator th8000 ratek australia in all these tests the influent tn concentration was kept constant at 50 mg n l and the oxygen supply was maintained at 0 15 l d liquid samples were taken every 12 h to determine the concentrations of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n 3 results and discussion 3 1 two stage and one stage nitrogen removal from mainstream wastewater the mbfr was established and operated for 430 days in total mainly including the two stage phase day 1 150 and the one stage phase day 161 325 fig 2 in two stage phase the mbfr operated under anaerobic conditions was designed to treat partially nitrified mainstream wastewater from the first stage i e partial nitritation fig 2a at the beginning of two stage phase day 1 55 the influent nitrite to ammonium ratio was set to be 1 06 fig 2b a decreasing trend was observed for the concentrations of nitrite and nitrate in effluent which reached 0 mg n l and 1 1 mg n l at the end of this period however the effluent ammonium concentration fluctuated at a relatively higher level with an average value of 4 7 mg n l this phenomenon indicated the limitation of nitrite which restricted the anammox activity to further remove ammonium therefore from day 56 the influent nitrite to ammonium ratio was increased to 1 29 with the total nitrogen unchanged to improve the ammonium removal as expected the effluent ammonium declined to about 2 4 mg n l following such change while the nitrite was stably at 0 mg n l this observation confirmed that the limitation of nitrite was responsible for the residual ammonium in effluent and the system also had overcapacity to cope with the nitrite increase in influent notably the nitrate concentration in effluent increased firstly due to the increased production by anammox reaction and then decreased because of the enhanced activity of n damo archaea to further push the ammonium removal and examine the system robustness against influent variations the influent nitrite to ammonium ratio was increased to 1 51 on day 105 upon this change the ammonium in effluent declined to about 0 7 mg n l while the nitrite was maintained to be undetectable the effluent nitrate at steady state was 1 7 mg n l at average giving rise to a tn removal efficiency above 95 fig 2b on day 151 the mbfr was inoculated with enriched aob and operated in batch mode for 10 days for biofilm attachment data not shown afterwards the mbfr was switched to the one stage phase which was fed with synthetic mainstream wastewater only 51 5 mg nh4 n l continuously at an hrt of 12 h for about 165 days with different air flowrates fig 2c in order to avoid the oxygen inhibition to anaerobic microorganisms the air flowrate was controlled to be only 0 1 l d from day 161 to day 198 fig 2d leading to an average do level of 0 07 mg l due to the insufficient oxygen supply the residual ammonium in effluent was above 8 mg n l while the nitrite and nitrate concentrations were only 0 1 mg n l and 0 3 mg n l on average respectively this result suggested that the aerobic ammonia oxidation was limited therefore from day 199 the oxygen flowrate was elevated to 0 2 l d following such change the ammonium in effluent immediately decreased to below 2 mg n l nevertheless the do level was unstable and varied in a broad range of up to 0 5 mg l meanwhile the nitrate concentration in effluent dramatically increased to up to 8 6 mg n l indicating the inhibited n damo archaea activity at such high do level to achieve stable nitrogen removal performance the air flowrate was declined to 0 15 l d from day 226 following this change the nitrate concentration in effluent gradually dropped back to below 5 0 mg n l in a week and to below 1 0 mg n l after about 40 days while the ammonium concentration in effluent increased slightly and maintained at an average value of 2 5 mg n l during this period the do concentration was well controlled below 0 1 mg l while the tn removal efficiency reached up to 95 4 fig 2d corresponding to the hrt of 12 h the tn removal rate was about 0 1 kg n m3 d this result indicated the success of achieving one stage nitrogen removal in the experiment 3 2 microbial community characterization the microbial community structure was elucidated by 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing during the entire experiment fig 3 at genus level n damo bacteria n damo archaea and anammox bacteria were detected in all biofilm samples taken during two stage day 130 and one stage phases day 180 250 300 and 325 fig 3a while candidatus methylomirabilis n damo bacteria dominated all biofilms with relative abundance of 4 8 30 7 candidatus methanoperedens n damo archaea and candidatus brocadia anammox bacteria were observed with less relative abundances of 1 0 7 5 and 0 5 3 5 respectively on the other hand aerobic microorganisms including aob nob and aerobic methanotrophs were detected in biofilms taken during one stage period specifically nitrosomonas aob which was undetectable in two stage phase day 130 was determined to be 0 1 0 4 in one stage period day 180 250 300 and 325 moreover the total relative abundance of aerobic methanotrophs such as methylocystis methylophilus methylocaldum and methylococcus were calculated to be 0 3 1 8 nitrospira which was initially undetectable in one stage phase day 180 increased to 0 1 0 2 during the experiment variations in relative abundances of anaerobic and aerobic microbial groups with known functions during one stage phase were further analyzed and presented in fig 3b firstly anaerobic microorganisms considerably dominated over aerobic populations while the relative abundances of anammox bacteria n damo bacteria and n damo archaea in all samples were above 1 the aerobic groups including aob nob and aerobic methanotrophs only accounted for less than 1 of the total microbial community this result indicated that the majority of biofilm was under anaerobic condition likely because the limited oxygen 0 1 mg l detected on the biofilm surface could not penetrate into the inside of biofilm on the other hand the results also verified that anaerobic microbes including anammox bacteria n damo bacteria and n damo archaea could be well sustained under oxygen limiting conditions 0 1 mg l while aob were successfully enriched after supplying oxygen into the reactor nob were also developing in the biofilms however it should be noted that the nitrate concentration in effluent remained at a low level 1 mg n l in most of the time fig 2c the functions of other microbial populations remain to be investigated which likely live on the lysate and perhaps more importantly carbon compounds excreted by other organisms lawson et al 2017 a recent study reported that n damo archaea could produce acetate from methane via intracellular storage compounds e g polyhydroxyalkanoate and glycogen cai et al 2019 which also supported the growth of other partners given the predominance of anaerobic condition in the biofilm nitrate and nitrite were likely the main electron acceptors for these organisms for example denitratisoma which might be capable of heterotrophic denitrification was detected with relative abundance of 0 8 4 4 such a potential denitrifier was previously detected in other n damo bai et al 2019 wu et al 2019 and anammox based systems cao et al 2016 wang et al 2017a similarly candidatus roizmanbacteria with a high relative abundance 3 7 15 6 was observed in other n damo cultures as well lim et al 2021 liu et al 2021 which belongs to a superphylum candidate parcubacteria without cultured representatives león zayas et al 2017 several microorganisms affiliated to anaerolineaceae family were also observed as flanking partners in n damo hu et al 2015 lu et al 2016 and anammox cultures kindaichi et al 2012 lawson et al 2017 which were speculated to play a role in biomass aggregation gao et al 2011 and live on organic carbon from cell lysis for growth cao et al 2016 kindaichi et al 2012 3 3 determination of species specific microbial activities by in situ batch tests at the steady state of operation in situ batch tests were performed under different conditions aiming to decouple the combined reactions and to decipher the interactions among different microbial populations fig 4 and table s1 firstly methane was supplied in batch a to batch d to illustrate the respective role of methane oxidizers in the system notably the condition of batch a with ammonium and methane supplied at do of 0 1 mg l was similar to that applied during long term operation therefore batch a was treated as the positive control including all potential functional reactions in the 6 h test ammonium and methane simultaneously decreased without accumulation of nitrite or nitrate fig 4a this result was in line with the observation during long term operation that ammonium was removed with very limited nitrite or nitrate accumulated 1 mg n l fig 2c in batch b and c methane was supplied with nitrite or nitrate respectively to determine the role of methane dependent nitrite i e n damo bacteria and nitrate i e n damo archaea removal based on the observation of simultaneous consumption of methane and nitrite nitrate fig 4b and c the rate of n damo bacteria was determined to be 40 9 and 30 7 mg n l d in batch b and c respectively while the rate of n damo archaea was calculated to be 37 2 mg n l d in batch c table 3 moreover to identify the contribution of aerobic methanotrophs methane was supplied in batch d with oxygen as the only electron acceptor fig 4d as expected the rate of aerobic methane oxidation was only 2 4 mg ch4 l d which was one order of magnitude lower than the anaerobic methane oxidation rate 23 6 mg ch4 l d measured in batch c indicating that aerobic methanotrophs played a minor role for the methane consumption in the system additionally the roles of other functional populations were also investigated in batch e with ammonium and oxygen a similar ammonium consumption rate 90 8 mg n l d was observed in comparison to batch a 89 3 mg n l d whereas nitrate gradually accumulated to 3 2 mg n l in 6 h fig 4e while the activity of nob in batch a 1 9 mg n l d and e 2 9 mg n l d was both determined to be low the difference in nitrate concentration again confirmed the role of methane in nitrate removal moreover the addition of methane showed a weak impact on ammonium consumption rate likely because of the counter diffusion of ammonium i e from biofilm surface to substratum and methane i e from biofilm substratum to surface under conditions with sufficient nitrite and without other competitors in batch f the nitrite conversion to nitrate was observed fig 4f and the rate of nob was calculated to be 14 3 mg n l d according to the increase of nitrate concentration in batch g with unlimited nitrite and ammonium under anaerobic condition fig 4g the maximal activity of anammox bacteria was determined to be 73 4 mg no2 n l d table 3 based on the results obtained from in situ batch tests the species specific nitrogen methane conversion rates of each microbial group were summarized in table 3 firstly mass balance calculation was performed to confirm the active reactions for example the ratio of nitrite reduction to methane oxidation in batch b and the ratio of nitrate reduction to methane oxidation in batch c were determined to be 2 48 and 1 55 respectively which were slightly higher than the theoretical values of 2 33 and 1 40 based on the reactions of n damo bacteria and n damo archaea reactions 3 and 4 these observations indicated the active activities of n damo bacteria and n damo archaea as well as the minor contribution by other nitrogen scavengers e g heterotrophic denitrifiers moreover comparisons among different batch tests could also provide more in depth understanding about the microbial interaction for instance the comparison of the activity of nob in batch a e and f leads to a conclusion that the involvement of nitrite competitors i e anammox bacteria and n damo bacteria could well suppress the activity of nob in the biofilm similarly the availability of nitrite was also found to be a limiting factor for the activity of n damo bacteria and anammox bacteria if comparing batch b to batch a c and batch g to batch a e these results suggested that the contribution of n damo bacteria and anammox bacteria to nitrogen removal during the normal long term operation of the mbfr was limited by the low level nitrite 3 4 determination of species specific microbial activities during long term operation the species specific nitrogen conversion rates during long term operation were calculated as described in si and presented in fig 5 during the two stage phase following the increase of nitrite concentration in influent the nitrite removal rate by anammox bacteria maintained relatively stable at about 50 mg n l d while the rate by n damo bacteria gradually increased from 0 to 15 mg n l d fig 5a this phenomenon suggested that the system robustness against influent nitrite dynamics was indeed supported by n damo bacteria when the influent nitrite to ammonium ratio increased to above the level that anammox bacteria could deal with the residual nitrite would be removed by n damo bacteria thus maintaining a low level of nitrite in effluent constantly at the final stage of two stage phase the nitrite removal rate by anammox bacteria was about 3 times higher than that by n damo bacteria indicating anammox bacteria made a major contribution to nitrogen removal notwithstanding the role of n damo bacteria in alleviating the impact of influent nitrite to ammonium ratio dynamics at the beginning of one stage phase the activities of all microorganisms slightly increased with a limited air supply fig 5b notably the nitrite removal rate by n damo bacteria 15 mg n l d and the nitrate removal rate by n damo archaea 10 mg n l d kept at the similar levels in comparison to the end of two stage phase this consistency indicated that the activities of n damo microorganisms were not affected by the supply of limited oxygen however when the air supply was doubled from day 199 a dramatic decrease in n damo archaeal activity to almost 0 was observed suggesting that n damo archaea were completely inhibited during the period with high oxygen flux as the experiment continued the activity of n damo archaea recovered to the previous level in about 10 days when the air flux was decreased back to 0 15 l d at the steady state of one stage phase anammox bacteria was responsible for about 75 of the nitrite removed while n damo bacteria contributed to the rest moreover the nitrate removal rate by n damo archaea reached slightly above 10 mg n l d which could cope with the total nitrate generated from anammox bacteria and nob thus maintaining a satisfactory effluent quality 3 5 verification of the role of methane to further verify the role of methane in the proposed one stage pnam system the methane supply was stopped from day 356 for 20 days following the methane depletion the nitrate in effluent gradually accumulated to up to 5 3 mg n l fig 6 a meanwhile the ammonium in effluent maintained at 3 6 1 0 mg n l while the nitrite was always below the detection limit 0 02 mg n l fig 6c during this period the average nitrate production rate to ammonium removal rate was 0 10 which was close to the theoretical value i e 0 11 such phenomenon indicated that the nitrate accumulation was because of anammox reaction rather than nob growth corresponding to this change the tn removal efficiency was determined to be 83 9 on average fig 6d from day 376 methane was resupplied from the hollow fiber leading to an immediate decrease in the nitrate concentration in effluent to 1 0 mg n l on average meanwhile the nitrite in effluent remained to be negligible and the ammonium fluctuated around 4 mg n l jointly resulting in a tn removal efficiency above 90 this observation suggested that the system was robust against the short term methane depletion which could be recovered quickly once the methane was resupplied such robustness was also reflected by the maximal activities of n damo archaea and n damo bacteria measured weekly fig 6b specifically there was no significant change for the maximal activities of n damo archaea and n damo archaea during the experiment indicating that these anaerobic methane scavengers could stay alive under starvation for a certain period collectively the system was robust against short term methane depletion and the addition of methane was further confirmed to be responsible for nitrate removing warranting a satisfactory effluent quality 3 6 response to temperature variations the temperature of domestic mainstream wastewater usually changes seasonally therefore the response of the established system against temperature variations was studied fig 7 four temperature levels were selected including 26 22 18 and 14 notably the tn removal efficiency was maintained to be above 80 even at temperature as low as 14 highlighting the applicability of the process to mainstream wastewater in practice specifically at temperature of 26 and 22 the effluent contained 1 0 mg no3 n l and 4 0 mg nh4 n l on average with no nitrite detected fig 7a giving rise to an average tn removal efficiency above 90 fig 7b when the temperature was declined to 18 the ammonium p 0 01 and nitrate p 0 05 concentrations in effluent significantly increased leading to a decrease in tn removal efficiency to 85 7 interestingly the nitrite concentration in effluent remained to be 0 mg n l at 18 indicating that the nitrite consumption was more robust than ammonium and nitrate this could be associated with the fact that there were two nitrite scavengers in the system i e anammox bacteria and n damo bacteria which could provide the system with a certain level of overcapacity furthermore when the temperature was decreased to 14 nitrite started to be accumulated in effluent at an average level of 0 5 mg n l leading to a significant deterioration of the overall nitrogen removal performance p 0 01 these results showed that the removal of different nitrogenous compounds had different short term responses against the decrease in temperature although a previous study has showed the long term stability of nitrogen removal performance in a two stage anammox n damo process liu et al 2020a long term effects of low temperature on the present reactor should be further evaluated before applying the one stage pnam process in practice 3 7 methane as alternative carbon source driving high level nitrogen removal in mainstream wastewater in this study methane was used as the sole carbon source supporting a high level nitrogen removal from synthetic mainstream wastewater based on one stage pnam process fed with ammonium as the only nitrogen source a practically useful tn removal rate of 0 1 kg n m3 d was achieved with an average tn removal efficiency of 95 in the established biofilms functional microorganisms including aob anammox bacteria n damo bacteria and n damo archaea were successfully coupled together along with a small fraction of nob and aerobic methanotrophs while the pnam process was demonstrated in treating sidestream wastewater 1000 mg nh4 n l in a previous study liu et al 2019 this is the first study to demonstrate the feasibility of achieving high level nitrogen removal from mainstream wastewater 51 5 mg nh4 n l using such the process considering the fact that the mainstream wastewater contains more than 80 of tn loading in wwtps the demonstration in mainstream wastewater is of more relevance and significance for practical application in recent years the one stage pn a process has been widely studied to treat mainstream wastewater de clippeleir et al 2013 gilbert et al 2014 han et al 2016 hendrickx et al 2012 li et al 2016 lotti et al 2014b meng et al 2021 wang et al 2021 however the nitrate accumulation in pn a process either from the intrinsic production by anammox bacteria reaction 2 or from the uncontrollable activity of nob is critical for achieving satisfactory effluent quality to improve the tn removal efficiency external organic carbon needs to be further supplemented for removing nitrate however the addition of traditional organic carbon such as acetate and methanol will not only increase the operational cost of wastewater treatment but also lead to a problem for maintaining anammox activity on the one hand the activity of anammox bacteria was shown to be inhibited by some organic carbons e g methanol and alcohols güven et al 2005 isaka et al 2008 jensen et al 2007 on the other hand the availability of traditional organic carbon could result in the prevalence of heterotrophic denitrifiers which grow much faster and likely dominate over anammox bacteria chamchoi et al 2008 chen et al 2009 liu et al 2017 compared to traditional organic carbon methane is cheaper and in situ available in wwtps as it forms a large proportion of biogas generated from anaerobic digesters meanwhile methane shows no inhibitory effect to anammox bacteria and the combination of anammox bacteria and n damo microorganisms has been shown to be feasible and stable shi et al 2013 entailed with these advantages the proposed pnam process aims to use methane as an alternative caron source to achieve a high level effluent quality by using methane as electron donor the removal of nitrate by n damo archaea contributed to the much reduced effluent tn level specifically n damo archaea removed about 70 of the nitrate produced in the present study leading to an effluent nitrate concentration below 1 mg n l fig 2c especially the tn concentration in effluent was below 5 mg n l on average which are acceptable in most regions directive 1991 epa 2002 voudouris and voutsa 2012 the applied do concentration appears critical for the success of pnam process while low oxygen supply limited the ammonia oxidation high oxygen supply showed an inhibitory effect on the nitrogen removal by anaerobic microorganisms specifically with a low air flow rate of 0 1 l d the do level in reactor was well controlled to below 0 1 mg l evidenced by the extremely low nitrite and nitrate concentrations in effluent the anammox and n damo activities were not affected by the low oxygen concentration during this period fig 2c while n damo archaea and n damo bacteria in suspended form could be easily inhibited by even trace level of oxygen guerrero cruz et al 2018 luesken et al 2012 it appears that n damo microorganisms residing at the inner layer of biofilm were not affected by the limiting oxygen in bulk liquid in contrast doubling the air supply resulted in do increase to up to 0 5 mg l as well as an immediate ammonium decrease and nitrate accumulation jointly suggesting the inhibition to anammox and n damo microorganisms and the promotion for nob these results collectively showed that the oxygen supply should be controlled precisely in order to maintain sufficient aerobic ammonia oxidation while not to pose negative effect to anaerobic processes nonetheless a good sign should be noted is that when the do was decreased back to below 0 1 mg l the deteriorated nitrogen removal performance could be recovered in a relatively short time i e 1 2 weeks this showed a certain robustness of the system against do variations which is beneficial for practical application 3 8 double insurance to suppress nob growth and activity suppression of nob is a very critical step for short cut nitrogen removal which is a known challenge for mainstream wastewater previous studies have applied various strategies to achieve this aim such as low do control guo et al 2009 regmi et al 2014 sliekers et al 2005 and energy intensive or biocidal agents applied treatments wang et al 2017b zheng et al 2019 however the efficacy of these strategies was observed to decline after a long term operation because of the nob adaptation duan et al 2018 li et al 2020 zheng et al 2020 until now the nob suppression in mainstream wastewater treatment is still an unsolved problem in the present system nob were detected in the biofilms fig 3 and the activity was determined to be not negligible under optimal condition with sufficient nitrite and no competitors batch f in table 3 however intriguingly the nitrate concentration in the final effluent was kept below 1 mg n l at steady state during long term operation this disagreement indicated that the nob activity was suppressed during long term operation despite their existence in the biofilm on the one hand the nob activity was suppressed by the low oxygen applied as aforementioned the oxygen supply is vital for the success of pnam process the do concentration was maintained below 0 1 mg l in bulk liquid and was even lower inside biofilm which surely limited the activities of nob peng et al 2012 regmi et al 2014 sliekers et al 2005 on the other hand in the presence of ammonium and methane i e in the presence of competition for nitrite by anammox and n damo bacteria the activity of nob could be also suppressed evidenced by the dramatic decrease by about one order of magnitude in nob activity from batch f to batch a and e these multiple factors i e low oxygen and competition against other nitrite scavengers successfully suppressed the major activity of nob yet not completely indeed the activity of nob during long term operation should be similar to that measured in batch a under similar condition 1 9 mg n l d theoretically this slow nob activity together with the nitrate generated from anammox reaction could result in nitrate accumulation in effluent above 5 mg n l if without methane addition as shown in the present study fig 6 to further remove the residual nitrate and to obtain an effluent quality meeting the regulation standard the addition of methane in the present study is the second insurance with the supply of methane n damo archaea can convert nitrate back to nitrite further cross feeding anammox bacteria and n damo bacteria indeed the methane supply also relaxes the requirement for nob suppression notwithstanding the benefits of energy saving with nob suppression this relative flexibility of pnam process is much expected for application in practice moreover the applied 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing was unable to distinguish whether the detected nitrospira are canonical nob or the newly discovered complete ammonia oxidizers comammox daims et al 2015 van kessel et al 2015 further experiment using metagenomics or quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr would be useful to address this question 3 9 ecological model connecting nitrogen and methane cycles the established biofilm is an ideal ecological model to study the interactions of microbial populations in nitrogen and methane cycles microbial analysis and in situ batch tests both showed the co existence of aob nob anammox bacteria n damo bacteria and n damo archaea and aerobic methanotrophs in the biofilm fig 3 and 4 based on the availability of oxygen the biofilm could be divided into two layers i e the aerobic layer and anaerobic layer fig 8 similar to granule and biofilm in pn a systems ali et al 2016 liu et al 2017 vlaeminck et al 2010 it is speculated that the aerobic layer is developed on the biofilm surface next to the bulk liquid while the anaerobic layer is formed at inner layer where oxygen is depleted with oxygen available in aerobic layer aob and nob partially convert ammonium to nitrite major and nitrate minor while aerobic methanotrophs oxidize methane into co2 the produced nitrite and nitrate further penetrate into the anaerobic layer where anammox bacteria n damo bacteria and n damo archaea jointly contribute to the removal the microbial stratification and micro scale substrate profiles inside the biofilm matrix require experimental evidences in the future 4 conclusions in this study a novel process i e one stage pnam was demonstrated to achieve high level nitrogen removal from mainstream wastewater the major conclusions and outcomes include coupling partial nitritation anammox and

16544,the application of partial nitritation and anammox to remove nitrogen from mainstream wastewater is of great interest because of the potential to reduce energy cost and carbon dosage however this process confronts a dilemma of relatively high effluent nitrogen concentration 10 mg n l owning to the unwanted prevalence of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob and the intrinsic nitrate production by anammox bacteria here a novel technology named the one stage pnam that integrates partial nitritation anammox and methane dependent nitrite nitrate reduction reactions was developed in a single membrane biofilm reactor mbfr with feeding of synthetic mainstream wastewater containing 50 mg nh4 n l at a hydraulic retention time of 12 h more than 95 nitrogen was removed in the established one stage pnam process at a practically useful rate of 0 1 kg n m3 d microbial community characterization and in situ batch tests revealed a sophisticated microbial structure consisting of ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob anammox bacteria nitrite nitrate dependent anaerobic methane oxidation n damo bacteria and archaea and a small fraction of nob and aerobic methanotrophs the role of methane in removing nitrate was confirmed by switching on off the methane supply which relaxed the requirement for nob suppression in addition the established system was relatively robust against temperature variations evidenced by a total nitrogen removal efficiency above 80 at temperature as low as 14 the results provide a promising alternative for efficient nitrogen removal from domestic wastewater using methane as the sole carbon source graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anammox anaerobic methane oxidation nitrite nitrate dependent anaerobic methane oxidation n damo mainstream one stage membrane biofilm reactor 1 introduction autotrophic nitrogen removal via partial nitritation reaction 1 nh4 1 5o2 no2 2h h2o and anammox reaction 2 nh4 1 32no2 1 02n2 0 26no3 2 03h2o has attracted increasing attention over the past decades owning to its abilities to reduce aeration consumption and to remove nitrogen without organic carbon jetten et al 1997 kartal et al 2010 mulder et al 1995 strous et al 1999 therefore the achievement of a stable partial nitritation and anammox pn a process renders an attractive potential to drive wastewater treatment process towards energy neutrality nevertheless the pn a process has been only applied in treating high strength wastewater e g anaerobic digestion liquor and landfill leachate 500 1500 mg n l until now lackner et al 2014 while the attempts in low strength wastewater e g domestic sewage 40 60 mg n l only succeeded within laboratory reactors de clippeleir et al 2013 lackner et al 2015 li et al 2016 lotti et al 2014a ma et al 2013 meng et al 2021 wang et al 2021 moreover nitrate was usually accumulated in effluent of pn a process at a concentration of 5 15 mg n l in these successful laboratory demonstrations this is because of either the unwanted activity of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob or the intrinsic nitrate production in anammox reaction regarding the attempts in large scale it is difficult to maintain stable pn a performance due to wastewater dynamics thus accumulating even more nitrate in effluent gustavsson et al 2020 trojanowicz et al 2016 recently new technologies have been developed to improve the anammox based technologies of which combining anammox and methane dependent nitrite nitrate reduction is an attractive alternative in relative to traditional organic carbon e g methanol and acetate methane is inexpensive and widely available as the major component in biogas generated from anaerobic digesters calderon et al 2021 lv et al 2019 indeed these new technologies were originally designed based on the discovery of an bacterial group reaction 3 3ch4 8no2 8h 3co2 4n2 10h2o and an archaeal group reaction 4 ch4 4no3 co2 4no2 2h2o capable of performing nitrite and nitrate dependent anaerobic methane oxidation n damo respectively ettwig et al 2010 haroon et al 2013 raghoebarsing et al 2006 in cooperation with anammox bacteria n damo microorganisms enable a more robust nitrogen removal performance against wastewater dynamics and a better effluent quality in terms of less residual nitrogen along with the growing understanding of these new microbial processes the technologies are also evolving in particular for the biomass aggregation types applied i e from suspended biomass bhattacharjee et al 2016 luesken et al 2011 van kessel et al 2018 zhu et al 2011 to biofilm and granule liu et al 2021 liu et al 2020b xie et al 2018 notably a two stage concept has been used for the most of methane based technologies bhattacharjee et al 2016 liu et al 2021 liu et al 2020b luesken et al 2011 zhu et al 2011 in which anammox and n damo microorganisms grow in an anaerobic reactor as the second stage relying on the ammonium and nitrite generated by the upstream partial nitritation as the first stage the reason for the separation of aerobic and anaerobic processes in two sequential reactors in these previous studies was to avoid oxygen inhibition to anaerobic microorganisms as reported the activities of n damo bacteria and n damo archaea could be inhibited at trace level of oxygen guerrero cruz et al 2018 luesken et al 2012 van kessel et al 2021 nevertheless compared to the two stage configuration it is well acknowledged that combining aerobic and anaerobic processes in one single reactor exhibits more advantages such as lower capital investment less n2o emission and mitigated nitrite inhibition risk vlaeminck et al 2012 according to a survey based study about 90 of full scale sidestream pn a systems were achieved in one stage configuration lackner et al 2014 very recently a novel one stage technology coupling partial nitritation anammox and methane dependent nitrite nitrate reduction i e pnam process has been successfully demonstrated in a membrane biofilm reactor mbfr treating sidestream wastewater 1000 mg nh4 n l liu et al 2019 under oxygen limiting conditions the system achieved about 98 nitrogen removal while suppressing the activities of other unwanted microorganisms such as nob and aerobic methanotrophs until now the novel pnam process has been only applied for sidestream wastewater while the demonstration in mainstream wastewater is not available despite the significances practical relevance and fundamental interests firstly there is an urgent need to develop a new technology to deal with the difficulties that mainstream pn a process encounters as aforementioned theoretically the addition of methane as an alternative carbon source in pnam process could relax the requirement for nob suppression and allow the system with more robustness moreover the application of pnam in mainstream wastewater is of more practical relevance because the mainstream wastewater accounts for more than 80 of total nitrogen tn loading of a wastewater treatment plant wwtp more importantly different from the sidestream wastewater the mainstream wastewater has lower temperature 10 25 c vs 35 c and nitrogen concentration 20 60 mg tn l 1 vs 500 1500 mg tn l 1 lotti et al 2014b which will fundamentally increase difficulties to achieve the pnam process this study aims to assess the feasibility of achieving high level nitrogen removal from low strength mainstream wastewater based on the novel one stage pnam process to this end a laboratory scale methane supplied mbfr fed with synthetic wastewater mimicking domestic sewage was set up and operated for over 430 days in total the reactor was initially operated under anaerobic condition to develop anaerobic biofilms coupling anammox and n damo reactions oxygen was then supplied at a controlled rate aiming to cultivate aob at biofilm surface thus achieving pn anammox and n damo reactions in a single biofilm eventually 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing was conducted to investigate microbial community structure in particular to verify the presence of aob anammox bacteria n damo bacteria and n damo archaea in the biofilm a series of in situ batch tests were performed to confirm their respective contribution to the high level nitrogen removal achieved furthermore the role of methane and the response of established system against temperature variation 14 24 in mainstream wastewater were examined the outcomes of this study are potentially beneficial for the process upgradation of wwtps 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor configuration and setup as delineated in fig 1 an mbfr with a total volume of 310 ml was set up the column reactor contained a bunch of submerged hollow fiber membrane for methane delivery and biofilm development the overflow bottle was used for gas and liquid sampling as well as ph oakton australia and do hach hq40d usa monitoring specifically the hollow fiber membrane module comprising 260 non porous polypropylene hollow fibers teijin fibers ltd japan took up a volume of 1 4 ml for fiber materials and 0 4 ml for fiber lumen the outer diameter of the hollow fiber bundle was 200 μm giving an area volume ratio of 158 m2 m3 while one side of hollow fiber membrane was connected to a compressed gas cylinder 95 ch4 and 5 co2 coregas australia through a gas gage ross brown australia the other side was sealed to avoid methane escaping the lumen pressure was maintained at 200 kpa constantly in addition an air stone was placed in the overflow bottle which was connected to a vacuum pump via an air flow meter to produce fine bubbles at controlled flowrates from day 161 synthetic feeding mimicking the mainstream domestic sewage was prepared and stored in a 2 l feed tank which was transferred into the reactor by a peristaltic pump masterflex l s usa to limit the uncontrolled oxygen penetration and maintain the normal gas pressure inside the feed tank was connected to a 2 l gas bag tedlar australia filled with n2 gas the influent nitrogen compositions in different phases are summarized in table 1 while trace elements were also supplemented in the feeding according to ettwig et al 2009 to mix the liquid the bulk liquid was recirculated by a peristaltic pump bt300 2 j longer china the ph of bulk liquid was maintained at 7 0 0 5 by dosing 1 m hcl or 2 m naoh manually the temperature was controlled at 22 1 in a temperature controlled lab the water seal bottle was used to collect the washed out biomass as well as to prevent air back diffusion into the reactor 2 2 operational strategies and conditions the experiment consisted of three major phases including two stage phase inoculation phase and one stage phase table 1 initially the reactor was inoculated with 100 ml suspended culture volatile suspended solid vss 3 g l from a lab scale parent reactor consisting of anammox and n damo microorganisms haroon et al 2013 and operated under strictly anaerobic condition in order to demonstrate the two stage nitrogen removal concept the two stage phase day 1 150 included three sub phases in which the ratio of influent nitrite to ammonium changed from 1 06 to 1 51 to test the robustness of the system against influent dynamics the hydraulic retention time hrt was set to be 12 h afterwards the reactor was inoculated with enriched aob biomass from a laboratory sequential bioreactor treating high strength wastewater 800 1000 mg n l lim et al 2021 and operated in batch mode for 10 days day 151 160 during this period only stock solutions of ammonium chloride 46 g nh4 n l 1 and sodium nitrite 32 g no2 n l 1 were manually added to avoid biomass wash out the concentrations of ammonium and nitrite were maintained in the range of 0 240 mg n l and 0 30 mg n l respectively during the inoculation phase in addition the wash out biomass 2 ml in total which settled at the bottom of the settling bottle was collected and manually returned to the reactor on daily basis for re attachment from day 161 the reactor was continuously fed with synthetic mainstream wastewater at hrt of 12 h ammonium was the only nitrogen compound in influent based on the reactor performance the air supply rate was set to be 0 1 l d from day 161 to 198 which was changed to 0 2 l d on day 199 and to 0 15 l d on day 226 when the reactor reached a steady state a series of in situ batch tests were designed and carried out to determine the microbial activities role of methane and impact of temperature variations as elaborated in the following sections effluent samples 2 ml were taken two or three times per week to determine the concentrations of nitrogen compounds ammonium nitrite and nitrate biofilm samples were taken on day 130 180 250 300 and 325 for microbial community analysis the chemical analysis and microbial community characterization methods i e 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing are based on previous studies chen et al 2020 wang et al 2020 as described in details in supplementary information si 2 3 in situ batch tests to determine the microbial activities in order to determine the active bio reactions in the developed biofilm seven in situ batch tests were conducted at the end of the one stage phase day 326 355 table 2 before each batch test methane supply from the hollow fiber was stopped for batch a b c and d the reactor was flushed with methane gas 95 ch4 5 co2 for 15 min at the beginning of each test giving an initial dissolved methane concentration about 18 mg ch4 l among all the condition of batch a was the same to the long term operation with ammonium oxygen and methane available which was conducted in triplicate to confirm the reproducibility of the short term tests specifically the reactor was spiked with ammonium at 25 mg n l and do was controlled at 0 1 0 05 mg l batch b and c were designed to examine the activities of n damo bacteria and n damo archaea under anaerobic condition with an initial spiking of nitrite and nitrate at 25 mg n l respectively batch d was designed to study the activity of aerobic methanotrophs in which oxygen and methane were available in batch e f and g the dissolved methane was firstly stripped by flushing the reactor with nitrogen gas for 15 min batch e was designed to investigate the one stage pn a process without influence of methane with the initial ammonium concentration set to be 25 mg n l and the do concentration controlled at 0 1 0 05 mg l similarly batch f was used to investigate the nob activity with the initial nitrite adjusted to 25 mg n l and do controlled at 0 1 0 05 mg l batch g was used to test the anammox activity under anaerobic condition in which the initial ammonium and nitrite concentrations were both adjusted to 25 mg n l in each test liquid samples were taken at 0 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 h to determine the concentrations of nitrogen species and dissolved methane 2 4 in situ batch tests to confirm the role of methane to further verify the role of methane and to examine the system robustness against the short term methane depletion the mbfr was operated without day 356 to 375 and with day 376 to 415 methane supply in sequence for two months in total in addition to the methane supply other operational parameters were remaining unchanged in this two month examination effluent samples 2 ml were taken two or three times per week to determine the concentrations of ammonium nitrite and nitrate moreover to study the variation of activities of n damo bacteria and n damo archaea without and with methane supply short term batch tests similar to batch b and c in table 2 were performed weekly briefly the activities of n damo bacteria and n damo archaea were calculated in 6 h tests with addition of methane and nitrite and methane and nitrate respectively 2 5 in situ batch tests to investigate system response against temperature variations considering the temperature variation of mainstream wastewater the response of the established system to the temperature change was investigated day 416 430 four runs at different temperature levels 24 22 18 and 14 were carried out consecutively with each lasting for 3 days corresponding to 6 hrt the temperature was regulated and controlled by an immersion cooler rc1 ratek australia together with a precision immersion heater circulator th8000 ratek australia in all these tests the influent tn concentration was kept constant at 50 mg n l and the oxygen supply was maintained at 0 15 l d liquid samples were taken every 12 h to determine the concentrations of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n 3 results and discussion 3 1 two stage and one stage nitrogen removal from mainstream wastewater the mbfr was established and operated for 430 days in total mainly including the two stage phase day 1 150 and the one stage phase day 161 325 fig 2 in two stage phase the mbfr operated under anaerobic conditions was designed to treat partially nitrified mainstream wastewater from the first stage i e partial nitritation fig 2a at the beginning of two stage phase day 1 55 the influent nitrite to ammonium ratio was set to be 1 06 fig 2b a decreasing trend was observed for the concentrations of nitrite and nitrate in effluent which reached 0 mg n l and 1 1 mg n l at the end of this period however the effluent ammonium concentration fluctuated at a relatively higher level with an average value of 4 7 mg n l this phenomenon indicated the limitation of nitrite which restricted the anammox activity to further remove ammonium therefore from day 56 the influent nitrite to ammonium ratio was increased to 1 29 with the total nitrogen unchanged to improve the ammonium removal as expected the effluent ammonium declined to about 2 4 mg n l following such change while the nitrite was stably at 0 mg n l this observation confirmed that the limitation of nitrite was responsible for the residual ammonium in effluent and the system also had overcapacity to cope with the nitrite increase in influent notably the nitrate concentration in effluent increased firstly due to the increased production by anammox reaction and then decreased because of the enhanced activity of n damo archaea to further push the ammonium removal and examine the system robustness against influent variations the influent nitrite to ammonium ratio was increased to 1 51 on day 105 upon this change the ammonium in effluent declined to about 0 7 mg n l while the nitrite was maintained to be undetectable the effluent nitrate at steady state was 1 7 mg n l at average giving rise to a tn removal efficiency above 95 fig 2b on day 151 the mbfr was inoculated with enriched aob and operated in batch mode for 10 days for biofilm attachment data not shown afterwards the mbfr was switched to the one stage phase which was fed with synthetic mainstream wastewater only 51 5 mg nh4 n l continuously at an hrt of 12 h for about 165 days with different air flowrates fig 2c in order to avoid the oxygen inhibition to anaerobic microorganisms the air flowrate was controlled to be only 0 1 l d from day 161 to day 198 fig 2d leading to an average do level of 0 07 mg l due to the insufficient oxygen supply the residual ammonium in effluent was above 8 mg n l while the nitrite and nitrate concentrations were only 0 1 mg n l and 0 3 mg n l on average respectively this result suggested that the aerobic ammonia oxidation was limited therefore from day 199 the oxygen flowrate was elevated to 0 2 l d following such change the ammonium in effluent immediately decreased to below 2 mg n l nevertheless the do level was unstable and varied in a broad range of up to 0 5 mg l meanwhile the nitrate concentration in effluent dramatically increased to up to 8 6 mg n l indicating the inhibited n damo archaea activity at such high do level to achieve stable nitrogen removal performance the air flowrate was declined to 0 15 l d from day 226 following this change the nitrate concentration in effluent gradually dropped back to below 5 0 mg n l in a week and to below 1 0 mg n l after about 40 days while the ammonium concentration in effluent increased slightly and maintained at an average value of 2 5 mg n l during this period the do concentration was well controlled below 0 1 mg l while the tn removal efficiency reached up to 95 4 fig 2d corresponding to the hrt of 12 h the tn removal rate was about 0 1 kg n m3 d this result indicated the success of achieving one stage nitrogen removal in the experiment 3 2 microbial community characterization the microbial community structure was elucidated by 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing during the entire experiment fig 3 at genus level n damo bacteria n damo archaea and anammox bacteria were detected in all biofilm samples taken during two stage day 130 and one stage phases day 180 250 300 and 325 fig 3a while candidatus methylomirabilis n damo bacteria dominated all biofilms with relative abundance of 4 8 30 7 candidatus methanoperedens n damo archaea and candidatus brocadia anammox bacteria were observed with less relative abundances of 1 0 7 5 and 0 5 3 5 respectively on the other hand aerobic microorganisms including aob nob and aerobic methanotrophs were detected in biofilms taken during one stage period specifically nitrosomonas aob which was undetectable in two stage phase day 130 was determined to be 0 1 0 4 in one stage period day 180 250 300 and 325 moreover the total relative abundance of aerobic methanotrophs such as methylocystis methylophilus methylocaldum and methylococcus were calculated to be 0 3 1 8 nitrospira which was initially undetectable in one stage phase day 180 increased to 0 1 0 2 during the experiment variations in relative abundances of anaerobic and aerobic microbial groups with known functions during one stage phase were further analyzed and presented in fig 3b firstly anaerobic microorganisms considerably dominated over aerobic populations while the relative abundances of anammox bacteria n damo bacteria and n damo archaea in all samples were above 1 the aerobic groups including aob nob and aerobic methanotrophs only accounted for less than 1 of the total microbial community this result indicated that the majority of biofilm was under anaerobic condition likely because the limited oxygen 0 1 mg l detected on the biofilm surface could not penetrate into the inside of biofilm on the other hand the results also verified that anaerobic microbes including anammox bacteria n damo bacteria and n damo archaea could be well sustained under oxygen limiting conditions 0 1 mg l while aob were successfully enriched after supplying oxygen into the reactor nob were also developing in the biofilms however it should be noted that the nitrate concentration in effluent remained at a low level 1 mg n l in most of the time fig 2c the functions of other microbial populations remain to be investigated which likely live on the lysate and perhaps more importantly carbon compounds excreted by other organisms lawson et al 2017 a recent study reported that n damo archaea could produce acetate from methane via intracellular storage compounds e g polyhydroxyalkanoate and glycogen cai et al 2019 which also supported the growth of other partners given the predominance of anaerobic condition in the biofilm nitrate and nitrite were likely the main electron acceptors for these organisms for example denitratisoma which might be capable of heterotrophic denitrification was detected with relative abundance of 0 8 4 4 such a potential denitrifier was previously detected in other n damo bai et al 2019 wu et al 2019 and anammox based systems cao et al 2016 wang et al 2017a similarly candidatus roizmanbacteria with a high relative abundance 3 7 15 6 was observed in other n damo cultures as well lim et al 2021 liu et al 2021 which belongs to a superphylum candidate parcubacteria without cultured representatives león zayas et al 2017 several microorganisms affiliated to anaerolineaceae family were also observed as flanking partners in n damo hu et al 2015 lu et al 2016 and anammox cultures kindaichi et al 2012 lawson et al 2017 which were speculated to play a role in biomass aggregation gao et al 2011 and live on organic carbon from cell lysis for growth cao et al 2016 kindaichi et al 2012 3 3 determination of species specific microbial activities by in situ batch tests at the steady state of operation in situ batch tests were performed under different conditions aiming to decouple the combined reactions and to decipher the interactions among different microbial populations fig 4 and table s1 firstly methane was supplied in batch a to batch d to illustrate the respective role of methane oxidizers in the system notably the condition of batch a with ammonium and methane supplied at do of 0 1 mg l was similar to that applied during long term operation therefore batch a was treated as the positive control including all potential functional reactions in the 6 h test ammonium and methane simultaneously decreased without accumulation of nitrite or nitrate fig 4a this result was in line with the observation during long term operation that ammonium was removed with very limited nitrite or nitrate accumulated 1 mg n l fig 2c in batch b and c methane was supplied with nitrite or nitrate respectively to determine the role of methane dependent nitrite i e n damo bacteria and nitrate i e n damo archaea removal based on the observation of simultaneous consumption of methane and nitrite nitrate fig 4b and c the rate of n damo bacteria was determined to be 40 9 and 30 7 mg n l d in batch b and c respectively while the rate of n damo archaea was calculated to be 37 2 mg n l d in batch c table 3 moreover to identify the contribution of aerobic methanotrophs methane was supplied in batch d with oxygen as the only electron acceptor fig 4d as expected the rate of aerobic methane oxidation was only 2 4 mg ch4 l d which was one order of magnitude lower than the anaerobic methane oxidation rate 23 6 mg ch4 l d measured in batch c indicating that aerobic methanotrophs played a minor role for the methane consumption in the system additionally the roles of other functional populations were also investigated in batch e with ammonium and oxygen a similar ammonium consumption rate 90 8 mg n l d was observed in comparison to batch a 89 3 mg n l d whereas nitrate gradually accumulated to 3 2 mg n l in 6 h fig 4e while the activity of nob in batch a 1 9 mg n l d and e 2 9 mg n l d was both determined to be low the difference in nitrate concentration again confirmed the role of methane in nitrate removal moreover the addition of methane showed a weak impact on ammonium consumption rate likely because of the counter diffusion of ammonium i e from biofilm surface to substratum and methane i e from biofilm substratum to surface under conditions with sufficient nitrite and without other competitors in batch f the nitrite conversion to nitrate was observed fig 4f and the rate of nob was calculated to be 14 3 mg n l d according to the increase of nitrate concentration in batch g with unlimited nitrite and ammonium under anaerobic condition fig 4g the maximal activity of anammox bacteria was determined to be 73 4 mg no2 n l d table 3 based on the results obtained from in situ batch tests the species specific nitrogen methane conversion rates of each microbial group were summarized in table 3 firstly mass balance calculation was performed to confirm the active reactions for example the ratio of nitrite reduction to methane oxidation in batch b and the ratio of nitrate reduction to methane oxidation in batch c were determined to be 2 48 and 1 55 respectively which were slightly higher than the theoretical values of 2 33 and 1 40 based on the reactions of n damo bacteria and n damo archaea reactions 3 and 4 these observations indicated the active activities of n damo bacteria and n damo archaea as well as the minor contribution by other nitrogen scavengers e g heterotrophic denitrifiers moreover comparisons among different batch tests could also provide more in depth understanding about the microbial interaction for instance the comparison of the activity of nob in batch a e and f leads to a conclusion that the involvement of nitrite competitors i e anammox bacteria and n damo bacteria could well suppress the activity of nob in the biofilm similarly the availability of nitrite was also found to be a limiting factor for the activity of n damo bacteria and anammox bacteria if comparing batch b to batch a c and batch g to batch a e these results suggested that the contribution of n damo bacteria and anammox bacteria to nitrogen removal during the normal long term operation of the mbfr was limited by the low level nitrite 3 4 determination of species specific microbial activities during long term operation the species specific nitrogen conversion rates during long term operation were calculated as described in si and presented in fig 5 during the two stage phase following the increase of nitrite concentration in influent the nitrite removal rate by anammox bacteria maintained relatively stable at about 50 mg n l d while the rate by n damo bacteria gradually increased from 0 to 15 mg n l d fig 5a this phenomenon suggested that the system robustness against influent nitrite dynamics was indeed supported by n damo bacteria when the influent nitrite to ammonium ratio increased to above the level that anammox bacteria could deal with the residual nitrite would be removed by n damo bacteria thus maintaining a low level of nitrite in effluent constantly at the final stage of two stage phase the nitrite removal rate by anammox bacteria was about 3 times higher than that by n damo bacteria indicating anammox bacteria made a major contribution to nitrogen removal notwithstanding the role of n damo bacteria in alleviating the impact of influent nitrite to ammonium ratio dynamics at the beginning of one stage phase the activities of all microorganisms slightly increased with a limited air supply fig 5b notably the nitrite removal rate by n damo bacteria 15 mg n l d and the nitrate removal rate by n damo archaea 10 mg n l d kept at the similar levels in comparison to the end of two stage phase this consistency indicated that the activities of n damo microorganisms were not affected by the supply of limited oxygen however when the air supply was doubled from day 199 a dramatic decrease in n damo archaeal activity to almost 0 was observed suggesting that n damo archaea were completely inhibited during the period with high oxygen flux as the experiment continued the activity of n damo archaea recovered to the previous level in about 10 days when the air flux was decreased back to 0 15 l d at the steady state of one stage phase anammox bacteria was responsible for about 75 of the nitrite removed while n damo bacteria contributed to the rest moreover the nitrate removal rate by n damo archaea reached slightly above 10 mg n l d which could cope with the total nitrate generated from anammox bacteria and nob thus maintaining a satisfactory effluent quality 3 5 verification of the role of methane to further verify the role of methane in the proposed one stage pnam system the methane supply was stopped from day 356 for 20 days following the methane depletion the nitrate in effluent gradually accumulated to up to 5 3 mg n l fig 6 a meanwhile the ammonium in effluent maintained at 3 6 1 0 mg n l while the nitrite was always below the detection limit 0 02 mg n l fig 6c during this period the average nitrate production rate to ammonium removal rate was 0 10 which was close to the theoretical value i e 0 11 such phenomenon indicated that the nitrate accumulation was because of anammox reaction rather than nob growth corresponding to this change the tn removal efficiency was determined to be 83 9 on average fig 6d from day 376 methane was resupplied from the hollow fiber leading to an immediate decrease in the nitrate concentration in effluent to 1 0 mg n l on average meanwhile the nitrite in effluent remained to be negligible and the ammonium fluctuated around 4 mg n l jointly resulting in a tn removal efficiency above 90 this observation suggested that the system was robust against the short term methane depletion which could be recovered quickly once the methane was resupplied such robustness was also reflected by the maximal activities of n damo archaea and n damo bacteria measured weekly fig 6b specifically there was no significant change for the maximal activities of n damo archaea and n damo archaea during the experiment indicating that these anaerobic methane scavengers could stay alive under starvation for a certain period collectively the system was robust against short term methane depletion and the addition of methane was further confirmed to be responsible for nitrate removing warranting a satisfactory effluent quality 3 6 response to temperature variations the temperature of domestic mainstream wastewater usually changes seasonally therefore the response of the established system against temperature variations was studied fig 7 four temperature levels were selected including 26 22 18 and 14 notably the tn removal efficiency was maintained to be above 80 even at temperature as low as 14 highlighting the applicability of the process to mainstream wastewater in practice specifically at temperature of 26 and 22 the effluent contained 1 0 mg no3 n l and 4 0 mg nh4 n l on average with no nitrite detected fig 7a giving rise to an average tn removal efficiency above 90 fig 7b when the temperature was declined to 18 the ammonium p 0 01 and nitrate p 0 05 concentrations in effluent significantly increased leading to a decrease in tn removal efficiency to 85 7 interestingly the nitrite concentration in effluent remained to be 0 mg n l at 18 indicating that the nitrite consumption was more robust than ammonium and nitrate this could be associated with the fact that there were two nitrite scavengers in the system i e anammox bacteria and n damo bacteria which could provide the system with a certain level of overcapacity furthermore when the temperature was decreased to 14 nitrite started to be accumulated in effluent at an average level of 0 5 mg n l leading to a significant deterioration of the overall nitrogen removal performance p 0 01 these results showed that the removal of different nitrogenous compounds had different short term responses against the decrease in temperature although a previous study has showed the long term stability of nitrogen removal performance in a two stage anammox n damo process liu et al 2020a long term effects of low temperature on the present reactor should be further evaluated before applying the one stage pnam process in practice 3 7 methane as alternative carbon source driving high level nitrogen removal in mainstream wastewater in this study methane was used as the sole carbon source supporting a high level nitrogen removal from synthetic mainstream wastewater based on one stage pnam process fed with ammonium as the only nitrogen source a practically useful tn removal rate of 0 1 kg n m3 d was achieved with an average tn removal efficiency of 95 in the established biofilms functional microorganisms including aob anammox bacteria n damo bacteria and n damo archaea were successfully coupled together along with a small fraction of nob and aerobic methanotrophs while the pnam process was demonstrated in treating sidestream wastewater 1000 mg nh4 n l in a previous study liu et al 2019 this is the first study to demonstrate the feasibility of achieving high level nitrogen removal from mainstream wastewater 51 5 mg nh4 n l using such the process considering the fact that the mainstream wastewater contains more than 80 of tn loading in wwtps the demonstration in mainstream wastewater is of more relevance and significance for practical application in recent years the one stage pn a process has been widely studied to treat mainstream wastewater de clippeleir et al 2013 gilbert et al 2014 han et al 2016 hendrickx et al 2012 li et al 2016 lotti et al 2014b meng et al 2021 wang et al 2021 however the nitrate accumulation in pn a process either from the intrinsic production by anammox bacteria reaction 2 or from the uncontrollable activity of nob is critical for achieving satisfactory effluent quality to improve the tn removal efficiency external organic carbon needs to be further supplemented for removing nitrate however the addition of traditional organic carbon such as acetate and methanol will not only increase the operational cost of wastewater treatment but also lead to a problem for maintaining anammox activity on the one hand the activity of anammox bacteria was shown to be inhibited by some organic carbons e g methanol and alcohols güven et al 2005 isaka et al 2008 jensen et al 2007 on the other hand the availability of traditional organic carbon could result in the prevalence of heterotrophic denitrifiers which grow much faster and likely dominate over anammox bacteria chamchoi et al 2008 chen et al 2009 liu et al 2017 compared to traditional organic carbon methane is cheaper and in situ available in wwtps as it forms a large proportion of biogas generated from anaerobic digesters meanwhile methane shows no inhibitory effect to anammox bacteria and the combination of anammox bacteria and n damo microorganisms has been shown to be feasible and stable shi et al 2013 entailed with these advantages the proposed pnam process aims to use methane as an alternative caron source to achieve a high level effluent quality by using methane as electron donor the removal of nitrate by n damo archaea contributed to the much reduced effluent tn level specifically n damo archaea removed about 70 of the nitrate produced in the present study leading to an effluent nitrate concentration below 1 mg n l fig 2c especially the tn concentration in effluent was below 5 mg n l on average which are acceptable in most regions directive 1991 epa 2002 voudouris and voutsa 2012 the applied do concentration appears critical for the success of pnam process while low oxygen supply limited the ammonia oxidation high oxygen supply showed an inhibitory effect on the nitrogen removal by anaerobic microorganisms specifically with a low air flow rate of 0 1 l d the do level in reactor was well controlled to below 0 1 mg l evidenced by the extremely low nitrite and nitrate concentrations in effluent the anammox and n damo activities were not affected by the low oxygen concentration during this period fig 2c while n damo archaea and n damo bacteria in suspended form could be easily inhibited by even trace level of oxygen guerrero cruz et al 2018 luesken et al 2012 it appears that n damo microorganisms residing at the inner layer of biofilm were not affected by the limiting oxygen in bulk liquid in contrast doubling the air supply resulted in do increase to up to 0 5 mg l as well as an immediate ammonium decrease and nitrate accumulation jointly suggesting the inhibition to anammox and n damo microorganisms and the promotion for nob these results collectively showed that the oxygen supply should be controlled precisely in order to maintain sufficient aerobic ammonia oxidation while not to pose negative effect to anaerobic processes nonetheless a good sign should be noted is that when the do was decreased back to below 0 1 mg l the deteriorated nitrogen removal performance could be recovered in a relatively short time i e 1 2 weeks this showed a certain robustness of the system against do variations which is beneficial for practical application 3 8 double insurance to suppress nob growth and activity suppression of nob is a very critical step for short cut nitrogen removal which is a known challenge for mainstream wastewater previous studies have applied various strategies to achieve this aim such as low do control guo et al 2009 regmi et al 2014 sliekers et al 2005 and energy intensive or biocidal agents applied treatments wang et al 2017b zheng et al 2019 however the efficacy of these strategies was observed to decline after a long term operation because of the nob adaptation duan et al 2018 li et al 2020 zheng et al 2020 until now the nob suppression in mainstream wastewater treatment is still an unsolved problem in the present system nob were detected in the biofilms fig 3 and the activity was determined to be not negligible under optimal condition with sufficient nitrite and no competitors batch f in table 3 however intriguingly the nitrate concentration in the final effluent was kept below 1 mg n l at steady state during long term operation this disagreement indicated that the nob activity was suppressed during long term operation despite their existence in the biofilm on the one hand the nob activity was suppressed by the low oxygen applied as aforementioned the oxygen supply is vital for the success of pnam process the do concentration was maintained below 0 1 mg l in bulk liquid and was even lower inside biofilm which surely limited the activities of nob peng et al 2012 regmi et al 2014 sliekers et al 2005 on the other hand in the presence of ammonium and methane i e in the presence of competition for nitrite by anammox and n damo bacteria the activity of nob could be also suppressed evidenced by the dramatic decrease by about one order of magnitude in nob activity from batch f to batch a and e these multiple factors i e low oxygen and competition against other nitrite scavengers successfully suppressed the major activity of nob yet not completely indeed the activity of nob during long term operation should be similar to that measured in batch a under similar condition 1 9 mg n l d theoretically this slow nob activity together with the nitrate generated from anammox reaction could result in nitrate accumulation in effluent above 5 mg n l if without methane addition as shown in the present study fig 6 to further remove the residual nitrate and to obtain an effluent quality meeting the regulation standard the addition of methane in the present study is the second insurance with the supply of methane n damo archaea can convert nitrate back to nitrite further cross feeding anammox bacteria and n damo bacteria indeed the methane supply also relaxes the requirement for nob suppression notwithstanding the benefits of energy saving with nob suppression this relative flexibility of pnam process is much expected for application in practice moreover the applied 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing was unable to distinguish whether the detected nitrospira are canonical nob or the newly discovered complete ammonia oxidizers comammox daims et al 2015 van kessel et al 2015 further experiment using metagenomics or quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr would be useful to address this question 3 9 ecological model connecting nitrogen and methane cycles the established biofilm is an ideal ecological model to study the interactions of microbial populations in nitrogen and methane cycles microbial analysis and in situ batch tests both showed the co existence of aob nob anammox bacteria n damo bacteria and n damo archaea and aerobic methanotrophs in the biofilm fig 3 and 4 based on the availability of oxygen the biofilm could be divided into two layers i e the aerobic layer and anaerobic layer fig 8 similar to granule and biofilm in pn a systems ali et al 2016 liu et al 2017 vlaeminck et al 2010 it is speculated that the aerobic layer is developed on the biofilm surface next to the bulk liquid while the anaerobic layer is formed at inner layer where oxygen is depleted with oxygen available in aerobic layer aob and nob partially convert ammonium to nitrite major and nitrate minor while aerobic methanotrophs oxidize methane into co2 the produced nitrite and nitrate further penetrate into the anaerobic layer where anammox bacteria n damo bacteria and n damo archaea jointly contribute to the removal the microbial stratification and micro scale substrate profiles inside the biofilm matrix require experimental evidences in the future 4 conclusions in this study a novel process i e one stage pnam was demonstrated to achieve high level nitrogen removal from mainstream wastewater the major conclusions and outcomes include coupling partial nitritation anammox and n damo reactions in one single biofilm the reactor achieved an average tn removal efficiency of 95 at a practically useful rate of 0 1 kg n m3 d the addition of methane was confirmed to be responsible for the much reduced tn concentration in effluent the established biofilm system was relatively robust against short term methane depletion and temperature variations precise oxygen supply was critical to the success of pnam process low oxygen supply limited the ammonia oxidation while high oxygen supply deteriorated the nitrogen removal although nob were detected in the biofilms the activity was suppressed by multiple factors including low oxygen and competition with anammox bacteria and n damo bacteria declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known
