17840,synthetic polymers have been one of the defining environmental topics of the last decade synthetic polymers in the environment are usually classified by their size they encompass the widely discussed size fractions of macroplastic microplastic and nanoplastic water soluble polymers wsps however are mostly absent in this discussion in this paper we argue that wsps are produced in large quantities and have many applications that facilitate a discharge into the environment where their fate and impact remain mostly unclear we argue that there are yet no suitable analytical methods for the quantification of wsps in environmental matrices and propose an analytical method that utilizes size exclusion chromatography mass spectrometry to detect and potentially also quantify wsps through specific fragments generated by in source fragmentation with the detection of polyethylene glycol in a wastewater treatment plant effluent and a surface water sample we provide a first prove of principle for the applicability of this novel analytical approach to wsps ultimately we conclude that wsps are currently in a similar position as mp were in the advent of their investigation we know of an environmental contamination but are uncertain of its extent and impact and still lack the tools to investigate them thoroughly graphical abstract image 1 keywords water soluble synthetic polymers persistent mobile compounds analysis mass spectrometry aquatic environment 1 are water soluble polymers relevant environmental contaminants synthetic polymers in the environment are nowadays one of the academically socio economically and politically most controversially discussed topics triebskorn et al 2019 sharma and chatterjee 2017 echa i in this context especially polymer particles with varying sizes are discussed and investigated one major size fraction of these polymer particles is referred to as microplastics mp which has gained significant public and scientific attention albeit lacking a universally accepted definition hartmann et al 2019 a reasonable approach to define and classify synthetic polymers in the aquatic environment was suggested by hartmann et al 2019 besides polymer material and size a critical condition to fulfil the suggested definition for mp is the solid state and insolubility in water water soluble polymers wsps do not fit into this particle size based framework of polymer classification and thus need to be discussed separately the last decade of studying mp has demonstrated that the environmental analysis of synthetic polymers and the assessment of their impact on the ecosystem are exceedingly complex gregory and andrady 2003 fendall and sewell 2009 betts 2008 koelmans et al 2019 thus we believe that the efforts to understand the impacts of wsps on the ecosystem that are currently still in their infancy should be intensified arp and knutsen 2020 bertling et al 2018 the presence of a chemical in the aquatic environment may strongly depend on three major factors its production volume its applications that may or may not facilitate a release into the environment and its fate in the environment and during water treatment wsps applications are plentiful and often facilitate either a direct or indirect release into the environment table 1 applications of wsps in washing agents koltzenburg et al 2014 umoren et al 2006 cosmetics koltzenburg et al 2014 personal care products koltzenburg et al 2014 pharmaceuticals koltzenburg et al 2014 kadajji and betageri 2011 and many branches of industry e g textile industry koltzenburg et al 2014 umoren et al 2006 inevitably lead to the discharge of wsps into the sewage system rain runoff from applications in paints coatings and building materials koltzenburg et al 2014 taylor and nasr el din 1998 knapen and van gemert 2009 may also enter the sewage systems or are discharged into surface waters wsps in pesticide formulations fertilizers and other products used during crop cultivation are applied directly onto fields koltzenburg et al 2014 krogh et al 2003 xiong et al 2018 they may either sorb to soil and crops percolate into groundwater or are washed off during rain events into surface waters wsps that are used as flocculants during wastewater and drinking water production koltzenburg et al 2014 hoke 1971 sorb either to particulate matter e g sludge pocurull et al 2009 petrović and barceló 2000 or remain in the aqueous phase in seawater desalination wsps may be employed to prevent precipitation of salts from brine koltzenburg et al 2014 taylor and nasr el din 1998 and are then discharged with this brine these examples illustrate the high potential of wsps to enter the environment unlike most other chemicals in europe synthetic polymers are not registered under reach regulation evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals echa ii and thus information about their production volumes is often scarce or not freely available the educts of polymer synthesis however are reach registered and as long as there are no other major applications besides polymer production their production volume can be utilized to estimate the annual production of wsps in the european union estimations based on this approach place the total annual production of wsps in europe in the millions of tons range e g peg 106 t a echa iii paa 105 106 t a echa iv for each assuming wsp synthesis as the main application of the monomers and thus in the same order of magnitude as surfactants which are known to enter wastewater treatment plants in exceptionally high concentrations faria et al 2019 this high annual production in combination with many applications that facilitate a discharge of wsps result in a high potential for the presence of wsps in the environment for wsps released into the sewer system wastewater treatment may help to reduce its discharge into environment during wastewater treatment wsps can be removed by two mechanisms namely sorption and biotransformation which of these mechanisms takes a dominating role in wsp removal depends on the wsp type and its molecular weight mw generally higher mw wsps have a stronger sorption tendency krogh et al 2003 pocurull et al 2009 eubeler et al 2010 the mw where sorption becomes the dominant removal mechanism however may vary significantly between different wsp types biotransformation of wsps is also strongly dependent on the polymer type and decreases with increasing mw eubeler et al 2010 some wsps e g pvp have been shown to be persistent against biotic transformation even at low mw eubeler et al 2010 biotransformation of wsps often results in chain degradation and thus a mw reduction and a reduced sorption tendency trimpin et al 2001 as long as no complete mineralization is achieved the transformation products tps of lower mw are likely to remain in the aqueous phase consequently sorption to sludge remains likely the main elimination mechanism of high mw persistent wsps while all other wsps and their tps are likely discharged into the environment with the effluent if sewage sludge is subjected to thermal sludge recycling wsps sorbed to it are fully eliminated pocurull et al 2009 while the use of sludge as fertilizer in germany is intended to be phased out by 2032 wiechmann 2013 it is still practiced widely in many countries and consequently acts as an environmental entry pathway for sorbed wsps further degradation of sorbed wsps in the soil may result in reduction of the mw and a remobilization of tps that may then percolate to groundwater or be transported via runoff to surface waters uptake of monomers and low mw tps by crops may also be possible based on the limited data eubeler et al 2010 that is available so far the extent of removal of peg and pvp during wastewater treatment is not known and many other wsps are not yet investigated rendering the effective removal of wsps during wastewater treatment highly uncertain possibly incomplete removal in conjunction with high production volumes and applications facilitating a release into the aquatic environment lead to the conclusion that wsps are very likely present in the environment partially even in significant concentrations while this is certainly the case for persistent wsps arp and knutsen 2020 we assume that even biodegradable wsps like peg enter the environment in significant concentrations with yet unknown effects most wsps themselves are unlikely to cause direct eco toxicological effects i e peg itself only shows toxicity at very high parenteral doses webster et al 2009 albeit polymers are not part of reach as they are considered of low concern due to their high mw echa v their degradation products may be not pam can serve as prominent example for this case as its monomer acrylamide has carcinogenic and toxic characteristics echa vi generally wsp monomers and oligomers and their tps may fall into the chemical domain of persistent and mobile substances reemtsma et al 2016 and potentially toxic substances which are under discussion for regulation under reach neumann and schliebner 2017 indirect effects of wsps may be caused by one of their key functionalities facilitating the solubility and thus bioavailability of non polar substances as in pharmaceutical and agricultural formulations if environmental wsp concentrations are sufficient to also facilitate a mobilization or enhanced bioavailability of non polar chemicals this may be detrimental to aquatic ecosystems and increases their potential of exposure through the aqueous phase certainly any effect that wsps might have in the environment is intrinsically tied to the specific polymer class that is present and the concentrations both of which are largely unknown consequently wsps are chemicals with a high potential for release into the environment unknown environmental occurrence and concentrations and an unclear impact on the ecosystem thus we believe that they should be thoroughly studied alongside mp and nanoplastics np 2 which challenges do we face in the analysis of water soluble polymers as outlined above quantitative and qualitative information on the occurrence of wsps is very limited covering only a few polymer types and chain lengths petrović and barceló 2000 this may be attributed to a general lack of awareness in the scientific community arp and knutsen 2020 and some severe analytical challenges methods commonly used in the analysis of wsps are often used for rather pure products or formulations with no or only few other high mw constituents these methods like size exclusion chromatography sec coupled with a uv refraction index or evaporative light scattering detection are inherently unspecific and therefore may not be able to cope with the complex matrices present in environmental samples where naturally occurring macromolecules like humic substances are also present in addition these methods may also lack the sensitivity to detect wsps at environmental concentrations which may be in the μg l range instead of the g l range like in many product formulations lechner et al 2010 for these reasons the established methods for polymer analysis are not expected to be suitable for the determination of wsps in the environment depending on the polymer type and chain lengths wsp molecules may have sizes up to tens to hundreds of nanometres consequently a polymeric continuum may exist from monomers and oligomers that are truly dissolved over high mw polymeric colloids to particulate polymers like nps however method development for nps is still in its infancy and no established and reliable methods exist especially towards the lower end of the nm range schwaferts et al 2019 future developments in this field may be transferred to wsp analysis but depending on the underlying analytical principle their applicability to dissolved polymers is not guaranteed in contrast to the particular mp and np wsps are molecular organic pollutants and thus environmental trace analytical methods may be applied these methods usually combine a chromatographic separation of the analytes of interest with a sensitive and selective mass spectrometric detection these methods can cope with complex matrices and low environmental concentrations zwiener and frimmel 2004 in the case of wsps however analytical difficulties may arise from the complexity of the analytes itself organic trace contaminants are often defined by one or few specific ions the monoisotopic analyte and its isotopologues the structural variability and complexity of wsps results in numerous mass spectrometric signals that may differ only slightly or even overlap between different members of one polymer type this inherent complexity is further increased upon ionization by the formation of ions of multiple charge states and by adduct formation while pure polymer standards can be readily characterized with and without a chromatographic separation by high resolution mass spectrometry dimzon et al 2015 this is less promising for wsps in environmental matrices due to the lower concentrations and the co occurring signals of the environmental matrix here the differentiation between matrix and analyte signals may be complex but may be facilitated by computer assisted data evaluation tools quantification or organic contaminants by mass spectrometric detection relies on specific ions single ion monitoring sim or more commonly the combination of an ion and its product ions multiple reaction monitoring mrm gross 2006 the latter approach is exceptionally sensitive and selective the selection of these ions however is almost impossible for synthetic polymers due to their polydispersity multiple charge states and various adducts there is no single molecular ion that is representative for all chain lengths of a synthetic polymer consequently polymers like peg cannot be analysed as one analyte but rather every single peg chain length would have to be treated as a separate analyte for which there are still several charge states and adducts additionally the total concentration of a polymer type is distributed over multiple ions of different chain lengths charge states and adducts thus the intensity of single ions is expected to be low resulting in a poor sensitivity this is evident from a study by petrović et al petrović and barceló 2000 in which the sensitivity for peg was much lower than for other less polydisperse ionic and non ionic surfactants from this it can be concluded that traditional methods of polymer analysis may suffer from comparatively low environmental concentrations and complex matrices while methods used in np analysis are not yet established and may not even be suitable and quantitative trace analytical methods cannot cope with the complexity of the analytes themselves while mass spectrometry with computer assisted data treatment may prove valuable for polymer characterization quantification methods that sensitively and selectively capture polymer types instead of individual chain lengths are not yet present in our method portfolio 3 how can we overcome these challenges a proof of principle we propose a modification of mass spectrometry based trace analytical methods established for organic micro pollutants as a promising way forward in wsp analysis from environmental samples this modification combines high selectivity to cope with complex matrices and high sensitivity to cope with low environmental concentrations we propose an in source fragmentation of wsps to convert polymers of one type but different chain lengths into one or more specific fragment ions this reduces the analyte complexity and simultaneously increases the signal intensity fig 1 a first experiments we conducted with peg demonstrate that the nature of the fragment ions for peg c4h9o2 c6h13o3 c8h17o4 and c10h21o5 is independent from the chain lengths after in source fragmentation the wsp fragments are small organic ions and can thus be analysed either by a high resolution ms in scan mode which is essentially an orbitrap variant of mse or by a triple quad instrument in mrm mode which we hereinafter referred to as mrme mrm after initial in source fragmentation the applicability of this analytical concept to environmental samples is demonstrated by the analysis of peg in a wastewater treatment plant effluent and a surface water sample fig 1 b the solid phase enriched samples hlb cartridges waters darmstadt germany 50fold enrichment recoveries of spiked samples between 90 and 110 were injected onto an sec column pss suprema micro linear m 4 6 150 mm pss polymer standards service gmbh mainz germany isocratic elution with methanol water 70 30 containing 5 mm ammonium formate interfaced with an ab sciex 3200 triple quadrupole ms ab sciex darmstadt germany in mrm mode in source fragmentation of peg was provoked by increasing the declustering potential to 100 v through the hyphenation of ms to sec information about the mw distribution is retained despite the conversion of the polymer into low molecular mass fragment ions already during ionization this first experiment with peg determination in a wastewater treatment plant effluent and a surface water lead to concentration estimates in the double digit μg l range it can be seen as a proof of principle it also suggests that even biodegradable wsps are present in the aquatic environment conceptually this approach allows the sensitive quantification of wsps either as sum parameter per polymer type or in conjunction with the sec information mw specific however in its current state the approach still has drawbacks i some polymer types require fragmentation energies that cannot be provided during in source fragmentation especially for high mw polymers ii it is yet unclear if the method allows a differentiation between mixed polymer types e g peg and peg ppg copolymer or polymers and only terminally modified tps iii the ionization and fragmentation efficiencies for one type of polymer are mw dependent which complicates quantification the first issue may be overcome when utilizing a different instrument like a quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometer where fragmentation of all ions can be achieved in the collision cell enabling increased collision energies while the latter would require mw dependent response factors with the data presented herein it was proven that this methodology does in principle allow the sensitive analysis of wsps in environmental matrices with further development and refinement it might become the method of choice for wsp quantification in the environment 4 conclusions the current situation of wsps might be comparable to early stages of microplastics research we have a vague notion that there are substances present in the environment but are highly uncertain about their distribution concentrations and impact and lack suitable analytical methods to investigate them analytical method development validation and standardisation should have priority in the investigation of wsps since the reliable determination of wsp occurrence distribution and concentrations in the environment is a prerequisite for assessing their environmental risk it is imperative that we consider the lessons learned from a decade of microplastic research to avoid repetition of the same mistakes we should be critical towards the results published especially as long as no validated methods are available and consider actual environmental concentrations when assessing the impacts of wsps declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

17840,synthetic polymers have been one of the defining environmental topics of the last decade synthetic polymers in the environment are usually classified by their size they encompass the widely discussed size fractions of macroplastic microplastic and nanoplastic water soluble polymers wsps however are mostly absent in this discussion in this paper we argue that wsps are produced in large quantities and have many applications that facilitate a discharge into the environment where their fate and impact remain mostly unclear we argue that there are yet no suitable analytical methods for the quantification of wsps in environmental matrices and propose an analytical method that utilizes size exclusion chromatography mass spectrometry to detect and potentially also quantify wsps through specific fragments generated by in source fragmentation with the detection of polyethylene glycol in a wastewater treatment plant effluent and a surface water sample we provide a first prove of principle for the applicability of this novel analytical approach to wsps ultimately we conclude that wsps are currently in a similar position as mp were in the advent of their investigation we know of an environmental contamination but are uncertain of its extent and impact and still lack the tools to investigate them thoroughly graphical abstract image 1 keywords water soluble synthetic polymers persistent mobile compounds analysis mass spectrometry aquatic environment 1 are water soluble polymers relevant environmental contaminants synthetic polymers in the environment are nowadays one of the academically socio economically and politically most controversially discussed topics triebskorn et al 2019 sharma and chatterjee 2017 echa i in this context especially polymer particles with varying sizes are discussed and investigated one major size fraction of these polymer particles is referred to as microplastics mp which has gained significant public and scientific attention albeit lacking a universally accepted definition hartmann et al 2019 a reasonable approach to define and classify synthetic polymers in the aquatic environment was suggested by hartmann et al 2019 besides polymer material and size a critical condition to fulfil the suggested definition for mp is the solid state and insolubility in water water soluble polymers wsps do not fit into this particle size based framework of polymer classification and thus need to be discussed separately the last decade of studying mp has demonstrated that the environmental analysis of synthetic polymers and the assessment of their impact on the ecosystem are exceedingly complex gregory and andrady 2003 fendall and sewell 2009 betts 2008 koelmans et al 2019 thus we believe that the efforts to understand the impacts of wsps on the ecosystem that are currently still in their infancy should be intensified arp and knutsen 2020 bertling et al 2018 the presence of a chemical in the aquatic environment may strongly depend on three major factors its production volume its applications that may or may not facilitate a release into the environment and its fate in the environment and during water treatment wsps applications are plentiful and often facilitate either a direct or indirect release into the environment table 1 applications of wsps in washing agents koltzenburg et al 2014 umoren et al 2006 cosmetics koltzenburg et al 2014 personal care products koltzenburg et al 2014 pharmaceuticals koltzenburg et al 2014 kadajji and betageri 2011 and many branches of industry e g textile industry koltzenburg et al 2014 umoren et al 2006 inevitably lead to the discharge of wsps into the sewage system rain runoff from applications in paints coatings and building materials koltzenburg et al 2014 taylor and nasr el din 1998 knapen and van gemert 2009 may also enter the sewage systems or are discharged into surface waters wsps in pesticide formulations fertilizers and other products used during crop cultivation are applied directly onto fields koltzenburg et al 2014 krogh et al 2003 xiong et al 2018 they may either sorb to soil and crops percolate into groundwater or are washed off during rain events into surface waters wsps that are used as flocculants during wastewater and drinking water production koltzenburg et al 2014 hoke 1971 sorb either to particulate matter e g sludge pocurull et al 2009 petrović and barceló 2000 or remain in the aqueous phase in seawater desalination wsps may be employed to prevent precipitation of salts from brine koltzenburg et al 2014 taylor and nasr el din 1998 and are then discharged with this brine these examples illustrate the high potential of wsps to enter the environment unlike most other chemicals in europe synthetic polymers are not registered under reach regulation evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals echa ii and thus information about their production volumes is often scarce or not freely available the educts of polymer synthesis however are reach registered and as long as there are no other major applications besides polymer production their production volume can be utilized to estimate the annual production of wsps in the european union estimations based on this approach place the total annual production of wsps in europe in the millions of tons range e g peg 106 t a echa iii paa 105 106 t a echa iv for each assuming wsp synthesis as the main application of the monomers and thus in the same order of magnitude as surfactants which are known to enter wastewater treatment plants in exceptionally high concentrations faria et al 2019 this high annual production in combination with many applications that facilitate a discharge of wsps result in a high potential for the presence of wsps in the environment for wsps released into the sewer system wastewater treatment may help to reduce its discharge into environment during wastewater treatment wsps can be removed by two mechanisms namely sorption and biotransformation which of these mechanisms takes a dominating role in wsp removal depends on the wsp type and its molecular weight mw generally higher mw wsps have a stronger sorption tendency krogh et al 2003 pocurull et al 2009 eubeler et al 2010 the mw where sorption becomes the dominant removal mechanism however may vary significantly between different wsp types biotransformation of wsps is also strongly dependent on the polymer type and decreases with increasing mw eubeler et al 2010 some wsps e g pvp have been shown to be persistent against biotic transformation even at low mw eubeler et al 2010 biotransformation of wsps often results in chain degradation and thus a mw reduction and a reduced sorption tendency trimpin et al 2001 as long as no complete mineralization is achieved the transformation products tps of lower mw are likely to remain in the aqueous phase consequently sorption to sludge remains likely the main elimination mechanism of high mw persistent wsps while all other wsps and their tps are likely discharged into the environment with the effluent if sewage sludge is subjected to thermal sludge recycling wsps sorbed to it are fully eliminated pocurull et al 2009 while the use of sludge as fertilizer in germany is intended to be phased out by 2032 wiechmann 2013 it is still practiced widely in many countries and consequently acts as an environmental entry pathway for sorbed wsps further degradation of sorbed wsps in the soil may result in reduction of the mw and a remobilization of tps that may then percolate to groundwater or be transported via runoff to surface waters uptake of monomers and low mw tps by crops may also be possible based on the limited data eubeler et al 2010 that is available so far the extent of removal of peg and pvp during wastewater treatment is not known and many other wsps are not yet investigated rendering the effective removal of wsps during wastewater treatment highly uncertain possibly incomplete removal in conjunction with high production volumes and applications facilitating a release into the aquatic environment lead to the conclusion that wsps are very likely present in the environment partially even in significant concentrations while this is certainly the case for persistent wsps arp and knutsen 2020 we assume that even biodegradable wsps like peg enter the environment in significant concentrations with yet unknown effects most wsps themselves are unlikely to cause direct eco toxicological effects i e peg itself only shows toxicity at very high parenteral doses webster et al 2009 albeit polymers are not part of reach as they are considered of low concern due to their high mw echa v their degradation products may be not pam can serve as prominent example for this case as its monomer acrylamide has carcinogenic and toxic characteristics echa vi generally wsp monomers and oligomers and their tps may fall into the chemical domain of persistent and mobile substances reemtsma et al 2016 and potentially toxic substances which are under discussion for regulation under reach neumann and schliebner 2017 indirect effects of wsps may be caused by one of their key functionalities facilitating the solubility and thus bioavailability of non polar substances as in pharmaceutical and agricultural formulations if environmental wsp concentrations are sufficient to also facilitate a mobilization or enhanced bioavailability of non polar chemicals this may be detrimental to aquatic ecosystems and increases their potential of exposure through the aqueous phase certainly any effect that wsps might have in the environment is intrinsically tied to the specific polymer class that is present and the concentrations both of which are largely unknown consequently wsps are chemicals with a high potential for release into the environment unknown environmental occurrence and concentrations and an unclear impact on the ecosystem thus we believe that they should be thoroughly studied alongside mp and nanoplastics np 2 which challenges do we face in the analysis of water soluble polymers as outlined above quantitative and qualitative information on the occurrence of wsps is very limited covering only a few polymer types and chain lengths petrović and barceló 2000 this may be attributed to a general lack of awareness in the scientific community arp and knutsen 2020 and some severe analytical challenges methods commonly used in the analysis of wsps are often used for rather pure products or formulations with no or only few other high mw constituents these methods like size exclusion chromatography sec coupled with a uv refraction index or evaporative light scattering detection are inherently unspecific and therefore may not be able to cope with the complex matrices present in environmental samples where naturally occurring macromolecules like humic substances are also present in addition these methods may also lack the sensitivity to detect wsps at environmental concentrations which may be in the μg l range instead of the g l range like in many product formulations lechner et al 2010 for these reasons the established methods for polymer analysis are not expected to be suitable for the determination of wsps in the environment depending on the polymer type and chain lengths wsp molecules may have sizes up to tens to hundreds of nanometres consequently a polymeric continuum may exist from monomers and oligomers that are truly dissolved over high mw polymeric colloids to particulate polymers like nps however method development for nps is still in its infancy and no established and reliable methods exist especially towards the lower end of the nm range schwaferts et al 2019 future developments in this field may be transferred to wsp analysis but depending on the underlying analytical principle their applicability to dissolved polymers is not guaranteed in contrast to the particular mp and np wsps are molecular organic pollutants and thus environmental trace analytical methods may be applied these methods usually combine a chromatographic separation of the analytes of interest with a sensitive and selective mass spectrometric detection these methods can cope with complex matrices and low environmental concentrations zwiener and frimmel 2004 in the case of wsps however analytical difficulties may arise from the complexity of the analytes itself organic trace contaminants are often defined by one or few specific ions the monoisotopic analyte and its isotopologues the structural variability and complexity of wsps results in numerous mass spectrometric signals that may differ only slightly or even overlap between different members of one polymer type this inherent complexity is further increased upon ionization by the formation of ions of multiple charge states and by adduct formation while pure polymer standards can be readily characterized with and without a chromatographic separation by high resolution mass spectrometry dimzon et al 2015 this is less promising for wsps in environmental matrices due to the lower concentrations and the co occurring signals of the environmental matrix here the differentiation between matrix and analyte signals may be complex but may be facilitated by computer assisted data evaluation tools quantification or organic contaminants by mass spectrometric detection relies on specific ions single ion monitoring sim or more commonly the combination of an ion and its product ions multiple reaction monitoring mrm gross 2006 the latter approach is exceptionally sensitive and selective the selection of these ions however is almost impossible for synthetic polymers due to their polydispersity multiple charge states and various adducts there is no single molecular ion that is representative for all chain lengths of a synthetic polymer consequently polymers like peg cannot be analysed as one analyte but rather every single peg chain length would have to be treated as a separate analyte for which there are still several charge states and adducts additionally the total concentration of a polymer type is distributed over multiple ions of different chain lengths charge states and adducts thus the intensity of single ions is expected to be low resulting in a poor sensitivity this is evident from a study by petrović et al petrović and barceló 2000 in which the sensitivity for peg was much lower than for other less polydisperse ionic and non ionic surfactants from this it can be concluded that traditional methods of polymer analysis may suffer from comparatively low environmental concentrations and complex matrices while methods used in np analysis are not yet established and may not even be suitable and quantitative trace analytical methods cannot cope with the complexity of the analytes themselves while mass spectrometry with computer assisted data treatment may prove valuable for polymer characterization quantification methods that sensitively and selectively capture polymer types instead of individual chain lengths are not yet present in our method portfolio 3 how can we overcome these challenges a proof of principle we propose a modification of mass spectrometry based trace analytical methods established for organic micro pollutants as a promising way forward in wsp analysis from environmental samples this modification combines high selectivity to cope with complex matrices and high sensitivity to cope with low environmental concentrations we propose an in source fragmentation of wsps to convert polymers of one type but different chain lengths into one or more specific fragment ions this reduces the analyte complexity and simultaneously increases the signal intensity fig 1 a first experiments we conducted with peg demonstrate that the nature of the fragment ions for peg c4h9o2 c6h13o3 c8h17o4 and c10h21o5 is independent from the chain lengths after in source fragmentation the wsp fragments are small organic ions and can thus be analysed either by a high resolution ms in scan mode which is essentially an orbitrap variant of mse or by a triple quad instrument in mrm mode which we hereinafter referred to as mrme mrm after initial in source fragmentation the applicability of this analytical concept to environmental samples is demonstrated by the analysis of peg in a wastewater treatment plant effluent and a surface water sample fig 1 b the solid phase enriched samples hlb cartridges waters

germany isocratic elution with methanol water 70 30 containing 5 mm ammonium formate interfaced with an ab sciex 3200 triple quadrupole ms ab sciex darmstadt germany in mrm mode in source fragmentation of peg was provoked by increasing the declustering potential to 100 v through the hyphenation of ms to sec information about the mw distribution is retained despite the conversion of the polymer into low molecular mass fragment ions already during ionization this first experiment with peg determination in a wastewater treatment plant effluent and a surface water lead to concentration estimates in the double digit μg l range it can be seen as a proof of principle it also suggests that even biodegradable wsps are present in the aquatic environment conceptually this approach allows the sensitive quantification of wsps either as sum parameter per polymer type or in conjunction with the sec information mw specific however in its current state the approach still has drawbacks i some polymer types require fragmentation energies that cannot be provided during in source fragmentation especially for high mw polymers ii it is yet unclear if the method allows a differentiation between mixed polymer types e g peg and peg ppg copolymer or polymers and only terminally modified tps iii the ionization and fragmentation efficiencies for one type of polymer are mw dependent which complicates quantification the first issue may be overcome when utilizing a different instrument like a quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometer where fragmentation of all ions can be achieved in the collision cell enabling increased collision energies while the latter would require mw dependent response factors with the data presented herein it was proven that this methodology does in principle allow the sensitive analysis of wsps in environmental matrices with further development and refinement it might become the method of choice for wsp quantification in the environment 4 conclusions the current situation of wsps might be comparable to early stages of microplastics research we have a vague notion that there are substances present in the environment but are highly uncertain about their distribution concentrations and impact and lack suitable analytical methods to investigate them analytical method development validation and standardisation should have priority in the investigation of wsps since the reliable determination of wsp occurrence distribution and concentrations in the environment is a prerequisite for assessing their environmental risk it is imperative that we consider the lessons learned from a decade of microplastic research to avoid repetition of the same mistakes we should be critical towards the results published especially as long as no validated methods are available and consider actual environmental concentrations when assessing the impacts of wsps declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

17841,transparent exopolymer particles tep as gel like particulate acidic polysaccharide have been commonly found in marine surface water and wastewater currently increasing interest has been devoted to tep associated membrane fouling in different membrane systems for water and wastewater treatment thus this review attempts to provide a holistic view and critical analysis with regard to the definition formation detection and properties of tep which could ultimately determine its fouling potential it appears that there is not a common consensus on the actual role of tep in membrane fouling development due to the subjective definition and highly debatable detection method of tep it was clearly demonstrated in this review that the formation of tep was largely related to cations in water and wastewater which indeed determined the cross linking degree of precursor materials e g polysaccharides via intermolecular interactions and subsequently the quantity of tep formed the binding between cations ions e g monovalent divalent and trivalent cations and polysaccharide not only depends on the functional groups of polysaccharide but also its spatial configuration these in turn suggest that the formation property and ultimate fouling potential of tep would be closely related to the type and concentration of cations while well explaining the controversial reports on tep associated fouling in the literature in addition the fouling mechanisms of tep are also elucidated with details in this review including i the formation of tep associated gel layer on membrane surface ii carrying microorganisms to membrane surface via protobiofilm and iii trapping of deformable tep in membrane pores consequently it is apparent that tep is an ignored determinant of membrane fouling which has not yet been seriously addressed in the design and operation of membrane systems for water and wastewater treatment graphical abstract image 1 keywords transparent exopolymer particles membrane fouling common cations interaction of polysaccharide 1 introduction membrane technology has been widely used for water and wastewater treatment with membrane fouling being a major operational obstacle meng et al 2019a b shannon et al 2008 polysaccharide substance has been shown to play a critical role in the development of both organic fouling and biofouling of membrane due to its long molecule chain and gelling property drews 2010 meng et al 2017 rosenberger et al 2006 recently some studies have showed that polysaccharide could form three dimensional networks known as transparent exopolymer particles tep which may likely be related to fouling development in various membrane systems bar zeev et al 2015 berman et al 2011 discart et al 2013 meng et al 2013 however the fouling mechanism associated with tep still remains unclear tep has been widely detected in marine and fresh water environments with high abundance during seasonal algal blooms passow 2002a the unique characteristics of tep include high viscosity easy colonization by microorganism deformable structure etc bar zeev et al 2015 engel 2000 mopper et al 1995 passow and alldredge 1994 passow 2002b as such increasing attention has been recently dedicated to the fouling potential of tep in membrane systems for water and wastewater treatment it should be noted that there is active debate on the analytical methods of tep currently available in the literature the microscopic enumeration method only determines the abundance of tep accompanied with intensive labour and underestimation of the tep number passow and alldredge 1994 while the spectrophotometric method is divergent due to the sensitivity of alcian blue staining and the challenge in calibration passow and alldredge 1995 meng et al 2013 as the result reported tep concentrations quantified by different method appear to be hardly comparable this in turn makes tep related fouling studies uncertain and arguable obviously there is an urgent need to provide a thorough and systematic review of role of tep in membrane fouling development therefore this review aims to provide a holistic view and critical analysis with regard to the definition formation detection and properties of tep which could ultimately determine its fouling potential 2 definition formation and determination of tep 2 1 definition of tep tep was firstly found by alldredge et al 1993 when they stained the seawater samples with alcian blue which is specific for negatively charged polysaccharides in the past biological activities such as metabolism of bacteria were considered as necessary conditions in the conversion of dissolved organic matter dom to particulate organic matter pom the discovery of tep reveals that it s possible to convert dom to pom via an abiotic transformation tep can form from dom under abiotic action passow 2002b tep were operationally defined as particles retained by 0 4 μm track etched polycarbonate filters and stainable with alcian blue passow and alldredge 1994 1995 however there are some defects lying in the above determination method of tep thus more detection methods has been developed which in deed re defined tep currently tep are commonly known as clear gel like polysaccharides 2 2 formation mechanism of tep there are two pathways of the tep formation from dom in the natural water environments meng et al 2013 some plankton and bacteria directly produce tep which is mainly formed by the loss of polysaccharide fiber material immobilized on the cell surface tep can directly form from the precursor materials released by plankton in an abiotic pathway such as coagulation gelation and annealing the abiotic aggregation of precursor material is the main pathway for tep formation bar zeev et al 2015 passow 2012 wurl et al 2011 and this process is greatly promoted by cations passow 2002b verdugo 2012 for example the well known bridging ion calcium ions however there are many types of cations in the natural water environments such as the magnesium ion and the abundant monovalent cations which are rarely evaluated in the formation of tep in addition trivalent cations are often added before the membrane unit in the water treatment systems which poses a need to investigate the effect of trivalent cations on tep formation and fouling accordingly this article critically reviews the nature of tep in membrane fouling and the intricate relationships between tep and various cations in membrane systems before that the tep measurement methods must be introduced since the determination methods of tep not only detect the level of tep but also define what tep are 2 3 determination of tep the determination of tep in water samples is accomplished by alcian blue staining alcian blue selectively stains acidic polysaccharides by ionic binding to carboxyl and sulfated groups making tep visible and capable of quantification ramus 1977 this dye is the key factor to identify tep and has been employed in all tep assays except for the magic isolation method mari and dam 2004 however particles measured by this method indeed are not the originally defined tep and rare studies use it thus this method is not discussed in this review any more the alcian blue staining is subject to the characteristics of the water samples including the ph ionic strength and carbon and nitrogen content of tep anja and uta 2001 unfortunately the exact interaction mechanism between the alcian blue and a specific substrate is still not well known today although it has been widely used in medical and biological studies consequently researchers are still working on the optimation of the tep determination methods such as updating the calibration for tep measurement bittar et al 2018 what should be noticed is that discrepancy may occur when comparing tep related results from studies using different determination methods in the beginning tep were operationally defined as transparent particles that can be retained by 0 4 μm filters and are stainable with alcian blue alldredge et al 1993 with the increasing attention attracted by tep more and more determination methods have been developed and the definition of tep indeed has changed according to the location where the binding between tep and alcian blue happens the tep determination methods can be classified into two categories as separation staining method and direct staining method as shown in fig 1 the most popular method was the spectrophotometric method proposed by passow and alldredge 1995 although some changes have been introduced including using filters with smaller pore size li et al 2016a sim et al 2019 villacorte et al 2009a and modifications of the calibration process bittar et al 2018 villacorte et al 2009b this method and its updates share the same procedure that tep are first separated by filters and then stained by alcian blue on filters with this method tep are first identified by their size which is consistent with the original definition what s more important the staining ability and selectivity of alcian blue largely depends on the ph and ionic strength of the solution villacorte et al 2015a isolating tep from samples with filter can minimize the measurement artefacts due to the complicated chemical compositions of water samples the application of alcian blue staining to measure acid polysaccharides including tep in brackish and saline waters is mainly limited by the low stability of the dye and its sensitivity to water salinity these problems can be minimized by pre filtering the alcian blue solution through a 0 05 μm membrane and filtering the ultrapure water through a tep gel to rinse off the inorganic ions prior to alcian blue staining villacorte et al 2015a these methods can provide a semi quantitative evaluation of the tep level in water samples employing xanthan gum as standard substance until now these filtration staining methods are still the most extensively used methods in quantifying tep differently the other methods measure the tep by adding alcian blue into the water samples directly then the precipitates produced by tep and alcian blue interaction are separated by centrifugation arruda fatibello et al 2004 thornton et al 2007 or filtration villacorte et al 2015a the unreacted alcian blue in water is subsequently measured using a spectrophotometric method the difference between the total alcian blue added to the sample and the alcian blue left represents the amount of alcian blue reacted tep in the sample some pretreatments are employed according to the properties of water sample such as filtration with 70 μm nylon mesh arruda fatibello et al 2004 concentration of tep sample villacorte et al 2015a and dialyzing the samples with dialysis tubing thornton et al 2007 these methods don t separate tep from bulk solution and the tep measured indeed are not the tep first defined by alldredge et al 1993 tep differ from other dissolved organic substances in that they have large size which is characterized by filter separation it s reasonable to use filters with smaller pore size than 0 45 μm to look into the size distribution of tep and to determine the colloidal tep which can resemble to form tep under certain conditions however without filter separation it s difficult to define what have been measured in the tep tests in addition there may be more defects and inconsistencies lying in the tep results determined by these methods due to the fact that staining ability of alcian blue is highly subject to the chemical conditions of the sample nevertheless these methods still provide options when relevant information is needed 2 4 present controversy and challenges forward it s significant to choose a suitable method for tep determination according to the sample condition and objectives of study one of the main arguments of tep is the accuracy of tep analyses and thus leading to doubts regarding the usage of tep as a fouling indicator alcian blue staining is the key factor in defining tep alcian blue is a sensitive dye which stains not only tep but other substances in water samples besides the staining ability of alcian blue largely depends on the chemical condition of the place where staining happens accordingly based on our knowledge and experience we recommend the separation staining method for tep determination rather than the methods which directly add alcian blue into water samples separation staining method isolates tep first with chosen pore size and appropriate treatments can be performed before alcian blue addition to remove salinity such as ultra pure water rinsing these steps provide a controllable condition for tep staining with alcian blue thereby to create more reliable results although there are still defects in the tep determination methods the tep measurement still can work as an indicator of the aggregation extent of polysaccharide substances in water environments 3 tep an ignored ghost of membrane fouling nowadays the global demand for water is continuously increasing membrane technology has been the most promising technique for water and wastewater treatment while membrane fouling still remains as the biggest obstacle to the successful operation of membrane system elimelech and phillip 2011 recently more and more studies have shown that gel layer in spite of its high porosity and thinness shows remarkably high filtration resistance which is nearly one hundred times higher than that contributed by cake layer chen et al 2016 besides biofilm development on membrane is also the main reason and the most difficult fouling problem due to the physical and chemical properties of tep tep may play an essential role in the gel layer and biofilm development on membrane although tep were widely studied in the marine system in the 20th century they were neglected in the water treatment processes in 2005 berman and other marine biologists first proposed that tep might play a key role in the growth and development of biofilm berman and holenberg 2005 in 2007 berman and other scholars again emphasized the importance of tep in water and considered it as a potentially significant substance in the formation of biofilm berman and passow 2007 berman was the first to introduce and reveal the role of tep to the water treatment systems by bridging over the gap of oceanography and engineering bar zeev et al further demonstrated the importance of protobiofilm tep colonized by microorganism and tep in biofilm formation by comparing the initial stages of biofilm development on solid surface with filtered unfiltered seawater which strongly confirmed the significance of tep in biofilm formation bar zeev et al 2012 in 2015 bar zeev et al combined environmental science with water treatment engineering to re emphasize the role of tep in membrane fouling bar zeev et al 2015 fig 2 shows the trend of the tep related fouling publications and the citations of these articles the attention paid on tep fouling increased from 2005 reached the maximum at year 2016 and then decreased in recent 3 years however the citations of these tep related fouling papers increased steadily these trends indicate that some researcher have been interested in tep fouling while the role of tep in membrane fouling is contentious further analysis of these papers reveals that 44 of them believe that membrane fouling is related with the tep in feed water but the exact effect of tep on fouling is not sure fig 3 meanwhile there are 33 studies confirm that tep promote the development of membrane fouling especially biofouling in addition 3 studies think the effect of tep on fouling is overestimated and tep don t play a significant role in membrane fouling according to the properties of tep they may play a role in membrane fouling including following aspects 3 1 formation of tep associated gel layer on membrane surface polysaccharides largely contribute to the gel layer formation on membrane surface due to their long molecule chains and gelling property meng et al 2017 tep are a class of particulate polysaccharides which are floating gel like substances with three dimensional polymer networks what s more important tep usually possess high viscosity the viscosity of tep is 2 4 orders of magnitude higher than that of phytoplankton or mineral particles dam 2004 passow 2002b the high viscosity of tep leads to the easy attachment of tep on membrane surface and then the fast gel layer development in addition the high viscosity results with the difficulty in removal of tep from membrane system in natural water environments tep mainly form from dissolved organic carbon doc which is an important pathway for doc to transfer into particulate organic carbon poc verdugo et al 2004 thus the tep attachment efficiently improves the efficiency of gel layer formation on membrane so far ample evidences have been accumulated on the significance of tep in gel layer formation and tep is now considered an important factor affecting membrane fouling bar zeev et al 2015 wang et al 2020 3 2 tep a carrier of microorganisms towards membrane surface tep have a three dimensional structure with a large specific surface area which provides an excellent habitat for microorganism to settle down besides tep exhibit a negative charge to adsorb other organic molecules and trace metals supplying abundant nutrients for the growth of microorganism although the concentration of tep in seawater or fresh water is usually lower than 1000 μg xep l 1 passow 2002b they can still serve as a nutrient source for microbial growth provide a place for microbial growth and become a hot spot for microbial activity the tep have 1 solid content while the doc in seawater is only about 1 mg l indicating that for bacteria tep have 104 more bacterial substrate than bulk seawater verdugo 2012 consequently microorganism tend to inhabit tep it has been shown that about 0 5 25 of all bacteria present in seawater and freshwater are attached onto tep passow 2002b berman and parparova 2010 based on the constituents of the bacterial cell wall and polysaccharide extracellular coating the physicochemical interactions driving bacterial attachment to tep are likely to be the same as those that result in tep self assembly bar zeev et al 2009 bayles 2007 in addition bacteria can attach to the surface of tep and bacterial cells can be treated as negatively charged hydrophobic particles during the process of bacterial surface interaction the extended derjaguin landau verwey overbeek xdlvo theory which describes the interaction between particles that is the free energy of adhesion of a colloidal particle to an extended solid surface as the sum of van der waals and electrostatic double layer interactions can be used to calculate the interaction between bacteria cells and tep surfaces bar zeev et al 2009 hermansson 1999 there is enough evidences showing that tep colonize tep while the direct data showing the microorganism s growth using tep as carbon source for example the growth chart of microorganism is deficient more work should be involved to explain the metabolism of microorganism inhabiting tep to provide fundamental understanding as a consequence tep are usually highly colonized by microorganism in natural water environments serving as the hot spot passow 2002b the colonized tep share some similar properties with biofilm named as protobiofilm bar zeev et al 2012 with the high viscosity it s much easier for protobiofilm to attach to and simultaneously bring bacteria to the membrane which is more efficient than single cell adhesion of bacteria besides the rich nutrient of protobiofilm provides a good start up supply for bacteria to settle down and then successfully grow up on membrane consequently the tep protobiofilm accelerate the formation of biofilm on the membrane i e biofouling 3 3 trapping of deformable tep by membrane pores since tep are deformable they can pass through membrane pores smaller than their particle size under pressure it has been experimentally demonstrated that although the particle size of tep is larger than the average microfiltration mf or ultrafiltration uf membrane pore size tep can be measured in both filtrate side of them bar zeev et al 2015 the reason is that tep can be bent broken and dispersed through the pores of mf and uf and then reassembled in the filtrate to form a large sized network before reaching the ro membrane module although there is still no clear direct evidence a possible mechanism for the prevalence of tep in uf and mf filtrates has been proposed which is based on hydrogel formation paradigms bar zeev et al 2015 there are a range of pore sizes of membranes employed in the membrane pretreatment system and these systems need to be operated at different pressures at the low pressure bacterial cells are less likely to rupture but the polysaccharide cell envelope may fall off the hydrogel polymer i e tep formed by the shedding of the polysaccharide cell envelope can be lysed into tep precursors through the pores of the membrane upon passage the accumulation of these tep precursors within the pore structure of the membrane causes pore clogging of the membrane resulting in irreversible membrane fouling at the same time some of the tep precursors that have passed through the membrane can repolymerize in the filtrate to form larger polyelectrolytes colloidal nanogels and small tep bar zeev et al 2015 these are major issues about tep in the membrane systems that still need to be explored in future study 3 4 evidence of tep associated fouling in various membrane systems as shown in table 1 most of tep related fouling studies focus on uf and ro processes which are commonly employed in seawater desalination generally most of these studies concluded that tep influenced membrane fouling via contributing to gel layer formation and biofouling development bar zeev et al 2009 2012 berman et al 2011 however the specific role of tep in membrane fouling changes from case to case kennedy et al 2009 found that tep caused irreversible fouling while marbelia et al 2016 dedicated that tep probably influenced the cake layer resistance it is worth noting that the uf which is used as pre treatment for ro unit can t remove all tep in feed water especially the c tep as shown in fig 4 however most of tep in water environments are colloidal tep c tep or called tep precursors with size smaller than 0 4 μm instead of the first discovered particulate tep p tep villacorte et al 2010b addition of coagulant may increase the rejection rates of tep villacorte et al 2009a li et al 2016a consequently a certain amount of tep reaches ro membrane and leads to the serious membrane fouling villacorte et al 2010b all ro units showed 100 removal of tep without question but suffer from fouling problems besides the same uf membrane showed different removal rates for tep villacorte et al 2009a li et al 2016a it seems like that the rejection rates of tep by uf depend on the properties of tep or the sources of tep since evidence has shown that tep deriving at different concentrations of sodium ion possess distinct stickiness meng and liu 2016 it can be deducted that tep in various water environments have different fouling propensities this is probably another main reason leading to the controversy regarding the usage of tep as a fouling indicator for the membrane bioreactor mbr most studies suggest that among the various fouling factors tep can work as a new membrane fouling indicator borea et al 2017 de la torre et al 2008 wu et al 2012 2013b there are few studies focusing on the tep related fouling in the microfiltration mf and forward osmosis fo filtration the available studies reveal that tep tend to attach to membrane surface and thus contribute to the fouling layer development on membrane meng and liu 2013 meng et al 2018 valladares linares et al 2012 2013 however in some cases the fouling layer formed by tep worked as a pre filter on mf membrane surface which in turn mitigated membrane fouling by preventing the membrane from serious pore blocking meng and liu 2013 meng et al 2018 therefore the role of tep in membrane fouling is still controversial nevertheless according to the available studies tep definitely pose a critical impact on membrane fouling what s more important many studies suggest that most of tep are c tep which can recombine to form tep again especially at the presence of divalent cations accordingly it s of great importance to investigate the effect of metal ions on the formation of tep and the life cycle of tep in the integrated membrane system 4 cation mediated tep formation towards membrane fouling there are many studies focusing on the impact of cations on organic foulants including polysaccharide protein and humic acid most of previous studies concluded that cations such as ca2 promoted membrane fouling via bridging between foulant and membrane however some recent studies have shown that cations changed the morphology of foulant via bridging between foulant molecules chen et al 2020 meng et al 2015 teng et al 2020 wang et al 2020 zhang et al 2017 which definitely influences membrane fouling and has been neglected tep is the result of crosslinking of polysaccharide foulant and tep level reveals the extent of crosslinking it s of great importance to pay attention to the effect of cation on tep formation in addition recent studies have pointed out that the extracellular polymeric substances eps form hydrogels at the presence of alkaline earth and transition metal ions felz et al 2020 and protein can form coomassie stainable particles csp thornton 2018 these findings further propose that a certain amount of organic foulants in membrane system probably form particles via crosslinking instead of being single molecule the cation mediated tep formation ca be used as a model to understand the effects of metal ions on the crosslinking of organic foulants as discussed above evidences have proved that most of tep form from precursor materials via an abiotic pathway which is indeed promoted or stabilized by metal ions such as calcium ion tep disintegrate rapidly with addition of ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid edta a chelating agent of calcium ion revealing the importance of calcium ion in maintaining the structural integrity of tep alldredge et al 1993 valladares linares et al 2013 in the feed water to membrane systems there are abundant polysaccharide foulants and inorganic cations including calcium ion magnesium ion and other ions as shown in fig 5 it s reasonable to consider that these polysaccharide foulants don t exist as single molecules but interact with each other to form larger three dimensional networks especially at the presence of metal ions besides the turbulence caused by bubbles or shear force in the membrane system would promotes the formation of aggregation of polysaccharides passow 2000 in spite of the controversy associated with the role of tep in membrane fouling it should be noticed that the aggregation of polysaccharide foulants greatly affects membrane fouling whether or not the aggregation is called tep therefore it is of primary interest for researchers to investigate the mechanism of molecular interaction among polysaccharide foulants tep measurement in turn can work as an indicator of the aggregation extent of polysaccharide foulants in feed water the effect of various metal ions on the crosslinking of polysaccharides is different significantly depending on the species and valence of these ions even if a certain metal ion plays different roles at different situations in the aggregation of polysaccharides for example generally it is found that the calcium ion can promote the formation of tep meng et al 2015 but it also promotes the formation and deposition of marine snow which turned out to reduce the tep concentration passow 2002b besides it s found that the tep formed at a high na ca2 ratio was softer and sticker than that formed at a low na ca2 ratio meng and liu 2016 in addition high divalent cation concentration will reduce the viscosity of tep thereby affecting its coagulation effect resulting in reduced tep concentration meng et al 2015 the influences of inorganic ions on the quantity and quality of tep are intricate therefore more efforts need to be devoted into explore the mechanism of inorganic ions in the intermolecular interactions of polysaccharide foulants in view of this this review elucidates the definition formation determination method influence on membrane fouling of tep and then discusses the effect of inorganic ions on tep formation so as to offer deep insights into polysaccharide fouling the intermolecular interaction of polysaccharides determines the size of polysaccharide aggregation which further significantly influences the filtration process meng et al 2018 not the molecular size of organic foulants but the effective size of organic aggregates does matter during membrane filtration however in the past we paid insufficient attention to the interaction between polysaccharide molecules and did not investigate the actual morphology of polysaccharide foulants and other organic foulants although some researchers in polymer field have looked into the effects of inorganic ions on polysaccharide interactions but the systems they investigated contained much higher concentrations of polysaccharide and not suitable for water treatment studies the rules of polysaccharides interaction at high level can t directly be applied in low concentration systems more importantly we still know very little about the effects of species and valences of inorganic ions on the crosslinking of polysaccharides the foulant morphology shaped by the interaction of polysaccharides is of great significance in the study of membrane fouling and the interaction is deeply affected by inorganic ions therefore this review summarizes the effects of several different valence states of inorganic ions on polysaccharide interaction 4 1 monovalent cations the monovalent cations such as the sodium ion and potassium ion are ubiquitous in water environments and also affect the aggregation of polysaccharide it has been found that increasing the sodium ion concentration at a fixed calcium ion level results in a significant decrease in tep formation meng and liu 2016 this reducing effect of sodium ion on the interaction of polysaccharides is attributed to the competition between calcium ion and sodium ion the binding sites on the polysaccharide molecules are negatively charged and positive calcium ion and sodium ion would compete for these binding sites increasing the sodium ion concentration results with the decrease of the calcium ion interaction with polysaccharides besides the binding affinities of calcium ion to different polysaccharides vary from one to another for example increasing the sodium ion concentration can result in a decrease or even disappearance of the production of tep from the mg blocks and mm blocks of alginate while the tep formed from gg blocks still can be detected meng and liu 2016 consequently monovalent cation shows an adverse influence on the aggregation of polysaccharide foulants i e tep formation 4 2 divalent cations the crosslinking of polysaccharide includes intramolecular and intermolecular interaction on one hand the polysaccharide foulants usually contain long chains which would interact intramolecularly meng et al 2017 on the other hand polysaccharide chain would interact with another molecule chain which is more important in gel layer formation verdugo 2012 the presence of divalent cation largely promotes the cross linking of polysaccharide chains including both intermolecular and intramolecular interactions jimenez et al 2012 in the biofilm it has been found that divalent cations bridges negatively charge functional groups within the bacterial eps which helps to aggregate and stabilize the matrix of biopolymer and microbes kim and jang 2006 in a word the presence of bivalent cation plays an important role in membrane fouling process thus it is indispensable to understand its function and mechanism the most representative divalent inorganic ions are calcium and magnesium ions which are the most common and abundant cations in water environments calcium ion is capable of specifically binding to the carboxyl function of the polysaccharide to form a bridge between adjacent molecules increasing their aggregation i e egg box model which has been extensively documented in literature chen et al 2018 gotoh et al 2004a b grant et al 1973 you et al 2020 however the egg box model can t explain all binding modes between divalent cations and polysaccharides the application of this model is indeed limited taking alginate which is widely employed as model foulant as an example there are three types of blocks in the alginate chain and they showed totally different binding affinities to calcium ions although all of them possessed carboxyl groups lin et al 2010 meng et al 2015 the binding affinity between calcium ion and polysaccharides depends on not only the functional groups such as carboxyl groups and sulfated groups but also the chain structure of polysaccharides it can be understood that the more complex of the chain of polysaccharide the less opportunity for the cations to bind to it then leading to the reduction in tep formation the steric configuration of polysaccharide molecules has a certain influence on the binding ability to divalent cations thus resulting with different tep formation whether functional groups or spatial configuration has a greater influence on tep formation needs to be further explored as consequence of this finding more effort should be devoted to explore the binding affinity between calcium ion and various polysaccharides which will certainly offer deep insights into the fouling mechanism of polysaccharides similar to calcium ion magnesium ion content in water is relatively higher than other divalent cations however very few studies focused on the effect of magnesium ion on membrane fouling not to mention the role of magnesium ion in the crosslinking of polysaccharide foulants magnesium ion has the smallest ionic radius in all cations and thus has a higher charge density maguire and cowan 2002 ionized magnesium usually coordinates with 6 7 water molecules occurring in a typical octahedral conformation which makes the water exchange is much slower as compared to other metal ions wolf and cittadini 2003 consequently the magnesium ion is much bigger and more stable than calcium ion in water environments the establishment of binding between cation and polysaccharide includes two steps releasing of structured water molecules from the hydrated polysaccharide molecule and ion shell and binding is then established it s more difficult for magnesium than calcium ion to remove the water in the hydration shell accordingly different from the strong site specific ionic bonds of calcium ion formed with polysaccharides the interactions between mg2 and alginate is supposed to be affinity driven wang et al 2020 nevertheless magnesium ion has been proved to increase the cross linking between polysaccharide molecules enhance tep formation and eventually lead to the formation of gel layer causing membrane fouling wang et al 2020 the abundance of magnesium ion in water environments seawater contains 50 mm highlights a pressing need for insight into its binding mechanism with various polysaccharide foulants in summary divalent cations deeply affected the crosslinking of polysaccharide foulant which possibly determines the development of membrane fouling during filtration process as shown in fig 6 since the interaction mechanism varies from one to another it s of great importance to investigate the origin of cation polysaccharide interaction 4 3 trivalent cations the iron and aluminum coagulants are commonly used in the coagulation or flocculation processes in the water treatment system as a result residual cations would participate in the membrane fouling besides natural water environments also contain iron ions the interaction between polysaccharide foulants and these trivalent cations is also significant in understanding the membrane fouling problem trivalent cations are expected to be involved in the gelation im et al 2019 flocculation ma et al 2015 and precipitation processes associated with organic substances teng et al 2020 these processes have distinguished impacts on membrane fouling with corresponding to different interaction mechanisms what s more important these processes may occur simultaneously which leads to a virtually intricate situation however it should be noted that all these processes depend on the interaction between trivalent cations and the organic foulants as long as the exact nature of the interaction mechanism between trivalent cations and organic foulants is explained the related fouling problem can be better understood a similar increasing effect on the interaction of polysaccharides with that of the divalent cation is observed increasing iron ion content converted the colloidal tep into granular tep li et al 2016a however the binding affinities of divalent and trivalent cations to polysaccharides are extremely different it has been demonstrated that the limited capacity of alginate for calcium ions is about 8 carboxyl groups for one calcium ion while it s about 7 carboxyl groups for one aluminum ion gregor et al 1996 similar to the monovalent cation the interaction between the trivalent cation and the polysaccharide is not strong and the formation of tep decreases due to the competition with the divalent cation in the literature there is very few studies focusing on the influence of trivalent cations on polysaccharides interaction as well as the tep formation revealing an obvious lack of mechanistic insights into it 5 conclusions transparent exopolymer particles tep as gel like particulate acidic polysaccharide have been commonly found in feed water to membrane systems thus leading to increasing interest in tep associated membrane fouling the main implications of this review are as follows 1 the determination methods of tep are crucial in defining tep and providing comparable results the separation staining method with suitable adjustments is recommended because it essentially differing tep from other dissolved organic substances 2 the contributions of tep made to membrane fouling include the formation of tep associated gel layer on membrane surface carrying microorganisms to membrane via protobiofilm and escaping of deformable tep from pretreatment units 3 most of tep in the water environments are colloidal tep and the pretreatments including uf can t completely reject tep thus a certain amount of tep reach ro unit causing fouling 4 the formation of tep was largely related to cations in water environments which indeed determined the cross linking degree of precursor materials e g polysaccharides via intermolecular interactions the binding between cations ions e g monovalent divalent and trivalent cations and polysaccharide not only depends on the functional groups of polysaccharide but also its spatial configuration 5 these in turn suggest that the formation property and ultimate fouling potential of tep would be closely related to the type and concentration of cations in water which well explains the controversial reports on tep associated fouling in the literature 6 tep is an ignored determinant of membrane fouling which has not yet been seriously addressed in the design and operation of membrane systems for water and wastewater treatment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

17841,transparent exopolymer particles tep as gel like particulate acidic polysaccharide have been commonly found in marine surface water and wastewater currently increasing interest has been devoted to tep associated membrane fouling in different membrane systems for water and wastewater treatment thus this review attempts to provide a holistic view and critical analysis with regard to the definition formation detection and properties of tep which could ultimately determine its fouling potential it appears that there is not a common consensus on the actual role of tep in membrane fouling development due to the subjective definition and highly debatable detection method of tep it was clearly demonstrated in this review that the formation of tep was largely related to cations in water and wastewater which indeed determined the cross linking degree of precursor materials e g polysaccharides via intermolecular interactions and subsequently the quantity of tep formed the binding between cations ions e g monovalent divalent and trivalent cations and polysaccharide not only depends on the functional groups of polysaccharide but also its spatial configuration these in turn suggest that the formation property and ultimate fouling potential of tep would be closely related to the type and concentration of cations while well explaining the controversial reports on tep associated fouling in the literature in addition the fouling mechanisms of tep are also elucidated with details in this review including i the formation of tep associated gel layer on membrane surface ii carrying microorganisms to membrane surface via protobiofilm and iii trapping of deformable tep in membrane pores consequently it is apparent that tep is an ignored determinant of membrane fouling which has not yet been seriously addressed in the design and operation of membrane systems for water and wastewater treatment graphical abstract image 1 keywords transparent exopolymer particles membrane fouling common cations interaction of polysaccharide 1 introduction membrane technology has been widely used for water and wastewater treatment with membrane fouling being a major operational obstacle meng et al 2019a b shannon et al 2008 polysaccharide substance has been shown to play a critical role in the development of both organic fouling and biofouling of membrane due to its long molecule chain and gelling property drews 2010 meng et al 2017 rosenberger et al 2006 recently some studies have showed that polysaccharide could form three dimensional networks known as transparent exopolymer particles tep which may likely be related to fouling development in various membrane systems bar zeev et al 2015 berman et al 2011 discart et al 2013 meng et al 2013 however the fouling mechanism associated with tep still remains unclear tep has been widely detected in marine and fresh water environments with high abundance during seasonal algal blooms passow 2002a the unique characteristics of tep include high viscosity easy colonization by microorganism deformable structure etc bar zeev et al 2015 engel 2000 mopper et al 1995 passow and alldredge 1994 passow 2002b as such increasing attention has been recently dedicated to the fouling potential of tep in membrane systems for water and wastewater treatment it should be noted that there is active debate on the analytical methods of tep currently available in the literature the microscopic enumeration method only determines the abundance of tep accompanied with intensive labour and underestimation of the tep number passow and alldredge 1994 while the spectrophotometric method is divergent due to the sensitivity of alcian blue staining and the challenge in calibration passow and alldredge 1995 meng et al 2013 as the result reported tep concentrations quantified by different method appear to be hardly comparable this in turn makes tep related fouling studies uncertain and arguable obviously there is an urgent need to provide a thorough and systematic review of role of tep in membrane fouling development therefore this review aims to provide a holistic view and critical analysis with regard to the definition formation detection and properties of tep which could ultimately determine its fouling potential 2 definition formation and determination of tep 2 1 definition of tep tep was firstly found by alldredge et al 1993 when they stained the seawater samples with alcian blue which is specific for negatively charged polysaccharides in the past biological activities such as metabolism of bacteria were considered as necessary conditions in the conversion of dissolved organic matter dom to particulate organic matter pom the discovery of tep reveals that it s possible to convert dom to pom via an abiotic transformation tep can form from dom under abiotic action passow 2002b tep were operationally defined as particles retained by 0 4 μm track etched polycarbonate filters and stainable with alcian blue passow and alldredge 1994 1995 however there are some defects lying in the above determination method of tep thus more detection methods has been developed which in deed re defined tep currently tep are commonly known as clear gel like polysaccharides 2 2 formation mechanism of tep there are two pathways of the tep formation from dom in the natural water environments meng et al 2013 some plankton and bacteria directly produce tep which is mainly formed by the loss of polysaccharide fiber material immobilized on the cell surface tep can directly form from the precursor materials released by plankton in an abiotic pathway such as coagulation gelation and annealing the abiotic aggregation of precursor material is the main pathway for tep formation bar zeev et al 2015 passow 2012 wurl et al 2011 and this process is greatly promoted by cations passow 2002b verdugo 2012 for example the well known bridging ion calcium ions however there are many types of cations in the natural water environments such as the magnesium ion and the abundant monovalent cations which are rarely evaluated in the formation of tep in addition trivalent cations are often added before the membrane unit in the water treatment systems which poses a need to investigate the effect of trivalent cations on tep formation and fouling accordingly this article critically reviews the nature of tep in membrane fouling and the intricate relationships between tep and various cations in membrane systems before that the tep measurement methods must be introduced since the determination methods of tep not only detect the level of tep but also define what tep are 2 3 determination of tep the determination of tep in water samples is accomplished by alcian blue staining alcian blue selectively stains acidic polysaccharides by ionic binding to carboxyl and sulfated groups making tep visible and capable of quantification ramus 1977 this dye is the key factor to identify tep and has been employed in all tep assays except for the magic isolation method mari and dam 2004 however particles measured by this method indeed are not the originally defined tep and rare studies use it thus this method is not discussed in this review any more the alcian blue staining is subject to the characteristics of the water samples including the ph ionic strength and carbon and nitrogen content of tep anja and uta 2001 unfortunately the exact interaction mechanism between the alcian blue and a specific substrate is still not well known today although it has been widely used in medical and biological studies consequently researchers are still working on the optimation of the tep determination methods such as updating the calibration for tep measurement bittar et al 2018 what should be noticed is that discrepancy may occur when comparing tep related results from studies using different determination methods in the beginning tep were operationally defined as transparent particles that can be retained by 0 4 μm filters and are stainable with alcian blue alldredge et al 1993 with the increasing attention attracted by tep more and more determination methods have been developed and the definition of tep indeed has changed according to the location where the binding between tep and alcian blue happens the tep determination methods can be classified into two categories as separation staining method and direct staining method as shown in fig 1 the most popular method was the spectrophotometric method proposed by passow and alldredge 1995 although some changes have been introduced including using filters with smaller pore size li et al 2016a sim et al 2019 villacorte et al 2009a and modifications of the calibration process bittar et al 2018 villacorte et al 2009b this method and its updates share the same procedure that tep are first separated by filters and then stained by alcian blue on filters with this method tep are first identified by their size which is consistent with the original definition what s more important the staining ability and selectivity of alcian blue largely depends on the ph and ionic strength of the solution villacorte et al 2015a isolating tep from samples with filter can minimize the measurement artefacts due to the complicated chemical compositions of water samples the application of alcian blue staining to measure acid polysaccharides including tep in brackish and saline waters is mainly limited by the low stability of the dye and its sensitivity to water salinity these problems can be minimized by pre filtering the alcian blue solution through a 0 05 μm membrane and filtering the ultrapure water through a tep gel to rinse off the inorganic ions prior to alcian blue staining villacorte et al 2015a these methods can provide a semi quantitative evaluation of the tep level in water samples employing xanthan gum as standard substance until now these filtration staining methods are still the most extensively used methods in quantifying tep differently the other methods measure the tep by adding alcian blue into the water samples directly then the precipitates produced by tep and alcian blue interaction are separated by centrifugation arruda fatibello et al 2004 thornton et al 2007 or filtration villacorte et al 2015a the unreacted alcian blue in water is subsequently measured using a spectrophotometric method the difference between the total alcian blue added to the sample and the alcian blue left represents the amount of alcian blue reacted tep in the sample some pretreatments are employed according to the properties of water sample such as filtration with 70 μm nylon mesh arruda fatibello et al 2004 concentration of tep sample villacorte et al 2015a and dialyzing the samples with dialysis tubing thornton et al 2007 these methods don t separate tep from bulk solution and the tep measured indeed are not the tep first defined by alldredge et al 1993 tep differ from other dissolved organic substances in that they have large size which is characterized by filter separation it s reasonable to use filters with smaller pore size than 0 45 μm to look into the size distribution of tep and to determine the colloidal tep which can resemble to form tep under certain conditions however without filter separation it s difficult to define what have been measured in the tep tests in addition there may be more defects and inconsistencies lying in the tep results determined by these methods due to the fact that staining ability of alcian blue is highly subject to the chemical conditions of the sample nevertheless these methods still provide options when relevant information is needed 2 4 present controversy and challenges forward it s significant to choose a suitable method for tep determination according to the sample condition and objectives of study one of the main arguments of tep is the accuracy of tep analyses and thus leading to doubts regarding the usage of tep as a fouling indicator alcian blue staining is the key factor in defining tep alcian blue is a sensitive dye which stains not only tep but other substances in water samples besides the staining ability of alcian blue largely depends on the chemical condition of the place where staining happens accordingly based on our knowledge and experience we recommend the separation staining method for tep determination rather than the methods which directly add alcian blue into water samples separation staining method isolates tep first with chosen pore size and appropriate treatments can be performed before alcian blue addition to remove salinity such as ultra pure water rinsing these steps provide a controllable condition for tep staining with alcian blue thereby to create more reliable results although there are still defects in the tep determination methods the tep measurement still can work as an indicator of the aggregation extent of polysaccharide substances in water environments 3 tep an ignored ghost of membrane fouling nowadays the global demand for water is continuously increasing membrane technology has been the most promising technique for water and wastewater treatment while membrane fouling still remains as the biggest obstacle to the successful operation of membrane system elimelech and phillip 2011 recently more and more studies have shown that gel layer in spite of its high porosity and thinness shows remarkably high filtration resistance which is nearly one hundred times higher than that contributed by cake layer chen et al 2016 besides biofilm development on membrane is also the main reason and the most difficult fouling problem due to the physical and chemical properties of tep tep may play an essential role in the gel layer and biofilm development on membrane although tep were widely studied in the marine system in the 20th century they were neglected in the water treatment processes in 2005 berman and other marine biologists first proposed that tep might play a key role in the growth and development of biofilm berman and holenberg 2005 in 2007 berman and other scholars again emphasized the importance of tep in water and considered it as a potentially significant substance in the formation of biofilm berman and passow 2007 berman was the first to introduce and reveal the role of tep to the water treatment systems by bridging over the gap of oceanography and engineering bar zeev et al further demonstrated the importance of protobiofilm tep colonized by microorganism and tep in biofilm formation by comparing the initial stages of biofilm development on solid surface with filtered unfiltered seawater which strongly confirmed the significance of tep in biofilm formation bar zeev et al 2012 in 2015 bar zeev et al combined environmental science with water treatment engineering to re emphasize the role of tep in membrane fouling bar zeev et al 2015 fig 2 shows the trend of the tep related fouling publications and the citations of these articles the attention paid on tep fouling increased from 2005 reached the maximum at year 2016 and then decreased in recent 3 years however the citations of these tep related fouling papers increased steadily these trends indicate that some researcher have been interested in tep fouling while the role of tep in membrane fouling is contentious further analysis of these papers reveals that 44 of them believe that membrane fouling is related with the tep in feed water but the exact effect of tep on fouling is not sure fig 3 meanwhile there are 33 studies confirm that tep promote the development of membrane fouling especially biofouling in addition 3 studies think the effect of tep on fouling is overestimated and tep don t play a significant role in membrane fouling according to the properties of tep they may play a role in membrane fouling including following aspects 3 1 formation of tep associated gel layer on membrane surface polysaccharides largely contribute to the gel layer formation on membrane surface due to their long molecule chains and gelling property meng et al 2017 tep are a class of particulate polysaccharides which are floating gel like substances with three dimensional polymer networks what s more important tep usually possess high viscosity the viscosity of tep is 2 4 orders of magnitude higher than that of phytoplankton or mineral particles dam 2004 passow 2002b the high viscosity of tep leads to the easy attachment of tep on membrane surface and then the fast gel layer development in addition the high viscosity results with the difficulty in removal of tep from membrane system in natural water environments tep mainly form from dissolved organic carbon doc which is an important pathway for doc to transfer into particulate organic carbon poc verdugo et al 2004 thus the tep attachment efficiently improves the efficiency of gel layer formation on membrane so far ample evidences have been accumulated on the significance of tep in gel layer formation and tep is now considered an important factor affecting membrane fouling bar zeev et al 2015 wang et al 2020 3 2 tep a carrier of microorganisms towards membrane surface tep have a three dimensional structure with a large specific surface area which provides an excellent habitat for microorganism to settle down besides tep exhibit a negative charge to adsorb other organic molecules and trace metals supplying abundant nutrients for the growth of microorganism although the concentration of tep in seawater or fresh water is usually lower than 1000 μg xep l 1 passow 2002b they can still serve as a nutrient source for microbial growth provide a place for microbial growth and become a hot spot for microbial activity the tep have 1 solid content while the doc in seawater is only about 1 mg l indicating that for bacteria tep have 104 more bacterial substrate than bulk seawater verdugo 2012 consequently microorganism tend to inhabit tep it has been shown that about 0 5 25 of all bacteria present in seawater and freshwater are attached onto tep passow 2002b berman and parparova 2010 based on the constituents of the bacterial cell wall and polysaccharide extracellular coating the physicochemical interactions driving bacterial attachment to tep are likely to be the same as those that result in tep self assembly bar zeev et al 2009 bayles 2007 in addition bacteria can attach to the surface of tep and bacterial cells can be treated as negatively charged hydrophobic particles during the process of bacterial surface interaction the extended derjaguin landau verwey overbeek xdlvo theory which describes the interaction between particles that is the free energy of adhesion of a colloidal particle to an extended solid surface as the sum of van der waals and electrostatic double layer interactions can be used to calculate the interaction between bacteria cells and tep surfaces bar zeev et al 2009 hermansson 1999 there is enough evidences showing that tep colonize tep while the direct data showing the microorganism s growth using tep as carbon source for example the growth chart of microorganism is deficient more work should be involved to explain the metabolism of microorganism inhabiting tep to provide fundamental understanding as a consequence tep are usually highly colonized by microorganism in natural water environments serving as the hot spot passow 2002b the colonized tep share some similar properties with biofilm named as protobiofilm bar zeev et al 2012 with the high viscosity it s much easier for protobiofilm to attach to and simultaneously bring bacteria to the membrane which is more efficient than single cell adhesion of bacteria besides the rich nutrient of protobiofilm provides a good start up supply for bacteria to settle down and then successfully grow up on membrane consequently the tep protobiofilm accelerate the formation of biofilm on the membrane i e biofouling 3 3 trapping of deformable tep by membrane pores since tep are deformable they can pass through membrane pores smaller than their particle size under pressure it has been experimentally demonstrated that although the particle size of tep is larger than the average microfiltration mf or ultrafiltration uf membrane pore size tep can be measured in both filtrate side of them bar zeev et al 2015 the reason is that tep can be bent broken and dispersed through the pores of mf and uf and then reassembled in the filtrate to form a large sized network before reaching the ro membrane module although there is still no clear direct evidence a possible mechanism for the prevalence of tep in uf and mf filtrates has been proposed which is based on hydrogel formation paradigms bar zeev et al 2015 there are a range of pore sizes of membranes employed in the membrane pretreatment system and these systems need to be operated at different pressures at the low pressure bacterial cells are less likely to rupture but the polysaccharide cell envelope may fall off the hydrogel polymer i e tep formed by the shedding of the polysaccharide cell envelope can be lysed into tep precursors through the pores of the membrane upon passage the accumulation of these tep precursors within the pore structure of the membrane causes pore clogging of the membrane resulting in irreversible membrane fouling at the same time some of the tep precursors that have passed through the membrane can repolymerize in the filtrate to form larger polyelectrolytes colloidal nanogels and small tep bar zeev et al 2015 these are major issues about tep in the membrane systems that still need to be explored in future study 3 4 evidence of tep associated fouling in various membrane systems as shown in table 1 most of tep related fouling studies focus on uf and ro processes which are commonly employed in seawater desalination generally most of these studies concluded that tep influenced membrane fouling via contributing to gel layer formation and biofouling development bar zeev et al 2009 2012 berman et al 2011 however the specific role of tep in membrane fouling changes from case to case kennedy et al 2009 found that tep caused irreversible fouling while marbelia et al 2016 dedicated that tep probably influenced the cake layer resistance it is worth noting that the uf which is used as pre treatment for ro unit can t remove all tep in feed water especially the c tep as shown in fig 4 however most of tep in water environments are colloidal tep c tep or called tep precursors with size smaller than 0 4 μm instead of the first discovered particulate tep p tep villacorte et al 2010b addition of coagulant may increase the rejection rates of tep villacorte et al 2009a li et al 2016a consequently a certain amount of tep reaches ro membrane and leads to the serious membrane fouling villacorte et al 2010b all ro units showed 100 removal of tep without question but suffer from fouling problems besides the same uf membrane showed different removal rates for tep villacorte et al 2009a li et al 2016a it seems like that the rejection rates of tep by uf depend on the properties of tep or the sources of tep since evidence has shown that tep deriving at different concentrations of sodium ion possess distinct stickiness meng and liu 2016 it can be deducted that tep in various water environments have different fouling propensities this is probably another main reason leading to the controversy regarding the usage of tep as a fouling indicator for the membrane bioreactor mbr most studies suggest that among the various fouling factors tep can work as a new membrane fouling indicator borea et al 2017 de la torre et al 2008 wu et al 2012 2013b there are few studies focusing on the tep related fouling in the microfiltration mf and forward osmosis fo filtration the available studies reveal that tep tend to attach to membrane surface and thus contribute to the fouling layer development on membrane meng and liu 2013 meng et al 2018 valladares linares et al 2012 2013 however in some cases the fouling layer formed by tep worked as a pre filter on mf membrane surface which in turn mitigated membrane fouling by preventing the membrane from serious pore blocking meng and liu 2013 meng et al 2018 therefore the role of tep in membrane fouling is still controversial nevertheless according to the available studies tep definitely pose a critical impact on membrane fouling what s more important many studies suggest that most of tep are c tep which can recombine to form tep again especially at the presence of divalent cations accordingly it s of great importance to investigate the effect of metal ions on the formation of tep and the life cycle of tep in the integrated membrane system 4 cation mediated tep formation towards membrane fouling there are many studies focusing on the impact of cations on organic foulants including polysaccharide protein and humic acid most of previous studies concluded that cations such as ca2 promoted membrane fouling via bridging between foulant and membrane however some recent studies have shown that cations changed the morphology of foulant via bridging between foulant molecules chen et al 2020 meng et al 2015 teng et al 2020 wang et al 2020 zhang et al 2017 which definitely influences membrane fouling and has been neglected tep is the result of crosslinking of polysaccharide foulant and tep level reveals the extent of crosslinking it s of great importance to pay attention to the effect of cation on tep formation in addition recent studies have pointed out that the extracellular polymeric substances eps form hydrogels at the presence of alkaline earth and transition metal ions felz et al 2020 and protein can form coomassie stainable particles csp thornton 2018 these findings further propose that a certain amount of organic foulants in membrane system probably form particles via crosslinking instead of being single molecule the cation mediated tep formation ca be used as a model to understand the effects of metal ions on the crosslinking of organic foulants as discussed above evidences have proved that most of tep form from precursor materials via an abiotic pathway which is indeed promoted or stabilized by metal ions such as calcium ion tep disintegrate rapidly with addition of ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid edta a chelating agent of calcium ion revealing the importance of calcium ion in maintaining the structural integrity of tep alldredge et al 1993 valladares linares et al 2013 in the feed water to membrane systems there are abundant polysaccharide foulants and inorganic cations including calcium ion magnesium ion and other ions as shown in fig 5 it s reasonable to consider that these polysaccharide foulants don t exist as single molecules but interact with each other to form larger three dimensional networks especially at the presence of metal ions besides the turbulence caused by bubbles or shear force in the membrane system would promotes the formation of aggregation of polysaccharides passow 2000 in spite of the controversy associated with the role of tep in membrane fouling it should be noticed that the aggregation of polysaccharide foulants greatly affects membrane fouling whether or not the aggregation is called tep therefore it is of primary interest for researchers to investigate the mechanism of molecular interaction among polysaccharide foulants tep measurement in turn can work as an indicator of the aggregation extent of polysaccharide foulants in feed water the effect of various metal ions on the crosslinking of polysaccharides is different significantly depending on the species and valence of these ions even if a certain metal ion plays different roles at different situations in the aggregation of polysaccharides for example generally it is found that the calcium ion can promote the formation of tep meng et al 2015 but it also promotes the formation and deposition of marine snow which turned out to reduce the tep concentration passow 2002b besides it s found that the tep formed at a high na ca2 ratio was softer and sticker than that formed at a low na ca2 ratio meng and liu 2016 in addition high divalent cation concentration will reduce the viscosity of tep thereby affecting its coagulation effect resulting in reduced tep concentration meng et al 2015 the influences of inorganic ions on the quantity and quality of tep are intricate therefore more efforts need to be devoted into explore the mechanism of inorganic ions in the intermolecular interactions of polysaccharide foulants in view of this this review elucidates the definition formation determination method influence on membrane fouling of tep and then discusses the effect of inorganic ions on tep formation so as to offer deep insights into polysaccharide fouling the intermolecular interaction of polysaccharides determines the size of polysaccharide aggregation which further significantly influences the filtration process meng et al 2018 not the molecular size of organic foulants but the effective size of organic aggregates does matter during membrane filtration however in the past we paid insufficient attention to the interaction between polysaccharide molecules and did not investigate the actual morphology of polysaccharide foulants and other organic foulants although some researchers in polymer field have looked into the effects of inorganic ions on polysaccharide interactions but the systems they investigated contained much higher concentrations of polysaccharide and not suitable for water treatment studies the rules of polysaccharides interaction at high level can t directly be applied in low concentration systems more importantly we still know very little about the effects of species and valences of inorganic ions on the crosslinking of polysaccharides the foulant morphology shaped by the interaction of polysaccharides is of great significance in the study of membrane fouling and the interaction is deeply affected by inorganic ions therefore this review summarizes the effects of several different valence states of inorganic ions on polysaccharide interaction 4 1 monovalent cations the monovalent cations such as the sodium ion and potassium ion are ubiquitous in water environments and also affect the aggregation of polysaccharide it has been found that increasing the sodium ion concentration at a fixed calcium ion level results in a significant decrease in tep formation meng and liu 2016 this reducing effect of sodium ion on the interaction of polysaccharides is attributed to the competition between calcium ion and sodium ion the binding sites on the polysaccharide molecules are negatively charged and positive calcium ion and sodium ion would compete for these binding sites increasing the sodium ion concentration results with the decrease of the calcium ion interaction with polysaccharides besides the binding affinities of calcium ion to different polysaccharides vary from one to another for example increasing the sodium ion concentration can result in a decrease or even disappearance of the production of tep from the mg blocks and mm blocks of alginate while the tep formed from gg blocks still can be detected meng and liu 2016 consequently monovalent cation shows an adverse influence on the aggregation of polysaccharide foulants i e tep formation 4 2 divalent cations the crosslinking of polysaccharide includes intramolecular and intermolecular interaction on one hand the polysaccharide foulants usually contain long chains which would interact intramolecularly meng et al 2017 on the other hand polysaccharide chain would interact with another molecule chain which is more important in gel layer formation verdugo 2012 the presence of divalent cation largely promotes the cross linking of polysaccharide chains including both intermolecular and intramolecular interactions jimenez et al 2012 in the biofilm it has been found that divalent cations bridges negatively charge functional groups within the bacterial eps which helps to aggregate and stabilize the matrix of biopolymer and microbes kim and jang 2006 in a word the presence of bivalent cation plays an important role in membrane fouling process thus it is indispensable to understand its function and mechanism the most representative divalent inorganic ions are calcium and magnesium ions which are the most common and abundant cations in water environments calcium ion is capable of specifically binding to the carboxyl function of the polysaccharide to form a bridge between adjacent molecules increasing their aggregation i e egg box model which has been extensively documented in literature chen et al 2018 gotoh et al 2004a b grant et al 1973 you et al 2020 however the egg box model can t explain all binding modes between divalent cations and polysaccharides the application of this model is indeed limited taking alginate which is widely employed as model foulant as an example there are three types of blocks in the alginate chain and they showed totally different binding affinities to calcium ions although all of them possessed carboxyl groups lin et al 2010 meng et al 2015 the binding affinity between calcium ion and polysaccharides depends on not only the functional groups such as carboxyl groups and sulfated groups but also the chain structure of polysaccharides it can be understood that the more complex of the chain of polysaccharide the less opportunity for the cations to bind to it then leading to the reduction in tep formation the steric configuration of polysaccharide molecules has a certain influence on the binding ability to divalent cations thus resulting with different tep formation whether functional groups or spatial configuration has a greater influence on tep formation needs to be further explored as consequence of this finding more effort should be devoted to explore the binding affinity between calcium ion and various polysaccharides which will certainly offer deep insights into the fouling mechanism of polysaccharides similar to calcium ion magnesium ion content in water is relatively higher than other divalent cations however very few studies focused on the effect of magnesium ion on membrane fouling not to mention the role of magnesium ion in the crosslinking of polysaccharide foulants magnesium ion has the smallest ionic radius in all cations and thus has a higher charge density maguire and cowan 2002 ionized magnesium usually coordinates with 6 7 water molecules occurring in a typical octahedral conformation which makes the water exchange is much slower as compared to other metal ions wolf and cittadini 2003 consequently the magnesium ion is much bigger and more stable than calcium ion in water environments the establishment of binding between cation and polysaccharide includes two steps releasing of structured water molecules from the hydrated polysaccharide molecule and ion shell and binding is then established it s more difficult for magnesium than calcium ion to remove the water in the hydration shell accordingly different from the strong site specific ionic bonds of calcium ion formed with polysaccharides the interactions between mg2 and alginate is supposed to be affinity driven wang et al 2020 nevertheless magnesium ion has been proved to increase the cross linking between polysaccharide molecules enhance tep formation and eventually lead to the formation of gel layer causing membrane fouling wang et al 2020 the abundance of magnesium ion in water environments seawater contains 50 mm highlights a pressing need for insight into its binding mechanism with various polysaccharide foulants in summary divalent cations deeply affected the crosslinking of polysaccharide foulant which possibly determines the development of membrane fouling during filtration process as shown in fig 6 since the interaction mechanism varies from one to another it s of great importance to investigate the origin of cation polysaccharide interaction 4 3 trivalent cations the iron and aluminum coagulants are commonly used in the coagulation or flocculation processes in the water treatment system as a result residual cations would participate in the membrane fouling besides natural water environments also contain iron ions the interaction between polysaccharide foulants and these trivalent cations is also significant in understanding the membrane fouling problem trivalent cations are expected to be involved in the gelation im et al 2019 flocculation ma et al 2015 and precipitation processes associated with organic substances teng et al 2020 these processes have distinguished impacts on membrane fouling with corresponding to different interaction mechanisms what s more important these processes may occur simultaneously which leads to a virtually intricate situation however it should be noted that all these processes depend on the interaction between trivalent cations and the organic foulants as long as the exact nature of the interaction mechanism between trivalent cations and organic foulants is explained the related fouling problem can be better understood a similar increasing effect on the interaction of polysaccharides with that of the divalent cation is observed increasing iron ion content converted the colloidal tep into granular tep li et al 2016a however the binding affinities of divalent and trivalent cations to polysaccharides are extremely different it has been demonstrated that the limited capacity of alginate for calcium ions is about 8 carboxyl groups for one calcium ion while it s about 7 carboxyl groups for one aluminum ion gregor et al 1996 similar to the monovalent cation the interaction between the trivalent cation and the polysaccharide is not strong and the formation of tep decreases due to the competition with the divalent cation in the literature there is very few studies focusing on the influence of trivalent cations on polysaccharides interaction as well as the tep formation revealing an obvious lack of mechanistic insights into it 5 conclusions transparent exopolymer particles tep as gel like particulate acidic polysaccharide have been commonly found in feed water to membrane systems thus leading to increasing interest in tep associated membrane fouling the main implications of this review are as follows 1 the determination methods of tep are crucial in defining tep and providing comparable results the separation staining method with suitable adjustments is recommended because it essentially differing tep from other dissolved organic substances 2 the contributions of tep made to membrane fouling include the formation of tep associated gel layer on membrane surface carrying microorganisms to membrane via protobiofilm and escaping of deformable tep from pretreatment units 3 most of tep in the water environments are colloidal tep and the pretreatments including uf can t completely reject tep thus a certain amount of tep reach ro unit causing fouling 4 the formation of tep was largely related to cations in water environments which indeed determined the cross linking degree of precursor materials e g polysaccharides via intermolecular interactions the binding between cations ions e g monovalent divalent and trivalent cations and polysaccharide not only depends on the functional groups of polysaccharide but also its spatial configuration 5 these in turn suggest that the formation property and ultimate fouling potential of tep would be closely related to the type and concentration of cations in water which well explains the controversial reports on tep associated fouling in the literature 6 tep is an ignored determinant of membrane fouling which has not yet been seriously addressed in the design and operation of membrane systems for water and wastewater treatment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

17842,odors from wastewater treatment plants wwtps have attracted extensive attention and stringent environmental standards are more widely adopted to reduce odor emissions biological odor treatment methods have broader applications than the physical and chemical counterparts as they are environment friendly cost effective and generate low secondary wastes the aqueous activated sludge as processes are among the most promising approaches for the prevention or end of pipe removal of odor emissions and have the potential to simultaneously treat odor and wastewater however as deodorization biotechnologies in wwtps still need to be further systematically summarized and categorized while in depth discussions on the characteristics and underlying mechanisms of as deodorization process are still lacking recently considerable studies have been reported to elucidate the microbial metabolisms in odor control and wastewater treatment this paper reviews the fundamentals characteristics advances and field experiences of three as biotechnologies for odor treatment in wwtps i e as recycling microaeration in as digester and as diffusion the underlying deodorization mechanisms of typical odors have been revealed through the summary of recent advances on multi element conversions metabolic interactions of bacteria microscopic characterization and identification of functional microorganisms future research aspects to advance the emerging deodorization as process such as deodorization mechanisms simultaneous odor and water treatment synergistic treatment with other air emissions are discussed graphical abstract image 1 keywords activated sludge odor prevention end of pipe odor removal deodorization mechanisms wastewater treatment 1 introduction unpleasant odors emitted from wastewater treatment plants wwtps have been of great concern for many years especially among local communities with high population density beyond its nuisance effects and health hazards for residential people living around the plant the release of foul odors is also associated with photochemical smog formation and secondary particulate contaminant emissions estrada et al 2011 ren et al 2019 correspondingly more stringent environmental regulations are being developed by the administrative authorities to mitigate the risk of odors a variety of physicochemical and biological odor treatment technologies were proposed among which the latter is preferable in practical applications due to their effective low cost catalyst free and environmentally friendly properties barbusinski et al 2017 estrada et al 2012a conventional media based odor control biotechnologies biofilters biotrickling filters bioscrubbers etc are featured with the limitations such as the media plugging gas short circuiting moisture control and accumulation of toxic metabolites in the systems barbosa et al 2002b kiesewetter et al 2012 in contrast the activated sludge as processes in the liquid based systems can avoid these shortcomings and have the potential to achieve simultaneous treatment of odor and wastewater moreover as based processes can use the existing facilities in wwtps allowing low operating cost but high odor removal efficiency for instance as diffusion requires little additional facilities in wwtps in which odorous air is collected sparged into the aeration tank and subsequently biodegraded barbosa and stuetz 2013 as recycling is another strategy that recycles aerated as or mixed liquor to the inlet of the wwtp headworks thus avoiding the malodorous odor emissions estrada et al 2015 kiesewetter et al 2012 so far as processes were mostly employed as a cost effective alternative to conventional media based odor treatment biosystems due to the lack of performance data and the disagreement upon their effects on wastewater treatment performance however as technologies are gaining increasing attention due to their appreciable merits in odor control a variety of bench scale lebrero et al 2010 moussavi et al 2007 pilot scale barbosa et al 2006a barbosa and stuetz 2013 or even full scale studies kiesewetter et al 2012 vertz et al 2006 have been conducted and the encouraging results confirmed the robustness and efficiency of as systems meanwhile the odor emissions were efficiently treated without compromising the performance of the as process in wastewater treatment barbosa et al 2004 moussavi et al 2007 a number of attempts barbosa et al 2002b estrada et al 2011 2015 kiesewetter et al 2012 lebrero et al 2010 2011 have studied the basics performance design and operating issues as well as other experiences of as biotechnologies in odor control the potentials of as biotechnologies have been well accepted nonetheless the deodorization principles and characteristics of such processes are not systematically interpreted while in depth discussions on the underlying mechanisms of as aided deodorization process are still lacking aghayani et al 2019 pang et al 2017 currently there are a number reviews focusing on odor removal barbusinski et al 2017 jiang et al 2017 in which odor production and emissions characteristics as well as odor treatment methods are systematically summarized and compared their efforts in ranking the complicated odorants or comparing the biological methods are of great importance for the design and optimization of odor treatment and control measures however these efforts are mainly placed on reviewing the odor characteristics or the well developed processing technologies our current review thus aims to pay more attention to the advances and potentials of the emerging as processes in odor abatement so far as technologies for odor treatment have been discussed more broadly than before in technical forums while some significant progress coupled with meaningful discoveries were recently reported to unravel microbial metabolic pathways and characteristics therefore this review is conducted to summarize and critically discuss the approaches and advances of as based biotechnologies in which the findings of chemical and biochemical deodorization mechanisms recently discovered are updated on this basis the promising areas of future research and the associated challenges in the development of as biotechnologies are specially outlined it is expected to improve our understanding on the as deodorization applications and provide an updated guideline for the simultaneous treatment of odor and wastewater in wwtps 2 odor emissions from wastewater treatment processes 2 1 odor emission sources odors emitted in wwtps regardless of the emission zone are mainly produced during anaerobic processes gebicki et al 2016 the sources can be broadly classified as two categories i sewer generations owing to direct chemical discharge or by products derived from anaerobic decomposition of biodegradable materials occurring in sewer networks ii odor emissions in wwtps derived from treatment units and handling facilities of wastewater treatment or excess sludge processing and management jiang et al 2017 muñoz et al 2010 odors generated in sewer networks are emitted mainly in preprocessing units of wwtps fig 1 such as bar screens grit chamber and primary sedimentation tanks psts other locations of intense odor emissions are typically identified as sludge processing e g sludge digestion thickening dewatering and storage units jiang et al 2017 in contrast the odor concentrations in biological treatment units aerobic anoxic tanks and secondary sedimentation are much lower although their emissions may be relatively high carrera chapela et al 2014 thus preprocessing units and sludge handling and pumping facilities entail severe risks in wwtps 2 2 odor characteristics odors in wwtps are typically volatile malodorous compounds with very low olfactory threshold values jiang et al 2017 they are partially involved in the formation of photochemical smog and secondary particulate contaminants in the atmosphere ren et al 2019 the direct effects of odor emissions on people are causing annoyance while other odor induced symptoms may include headache nausea eye irritation respiratory problems vomiting physical disorders etc barbusinski et al 2017 gebicki et al 2016 odorant components are diverse due to the variations in inlet wastewater property wastewater treatment process and sludge management lewkowska et al 2016 even though odorous compounds are generally composed of volatile sulfur compounds vscs such as h2s carbon disulfide diethyl sulfides dimethyl sulfides methanethiol and other mercaptans nitrogen compounds such as nh3 amines amides and indoles and volatile organic compounds vocs such as aromatic aliphatic and halogenated hydrocarbons and volatile fatty acids vfas barbusinski et al 2017 muñoz et al 2010 in particular odor molecules are small unpleasant compounds with a relatively low molecular weight 30 150 g mol but pungent smell karageorgos et al 2010 among the odorous compounds h2s a flammable poisonous and colorless gas with a characteristic smell of rotten eggs is the most frequently reported as a key odorant h2s is either generated from the reduction of sulfate by sulfate reducing microorganisms or the anaerobic decomposition of sulfur containing organics in the wastewater and sludge processing h2s has been traditionally used as an indicator to evaluate the odor treatment performance wang et al 2014 however other odor components such as vscs nh3 volatile fatty acids and amines deserve equal attention when comprehensive risk assessment is required 3 as based processes for odor control in wwtps the deodorization by as processes in wwtps can be achieved through two approaches i prevention of the odorant formation or evaporation into the air and ii collection and treatment of the odors that are produced in the facilities specially from the viewpoint of wwtps applying a prevention plan for wastewater pre treatment or reducing the amount of odor causing compounds produced at the sources are both regarded as prevention measures 3 1 odor prevention 3 1 1 as recycling in wwtps as recycling is a preventative strategy to mitigate odor production and release which is implemented by recycling settled as or mixed liquor from secondary clarifiers or aerobic bioreactors to the inlet of the wwtp headworks fig 2 this method is specially operative for odor prevention in primary sewer processing units e g bar screens filters grit chamber pumping stations and psts which are major odor sources in wwtps jiang et al 2017 odors of untreated wastewater are produced by anaerobic decomposition of biodegradable organics the recycled as from the aeration basin or the secondary settler however creates an anoxic or oxidized environment unsuitable for odor production both as microorganisms and the electron acceptors dissolved oxygen do and nitrate are transferred in as recycling the electron acceptors in the recycled as or mixed liquor can enhance the oxidation of the odorants or the malodorous compound precursors through chemical or microbiological processes kiesewetter et al 2012 the activities of nitrate reducing sulfide oxidizing bacteria nr sob for example can be significantly promoted liang et al 2016 resulting in improved sulfide removal as an odor prevention technology as recycling possesses many merits firstly as recycling represents a fairly cost effective solution to odor control at the primary processing units before biological treatment as recycling requires no construction of extra dedicated facilities and minor additional pipework pump to transfer mixed liquor or as to the inlet works is needed facilities such as the covers of the inlet works and the associated odor collection line are possibly avoided also the operational complexity of as recycling is considered extremely low when compared to other conventional odor control technologies moreover as usually exhibits high biological diversity and thus is able to adsorb and biologically oxidize a variety of odorous compounds such as h2s mercaptans aldehydes amines indoles and vfas estrada et al 2015 as recycling is a relatively new deodorization technology which is not widely investigated and applied based on a lab scale reactor zhang et al 2011 investigated the effects of dosing waste as on the soluble sulfide reduction in raw sewage in which a removal rate of 99 was achieved 0 1 mg l when an iron rich aerated waste as to sewage ratio v v of 16 was applied notably the removal of cod and nitrogen was not impacted short term pilot tests using the as recycling strategy at southern region water reclamation facility palm beach florida were found to achieve around 50 decrease of overall odor emissions harrison et al 2008 two full scale applications of as recycling for odor control also received positive results in the reduction of h2s e g 42 7 vs 3 2 ppm for raw and end concentrations and other sewer gas concentrations e g 0 123 vs 0 0046 ppm for raw and end methyl mercaptan concentrations in which only minor operating issues due to clogging in the valve were reported kiesewetter et al 2012 koetter et al 2014 another trial conducted in lee county wwtp lee county florida indicated better reductions of h2s gas ranging from 87 to 98 whereas grit settling properties within the grit chamber were negatively impacted schmidt et al 2014 a design with limited amount of recycled as was developed to minimize its adverse effects on grit removal during the long term operation 3 1 2 microaeration in as digester as mentioned in section 2 1 sludge processing units in wwtps are an important source of odor emissions e g h2s mainly due to the biogas production in anaerobic digestion ad process of sludge air or oxygen exposure to the ad system is traditionally avoided due to its adverse effects on the growth and activity of obligate anaerobes however recent advances in microaeration technology indicate its diverse beneficial effects on ad process such as scavenging h2s enhancing hydrolysis and stabilizing the process when a small amount of air oxygen is injected into the system nguyen and khanal 2018 the main mechanism of microaeration is to promote the growth of sulfide oxidizing microorganisms so that sulfur is formed as a result of well configured desulfurization process kobayashi et al 2012 in particular an oxidation reduction potential orp in the range of 0 to 300 mv is recommended to maintain the microaerobic condition in the aqueous media of digesters nguyen and khanal 2018 microaeration has gained growing attention in the odor prevention of as processing facilities due to its efficient simple and economic properties moderate aeration in the anaerobic treatment can achieve simultaneous h2s removal and ad preservation as shown in fig 3 microaeration can be realized by dosing air oxygen either in the liquid or gaseous phases while the biogas or liquid is recirculated krayzelova et al 2015 according to previous investigations dosing air in the headspace while maintaining a liquid recirculation is frequently used díaz et al 2011 muñoz et al 2015 since the desulfurization of the biogas occurred inside the ad digester and sometimes mainly in reactor headspace sulfur will clog on the walls and pipes and an extra periodic cleaning operation is thus required kobayashi et al 2012 ramos et al 2014 additionally microaeration may have a potential drawback of resulting in lower methane production due to excessive consumption of soluble substrate and the toxicity of oxygen to methanogens especially when the digesters were in unbalanced conditions krayzelova et al 2015 considerable lab scale studies reported the efficiency of microaeration in the removal of h2s and examined the impacts of reactor configuration the amount and flow rate of air oxygen dosing point mixing method the location of oxidation process ph temperature as well as biogas residence time on reactor performance krayzelova et al 2015 nguyen and khanal 2018 these studies have significantly contributed to the knowledge of process stability control and performance optimization advanced further field tests and full scale applications during the ad investigation of two pilot plant reactors fdz polanco et al 2009 successfully achieved an h2s removal efficiency of above 99 in biogas e g 9318 vs 51 ppm after micoareation the reactor performance in terms of biogas production methane yield and cod removal was not affected in another pilot study ramos and fdz polanco 2014 examined the use of biogas production and h2s concentration as indicators to regulate the oxygen supply to the reactors díaz et al 2015 also evaluated three microaerobic treatment alternatives to fecl3 dosing in full scale sludge digesters and the most profitable one was the injection of concentrated o2 besides the desulfurization efficiency of above 99 was achieved 7580 vs 72 mg m3 through microaeration in a full scale municipal wwtp of central europe jeníček et al 2017 the degradability of cod and volatile suspended solids proved to be enhanced 3 1 3 application potentials as based odor prevention technologies based on as recycling and microaeration both showed great potentials in the odor management systems of wwtps in particular they tackle odors from different sources of the plant as recycling is effective mainly in the wastewater treatment line to reduce or prevent odor emissions from headworks and primary distribution structures such as filters grit chambers and psts microaeration deals with odors in the sludge processing and management line such as sludge digestion dewatering and storage facilities both of the strategies utilized the addition of oxidizing agent oxygen or nitrate and the introduction of active microorganisms to counter the anaerobic decomposition of odorous compounds estrada et al 2015 nguyen and khanal 2018 in the ad system only the oxygen is properly provided as diverse microorganisms already exist in the sludge while in as recycling both the oxidizing agents and microorganisms are supplemented the featured characteristics of as recycling and microaeration are that the investment and operating expenditure along with the operational complexity are extremely low while the overall efficiency is appreciable kiesewetter et al 2012 krayzelova et al 2015 the prevention strategies are even more cost effective than as diffusion as no additional covers pipelines and corrosion protection materials are required microaeration is also correlated with improved hydrolysis of as reduced vfa yield peaks better ph control better sludge quality and system robustness of ad process krayzelova et al 2015 these benefits demonstrate their high potentials to prevent malodorous emissions from wwtps on the other hand concerns needed to be considered and properly addressed while implementing these technologies the operations of as recycling actually combine the traditional primary and secondary wastewater treatment into one as based biological treatment process therefore its effect on screens filters grit chamber psts as well as the established nitrogen phosphate removal needs to be further examined the recycled sludge can increase the hydraulic capacity of wwtps enlarge the workload of the screens filters for solids filtering and may induce the deterioration of the sludge settling properties in psts moreover as recycling can consume the readily biodegradable organics and adversely affect the subsequent performance of biological phosphorus and nitrogen removal especially for wastewater with insufficient carbon source similarly the application of microaeration in the ad process also needs to cope with issues like the oxygen toxicity to methanogens explosion risks of methane oxygen mixtures clogging the walls and pipes excessive soluble carbon consumption etc 3 2 end of pipe odor removal end of pipe odor removal in wwtps is mainly based on covering and extracting foul air from odor production units and treating the gas with specialized biological processes prior to their atmospheric discharge media based systems such as biofilters biotrickling filters and bioscrubbers rely on the inert packings to increase mass transfer mudliar et al 2010 although they commonly employ as as inoculum during the start up estrada et al 2015 these processes are typically independent of wastewater processing units and the associated discussions can be found elsewhere barbusinski et al 2017 mudliar et al 2010 as based technologies for odor treatment discussed below are liquid based systems i e as diffusion which can be incorporated in the wwtp facilities to realize the integrated treatment of odor and wastewater 3 2 1 as diffusion as diffusion which sparges the collected odor emissions into aeration tanks of wwtps is a typical liquid based odor control system using existed as for biodegradation of odorous compounds fig 4 foul air is collected from covered or contained process units and transferred via blowers through a delivery pipework system to submerged coarse or fine bubble diffusers in the as aeration tank the odorous air bubbles are diffused into the mixed liquor together with oxygen where the mechanisms responsible for odor abatement include absorption by the aqueous liquor and as flocs adsorption e g high molecular compounds with low solubility adsorb onto as flocs or condensation e g vocs transferring from relatively warm air into the cooler mixed liquor will condense of odorous compounds and biodegradation by aerobic microorganisms aghayani et al 2019 bowker 2000 lebrero et al 2011 as diffusion has been firstly practiced at wwtps for odor mitigation in united states of america and then adopted in europe since the 1990s while positive results were routinely reported barbosa et al 2006a bowker 2000 kiesewetter et al 2012 currently as diffusion is mainly used as an alternative to media based systems such as biofilters biotrickling filters and bioscrubbers in odor treatment however in terms of various odorant treatment as systems possess the merits of their biological counterparts environmentally friendliness low operating cost and high odor removal efficiency while overcoming most of their major limitations media plugging biomass accumulation ph and moisture control or accumulation of biodegradation metabolites etc aghayani et al 2019 barbosa et al 2002b lebrero et al 2011 for example biotreatment of gases containing chlorinated odorants sulfur compounds or nh3 by biofilters results in accumulation of chloride sulfate or nitrate ions and subsequent acidification of the biofilter moreover the surface area of small air bubbles in as diffusion is larger than that of the thin layer within the porous media of biofilter and biotrickling filter systems barbosa et al 2002b besides the as diffusion technology is especially advantageous in plants with diffusion based aeration systems but having space limitations since only low expenditure such as the addition of pipework protective coatings of aeration blowers and moisture traps are needed bowker 2000 ren et al 2019 most lab investigations of as diffusion received appreciable results moussavi et al 2007 observed high h2s removal efficiencies 94 from a bench scale as system in which the cod reduction was not significantly affected even the inlet h2s concentrations increased to 50 ppm 3 ppm at outlet the adverse effect was that the settling ability of sludge deteriorated however blonda et al 2006 observed similar h2s removal efficiencies 94 while sludge settleability as well as cod removal nitrification and denitrification did not show any response in addition no relevant effects of sulfur compounds on microbial biochemical activity and composition were observed blonda et al 2018 in an as diffusion bioreactor treating synthetic malodorous emissions containing h2s toluene butanone and alpha pinene no clear positive or negative relationship between community characteristics and bioreactor functions was observed under various operating conditions as well rodriguez et al 2017 as diffusion was also compared with biofilter for the treatment of h2s and vocs lebrero et al 2010 2011 the results indicated that as diffusion exhibited a higher robustness towards fluctuations maintained low outlet h2s concentration 1 4 mg m3 while over 95 of butanone 0 34 mg m3 and toluene 0 028 mg m3 was removed the successful applications of as diffusion were also demonstrated through field tests and full scale experience the removal efficiencies of toluene p xylene and dichloromethane dcm in a pilot scale as basin were investigated under various influent voc concentrations liquid depths and air application rates chou and chang 2005 the designed gas treatment reactor achieved 85 removal of vocs toluene and p xylene and 95 removal for dcm in 1 m deep aerated liquid hardy et al 2001 investigated the removal efficiencies of h2s with typical wwtp concentrations 5 ppm in a pilot plant 300 l volume results indicated that h2s removal efficiencies of 98 were consistently achieved without compromising the performance of wastewater treatment process despite that nitrification was interrupted briefly at the start up of h2s diffusion similar high removal rates of h2s was also reported in other pilot scale as diffusion systems while no significant change in filamentous organisms and major effluent indexes e g cod and ammonium were observed barbosa et al 2002a 2004 the performance of as diffusion at high h2s concentrations e g 150 ppmv were evaluated in pilots scale trials and removal rates of 100 or around were obtained for all inlet concentrations barbosa et al 2006a barbosa and stuetz 2013 similarly over 99 9 of h2s removal was observed in two regional full scale wwtps of texas usa when the foul air with an average inlet h2s concentration of 70 or 50 ppmv were collected from various sources of the plant vertz et al 2006 3 2 2 application potentials when odor preventive measures are insufficient to mitigate odor emissions end of the pipe odor abatement technologies must be applied as a liquid based system as diffusion is featured with high odor removal efficiency coupled with low investment and operating expenses as diffusion can be used as a dual role system to achieve integrated odor control and wastewater treatment however the widespread implementation of as diffusion is hampered by the lack of full scale data concerning its performance during the treatment of odorous vocs and the lack of knowledge on the ability of as systems to cope with process fluctuations and operational failures barbosa and stuetz 2013 bowker 2000 rodriguez et al 2017 other issues of as diffusion may include nitrification inhibition reduction of as settling efficiency possible adverse effects on wastewater treatment corrosion of pipes blower and other equipment although they could be overcome by biomass acclimation as well as proper design and operation practices barbosa et al 2002b kiesewetter et al 2012 according to the operation principle of as diffusion the mass transfer e g hydrophobic vocs and biodegradation are two main steps limiting the removal of the target contaminants patel et al 2017 on this basis aghayani et al 2019 achieved improved biodegradation of toluene vapors in the as diffusion process by inserting moving media along with stimulation of biosurfactant producing bacteria by h2o2 this system is also promising for efficient biodegradation and mineralization of aromatic hydrocarbons of odor yan et al 2016 also reported in situ enhanced deodorization nh3 h2s dimethyl sulfide and dimethyl disulfide in an a2o wastewater treatment system by adding humus soil to stimulate functional bacteria due to the high deodorization potential of as and the diverse merits of as diffusion as diffusion is highly worth considering as partial or overall odor control strategies in wwtps in general the selection of the precautionary and end of the pipe odor treatment technology in each specific wwtp depends on the characteristics concentration and properties of odorants the level of efficiency required the type of odor sources etc odor control involves a combination of odor processing via efficient design and operation practices of certain technology as well as odor containment via the installation of process covers the three as technologies i e as recycling microaeration and as diffusion for odor control all possess their distinctive benefits as well as specific issues in deodorization applications however these issues will be gradually addressed or controlled to an acceptable level since increasing studies in field trials have examined the design issues and operating parameters of as application in odor abatement meanwhile mechanism based studies have attempted to systematically elucidate odor transformation and elimination behaviors from microscopic and microbiological views 4 deodorization mechanisms in as processes of wwtps the odor nh3 is highly soluble in water thus it can be easily absorbed into aqueous as system and transformed into nitrite and nitrate through microbial nitrification process reduced sulfur compound h2s is typically considered to be a dominant contributor of odor emission in wwtps pang et al 2017 wang et al 2014 in certain circumstances odor abatement effectiveness can be at least partially represented by the measurement of h2s concentration coupled with other characteristic odors this review thus mainly focuses on the mechanism and characteristics of sulfur related odor control and wastewater treatment 4 1 h2s production and polysulfide as mentioned in section 2 2 h2s is anaerobically generated either from sulfate reduction or the decomposition of organic sulfur compounds in the wastewater and sludge digestion process the addition of nitrate is commonly employed as an effective approach to mitigate h2s production in sewer systems the main mechanism is by utilizing nr sob to biologically oxidize sulfide to elemental sulfur or sulfate liang et al 2016 lin et al 2018 as described in eqs 1 and 2 1 s 2 0 4 n o 3 2 4 h s 0 0 2 n 2 1 2 h 2 o δ g 0 191 0 kj 2 s 0 1 2 n o 3 0 4 h 2 o s o 4 2 0 6 n 2 0 8 h δ g 0 547 6 kj however the quick rebound of sulfide concentration after nitrate depletion was observed and resulted in more serious odor and corrosion problems in downstream wwtps jiang et al 2013 liang et al 2016 investigated the mechanism of sulfide regeneration in a laboratory scale sewer reactor and proved indirect sulfur reduction via polysulfide was the key path for the quick rebound of sulfide concentration the reactive polysulfide sn 2 is formed either abiotically or microbially through the reaction of elemental sulfur with sulfide in which the s8 ring of elemental sulfur is cleaved by a nucleophilic attack of the hs anion eq 3 rabus et al 2013 3 hs n 1 s 0 s n 2 h as illustrated by fig 5 polysulfide is the key intermediate for indirect sulfur reduction that enables the elemental sulfur to dissolve in the aqueous phase and enhances its bioavailability for sulfur reducing microorganisms in the presence of nitrate the sulfide in the sewer was chemically and biologically oxidized into major product elemental sulfur and was further deposited in sewer sediment and biofilm jiang et al 2013 after the nitrate depletion polysulfide formed by elemental sulfur and sulfide and was further utilized by sulfur reducers to enhance the sulfur reduction rate resulting in the quick increase of sulfide concentration the sulfide produced will in turn promote polysulfide formation thus achieving a high rate sulfur reduction through a polysulfide involved self accelerating way zhang et al 2018 notably sulfur coming from upstream can accumulate and be reduced quickly in such conditions and cause more serious odor and corrosion problems in the downstream sewer the direct sulfur reduction in fig 5 is a slow process and would not induce serious sulfide regeneration in sewer systems the finding that polysulfide is the key intermediate for accelerating sulfur reduction provides constructive guidance for the application of as recycling in the odor prevention of wwtps effective sulfide elimination always involves the efficient control of the intermediate polysulfide formation which can be achieved through the addition of iron salts batch tests of liang et al 2016 revealed that when polysulfide formation was prevented by the ferrous chloride addition the sulfur reduction rate remarkably decreased from 12 8 to 1 8 mgs l h this may partially explain the excellent sulfide control results of zhang et al 2011 and ge et al 2013 using iron salt as additives 4 2 sulfide elimination by nitrate and oxygen 4 2 1 chemical and biological oxidation oxygen and nitrate are the two most common electron acceptors in the as system responsible for sulfide oxidation and odor removal specially nitrate was main electron acceptor 6 10 mg l after the oxygen depletion 2 3 mg l only in as recycling practices estrada et al 2015 a series of chemical and biochemical reactions occur in complex as system during sulfide oxidation the chemical auto oxidation of sulfide by oxygen can yield elemental sulfur s0 sulfite so3 2 thiosulfate s2o3 2 sulfate so4 2 or other sulfur species depending on the sulfide concentration and specific environmental conditions lin et al 2018 on the other hand biological sulfide oxidation is accomplished by the activities of chemolithotrophic sulfide and sulfur oxidizing bacteria sob specifically nr sob utilize electron acceptor nitrate to remove sulfide eq 1 and 2 while other sob can resort to oxygen for sulfide oxidation through biochemical pathways revealed in eqs 4 6 guo et al 2019a ramos et al 2013 4 h 2 s 0 5 o 2 s 0 h 2 o δ g 0 209 4 kj 5 s 0 1 5 o 2 s o 4 2 2 h δ g 0 587 1 kj 6 h 2 s 2 o 2 s o 4 2 2 h δ g 0 798 2 kj 4 2 2 biochemical interactions and microscopic mechanisms the biochemical interactions and mechanisms of nitrate induced sulfide removal in wwtps always involved the simultaneous biological removal of elements nitrogen sulfur carbon which was termed as denitrifying sulfide removal dsr process as shown in fig 6 both autotrophic and heterotrophic denitrifiers are actively involved in the dsr process at the presence of nitrate sulfide can be partially oxidized into elemental sulfur by autotrophic denitrifiers lin et al 2018 which deposits in the biofilms or sediments meanwhile nitrate can be removed by converting nitrate into nitrogen through both autotrophic and heterotrophic denitrifiers in an anaerobic or anoxic environment qian et al 2017 heterotrophic denitrifiers will metabolize the available organic carbon source malodorous odorants and their precursors in sewer included into inorganic carbon resulting in their removal from the system interestingly during the sulfide oxidation process the bioavailable compounds of sn 2 and or elemental s0 poly s proved to be stored in microbial cells guo et al 2017 wu et al 2014 further investigations by guo et al 2019b indicated that the co existence of sn 2 s0 as poly s could be stored either intracellularly or extracellularly by microorganisms the storage states and the dynamic conversions between s0 sn 2 and other sulfur species were for the first time clarified by the integrated chemical analysis and raman micro spectroscopy rms coupled with multiple microscopic methods the research further implied there might be a universal pool of bioavailable sulfur that facilitated their transfer between intermolecular or interspecies guo et al 2019b the adsorption and oxidation mechanism of sulfide in the as process was also examined by pang et al 2017 in which the interaction of as and sulfides was examined by scanning electron microscope energy dispersive spectrometer sem eds test and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps test the sem eds results revealed that removed sulfur in aqueous solution was fixed in as while an oxidation state of 2 for fixed sulfur was observed in the xps analysis fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir analysis demonstrated one of the radical groups bonding sulfides on as was the primary amine group r nh2 it was concluded that sulfides removal by as was primarily attributed to adsorption rather than biodegradation within 40 min the adsorption was an endothermic process and chemical sorption or ion exchange process was the main adsorption mechanism it is noteworthy that hydraulic retention time hrt in the as system for wastewater treatment is usually hours which allows sufficient degradation of sulfide and other malodorous organics overall the recent advances in microscopic mechanisms of sulfide adsorption and biochemical conversion have significantly enriched our knowledge on the sulfide metabolic pathways in as 4 2 3 sulfur recovery mechanisms as stated by guo et al 2019b poly s could be stored either intracellularly or extracellularly by microorganisms in the desulfurization process the sulfur particles produced by sob are attached with a composite charged layer that primarily contains polysulfides and polyorganics cai et al 2017 sposob et al 2017 which can be readily utilized by sulfur reducing microorganisms to produce sulfide and generate h2s emissions thus sulfur recovery in wwtps despite its possible use as a resource in agriculture and industrial activities e g fertilizer and other raw materials manufacturing is also an important step in preventing further odor emissions lin et al 2018 biologically produced sulfur either in granular or filamentous shape is very different from ordinary elemental sulfur cai et al 2017 in most cases the charged sulfur particles are hydrophilic and bioavailable mutually repel each other and exist in colloidal forms to separate the biosulfur feng et al 2018 investigated the sulfur recovery mechanism in an internal airlift loop reactor with the aid of flocculant producer pseudomonas sp strain n1 2 and ca2 coagulant as indicated in fig 7 the stable colloidal s0 enriched in co bond po band nh groups and other functional groups of acids alcohols and proteins polysaccharides ftir results the biosulfur product did not settle naturally forming milky white suspensions in the water sample the strain pseudomonas sp present in as was able to utilize organics and generate flocculants such as extracellular polymeric substance eps which destroyed the colloidal sulfur stable state and facilitated sulfur sedimentation with the aid of ca2 coagulant the biosulfur product was neutralized in charge attached to the coagulant molecule and finally combined with eps to generate bioflocculant s0 sem analysis showed that the surface of the flocculated sulfur was smooth while the reticular organics attached on s0 polysaccharides and proteins had irregular shape and rough surface the interlaced three dimensional network structure is believed to facilitate subsequent flocculation sedimentation and other sulfur recovery practices chen et al 2016 4 3 sulfur involved integrated odor and wastewater treatment 4 3 1 simultaneous removal of nitrogen sulfur and carbon one of the merits of as recycling in deodorization is that it can result in simultaneous removal of nitrogen sulfur and carbon in wastewater treatment practices after the depletion of electron acceptor oxygen small amounts in the recycled as nitrogen was utilized for deodorization studies achieving the simultaneous nitrogen sulfur and carbon removal by dsr process were widely reported factors ph temperature variations in sulfur species and organics exerted various influence on the sulfur species transformations as well as the denitratation and denitritation process qian et al 2017 sposob et al 2017 interestingly as revealed by a laboratory scale study of yang et al 2016 extra decreases in n2o emissions were observed during the sulfide driven autotrophic denitrification process in the granular sludge reactor in addition a typical facultative strain pseudomonas sp c27 capable of conducting mixotrophic dsr reactions using both organic matters and sulfide as electron donors was employed to examine the metabolic mechanism in the dsr process guo et al 2014a quantitative proteomic analysis revealed a new pathway from acetate to pyruvate with coupled sulfur and nitrogen cycles and the newly proposed coupled cycles pathway under excess carbon supply was discussed and slightly modified guo et al 2015 these studies indirectly indicated the feasibility of as recycling in simultaneous nitrogen sulfur carbon removal and pinpointed the internal mechanism of nitrate dominated deodorization apart from nitrate trace oxygen in as can also stimulate microorganism activities and effectively reduce sulfide levels thus facilitating the odor prevention process fig 6 in a simultaneous sulfide and nitrate removal reactor wang et al 2015b adopted 0 1 0 3 mg l of do and improved the efficiencies of s0 regeneration sulfide oxidation and nitrate reduction the micro aerobic condition resulted in the sulfide and nitrate removal efficiency of 100 and 90 respectively the micro aerobic enhancement for dsr at high carbon to nitrogen ratios was also examined by chen et al 2017 the reactor achieved 100 sulfide removal with 5 sulfide was removed by chemical oxidation pathway moreover metabolic studies were conducted focusing on specific strains penibacillus sp and aneurinibacillus aneurinilyticus chen et al 2010 and the associated proteomic analysis of mixotrophic sob pseudomonas sp c27 was used to reveal the underlying microbial mechanism for sulfur nitrogen carbon removal guo et al 2014b microaerobic conditions increased the rates of protein synthesis e g sulfide oxidase and cell growth which enhanced cell defensive system the nitrogen and oxygen involved sulfide removal studies have provided valuable guidance for wwtp deodorization before the assessment design and operation practices of as recycling 4 3 2 sulfur cycle enhanced biological phosphorus removal the municipal wastewater of coastal cities contains a significant concentration of sulfate around 50 500 mg s so4 l which originated from various sources liu et al 2016 under anaerobic anoxic conditions sulfate can be reduced to sulfide and contributes to odor emissions additionally the accumulated toxic sulfide can damage wastewater transport systems and hinder microbial processes in wwtps such as the conventional enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr this is linked to the fact that the functional polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos are sensitive to high sulfate reduction wu et al 2018 to overcome this limitation a novel limited oxygen sulfur cycle associated ebpr los ebpr process was developed for p removal which was further modified to denitrifying sulfur cycle associated ebpr ds ebpr system due to the low oxygen transfer rate wu et al 2014 in this novel anaerobic anoxic ds ebpr system denitrifying paos was used for simultaneous anoxic p uptake and anaerobic denitrification accompanied by p release guo et al 2019a 2019b during the anaerobic phase of the ds ebpr system fig 8 both sulfate reducing bacteria srb and sob take up the vfas for sulfate reduction to form poly s in srb and synthesize polyhydroxyalkanoates pha in sob respectively at the same time sob release p from the cleavage of poly p accompanied by glycogen degradation and poly s ingestion from srb during the subsequent anoxic phase sob oxidize intracellular pha and poly s using the electron acceptor nitrate for energy and biomass production glycogen replenishment sulfate production p uptake and poly p storage in this stage nitrate and phosphate in wastewater are simultaneously removed through the synergistic interaction of srb and sob the mechanism has greatly enhanced the understanding of ds ebpr process although issues such as the internal polymer transfer and conversions the full metabolic pathways of srb and sob are yet to be revealed guo et al 2016 2019a the system will guide deodorization as recycling applications in wwtps of coastal cities receiving sulfate laden wastewater 4 4 removal of vocs vocs are important components of odor emissions from wwtps featured with low water solubility high persistence and toxicity the performance of voc treatment was usually determined by the limited mass transfer from gaseous phase to aqueous phase rather than by the biodegradation process patel et al 2017 the performance data on the vocs treatment by as process as well as the associated biological mechanism studies are not widely reported generally the control of vocs emissions in as systems can be enhanced by increasing active biomass concentration hydraulic retention time and oxygen transfer efficiency using fine diffusers or by the addition of surfactant and suspended carrier aghayani et al 2019 fallah et al 2010 hsieh 2000 padalkar and kumar 2018 temperature variations also affect henry s law constants for vocs and their subsequent removal lin and chou 2006 aghayani et al 2019 used acclimated biomass pseudomonas spp and bacillus spp mixture capable of in situ biosurfactant generation to improve toluene bioavailability and inserted moving media into the as system to increase the gas liquid contact surface hydrogen peroxide h2o2 was added to stimulate the production of oxidative enzyme peroxidase which can efficiently catalyze the carbon carbon bond cleavage reactions in the toluene structure and generate more biodegradable intermediates moussavi et al 2017 moreover h2o2 addition also stimulated the microbial biosurfactant production and further enhanced the gas to liquid mass transfer of toluene since the mass transfer of vocs from air to water is closely associated with the cell surface characteristics of microorganisms filamentous fungi with large specific surface area in its mycelium and better adaptabilities under undesirable conditions dry weak acid etc have attracted increasing attention cheng et al 2019 vergara fernández et al 2016 the differences of cell surface characteristics between the bacterium pseudomonas veronii and fungus ophiostoma stenoceras was investigated by cheng et al 2019 and the fungus exhibited better performance in capturing and adsorbing organic compounds in liquid and gas phases the adsorption mechanisms of hydrophobic vocs indicated the langmuir model representing physical monolayer adsorption dominated in the process the xps characterization and ftir analysis further confirmed that several functional groups co c o op etc and hydrocarbon like compounds chc in the surface of the fungal cells were crucial for adsorption the addition of ophiostoma stenoceras into the bacterial system reduced the time taken for complete degradation of hexane tetrahydrofuran and chlorobenzene because fungal hypha provided better micro environment for the nutrient transport and gaseous substrate diffusion to bacteria vergara fernández et al 2016 4 5 functional microorganisms 4 5 1 sob in aqueous deodorization systems sob are the main groups involved in sulfide oxidation and deodorization under aerobic as diffusion microaerobic microaeration in digester or denitrifying as systems as recycling due to their oxidation potential of reduced inorganic sulfur species such as sulfide and thiosulfate guo et al 2019a biological removal of sulfides is based on the activities of photoautotrophic or chemolithotrophic sob photoautotrophic sob obtain energy from light while chemolithotrophic sob obtain energy from biochemical reactions using oxygen aerobic species or nitrate and nitrite anaerobic species thus chemolithotrophic sob are technologically more suitable for the biological removal of sulfides in as systems due to their flexibility in environmental adaptation and high sulfide tolerance lin et al 2018 table 1 summarized the functional sob in aqueous as systems for sulfide oxidation or simultaneous h2s and wastewater treatment the most cited sob species were thiobacillus species which were short rod shaped microorganisms reported both in anaerobic and aerobic systems krayzelova et al 2015 the species belonging to genera arcobacter paracoccus and sulfurimonas were also found in microaerobic or denitrifying conditions kobayashi et al 2012 wu et al 2018 yu et al 2014 another group of sob which are morphologically and taxonomically distinct contain long filamentous bacteria beggiatoa and thiothrix species pokorna and zabranska 2015 interestingly pseudomonas stutzeri qz1 paracoccus denitrificans and some species of thiobacillus and beggiatoa are typical examples of facultative chemolithotrophic sob that can grow either autotrophically or heterotrophically krayzelova et al 2015 mahmood et al 2009 in the dsr process huang et al 2015a investigated microbial community structure under different sulfide nitrate loading ratios the results indicated that in the optimized s2 no3 ratio of 5 6 sob species such as thauera and thiobacillus predominated and the sulfide quinone reductase sqr gene was highly expressed in sulfide oxidation process with the increased loading of nitrate the nirk gene encoding the copper containing nitrite reductase increased which confirmed the nitrate reduction process correspondingly the soxb gene encoding soxb subunit of the sox enzyme system in the oxidization of sulfide elemental sulfur and thiosulfate into sulfate expressed increasingly in an anaerobic baffled reactor with separated sulfate reduction and dsr units huang et al 2015b the adenosine 5 phosphosulfate reductase alpha subunit apra gene expressed by sob sulfurovum sp or acidiferrobacter sp functional for sulfite oxidation dominated in dsr process the sat gene by halothiobacillus neapolitanus encoding sulfate adenosine transferases which oxidizes the acylated sulfite to sulfate and produces atp and sulfuric acid was also reported in sulfide wastewater treatment feng et al 2018 under high sulfide stress sqr sat and cytochrome c3 encoding cytochrome c oxidase for thiosulfate oxidation were observed with increased expressions 4 5 2 other deodorization microorganisms odors emitted from wwtps are a mixture of complex components and are thus removed through a variety of microbial communities microorganisms exhibit various degradation performance in treating specific odorants a pseudomonas sp strain wl2 which was isolated from the as of a pharmaceutical wastewater plant could efficiently metabolize ethyl mercaptan into diethyl disulfide wang et al 2015a in a microbial community isolated from as estrada et al 2012b found some species of the genus acinetobacter proved to be fast growing bacteria capable of growing at high toluene concentrations on the other hand the slow growing microorganisms belonging to the genera pseudonocardia mycobacterium nitrospira and members of the orders rhodocyclales and rhodospirillales are also able to degrade toluene at low concentrations toluene can also be captured and degraded when it was sparged into the aqueous culture media of pseudomonas putida in an external loop airlift bioreactor harding et al 2003 with the successful operation of the reactor the continuous sparging of toluene contaminated air finally reached a removal efficiency of 100 additionally the genera rhizobium pseudomonas burkholderia rhodobacter gemmobacter chitinophaga vampirovibrio fodinicurvata hyphomicrobium mycobacterium xanthobacter in aqueous systems were reported as dichloromethane toluene or other voc degraders as well dobslaw and engesser 2015 wu et al 2017 xu et al 2019 in an as diffusion system by rodriguez et al 2017 microbial community changes under different operational parameters were examined in the treatment of a synthetic malodorous emission containing h2s toluene butanone and alpha pinene although functional bacteria such as bacterial genera nitrospira rhodanobacter comamonas as well as fusarium and chaetothyriales like fungi were detected no clear positive or negative relationship between community characteristics and bioreactor functions was observed instead evenness and community dynamics seemed to play a role in maintaining reactor stability the inoculated alpha pinene degrader pseudomonas fluorescens was likely outcompeted by the microorganisms already adapted to the as environment it is implied that the as system in wwtps contains a variety of functional microorganisms that are responsible for the wastewater treatment as well as the odorous compound removal 5 trends and future directions of as processes for odor control despite of the great advances made and the promising aspects keeping the emerging as technologies at the core of interest there are still several challenges ahead before they become well established biological deodorization processes in this section several aspects are proposed to advance further research or engineering based exploration activities 5 1 enhancement of current as based processes 5 1 1 in depth investigations of the operational issues the as based processes discussed above are all cost effective odor control approaches nevertheless the operational issues related to as biotechnologies in odor control should be subject to detailed examination and in depth elucidation for example the sludge type e g anaerobic aerobic or iron dosed sludge showed nonnegligible effect on the as to degrade odors barbosa et al 2002b fisher et al 2018 which could be an interesting future topic long term and or large scale operation of as diffusion is needed to examine its possible adverse effects on wastewater treatment its robustness towards process fluctuations and operational failures as well as the removal efficiency of various vocs specially the effect of filamentous sulfur bacteria on as properties the treatment capacity the energetic biogas production efficiency with oxygen involvement in as processes all deserve further in depth investigations in odor control practices as a unique as treatment system membrane bioreactors mbr combine the membrane separation and biological wastewater treatment process mbr systems eliminate the need for secondary clarifier and allow high concentrations of mlss fallah et al 2010 which is appreciable in as deodorization processes with higher amounts of mlss in mbr systems there is increased as viscosity that can enhance the as adsorption ability towards odorants moreover the abundant functional microorganisms enable the system more efficient in odor degradation and more resistant to process fluctuations and operational failures unfortunately very limited studies tackled this area and there is a lack of knowledge on the as deodorization ability in mbr systems 5 1 2 hybrid technologies robustness analysis revealed that hybrid technologies are more resistant to process fluctuations and operational upsets than sing use technology estrada et al 2012a the combination of as and the addition of chemicals such as iron salt treatment exerted multiple beneficial effects for integrated odor and wastewater ge et al 2013 rebosura et al 2018 meanwhile methane production and other digestion processes were not negatively impacted in a hybrid pilot scale study the ferric iron addition was coupled with biological treatment for efficient h2s removal from biogas and the chemical biological system exhibited great potential for biogas purification and power generation lin et al 2013 the involvement of chemicals e g h2o2 in as systems can promote the mass transfer and biodegradation especially in environments when high levels of sulfide cause toxic effects to microbial cells aghayani et al 2019 therefore due to the great benefits of hybrid technologies in deodorization biogas purification and wastewater treatment the process control mechanism and kinetic investigations of the systems are promising 5 2 further deodorization mechanism investigations 5 2 1 eps odorant interactions eps are natural polymers of high molecular weight secreted from microorganisms attaching to the cell surface which are responsible for sludge aggregation and the removal of pollutants in terms of sulfur recovery in sulfide wastewater treatment organic eps were able to destroy the stable state of colloidal sulfur and facilitate biosulfur sedimentation feng et al 2018 the interaction mechanism of eps and pollutants can include adsorption surface chelation complexation ion exchange precipitation metabolism etc tian et al 2019 thus eps play an important role in the adsorption and subsequent degradation of malodorous compounds and their precursors nevertheless very limited studies so far tackled linking the production structure chemical composition characteristics and roles of eps with deodorization in wwtps their functions and interaction mechanisms with odorants in different as systems are thus should be examined 5 2 2 microscopic and spectroscopic characterization the characteristics of microbial cell surfaces and polymers secreted by microorganisms are key elements to reveal microbial metabolic activities these characteristics have been qualitatively visualized by conventional microscopic methods e g optical or fluorescence microscopes or quantitatively analyzed by ex situ chemical measurements however limited information is available regarding the detailed cell surface functions and biogenic polymer properties such as composition structure charges and storage states guo et al 2019b used raman analysis for the first time unraveled the co existence of s0 sn 2 species either intracellularly or extracellularly stored as poly s in biological sulfur conversions even though both the deodorization mechanisms of typical odors and the biochemical mechanisms in integrated odor and wastewater treatment still deserve to be further examined guo et al 2019a pang et al 2017 microscopic and spectroscopic tools e g sem eds xps ftir rms coupled with other sophisticated instrumental analyses are recommended to reveal as and microbial cell surface characteristics such as the pivotal components functional groups major elements and their oxidation states 5 2 3 microbial community and metabolic analysis the composition distribution and dynamics of microbial communities in odor treatment systems play main roles in maintaining the system functional stability currently research efforts of molecular analysis have mainly been placed on biofilters and biotrickling filters due to their wide application barbusinski et al 2017 nevertheless microbial diversity analysis ecological network analysis and characteristics of functional microorganisms in emerging as deodorization technologies such as as diffusion or as recycling systems have been rarely studied rodriguez et al 2017 for instance biomass can acclimate to odor involvement thus countering nitrification inhibition effects whereas the key microorganisms in this process remain unclear therefore molecular tools are encouraged to reveal the structure and dynamics of microbial communities as well as characteristics and roles of keynote microorganisms in the as deodorization process meanwhile the metabolic pathways of odorants and nitrogen carbon phosphate by as microorganisms should be further clarified through diverse approaches such as gene expression transcriptomic analysis metabolomics analysis proteomic analysis community level physiological profiling clpp and stable isotope labeling 5 2 4 isolation and characterization of functional bacterial strains in most biological systems bacteria in the as play the main role in the transformation and degradation of organic and inorganic compounds as well as odorants introduced into the system the isolation and characterization of functional bacterial strains responsible for odor removal or sulfur recovery can improve our understanding of the bacteria properties barbosa et al 2006b feng et al 2018 pokorna krayzelova et al 2018 conducted batch experiments to study final products and kinetics of biochemical and chemical sulfide oxidation under microaerobic conditions in which a strain of sulfuricurvum kujiense was utilized the exact sulfide transformation pathways and the characteristics of biochemical and chemical sulfide oxidation were revealed thus the behavior sensitivity population dynamics metabolic pathways and pairwise interactions of functional bacterial strains under defined environments deserved to be deliberately studied and compared with microbial consortiums in as systems guo et al 2014b 2015 the meaningful findings will provide reference or instructions for the establishment of efficient as systems in integrated odor and wastewater treatment 5 2 5 model analysis model analysis is a helpful tool of process simulation aimed for better understanding of process performance and underlying mechanisms xu et al 2013 described the sulfate reducing and sulfide oxidizing process using model analysis during the microaerophilic treatment sulfate bearing wastewaters and the associated sulfur recovery studies the developed model helped to better understand the procedure of elemental sulfur formation and identify the importance of s2 s 0 cycles currently although there are a few modeling papers describing microaeration for biogas desulfurization and dsr process donoso bravo et al 2018 xu et al 2016 detailed modeling of as processes in odor control and wastewater treatment is still lacking the model analysis of biochemical and chemical deodorization process as well as the associated microbial pathways under different circumstances remain an important research gap 5 3 further investigations on vocs vocs are major constituents of odors emitted from wwtps and the limited removal ability of hydrophobic vocs are major concerns of some as biotechnologies such as as diffusion so far the removal mechanisms of vocs in the abovementioned as processes remain unclear although research efforts on the removal performance and biodegradation mechanism of vocs in other biological systems have been conducted padalkar and kumar 2018 xu et al 2019 further research efforts such as the involvement of high mlss biosurfactant or biosurfactant generating biomass dedicate mechanical design will enhance the removal performance of vocs in particular volatile organic sulfur compounds are important components of wastewater odor which deserve to be exclusively and comprehensively examined both in mechanism based investigations and field applications 5 4 simultaneous odor and water treatment as processes have the potential of achieving simultaneous odor and wastewater treatment in wwtps as a result of various anthropogenic activities and some natural saltwater intrusion in coastal aquifers wwtps are receiving increased sulfate laden wastewater lin et al 2018 this can cause serious odor and corrosion problem in a sewer system or anaerobic wastewater treatment units liang et al 2016 on the other side it provides an opportunity to combine the treatment of carbon nitrogen sulfate and phosphate in one integrated bioprocess system guo et al 2019a the development of ds ebpr system which successfully exploited the metabolic phases of sob and srb communities was an example of coping with such challenges guo et al 2017 2019b however the metabolic pathways of system functional microorganisms have not been completely unraveled while challenges such as the balance control of the diverse microorganisms and large scale applications of the system still exist other future efforts could also include the development of new feasible integrated as systems for the simultaneous removal of contaminants and recovery of useful nutrients 5 5 synergistic treatment with other air emissions 5 5 1 greenhouse gases wwtps have been regarded as an important contributor to the global greenhouse gas stock and the three major greenhouse gases include n2o co2 and ch4 campos et al 2016 notably n2o has an approximate global warming potential 300 fold stronger than co2 which can be produced during nitrification and denitrification process greenhouse gas emission is becoming one of the key aspects in the overall performance of the wwtps due to its concerns of climate change and air pollution the greenhouse gas emissions can be minimized through modifying the operational conditions or collected and treated by low cost abatement technologies in wwtps however they were mostly treated without considering the simultaneous removal effects of odors especially in the deodorization as processes one of the encouraging preventive measures of greenhouse gas emissions in the next generation of wwtps is to apply partial nitritation anammox processes to remove ammonia campos et al 2016 this approach maximizes the anaerobic pathway for organic matter removal which agrees well with the principles of as recycling for odor control the various synergistic treatment strategies of greenhouse gas and odors are worth considering in the near future 5 5 2 bioaerosols bioaerosol emissions from wwtps have attracted broad attention owing to the concerns of emitted hazardous components such as pathogenic bacteria viruses fungi and their metabolic products lehtinen et al 2013 park et al 2011 bioaerosols can be produced in the process of bubble aeration mechanical agitation and sludge dewatering which are from the grit chamber the biological treatment unit sludge dewatering room and other facilities of wwtps apart from their atmospheric and ecological impacts bioaerosols can become a serious risk to health of the population in recent decades increasing research interests have been placed in bioaerosol field thus triggering many outstanding research opportunities yao 2018 bioaerosol is a subject involving multidisciplinary research fields such as microbiology air pollution medical science biochemistry and etc gaseous odors and bioaerosols are both undesirable atmospheric contaminants in wwtps and may be emitted from similar facilities although a few studies involved the simultaneous removal of odors and bioaerosols in various systems lehtinen et al 2013 park et al 2011 their synergistic treatment evaluation and assessment in as processes currently remain a research gap 6 conclusions recently there has been a growing interest regarding the as based deodorization technologies in wwtps due to their great economic and technological potentials in this paper recent advances on three as technologies of odor treatment i e as recycling microaeration in digesters and as diffusion were reviewed they are all environmentally friendly economic precautionary or end of the pipe odor treatment strategies with appreciable odor removal efficiency which can be integrated with wastewater treatment facilities the utilization of electron acceptors dissolved oxygen do and nitrate by as microorganisms in deodorization were the main treatment principles polysulfide was of vital importance in h2s production by sulfate reducing microorganisms the underlying deodorization mechanisms involved multi element conversions and metabolic activities of diverse sob species of which poly s were key intermediates as technologies have the potential to simultaneously remove carbon nitrogen sulfur and phosphate in integrated systems thus simultaneous odor and wastewater treatment by as technology is one valuable topic in future deodorization studies other future trends of as processes for odor control such as in depth deodorization mechanism investigations and synergistic treatment with other air emissions were proposed as well declaration of competing interest the

17842,odors from wastewater treatment plants wwtps have attracted extensive attention and stringent environmental standards are more widely adopted to reduce odor emissions biological odor treatment methods have broader applications than the physical and chemical counterparts as they are environment friendly cost effective and generate low secondary wastes the aqueous activated sludge as processes are among the most promising approaches for the prevention or end of pipe removal of odor emissions and have the potential to simultaneously treat odor and wastewater however as deodorization biotechnologies in wwtps still need to be further systematically summarized and categorized while in depth discussions on the characteristics and underlying mechanisms of as deodorization process are still lacking recently considerable studies have been reported to elucidate the microbial metabolisms in odor control and wastewater treatment this paper reviews the fundamentals characteristics advances and field experiences of three as biotechnologies for odor treatment in wwtps i e as recycling microaeration in as digester and as diffusion the underlying deodorization mechanisms of typical odors have been revealed through the summary of recent advances on multi element conversions metabolic interactions of bacteria microscopic characterization and identification of functional microorganisms future research aspects to advance the emerging deodorization as process such as deodorization mechanisms simultaneous odor and water treatment synergistic treatment with other air emissions are discussed graphical abstract image 1 keywords activated sludge odor prevention end of pipe odor removal deodorization mechanisms wastewater treatment 1 introduction unpleasant odors emitted from wastewater treatment plants wwtps have been of great concern for many years especially among local communities with high population density beyond its nuisance effects and health hazards for residential people living around the plant the release of foul odors is also associated with photochemical smog formation and secondary particulate contaminant emissions estrada et al 2011 ren et al 2019 correspondingly more stringent environmental regulations are being developed by the administrative authorities to mitigate the risk of odors a variety of physicochemical and biological odor treatment technologies were proposed among which the latter is preferable in practical applications due to their effective low cost catalyst free and environmentally friendly properties barbusinski et al 2017 estrada et al 2012a conventional media based odor control biotechnologies biofilters biotrickling filters bioscrubbers etc are featured with the limitations such as the media plugging gas short circuiting moisture control and accumulation of toxic metabolites in the systems barbosa et al 2002b kiesewetter et al 2012 in contrast the activated sludge as processes in the liquid based systems can avoid these shortcomings and have the potential to achieve simultaneous treatment of odor and wastewater moreover as based processes can use the existing facilities in wwtps allowing low operating cost but high odor removal efficiency for instance as diffusion requires little additional facilities in wwtps in which odorous air is collected sparged into the aeration tank and subsequently biodegraded barbosa and stuetz 2013 as recycling is another strategy that recycles aerated as or mixed liquor to the inlet of the wwtp headworks thus avoiding the malodorous odor emissions estrada et al 2015 kiesewetter et al 2012 so far as processes were mostly employed as a cost effective alternative to conventional media based odor treatment biosystems due to the lack of performance data and the disagreement upon their effects on wastewater treatment performance however as technologies are gaining increasing attention due to their appreciable merits in odor control a variety of bench scale lebrero et al 2010 moussavi et al 2007 pilot scale barbosa et al 2006a barbosa and stuetz 2013 or even full scale studies kiesewetter et al 2012 vertz et al 2006 have been conducted and the encouraging results confirmed the robustness and efficiency of as systems meanwhile the odor emissions were efficiently treated without compromising the performance of the as process in wastewater treatment barbosa et al 2004 moussavi et al 2007 a number of attempts barbosa et al 2002b estrada et al 2011 2015 kiesewetter et al 2012 lebrero et al 2010 2011 have studied the basics performance design and operating issues as well as other experiences of as biotechnologies in odor control the potentials of as biotechnologies have been well accepted nonetheless the deodorization principles and characteristics of such processes are not systematically interpreted while in depth discussions on the underlying mechanisms of as aided deodorization process are still lacking aghayani et al 2019 pang et al 2017 currently there are a number reviews focusing on odor removal barbusinski et al 2017 jiang et al 2017 in which odor production and emissions characteristics as well as odor treatment methods are systematically summarized and compared their efforts in ranking the complicated odorants or comparing the biological methods are of great importance for the design and optimization of odor treatment and control measures however these efforts are mainly placed on reviewing the odor characteristics or the well developed processing technologies our current review thus aims to pay more attention to the advances and potentials of the emerging as processes in odor abatement so far as technologies for odor treatment have been discussed more broadly than before in technical forums while some significant progress coupled with meaningful discoveries were recently reported to unravel microbial metabolic pathways and characteristics therefore this review is conducted to summarize and critically discuss the approaches and advances of as based biotechnologies in which the findings of chemical and biochemical deodorization mechanisms recently discovered are updated on this basis the promising areas of future research and the associated challenges in the development of as biotechnologies are specially outlined it is expected to improve our understanding on the as deodorization applications and provide an updated guideline for the simultaneous treatment of odor and wastewater in wwtps 2 odor emissions from wastewater treatment processes 2 1 odor emission sources odors emitted in wwtps regardless of the emission zone are mainly produced during anaerobic processes gebicki et al 2016 the sources can be broadly classified as two categories i sewer generations owing to direct chemical discharge or by products derived from anaerobic decomposition of biodegradable materials occurring in sewer networks ii odor emissions in wwtps derived from treatment units and handling facilities of wastewater treatment or excess sludge processing and management jiang et al 2017 muñoz et al 2010 odors generated in sewer networks are emitted mainly in preprocessing units of wwtps fig 1 such as bar screens grit chamber and primary sedimentation tanks psts other locations of intense odor emissions are typically identified as sludge processing e g sludge digestion thickening dewatering and storage units jiang et al 2017 in contrast the odor concentrations in biological treatment units aerobic anoxic tanks and secondary sedimentation are much lower although their emissions may be relatively high carrera chapela et al 2014 thus preprocessing units and sludge handling and pumping facilities entail severe risks in wwtps 2 2 odor characteristics odors in wwtps are typically volatile malodorous compounds with very low olfactory threshold values jiang et al 2017 they are partially involved in the formation of photochemical smog and secondary particulate contaminants in the atmosphere ren et al 2019 the direct effects of odor emissions on people are causing annoyance while other odor induced symptoms may include headache nausea eye irritation respiratory problems vomiting physical disorders etc barbusinski et al 2017 gebicki et al 2016 odorant components are diverse due to the variations in inlet wastewater property wastewater treatment process and sludge management lewkowska et al 2016 even though odorous compounds are generally composed of volatile sulfur compounds vscs such as h2s carbon disulfide diethyl sulfides dimethyl sulfides methanethiol and other mercaptans nitrogen compounds such as nh3 amines amides and indoles and volatile organic compounds vocs such as aromatic aliphatic and halogenated hydrocarbons and volatile fatty acids vfas barbusinski et al 2017 muñoz et al 2010 in particular odor molecules are small unpleasant compounds with a relatively low molecular weight 30 150 g mol but pungent smell karageorgos et al 2010 among the odorous compounds h2s a flammable poisonous and colorless gas with a characteristic smell of rotten eggs is the most frequently reported as a key odorant h2s is either generated from the reduction of sulfate by sulfate reducing microorganisms or the anaerobic decomposition of sulfur containing organics in the wastewater and sludge processing h2s has been traditionally used as an indicator to evaluate the odor treatment performance wang et al 2014 however other odor components such as vscs nh3 volatile fatty acids and amines deserve equal attention when comprehensive risk assessment is required 3 as based processes for odor control in wwtps the deodorization by as processes in wwtps can be achieved through two approaches i prevention of the odorant formation or evaporation into the air and ii collection and treatment of the odors that are produced in the facilities specially from the viewpoint of wwtps applying a prevention plan for wastewater pre treatment or reducing the amount of odor causing compounds produced at the sources are both regarded as prevention measures 3 1 odor prevention 3 1 1 as recycling in wwtps as recycling is a preventative strategy to mitigate odor production and release which is implemented by recycling settled as or mixed liquor from secondary clarifiers or aerobic bioreactors to the inlet of the wwtp headworks fig 2 this method is specially operative for odor prevention in primary sewer processing units e g bar screens filters grit chamber pumping stations and psts which are major odor sources in wwtps jiang et al 2017 odors of untreated wastewater are produced by anaerobic decomposition of biodegradable organics the recycled as from the aeration basin or the secondary settler however creates an anoxic or oxidized environment unsuitable for odor production both as microorganisms and the electron acceptors dissolved oxygen do and nitrate are transferred in as recycling the electron acceptors in the recycled as or mixed liquor can enhance the oxidation of the odorants or the malodorous compound precursors through chemical or microbiological processes kiesewetter et al 2012 the activities of nitrate reducing sulfide oxidizing bacteria nr sob for example can be significantly promoted liang et al 2016 resulting in improved sulfide removal as an odor prevention technology as recycling possesses many merits firstly as recycling represents a fairly cost effective solution to odor control at the primary processing units before biological treatment as recycling requires no construction of extra dedicated facilities and minor additional pipework pump to transfer mixed liquor or as to the inlet works is needed facilities such as the covers of the inlet works and the associated odor collection line are possibly avoided also the operational complexity of as recycling is considered extremely low when compared to other conventional odor control technologies moreover as usually exhibits high biological diversity and thus is able to adsorb and biologically oxidize a variety of odorous compounds such as h2s mercaptans aldehydes amines indoles and vfas estrada et al 2015 as recycling is a relatively new deodorization technology which is not widely investigated and applied based on a lab scale reactor zhang et al 2011 investigated the effects of dosing waste as on the soluble sulfide reduction in raw sewage in which a removal rate of 99 was achieved 0 1 mg l when an iron rich aerated waste as to sewage ratio v v of 16 was applied notably the removal of cod and nitrogen was not impacted short term pilot tests using the as recycling strategy at southern region water reclamation facility palm beach florida were found to achieve around 50 decrease of overall odor emissions harrison et al 2008 two full scale applications of as recycling for odor control also received positive results in the reduction of h2s e g 42 7 vs 3 2 ppm for raw and end concentrations and other sewer gas concentrations e g 0 123 vs 0 0046 ppm for raw and end methyl mercaptan concentrations in which only minor operating issues due to clogging in the valve were reported kiesewetter et al 2012 koetter et al 2014 another trial conducted in lee county wwtp lee county florida indicated better reductions of h2s gas ranging from 87 to 98 whereas grit settling properties within the grit chamber were negatively impacted schmidt et al 2014 a design with limited amount of recycled as was developed to minimize its adverse effects on grit removal during the long term operation 3 1 2 microaeration in as digester as mentioned in section 2 1 sludge processing units in wwtps are an important source of odor emissions e g h2s mainly due to the biogas production in anaerobic digestion ad process of sludge air or oxygen exposure to the ad system is traditionally avoided due to its adverse effects on the growth and activity of obligate anaerobes however recent advances in microaeration technology indicate its diverse beneficial effects on ad process such as scavenging h2s enhancing hydrolysis and stabilizing the process when a small amount of air oxygen is injected into the system nguyen and khanal 2018 the main mechanism of microaeration is to promote the growth of sulfide oxidizing microorganisms so that sulfur is formed as a result of well configured desulfurization process kobayashi et al 2012 in particular an oxidation reduction potential orp in the range of 0 to 300 mv is recommended to maintain the microaerobic condition in the aqueous media of digesters nguyen and khanal 2018 microaeration has gained growing attention in the odor prevention of as processing facilities due to its efficient simple and economic properties moderate aeration in the anaerobic treatment can achieve simultaneous h2s removal and ad preservation as shown in fig 3 microaeration can be realized by dosing air oxygen either in the liquid or gaseous phases while the biogas or liquid is recirculated krayzelova et al 2015 according to previous investigations dosing air in the headspace while maintaining a liquid recirculation is frequently used díaz et al 2011 muñoz et al 2015 since the desulfurization of the biogas occurred inside the ad digester and sometimes mainly in reactor headspace sulfur will clog on the walls and pipes and an extra periodic cleaning operation is thus required kobayashi et al 2012 ramos et al 2014 additionally microaeration may have a potential drawback of resulting in lower methane production due to excessive consumption of soluble substrate and the toxicity of oxygen to methanogens especially when the digesters were in unbalanced conditions krayzelova et al 2015 considerable lab scale studies reported the efficiency of microaeration in the removal of h2s and examined the impacts of reactor configuration the amount and flow rate of air oxygen dosing point mixing method the location of oxidation process ph temperature as well as biogas residence time on reactor performance krayzelova et al 2015 nguyen and khanal 2018 these studies have significantly contributed to the knowledge of process stability control and performance optimization advanced further field tests and full scale applications during the ad investigation of two pilot plant reactors fdz polanco et al 2009 successfully achieved an h2s removal efficiency of above 99 in biogas e g 9318 vs 51 ppm after micoareation the reactor performance in terms of biogas production methane yield and cod removal was not affected in another pilot study ramos and fdz polanco 2014 examined the use of biogas production and h2s concentration as indicators to regulate the oxygen supply to the reactors díaz et al 2015 also evaluated three microaerobic treatment alternatives to fecl3 dosing in full scale sludge digesters and the most profitable one was the injection of concentrated o2 besides the desulfurization efficiency of above 99 was achieved 7580 vs 72 mg m3 through microaeration in a full scale municipal wwtp of central europe jeníček et al 2017 the degradability of cod and volatile suspended solids proved to be enhanced 3 1 3 application potentials as based odor prevention technologies based on as recycling and microaeration both showed great potentials in the odor management systems of wwtps in particular they tackle odors from different sources of the plant as recycling is effective mainly in the wastewater treatment line to reduce or prevent odor emissions from headworks and primary distribution structures such as filters grit chambers and psts microaeration deals with odors in the sludge processing and management line such as sludge digestion dewatering and storage facilities both of the strategies utilized the addition of oxidizing agent oxygen or nitrate and the introduction of active microorganisms to counter the anaerobic decomposition of odorous compounds estrada et al 2015 nguyen and khanal 2018 in the ad system only the oxygen is properly provided as diverse microorganisms already exist in the sludge while in as recycling both the oxidizing agents and microorganisms are supplemented the featured characteristics of as recycling and microaeration are that the investment and operating expenditure along with the operational complexity are extremely low while the overall efficiency is appreciable kiesewetter et al 2012 krayzelova et al 2015 the prevention strategies are even more cost effective than as diffusion as no additional covers pipelines and corrosion protection materials are required microaeration is also correlated with improved hydrolysis of as reduced vfa yield peaks better ph control better sludge quality and system robustness of ad process krayzelova et al 2015 these benefits demonstrate their high potentials to prevent malodorous emissions from wwtps on the other hand concerns needed to be considered and properly addressed while implementing these technologies the operations of as recycling actually combine the traditional primary and secondary wastewater treatment into one as based biological treatment process therefore its effect on screens filters grit chamber psts as well as the established nitrogen phosphate removal needs to be further examined the recycled sludge can increase the hydraulic capacity of wwtps enlarge the workload of the screens filters for solids filtering and may induce the deterioration of the sludge settling properties in psts moreover as recycling can consume the readily biodegradable organics and adversely affect the subsequent performance of biological phosphorus and nitrogen removal especially for wastewater with insufficient carbon source similarly the application of microaeration in the ad process also needs to cope with issues like the oxygen toxicity to methanogens explosion risks of methane oxygen mixtures clogging the walls and pipes excessive soluble carbon consumption etc 3 2 end of pipe odor removal end of pipe odor removal in wwtps is mainly based on covering and extracting foul air from odor production units and treating the gas with specialized biological processes prior to their atmospheric discharge media based systems such as biofilters biotrickling filters and bioscrubbers rely on the inert packings to increase mass transfer mudliar et al 2010 although they commonly employ as as inoculum during the start up estrada et al 2015 these processes are typically independent of wastewater processing units and the associated discussions can be found elsewhere barbusinski et al 2017 mudliar et al 2010 as based technologies for odor treatment discussed below are liquid based systems i e as diffusion which can be incorporated in the wwtp facilities to realize the integrated treatment of odor and wastewater 3 2 1 as diffusion as diffusion which sparges the collected odor emissions into aeration tanks of wwtps is a typical liquid based odor control system using existed as for biodegradation of odorous compounds fig 4 foul air is collected from covered or contained process units and transferred via blowers through a delivery pipework system to submerged coarse or fine bubble diffusers in the as aeration tank the odorous air bubbles are diffused into the mixed liquor together with oxygen where the mechanisms responsible for odor abatement include absorption by the aqueous liquor and as flocs adsorption e g high molecular compounds with low solubility adsorb onto as flocs or condensation e g vocs transferring from relatively warm air into the cooler mixed liquor will condense of odorous compounds and biodegradation by aerobic microorganisms aghayani et al 2019 bowker 2000 lebrero et al 2011 as diffusion has been firstly practiced at wwtps for odor mitigation in united states of america and then adopted in europe since the 1990s while positive results were routinely reported barbosa et al 2006a bowker 2000 kiesewetter et al 2012 currently as diffusion is mainly used as an alternative to media based systems such as biofilters biotrickling filters and bioscrubbers in odor treatment however in terms of various odorant treatment as systems possess the merits of their biological counterparts environmentally friendliness low operating cost and high odor removal efficiency while overcoming most of their major limitations media plugging biomass accumulation ph and moisture control or accumulation of biodegradation metabolites etc aghayani et al 2019 barbosa et al 2002b lebrero et al 2011 for example biotreatment of gases containing chlorinated odorants sulfur compounds or nh3 by biofilters results in accumulation of chloride sulfate or nitrate ions and subsequent acidification of the biofilter moreover the surface area of small air bubbles in as diffusion is larger than that of the thin layer within the porous media of biofilter and biotrickling filter systems barbosa et al 2002b besides the as diffusion technology is especially advantageous in plants with diffusion based aeration systems but having space limitations since only low expenditure such as the addition of pipework protective coatings of aeration blowers and moisture traps are needed bowker 2000 ren et al 2019 most lab investigations of as diffusion received appreciable results moussavi et al 2007 observed high h2s removal efficiencies 94 from a bench scale as system in which the cod reduction was not significantly affected even the inlet h2s concentrations increased to 50 ppm 3 ppm at outlet the adverse effect was that the settling ability of sludge deteriorated however blonda et al 2006 observed similar h2s removal efficiencies 94 while sludge settleability as well as cod removal nitrification and denitrification did not show any response in addition no relevant effects of sulfur compounds on microbial biochemical activity and composition were observed blonda et al 2018 in an as diffusion bioreactor treating synthetic malodorous emissions containing h2s toluene butanone and alpha pinene no clear positive or negative relationship between community characteristics and bioreactor functions was observed under various operating conditions as well rodriguez et al 2017 as diffusion was also compared with biofilter for the treatment of h2s and vocs lebrero et al 2010 2011 the results indicated that as diffusion exhibited a higher robustness towards fluctuations maintained low outlet h2s concentration 1 4 mg m3 while over 95 of butanone 0 34 mg m3 and toluene 0 028 mg m3 was removed the successful applications of as diffusion were also demonstrated through field tests and full scale experience the removal efficiencies of toluene p xylene and dichloromethane dcm in a pilot scale as basin were investigated under various influent voc concentrations liquid depths and air application rates chou and chang 2005 the designed gas treatment reactor achieved 85 removal of vocs toluene and p xylene and 95 removal for dcm in 1 m deep aerated liquid hardy et al 2001 investigated the removal efficiencies of h2s with typical wwtp concentrations 5 ppm in a pilot plant 300 l volume results indicated that h2s removal efficiencies of 98 were consistently achieved without compromising the performance of wastewater treatment process despite that nitrification was interrupted briefly at the start up of h2s diffusion similar high removal rates of h2s was also reported in other pilot scale as diffusion systems while no significant change in filamentous organisms and major effluent indexes e g cod and ammonium were observed barbosa et al 2002a 2004 the performance of as diffusion at high h2s concentrations e g 150 ppmv were evaluated in pilots scale trials and removal rates of 100 or around were obtained for all inlet concentrations barbosa et al 2006a barbosa and stuetz 2013 similarly over 99 9 of h2s removal was observed in two regional full scale wwtps of texas usa when the foul air with an average inlet h2s concentration of 70 or 50 ppmv were collected from various sources of the plant vertz et al 2006 3 2 2 application potentials when odor preventive measures are insufficient to mitigate odor emissions end of the pipe odor abatement technologies must be applied as a liquid based system as diffusion is featured with high odor removal efficiency coupled with low investment and operating expenses as diffusion can be used as a dual role system to achieve integrated odor control and wastewater treatment however the widespread implementation of as diffusion is hampered by the lack of full scale data concerning its performance during the treatment of odorous vocs and the lack of knowledge on the ability of as systems to cope with process fluctuations and operational failures barbosa and stuetz 2013 bowker 2000 rodriguez et al 2017 other issues of as diffusion may include nitrification inhibition reduction of as settling efficiency possible adverse effects on wastewater treatment corrosion of pipes blower and other equipment although they could be overcome by biomass acclimation as well as proper design and operation practices barbosa et al 2002b kiesewetter et al 2012 according to the operation principle of as diffusion the mass transfer e g hydrophobic vocs and biodegradation are two main steps limiting the removal of the target contaminants patel et al 2017 on this basis aghayani et al 2019 achieved improved biodegradation of toluene vapors in the as diffusion process by inserting moving media along with stimulation of biosurfactant producing bacteria by h2o2 this system is also promising for efficient biodegradation and mineralization of aromatic hydrocarbons of odor yan et al 2016 also reported in situ enhanced deodorization nh3 h2s dimethyl sulfide and dimethyl disulfide in an a2o wastewater treatment system by adding humus soil to stimulate functional bacteria due to the high deodorization potential of as and the diverse merits of as diffusion as diffusion is highly worth considering as partial or overall odor control strategies in wwtps in general the selection of the precautionary and end of the pipe odor treatment technology in each specific wwtp depends on the characteristics concentration and properties of odorants the level of efficiency required the type of odor sources etc odor control involves a combination of odor processing via efficient design and operation practices of certain technology as well as odor containment via the installation of process covers the three as technologies i e as recycling microaeration and as diffusion for odor control all possess their distinctive benefits as well as specific issues in deodorization applications however these issues will be gradually addressed or controlled to an acceptable level since increasing studies in field trials have examined the design issues and operating parameters of as application in odor abatement meanwhile mechanism based studies have attempted to systematically elucidate odor transformation and elimination behaviors from microscopic and microbiological views 4 deodorization mechanisms in as processes of wwtps the odor nh3 is highly soluble in water thus it can be easily absorbed into aqueous as system and transformed into nitrite and nitrate through microbial nitrification process reduced sulfur compound h2s is typically considered to be a dominant contributor of odor emission in wwtps pang et al 2017 wang et al 2014 in certain circumstances odor abatement effectiveness can be at least partially represented by the measurement of h2s concentration coupled with other characteristic odors this review thus mainly focuses on the mechanism and characteristics of sulfur related odor control and wastewater treatment 4 1 h2s production and polysulfide as mentioned in section 2 2 h2s is anaerobically generated either from sulfate reduction or the decomposition of organic sulfur compounds in the wastewater and sludge digestion process the addition of nitrate is commonly employed as an effective approach to mitigate h2s production in sewer systems the main mechanism is by utilizing nr sob to biologically oxidize sulfide to elemental sulfur or sulfate liang et al 2016 lin et al 2018 as described in eqs 1 and 2 1 s 2 0 4 n o 3 2 4 h s 0 0 2 n 2 1 2 h 2 o δ g 0 191 0 kj 2 s 0 1 2 n o 3 0 4 h 2 o s o 4 2 0 6 n 2 0 8 h δ g 0 547 6 kj however the quick rebound of sulfide concentration after nitrate depletion was observed and resulted in more serious odor and corrosion problems in downstream wwtps jiang et al 2013 liang et al 2016 investigated the mechanism of sulfide regeneration in a laboratory scale sewer reactor and proved indirect sulfur reduction via polysulfide was the key path for the quick rebound of sulfide concentration the reactive polysulfide sn 2 is formed either abiotically or microbially through the reaction of elemental sulfur with sulfide in which the s8 ring of elemental sulfur is cleaved by a nucleophilic attack of the hs anion eq 3 rabus et al 2013 3 hs n 1 s 0 s n 2 h as illustrated by fig 5 polysulfide is the key intermediate for indirect sulfur reduction that enables the elemental sulfur to dissolve in the aqueous phase and enhances its bioavailability for sulfur reducing microorganisms in the presence of nitrate the sulfide in the sewer was chemically and biologically oxidized into major product elemental sulfur and was further deposited in sewer sediment and biofilm jiang et al 2013 after the nitrate depletion polysulfide formed by elemental sulfur and sulfide and was further utilized by sulfur reducers to enhance the sulfur reduction rate resulting in the quick increase of sulfide concentration the sulfide produced will in turn promote polysulfide formation thus achieving a high rate sulfur reduction through a polysulfide involved self accelerating way zhang et al 2018 notably sulfur coming from upstream can accumulate and be reduced quickly in such conditions and cause more serious odor and corrosion problems in the downstream sewer the direct sulfur reduction in fig 5 is a slow process and would not induce serious sulfide regeneration in sewer systems the finding that polysulfide is the key intermediate for accelerating sulfur reduction provides constructive guidance for the application of as recycling in the odor prevention of wwtps effective sulfide elimination always involves the efficient control of the intermediate polysulfide formation which can be achieved through the addition of iron salts batch tests of liang et al 2016 revealed that when polysulfide formation was prevented by the ferrous chloride addition the sulfur reduction rate remarkably decreased from 12 8 to 1 8 mgs l h this may partially explain the excellent sulfide control results of zhang et al 2011 and ge et al 2013 using iron salt as additives 4 2 sulfide elimination by nitrate and oxygen 4 2 1 chemical and biological oxidation oxygen and nitrate are the two most common electron acceptors in the as system responsible for sulfide oxidation and odor removal specially nitrate was main electron acceptor 6 10 mg l after the oxygen depletion 2 3 mg l only in as recycling practices estrada et al 2015 a series of chemical and biochemical reactions occur in complex as system during sulfide oxidation the chemical auto oxidation of sulfide by oxygen can yield elemental sulfur s0 sulfite so3 2 thiosulfate s2o3 2 sulfate so4 2 or other sulfur species depending on the sulfide concentration and specific environmental conditions lin et al 2018 on the other hand biological sulfide oxidation is accomplished by the activities of chemolithotrophic sulfide and sulfur oxidizing bacteria sob specifically nr sob utilize electron acceptor nitrate to remove sulfide eq 1 and 2 while other sob can resort to oxygen for sulfide oxidation through biochemical pathways revealed in eqs 4 6 guo et al 2019a ramos et al 2013 4 h 2 s 0 5 o 2 s 0 h 2 o δ g 0 209 4 kj 5 s 0 1 5 o 2 s o 4 2 2 h δ g 0 587 1 kj 6 h 2 s 2 o 2 s o 4 2 2 h δ g 0 798 2 kj 4 2 2 biochemical interactions and microscopic mechanisms the biochemical interactions and mechanisms of nitrate induced sulfide removal in wwtps always involved the simultaneous biological removal of elements nitrogen sulfur carbon which was termed as denitrifying sulfide removal dsr process as shown in fig 6 both autotrophic and heterotrophic denitrifiers are actively involved in the dsr process at the presence of nitrate sulfide can be partially oxidized into elemental sulfur by autotrophic denitrifiers lin et al 2018 which deposits in the biofilms or sediments meanwhile nitrate can be removed by converting nitrate into nitrogen through both autotrophic and heterotrophic denitrifiers in an anaerobic or anoxic environment qian et al 2017 heterotrophic denitrifiers will metabolize the available organic carbon source malodorous odorants and their precursors in sewer included into inorganic carbon resulting in their removal from the system interestingly during the sulfide oxidation process the bioavailable compounds of sn 2 and or elemental s0 poly s proved to be stored in microbial cells guo et al 2017 wu et al 2014 further investigations by guo et al 2019b indicated that the co existence of sn 2 s0 as poly s could be stored either intracellularly or extracellularly by microorganisms the storage states and the dynamic conversions between s0 sn 2 and other sulfur species were for the first time clarified by the integrated chemical analysis and raman micro spectroscopy rms coupled with multiple microscopic methods the research further implied there might be a universal pool of bioavailable sulfur that facilitated their transfer between intermolecular or interspecies guo et al 2019b the adsorption and oxidation mechanism of sulfide in the as process was also examined by pang et al 2017 in which the interaction of as and sulfides was examined by scanning electron microscope energy dispersive spectrometer sem eds test and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps test the sem eds results revealed that removed sulfur in aqueous solution was fixed in as while an oxidation state of 2 for fixed sulfur was observed in the xps analysis fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir analysis demonstrated one of the radical groups bonding sulfides on as was the primary amine group r nh2 it was concluded that sulfides removal by as was primarily attributed to adsorption rather than biodegradation within 40 min the adsorption was an endothermic process and chemical sorption or ion exchange process was the main adsorption mechanism it is noteworthy that hydraulic retention time hrt in the as system for wastewater treatment is usually hours which allows sufficient degradation of sulfide and other malodorous organics overall the recent advances in microscopic mechanisms of sulfide adsorption and biochemical conversion have significantly enriched our knowledge on the sulfide metabolic pathways in as 4 2 3 sulfur recovery mechanisms as stated by guo et al 2019b poly s could be stored either intracellularly or extracellularly by microorganisms in the desulfurization process the sulfur particles produced by sob are attached with a composite charged layer that primarily contains polysulfides and polyorganics cai et al 2017 sposob et al 2017 which can be readily utilized by sulfur reducing microorganisms to produce sulfide and generate h2s emissions thus sulfur recovery in wwtps despite its possible use as a resource in agriculture and industrial activities e g fertilizer and other raw materials manufacturing is also an important step in preventing further odor emissions lin et al 2018 biologically produced sulfur either in granular or filamentous shape is very different from ordinary elemental sulfur cai et al 2017 in most cases the charged sulfur particles are hydrophilic and bioavailable mutually repel each other and exist in colloidal forms to separate the biosulfur feng et al 2018 investigated the sulfur recovery mechanism in an internal airlift loop reactor with the aid of flocculant producer pseudomonas sp strain n1 2 and ca2 coagulant as indicated in fig 7 the stable colloidal s0 enriched in co bond po band nh groups and other functional groups of acids alcohols and proteins polysaccharides ftir results the biosulfur product did not settle naturally forming milky white suspensions in the water sample the strain pseudomonas sp present in as was able to utilize organics and generate flocculants such as extracellular polymeric substance eps which destroyed the colloidal sulfur stable state and facilitated sulfur sedimentation with the aid of ca2 coagulant the biosulfur product was neutralized in charge attached to the coagulant molecule and finally combined with eps to generate bioflocculant s0 sem analysis showed that the surface of the flocculated sulfur was smooth while the reticular organics attached on s0 polysaccharides and proteins had irregular shape and rough surface the interlaced three dimensional network structure is believed to facilitate subsequent flocculation sedimentation and other sulfur recovery practices chen et al 2016 4 3 sulfur involved integrated odor and wastewater treatment 4 3 1 simultaneous removal of nitrogen sulfur and carbon one of the merits of as recycling in deodorization is that it can result in simultaneous removal of nitrogen sulfur and carbon in wastewater treatment practices after the depletion of electron acceptor oxygen small amounts in the recycled as nitrogen was utilized for deodorization studies achieving the simultaneous nitrogen sulfur and carbon removal by dsr process were widely reported factors ph temperature variations in sulfur species and organics exerted various influence on the sulfur species transformations as well as the denitratation and denitritation process qian et al 2017 sposob et al 2017 interestingly as revealed by a laboratory scale study of yang et al 2016 extra decreases in n2o emissions were observed during the sulfide driven autotrophic denitrification process in the granular sludge reactor in addition a typical facultative strain pseudomonas sp c27 capable of conducting mixotrophic dsr reactions using both organic matters and sulfide as electron donors was employed to examine the metabolic mechanism in the dsr process guo et al 2014a quantitative proteomic analysis revealed a new pathway from acetate to pyruvate with coupled sulfur and nitrogen cycles and the newly proposed coupled cycles pathway under excess carbon supply was discussed and slightly modified guo et al 2015 these studies indirectly indicated the feasibility of as recycling in simultaneous nitrogen sulfur carbon removal and pinpointed the internal mechanism of nitrate dominated deodorization apart from nitrate trace oxygen in as can also stimulate microorganism activities and effectively reduce sulfide levels thus facilitating the odor prevention process fig 6 in a simultaneous sulfide and nitrate removal reactor wang et al 2015b adopted 0 1 0 3 mg l of do and improved the efficiencies of s0 regeneration sulfide oxidation and nitrate reduction the micro aerobic condition resulted in the sulfide and nitrate removal efficiency of 100 and 90 respectively the micro aerobic enhancement for dsr at high carbon to nitrogen ratios was also examined by chen et al 2017 the reactor achieved 100 sulfide removal with 5 sulfide was removed by chemical oxidation pathway moreover metabolic studies were conducted focusing on specific strains penibacillus sp and aneurinibacillus aneurinilyticus chen et al 2010 and the associated proteomic analysis of mixotrophic sob pseudomonas sp c27 was used to reveal the underlying microbial mechanism for sulfur nitrogen carbon removal guo et al 2014b microaerobic conditions increased the rates of protein synthesis e g sulfide oxidase and cell growth which enhanced cell defensive system the nitrogen and oxygen involved sulfide removal studies have provided valuable guidance for wwtp deodorization before the assessment design and operation practices of as recycling 4 3 2 sulfur cycle enhanced biological phosphorus removal the municipal wastewater of coastal cities contains a significant concentration of sulfate around 50 500 mg s so4 l which originated from various sources liu et al 2016 under anaerobic anoxic conditions sulfate can be reduced to sulfide and contributes to odor emissions additionally the accumulated toxic sulfide can damage wastewater transport systems and hinder microbial processes in wwtps such as the conventional enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr this is linked to the fact that the functional polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos are sensitive to high sulfate reduction wu et al 2018 to overcome this limitation a novel limited oxygen sulfur cycle associated ebpr los ebpr process was developed for p removal which was further modified to denitrifying sulfur cycle associated ebpr ds ebpr system due to the low oxygen transfer rate wu et al 2014 in this novel anaerobic anoxic ds ebpr system denitrifying paos was used for simultaneous anoxic p uptake and anaerobic denitrification accompanied by p release guo et al 2019a 2019b during the anaerobic phase of the ds ebpr system fig 8 both sulfate reducing bacteria srb and sob take up the vfas for sulfate reduction to form poly s in srb and synthesize polyhydroxyalkanoates pha in sob respectively at the same time sob release p from the cleavage of poly p accompanied by glycogen degradation and poly s ingestion from srb during the subsequent anoxic phase sob oxidize intracellular pha and poly s using the electron acceptor nitrate for energy and biomass production glycogen replenishment sulfate production p uptake and poly p storage in this stage nitrate and phosphate in wastewater are simultaneously removed through the synergistic interaction of srb and sob the mechanism has greatly enhanced the understanding of ds ebpr process although issues such as the internal polymer transfer and conversions the full metabolic pathways of srb and sob are yet to be revealed guo et al 2016 2019a the system will guide deodorization as recycling applications in wwtps of coastal cities receiving sulfate laden wastewater 4 4 removal of vocs vocs are important components of odor emissions from wwtps featured with low water solubility high persistence and toxicity the performance of voc treatment was usually determined by the limited mass transfer from gaseous phase to aqueous phase rather than by the biodegradation process patel et al 2017 the performance data on the vocs treatment by as process as well as the associated biological mechanism studies are not widely reported generally the control of vocs emissions in as systems can be enhanced by increasing active biomass concentration hydraulic retention time and oxygen transfer efficiency using fine diffusers or by the addition of surfactant and suspended carrier aghayani et al 2019 fallah et al 2010 hsieh 2000 padalkar and kumar 2018 temperature variations also affect henry s law constants for vocs and their subsequent removal lin and chou 2006 aghayani et al 2019 used acclimated biomass pseudomonas spp and bacillus spp mixture capable of in situ biosurfactant generation to improve toluene bioavailability and inserted moving media into the as system to increase the gas liquid contact surface hydrogen peroxide h2o2 was added to stimulate the production of oxidative enzyme peroxidase which can efficiently catalyze the carbon carbon bond cleavage reactions in the toluene structure and generate more biodegradable intermediates moussavi et al 2017 moreover h2o2 addition also stimulated the microbial biosurfactant production and further enhanced the gas to liquid mass transfer of toluene since the mass transfer of vocs from air to water is closely associated with the cell surface characteristics of microorganisms filamentous fungi with large specific surface area in its mycelium and better adaptabilities under undesirable conditions dry weak acid etc have attracted increasing attention cheng et al 2019 vergara fernández et al 2016 the differences of cell surface characteristics between the bacterium pseudomonas veronii and fungus ophiostoma stenoceras was investigated by cheng et al 2019 and the fungus exhibited better performance in capturing and adsorbing organic compounds in liquid and gas phases the adsorption mechanisms of hydrophobic vocs indicated the langmuir model representing physical monolayer adsorption dominated in the process the xps characterization and ftir analysis further confirmed that several functional groups co c o op etc and hydrocarbon like compounds chc in the surface of the fungal cells were crucial for adsorption the addition of ophiostoma stenoceras into the bacterial system reduced the time taken for complete degradation of hexane tetrahydrofuran and chlorobenzene because fungal hypha provided better micro environment for the nutrient transport and gaseous substrate diffusion to bacteria vergara fernández et al 2016 4 5 functional microorganisms 4 5 1 sob in aqueous deodorization systems sob are the main groups involved in sulfide oxidation and deodorization under aerobic as diffusion microaerobic microaeration in digester or denitrifying as systems as recycling due to their oxidation potential of reduced inorganic sulfur species such as sulfide and thiosulfate guo et al 2019a biological removal of sulfides is based on the activities of photoautotrophic or chemolithotrophic sob photoautotrophic sob obtain energy from light while chemolithotrophic sob obtain energy from biochemical reactions using oxygen aerobic species or nitrate and nitrite anaerobic species thus chemolithotrophic sob are technologically more suitable for the biological removal of sulfides in as systems due to their flexibility in environmental adaptation and high sulfide tolerance lin et al 2018 table 1 summarized the functional sob in aqueous as systems for sulfide oxidation or simultaneous h2s and wastewater treatment the most cited sob species were thiobacillus species which were short rod shaped microorganisms reported both in anaerobic and aerobic systems krayzelova et al 2015 the species belonging to genera arcobacter paracoccus and sulfurimonas were also found in microaerobic or denitrifying conditions kobayashi et al 2012 wu et al 2018 yu et al 2014 another group of sob which are morphologically and taxonomically distinct contain long filamentous bacteria beggiatoa and thiothrix species pokorna and zabranska 2015 interestingly pseudomonas stutzeri qz1 paracoccus denitrificans and some species of thiobacillus and beggiatoa are typical examples of facultative chemolithotrophic sob that can grow either autotrophically or heterotrophically krayzelova et al 2015 mahmood et al 2009 in the dsr process huang et al 2015a investigated microbial community structure under different sulfide nitrate loading ratios the results indicated that in the optimized s2 no3 ratio of 5 6 sob species such as thauera and thiobacillus predominated and the sulfide quinone reductase sqr gene was highly expressed in sulfide oxidation process with the increased loading of nitrate the nirk gene encoding the copper containing nitrite reductase increased which confirmed the nitrate reduction process correspondingly the soxb gene encoding soxb subunit of the sox enzyme system in the oxidization of sulfide elemental sulfur and thiosulfate into sulfate expressed increasingly in an anaerobic baffled reactor with separated sulfate reduction and dsr units huang et al 2015b the adenosine 5 phosphosulfate reductase alpha subunit apra gene expressed by sob sulfurovum sp or acidiferrobacter sp functional for sulfite oxidation dominated in dsr process the sat gene by halothiobacillus neapolitanus encoding sulfate adenosine transferases which oxidizes the acylated sulfite to sulfate and produces atp and sulfuric acid was also reported in sulfide wastewater treatment feng et al 2018 under high sulfide stress sqr sat and cytochrome c3 encoding cytochrome c oxidase for thiosulfate oxidation were observed with increased expressions 4 5 2 other deodorization microorganisms odors emitted from wwtps are a mixture of complex components and are thus removed through a variety of microbial communities microorganisms exhibit various degradation performance in treating specific odorants a pseudomonas sp strain wl2 which was isolated from the as of a pharmaceutical wastewater plant could efficiently metabolize ethyl mercaptan into diethyl disulfide wang et al 2015a in a microbial community isolated from as estrada et al 2012b found some species of the genus acinetobacter proved to be fast growing bacteria capable of growing at high toluene concentrations on the other hand the slow growing microorganisms belonging to the genera pseudonocardia mycobacterium nitrospira and members of the orders rhodocyclales and rhodospirillales are also able to degrade toluene at low concentrations toluene can also be captured and degraded when it was sparged into the aqueous culture media of pseudomonas putida in an external loop airlift bioreactor harding et al 2003 with the successful operation of the reactor the continuous sparging of toluene contaminated air finally reached a removal efficiency of 100 additionally the genera rhizobium pseudomonas burkholderia rhodobacter gemmobacter chitinophaga vampirovibrio fodinicurvata hyphomicrobium mycobacterium xanthobacter in aqueous systems were reported as dichloromethane toluene or other voc degraders as well dobslaw and engesser 2015 wu et al 2017 xu et al 2019 in an as diffusion system by rodriguez et al 2017 microbial community changes under different operational parameters were examined in the treatment of a synthetic malodorous emission containing h2s toluene butanone and alpha pinene although functional bacteria such as bacterial genera nitrospira rhodanobacter comamonas as well as fusarium and chaetothyriales like fungi were detected no clear positive or negative relationship between community characteristics and bioreactor functions was observed instead evenness and community dynamics seemed to play a role in maintaining reactor stability the inoculated alpha pinene degrader pseudomonas fluorescens was likely outcompeted by the microorganisms already adapted to the as environment it is implied that the as system in wwtps contains a variety of functional microorganisms that are responsible for the wastewater treatment as well as the odorous compound removal 5 trends and future directions of as processes for odor control despite of the great advances made and the promising aspects keeping the emerging as technologies at the core of interest there are still several challenges ahead before they become well established biological deodorization processes in this section several aspects are proposed to advance further research or engineering based exploration activities 5 1 enhancement of current as based processes 5 1 1 in depth investigations of the operational issues the as based processes discussed above are all cost effective odor control approaches nevertheless the operational issues related to as biotechnologies in odor control should be subject to detailed examination and in depth elucidation for example the sludge type e g anaerobic aerobic or iron dosed sludge showed nonnegligible effect on the as to degrade odors barbosa et al 2002b fisher et al 2018 which could be an interesting future topic long term and or large scale operation of as diffusion is needed to examine its possible adverse effects on wastewater treatment its robustness towards process fluctuations and operational failures as well as the removal efficiency of various vocs specially the effect of filamentous sulfur bacteria on as properties the treatment capacity the energetic biogas production efficiency with oxygen involvement in as processes all deserve further in depth investigations in odor control practices as a unique as treatment system membrane bioreactors mbr combine the membrane separation and biological wastewater treatment process mbr systems eliminate the need for secondary clarifier and allow high concentrations of mlss fallah et al 2010 which is appreciable in as deodorization processes with higher amounts of mlss in mbr systems there is increased as viscosity that can enhance the as adsorption ability towards odorants moreover the abundant functional microorganisms enable the system more efficient in odor degradation and more resistant to process fluctuations and operational failures unfortunately very limited studies tackled this area and there is a lack of knowledge on the as deodorization ability in mbr systems 5 1 2 hybrid technologies robustness analysis revealed that hybrid technologies are more resistant to process fluctuations and operational upsets than sing use technology estrada et al 2012a the combination of as and the addition of chemicals such as iron salt treatment exerted multiple beneficial effects for integrated odor and wastewater ge et al 2013 rebosura et al 2018 meanwhile methane production and other digestion processes were not negatively impacted in a hybrid pilot scale study the ferric iron addition was coupled with biological treatment for efficient h2s removal from biogas and the chemical biological system exhibited great potential for biogas purification and power generation lin et al 2013 the involvement of chemicals e g h2o2 in as systems can promote the mass transfer and biodegradation especially in environments when high levels of sulfide cause toxic effects to microbial cells aghayani et al 2019 therefore due to the great benefits of hybrid technologies in deodorization biogas purification and wastewater treatment the process control mechanism and kinetic investigations of the systems are promising 5 2 further deodorization mechanism investigations 5 2 1 eps odorant interactions eps are natural polymers of high molecular weight secreted from microorganisms attaching to the cell surface which are responsible for sludge aggregation and the removal of pollutants in terms of sulfur recovery in sulfide wastewater treatment organic eps were able to destroy the stable state of colloidal sulfur and facilitate biosulfur sedimentation feng et al 2018 the interaction mechanism of eps and pollutants can include adsorption surface chelation complexation ion exchange precipitation metabolism etc tian et al 2019 thus eps play an important role in the adsorption and subsequent degradation of malodorous compounds and their precursors nevertheless very limited studies so far tackled linking the production structure chemical composition characteristics and roles of eps with deodorization in wwtps their functions and interaction mechanisms with odorants in different as systems are thus should be examined 5 2 2 microscopic and spectroscopic characterization the characteristics of microbial cell surfaces and polymers secreted by microorganisms are key elements to reveal microbial metabolic activities these characteristics have been qualitatively visualized by conventional microscopic methods e g optical or fluorescence microscopes or quantitatively analyzed by ex situ chemical measurements however limited information is available regarding the detailed cell surface functions and biogenic polymer properties such as composition structure charges and storage states guo et al 2019b used raman analysis for the first time unraveled the co existence of s0 sn 2 species either intracellularly or extracellularly stored as poly s in biological sulfur conversions even though both the deodorization mechanisms of typical odors and the biochemical mechanisms in integrated odor and wastewater treatment still deserve to be further examined guo et al 2019a pang et al 2017 microscopic and spectroscopic tools e g sem eds xps ftir rms coupled with other sophisticated instrumental analyses are recommended to reveal as and microbial cell surface characteristics such as the pivotal components functional groups major elements and their oxidation states 5 2 3 microbial community and metabolic analysis the composition distribution and dynamics of microbial communities in odor treatment systems play main roles in maintaining the system functional stability currently research efforts of molecular analysis have mainly been placed on biofilters and biotrickling filters due to their wide application barbusinski et al 2017 nevertheless microbial diversity analysis ecological network analysis and characteristics of functional microorganisms in emerging as deodorization technologies such as as diffusion or as recycling systems have been rarely studied rodriguez et al 2017 for instance biomass can acclimate to odor involvement thus countering nitrification inhibition effects whereas the key microorganisms in this process remain unclear therefore molecular tools are encouraged to reveal the structure and dynamics of microbial communities as well as characteristics and roles of keynote microorganisms in the as deodorization process meanwhile the metabolic pathways of odorants and nitrogen carbon phosphate by as microorganisms should be further clarified through diverse approaches such as gene expression transcriptomic analysis metabolomics analysis proteomic analysis community level physiological profiling clpp and stable isotope labeling 5 2 4 isolation and characterization of functional bacterial strains in most biological systems bacteria in the as play the main role in the transformation and degradation of organic and inorganic compounds as well as odorants introduced into the system the isolation and characterization of functional bacterial strains responsible for odor removal or sulfur recovery can improve our understanding of the bacteria properties barbosa et al 2006b feng et al 2018 pokorna krayzelova et al 2018 conducted batch experiments to study final products and kinetics of biochemical and chemical sulfide oxidation under microaerobic conditions in which a strain of sulfuricurvum kujiense was utilized the exact sulfide transformation pathways and the characteristics of biochemical and chemical sulfide oxidation were revealed thus the behavior sensitivity population dynamics metabolic pathways and pairwise interactions of functional bacterial strains under defined environments deserved to be deliberately studied and compared with microbial consortiums in as systems guo et al 2014b 2015 the meaningful findings will provide reference or instructions for the establishment of efficient as systems in integrated odor and wastewater treatment 5 2 5 model analysis model analysis is a helpful tool of process simulation aimed for better understanding of process performance and underlying mechanisms xu et al 2013 described the sulfate reducing and sulfide oxidizing process using model analysis during the microaerophilic treatment sulfate bearing wastewaters and the associated sulfur recovery studies the developed model helped to better understand the procedure of elemental sulfur formation and identify the importance of s2 s 0 cycles currently although there are a few modeling papers describing microaeration for biogas desulfurization and dsr process donoso bravo et al 2018 xu et al 2016 detailed modeling of as processes in odor control and wastewater treatment is still lacking the model analysis of biochemical and chemical deodorization process as well as the associated microbial pathways under different circumstances remain an important research gap 5 3 further investigations on vocs vocs are major constituents of odors emitted from wwtps and the limited removal ability of hydrophobic vocs are major concerns of some as biotechnologies such as as diffusion so far the removal mechanisms of vocs in the abovementioned as processes remain unclear although research efforts on the removal performance and biodegradation mechanism of vocs in other biological systems have been conducted padalkar and kumar 2018 xu et al 2019 further research efforts such as the involvement of high mlss biosurfactant or biosurfactant generating biomass dedicate mechanical design will enhance the removal performance of vocs in particular volatile organic sulfur compounds are important components of wastewater odor which deserve to be exclusively and comprehensively examined both in mechanism based investigations and field applications 5 4 simultaneous odor and water treatment as processes have the potential of achieving simultaneous odor and wastewater treatment in wwtps as a result of various anthropogenic activities and some natural saltwater intrusion in coastal aquifers wwtps are receiving increased sulfate laden wastewater lin et al 2018 this can cause serious odor and corrosion problem in a sewer system or anaerobic wastewater treatment units liang et al 2016 on the other side it provides an opportunity to combine the treatment of carbon nitrogen sulfate and phosphate in one integrated bioprocess system guo et al 2019a the development of ds ebpr system which successfully exploited the metabolic phases of sob and srb communities was an example of coping with such challenges guo et al 2017 2019b however the metabolic pathways of system functional microorganisms have not been completely unraveled while challenges such as the balance control of the diverse microorganisms and large scale applications of the system still exist other future efforts could also include the development of new feasible integrated as systems for the simultaneous removal of contaminants and recovery of useful nutrients 5 5 synergistic treatment with other air emissions 5 5 1 greenhouse gases wwtps have been regarded as an important contributor to the global greenhouse gas stock and the three major greenhouse gases include n2o co2 and ch4 campos et al 2016 notably n2o has an approximate global warming potential 300 fold stronger than co2 which can be produced during nitrification and denitrification process greenhouse gas emission is becoming one of the key aspects in the overall performance of the wwtps due to its concerns of climate change and air pollution the greenhouse gas emissions can be minimized through modifying the operational conditions or collected and treated by low cost abatement technologies in wwtps however they were mostly treated without considering the simultaneous removal effects of odors especially in the deodorization as processes one of the encouraging preventive measures of greenhouse gas emissions in the next generation of wwtps is to apply partial nitritation anammox processes to remove ammonia campos et al 2016 this approach maximizes the anaerobic pathway for organic matter removal which agrees well with the principles of as recycling for odor control the various synergistic treatment strategies of greenhouse gas and odors are worth considering in the near future 5 5 2 bioaerosols bioaerosol emissions from wwtps have attracted broad attention owing to the concerns of emitted hazardous components such as pathogenic bacteria viruses fungi and their metabolic products lehtinen et al 2013 park et al 2011 bioaerosols can be produced in the process of bubble aeration mechanical agitation and sludge dewatering which are from the grit chamber the biological treatment unit sludge dewatering room and other facilities of wwtps apart from their atmospheric and ecological impacts bioaerosols can become a serious risk to health of the population in recent decades increasing research interests have been placed in bioaerosol field thus triggering many outstanding research opportunities yao 2018 bioaerosol is a subject involving multidisciplinary research fields such as microbiology air pollution medical science biochemistry and etc gaseous odors and bioaerosols are both undesirable atmospheric contaminants in wwtps and may be emitted from similar facilities although a few studies involved the simultaneous removal of odors and bioaerosols in various systems lehtinen et al 2013 park et al 2011 their synergistic treatment evaluation and assessment in as processes currently remain a research gap 6 conclusions recently there has been a growing interest regarding the as based deodorization technologies in wwtps due to their great economic and technological potentials in this paper recent advances on three as technologies of odor treatment i e as recycling microaeration in digesters and as diffusion were reviewed they are all environmentally friendly economic precautionary or end of the pipe odor treatment strategies with appreciable odor removal efficiency which can be integrated with wastewater treatment facilities the utilization of electron acceptors dissolved oxygen do and nitrate by as microorganisms in deodorization were the main treatment principles polysulfide was of vital importance in h2s production by sulfate reducing microorganisms the underlying deodorization mechanisms involved multi element conversions and metabolic activities of diverse sob species of which poly s were key intermediates as technologies have the potential to simultaneously remove carbon nitrogen sulfur and phosphate in integrated systems thus simultaneous odor and wastewater treatment by as technology is one valuable topic in future deodorization studies other future trends of as processes for odor control such as in depth deodorization mechanism investigations and synergistic treatment with other air emissions were proposed as well declaration of competing interest the

17843,in this study a coupled system of algal sludge and membrane bioreactor as mbr was established for fouling control and meanwhile the performance of wastewater treatment was enhanced results indicated that the as mbr increased the cod nh4 n tn and po4 3 p removal efficiencies from 91 7 to 95 9 90 8 96 9 22 0 to 34 3 and 18 4 32 6 respectively further analysis suggested that in the as mbr the total specific oxygen utilization rate sour the sour of ammonia oxidizing bacteria and the sour of nitrite oxidizing bacteria were 26 6 58 5 and 52 4 higher than the control respectively indicating the improvement of microbial activities in as mbr additionally the membrane fouling rates in the as mbr were 52 6 and 32 2 lower than the control in the slow and rapid fouling processes respectively a further mechanism investigation demonstrated that the concentrations of extracellular polymeric substance eps were decreased by 19 8 and 22 1 in the mixed liquid and the fouling layer respectively after the inoculation of algae which was expected to have a positive effect on the higher permeability and longer operation cycle of the membrane in the as mbr more regular floc morphology was observed for the fouling layer on the membrane of as mbr with the polysaccharides and proteins forming large clusters and channels in the fouling layer that likely decreased the filtration resistance consequently high throughput sequencing analysis revealed that the microbial community in the as mbr had higher abundances of bacteria and algae related to nutrients and organic matters degradation which was beneficial for the improvement of wastewater treatment and alleviation of membrane fouling graphical abstract image 1 keywords algal sludge membrane bioreactor extracellular polymeric substances fouling microbial community 1 introduction membrane bioreactors mbrs have been globally developed as a state of the art technology for wastewater treatment and reuse judd 2008 hai et al 2014 the attraction of the mbr lies in its effective solid rejection small footprint and high sludge concentration however in order to provide air scour of membranes high aeration intensity is always applied to conquer the high non newtonian viscosity and to satisfy the microbial oxygen demand rosenberger et al 2002 unfortunately the high aeration intensity would inhibit the activity of denitrifying bacteria and phosphorus accumulating bacteria pao and increase energy consumption leading to the reduction of n and p removal and increase in operation costs in addition membrane fouling and accompanying frequent membrane cleaning or replacement are deemed as inevitable and are still receiving great attention in spite of many research and engineering efforts conducted meng et al 2009 kumar et al 2012 therefore developing an efficient strategy to conquer the drawbacks as mentioned above is in great need of in the mbr field to date while there has been some progress in solving individual problems through for example the construction of multiunit systems the use of intermittent aeration and or back washing and optimization of the operation conditions li et al 2019a b lyko et al 2008 nywening and zhou 2009 a gap in addressing all drawbacks in a facile manner still remains more recently algae bacteria photobioreactor techniques have gained popularity because of their excellent n and p removal performance and low need for aeration park et al 2013 su et al 2012 furthermore it has been reported that sludge containing algae may improve the membrane filtration performance due to the reduced concentration of extracellular polymeric substance eps that is regarded as a critical membrane fouling factor huang et al 2015 hwang et al 2010 xu et al 2014 thus the inoculation of algae in an mbr is expected to have the merits of improved nutrient removal rates a decrease in the aeration intensity and mitigated membrane fouling which would largely solve the aforementioned problems in a single system our recent study shows that an innovative system that integrates the algal and bacterial processes in an mbr displays good performance in pollutant removal and membrane fouling control even at a low aeration intensity of 0 11 m3 h sun et al 2018 the algal bacterial consortia formed in the reactor can induce positive effects on the floc properties and the growth environment which contributes to the improvement of the mbr performance in contrast to the achievement in understanding of how best pollutants can be removed in an algae bacteria system the number of investigations on the underlying mechanism related to the alleviation of membrane fouling is limited in general the flocs from the bulk solution deposit on the membrane surface during operation and consequently form a fouling layer that plays an important role in changing the membrane permeability khan et al 2009 lin et al 2011 wang et al 2007 in this type of algae bacteria mbr due to the modification of the floc properties and the growth environment in the presence of algae the fouling layer may significantly vary in response leading to a slower flux decline generally membrane fouling occurs in the primary fouling pathways including foulant adhesion deposition teng et al 2019 li et al 2019a b chen et al 2019 and fouling layer filtration process chen et al 2020 long et al 2020 teng et al 2020 therefore a comprehensive investigation of the structure and composition of the fouling layer formed during filtration is essential essentially when linking algae with a wastewater sludge system microbial community variation may play a critical role because the process is closely associated with the ecological interactions in response to the performance of the coupled mbr in an as mbr system bacteria and algae are expected to have a mutualistic relationship by supplying co2 vitamins and auxins produced from bacteria for algal growth ramanan et al 2016 and or providing o2 and organic matters generated by algae for bacterial growth gonçalves et al 2017 thus algae could stimulate a specific gouro of bacteria to form their cooperative interactions and regulate their survival environment which further influences the biosynthesis and biological metabolic processes and then the system performance moreover although higher n and p removal efficiencies were observed under algal inoculation no reports have shown the characteristics of functionally active n and p bacteria aob nob and pao following the inoculation of algae and the mechanism through which these microbial communities contribute to n and p removal therefore it is necessary to ascertain the variation of functional microbial communities and their relationship with nutrient removal and membrane fouling herein the objectives of this study are i to examine nutrient removal and the detailed changes of the transmembrane pressure tmp in the coupled system ii to characterize the fouling layers and understand the effects and mechanisms of membrane fouling and iii to investigate the impact of algae on microbial community structures operational taxonomic unit otu changes and the distribution of special functional bacteria to reveal the relationship with performance 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor configuration and experimental procedures two reactors were set up in this study one was inoculated with algae and named the algae sludge mbr as mbr and the other conventional mbr served as the control system without the addition of algae and was referred to as the c mbr a detailed schematic representation of the asb mbr and the c mbr is shown in fig 1 in the as mbr the inoculation ratio of algae and sludge was 1 5 the experiments were conducted in columnar pvc bioreactors with a working volume of 6 5 l a membrane module polyvinylidene fluoride hollow fiber membrane module with a surface area of 0 1 m2 and a mean pore size of 0 2 μm was installed vertically in the center of the bioreactor under a constant membrane flux of 6 8 l m2 h air was provided via a coarse bubble diffuser mounted at the bottom of the reactor the aeration rate was 0 11 m3 h synthetic wastewater the composition was as follows starch 200 16 2 mg l glucose 200 14 6 mg l nh4cl 151 9 5 mg l kh2po4 21 9 4 3 mg l nahco3 200 400 mg l mgso4 40 5 1 mg l cacl2 5 0 8 mg l trace elements was pumped to the reactor using a peristaltic pump the influent was continuously fed into each mbr at a flow rate of 540 ml h and the effluent was operated at 675 ml h with a filtration to idle ratio of 8 min 2 min the hydraulic retention time hrt was 12 h in each mbr the mixed liquor suspended solid mlss of each mbr was maintained at 3300 150 mg l by sludge discharge in order to keep the sludge loading rate consistent for the comparison the sludge retention times srts of as mbr and c mbr were slightly different 17 and 22 days respectively due to the higher biomass yield rate in as mbr resulting from the beneficial relationship between algae and sludge bacteria notably the as mbr was operated with lights surrounding the reactor and the incoming light intensity was 3000 lx under a 12 h 12 h cycle of light and dark the two mbrs were operated for more than 140 days including 30 days of prior stable state and more than 110 days stable operation the inoculated activated sludge was collected from the secondary sedimentation tank of the wenchang municipal wastewater treatment plant located at harbin heilongjiang china before the experiment the sludge bacteria were fed twice every day with the synthetic wastewater for 10 days after adaptation the mlss of the activated sludge was 5000 mg l and the sludge was used as the inoculum for bacteria the algae were derived from the secondary clarifier supernatant from the same wastewater plant as the sludge inoculum before tests the algae were cultured for enriching in the nutrient solution the composition of which was the same as the artificial wastewater used in the experiment the nutrient solution was replaced every two days with the algal cells harvested by centrifugation followed by re suspension co2 sparging was provided by a diffuser installed vertically in the center of the incubator the incoming light intensity for the algae was 4000 lx with 18 h light 6 h dark cycle at 22 3 c after 15 days enrichment the mlss concentration of algae was 500 700 mg l and then used as the inoculum 2 2 performance evaluation the performance evaluations of the two mbrs were carried out by comparing the water quality indexes between the influent and effluent and the characteristics of membrane fouling the water quality indexes which included the chemical oxygen demand cod nh4 n total nitrogen tn and po4 3 p were measured according to the standard methods apha and wef 2005 the biomass uptake of nitrogen was calculated by the study of barros et al 2017 the samples of wastewater treatment were extracted every three days and each index was measured in triplicate the membrane fouling was investigated by the tmp which is directly related to membrane permeability and is closely associated with the process of membrane fouling the membrane module was physically cleaned when the tmp of each mbr reached 30 kpa once both mbrs reached 30 kpa the fouling membrane module was submerged in 0 5 v w naclo solution for 2 h to recover the membrane permeability wang et al 2008 the dissolved oxygen do and ph were measured by a do meter oxi3210 wtw germany and a ph meter fe20k mettler toledo switzerland respectively the total specific oxygen utilization rate sour the sour of ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and the sour of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob were measured according to the method of tang et al 2016 the above analyses were conducted in triplicate and their average values were reported 2 3 eps extraction and analysis the eps were extracted from the mixed liquid in the reactor every three days the same extraction method was used for both the loosely bound extracellular polymeric substance lb eps and the tightly bound extracellular polymeric substance tb eps as documented in hwang et al 2010 the lb eps and tb eps were analyzed for their protein pr and polysaccharide ps concentrations using the lowry method lowry et al 1951 and the phenol sulfuric method dubois et al 1956 respectively 2 4 morphology observation the sample was extracted from the fouling layer in the mbr when its tmp reached 30 kpa without chemical cleaning the above analyses were conducted in duplicate at different location of membrane surface scanning electron microscopy sem s 3000n hitachi japan was used to observe the morphology of the fouling layer the membrane surface topography was observed by using an atomic force microscope afm veeco santa barbara ca images were acquired using the nanoscope control software version 5 30r3sr3 the arithmetic average roughness ra and the root mean square average roughness rq were used to evaluate the surface roughness values quantitatively analyzing the afm height images of 10 10 μm areas the shape of the flocs including the roundness ro form factor ff and aspect ratio ar were calculated according to the study of meng et al 2006 images of the flocs were dyed and the area length perimeter and width of the sludge flocs were analyzed with the image pro plus 6 0 software media cybernetics inc the distribution characteristics of pr protein and ps polysaccharide in the fouling layer were observed using confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm leica sp2 aobs leica germany the pr and ps were stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate fitc and calcofluor white respectively chen et al 2006 image pro plus was used to calculate the structure including the biovolume and the thickness based on the image information acquired by the clsm beyenal et al 2004 2 5 microbial community generally a bioreactor is considered to be an artificial microecosystem consisting of abundant or several functional microorganism communities which are closely associated with the bioreactor performance to elucidate the mechanisms of wastewater treatment and membrane fouling the samples collected on day 100 from each mbr and the inoculum were analyzed and the changes in the microbial community structures were compared moreover the high throughput sequencing procedure was applied to investigate the composition of the bacterial and algal communities first the bacterial dna extraction were conducted in triplicate and the method was according to the study of ding et al 2016 the cell walls of the algae were destroyed with liquid nitrogen before the algae dna was extracted second 16s rrna gene and 18s rrna gene polymerase chain reaction pcr amplification and pcr product were conducted in triplicate for each sample and then they were combined and purified using axyprep dna gel extraction kit and tris hcl 341f primer and 805r primer were used to amplify and sequence the v3 v4 region of the 16s rrna gene and 18s rrna primers of 528 f and 706 r amplicons from all samples were mixed at equal concentrations finally following tests were carried out based on the combination of the three replicates for each sample the library was sequenced on an illumina hiseq 2500 platform novogene china the image pro plus 6 0 software was used to evaluate the integrated optical density iod values of the fish images 2 6 statistical analysis the shapiro wilk and levene s test were used to compute the normality in frequentist statistics and the equality of the data variances respectively the student t test was used to examine the statistically significant difference p 0 05 between groups all values which were conducted with t test were the averages of results from triplicate tests 3 results and discussion 3 1 wastewater treatment improvement the wastewater treatment performance of the as mbr and the c mbr are shown in fig 2 it can be seen that the cod nh4 n tn and po4 3 p removal efficiencies in the as mbr were increased from 91 7 to 95 9 90 8 96 9 22 0 34 3 and 18 4 32 6 respectively which indicated an improvement in the wastewater treatment performance after inoculating the algae to gain insight into the relationship between biological activity and nutrient removal in the presence of algae the sour was measured the results showed that the total sour the detailed data are shown in fig s1 in the as mbr was 26 6 higher than that in the c mbr suggesting the enhancement of microbial biological activity in the as mbr which is expected to contribute to the improvement of nutrient removal in the as mbr notably higher n and p removal efficiencies were observed in the as mbr compared to the c mbr implying that algae have a significant contribution to the removal of n and p according to the souraob and sournob results the ammoxidation and nitrification increased from 4 1 mg o2 g vss h to 6 5 mg o2 g vss h and from 6 3 mg o2 g vss h to 9 6 mg o2 g vss h following the inoculation of algae respectively suggesting the enhancement of aob and nob activities in the presence of algae while the removal efficiencies of nh4 n and the biological activities of aob and nob in the as mbr were higher than those of the c mbr the concentrations of no2 n and no3 n were not significantly increased it should be noted that the increase in tn removal was higher than that of nh4 n in the as mbr implying that the nitrate nitrite and simple organic nitrogen such as amino acids might be assimilated into the algal biomass which was in accordance with the observations in the study of barsanti and gualtieri 2006 furthermore it was found that showed that microbial biomass uptake were 112 86 2 2 mg day and 69 3 2 1 mg day in as mbr and c mbr respectively that phenomenon indicated that the biomass uptake of microorganism in the as mbr was much higher than that of the c mbr which may be due to the amelioration of microbial activity in as mbr as mentioned above hence both of the enhancement of microbial activity and the assimilation of nitrate nitrite and simple organic nitrogen by algae contributed to the improvement of tn removal efficiency in the as mbr regarding the removal of phosphorus the assimilation of biomass by microbial cells was the major pathway in this study under a neutral ph environment because abiotic precipitation most likely occurred in the alkaline solution the investigation of biomass production showed that biomass in the as mbr was 26 7 higher than that of the c mbr per day which indicated the faster growth of microorganism in the as mbr additionally the ratio of phosphorus to biomass content in the as mbr 3 3 was higher than that in the c mbr 2 1 further suggesting the improvement of biomass assimilation activity for phosphorus in the as mbr hence the enhancement of the biomass growth rate and the biomass assimilation activity in the as mbr contributed to a higher po4 3 p removal based on the above analysis introducing the algae into the mbr ameliorated d the biological activity of bacteria and algae which would contribute to the higher nutrient removal efficiency compared with c mbr during wastewater treatment notably the do concentrations in the as mbr and c mbr were 4 3 0 3 mg l and 3 3 0 1 mg l respectively in other words the do concentration in as mbr was increased by 30 1 even at the same aeration rate for the two mbrs due to the extra o2 generated by algal photosynthesis it is known that do concentration is one of key factors for microbial respiration contributing to organic matter degradation and nitrification hence the increase of do concentration could be another reason for better nutrient removal after algal inoculation even though the activities of denitrifying bacteria and phosphorus accumulating bacteria were expected to be inhibited under the fully aeration characteristic of the one stage mbr georg et al 1993 jeoll and joann 1999 in summary compared with c mbr the higher microbial activity biomass assimilation and do concentration achieved in as mbr system dominated the improvement of nutrient removal during wastewater treatment 3 2 fouling behavior mitigation 3 2 1 tmp development in this study a two stage process with an initial slow tmp rise followed by a rapid increase occurred in the tmp profiles which was in accordance with the study of zhang et al 2006 the result in table 1 showed that the slow fouling rate dtmp dt in the as mbr was 52 6 lower than that of the c mbr in terms of the rapid fouling process the average increase rate was 32 2 lower in the as mbr than in the c mbr fig s2 cho and fane 2002 demonstrated that the two stage fouling processes were attributed to the blockage of membrane pores in the slow fouling stage and the attachment of the dominant foulant biomass on the membrane surface in the rapid fouling stage thus lower fouling rates for the two stage processes in the as mbr suggested that the reduction of membrane pore blocking and or the decrease of floc accumulation on the membrane surface may occur contributing to the alleviation of membrane fouling after inoculating the algae during the filtration process the eps and other organic substances existing in the mixed liquor could be adsorbed into membrane pores and deposit on the membrane surface to form a fouling layer which would result in a hydraulic resistance to the permeate flow additionally the formation of fouling layer on the membrane surface was mainly responsible for the loss of membrane filterability meng et al 2009 while the fouling layer was analyzed at the end of the experimentation comprehensive investigation into the properties of the fouling layer is expected to understand how the development of the fouling layer influenced the membrane filterability which in turn is directly linked to the pattern of tmp increase 3 2 2 the characterization of the eps the data of the eps concentrations in the two mbrs are shown in fig 3 the average eps concentrations the sum of the lb eps and the tb eps in the as mbr were 19 8 and 22 1 lower than those of the c mbr in the mixed liquor and the fouling layer respectively as is well known eps are composed of microbial activity metabolites intracellular materials and organic matter adsorbed from influent media and can be used by bacteria as sources of carbon and energy for metabolic activity yu et al 2009 as mentioned above the sludge in the as mbr had a higher activity than that in the c mbr suggesting that the eps can be more easily degraded by algal microbes resulting in the reduction of eps in the as mbr because excessive eps would deteriorate the structure of flocs enhance the adhesion of flocs and accelerate the accumulation of flocs on the membrane surface the decrease of eps concentration in the as mbr is expected to play a positive role in membrane fouling mitigation after algal inoculation generally eps is comprised of lb eps and tb eps lb eps with dynamic double layered structure diffuses from the tb eps that surrounds the cell accordingly the concentrations of lb eps and tb eps were measured to further investigate the specific correlations of lb eps and tb eps with membrane fouling we found that as for the mixed liquor fig 3a the concentrations of lb eps and tb eps decreased by 37 1 and 10 9 respectively in the as mbr suggesting that the lb eps in the mixed liquor were more sensitive than the tb eps with the inoculation of algae meanwhile the concentrations of lb eps and tb eps in the fouling layer fig 3b of the as mbr were both lower than those of the c mbr with the reduction of the tb eps 18 7 being more significant than that of the lb eps 12 1 this result indicated that the tb eps showed more significant correlations with the presence of algae in the fouling layer in general the sludge cells in the outer region of flocs are entangled by weak interactions through lb eps the tb eps are responsible for cell adhesion and attachment in the inner floc structure through strong interactions hence on one hand excessive lb eps and tb eps might weaken the microbial floc structure and increase cell attachment which would enhance the adhesion on the membrane surface and aggravate membrane fouling hwang et al 2010 on the other hand according to the different contributions of the lb eps and tb eps to the sludge aggregation we conclude that the significant reduction of lb eps in the mixed liquor would probably lead to a more stable sludge suspension the significant decrease of tb eps in the fouling layer indicated less adhesion and attachment of flocs on the membrane surface in the as mbr contributed to the alleviation of membrane fouling 3 3 characteristics of the fouling layers in mbrs the fouling layer generally includes two layers namely the deposited layer and the developed layer which are classified in the term of the predominant fouling components on the membrane surface chen et al 2006 the former is the initial fouling layer and is much closer to the membrane surface than the latter the microscale level semi quantitative analysis of the morphological characteristics was provided by sem as shown in fig 4 a the sem results showed that the thickness of the deposited layer in the c mbr was larger than that of the as mbr moreover the deposited layer of the c mbr was seriously compressed with less porosity whereas the deposited layer of the as mbr was fluffy with many more pores the larger thickness and lower number of pores may contribute to the reduction of membrane permeability and meanwhile cause membrane fouling aggravation hence those results implied that the change in the deposited layer characteristics after introducing algae into an mbr may be one of the reasons for the membrane fouling mitigation in the as mbr in addition to the morphological characteristics the surface topography of a sample can be characterized by afm to some extent for afm images the brown color and the yellow color indicate a valley and a peak on the surface respectively as show in fig 4b the peaks and valleys in the as mbr were relatively smoother than those in the c mbr additionally the ra and rq which represent the roughness of the membrane surface quantitatively were 28 1 and 24 2 lower in the as mbr than those of the c mbr respectively further confirming that the membrane surface roughness decreased with the inoculation of algae some studies have reported that a membrane with a rough surface may offer valleys for flocs particles to stack up on leading to pore blockage and subsequent increases in the intensity of membrane fouling iorhemen et al 2016 accordingly the deposited layer with a rougher surface could contribute to further membrane fouling in the c mbr further investigations were conducted to explore the reasons for the different deposited layer characteristics between the as mbr and the c mbr and the floc size and shapes were measured the average floc size of as mbr was 22 9 lower than that of c mbr fig s3 which might contribute to the formation of smoother foulant layer of as mbr additionally compared with the c mbr the parameters of floc morphology in the as mbr including ro ff and ar were much closer to 1 than those in the c mbr the detailed data are shown in table s2 indicating that the flocs in the as mbr were more spherical inerratic and smooth than those in the c mbr fig s4 provides visual evidence of how flocs adhere to the membrane surface it was supposed that when particles were more regularly shaped there was a smaller probability for the particles to deposit in the valley of the rough membranes additionally meng et al 2006 reported that the foulant layer which was composed of the more regularly shaped sludge flocs did not easily accumulate on the surface of the membrane during the filtration process thus the improvement of the floc characteristics from the algal inoculation which resulted in the formation of a thinner deposited layer with a lower roughness on the membrane surface could enhance the membrane permeability in the as mbr in comparison with the deposited layer the developed layer is believed to be caused by increases in the local flux in some regions of the membrane to maintain the fixed average flux and exceeding the critical flux of the dominant foulant biomass hence an insight into the visual and quantified analysis of the developed layer would be helpful for better understanding the influence of algae on the membrane fouling process clsm can provide a visual analysis of the floc matrix with the nondestructive in situ examination of flocs and quantitative information on the inner structure of the foulant layer by digital image analysis to investigate the developed layer of the membrane surface clsm was scanned at 10 μm above the membrane surface chen et al 2006 the images of the perpendicular planes of clsm fig 5 showed that the ensembles including polysaccharides and proteins aggregated into clusters and formed channels in the developed layer in the as mbr fig 5a while a continuous layer was observed in the c mbr fig 5b these large clusters and channels in the developed layer of the as mbr may benefit the flow of water through the membrane with a higher membrane permeability in the as mbr which was in accordance with the observations in the study of chen et al 2006 in which a continuous and compact layer had a negative influence on membrane filtration as shown in the 3d clsm images fig s5 more porous structures were observed in the developed layer of as mbr which is consistent with the observation of large clusters and channels formed in the as mbr additionally it can be seen from fig s5 that the green color representing proteins was dominant in the developed layer of c mbr compared with coexistence of proteins and polysaccharides in the as mbr tian et al 2012 demonstrated that protein could offer a greater barrier to the permeate flow because of its hydrophobicity property contributing to the higher fouling rate in c mbr a further image analysis i e image pro plus 6 0 revealed that the biovolume of the developed layers were increased by 26 3 in the as mbr compared with that in the c mbr this phenomenon appears to be mainly attributable to the longer operation time to reach tmp of 30 kpa than that of c mbr resulting in the accumulation of more biomass in as mbr taking into account the fact that the higher biovolume of the developed layer but the much lower fouling rate were observed in as mbr than those in the c mbr it is expected that the difference in membrane permeability between the two mbrs could be attributed to some architecture characteristics of the developed layer such as the spatial distribution of biomass the porous structures and the ratio of protein to polysaccharides instead of biomass accumulation in summary it can be concluded that the algal inoculation shows positive effects on the improvement of membrane fouling through the reduction of eps concentrations and the modification of the fouling layer properties with thin porous smooth and disconnected characteristics in the as mbr resulting in an increase in the membrane permeability 3 4 microbial community variation 3 4 1 bacterial community variation to provide insight into the mechanisms of efficient wastewater treatment and membrane fouling mitigation in the as mbr phylogenetic analyses were carried out in the two mbrs and the raw sludge raw based upon otu data the alpha diversity was assessed by calculating the diversity indexes the shannon index and the simpson index show community evenness richness estimators the chao1 and abundance based coverage estimator ace show community richness and coverage which show the sequencing depth the results of the biodiversity parameters in this study are shown in table 2 obviously the coverages in both mbrs and raw were more than 0 95 suggesting the validity of the sequencing compared with the c mbr the microbial community diversity indexes estimated by the shannon index and the simpson index were decreased and increased in the as mbr respectively while the richness as represented by chao 1 and ace was lower in the as mbr in the as mbr the bacteria showed the lowest microbial richness and diversity and the distribution of the remaining community became less even this could be attributed to the presence of algae which may change the microenvironment fulfil the algal bacterial ecological relationship and lead to the extinction of some species and an increase of low abundance bacteria in microbial ecological systems it is generally recognized that fewer species and a lower community evenness suggest a well defined internal structure for the dominant species ma et al 2013 therefore the decrease of microbial richness and diversity indicated that some specific dominant bacteria were formed after inoculating the algae hierarchical cluster analysis was performed at the phyla and class levels fig 6 for the phyla level fig 6a planctomycetes proteobacteria verrucomicrobia firmicutes and bacteroidetes were the dominant groups in the two mbrs while the relative abundance of these microorganisms changed during operation the relative abundances of planctomycetes and proteobacteria in the as mbr increased by 8 4 and 5 5 respectively compared with those in c mbr the enrichment of these bacteria could contribute to the higher cod and tn removal in the as mbr additionally another dominant group of phylum the bacteroidetes increased from 3 0 to 4 6 in the presence of algae the bacteroidetes family includes a large number of genes that are related to the degradation of complex macromolecules such as eps abed et al 2007 which could be one of the reasons for the lower eps concentrations in the as mbr interestingly compared with the c mbr the relative abundances of verrucomicrobia and firmicutes showed an opposite situation with the abovementioned bacteria for which the relative abundance decreased after inoculating the algae verrucomicrobia are often found in phosphorus enriched environments lindström et al 2004 which was in accordance with the lower p removal in the c mbr firmicutes have been commonly reported to accelerate the formation of biofilms on membrane surfaces during mbr operation gao et al 2014 hence the more abundant firmicutes could contribute to the easier attachment of sludge onto the membrane in the c mbr further analysis on the class level fig 6b showed that the dominant groups changed due to the change of the microenvironment by algae which varied from planctomycetia alphaproteobacteria and verrucomicrobiae to only planctomycetia and alphaproteobacteria this might be attributed to the presence of algae have a distaste or their activity changing the microenvironment which resulted in the inhibition of the verrucomicrobiae family it is noted that the relative abundances of bacilli decreased after the inoculation of algae which acted as the framework with filamentious as the matrix in the fouling layer that could promote flocs adhering onto the membrane and thereby increase membrane fouling meng et al 2007 yu et al 2014 cytophagia which can enhance the degradation of the high molecular mass fraction of dissolved organic matter such as eps cottrell and kirchman 2000 kirchman 2002 increased by 2 0 in the as mbr compared to that in the c mbr an otu network analysis was employed to evaluate the variation and linkage of species between the microbial communities in the as mbr and the c mbr fig 6c it is obvious that there are four distinctive regions including i ii iii and iv which accounted for 5 2 16 0 17 9 and 60 9 of the total observed otus respectively regions i and iii represented the unique communities of the as mbr and the c mbr respectively regions ii and iv are shared regions between the as mbr and the c mbr and between the two mbrs and the raw respectively the otus in the shared regions were three times higher than those in the unique regions suggesting that the shared otus covered the majority of the samples notably the functional bacteria in the shared otus were higher than those in the unique otus at the class level the functional communities of the as mbr in the shared otus were 34 7 higher than those of the c mbr in view of the above it could be concluded that with the inoculation of algae the variation of the microbial communities mainly occurred in the shared otus rather than in the unique otus to further understand the effect of algae on nutrient removal additional research has been focused on monitoring the amount of pao aob and nob after algal inoculums the iod was measured to quantify the number of active bacteria in the fluorescence image the iod of the pao in the as mbr was quantified to be approximately 543192 which increased by 30 3 compared with the c mbr 417032 the detailed data are shown in table s3 moreover the iod of the aob and nob active bacteria in the sludge of the as mbr were 33 1 and 13 0 higher than those in the c mbr respectively these findings suggested that the functionally active bacteria were enriched after inoculating the algae this phenomenon was in accordance with the finding mentioned above that is algae have a positive effect on the growth of pao aob and nob active bacteria thus improving n c and p removal in the as mbr 3 4 2 algal community variation as mentioned above the algal growth reduced the bacterial diversity and affected the bacterial community structure meanwhile the stimulated bacteria would have a beneficial effect on the growth of the algal community to facilitate the formation of an algal bacterial symbiotic system as shown in table 3 the coverage of each sample was beyond 1 indicating an adequate sequencing depth for the illumina miseq given that the shannon index ace and chao 1 of the as mbr were much higher than those of the raw inoculum raw it could be inferred that the algae community in the as mbr was more even and had a greater richness after living with the bacteria interestingly the bacterial biodiversity in the symbiotic system decreased with the class of algae while the diversity of algae increased on the bacteria stimulate the increase of algal diversity may lead to an improved ability to adapt to the environmental selection pressure of bacterial stimulation resulting from the much larger bacterial community population which would be helpful to construct a symbiotic system of bacteria and algae to further explore the effect of the bacterial population on algal communities the algal phylogenetic classification was identified at class level and genus level the primary algal classes were not shifted significantly in the as mbr compared with raw which were chlorophyceae trebouxiophyceae ulvophyceae dinophyceae and mediophyceae as for the genus level fig 7 the primary genus included acutodesmus sp unidentified chlorophyceae sp ankistrodesmus sp jbna46 sp ochromonas sp unidentified ochromonadales sp paraphysomonas sp auxenochlorella sp chlorella sp unidentified ulvophyceae sp spiniferodinium sp and thalassiosira sp while the primary genus species of algae were not shifted significantly in the as mbr variation in the relative abundance after consorting with the bacteria was observed for example the relative abundance of unidentified chlorophyceae significantly increased from 2 1 to 43 3 which was a stable algal species that volunteered with bacterial interactions auxenochlorella sp which are facultative heterotrophic and prefer an organic carbon substrate over co2 fixation when possible mahapatra et al 2014 wang et al 2014 increased from 1 1 to 2 0 compared with the inoculum it is expected that they can simultaneously drive phototrophy and heterotrophy to utilize both inorganic co2 and organic carbon substrates thus leading to an additive or synergistic effect of the two processes that enhance productivity and the capability of microalgae to assimilate in wastewaters cao et al 2014 moreover chlorella sp was enriched after consorting with the bacteria in the as mbr the family of chlorella sp could assimilate excess phosphorus to promote algal cell growth which plays an important role in the enhancement of phosphorus removal in the as mbr eixler et al 2006 it is easy to note that the relative abundance of acutodesmus sp remarkably decreased from 95 3 to 50 1 which may be attributed to the negative interaction with bacterial growth and thus the inhibition of acutodesmus sp growth occurred in summary the variation of the algal community structure contributed to the cooperative interactions with the bacterial population and further improved the performance of the as mbr through the construction of a symbiotic system of bacteria and algae 4 conclusions the combined as mbr was operated for 100 days in the present investigation the results confirmed the benefits of the as mbr over the c mbr in the aspects of wastewater treatment and membrane fouling alleviation the microbial activity fouling layer morphology and microbial communities were comprehensively illuminated to yield insight into their relationship with the mbr performance the improvement of biological activity contributed to increased nutrient removal efficiencies the reduction in the eps concentration and the lower thickness and roughness of the deposited layer with the higher porosity and larger channels of the polysaccharides and proteins in the developed layers significantly contributed to the membrane fouling mitigation in as mbr the changes of microbial diversity and the enrichment of functional microbes after inoculating the algae were ultimately responsible for the enhanced performance declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

17843,in this study a coupled system of algal sludge and membrane bioreactor as mbr was established for fouling control and meanwhile the performance of wastewater treatment was enhanced results indicated that the as mbr increased the cod nh4 n tn and po4 3 p removal efficiencies from 91 7 to 95 9 90 8 96 9 22 0 to 34 3 and 18 4 32 6 respectively further analysis suggested that in the as mbr the total specific oxygen utilization rate sour the sour of ammonia oxidizing bacteria and the sour of nitrite oxidizing bacteria were 26 6 58 5 and 52 4 higher than the control respectively indicating the improvement of microbial activities in as mbr additionally the membrane fouling rates in the as mbr were 52 6 and 32 2 lower than the control in the slow and rapid fouling processes respectively a further mechanism investigation demonstrated that the concentrations of extracellular polymeric substance eps were decreased by 19 8 and 22 1 in the mixed liquid and the fouling layer respectively after the inoculation of algae which was expected to have a positive effect on the higher permeability and longer operation cycle of the membrane in the as mbr more regular floc morphology was observed for the fouling layer on the membrane of as mbr with the polysaccharides and proteins forming large clusters and channels in the fouling layer that likely decreased the filtration resistance consequently high throughput sequencing analysis revealed that the microbial community in the as mbr had higher abundances of bacteria and algae related to nutrients and organic matters degradation which was beneficial for the improvement of wastewater treatment and alleviation of membrane fouling graphical abstract image 1 keywords algal sludge membrane bioreactor extracellular polymeric substances fouling microbial community 1 introduction membrane bioreactors mbrs have been globally developed as a state of the art technology for wastewater treatment and reuse judd 2008 hai et al 2014 the attraction of the mbr lies in its effective solid rejection small footprint and high sludge concentration however in order to provide air scour of membranes high aeration intensity is always applied to conquer the high non newtonian viscosity and to satisfy the microbial oxygen demand rosenberger et al 2002 unfortunately the high aeration intensity would inhibit the activity of denitrifying bacteria and phosphorus accumulating bacteria pao and increase energy consumption leading to the reduction of n and p removal and increase in operation costs in addition membrane fouling and accompanying frequent membrane cleaning or replacement are deemed as inevitable and are still receiving great attention in spite of many research and engineering efforts conducted meng et al 2009 kumar et al 2012 therefore developing an efficient strategy to conquer the drawbacks as mentioned above is in great need of in the mbr field to date while there has been some progress in solving individual problems through for example the construction of multiunit systems the use of intermittent aeration and or back washing and optimization of the operation conditions li et al 2019a b lyko et al 2008 nywening and zhou 2009 a gap in addressing all drawbacks in a facile manner still remains more recently algae bacteria photobioreactor techniques have gained popularity because of their excellent n and p removal performance and low need for aeration park et al 2013 su et al 2012 furthermore it has been reported that sludge containing algae may improve the membrane filtration performance due to the reduced concentration of extracellular polymeric substance eps that is regarded as a critical membrane fouling factor huang et al 2015 hwang et al 2010 xu et al 2014 thus the inoculation of algae in an mbr is expected to have the merits of improved nutrient removal rates a decrease in the aeration intensity and mitigated membrane fouling which would largely solve the aforementioned problems in a single system our recent study shows that an innovative system that integrates the algal and bacterial processes in an mbr displays good performance in pollutant removal and membrane fouling control even at a low aeration intensity of 0 11 m3 h sun et al 2018 the algal bacterial consortia formed in the reactor can induce positive effects on the floc properties and the growth environment which contributes to the improvement of the mbr performance in contrast to the achievement in understanding of how best pollutants can be removed in an algae bacteria system the number of investigations on the underlying mechanism related to the alleviation of membrane fouling is limited in general the flocs from the bulk solution deposit on the membrane surface during operation and consequently form a fouling layer that plays an important role in changing the membrane permeability khan et al 2009 lin et al 2011 wang et al 2007 in this type of algae bacteria mbr due to the modification of the floc properties and the growth environment in the presence of algae the fouling layer may significantly vary in response leading to a slower flux decline generally membrane fouling occurs in the primary fouling pathways including foulant adhesion deposition teng et al 2019 li et al 2019a b chen et al 2019 and fouling layer filtration process chen et al 2020 long et al 2020 teng et al 2020 therefore a comprehensive investigation of the structure and composition of the fouling layer formed during filtration is essential essentially when linking algae with a wastewater sludge system microbial community variation may play a critical role because the process is closely associated with the ecological interactions in response to the performance of the coupled mbr in an as mbr system bacteria and algae are expected to have a mutualistic relationship by supplying co2 vitamins and auxins produced from bacteria for algal growth ramanan et al 2016 and or providing o2 and organic matters generated by algae for bacterial growth gonçalves et al 2017 thus algae could stimulate a specific gouro of bacteria to form their cooperative interactions and regulate their survival environment which further influences the biosynthesis and biological metabolic processes and then the system performance moreover although higher n and p removal efficiencies were observed under algal inoculation no reports have shown the characteristics of functionally active n and p bacteria aob nob and pao following the inoculation of algae and the mechanism through which these microbial communities contribute to n and p removal therefore it is necessary to ascertain the variation of functional microbial communities and their relationship with nutrient removal and membrane fouling herein the objectives of this study are i to examine nutrient removal and the detailed changes of the transmembrane pressure tmp in the coupled system ii to characterize the fouling layers and understand the effects and mechanisms of membrane fouling and iii to investigate the impact of algae on microbial community structures operational taxonomic unit otu changes and the distribution of special functional bacteria to reveal the relationship with performance 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor configuration and experimental procedures two reactors were set up in this study one was inoculated with algae and named the algae sludge mbr as mbr and the other conventional mbr served as the control system without the addition of algae and was referred to as the c mbr a detailed schematic representation of the asb mbr and the c mbr is shown in fig 1 in the as mbr the inoculation ratio of algae and sludge was 1 5 the experiments were conducted in columnar pvc bioreactors with a working volume of 6 5 l a membrane module polyvinylidene fluoride hollow fiber membrane module with a surface area of 0 1 m2 and a mean pore size of 0 2 μm was installed vertically in the center of the bioreactor under a constant membrane flux of 6 8 l m2 h air was provided via a coarse bubble diffuser mounted at the bottom of the reactor the aeration rate was 0 11 m3 h synthetic wastewater the composition was as follows starch 200 16 2 mg l glucose 200 14 6 mg l nh4cl 151 9 5 mg l kh2po4 21 9 4 3 mg l nahco3 200 400 mg l mgso4 40 5 1 mg l cacl2 5 0 8 mg l trace elements was pumped to the reactor using a peristaltic pump the influent was continuously fed into each mbr at a flow rate of 540 ml h and the effluent was operated at 675 ml h with a filtration to idle ratio of 8 min 2 min the hydraulic retention time hrt was 12 h in each mbr the mixed liquor suspended solid mlss of each mbr was maintained at 3300 150 mg l by sludge discharge in order to keep the sludge loading rate consistent for the comparison the sludge retention times srts of as mbr and c mbr were slightly different 17 and 22 days respectively due to the higher biomass yield rate in as mbr resulting from the beneficial relationship between algae and sludge bacteria notably the as mbr was operated with lights surrounding the reactor and the incoming light intensity was 3000 lx under a 12 h 12 h cycle of light and dark the two mbrs were operated for more than 140 days including 30 days of prior stable state and more than 110 days stable operation the inoculated activated sludge was collected from the secondary sedimentation tank of the wenchang municipal wastewater treatment plant located at harbin heilongjiang china before the experiment the sludge bacteria were fed twice every day with the synthetic wastewater for 10 days after adaptation the mlss of the activated sludge was 5000 mg l and the sludge was used as the inoculum for bacteria the algae were derived from the secondary clarifier supernatant from the same wastewater plant as the sludge inoculum before tests the algae were cultured for enriching in the nutrient solution the composition of which was the same as the artificial wastewater used in the experiment the nutrient solution was replaced every two days with the algal cells harvested by centrifugation followed by re suspension co2 sparging was provided by a diffuser installed vertically in the center of the incubator the incoming light intensity for the algae was 4000 lx with 18 h light 6 h dark cycle at 22 3 c after 15 days enrichment the mlss concentration of algae was 500 700 mg l and then used as the inoculum 2 2 performance evaluation the performance evaluations of the two mbrs were carried out by comparing the water quality indexes between the influent and effluent and the characteristics of membrane fouling the water quality indexes which included the chemical oxygen demand cod nh4 n total nitrogen tn and po4 3 p were measured according to the standard methods apha and wef 2005 the biomass uptake of nitrogen was calculated by the study of barros et al 2017 the samples of wastewater treatment were extracted every three days and each index was measured in triplicate the membrane fouling was investigated by the tmp which is directly related to membrane permeability and is closely associated with the process of membrane fouling the membrane module was physically cleaned when the tmp of each mbr reached 30 kpa once both mbrs reached 30 kpa the fouling membrane module was submerged in 0 5 v w naclo solution for 2 h to recover the membrane permeability wang et al 2008 the dissolved oxygen do and ph were measured by a do meter oxi3210 wtw germany and a ph meter fe20k mettler toledo switzerland respectively the total specific oxygen utilization rate sour the sour of ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and the sour of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob were measured according to the method of tang et al 2016 the above analyses were conducted in triplicate and their average values were reported 2 3 eps extraction and analysis the eps were extracted from the mixed liquid in the reactor every three days the same extraction method was used for both the loosely bound extracellular polymeric substance lb eps and the tightly bound extracellular polymeric substance tb eps as documented in hwang et al 2010 the lb eps and tb eps were analyzed for their protein pr and polysaccharide ps concentrations using the lowry method lowry et al 1951 and the phenol sulfuric method dubois et al 1956 respectively 2 4 morphology observation the sample was extracted from the fouling layer in the mbr when its tmp reached 30 kpa without chemical cleaning the above analyses were conducted in duplicate at different location of membrane surface scanning electron microscopy sem s 3000n hitachi japan was used to observe the morphology of the fouling layer the membrane surface topography was observed by using an atomic force microscope afm veeco santa barbara ca images were acquired using the nanoscope control software version 5 30r3sr3 the arithmetic average roughness ra and the root mean square average roughness rq were used to evaluate the surface roughness values quantitatively analyzing the afm height images of 10 10 μm areas the shape of the flocs including the roundness ro form factor ff and aspect ratio ar were calculated according to the study of meng et al 2006 images of the flocs were dyed and the area length perimeter and width of the sludge flocs were analyzed with the image pro plus 6 0 software media cybernetics inc the distribution characteristics of pr protein and ps polysaccharide in the fouling layer were observed using confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm leica sp2 aobs leica germany the pr and ps were stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate fitc and calcofluor white respectively chen et al 2006 image pro plus was used to calculate the structure including the biovolume and the thickness based on the image information acquired by the clsm beyenal et al 2004 2 5 microbial community generally a bioreactor is considered to be an artificial microecosystem consisting of abundant or several functional microorganism communities which are closely associated with the bioreactor performance to elucidate the mechanisms of wastewater treatment and membrane fouling the samples collected on day 100 from each mbr and the inoculum were analyzed and the changes in the microbial community structures were compared moreover the high throughput sequencing procedure was applied to investigate the composition of the bacterial and algal communities first the bacterial dna extraction were conducted in triplicate and the method was according to the study of ding et al 2016 the cell walls of the algae were destroyed with liquid nitrogen before the algae dna was extracted second 16s rrna gene and 18s rrna gene polymerase chain reaction pcr amplification and pcr product were conducted in triplicate for each sample and then they were combined and purified using axyprep dna gel extraction kit and tris hcl 341f primer and 805r primer were used to amplify and sequence the v3 v4 region of the 16s rrna gene and 18s rrna primers of 528 f and 706 r amplicons from all samples were mixed at equal concentrations finally following tests were carried out based on the combination of the three replicates for each sample the library was sequenced on an illumina hiseq 2500 platform novogene china the image pro plus 6 0 software was used to evaluate the integrated optical density iod values of the fish images 2 6 statistical analysis the shapiro wilk and levene s test were used to compute the normality in frequentist statistics and the equality of the data variances respectively the student t test was used to examine the statistically significant difference p 0 05 between groups all values which were conducted with t test were the averages of results from triplicate tests 3 results and discussion 3 1 wastewater treatment improvement the wastewater treatment performance of the as mbr and the c mbr are shown in fig 2 it can be seen that the cod nh4 n tn and po4 3 p removal efficiencies in the as mbr were increased from 91 7 to 95 9 90 8 96 9 22 0 34 3 and 18 4 32 6 respectively which indicated an improvement in the wastewater treatment performance after inoculating the algae to gain insight into the relationship between biological activity and nutrient removal in the presence of algae the sour was measured the results showed that the total sour the detailed data are shown in fig s1 in the as mbr was 26 6 higher than that in the c mbr suggesting the enhancement of microbial biological activity in the as mbr which is expected to contribute to the improvement of nutrient removal in the as mbr notably higher n and p removal efficiencies were observed in the as mbr compared to the c mbr implying that algae have a significant contribution to the removal of n and p according to the souraob and sournob results the ammoxidation and nitrification increased from 4 1 mg o2 g vss h to 6 5 mg o2 g vss h and from 6 3 mg o2 g vss h to 9 6 mg o2 g vss h following the inoculation of algae respectively suggesting the enhancement of aob and nob activities in the presence of algae while the removal efficiencies of nh4 n and the biological activities of aob and nob in the as mbr were higher than those of the c mbr the concentrations of no2 n and no3 n were not significantly increased it should be noted that the increase in tn removal was higher than that of nh4 n in the as mbr implying that the nitrate nitrite and simple organic nitrogen such as amino acids might be assimilated into the algal biomass which was in accordance with the observations in the study of barsanti and gualtieri 2006 furthermore it was found that showed that microbial biomass uptake were 112 86 2 2 mg day and 69 3 2 1 mg day in as mbr and c mbr respectively that phenomenon indicated that the biomass uptake of microorganism in the as mbr was much higher than that of the c mbr which may be due to the amelioration of microbial activity in as mbr as mentioned above hence both of the enhancement of microbial activity and the assimilation of nitrate nitrite and simple organic nitrogen by algae contributed to the improvement of tn removal efficiency in the as mbr regarding the removal of phosphorus the assimilation of biomass by microbial cells was the major pathway in this study under a neutral ph environment because abiotic precipitation most likely occurred in the alkaline solution the investigation of biomass production showed that biomass in the as mbr was 26 7 higher than that of the c mbr per day which indicated the faster growth of microorganism in the as mbr additionally the ratio of phosphorus to biomass content in the as mbr 3 3 was higher than that in the c mbr 2 1 further suggesting the improvement of biomass assimilation activity for phosphorus in the as mbr hence the enhancement of the biomass growth rate and the biomass assimilation activity in the as mbr contributed to a higher po4 3 p removal based on the above analysis introducing the algae into the mbr ameliorated d the biological activity of bacteria and algae which would contribute to the higher nutrient removal efficiency compared with c mbr during wastewater treatment notably the do concentrations in the as mbr and c mbr were 4 3 0 3 mg l and 3 3 0 1 mg l respectively in other words the do concentration in as mbr was increased by 30 1 even at the same aeration rate for the two mbrs due to the extra o2 generated by algal photosynthesis it is known that do concentration is one of key factors for microbial respiration contributing to organic matter degradation and nitrification hence the increase of do concentration could be another reason for better nutrient removal after algal inoculation even though the activities of denitrifying bacteria and phosphorus accumulating bacteria were expected to be inhibited under the fully aeration characteristic of the one stage mbr georg et al 1993 jeoll and joann 1999 in summary compared with c mbr the higher microbial activity biomass assimilation and do concentration achieved in as mbr system dominated the improvement of nutrient removal during wastewater treatment 3 2 fouling behavior mitigation 3 2 1 tmp development in this study a two stage process with an initial slow tmp rise followed by a rapid increase occurred in the tmp profiles which was in accordance with the study of zhang et al 2006 the result in table 1 showed that the slow fouling rate dtmp dt in the as mbr was 52 6 lower than that of the c mbr in terms of the rapid fouling process the average increase rate was 32 2 lower in the as mbr than in the c mbr fig s2 cho and fane 2002 demonstrated that the two stage fouling processes were attributed to the blockage of membrane pores in the slow fouling stage and the attachment of the dominant foulant biomass on the membrane surface in the rapid fouling stage thus lower fouling rates for the two stage processes in the as mbr suggested that the reduction of membrane pore blocking and or the decrease of floc accumulation on the membrane surface may occur contributing to the alleviation of membrane fouling after inoculating the algae during the filtration process the eps and other organic substances existing in the mixed liquor could be adsorbed into membrane pores and deposit on the membrane surface to form a fouling layer which would result in a hydraulic resistance to the permeate flow additionally the formation of fouling layer on the membrane surface was mainly responsible for the loss of membrane filterability meng et al 2009 while the fouling layer was analyzed at the end of the experimentation comprehensive investigation into the properties of the fouling layer is expected to understand how the development of the fouling layer influenced the membrane filterability which in turn is directly linked to the pattern of tmp increase 3 2 2 the characterization of the eps the data of the eps concentrations in the two mbrs are shown in fig 3 the average eps concentrations the sum of the lb eps and the tb eps in the as mbr were 19 8 and 22 1 lower than those of the c mbr in the mixed liquor and the fouling layer respectively as is well known eps are composed of microbial activity metabolites intracellular materials and organic matter adsorbed from influent media and can be used by bacteria as sources of carbon and energy for metabolic activity yu et al 2009 as mentioned above the sludge in the as mbr had a higher activity than that in the c mbr suggesting that the eps can be more easily degraded by algal microbes resulting in the reduction of eps in the as mbr because excessive eps would deteriorate the structure of flocs enhance the adhesion of flocs and accelerate the accumulation of flocs on the membrane surface the decrease of eps concentration in the as mbr is expected to play a positive role in membrane fouling mitigation after algal inoculation generally eps is comprised of lb eps and tb eps lb eps with dynamic double layered structure diffuses from the tb eps that surrounds the cell accordingly the concentrations of lb eps and tb eps were measured to further investigate the specific correlations of lb eps and tb eps with membrane fouling we found that as for the mixed liquor fig 3a the concentrations of lb eps and tb eps decreased by 37 1 and 10 9 respectively in the as mbr suggesting that the lb eps in the mixed liquor were more sensitive than the tb eps with the inoculation of algae meanwhile the concentrations of lb eps and tb eps in the fouling layer fig 3b of the as mbr were both lower than those of the c mbr with the reduction of the tb eps 18 7 being more significant than that of the lb eps 12 1 this result indicated that the tb eps showed more significant correlations with the presence of algae in the fouling layer in general the sludge cells in the outer region of flocs are entangled by weak interactions through lb eps the tb eps are responsible for cell adhesion and attachment in the inner floc structure through strong interactions hence on one hand excessive lb eps and tb eps might weaken the microbial floc structure and increase cell attachment which would enhance the adhesion on the membrane surface and aggravate membrane fouling hwang et al 2010 on the other hand according to the different contributions of the lb eps and tb eps to the sludge aggregation we conclude that the significant reduction of lb eps in the mixed liquor would probably lead to a more stable sludge suspension the significant decrease of tb eps in the fouling layer indicated less adhesion and attachment of flocs on the membrane surface in the as mbr contributed to the alleviation of membrane fouling 3 3 characteristics of the fouling layers in mbrs the fouling layer generally includes two layers namely the deposited layer and the developed layer which are classified in the term of the predominant fouling components on the membrane surface chen et al 2006 the former is the initial fouling layer and is much closer to the membrane surface than the latter the microscale level semi quantitative analysis of the morphological characteristics was provided by sem as shown in fig 4 a the sem results showed that the thickness of the deposited layer in the c mbr was larger than that of the as mbr moreover the deposited layer of the c mbr was seriously compressed with less porosity whereas the deposited layer of the as mbr was fluffy with many more pores the larger thickness and lower number of pores may contribute to the reduction of membrane permeability and meanwhile cause membrane fouling aggravation hence those results implied that the change in the deposited layer characteristics after introducing algae into an mbr may be one of the reasons for the membrane fouling mitigation in the as mbr in addition to the morphological characteristics the surface topography of a sample can be characterized by afm to some extent for afm images the brown color and the yellow color indicate a valley and a peak on the surface respectively as show in fig 4b the peaks and valleys in the as mbr were relatively smoother than those in the c mbr additionally the ra and rq which represent the roughness of the membrane surface quantitatively were 28 1 and 24 2 lower in the as mbr than those of the c mbr respectively further confirming that the membrane surface roughness decreased with the inoculation of algae some studies have reported that a membrane with a rough surface may offer valleys for flocs particles to stack up on leading to pore blockage and subsequent increases in the intensity of membrane fouling iorhemen et al 2016 accordingly the deposited layer with a rougher surface could contribute to further membrane fouling in the c mbr further investigations were conducted to explore the reasons for the different deposited layer characteristics between the as mbr and the c mbr and the floc size and shapes were measured the average floc size of as mbr was 22 9 lower than that of c mbr fig s3 which might contribute to the formation of smoother foulant layer of as mbr additionally compared with the c mbr the parameters of floc morphology in the as mbr including ro ff and ar were much closer to 1 than those in the c mbr the detailed data are shown in table s2 indicating that the flocs in the as mbr were more spherical inerratic and smooth than those in the c mbr fig s4 provides visual evidence of how flocs adhere to the membrane surface it was supposed that when particles were more regularly shaped there was a smaller probability for the particles to deposit in the valley of the rough membranes additionally meng et al 2006 reported that the foulant layer which was composed of the more regularly shaped sludge flocs did not easily accumulate on the surface of the membrane during the filtration process thus the improvement of the floc characteristics from the algal inoculation which resulted in the formation of a thinner deposited layer with a lower roughness on the membrane surface could enhance the membrane permeability in the as mbr in comparison with the deposited layer the developed layer is believed to be caused by increases in the local flux in some regions of the membrane to maintain the fixed average flux and exceeding the critical flux of the dominant foulant biomass hence an insight into the visual and quantified analysis of the developed layer would be helpful for better understanding the influence of algae on the membrane fouling process clsm can provide a visual analysis of the floc matrix with the nondestructive in situ examination of flocs and quantitative information on the inner structure of the foulant layer by digital image analysis to investigate the developed layer of the membrane surface clsm was scanned at 10 μm above the membrane surface chen et al 2006 the images of the perpendicular planes of clsm fig 5 showed that the ensembles including polysaccharides and proteins aggregated into clusters and formed channels in the developed layer in the as mbr fig 5a while a continuous layer was observed in the c mbr fig 5b these large clusters and channels in the developed layer of the as mbr may benefit the flow of water through the membrane with a higher membrane permeability in the as mbr which was in accordance with the observations in the study of chen et al 2006 in which a continuous and compact layer had a negative influence on membrane filtration as shown in the 3d clsm images fig s5 more porous structures were observed in the developed layer of as mbr which is consistent with the observation of large clusters and channels formed in the as mbr additionally it can be seen from fig s5 that the green color representing proteins was dominant in the developed layer of c mbr compared with coexistence of proteins and polysaccharides in the as mbr tian et al 2012 demonstrated that protein could offer a greater barrier to the permeate flow because of its hydrophobicity property contributing to the higher fouling rate in c mbr a further image analysis i e image pro plus 6 0 revealed that the biovolume of the developed layers were increased by 26 3 in the as mbr compared with that in the c mbr this phenomenon appears to be mainly attributable to the longer operation time to reach tmp of 30 kpa than that of c mbr resulting in the accumulation of more biomass in as mbr taking into account the fact that the higher biovolume of the developed layer but the much lower fouling rate were observed in as mbr than those in the c mbr it is expected that the difference in membrane permeability between the two mbrs could be attributed to some architecture characteristics of the developed layer such as the spatial distribution of biomass the porous structures and the ratio of protein to polysaccharides instead of biomass accumulation in summary it can be concluded that the algal inoculation shows positive effects on the improvement of membrane fouling through the reduction of eps concentrations and the modification of the fouling layer properties with thin porous smooth and disconnected characteristics in the as mbr resulting in an increase in the membrane permeability 3 4 microbial community variation 3 4 1 bacterial community variation to provide insight into the mechanisms of efficient wastewater treatment and membrane fouling mitigation in the as mbr phylogenetic analyses were carried out in the two mbrs and the raw sludge raw based upon otu data the alpha diversity was assessed by calculating the diversity indexes the shannon index and the simpson index show community evenness richness estimators the chao1 and abundance based coverage estimator ace show community richness and coverage which show the sequencing depth the results of the biodiversity parameters in this study are shown in table 2 obviously the coverages in both mbrs and raw were more than 0 95 suggesting the validity of the sequencing compared with the c mbr the microbial community diversity indexes estimated by the shannon index and the simpson index were decreased and increased in the as mbr respectively while the richness as represented by chao 1 and ace was lower in the as mbr in the as mbr the bacteria showed the lowest microbial richness and diversity and the distribution of the remaining community became less even this could be attributed to the presence of algae which may change the microenvironment fulfil the algal bacterial ecological relationship and lead to the extinction of some species and an increase of low abundance bacteria in microbial ecological systems it is generally recognized that fewer species and a lower community evenness suggest a well defined internal structure for the dominant species ma et al 2013 therefore the decrease of microbial richness and diversity indicated that some specific dominant bacteria were formed after inoculating the algae hierarchical cluster analysis was performed at the phyla and class levels fig 6 for the phyla level fig 6a planctomycetes proteobacteria verrucomicrobia firmicutes and bacteroidetes were the dominant groups in the two mbrs while the relative abundance of these microorganisms changed during operation the relative abundances of planctomycetes and proteobacteria in the as mbr increased by 8 4 and 5 5 respectively compared with those in c mbr the enrichment of these bacteria could contribute to the higher cod and tn removal in the as mbr additionally another dominant group of phylum the bacteroidetes increased from 3 0 to 4 6 in the presence of algae the bacteroidetes family includes a large number of genes that are related to the degradation of complex macromolecules such as eps abed et al 2007 which could be one of the reasons for the lower eps concentrations in the as mbr interestingly compared with the c mbr the relative abundances of verrucomicrobia and firmicutes showed an opposite situation with the abovementioned bacteria for which the relative abundance decreased after inoculating the algae verrucomicrobia are often found in phosphorus enriched environments lindström et al 2004 which was in accordance with the lower p removal in the c mbr firmicutes have been commonly reported to accelerate the formation of biofilms on membrane surfaces during mbr operation gao et al 2014 hence the more abundant firmicutes could contribute to the easier attachment of sludge onto the membrane in the c mbr further analysis on the class level fig 6b showed that the dominant groups changed due to the change of the microenvironment by algae which varied from planctomycetia alphaproteobacteria and verrucomicrobiae to only planctomycetia and alphaproteobacteria this might be attributed to the presence of algae have a distaste or their activity changing the microenvironment which resulted in the inhibition of the verrucomicrobiae family it is noted that the relative abundances of bacilli decreased after the inoculation of algae which acted as the framework with filamentious as the matrix in the fouling layer that could promote flocs adhering onto the membrane and thereby increase membrane fouling meng et al 2007 yu et al 2014 cytophagia which can enhance the degradation of the high molecular mass fraction of dissolved organic matter such as eps cottrell and kirchman 2000 kirchman 2002 increased by 2 0 in the as mbr compared to that in the c mbr an otu network analysis was employed to evaluate the variation and linkage of species between the microbial communities in the as mbr and the c mbr fig 6c it is obvious that there are four distinctive regions including i ii iii and iv which accounted for 5 2 16 0 17 9 and 60 9 of the total observed otus respectively regions i and iii represented the unique communities of the as mbr and the c mbr respectively regions ii and iv are shared regions between the as mbr and the c mbr and between the two mbrs and the raw respectively the otus in the shared regions were three times higher than those in the unique regions suggesting that the shared otus covered the majority of the samples notably the functional bacteria in the shared otus were higher than those in the unique otus at the class level the functional communities of the as mbr in the shared otus were 34 7 higher than those of the c mbr in view of the above it could be concluded that with the inoculation of algae the variation of the microbial communities mainly occurred in the shared otus rather than in the unique otus to further understand the effect of algae on nutrient removal additional research has been focused on monitoring the amount of pao aob and nob after algal inoculums the iod was measured to quantify the number of active bacteria in the fluorescence image the iod of the pao in the as mbr was quantified to be approximately 543192 which increased by 30 3 compared with the c mbr 417032 the detailed data are shown in table s3 moreover the iod of the aob and nob active bacteria in the sludge of the as mbr were 33 1 and 13 0 higher than those in the c mbr respectively these findings suggested that the functionally active bacteria were enriched after inoculating the algae this phenomenon was in accordance with the finding mentioned above that is algae have a positive effect on the growth of pao aob and nob active bacteria thus improving n c and p removal in the as mbr 3 4 2 algal community variation as mentioned above the algal growth reduced the bacterial diversity and affected the bacterial community structure meanwhile the stimulated bacteria would have a beneficial effect on the growth of the algal community to facilitate the formation of an algal bacterial symbiotic system as shown in table 3 the coverage of each sample was beyond 1 indicating an adequate sequencing depth for the illumina miseq given that the shannon index ace and chao 1 of the as mbr were much higher than those of the raw inoculum raw it could be inferred that the algae community in the as mbr was more even and had a greater richness after living with the bacteria interestingly the bacterial biodiversity in the symbiotic system decreased with the class of algae while the diversity of algae increased on the bacteria stimulate the increase of algal diversity may lead to an improved ability to adapt to the environmental selection pressure of bacterial stimulation resulting from the much larger bacterial community population which would be helpful to construct a symbiotic system of bacteria and algae to further explore the effect of the bacterial population on algal communities the algal phylogenetic classification was identified at class level and genus level the primary algal classes were not shifted significantly in the as mbr compared with raw which were chlorophyceae trebouxiophyceae ulvophyceae dinophyceae and mediophyceae as for the genus level fig 7 the primary genus included acutodesmus sp unidentified chlorophyceae sp ankistrodesmus sp jbna46 sp ochromonas sp unidentified ochromonadales sp paraphysomonas sp auxenochlorella sp chlorella sp unidentified ulvophyceae sp spiniferodinium sp and thalassiosira sp while the primary genus species of algae were not shifted significantly in the as mbr variation in the relative abundance after consorting with the bacteria was observed for example the relative abundance of unidentified chlorophyceae significantly increased from 2 1 to 43 3 which was a stable algal species that volunteered with bacterial interactions auxenochlorella sp which are facultative heterotrophic and prefer an organic carbon substrate over co2 fixation when possible mahapatra et al 2014 wang et al 2014 increased from 1 1 to 2 0 compared with the inoculum it is expected that they can simultaneously drive phototrophy and heterotrophy to utilize both inorganic co2 and organic carbon substrates thus leading to an additive or synergistic effect of the two processes that enhance productivity and the capability of microalgae to assimilate in wastewaters cao et al 2014 moreover chlorella sp was enriched after consorting with the bacteria in the as mbr the family of chlorella sp could assimilate excess phosphorus to promote algal cell growth which plays an important role in the enhancement of phosphorus removal in the as mbr eixler et al 2006 it is easy to note that the relative abundance of acutodesmus sp remarkably decreased from 95 3 to 50 1 which may be attributed to the negative interaction with bacterial growth and thus the inhibition of acutodesmus sp growth occurred in summary the variation of the algal community structure contributed to the cooperative interactions with the bacterial population and further improved the performance of the as mbr through the construction of a symbiotic system of bacteria and algae 4 conclusions the combined as mbr was operated for 100 days in the present investigation the results confirmed the benefits of the as mbr over the c mbr in the aspects of wastewater treatment and membrane fouling alleviation the microbial activity fouling layer morphology and microbial communities were comprehensively illuminated to yield insight into their relationship with the mbr performance the improvement of biological activity contributed to increased nutrient removal efficiencies the reduction in the eps concentration and the lower thickness and roughness of the deposited layer with the higher porosity and larger channels of the polysaccharides and proteins in the developed layers significantly contributed to the membrane fouling mitigation in as mbr the changes of microbial diversity and the enrichment of functional microbes after inoculating the algae were ultimately responsible for the enhanced performance declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

the kinetic of cr vi reduction by oxidized nom nomox under oxic conditions much less is known about the rates and mechanisms of cr vi reduction triggered by nomred under anoxic conditions and the colloidal properties of the reaction products this study provided new information regarding the nomred mediated cr vi reduction and colloidal stability of reduced cr iii particles over a wide range of environmentally relevant anoxic conditions we show that under dark anoxic conditions reduced humic acid hared moieties e g quinone can quickly reduce cr vi to cr iii and the reduced cr iii can subsequently complex with carboxyl groups of ha leading to the formation of stable ha cr iii colloids rates of cr vi reduction by hared are 3 4 orders of magnitude higher than those by oxidized ha haox due primarily to the higher reducing capacity of hared the stable ha cr iii colloids are formed across a range of ha concentrations 8 150 mg c l and ph conditions 6 10 with hydrodynamic diameter in the range of 210 240 nm aberration corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy cs stem and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps confirmed that the particles are composed of ha cr iii the high colloidal stability of ha cr iii particles could be attributed to the enhanced electrosteric stabilization effect from free and adsorbed ha which decreased particle aggregation however the presence of divalent cations ca2 and mg2 promoted particle aggregation at ph 6 these new findings are valuable for our fundamental understanding of the fate and transport of cr in organic rich anoxic

anoxic conditions aliquots of these oxidized ha suspensions were chemically reduced using 5 h2 in the presence of a pd catalyst 5 wt on al2o3 spheres 1 g l sigma aldrich in an anoxic glovebox 95 n2 and 5 h2 coy laboratory products inc mi as described previously liao et al 2017b 2019 the resulting suspensions were referred to as reduced has ahared and ppshared stock suspensions of both oxidized

described previously tamura et al 1974 the electron carrying capacity of each ha was determined as the difference between the fe ii concentration of the reduced and oxidized ha samples additional information including elemental composition 13c nuclear magnetic resonance nmr and specific ultraviolet absorbance suva254 are given elsewhere liao et al 2017a 2019 li et al 2019 a summary is also provided in table s1 in the supplementary material 2 2 batch experiments the batch experimental conditions are summarized in table s2 all batch experiments were performed in 50 ml capped polypropylene bottles that were continuously stirred with teflon coated magnetic stir bars at a speed of 650 rpm and were maintained at a constant temperature 25 0 5 c inside the anoxic glovebox the reactors were shielded with aluminum foil to exclude any photochemical reactions all experiments and sample preparations were conducted inside an anoxic glovebox with less than 0 1 ppm of gaseous o2 all solutions and reagents were made in the anaerobic chamber using deoxygenated water which was prepared by sparging ultrapure water with ultrapure n2 for 4 h and then equilibrating with the anoxic atmosphere in the chamber for at least 12 h a cr vi stock solution 0 1 g l was prepared from k2cr2o7 for most experiments the ph of the reaction suspension was maintained at ph 6 using 5 mm 2

caps sigma aldrich for ph 10 these ph buffers were selected because they are non complexing agents that have been widely used to study cr redox reactions wadhawan et al 2013 pan et al 2017a a constant background ionic strength was maintained by the 5 mm buffers without the addition of any other electrolytes reactions were initiated by adding 1 mg l cr vi from the stock solution to a vigorously stirred solution containing hared ahared and ppshared working suspension at concentrations ranging from 0 150 mg c l and 5 mm mes ph 6 in an anoxic glovebox the dissolved oxygen concentrations in the suspensions were below the detection limit 0 01 mg l of the do probe throughout the course of experiment periods separate control experiments with haox 80 mg c l ahaox and 150 mg c l ppshaox were conducted under identical conditions as described above additional experiments with a fixed ahared of 40 mg c l were performed to evaluate the effects of ph 5 10 ionic strength 0 5 100 mm and composition nacl cacl2 and mgcl2 on the kinetics of cr vi reduction and colloidal stability of formed cr iii products at ph 6 the effect of multiple cr vi spikes was also investigated in separate experiments the experiments involved spiking 1 mg l cr vi with 80 mg c l ahared at ph 6 and monitoring cr vi concentration evolution over time once there was no detectable cr vi remaining in the suspension another spike of cr vi was added all other experimental conditions were the same as those used for the initial experiments described above suspension aliquots were periodically collected from each batch reactor at desired time intervals using a 2 ml polypropylene syringe subsamples of 1 ml were filtered using a 0 22 μm syringe filter pes millipore and the filtrate was analyzed immediately for aqueous cr vi and total aqueous cr the remaining sample in the syringe was dispensed as an unfiltered suspension and used for total cr analyses samples for measurement of total aqueous cr and total cr were acidified in 4 hno3 and stored at 4 c in the dark 2 3 aqueous and solid phase analysis cr vi concentrations in the samples were measured spectrophotometrically using a diphenyl carbazide dpc method at a wavelength of 540 nm total aqueous cr and total cr concentrations were determined using an agilent 7700 series inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms cr iii concentrations were quantified as the difference between total cr and cr vi concentrations truly dissolved 10000 da roughly equal to 1 3 nm colloidal 10000 da 220 nm and particulate 220 nm cr cr vi

defined as particles ranging from 10000 da to 220 nm the particle size and zeta potential of the suspensions collected after cr vi reduction were probed by dynamic light scattering dls using a

publication li et al 2019 the surface properties of the resulting cr iii products were characterized by attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared atr ftir spectroscopy and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps solid samples were prepared by centrifugation and then freeze dried under anoxic conditions atr ftir spectra were recorded using a thermo nicolet is50 ft ir spectrometer equipped with a diamond internal reflection element ire samples were prepared on the atr cell by placing the freeze dried solids evenly onto the diamond crystal surface with a diameter of 3 mm under an argon environment a dry cell purged with argon gas was used as a background for all sample data were collected over the 4000 500 cm 1 range at a resolution of 4 cm 1 spectra were proceeded using the omnic software package xps spectra were collected using a phi quantera sxm scanning x ray microprobe with an al mono source at a 100 μm x ray spot size the binding energies were calibrated using c 1s at 284 8 ev and the spectra were proceeded using multipak v9 8 software 2 4 data analysis an empirical pseudofirst order rate law proposed by zheng et al 2012 was employed to simulate the reduction of cr vi by hared in this study the model was established with the assumption that cr vi reduction undergoes multiple pathways involving different functional groups with different reactivities see discussion below the pseudofirst order kinetic model can be described using the following parallel reactions 1 cr vi 1 reductant 1 k 1 c r i i i 2 cr vi 2 reductant 2 k 2 c r i i i where reductants 1 and 2 represent different types of reducing moieties or reactive sites in hared combining equations 1 and 2 yields 3 cr vi cr vi 0 a e x p k 1 t 1 a e x p k 2 t where a and 1 a are fractions of hared reacted with cr vi with rate constants of k 1 and k 2 respectively which can be determined by fitting the experimental data using a nonlinear least squares algorithm 3 results and discussion 3 1 reduction of cr vi by nomred the result from anoxic batch experiments indicated that hared is a potent reductant of cr vi at the near neutral ph 6 fig 1 a ha free control experiments showed no cr vi reduction by pd h2 treated solution in the glovebox over the duration of the experiments not shown suggesting that reductants other than ha are absent although oxidized ha or fulvic acid was previously reported to initiate cr vi reduction wittbrodt and palmer 1995 this was not obvious at ph 6 fig s1 likely due to the time needed to reduce cr vi weeks to months significantly longer than the time of 27 h used in this study in contrast the reduction of cr vi by hared is rapid with rates on a time scale of minutes k 1 0 36 0 72 min 1 fig 1a and b table s2 rates of cr vi reduction by hared ahared and ppshared are 3 4 orders of magnitude higher than those by haox fig s1 table s2 primarily due to the higher reducing capacity of hared jiang and kappler 2008 this is consistent with previous observations that hared is much more reactive than haox for mediating fe iii and hg ii reduction under anoxic conditions gu et al 2011 zheng et al 2012 liao et al 2017b concentrations of intrinsic fe ii 0 06 3 6 μm present in hared working suspensions were much lower than the added cr vi concentration 17 8 μm and thus the contribution of intrinsic fe ii to the observed cr vi reduction appears negligible for both ahared and ppshared the extent of cr vi reduction increased with increasing initial hared concentration fig 1a and b which supports our contention that increasing hared concentration would lead to an increase in the concentration of redox active functional groups available for cr vi reduction this is first direct quantification of the rates of cr vi reduction by hared under conditions relevant to anoxic subsurface environments cr vi reduction by hared may undergo several pathways that involve multiple types of redox active sites with different reactivities evidence from previous studies suggested that two quinone like structures q1 and q2 and a non quinone structure accounted for the total electron carrying capacity of hared ratasuk and nanny 2007 q1 is referred as quinone moieties have a neighboring electron withdrawing group while q2 contains either no substituents near the quinone or had nearby electron donating groups with substituents ratasuk and nanny 2007 for both ahared and ppshared aqueous cr vi concentrations decreased quickly within the first 30 min and then dropped slowly until a steady state is attained fig 1a and b a two site pseudofirst order rate model equation 3 effectively described the reduction of cr vi by hared under all conditions tested r2 0 93 at conditions similar to ours ph 7 anoxic zheng et al 2012 reported that the same two site model could also simulate the dynamics of hg ii reduction by nomred the initial rapid drop in cr vi concentrations that we observed is likely caused by reduced quinone sites q1 and q2 because quinones have been identified as the principal reducible moieties in ha with reactivities much higher than the bulk of reduction sites in ha scott et al 1998 jiang and kappler 2008 aeschbacher et al 2010 the subsequently slow cr vi reduction k 2 0 009 0 457 h 1 table s2 may have been controlled by non quinone compounds e g thiol or bisulfide which accounted for a minor fraction of the electrons that may be transferred from hared to cr vi for a given hared concentration ahared is found to be more effective than ppashred in reducing cr vi fig 1a and b these observations could be attributed to the different chemical and functional properties of ha of different origins table s1 shows that aha had a higher electron carrying capacity 3895 448 vs 2216 229 μeq gc and a larger amount of organically bound sulfur 3 5 vs 0 6 compared to ppash thus the higher density of the redox active functional groups e g quinone like moieties and reduced forms of sulfur non quinone structure in aha are likely responsible for the observed higher extent and rate of cr vi reduction by ahared multiple spiking experiments showed a decrease in cr vi reduction with each successive cr vi spike fig 1c however the rate after the forth cr vi spike was still 4 orders of magnitude higher than the rate of cr vi reduction by haox k 1 1 67 10 1 versus 5 83 10 5 min 1 suggesting that a portion of the redox active moieties in ha persisted and could further donate electrons to cr vi this is similar to previous observations that the reduced moieties in hared had not been completely oxidized during oxygenation events bauer and kappler 2009 3 2 effect of ph and common cations on cr vi reduction cr vi reduction by ahared is faster at lower ph and generally decreases with increasing ph fig 2 a for example at a loading of 40 mg c l ahared 80 cr vi reduction occurred within 30 min at ph 5 whereas only 48 cr vi reduction was observed at ph 10 after 3 h fig 2a this ph dependence of cr vi reduction is consistent with earlier reports showing that the rate of cr vi reduction by nom decreased with increasing ph from 2 to 7 under oxic conditions wittbrodt and palmer 1995 an increase in ph could lower the reduction potential of the cr vi cr iii half reaction lide 2000 thus cr vi could be a weaker oxidant at higher ph further carboxyl groups of ha can introduce negative charge with increased density with increasing ph fig s2 lower cr vi reduction at higher ph might be due to the stronger unfavorable electrostatic interactions between negatively charged cr vi pka 0 74 pkb 6 50 and ha which could lead to a higher activation energy slowing down the electron transfer reactions between hared and cr vi gu and chen 2003 at ph 7 the rate of cr vi reduction was slightly higher than at ph 6 fig 2a table s2 this deviation of the general trend of cr vi reduction versus ph was probably attributed to the higher reactivity of quinones available for cr vi reduction at ph 7 lian et al 2016 the presence of common cations na ca2 and mg2 enhanced the reduction of cr vi by ahared fig 2b d the extent and rate of cr vi reduction increased with increasing na concentration fig 2b ca2 and mg2 also promoted cr vi reduction but the greatest increases in the reduction rate occurred at lower concentrations i e 0 5 mm ca2 mg2 fig 2c and d divalent cations ca2 and mg2 could bind with the carboxyl groups of ha through complexation reactions that affect the ha surface charge and binding sites for other competing metal ions hering and morel 1988 wall and choppin 2003 liao et al 2019 zeta potential measurements showed that all three cations lowered the negative charge of ha but divalent ca2 and mg2 had much more pronounced effects for neutralizing ha s negative surface charge than monovalent na figs s3 and s4 sorption of anionic cr vi to ha is thus less electrostatically unfavorable and may contribute to the observed rates of cr vi reduction liao et al 2019 reported an inhibitory effect of ca2 and mg2 on the redox reactivity of ha and attributed it to the complexation and aggregation of ha by ca2 and mg2 that blocked the active site of ha and suppressed the electron transfer reactions the promotional effect of ca2 and mg2 on cr vi reduction by hared observed in this study suggested that the redox active groups e g quinone and sulfur containing sites may not be influenced by ca2 and mg2 and that the reduction of cr vi by the redox active groups was much faster than the aggregation of ha by ca2 and mg2 at concentrations 0 5 10 mm tested in this study 3 3 formation of nom cr iii colloids upon cr vi reduction cr vi reduction by hared is accompanied by colloidal cr iii formation even when cr vi concentration dropped to a very low concentration we still need to consider the particle stability of reduced cr iii because cr iii species could be reoxidized to toxic cr vi when they are exposed to oxidizing conditions landrot et al 2012 concentrations of cr iii observed in suspensions appeared to correlate with the rate of cr vi reduction figs s5 and s6 for all experiments the aqueous cr iii 220 nm and total cr iii concentrations rose rapidly within the first 30 min and then gradually approached a plateau figs s5 and s6 the ratio of aqueous cr iii to total cr iii was observed to be 0 87 for all ha concentration conditions suggesting that aqueous cr iii dominated further size partitioning results clearly demonstrated that truly dissolved cr iii 1 3 nm was negligible after 10 kda membrane ultrafiltration and most of cr iii was present in colloidal form 10000 da 220 nm fig 3 a and b in contrast to cr iii the remaining cr vi after reduction was primarily present as truly dissolved form with cr vi concentrations in the filtered fraction 10000 da being quite high fig s7 colloidal cr iii constituted as much as 80 99 of the total cr iii fraction in the suspensions regardless of the concentration and origin of ha fig 3a and b this is similar to prior work of wu et al 2001 who reported that substantial portions 99 of the operationally defined dissolved metal e g fe iii were present in colloidal phase in marine environments formation of ha cr iii colloids is likely due to the complexation of cr iii with ha followed by polymerization of ha although cr iii has a low solubility at neutral ph e g 10 9 m sass and rai 1987 the measured colloidal cr iii concentrations in this study were much higher than the predicted solubility of cr oh 3 s which may be ascribed to the formation of ha cr iii complexes kaczynski and kieber 1994 fukushima et al 1995 complexation of cr iii by ha may inhibit extensive hydrolysis of cr iii to cr oh 3 and thus inhibit particle aggregation to favor smaller particle sizes kaczynski and kieber 1994 icopini and long 2002 dls results support this proposition showing that the hydrodynamic diameters of suspensions were in the range of 210 240 nm fig 3c and d and remained largely unchanged over 60 days zeta potential measurements provided further evidence for the colloidal stabilization of ha cr iii complexes the zeta potentials of suspensions for all ha concentration conditions show significant negative surface charges 41 2 49 1 mv fig 3c and d supporting the observed high dispersion of ha cr iii colloids due to strong electrostatic stabilization effect from free ha adsorbed on the surfaces of colloids liao et al 2017a pan et al 2017a this stabilization mechanism has also been observed for the formation of ha fe iii colloids liao et al 2017a ph had a marginal influence on the formation and colloidal stability of ha cr iii colloids fig 4 a and b an increase in ph from 6 to 10 did not significantly alter the size fractionation of cr iii and colloidal cr iii remained the dominant cr iii fraction fig 4a this is consistent with dls results fig 4b which showed that the hydrodynamic diameters of suspensions were comparable 217 261 nm at ph 6 10 this is because the formed ha cr iii colloids under these conditions were highly negatively charged 45 7 72 2 mv fig s2 resulting in strong electrostatic repulsive forces between particles and thus preventing their aggregation in contrast the zeta potential of the suspensions at ph 5 was 27 2 mv a value near the typical threshold of 30 mv via derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory elimelech et al 1995 and consequently aggregation of ha cr iii colloids to larger particles could occur readily this is confirmed by the relatively low colloidal cr iii concentration and larger hydrodynamic diameter of suspensions at ph 5 fig 4a and b divalent cations ca2 and mg2 affected the ha cr iii colloids formation in a concentration dependent manner fig 4e h at ca2 mg2 1 mm the ha cr iii suspensions were colloidal stable however a substantial decrease in colloidal cr iii concentration and increase in particle size were observed as the ca2 mg2 concentrations increased from 1 to 10 mm fig 4e h the aggregation and destabilization of ha cr iii colloids at higher ca2 and mg2 concentrations can be explained by electrostatic interactions through dlvo theory elimelech et al 1995 zeta potential results showed a dramatic drop in surface negative charge as a function of increasing ca2 and mg2 concentrations fig s4 for example at 10 mm ca2 mg2 the ha cr iii suspensions were only slightly negatively charged being 14 0 8 mv for ca2 and 16 8 2 4 mv for mg2 leading to very weak repulsive energy between particles and thus accelerating particle aggregation the extent of the decrease in colloidal cr iii concentrations due to aggregation was more pronounced for ca2 than for mg2 fig 4e h likely due to the stronger complexation and bridging effects of ca2 compared to mg2 philippe and schaumann 2014 in contrast to ca2 and mg2 the presence of na at concentrations between 1 and 100 mm had a minimal effect on the formation and aggregation of ha cr iii colloids fig 4c and d due to the high negative charge of the suspensions 35 mv fig s3 3 4 characterization of nom cr iii colloids high resolution cs stem provided nanoscale information on the morphology and microscopic structure of ha cr iii colloids formed at ph 6 fig 5 the high angle annular dark field haadf stem images showed that the colloidal particles for both aha cr and ppsha cr samples exhibited irregular morphology with average primary diameters between 5 and 50 nm fig 5a and b the fast fourier transform fft patterns the insets in fig 5a and b showed no obvious lattice fringes for both ha cr iii colloids indicative of poor crystallinity or amorphous materials haadf stem eds mappings showed similar elemental distribution of c and cr across the imaged regions fig 5 indicating the intimate association of ha with cr at the nanoscale as the electron intensity of haadf stem imaging is approximately proportional to the atomic number pennycook and nellist 2011 the brighter spots in haadf images must correspond to cr given that cr has a larger atomic number compared to c 24 versus 6 fig 5 eds mappings confirmed this proposition showing that c was either homogenously or heterogeneously enriched on the surface of electron dense areas that were likely composed of ha cr nanoparticles or cluster fig 5 further evidence in support of this conclusion is provided below xps spectroscopy was used to further characterize the chemical state and distribution of cr present on the particle near surface fig 6 a c spectra of cr iii as crcl3 solid and cr vi as k2cr2o7 solid were provided as references for comparison consistent with the findings of aqueous phase analysis as discussed above the cr 2p xps spectra of solids from reaction of cr vi with hared both ahared and ppshared at ph 6 revealed that cr vi was completely reduced to cr iii as there was no significant cr vi feature peak e g 579 6 ev fig 6a fitting the high resolution cr 2p 3 2 spectra further confirmed the domination of cr iii on the particle near surface fig 6a which is consistent with prior x ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy xanes measurements that showed that the solid products of cr vi reduction by ha material contained solely cr iii jiang et al 2014 because xps typically probes the topmost 1 10 nm of samples we then performed a xps depth profiling technique to probe the spatial distribution of cr as a function of probing depth from surface to 100 nm depth fig 6b and c results indicated that cr iii dominated at all depths tested and the intensity of cr iii increased with increasing probing depth for both aha cr and ppsha cr samples fig 6b and c suggesting the relative enrichment of ha on the surface of ha cr iii colloids this is consistent with the haadf stem eds results described above fig 5 the ha rich surface could explain the high colloidal stability of ha cr iii particles observed under our experimental conditions atr ftir spectroscopy provided molecular information on the binding of ha with reduced cr iii for colloidal ha cr iii complex formation fig 6d the spectra of samples from the reaction of hared with cr vi were much different from the initial unreacted hared the two broad peaks at 1596 and 1391 cm 1 in the unreacted hared suggest asymmetric and symmetric vibrations for coo groups sharma et al 2010 after completion of cr vi reduction the asymmetric coo peak at 1596 cm 1 shifted to a higher wavenumber of 1636 cm 1 and the intensity of this peak decreased for both aha cr and ppsha cr samples fig 6d such a large shift and decrease in the intensity of coo stretching band is likely attributed to the formation of carboxylate metal bonds through a ligand exchange mechanism sharma et al 2010 chen et al 2014 in addition the spectra for samples after reactions resulted in a significant decrease in the intensity of a symmetric coo peak at 1400 cm 1 fig 6d further suggesting that carboxyl groups were involved in the complexation of ha with reduced cr iii these observations are consistent with recent extended x ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy exafs results showing that cr iii formed stable polynuclear complexes with nom at ph 5 primarily through carboxyl functional groups gustafsson et al 2014 further the broad new peaks at 1205 and 1113 cm 1 after reactions may be attributed to the cr o c bridge vibrations or cr oh stretching vibration nakamoto 1978 the shape of the spectra for both aha cr and ppsha cr samples were similar but aha cr sample yielded a higher peak intensity at 1205 and 1113 cm 1 fig 6d 3 5 environmental implications redox transformation of nomox to nomred by microorganisms or geochemical reductants occurs ubiquitously in anoxic environments lovley et al 1996 gu et al 2011 liao et al 2017b and the interplays between nomred and cr vi are of particular importance for better understanding of cr speciation and mobility in subsurface environments this study extended our fundamental knowledge of the interaction of nom with cr vi from oxic conditions to anoxic conditions and provided clear evidence that nomred exerts an important control on the reduction of cr vi and stabilization of colloidal cr iii particles under anoxic conditions such complex cr cycles triggered by nomred are likely widespread in anoxic geochemical conditions and suggest that the fate and transport of cr may be more complicated than previously recognized as expected cr vi that is diffused from oxic zones across oxic anoxic transition interfaces into anoxic environments can be quickly reduced by nomred rates of cr vi reduction by nomred table s2 are considerably faster than those observed for microbial cr vi reduction pathways e g 3 81 8 95 10 3 min 1 in anoxic subsurface environments gu and chen 2003 liu et al 2002 although cr vi reduction by nom has been posited as a sink for cr wittbrodt and palmer 1995 jiang et al 2014 the reduced cr iii produced at lower ca2 and mg2 concentrations is resistant to precipitate due to the formation of stable nom cr iii colloids which are composed of small particles that stayed suspended in water for months such high colloidal stability highlights that colloid facilitated transport of cr iii particles may be a significant process governing the mobility of cr in subsurface given the dynamic redox nature of subsurface environments transport of nom cr iii colloids from anoxic environments across interfaces and into more oxygenated zones could enhance the probability of future reoxidation of cr iii to toxic highly mobile cr vi by oxidants such as manganese oxides and chloramine disinfectants landrot et al 2012 chebeir and liu 2016 pan et al 2017b liao et al 2020 thereby spreading contamination however nom cr iii colloids could be aggregated and destabilized by the presence of higher ca2 and mg2 concentrations thus promoting cr iii removal from the water column since organically complexed cr iii represents an important part of the biogeochemical cycle of cr puzon et al 2005 we proposed that colloid facilitated cr iii transport needs to be considered within the overall theoretical framework for reactive transport of cr under organic rich redox dynamic conditions further work is needed to extend our framework by deciphering the aggregation deposition transport and transformation of nom cr iii colloids in more realistic subsurface environments 4 conclusions this study to our knowledge is the first report elucidating hared mediated cr vi reduction mechanism and colloidal stability of reduced cr iii products under circumneutral anoxic conditions the most striking observation is that hared triggered rapid reduction of cr vi and formation of stable organic cr iii colloids over a wide range of anoxic conditions specifically the reduced quinone moieties present in hared can quickly transfer electrons to cr vi with cr vi reduction occurring on the time scale of minutes at neutral ph conditions 6 8 the presence of na 1 100 mm ca2 0 5 10 mm and mg2 0 5 10 mm enhanced cr vi reduction at ph 6 reduced cr iii can then complex with carboxyl groups of ha to form stable ha cr iii colloids that persisted in water for at least 2 months with negligible aggregation due to strong electrostatic interactions between particles however the presence of ca2 and mg2 at higher concentrations e g 10 mm promoted particle aggregation and thus suppressed ha cr iii colloid formation taken together our results provided new insights into the understanding of the fate and transport of cr in organic rich anoxic environments which is also

17844,natural organic matter nom can influence the toxicity and speciation of chromium cr in subsurface through redox reactions and complexation under anoxic conditions nom can be reduced by microorganisms or geochemical reductants and the reduced nom nomred represents a large reservoir of organic matter observed in anoxic sediments and water while the current body of work has established the kinetic of cr vi reduction by oxidized nom nomox under oxic conditions much less is known about the rates and mechanisms of cr vi reduction triggered by nomred under anoxic conditions and the colloidal properties of the reaction products this study provided new information regarding the nomred mediated cr vi reduction and colloidal stability of reduced cr iii particles over a wide range of environmentally relevant anoxic conditions we show that under dark anoxic conditions reduced humic acid hared moieties e g quinone can quickly reduce cr vi to cr iii and the reduced cr iii can subsequently complex with carboxyl groups of ha leading to the formation of stable ha cr iii colloids rates of cr vi reduction by hared are 3 4 orders of magnitude higher than those by oxidized ha haox due primarily to the higher reducing capacity of hared the stable ha cr iii colloids are formed across a range of ha concentrations 8 150 mg c l and ph conditions 6 10 with hydrodynamic diameter in the range of 210 240 nm aberration corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy cs stem and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps confirmed that the particles are composed of ha cr iii the high colloidal stability of ha cr iii particles could be attributed to the enhanced electrosteric stabilization effect from free and adsorbed ha which decreased particle aggregation however the presence of divalent cations ca2 and mg2 promoted particle aggregation at ph 6 these new findings are valuable for our fundamental understanding of the fate and transport of cr in organic rich anoxic environments which also have substantial implications for the development and optimization of subsurface cr sequestration technology graphical abstract image 1 keywords reduced nom cr vi reduction

anoxic conditions aliquots of these oxidized ha suspensions were chemically reduced using 5 h2 in the presence of a pd catalyst 5 wt on al2o3 spheres 1 g l sigma aldrich in an anoxic glovebox 95 n2 and 5 h2 coy laboratory products inc mi as described previously liao et al 2017b 2019 the resulting suspensions were referred to as reduced has ahared and ppshared stock suspensions of both oxidized and reduced has were stored in an anoxic glovebox in the dark before use concentrations of ha were determined using a total organic carbon toc analyzer multi n c 3100 analytik jena the fe content for each ha was determined using the method presented by lovley and blunt harris 1999 the redox capacity of has was quantified following a modified procedure described by lovely et al 1996 briefly 5 mm fe iii citrate was mixed with an aliquot of ha stock suspensions and then allowed to equilibrate on a rotator for 1 h before an aliquot was taken for fe ii determination using a 1 10 phenanthroline assay described previously tamura et al 1974 the electron carrying capacity of each ha was determined as the difference between the fe ii concentration of the reduced and oxidized ha samples additional information including elemental composition 13c nuclear magnetic resonance nmr and specific ultraviolet absorbance suva254 are given elsewhere liao et al 2017a 2019 li et al 2019 a summary is also provided in table s1 in the supplementary material 2 2 batch experiments the batch experimental conditions are summarized in table s2 all batch experiments were performed in 50 ml capped polypropylene bottles that were continuously stirred with teflon coated magnetic stir bars at a speed of 650 rpm and were maintained at a constant temperature 25 0 5 c inside the anoxic glovebox the reactors were shielded with aluminum foil to exclude any photochemical reactions all experiments and sample preparations were conducted inside an anoxic glovebox with less than 0 1 ppm of gaseous o2 all solutions and reagents were made in the anaerobic chamber using deoxygenated water which was prepared by sparging ultrapure water with ultrapure n2 for 4 h and then equilibrating with the anoxic atmosphere in the chamber for at least 12 h a cr vi stock solution 0 1 g l was prepared from k2cr2o7 for most experiments the ph of the reaction suspension was maintained at ph 6 using 5 mm 2 morpholinoethansulfonic acid monohydrate mes sigma aldrich buffer for selected experiments 5 mm n n diethylpiperazine depp sigma aldrich was used as the buffer for ph 5 0 5 mm 4 2 hydroxyethyl 1 piperazineethanesulfonic acid hepes sigma aldrich was used for ph 7 and 8 5 mm n cyclohexyl 2 aminoethanesulfonic acid ches sigma aldrich for ph 9 and 5 mm n cyclohexyl 3 aminopropanesulfonic acid caps sigma aldrich for ph 10 these ph buffers were selected because they are non complexing agents that have been widely used to study cr redox reactions wadhawan et al 2013 pan et al 2017a a constant background ionic strength was maintained by the 5 mm buffers without the addition of any other electrolytes reactions were initiated by adding 1 mg l cr vi from the stock solution to a vigorously stirred solution containing hared ahared and ppshared working suspension at concentrations ranging from 0 150 mg c l and 5 mm mes ph 6 in an anoxic glovebox the dissolved oxygen concentrations in the suspensions were below the detection limit 0 01 mg l of the do probe throughout the course of experiment periods separate control experiments with haox 80 mg c l ahaox and 150 mg c l ppshaox were conducted under identical conditions as described above additional experiments with a fixed ahared of 40 mg c l were performed to evaluate the effects of ph 5 10 ionic strength 0 5 100 mm and composition nacl cacl2 and mgcl2 on the kinetics of cr vi reduction and colloidal stability of formed cr iii products at ph 6 the effect of multiple cr vi spikes was also investigated in separate experiments the experiments involved spiking 1 mg l cr vi with 80 mg c l ahared at ph 6 and monitoring cr vi concentration evolution over time once there was no detectable cr vi remaining in the suspension another spike of cr vi was added all other experimental conditions were the same as those used for the initial experiments described above suspension aliquots were periodically collected from each batch reactor at desired time intervals using a 2 ml polypropylene syringe subsamples of 1 ml were filtered using a 0 22 μm syringe filter pes millipore and the filtrate was analyzed immediately for aqueous cr vi and total aqueous cr the remaining sample in the syringe was dispensed as an unfiltered suspension and used for total cr analyses samples for measurement of total aqueous cr and total cr were acidified in 4 hno3 and stored at 4 c in the dark 2 3 aqueous and solid phase analysis cr vi concentrations in the samples were measured spectrophotometrically using a diphenyl carbazide dpc method at a wavelength of 540 nm total aqueous cr and total cr concentrations were determined using an agilent 7700 series inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms cr iii concentrations were quantified as the difference between total cr and cr vi concentrations truly dissolved 10000 da roughly equal to 1 3 nm colloidal 10000 da 220 nm and particulate 220 nm cr cr vi and cr iii were fractionated from samples collected at the end of each batch experiment using 10 kda ultrafiltration emd millipore and 0 22 μm filtration pes millipore in this study colloids were defined as particles ranging from 10000 da to 220 nm the particle size and zeta potential of the suspensions collected after cr vi reduction were probed by dynamic light scattering dls using a zetasizer nano malvern instruments scanning transmission electron microscopy stem samples collected after cr vi reduction were prepared by depositing 10 μl of suspension onto a 10 nm thick window of silicon nitride membrane sn100 simpore inc usa followed by evaporation of the remaining water with deoxygenated gas inside the glovebox particles were imaged using an ultrahigh resolution double spherical aberration corrected stem at 300 kv cs corrected stem thermo fisher titan themis g2 60e300 details of stem and energy dispersive x ray edx measurements can be found in our previous publication li et al 2019 the surface properties of the resulting cr iii products were characterized by attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared atr ftir spectroscopy and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps solid samples were prepared by centrifugation and then freeze dried under anoxic conditions atr ftir spectra were recorded using a thermo nicolet is50 ft ir spectrometer equipped with a diamond internal reflection element ire samples were prepared on the atr cell by placing the freeze dried solids evenly onto the diamond crystal surface with a diameter of 3 mm under an argon environment a dry cell purged with argon gas was used as a background for all sample data were collected over the 4000 500 cm 1 range at a resolution of 4 cm 1 spectra were proceeded using the omnic software package xps spectra were collected using a phi quantera sxm scanning x ray microprobe with an al mono source at a 100 μm x ray spot size the binding energies were calibrated using c 1s at 284 8 ev and the spectra were proceeded using multipak v9 8 software 2 4 data analysis an empirical pseudofirst order rate law proposed by zheng et al 2012 was employed to simulate the reduction of cr vi by hared in this study the model was established with the assumption that cr vi reduction undergoes multiple pathways involving different functional groups with different reactivities see discussion below the pseudofirst order kinetic model can be described using the following parallel reactions 1 cr vi 1 reductant 1 k 1 c r i i i 2 cr vi 2 reductant 2 k 2 c r i i i where reductants 1 and 2 represent different types of reducing moieties or reactive sites in hared combining equations 1 and 2 yields 3 cr vi cr vi 0 a e x p k 1 t 1 a e x p k 2 t where a and 1 a are fractions of hared reacted with cr vi with rate constants of k 1 and k 2 respectively which can be determined by fitting the experimental data using a nonlinear least squares algorithm 3 results and discussion 3 1 reduction of cr vi by nomred the result from anoxic batch experiments indicated that hared is a potent reductant of cr vi at the near neutral ph 6 fig 1 a ha free control experiments showed no cr vi reduction by pd h2 treated solution in the glovebox over the duration of the experiments not shown suggesting that reductants other than ha are absent although oxidized ha or fulvic acid was previously reported to initiate cr vi reduction wittbrodt and palmer 1995 this was not obvious at ph 6 fig s1 likely due to the time needed to reduce cr vi weeks to months significantly longer than the time of 27 h used in this study in contrast the reduction of cr vi by hared is rapid with rates on a time scale of minutes k 1 0 36 0 72 min 1 fig 1a and b table s2 rates of cr vi reduction by hared ahared and ppshared are 3 4 orders of magnitude higher than those by haox fig s1 table s2 primarily due to the higher reducing capacity of hared jiang and kappler 2008 this is consistent with previous observations that hared is much more reactive than haox for mediating fe iii and hg ii reduction under anoxic conditions gu et al 2011 zheng et al 2012 liao et al 2017b concentrations of intrinsic fe ii 0 06 3 6 μm present in hared working suspensions were much lower than the added cr vi concentration 17 8 μm and thus the contribution of intrinsic fe ii to the observed cr vi reduction appears negligible for both ahared and ppshared the extent of cr vi reduction increased with increasing initial hared concentration fig 1a and b which supports our contention that increasing hared concentration would lead to an increase in the concentration of redox active functional groups available for cr vi reduction this is first direct quantification of the rates of cr vi reduction by hared under conditions relevant to anoxic subsurface environments cr vi reduction by hared may undergo several pathways that involve multiple types of redox active sites with different reactivities evidence from previous studies suggested that two quinone like structures q1 and q2 and a non quinone structure accounted for the total electron carrying capacity of hared ratasuk and nanny 2007 q1 is referred as quinone moieties have a neighboring electron withdrawing group while q2 contains either no substituents near the quinone or had nearby electron donating groups with substituents ratasuk and nanny 2007 for both ahared and ppshared aqueous cr vi concentrations decreased quickly within the first 30 min and then dropped slowly until a steady state is attained fig 1a and b a two site pseudofirst order rate model equation 3 effectively described the reduction of cr vi by hared under all conditions tested r2 0 93 at conditions similar to ours ph 7 anoxic zheng et al 2012 reported that the same two site model could also simulate the dynamics of hg ii reduction by nomred the initial rapid drop in cr vi concentrations that we observed is likely caused by reduced quinone sites q1 and q2 because quinones have been identified as the principal reducible moieties in ha with reactivities much higher than the bulk of reduction sites in ha scott et al 1998 jiang and kappler 2008 aeschbacher et al 2010 the subsequently slow cr vi reduction k 2 0 009 0 457 h 1 table s2 may have been controlled by non quinone compounds e g thiol or bisulfide which accounted for a minor fraction of the electrons that may be transferred from hared to cr vi for a given hared concentration ahared is found to be more effective than ppashred in reducing cr vi fig 1a and b these observations could be attributed to the different chemical and functional properties of ha of different origins table s1 shows that aha had a higher electron carrying capacity 3895 448 vs 2216 229 μeq gc and a larger amount of organically bound sulfur 3 5 vs 0 6 compared to ppash thus the higher density of the redox active functional groups e g quinone like moieties and reduced forms of sulfur non quinone structure in aha are likely responsible for the observed higher extent and rate of cr vi reduction by ahared multiple spiking experiments showed a decrease in cr vi reduction with each successive cr vi spike fig 1c however the rate after the forth cr vi spike was still 4 orders of magnitude higher than the rate of cr vi reduction by haox k 1 1 67 10 1 versus 5 83 10 5 min 1 suggesting that a portion of the redox active moieties in ha persisted and could further donate electrons to cr vi this is similar to previous observations that the reduced moieties in hared had not been completely oxidized during oxygenation events bauer and kappler 2009 3 2 effect of ph and common cations on cr vi reduction cr vi reduction by ahared is faster at lower ph and generally decreases with increasing ph fig 2 a for example at a loading of 40 mg c l ahared 80 cr vi reduction occurred within 30 min at ph 5 whereas only 48 cr vi reduction was observed at ph 10 after 3 h fig 2a this ph dependence of cr vi reduction is consistent with earlier reports showing that the rate of cr vi reduction by nom decreased with increasing ph from 2 to 7 under oxic conditions wittbrodt and palmer 1995 an increase in ph could lower the reduction potential of the cr vi cr iii half reaction lide 2000 thus cr vi could be a weaker oxidant at higher ph further carboxyl groups of ha can introduce negative charge with increased density with increasing ph fig s2 lower cr vi reduction at higher ph might be due to the stronger unfavorable electrostatic interactions between negatively charged cr vi pka 0 74 pkb 6 50 and ha which could lead to a higher activation energy slowing down the electron transfer reactions between hared and cr vi gu and chen 2003 at ph 7 the rate of cr vi reduction was slightly higher than at ph 6 fig 2a table s2 this deviation of the general trend of cr vi reduction versus ph was probably attributed to the higher reactivity of quinones available for cr vi reduction at ph 7 lian et al 2016 the presence of common cations na ca2 and mg2 enhanced the reduction of cr vi by ahared fig 2b d the extent and rate of cr vi reduction increased with increasing na concentration fig 2b ca2 and mg2 also promoted cr vi reduction but the greatest increases in the reduction rate occurred at lower concentrations i e 0 5 mm ca2 mg2 fig 2c and d divalent cations ca2 and mg2 could bind with the carboxyl groups of ha through complexation reactions that affect the ha surface charge and binding sites for other competing metal ions hering and morel 1988 wall and choppin 2003 liao et al 2019 zeta potential measurements showed that all three cations lowered the negative charge of ha but divalent ca2 and mg2 had much more pronounced effects for neutralizing ha s negative surface charge than monovalent na figs s3 and s4 sorption of anionic cr vi to ha is thus less electrostatically unfavorable and may contribute to the observed rates of cr vi reduction liao et al 2019 reported an inhibitory effect of ca2 and mg2 on the redox reactivity of ha and attributed it to the complexation and aggregation of ha by ca2 and mg2 that blocked the active site of ha and suppressed the electron transfer reactions the promotional effect of ca2 and mg2 on cr vi reduction by hared observed in this study suggested that the redox active groups e g quinone and sulfur containing sites may not be influenced by ca2 and mg2 and that the reduction of cr vi by the redox active groups was much faster than the aggregation of ha by ca2 and mg2 at concentrations 0 5 10 mm tested in this study 3 3 formation of nom cr iii colloids upon cr vi reduction cr vi reduction by hared is accompanied by colloidal cr iii formation even when cr vi concentration dropped to a very low concentration we still need to consider the particle stability of reduced cr iii because cr iii species could be reoxidized to toxic cr vi when they are exposed to oxidizing conditions landrot et al 2012 concentrations of cr iii observed in suspensions appeared to correlate with the rate of cr vi reduction figs s5 and s6 for all experiments the aqueous cr iii 220 nm and total cr iii concentrations rose rapidly within the first 30 min and then gradually approached a plateau figs s5 and s6 the ratio of aqueous cr iii to total cr iii was observed to be 0 87 for all ha concentration conditions suggesting that aqueous cr iii dominated further size partitioning results clearly demonstrated that truly dissolved cr iii 1 3 nm was negligible after 10 kda membrane ultrafiltration and most of cr iii was present in colloidal form 10000 da 220 nm fig 3 a and b in contrast to cr iii the remaining cr vi after reduction was primarily present as truly dissolved form with cr vi concentrations in the filtered fraction 10000 da being quite high fig s7 colloidal cr iii constituted as much as 80 99 of the total cr iii fraction in the suspensions regardless of the concentration and origin of ha fig 3a and b this is similar to prior work of wu et al 2001 who reported that substantial portions 99 of the operationally defined dissolved metal e g fe iii were present in colloidal phase in marine environments formation of ha cr iii colloids is likely due to the complexation of cr iii with ha followed by polymerization of ha although cr iii has a low solubility at neutral ph e g 10 9 m sass and rai 1987 the measured colloidal cr iii concentrations in this study were much higher than the predicted solubility of cr oh 3 s which may be ascribed to the formation of ha cr iii complexes kaczynski and kieber 1994 fukushima et al 1995 complexation of cr iii by ha may inhibit extensive hydrolysis of cr iii to cr oh 3 and thus inhibit particle aggregation to favor smaller particle sizes kaczynski and kieber 1994 icopini and long 2002 dls results support this proposition showing that the hydrodynamic diameters of suspensions were in the range of 210 240 nm fig 3c and d and remained largely unchanged over 60 days zeta potential measurements provided further evidence for the colloidal stabilization of ha cr iii complexes the zeta potentials of suspensions for all ha concentration conditions show significant negative surface charges 41 2 49 1 mv fig 3c and d supporting the observed high dispersion of ha cr iii colloids due to strong electrostatic stabilization effect from free ha adsorbed on the surfaces of colloids liao et al 2017a pan et al 2017a this stabilization mechanism has also been observed for the formation of ha fe iii colloids liao et al 2017a ph had a marginal influence on the formation and colloidal stability of ha cr iii colloids fig 4 a and b an increase in ph from 6 to 10 did not significantly alter the size fractionation of cr iii and colloidal cr iii remained the dominant cr iii fraction fig 4a this is consistent with dls results fig 4b which showed that the hydrodynamic diameters of suspensions were comparable 217 261 nm at ph 6 10 this is because the formed ha cr iii colloids under these conditions were highly negatively charged 45 7 72 2 mv fig s2 resulting in strong electrostatic repulsive forces between particles and thus preventing their aggregation in contrast the zeta potential of the suspensions at ph 5 was 27 2 mv a value near the typical threshold of 30 mv via derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory elimelech et al 1995 and consequently aggregation of ha cr iii colloids to larger particles could occur readily this is confirmed by the relatively low colloidal cr iii concentration and larger hydrodynamic diameter of suspensions at ph 5 fig 4a and b divalent cations ca2 and mg2 affected the ha cr iii colloids formation in a concentration dependent manner fig 4e h at ca2 mg2 1 mm the ha cr iii suspensions were colloidal stable however a substantial decrease in colloidal cr iii concentration and increase in particle size were observed as the ca2 mg2 concentrations increased from 1 to 10 mm fig 4e h the aggregation and destabilization of ha cr iii colloids at higher ca2 and mg2 concentrations can be explained by electrostatic interactions through dlvo theory elimelech et al 1995 zeta potential results showed a dramatic drop in surface negative charge as a function of increasing ca2 and mg2 concentrations fig s4 for example at 10 mm ca2 mg2 the ha cr iii suspensions were only slightly negatively charged being 14 0 8 mv for ca2 and 16 8 2 4 mv for mg2 leading to very weak repulsive energy between particles and thus accelerating particle aggregation the extent of the decrease in colloidal cr iii concentrations due to aggregation was more pronounced for ca2 than for mg2 fig 4e h likely due to the stronger complexation and bridging effects of ca2 compared to mg2 philippe and schaumann 2014 in contrast to ca2 and mg2 the presence of na at concentrations between 1 and 100 mm had a minimal effect on the formation and aggregation of ha cr iii colloids fig 4c and d due to the high negative charge of the suspensions 35 mv fig s3 3 4 characterization of nom cr iii colloids high resolution cs stem provided nanoscale information on the morphology and microscopic structure of ha cr iii colloids formed at ph 6 fig 5 the high angle annular dark field haadf stem images showed that the colloidal particles for both aha cr and ppsha cr samples exhibited irregular morphology with average primary diameters between 5 and 50 nm fig 5a and b the fast fourier transform fft patterns the insets in fig 5a and b showed no obvious lattice fringes for both ha cr iii colloids indicative of poor crystallinity or amorphous materials haadf stem eds mappings showed similar elemental distribution of c and cr across the imaged regions fig 5 indicating the intimate association of ha with cr at the nanoscale as the electron intensity of haadf stem imaging is approximately proportional to the atomic number pennycook and nellist 2011 the brighter spots in haadf images must correspond to cr given that cr has a larger atomic number compared to c 24 versus 6 fig 5 eds mappings confirmed this proposition showing that c was either homogenously or heterogeneously enriched on the surface of electron dense areas that were likely composed of ha cr nanoparticles or cluster fig 5 further evidence in support of this conclusion is provided below xps spectroscopy was used to further characterize the chemical state and distribution of cr present on the particle near surface fig 6 a c spectra of cr iii as crcl3 solid and cr vi as k2cr2o7 solid were provided as references for comparison consistent with the findings of aqueous phase analysis as discussed above the cr 2p xps spectra of solids from reaction of cr vi with hared both ahared and ppshared at ph 6 revealed that cr vi was completely reduced to cr iii as there was no significant cr vi feature peak e g 579 6 ev fig 6a fitting the high resolution cr 2p 3 2 spectra further confirmed the domination of cr iii on the particle near surface fig 6a which is consistent with prior x ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy xanes measurements that showed that the solid products of cr vi reduction by ha material contained solely cr iii jiang et al 2014 because xps typically probes the topmost 1 10 nm of samples we then performed a xps depth profiling technique to probe the spatial distribution of cr as a function of probing depth from surface to 100 nm depth fig 6b and c results indicated that cr iii dominated at all depths tested and the intensity of cr iii increased with increasing probing depth for both aha cr and ppsha cr samples fig 6b and c suggesting the relative enrichment of ha on the surface of ha cr iii colloids this is consistent with the haadf stem eds results described above fig 5 the ha rich surface could explain the high colloidal stability of ha cr iii particles observed under our experimental conditions atr ftir spectroscopy provided molecular information on the binding of ha with reduced cr iii for colloidal ha cr iii complex formation fig 6d the spectra of samples from the reaction of hared with cr vi were much different from the initial unreacted hared the two broad peaks at 1596 and 1391 cm 1 in the unreacted hared suggest asymmetric and symmetric vibrations for coo groups sharma et al 2010 after completion of cr vi reduction the asymmetric coo peak at 1596 cm 1 shifted to a higher wavenumber of 1636 cm 1 and the intensity of this peak decreased for both aha cr and ppsha cr samples fig 6d such a large shift and decrease in the intensity of coo stretching band is likely attributed to the formation of carboxylate metal bonds through a ligand exchange mechanism sharma et al 2010 chen et al 2014 in addition the spectra for samples after reactions resulted in a significant decrease in the intensity of a symmetric coo peak at 1400 cm 1 fig 6d further suggesting that carboxyl groups were involved in the complexation of ha with reduced cr iii these observations are consistent with recent extended x ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy exafs results showing that cr iii formed stable polynuclear complexes with nom at ph 5 primarily through carboxyl functional groups gustafsson et al 2014 further the broad new peaks at 1205 and 1113 cm 1 after reactions may be attributed to the cr o c bridge vibrations or cr oh stretching vibration nakamoto 1978 the shape of the spectra for both aha cr and ppsha cr samples were similar but aha cr sample yielded a higher peak intensity at 1205 and 1113 cm 1 fig 6d 3 5 environmental implications redox transformation of nomox to nomred by microorganisms or geochemical reductants occurs ubiquitously in anoxic environments lovley et al 1996 gu et al 2011 liao et al 2017b and the interplays between nomred and cr vi are of particular importance for better understanding of cr speciation and mobility in subsurface environments this study extended our fundamental knowledge of the interaction of nom with cr vi from oxic conditions to anoxic conditions and provided clear evidence that nomred exerts an important control on the reduction of cr vi and stabilization of colloidal cr iii particles under anoxic conditions such complex cr cycles triggered by nomred are likely widespread in anoxic geochemical conditions and suggest that the fate and transport of cr may be more complicated than previously recognized as expected cr vi that is diffused from oxic zones across oxic anoxic transition interfaces into anoxic environments can be quickly reduced by nomred rates of cr vi reduction by nomred table s2 are considerably faster than those observed for microbial cr vi reduction pathways e g 3 81 8 95 10 3 min 1 in anoxic subsurface environments gu and chen 2003 liu et al 2002 although cr vi reduction by nom has been posited as a sink for cr wittbrodt and palmer 1995 jiang et al 2014 the reduced cr iii produced at lower ca2 and mg2 concentrations is resistant to precipitate due to the formation of stable nom cr iii colloids which are composed of small particles that stayed suspended in water for months such high colloidal stability highlights that colloid facilitated transport of cr iii particles may be a significant process governing the mobility of cr in subsurface given the dynamic redox nature of subsurface environments transport of nom cr iii colloids from anoxic environments across interfaces and into more oxygenated zones could enhance the probability of future reoxidation of cr iii to toxic highly mobile cr vi by oxidants such as manganese oxides and chloramine disinfectants landrot et al 2012 chebeir and liu 2016 pan et al 2017b liao et al 2020 thereby spreading contamination however nom cr iii colloids could be aggregated and destabilized by the presence of higher ca2 and mg2 concentrations thus promoting cr iii removal from the water column since organically complexed cr iii represents an important part of the biogeochemical cycle of cr puzon et al 2005 we proposed that colloid facilitated cr iii transport needs to be considered within the overall theoretical framework for reactive transport of cr under organic rich redox dynamic conditions further work is needed to extend our framework by deciphering the aggregation deposition transport and transformation of nom cr iii colloids in more realistic subsurface environments 4 conclusions this study to our knowledge is the first report elucidating hared mediated cr vi reduction mechanism and colloidal stability of reduced cr iii products under circumneutral anoxic conditions the most striking observation is that hared triggered rapid reduction of cr vi and formation of stable organic cr iii colloids over a wide range of anoxic conditions specifically the reduced quinone moieties present in hared can quickly transfer electrons to cr vi with cr vi reduction occurring on the time scale of minutes at neutral ph conditions 6 8 the presence of na 1 100 mm ca2 0 5 10 mm and mg2 0 5 10 mm enhanced cr vi reduction at ph 6 reduced cr iii can then complex with carboxyl groups of ha to form stable ha cr iii colloids that persisted in water for at least 2 months with negligible aggregation due to strong electrostatic interactions between particles however the presence of ca2 and mg2 at higher concentrations e g 10 mm promoted particle aggregation and thus suppressed ha cr iii colloid formation taken together our results provided new insights into the understanding of the fate and transport of cr in organic rich anoxic environments which is also
