7750,study region ten major river basins in china study focus the spatial and temporal distribution of terrestrial water storage tws in china is significantly affected by global climate change and increased human activity in this study we analyzed the spatial and temporal variability of tws in ten chinese basins based on data of the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace to discuss the driving force of tws we assessed the relative contributions and time lags of precipitation p evapotranspiration et and runoff r to tws using spearman correlation analysis and partial least squares regression pls new hydrological insights for the region results indicate that 1 tws generally shows a reduction trend at a rate of 1 58 0 067 mm a from 2003 to 2020 with the most significant decreasing trend in september 2 77 0 070 mm a 2 the relative contributions of p et and r to the tws in china are 29 89 6 98 31 03 6 92 and 39 09 10 82 respectively and are more prominent in low latitude regions than in high latitude regions 3 the best correlated lag times were 1 2 months between the p and tws responses 4 melting snow ice and groundwater extraction may have weakened the response of the northern tws to the climate the results provide insight into the spatial and temporal variation in water storage which can provide a basis for the scientific and effective management of water resources graphical abstract ga1 keywords grace terrestrial water storage relative contribution hydroclimatic variables data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction terrestrial water storage tws refers to all the water stored on land and consists mainly of soil water snow groundwater rivers lakes and canopy water storage getirana et al 2017 syed et al 2008a the tws has an essential effect on regional ecological social and economic systems especially in arid and semi arid regions long et al 2014 ramillien et al 2005 yeh and famiglietti 2008 as the world s most populous country china suffers from severe water scarcity therefore tws monitoring and driver analysis can provide scientific support for sustainable water resource management gravity changes observed by the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace mission have provided measurements of regional variations in the tws wahr et al 2004 numerous studies have shown that the tws monitored by the grace mission is consistent with hydrological model results d√∂ll et al 2014 felfelani et al 2017 han et al 2010 tapley et al 2004a 2004b this dataset has been widely used in water storage studies in africa e g ahmed et al 2014 amazonia e g crowley et al 2008 and china e g r l liu et al 2022 mo et al 2016 tws is dynamically balanced on a global scale however differences in regional water inflows and outflows over time cause water resources to vary beyond usual levels there is significant spatial heterogeneity in tws the tws in the northwestern part of the tibetan plateau shows a significant upward trend whereas a significant downward trend exists in the south deng et al 2018a the temporal variation and spatial distribution of tws are mainly influenced by climate change shiru et al 2021 sohoulande et al 2020 and human activities tang et al 2013a zhang et al 2021a for example increased tws may be due to increased precipitation or decreased evapotranspiration and runoff rodell et al 2004a many researchers have studied the relationship between regional tws variability and hydrological fluxes using the grace dataset soni and syed 2015 argued that precipitation and tws changes are consistent with a time lag of one to two months zhang et al 2019 noted a significant negative correlation between tws and evapotranspiration at high latitudes such as in the yenisei basin and the mississippi river basin in north america however he observed a weak positive correlation at low latitudes such as in the congo basin in addition to the climatological finding that evapotranspiration causes changes in surface water volume more groundwater overdrafts exacerbate evapotranspiration in basins that are more influenced by human activities such as the haihe river basin in china pan et al 2017 soni and syed 2015 found the highest correlation between runoff and tws anomalies after one month in the mahanadi godavari and ganges basins dettinger and diaz 2000 found that runoff under the influence of snowmelt led to the depletion of tws in the lena and yenisei basins hirschi et al 2006 obtained the same conclusion in north america s columbia yukon and mackenzie river basins syed et al 2008a used grace to analyze continental scale water storage and found that precipitation played a key role at low latitudes in the tropics whereas evapotranspiration varied in tws at mid latitudes at high latitudes snowpack and snowmelt driven runoff were significantly correlated with the tws scholars have focused their research on tws in china in areas sensitive to climate change qinghai tibet plateau deng et al 2018a northwest arid and semi arid regions xie et al 2018 and areas with significant anthropogenic impacts the north china plain with groundwater overdraft tang et al 2013a and the yellow river basin with agricultural irrigation chen et al 2021 these studies have focused little on the spatial differences among the ten major river basins in china in addition current studies tend to analyze the correlation of tws with each factor without considering the interaction and combined contribution of multiple factors our study aims to 1 detect the spatial and temporal changes in tws in ten major river basins in china for the period 2003 2020 2 investigate the relationship of precipitation p evapotranspiration et and runoff r change to tws and 3 assess the drivers of significant changes in tws 2 study area and data 2 1 study area china is a vast territory with a total land area of approximately 9 6 million square kilometers the topography of china is roughly stepped from east to west but covers a variety of terrains including plateaus hills mountains and basins the large latitudinal span of china has led to a complex and diverse climate the difference between the subtropical monsoon climate in southern china and the temperate monsoon climate in the north allows more precipitation in the south than in the north in addition there are larger rivers and higher vegetation cover in the south as a result the spatial distribution of water resources in china shows a decreasing trend from south to north with a vast difference water resources in the southeast coastal region of china account for up to 80 of the total water resources in addition owing to the monsoon climate the rainy season is concentrated in the summer and autumn at the same time the runoff also shows an apparent alternation of abundance and depletion resulting in uneven intra and interannual distribution of water resources we used the spatial division scheme for water resource basins from the ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china http www mwr gov cn based on this scheme china is divided into ten major river basins fig 1 the northern region of china is divided into the songhua river basin srb liaohe river basin lrb hai river basin hrb yellow river basin yrb and northwest basin nwb the southern region of china includes the southwest basin swb yangtze river basin yzrb huaihe river basin hhrb southeast basin seb and pearl river basin prb 2 2 terrestrial water storage the grace twin satellite system developed by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa and the german space agency was launched and started to work at the beginning of 2002 grace retired in october 2017 after 15 years of overdue operation its replacement grace fo was launched in may 2018 and is continuing grace s mission of measuring the distance between two satellites and the speed of change grace grace fo observations were initially provided to users primarily in the form of so called level 2 products in spherical harmonic sh coefficients to obtain the corresponding physical quantity the user needs to perform a series of tedious post processing steps on the sh such as filtering and correcting leakage errors scanlon et al 2016 in recent years the goddard space flight center gsfc center for space research csr and jet propulsion laboratory jpl have successively released a new generation of grace grace fo observation data products called mascon products loomis et al 2019 after parameterizing the gravity field using the area mass concentration function mascon can be used directly without post processing in addition the solutions clearly define land and sea areas to reduce leakage errors due to filtering the mascon products released by these three institutions have been widely used in hydrology oceanography geodynamics and other fields limited by satellite height the original resolution of grace grace fo is 300 km to better cover small basins the csr mascon provides 0 25 0 25 resampled tws anomaly products liu et al 2021 these products are expressed in units of equivalent water thickness mm because csr mascon requires little post processing and has the highest grid resolution we chose the csr mascon product save et al 2016 several studies have used this dataset for global and regional tws trend analyses sun et al 2018 xiong et al 2021a yang et al 2021 save et al 2016 provide more details about csr mascon solutions similar to cui et al 2022 and bai et al 2022 we extracted data from the reconstructed tws anomaly dataset supplied by the national qinghai tibet plateau science data center https data tpdc ac cn for the 164th to 174th months i e from july 2017 to may 2018 to fill the data gap between the grace and grace fo missions the 22 months of missing data due to power supply problems were filled using cubic spline interpolation 2 3 hydroclimatic data the global land data assimilation system gldas is the best land surface state and flux field generated by extracting satellite data and ground based observations using advanced data assimilation and land surface modeling techniques rodell et al 2004b the gldas noah model products include hydroclimatic data such as precipitation air temperature runoff evapotranspiration and soil water we selected the monthly evapotranspiration and runoff data products of gldas 2 1 noah with a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 https hydro1 gesdisc eosdis nasa gov data gldas the hydroclimatic transient variables were scaled on a monthly timescale the runoff calculation is the cumulative amount of monthly surface and baseflow groundwater runoff fewer weather stations make efficient spatial analysis more difficult in addition gldas data have relatively high temporal and spatial resolutions compared with other types of products which can meet the requirements of this experiment many studies have shown that gldas data have good applicability in china wang et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 syed et al 2008a proved that the tws simulated by gldas was consistent with the trend of the tws based on grace the monthly precipitation data are the average of three independent data estimates in addition to the precipitation data provided by gldas it includes the cru dataset developed by the university of east anglia https data ceda ac uk badc cru and the gpcc precipitation dataset https opendata dwd de climate environment gpcc these datasets were resampled to ensure consistency with the spatial resolution of the tws dataset in addition we deducted the mean values for the period january 2004 december 2009 as the monthly anomalies of p et and r 3 methodology 3 1 seasonal kendall test the purpose of trend analysis is to understand the changing laws of the tws over time the seasonal kendall test is a nonparametric trend test method that does not need to consider the normal distribution of data the tws and hydroclimatic variables have clear seasonal and cyclical variation patterns the seasonal kendall test is an effective tool for calculating the seasonal trend of the series proposed by hirsch based on mann kendall hirsch et al 1982 this avoids the effect of seasonality by calculating the test statistics for each month separately the summed test statistics for each month were used to perform the significance trend test by referring to a standard normal distribution table the seasonal kendall test is widely used to analyze climate variables and hydrological series forney 2022 z liu 2022 snelder et al 2021 in addition the degree of tws variation was measured using sen s slope estimation method sen 1968 3 2 spearman correlation and cross correlation analysis correlation analysis measures the degree of relationship between variables popular pearson correlation analysis is mainly used to assess the relationship between two variables that satisfy a normal distribution spearman correlation analysis can be used when two variables do not conform to a normal distribution or when the type of distribution of the variables is unknown hauke and kossowski 2011 it evaluates the correlation between two statistical variables using monotonic equations similar to the kendall test the spearman correlation analysis is a nonparametric statistic which was used to determine the effects of the hydroclimatic variables on tws there is a lagged relationship between the effects of p et and r on tws the cross correlation method based on time series has been used for several applications in time lag relationships huang et al 2019 jiang et al 2021 it determines the substantial connection between the series by calculating the correlation coefficients of the two series with different time differences because the hydroclimatic variables show a practical time lag to the effect of tws we discuss the positive time lag 0 6 months of the occurrence of the tws series lagging the hydroclimatic variables series if the absolute value of the maximum correlation coefficient between the tws and hydroclimatic variables occurs between month t and month t n the occurrence of the tws series is considered to lag the hydroclimatic variable series by n months 3 3 partial least squares regression the partial least squares pls regression proposed by wold et al 1984 has been widely used in law and medicine on the one hand pls dissects the information between variables to best explain the dependent variable on the other hand it removes the interference of systematic noise compared with the general multivariate regression model for determining significance pls analysis accepts the existence of multiple correlations among the explanatory variables it is not affected by the number of samples and can be applied to multivariate data analysis yin et al 2020 therefore the pls regression model was used to quantify the relative contributions of hydroclimatic factors to the tws in ten major river basins in china pls is a regression model that projects dependent and independent variables into a new space our analysis is based on the pls regression model with a single dependent variable tws suppose there are n sets of experiments with dependent variable y and independent variable xj for j 1 2 3 like the idea of principal component analysis pls extracts the principal components t of multiple independent variables x and y the regression of y and t is established by ensuring the maximum linear correlation between x and t pls treats t as a new set of variables for least squares regression compared with the principal component analysis it can be said that y plays a role in adjusting the parameters of each principal component the coefficient of determination r2 was used to assess the predictive accuracy of the regression model nagelkerke 1991 the formula used is as follows 1 r 2 1 i y i f i 2 i y i y 2 where y and f are the actual and predicted values respectively and y is the average of the actual values the variable importance in pls projections vip measures the explanatory effect of each independent variable on the dependent variable eriksson et al 2001 wold et al 2002 the higher the value of vip the higher the contribution of the independent variable empirically the vip values indicate the relative importance of the variables and the values of the insignificant moderately important and crucial variables range between 0 8 0 8 1 0 and 1 0 respectively johnson and wichern 2002 the contribution of the jth independent variable xj to y in vipj can be expressed as 2 vip j p m 1 m r 2 y t m w mj 2 m 1 m r 2 y t m 1 2 where p and m are the numbers of independent variables and principal components p 3 and m 3 r 2 y t m is the square of the correlation coefficient between the dependent variable y and the principal component tm and wmj is the covariance between j and m tran et al 2014 4 results 4 1 temporal variability of tws the time curve of tws in china is shown in fig 2 from 2003 2020 the regional average tws in china showed a significantly decreasing trend with a rate of 1 58 0 067 mm a the red dotted line represents the average tws series for all of china the tws fluctuated between 50 mm and 50 mm per month the tws reached a maximum of 43 98 mm in september 2003 and a minimum of 43 13 mm in may 2020 the seasonal variation in fig 2b shows that the interannual variation of tws in jja decreases the fastest at a rate of 2 12 0 067 mm a indicating that water storage decreases at the quickest rate in the summer the rate of reduction in tws for mam and son was 1 60 0 065 mm a and 1 40 0 072 mm a respectively while djf had a minor interannual variation of 0 71 0 066 mm a as shown in fig 2c the tws in china was generally in deficit in all months the two months with the highest losses were september and june with water resources decreasing at a rate of 2 77 0 070 and 2 10 0 065 mm a respectively the minimum decreasing trend of tws was below 1 00 mm a in january and february we analyzed the variation trends of the tws in ten basins in china fig 3 the four basins of yzrb prb seb and srb all showed a significantly increasing trend the basins with the largest and smallest tws growth rates were prb 4 85 0 045 mm a p 0 001 and srb 1 33 0 078 mm a p 0 01 respectively the other six watersheds showed significantly decreasing trends in tws over the last 18 years tws showed the fastest reduction in hrb 16 94 0 488 mm a p 0 001 the tws reduction rates of the swb hhrb lrb and yrb decreased sequentially the interannual variation of tws in nwb decreased the slowest at a speed of 1 39 0 097 mm a 4 2 spatial variability of tws the spatial pattern of the tws trend is shown in fig 4 the red area in the graph indicates that tws has tended to decrease over the past 18 years while the blue area indicates an upward trend in the annual tws similar to the above results the swb lrb hrb and hhr tws showed a decreasing trend the growth patterns of the tws for the srb yzrb seb and srb are shown in fig 4 however the tws trends differ widely in the southern and northern parts of the nwb while the northern part showed a significantly decreasing trend the southern part mainly showed an increasing trend similar patterns were observed in the eastern and southern yrb the spatial variation of tws for the four seasons of djf mam jja and son is shown in fig s1 from 2003 2020 all seasons showed similar trends in the ten major river basins the most remarkable differences in seasonal variation were found in the middle and lower reaches of the yzrb and the srb within the yzrb the tws showed an upward trend at a greater rate in son than in djf the tws growth rates were all less than 10 mm a in mam the same pattern exists in the srb basin where the rate of increase in mam and jja is lower than that of son and djf regions where tws is trending towards losses such as swb north of nwb and hrb have little difference in the loss rate over the four seasons 4 3 correlation analysis fig 5 shows the spatial distribution of correlation coefficients between tws and p et and r regions with significance below 0 05 were considered significantly correlated the statistical correlation results for the ten basins are shown in fig s2 tws was positively correlated with precipitation variation in the region between 20 n and 30 n the areas with significant positive and negative correlations accounted for 50 19 and 2 89 of china s area respectively as shown in fig 5b the effect of evapotranspiration changes on water storage in china remained almost consistent with that of precipitation the regions showing a significant positive correlation accounted for 52 50 of china s area and were mainly concentrated in the swb prb and seb china showed a significant negative correlation in 6 75 of the regions including the yrb hhrb hrb and nwb there was a positive correlation coefficient between runoff and tws in 64 68 of china except for the srb north of 45 n these positive correlation coefficients were mainly distributed in several basins south of 35 n the percentage of significantly negatively correlated areas was 6 44 concentrated between 35 n and 45 n overall it can be observed from fig 5 that the correlation between hydroclimatic variables and tws shows differences with 30 n as the dividing line p et and r were more vital for tws in areas south of the divide except for the strong correlation of srb the influence of hydroclimatic factors on tws was weaker in basins north of 30 n the coefficients of the hydroclimatic variables and tws in china were almost in the same direction most of the southern regions of china showed positive correlations whereas the opposite was true for the north considering that high correlations among the three hydroclimatic variables may have led to this result further analysis and discussion are needed 4 4 the relative contributions of hydroclimatic variables to tws the vip scores and r2 for p et and r for each basin based on pls analysis are shown in fig 6 fig 6a c shows the spatial distribution of the vip scores for p et and r fig s3 presents the statistical results for the percentages of insignificant moderately important and crucial variables the contribution of p to tws was weak in the srb and hhrb with less than 50 of the moderately scored areas p had the highest vip values in the swb and prb basins with greater than 0 8 accounting for 94 25 and 91 51 of the regions respectively et has poor explanatory power for the tws in the srb with 38 75 of the area having moderate explanatory power for the whole basin the contribution of et in the prb watershed is more remarkable with 86 84 of the regions having vip values greater than 0 8 but only 3 94 of the areas having vip values greater than 1 2 r contributed the most to the entire territory of china except for nwb the percentage of the place where runoff has a vip score above 0 8 is higher than 90 in all other basins overall r had the highest vip score in the chinese basin followed by evapotranspiration and the lowest precipitation as can be seen from fig 5d the higher values of r2 are concentrated in several low latitude basins such as the prb seb yzrb and swb while relatively lower values of r2 were found in high latitude basins such as the nwb and hrb the relative contribution was determined based on the percentage of the variable vip value to the total vip value the relative contributions of the hydroclimatic variables to china and each basin are shown in fig 7 for all regions in china the average relative contributions of p et and r to tws were 29 89 6 98 31 03 6 92 and 39 09 10 82 respectively the relative contribution of r was higher than that of et and p the maximum contribution of r was observed at the srb with 47 75 12 82 p and et were the highest in the seb and swb at 33 86 1 42 and 32 92 4 57 respectively runoff made a prominent contribution to the tws of the srb and hhrb the effects of the three variables on the variation in tws in the swb were almost equal the analysis of the relative contributions of hydroclimatic variables did not take into account the time lag effect between the variables the distribution of the coefficients of the variables is shown in fig s4 when the combined effect of the three variables was present precipitation had a predominantly positive contributing effect on tws as shown by the positive coefficients in most regions a negative number is prevalent in the majority of et and r coefficients with tws indicating that water storage decreases with an increase in evapotranspiration and runoff however we still observed positive regression coefficients for et and r at low latitudes in china such as the prb basin this phenomenon has also been reported in other studies frappart et al 2013 soni and syed 2015 zhang et al 2019 speculated that the possible cause was the indirect effect of human activities and other fluxes such as snowmelt 4 5 lagged spearman correlations the lag months with the maximum spearman coefficients are shown in fig 8 tws is most relevant to p after a delay of 1 2 months instantaneous correlations with no time lag between et and tws in most regions east of 110 e indicate that tws in these areas can respond quickly to changes in et the lag time in the region west of 110 e showed a stepwise distribution the et tws has a shorter lag time of two months in the swb and a longer lag time of five months in the yrb the lag times of r and tws showed a clear north south difference for the regions yzrb prb and lrb located south of 35 n tws is highest relevant to r after a delay of zero or one month the basins situated north of the dividing line had longer lag times fig 8d shows the percentage of lags for the different months there are 64 73 of regions in china that have a time lag of 1 3 months for p tws including 29 65 with a one month lag the percentages of regions with no time lag for et and r were 27 40 and 31 66 respectively the total area share of the 1 3 months lags in et was 46 10 the 0 1 month lags of runoff were the most common in china with an area share of 57 55 5 discussion 5 1 the influence of hydroclimatic variables on tws we comprehensively investigated the tws trend in china from january 2003 to december 2020 and its relationship with p et and r our findings are consistent with those of previous studies on global and regional scales lv et al 2021 xie et al 2018 zhao et al 2015 the tws shows a significantly rising tendency in the yzrb prb seb and srb and that of the other six basins decreased at different rates with the fastest decrease in the hrb 16 94 0 488 mm a we observed higher correlations concentrated in the basins of southern china implying that the tws is more sensitive to hydroclimatic variables at low latitudes than at high latitudes p et and r influence each other while driving changes in tws for example 83 of global surface r is sensitive to changes in p berghuijs et al 2017 a global analysis by syed et al 2008b also found a positive correlation between et and r at low and middle latitudes an increase in irrigation leads to an increase in evapotranspiration and a decrease in water storage pan et al 2017 the pls results generally showed positive coefficients for p and negative coefficients for et and r after excluding inter flux interactions when fitting the tws the determination of the relative contributions of r et and p showed that their relative contributions to tws in china were 39 09 10 82 31 03 6 92 and 29 89 6 98 respectively while runoff moderately explained vip 0 8 the variation in tws in 88 78 of the area in china the runoff in nwb basin weakly explained the same the regions where precipitation and evapotranspiration were moderately influential for the variation in tws accounted for 71 53 and 70 43 of the total area of china respectively precipitation eventually forms terrestrial water resources after complex hydrological processes such as evapotranspiration runoff and infiltration so there is a time lag of varying degrees eagleson 1978 ndehedehe et al 2016 xu et al 2018 the lag time is shorter 1 2 months in low latitude basins and longer in high latitude basins he et al 2019 this explains to some extent the low contribution of precipitation to tws we also found that the main contribution of hydroclimatic variables was concentrated in the region south of 30 n on the one hand these regions have abundant precipitation and are more sensitive to climate change on the other hand more human activities such as irrigation of crops construction of reservoirs and groundwater overdrafts affect the tws in the high northern latitudes due to chronic water scarcity in addition the melting of glaciers due to global warming is a factor that cannot be ignored 5 2 drivers for tws in ten basins the seb prb yzrb and swb are all located in a subtropical monsoon climate zone at low latitudes abundant rainfall in summer and autumn is the main reason for the significant increase in the tws in these basins huang et al 2021 sun et al 2018 due to glacial melting in the himalayas guo et al 2016 singh and bengtsson 2004 tws in swb decreases at a rate of 8 26 0 332 mm a from 2003 to 2020 we observed almost the same trend in the tws variation in the hrb hhrb and yrb the rate of decline of the tws slows from the center of the hrb to the surrounding areas fig 3 because of similar climatic and environmental conditions the three basins are located in the north china plain the most densely populated area in china and therefore have similar climatic and environmental conditions less precipitation and greater water supply demand have led to groundwater over extraction problems scanlon et al 2012 resulting in the world s largest leakage zone feng et al 2013 foster et al 2004 tang et al 2013b we observed a slowdown in the declining trend in tws in 2015 and 2016 this can be partly attributed to the treatment of the groundwater overdraft and the south north water transfer project in 2014 zhang et al 2021b although the lrb and srb are located in northeastern china different trends are observed for the tws the rate of increase of tws from the north to the south of the srb decreases owing to the combined effects of hydroelectric stations and global warming chen et al 2019 the lrb is an essential base for food production and heavy industry in china as a result approximately 54 of its water use comes from groundwater yin et al 2021 crude groundwater extraction has led to a significant decline in the lrb over the past 18 years the nwb had the lowest tws decline rate with the greatest extent global warming has accelerated the melting of tian shan glaciers in the nwb kriegel et al 2013 niederer et al 2008 the trend of the tws variation showed a clear north south difference and these results were similar to those of previous studies yang et al 2018 chen et al 2016 noted a shrinkage rate of 8 1 in tien shan from 2000 to 2012 this may be the reason for the significant decline in tws in the northern nwb most of the tws growth area is in the southern part of the northwestern region which belongs to the endorheic zone of the tibetan plateau glaciers and snowmelt at the site did not flow to other areas resulting in increased lake and groundwater storage deng et al 2018b zhang et al 2013 attributed 61 of the increase in tws in the region to lake expansion 5 3 uncertainties and limitations this study is critical for understanding the hydrological drivers of tws however uncertainties remain first the low resolution of the tws of grace is sufficient to reflect the fluctuation and intensity of water storage however it does not provide the actual status of the tws xiong et al 2021b second p et and r contributed less to the tws in the high latitude basins the impacts of snowmelt water diversion for irrigation and reservoir transfer on tws are highlighted in this regard third this study briefly analyzes the time lag of hydrological fluxes for 0 6 months the specific contribution of the time lag period was not conclusively established these issues will be addressed in future studies 6 conclusion this study analyzed the spatial and temporal variability and hydrological drivers of tws in ten major river basins in china from january 2003 to december 2020 the yzrb prb seb and srb show a decreasing trend in tws while the other basins show an increasing trend seasonal and monthly analyses revealed differences in the variability of tws tws declined three as fast in jja 2 12 0 067 mm a than it did in djf 0 71 0 066 mm a we analyzed the influence of hydroclimatic variables on tws in different basins the relative contribution of r was more significant than that of et and p without considering the time lag the tws lags significantly behind p by 1 2 months in most regions p reaching the ground to generate r for groundwater recharge is the main factor in the rise of tws in the southern basin p et and r have poor explanatory power for variations in tws in the northern basin through extensive comparisons with previous studies in different basins we suggest that the declining trend of tws in the hhrb hrb yrb and lrb is related to groundwater overexploitation glacial meltwater and snowmelt in the nwb and swb have opposite driving effects on the tws due to topography extensive comparisons verified the accuracy and reliability of the results

7750,study region ten major river basins in china study focus the spatial and temporal distribution of terrestrial water storage tws in china is significantly affected by global climate change and increased human activity in this study we analyzed the spatial and temporal variability of tws in ten chinese basins based on data of the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace to discuss the driving force of tws we assessed the relative contributions and time lags of precipitation p evapotranspiration et and runoff r to tws using spearman correlation analysis and partial least squares regression pls new hydrological insights for the region results indicate that 1 tws generally shows a reduction trend at a rate of 1 58 0 067 mm a from 2003 to 2020 with the most significant decreasing trend in september 2 77 0 070 mm a 2 the relative contributions of p et and r to the tws in china are 29 89 6 98 31 03 6 92 and 39 09 10 82 respectively and are more prominent in low latitude regions than in high latitude regions 3 the best correlated lag times were 1 2 months between the p and tws responses 4 melting snow ice and groundwater extraction may have weakened the response of the northern tws to the climate the results provide insight into the spatial and temporal variation in water storage which can provide a basis for the scientific and effective management of water resources graphical abstract ga1 keywords grace terrestrial water storage relative contribution hydroclimatic variables data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction terrestrial water storage tws refers to all the water stored on land and consists mainly of soil water snow groundwater rivers lakes and canopy water storage getirana et al 2017 syed et al 2008a the tws has an essential effect on regional ecological social and economic systems especially in arid and semi arid regions long et al 2014 ramillien et al 2005 yeh and famiglietti 2008 as the world s most populous country china suffers from severe water scarcity therefore tws monitoring and driver analysis can provide scientific support for sustainable water resource management gravity changes observed by the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace mission have provided measurements of regional variations in the tws wahr et al 2004 numerous studies have shown that the tws monitored by the grace mission is consistent with hydrological model results d√∂ll et al 2014 felfelani et al 2017 han et al 2010 tapley et al 2004a 2004b this dataset has been widely used in water storage studies in africa e g ahmed et al 2014 amazonia e g crowley et al 2008 and china e g r l liu et al 2022 mo et al 2016 tws is dynamically balanced on a global scale however differences in regional water inflows and outflows over time cause water resources to vary beyond usual levels there is significant spatial heterogeneity in tws the tws in the northwestern part of the tibetan plateau shows a significant upward trend whereas a significant downward trend exists in the south deng et al 2018a the temporal variation and spatial distribution of tws are mainly influenced by climate change shiru et al 2021 sohoulande et al 2020 and human activities tang et al 2013a zhang et al 2021a for example increased tws may be due to increased precipitation or decreased evapotranspiration and runoff rodell et al 2004a many researchers have studied the relationship between regional tws variability and hydrological fluxes using the grace dataset soni and syed 2015 argued that precipitation and tws changes are consistent with a time lag of one to two months zhang et al 2019 noted a significant negative correlation between tws and evapotranspiration at high latitudes such as in the yenisei basin and the mississippi river basin in north america however he observed a weak positive correlation at low latitudes such as in the congo basin in addition to the climatological finding that evapotranspiration causes changes in surface water volume more groundwater overdrafts exacerbate evapotranspiration in basins that are more influenced by human activities such as the haihe river basin in china pan et al 2017 soni and syed 2015 found the highest correlation between runoff and tws anomalies after one month in the mahanadi godavari and ganges basins dettinger and diaz 2000 found that runoff under the influence of snowmelt led to the depletion of tws in the lena and yenisei basins hirschi et al 2006 obtained the same conclusion in north america s columbia yukon and mackenzie river basins syed et al 2008a used grace to analyze continental scale water storage and found that precipitation played a key role at low latitudes in the tropics whereas evapotranspiration varied in tws at mid latitudes at high latitudes snowpack and snowmelt driven runoff were significantly correlated with the tws scholars have focused their research on tws in china in areas sensitive to climate change qinghai tibet plateau deng et al 2018a northwest arid and semi arid regions xie et al 2018 and areas with significant anthropogenic impacts the north china plain with groundwater overdraft tang et al 2013a and the yellow river basin with agricultural irrigation chen et al 2021 these studies have focused little on the spatial differences among the ten major river basins in china in addition current studies tend to analyze the correlation of tws with each factor without considering the interaction and combined contribution of multiple factors our study aims to 1 detect the spatial and temporal changes in tws in ten major river basins in china for the period 2003 2020 2 investigate the relationship of precipitation p evapotranspiration et and runoff r change to tws and 3 assess the drivers of significant changes in tws 2 study area and data 2 1 study area china is a vast territory with a total land area of approximately 9 6 million square kilometers the topography of china is roughly stepped from east to west but covers a variety of terrains including plateaus hills mountains and basins the large latitudinal span of china has led to a complex and diverse climate the difference between the subtropical monsoon climate in southern china and the temperate monsoon climate in the north allows more precipitation in the south than in the north in addition there are larger rivers and higher vegetation cover in the south as a result the spatial distribution of water resources in china shows a decreasing trend from south to north with a vast difference water resources in the southeast coastal region of china account for up to 80 of the total water resources in addition owing to the monsoon climate the rainy season is concentrated in the summer and autumn at the same time the runoff also shows an apparent alternation of abundance and depletion resulting in uneven intra and interannual distribution of water resources we used the spatial division scheme for water resource basins from the ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china http www mwr gov cn based on this scheme china is divided into ten major river basins fig 1 the northern region of china is divided into the songhua river basin srb liaohe river basin lrb hai river basin hrb yellow river basin yrb and northwest basin nwb the southern region of china includes the southwest basin swb yangtze river basin yzrb huaihe river basin hhrb southeast basin seb and pearl river basin prb 2 2 terrestrial water storage the grace twin satellite system developed by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa and the german space agency was launched and started to work at the beginning of 2002 grace retired in october 2017 after 15 years of overdue operation its replacement grace fo was launched in may 2018 and is continuing grace s mission of measuring the distance between two satellites and the speed of change grace grace fo observations were initially provided to users primarily in the form of so called level 2 products in spherical harmonic sh coefficients to obtain the corresponding physical quantity the user needs to perform a series of tedious post processing steps on the sh such as filtering and correcting leakage errors scanlon et al 2016 in recent years the goddard space flight center gsfc center for space research csr and jet propulsion laboratory jpl have successively released a new generation of grace grace fo observation data products called mascon products loomis et al 2019 after parameterizing the gravity field using the area mass concentration function mascon can be used directly without post processing in addition the solutions clearly define land and sea areas to reduce leakage errors due to filtering the mascon products released by these three institutions have been widely used in hydrology oceanography geodynamics and other fields limited by satellite height the original resolution of grace grace fo is 300 km to better cover small basins the csr mascon provides 0 25 0 25 resampled tws anomaly products liu et al 2021 these products are expressed in units of equivalent water thickness mm because csr mascon requires little post processing and has the highest grid resolution we chose the csr mascon product save et al 2016 several studies have used this dataset for global and regional tws trend analyses sun et al 2018 xiong et al 2021a yang et al 2021 save et al 2016 provide more details about csr mascon solutions similar to cui et al 2022 and bai et al 2022 we extracted data from the reconstructed tws anomaly dataset supplied by the national qinghai tibet plateau science data center https data tpdc ac cn for the 164th to 174th months i e from july 2017 to may 2018 to fill the data gap between the grace and grace fo missions the 22 months of missing data due to power supply problems were filled using cubic spline interpolation 2 3 hydroclimatic data the global land data assimilation system gldas is the best land surface state and flux field generated by extracting satellite data and ground based observations using advanced data assimilation and land surface modeling techniques rodell et al 2004b the gldas noah model products include hydroclimatic data such as precipitation air temperature runoff evapotranspiration and soil water we selected the monthly evapotranspiration and runoff data products of gldas 2 1 noah with a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 https hydro1 gesdisc eosdis nasa gov data gldas the hydroclimatic transient variables were scaled on a monthly timescale the runoff calculation is the cumulative amount of monthly surface and baseflow groundwater runoff fewer weather stations make efficient spatial analysis more difficult in addition gldas data have relatively high temporal and spatial resolutions compared with other types of products which can meet the requirements of this experiment many studies have shown that gldas data have good applicability in china wang et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 syed et al 2008a proved that the tws simulated by gldas was consistent with the trend of the tws based on grace the monthly precipitation data are the average of three independent data estimates in addition to the precipitation data provided by gldas it includes the cru dataset developed by the university of east anglia https data ceda ac uk badc cru and the gpcc precipitation dataset https opendata dwd de climate environment gpcc these datasets were resampled to ensure consistency with the spatial resolution of the tws dataset in addition we deducted the mean values for the period january 2004 december 2009 as the monthly anomalies of p et and r 3 methodology 3 1 seasonal kendall test the purpose of trend analysis is to understand the changing laws of the tws over time the seasonal kendall test is a nonparametric trend test method that does not need to consider the normal distribution of data the tws and hydroclimatic variables have clear seasonal and cyclical variation patterns the seasonal kendall test is an effective tool for calculating the seasonal trend of the series proposed by hirsch based on mann kendall hirsch et al 1982 this avoids the effect of seasonality by calculating the test statistics for each month separately the summed test statistics for each month were used to perform the significance trend test by referring to a standard normal distribution table the seasonal kendall test is widely used to analyze climate variables and hydrological series forney 2022 z liu 2022 snelder et al 2021 in addition the degree of tws variation was measured using sen s slope estimation method sen 1968 3 2 spearman correlation and cross correlation analysis correlation analysis measures the degree of relationship between variables popular pearson correlation analysis is mainly used to assess the relationship between two variables that satisfy a normal distribution spearman correlation analysis can be used when two variables do not conform to a normal distribution or when the type of distribution of the variables is unknown hauke and kossowski 2011 it evaluates the correlation between two statistical variables using monotonic equations similar to the kendall test the spearman correlation analysis is a nonparametric statistic which was used to determine the effects of the hydroclimatic variables on tws there is a lagged relationship between the effects of p et and r on tws the cross correlation method based on time series has been used for several applications in time lag relationships huang et al 2019 jiang et al 2021 it determines the substantial connection between the series by calculating the correlation coefficients of the two series with different time differences because the hydroclimatic variables show a practical time lag to the effect of tws we discuss the positive time lag 0 6 months of the occurrence of the tws series lagging the hydroclimatic variables series if the absolute value of the maximum correlation coefficient between the tws and hydroclimatic variables occurs between month t and month t n the occurrence of the tws series is considered to lag the hydroclimatic variable series by n months 3 3 partial least squares regression the partial least squares pls regression proposed by wold et al 1984 has been widely used in law and medicine on the one hand pls dissects the information between variables to best explain the dependent variable on the other hand it removes the interference of systematic noise compared with the general multivariate regression model for determining significance pls analysis accepts the existence of multiple correlations among the explanatory variables it is not affected by the number of samples and can be applied to multivariate data analysis yin et al 2020 therefore the pls regression model was used to quantify the relative contributions of hydroclimatic factors to the tws in ten major river basins in china pls is a regression model that projects dependent and independent variables into a new space our analysis is based on the pls regression model with a single dependent variable tws suppose there are n sets of experiments with dependent variable y and independent variable xj for j 1 2 3 like the idea of principal component analysis pls extracts the principal components t of multiple independent variables x and y the regression of y and t is established by ensuring the maximum linear correlation between x and t pls treats t as a new set of variables for least squares regression compared with the principal component analysis it can be said that y plays a role in adjusting the parameters of each principal component the coefficient of determination r2 was used to assess the predictive accuracy of the regression model nagelkerke 1991 the formula used is as follows 1 r 2 1 i y i f i 2 i y i y 2 where y and f are the actual and predicted values respectively and y is the average of the actual values the variable importance in pls projections vip measures the explanatory effect of each independent variable on the dependent variable eriksson et al 2001 wold et al 2002 the higher the value of vip the higher the contribution of the independent variable empirically the vip values indicate the relative importance of the variables and the values of the insignificant moderately important and crucial variables range between 0 8 0 8 1 0 and 1 0 respectively johnson and wichern 2002 the contribution of the jth independent variable xj to y in vipj can be expressed as 2 vip j p m 1 m r 2 y t m w mj 2 m 1 m r 2 y t m 1 2 where p and m are the numbers of independent variables and principal components p 3 and m 3 r 2 y t m is the square of the correlation coefficient between the dependent variable y and the principal component tm and wmj is the covariance between j and m tran et al 2014 4 results 4 1 temporal variability of tws the time curve of tws in china is shown in fig 2 from 2003 2020 the regional average tws in china showed a significantly decreasing trend with a rate of 1 58 0 067 mm a the red dotted line represents the average tws series for all of china the tws fluctuated between 50 mm and 50 mm per month the tws reached a maximum of 43 98 mm in september 2003 and a minimum of 43 13 mm in may 2020 the seasonal variation in fig 2b shows that the interannual variation of tws in jja decreases the fastest at a rate of 2 12 0 067 mm a indicating that water storage decreases at the quickest rate in the summer the rate of reduction in tws for mam and son was 1 60 0 065 mm a and 1 40 0 072 mm a respectively while djf had a minor interannual variation of 0 71 0 066 mm a as shown in fig 2c the tws in china was generally in deficit in all months the two months with the highest losses were september and june with water resources decreasing at a rate of 2 77 0 070 and 2 10 0 065 mm a respectively the minimum decreasing trend of tws was below 1 00 mm a in january and february we analyzed the variation trends of the tws in ten basins in china fig 3 the four basins of yzrb prb seb and srb all showed a significantly increasing trend the basins with the largest and smallest tws growth rates were prb 4 85 0 045 mm a p 0 001 and srb 1 33 0 078 mm a p 0 01 respectively the other six watersheds showed significantly decreasing trends in tws over the last 18 years tws showed the fastest reduction in hrb 16 94 0 488 mm a p 0 001 the tws reduction rates of the swb hhrb lrb and yrb decreased sequentially the interannual variation of tws in nwb decreased the slowest at a speed of 1 39 0 097 mm a 4 2 spatial variability of tws the spatial pattern of the tws trend is shown in fig 4 the red area in the graph indicates that tws has tended to decrease over the past 18 years while the blue area indicates an upward trend in the annual tws similar to the above results the swb lrb hrb and hhr tws showed a decreasing trend the growth patterns of the tws for the srb yzrb seb and srb are shown in fig 4 however the tws trends differ widely in the southern and northern parts of the nwb while the northern part showed a significantly decreasing trend the southern part mainly showed an increasing trend similar patterns were observed in the eastern and southern yrb the spatial variation of tws for the four seasons of djf mam jja and son is shown in fig s1 from 2003 2020 all seasons showed similar trends in the ten major river basins the most remarkable differences in seasonal variation were found in the middle and lower reaches of the yzrb and the srb within the yzrb the tws showed an upward trend at a greater rate in son than in djf the tws growth rates were all less than 10 mm a in mam the same pattern exists in the srb basin where the rate of increase in mam and jja is lower than that of son and djf regions where tws is trending towards losses such as swb north of nwb and hrb have little difference in the loss rate over the four seasons 4 3 correlation analysis fig 5 shows the spatial distribution of correlation coefficients between tws and p et and r regions with significance below 0 05 were considered significantly correlated the statistical correlation results for the ten basins are shown in fig s2 tws was positively correlated with precipitation variation in the region between 20 n and 30 n the areas with significant positive and negative correlations accounted for 50 19 and 2 89 of china s area respectively as shown in fig 5b the effect of evapotranspiration changes on water storage in china remained almost consistent with that of precipitation the regions showing a significant positive correlation accounted for 52 50 of china s area and were mainly concentrated in the swb prb and seb china showed a significant negative correlation in 6 75 of the regions including the yrb hhrb hrb and nwb there was a positive correlation coefficient between runoff and tws in 64 68 of china except for the srb north of 45 n these positive correlation coefficients were mainly distributed in several basins south of 35 n the percentage of significantly negatively correlated areas was 6 44 concentrated between 35 n and 45 n overall it can be observed from fig 5 that the correlation between hydroclimatic variables and tws shows differences with 30 n as the dividing line p et and r were more vital for tws in areas south of the divide except for the strong correlation of srb the influence of hydroclimatic factors on tws was weaker in basins north of 30 n the coefficients of the hydroclimatic variables and tws in china were almost in the same direction most of the southern regions of china showed positive correlations whereas the opposite was true for the north considering that high correlations among the three hydroclimatic variables may have led to this result further analysis and discussion are needed 4 4 the relative contributions of hydroclimatic variables to tws the vip scores and r2 for p et and r for each basin based on pls analysis are shown in fig 6 fig 6a c shows the spatial distribution of the vip scores for p et and r fig s3 presents the statistical results for the percentages of insignificant moderately important and crucial variables the contribution of p to tws was weak in the srb and hhrb with less than 50 of the moderately scored areas p had the highest vip values in the swb and prb basins with greater than 0 8 accounting for 94 25 and 91 51 of the regions respectively et has poor explanatory power for the tws in the srb with 38 75 of the area having moderate explanatory power for the whole basin the contribution of et in the prb watershed is more remarkable with 86 84 of the regions having vip values greater than 0 8 but only 3 94 of the areas having vip values greater than 1 2 r contributed the most to the entire territory of china except for nwb the percentage of the place where runoff has a vip score above 0 8 is higher than 90 in all other basins overall r had the highest vip score in the chinese basin followed by evapotranspiration and the lowest precipitation as can be seen from fig 5d the higher values of r2 are concentrated in several low latitude basins such as the prb seb yzrb and swb while relatively lower values of r2 were found in high latitude basins such as the nwb and hrb the relative contribution was determined based on the percentage of the variable vip value to the total vip value the relative contributions of the hydroclimatic variables to china and each basin are shown in fig 7 for all regions in china the average relative contributions of p et and r to tws were 29 89 6 98 31 03 6 92 and 39 09 10 82 respectively the relative contribution of r was higher than that of et and p the maximum contribution of r was observed at the srb with 47 75 12 82 p and et were the highest in the seb and swb at 33 86 1 42 and 32 92 4 57 respectively runoff made a prominent contribution to the tws of the srb and hhrb the effects of the three variables on the variation in tws in the swb were almost equal the analysis of the relative contributions of hydroclimatic variables did not take into account the time lag effect between the variables the distribution of the coefficients of the variables is shown in fig s4 when the combined effect of the three variables was present precipitation had a predominantly positive contributing effect on tws as shown by the positive coefficients in most regions a negative number is prevalent in the majority of et and r coefficients with tws indicating that water storage decreases with an increase in evapotranspiration and runoff however we still observed positive regression coefficients for et and r at low latitudes in china such as the prb basin this phenomenon has also been reported in other studies frappart et al 2013 soni and syed 2015 zhang et al 2019 speculated that the possible cause was the indirect effect of human activities and other fluxes such as snowmelt 4 5 lagged spearman correlations the lag months with the maximum spearman coefficients are shown in fig 8 tws is most relevant to p after a delay of 1 2 months instantaneous correlations with no time lag between et and tws in most regions east of 110 e indicate that tws in these areas can respond quickly to changes in et the lag time in the region west of 110 e showed a stepwise distribution the et tws has a shorter lag time of two months in the swb and a longer lag time of five months in the yrb the lag times of r and tws showed a clear north south difference for the regions yzrb prb and lrb located south of 35 n tws is highest relevant to r after a delay of zero or one month the basins situated north of the dividing line had longer lag times fig 8d shows the percentage of lags for the different months there are 64 73 of regions in china that have a time lag of 1 3 months for p tws including 29 65 with a one month lag the percentages of regions with no time lag for et and r were 27 40 and 31 66 respectively the total area share of the 1 3 months lags in et was 46 10 the 0 1 month lags of runoff were the most common in china with an area share of 57 55 5 discussion 5 1 the influence of hydroclimatic variables on tws we comprehensively investigated the tws trend in china from january 2003 to december 2020 and its relationship with p et and r our findings are consistent with those of previous studies on global and regional scales lv et al 2021 xie et al 2018 zhao et al 2015 the tws shows a significantly rising tendency in the yzrb prb seb and srb and that of the other six basins decreased at different rates with the fastest decrease in the hrb 16 94 0 488 mm a we observed higher correlations concentrated in the basins of southern china implying that the tws is more sensitive to hydroclimatic variables at low latitudes than at high latitudes p et and r influence each other while driving changes in tws for example 83 of global surface r is sensitive to changes in p berghuijs et al 2017 a global analysis by syed et al 2008b also found a positive correlation between et and r at low and middle latitudes an increase in irrigation leads to an increase in evapotranspiration and a decrease in water storage pan et al 2017 the pls results generally showed positive coefficients for p and negative coefficients for et and r after excluding inter flux interactions when fitting the tws the determination of the relative contributions of r et and p showed that their relative contributions to tws in china were 39 09 10 82 31 03 6 92 and 29 89 6 98 respectively while runoff moderately explained vip 0 8 the variation in tws in 88 78 of the area in china the runoff in nwb basin weakly explained the same the regions where precipitation and evapotranspiration were moderately influential for the variation in tws accounted for 71 53 and 70 43 of the total area of china respectively precipitation eventually forms terrestrial water resources after complex hydrological processes such as evapotranspiration runoff and infiltration so there is a time lag of varying degrees eagleson 1978 ndehedehe et al 2016 xu et al 2018 the lag time is shorter 1 2 months in low latitude basins and longer in high latitude basins he et al 2019 this explains to some extent the low contribution of precipitation to tws we also found that the main contribution of hydroclimatic variables was concentrated in the region south of 30 n on the one hand these regions have abundant precipitation and are more sensitive to climate change on the other hand more human activities such as irrigation of crops construction of reservoirs and groundwater overdrafts affect the tws in the high northern latitudes due to chronic water scarcity in addition the melting of glaciers due to global warming is a factor that cannot be ignored 5 2 drivers for tws in ten basins the seb prb yzrb and swb are all located in a subtropical monsoon climate zone at low latitudes abundant rainfall in summer and autumn is the main reason for the significant increase in the tws in these basins huang et al 2021 sun et al 2018 due to glacial melting in the himalayas guo et al 2016 singh and bengtsson 2004 tws in swb decreases at a rate of 8 26 0 332 mm a from 2003 to 2020 we observed almost the same trend in the tws variation in the hrb hhrb and yrb the rate of decline of the tws slows from the center of the hrb to the surrounding areas fig 3 because of similar climatic and environmental conditions the three basins are located in the north china plain the most densely populated area in china and therefore have similar climatic and environmental conditions less precipitation and greater water supply demand have led to groundwater over extraction problems scanlon et al 2012 resulting in the world s largest leakage zone feng et al 2013 foster et al 2004 tang et al 2013b we observed a slowdown in the declining trend in tws in 2015 and 2016 this can be partly attributed to the treatment of the groundwater overdraft and the south north water transfer project in 2014 zhang et al 2021b although the lrb and srb are located in northeastern china different trends are observed for the tws the rate of increase of tws from the north to the south of the srb decreases owing to the combined effects of hydroelectric stations and global warming chen et al 2019 the lrb is an essential base for food production and heavy industry in china as a result approximately 54 of its water use comes from groundwater yin et al 2021 crude groundwater extraction has led to a significant decline in the lrb over the past 18 years the nwb had the lowest tws decline rate with the greatest extent global warming has accelerated the melting of tian shan glaciers in the nwb kriegel et al 2013 niederer et al 2008 the trend of the tws variation showed a clear north south difference and these results were similar to those of previous studies yang et al 2018 chen et al 2016 noted a shrinkage rate of 8 1 in tien shan from 2000 to 2012 this may be the reason for the significant decline in tws in the northern nwb most of the tws growth area is in the southern part of the northwestern region which belongs to the endorheic zone of the tibetan plateau glaciers and snowmelt at the site did not flow to other areas resulting in increased lake and groundwater storage deng et al 2018b zhang et al 2013 attributed 61 of the increase in tws in the region to lake expansion 5 3 uncertainties and limitations this study is critical for understanding the hydrological drivers of tws however uncertainties remain first the low resolution of the tws of grace is sufficient to reflect the fluctuation and intensity of water storage however it does not provide the actual status of the tws xiong et al 2021b second p et and r contributed less to the tws in the high latitude basins the impacts of snowmelt water diversion for irrigation and reservoir transfer on tws are highlighted in this regard third this study briefly analyzes the time lag of hydrological fluxes for 0 6 months the specific contribution of the time lag period was not conclusively established these issues will be addressed in future studies 6 conclusion this study analyzed the spatial and temporal variability and hydrological drivers of tws in ten major river basins in china from january 2003 to december 2020 the yzrb prb seb and srb show a decreasing trend in tws while the other basins show an increasing trend seasonal and monthly analyses revealed differences in the variability of tws tws declined three as fast in jja 2 12 0 067 mm a than it did in djf 0 71 0 066 mm a we analyzed the influence of hydroclimatic variables on tws in different basins the relative contribution of r was more significant than that of et and p without considering the time lag the tws lags significantly behind p by 1 2 months in most regions p reaching the ground to generate r for groundwater recharge is the main factor in the rise of tws in the southern basin p et and r have poor explanatory power for variations in tws in the northern basin through extensive comparisons with previous studies in different basins we suggest that the declining trend of tws in the hhrb hrb yrb and lrb is related to groundwater overexploitation glacial meltwater and snowmelt in the nwb and swb have opposite driving effects on the tws due to topography extensive comparisons verified the accuracy and reliability of the results

numbers silt land areas and connection modes according to the model results the protective measures of fully filled check dams and recommendations for promoting the construction of check dams were proposed in the study new hydrological insights for the region caesar lisflood model in the study obtained higher accuracy with both the nash sutcliff coefficient of efficiency and the coefficient of determination greater than 0 8 our results showed the presence of fully filled check dams made the flood process tend to balance and reduced the flood volume by 9 56 75 52 peak discharge by 14 25 89

mainly manifested in the energy dissipation of silt land and energy increase at the outside slope of dam body which was aggravated by downstream channel with steep slope the combination of fully

done on the effect of check dams on flood processes including the physical mechanism quantization and influence factors etc check dam affected the flood processes by raising the erosion basis after sedimentation increasing the sedimentary land infiltration and retaining the flood d√≠az guti√©rrez et al 2019 feng et al 2021 wang et al 2021 therefore the installation of check dams reduced the flood volume and flood peak lengthened the flood duration and delayed the occurrence of flood peak in catchment feng et al 2021 yuan et al 2022 meanwhile the presence of check dams also altered the spatial distribution of the runoff energy in main channel and moved the occurrences of maximum discharge further upstream wang et al 2021 it has been reported that the flood peak flood volume velocity and runoff shear stress in the completed dam system were reduced by 65 34 58 67 10 69 and 31 08 respectively yuan et al 2019 the above operation efficiencies of check dams were controlled by their number siltation depth site location etc and increased with the number and siltation depth of check dams rahmati et al 2019 feng et al 2021 yuan et al 2022 mathematical models are usually combined with field measurements to quantify the impacts of check dam on the flood processes including the swat model shi et al 2019 hec hms yazdi et al 2018 mike 11 model namadi et al 2014 dynamic coupling models mike she model and mike 11 model yuan et al 2018 2019 2022 the integrated hydrology model inhm tang et al 2020 ran et al 2021 etc however the physics based models which were used to quantify the impacts of check dams on flood processes are more sophisticated and are poorly scalable because of their computational requirements pal et al 2018 it is necessary to find a simpler model caesar lisflood is a numerical 2 d flow and sediment transport model with reduced complexity and deep integration poeppl et al 2019 which has been confirmed to be able to simulate flood events in complex flow conditions zellou and rahali 2017 therefore caesar lisflood is quite possible for simulating the hydrological process extensively the loess plateau of china is a severely eroded area with the greatest soil erosion rate worldwide which restricts ecological construction wang et al 2021 check dams are significant engineering structures to prevent soil erosion and promote sustainable development of ecology on the loess plateau zhao et al 2017 abbasi et al 2019 it has been reported that a total of 110 000 check dams have been built during the 1950 2000 s and their number still increased continuously on the loess plateau wang et al 2011 yuan et al 2019 these showed that the construction of check dam is still in integrated development stage on the loess plateau zhao et al 2012 abbasi et al 2019 however check dams built in the 1990 s and before have exceeded the siltation years and some of them have been fully filled hui et al 2020 the fully filled check dams are easy to be damaged by floods which will aggravate soil erosion and lead to flood disasters yang et al 2020 guo et al 2021 for instance among the damaged 10 check dams in 15 small catchments of yanhe river basin during the continuous rainstorms in july 2013 there are 9 check dams were fully filled wei et al 2015 meanwhile the occurrence frequency of extreme rainfall events has increased because of climate change and all check dams will be filled one day han et al 2020 tang et al 2020 which will lead to increase the damage risk of the fully filled check dams and aggravate the soil erosion therefore the prevention and control measures for reducing the damage risk of the fully filled check dams on the loess plateau need to be made urgently yang et al 2020 guo et al 2021 in order to make protective measures of fully filled check dams and promote the construction of check dam it is essential to quantify the impact of fully filled check dams on flood process and ascertain the spatial distribution of runoff erosion energy gao et al 2017 ran et al 2021 however previous researches have mainly focused on the operation period of check dam the impact of fully filled check dams on flood process are poorly understood it is still a challenge for making their prevention and control strategies according to catchment conditions therefore the impact of fully filled check dams on flood needs to be systematically researched further which are valuable for continuing to play a role in controlling flood and promoting the construction of check dam gao et al 2017 hui et al 2020 based on the above mentioned scientific gaps our study aimed to 1 estimate the suitability of caesar lisflood with reduced complexity and deep integration in simulating flood events on the loess plateau 2 quantify the impacts of fully filled check dams on flood processes 3 make the protective measures of fully filled check dams and propose the recommendations for promoting the construction of check dams in the future 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the shejiagou catchment with an area of 4 26 km2 was selected as the study area which is situated on the loess plateau china the study area has characteristics of broken terrain crisscross ravines and gullies with altitude between 920 m and 1140 m tang et al 2020 the mean slope in the study area is 22 8 and the left side of the catchment has a steeper slope fig 1 sandy loam is the main soil type which has a weak cohesion ran et al 2019 the land use is composed by woodland bare land cultivated land and grassland in 1959 the study area has a semiarid continental climate with the mean annual precipitation of 480 mm and mainly as short intense storms pal et al 2018 the comprehensive effect of environmental characteristics has caused serious soil erosion in the study area pal and galelli 2019 ran et al 2020 a total of 6 check dams are built to reduce soil loss in the shejiagou catchment pal et al 2018 pal and galelli 2019 bai et al 2020 tang et al 2020 ran et al 2021 fig 1 among which check dam b1 built near the catchment outlet in late 1964 has been fully filled at present ran et al 2021 2 2 data sources the data used in this study mainly include topography land use hydrology data the 10 m resolution digital elevation model dem had a suitable resolution for hydrological modelling ran et al 2021 the 10 m resolution land use data 1959 and the hydrology data including rainfall and discharge were obtained from the hydrologic experimental data of zizhou runoff experimental station which was issued by the yellow river water conservancy commission the rainfall runoff events of 28 august 1963 14 july 1964 and 2 august 1964 were selected in the study which had complete records higher discharge and occurred before the construction of all check dams fig 1 2 3 modeling 2 3 1 description of caesar lisflood caesar lisflood is a numerical 2 d flow and sediment transport model with reduced complexity and deep integration in algorithms zellou and rahali 2017 malgwi et al 2021 peleg et al 2021 which consists of hydrological model hydraulic model fluvial erosion and deposition model and slope processes model in catchment mode coulthard and van 2017 poeppl et al 2019 the hydrological model and hydraulic model were used in the study the hydrological model uses rainfall data to generate runoff for each cell based on the topmodel algorithm hoober et al 2017 zellou and rahali 2017 then the hydraulic model uses the lisflood fp hydrodynamic flow model to generate flow depths and velocities by routing surface runoff coulthard et al 2013 the basic data input into the system of caesar lisflood encompasses dem of the catchment and rainfall intensity mm h as shown in fig 2 malgwi et al 2021 caesar lisflood simulates the physical variables including discharge water depth flow velocity and direction shear stress etc zellou and rahali 2017 more details of caesar lisflood can be obtained in wiel et al 2007 coulthard et al 2002 2013 therefore the version 1 9j of caesar lisflood was used to simulate flood processes in the study https sourceforge net projects caesar lisflood files 2 3 2 data and parameters input in this study the 10 m resolution dem and rainfall runoff events as shown in fig 2 caesar lisflood consists of several individual parameters hoober et al 2017 which are determined based on the previous researches and model calibration in the study table 1 after calibrating and adjusting the previously published values a minimum difference between the observed and simulated values was gained fig 2 before each formal simulation the whole catchment was simulated until the discharge at outlet of the catchment reached 0 006 m3 s stably ran et al 2021 which is the average base discharge at the beginning of flood season in shejiagou catchment these conditions aimed to obtain an initial hydrological condition close to the actual situation of the catchment 2 3 3 model calibration and verification in order to accurately predict the discharge value the caesar lisflood requires a basic calibration and verification zhao et al 2017 during the calibration and verification period the nash sutcliff coefficient of efficiency ns and the coefficient of determination r2 were used to quantitatively evaluate the accuracy of caesar lisflood which can be calculated as follows shi et al 2019 1 n s i 1 n o i v 2 i 1 n s i o i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 2 r 2 i 1 n o i o s i s 2 i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n s i s 2 where o i is the observed value o is the average value of the observed values s i the simulated value s is the average value of the simulated values and n was the number of observed value generally if ns greater than 0 5 and r2 greater than 0 6 indicating the simulation results are considered satisfactory al mukhtar et al 2014 the modeling efficiency for the calibration the event of 28 august 1963 and the verification the events of 14 july 1964 and 2 august 1964 periods in the study are shown in fig 2 all the ns and r2 values of both calibration and verification were greater than 0 8 fig 2 which indicated the caesar lisflood can effectively simulate the dynamic changes of the flood process therefore the model was considered to be effective in modeling scenarios and used to quantitatively analyze the impact of fully filled check dams on flood process in this study 2 4 scenarios setting and analysis 2 4 1 scenarios setting based on the area of silt land the number and connection modes of check dams 9 scenarios were designed for modeling the impact of fully filled check dams on the flood processes fig 3 fig 4 table 2 scenario 0 s0 was the original natural channel scenario without check dams which was used as a control group in the other scenarios there are five check dams denoted as d1 d2 d3 d4 and d5 respectively fig 4 the check dam layout in the scenarios was determined based on the existing check dams in the study catchment fig 1 the silt land and dam body of these check dams were generated by modifying dem in arcgis and reached fully filled state as shown in fig 3 the purpose and distribution of check dams in each scenario were shown in table 2 the purpose of scenario varied based on the installed locations and characteristics of check dams s1 s2 and s3 were used for analyzing the influence of fully filled check dam on flood under the different areas of silt land the effects of the number of fully filled check dams on flood were analyzed based on s1 s4 and s5 s6 s7 and s8 aimed to reveal the influence of the connection modes of fully filled check dam on channel flood bai et al 2021 table 2 all scenarios were simulated by caesar lisflood based on the rainfall event of 2 august 1964 fig 2 and had same initial conditions and parameters as the calibration and verification period 2 4 2 the parameters of flood processes in order to analyze the impacts of fully filled check dams on flood processes discharge q flood volume fv peak discharge q p delay time of flood peak t p runoff kinetic energy f and runoff power w were used entwistle et al 2019 yuan et al 2019 feng et al 2021 q fv q p t p were obtained from the simulation results of caesar lisflood f and w were calculated based on the simulation results of caesar lisflood 1 runoff kinetic energy runoff kinetic energy is an important indicator in characterizing the erosion capacity of runoff zhang et al 2013 which can be calculated as follows 3 f rq v 2 2 g where f is runoff kinetic energy j r is the bulk density of the runoff 9800 n m3 g is gravitational acceleration 9 8 m s2 q is diacharge m3 s v is flow velocity m s q and v were obtained from the simulation results of caesar lisflood 2 runoff power runoff power is the power consumed by the flow of water per unit area yang et al 2019 the formula is as follows 4 œÑ œÅ grj 5 œâ œÑ v where œâ is the runoff power n m s œÑ is the shear stress n m2 œÅ is the water density 1000 kg m3 g is gravitational acceleration 9 8 m s2 j is the hydraulic slope which can be approximated by the slope s sin value m m niu et al 2020 r is the hydraulic radius which is replaced by runoff depth m li et al 2019 runoff depth came from the simulation results of caesar lisflood 2 4 3 scenario analysis there are differences in the effect of fully filled check dam on flood process among scenarios which were quantized by the reduction rate of variables r i these formulas are as follows 6 o ni o s 0 i o sni 7 r i 100 o ni o s 0 i where i is variables include discharge q flood volume fv and peak discharge q p runoff kinetic energy f and runoff power w r i is the reduction rate of variables r i based on scenario 0 s0 o s 0 i is simulated values of the i variable in s0 n is the code of scenario o sni is simulated values of the i variable in scenario n o ni is reduction of the i variable in scenario n coefficient variation cv accounts for relative variability in data sets the higher the cv the greater the

study all data processing and figures were made by using origin software version 2019a and arcgis 3 results and analysis 3 1 the impacts of fully filled check dams on runoff discharge table 3 and fig 5 show the effects of fully filled check dams on runoff in catchment outlet comparing with the s0 other scenarios had higher reduction rate of flood volume and peak discharge and lower coefficient variation of discharge the delay time of flood peak in all scenarios except s1 and s6 was greater than 3 min the results indicated that flood volume and peak discharge were noticeably reduced due to the presence of fully filled check dam which delayed the appearance of the flood peak and made the runoff process tend to balance for the scenarios in order to compare the silt land area of check dams s3 had higher reduction rate and the delay time of flood peak which were followed by s2 and s1 table 3 to the scenarios for comparing the number of check dams s5 had higher values in reduction rate and the delay time of flood peak followed by s4 and s1 in the scenarios for comparing the connection modes of check dams the reduction rate of flood volume and delay time of flood peak of s8 was greater than the sum of s6 and s7 in all scenarios s5 had better performance with 0 89 of coefficient variation for discharge 75 52 of the flood volume reduction rate and 18 min of the delay time for flood peak the above results indicated that the reduction rate of flood volume and peak discharge with the silt land area and number of check dams 3 2 the impacts of fully filled check dams on runoff kinetic energy the runoff kinetic energy reductions of the fully filled check dams in catchment outlet are shown by fig 6 for the coefficient variation of runoff kinetic energy in flood events s0 had higher values compared with s0 the kinetic energy reduction rates in flood events under the 8 scenarios were s5 99 75 s4 84 56 s3 83 62 s8 70 47 s2 60 06 s1 55 22 s7 46 33 s6 30 21 and the kinetic energy reduction rates at flood peak under the 8 scenarios were s5 99 89 s3 91 11 s4 83 98 s2 73 51 s1 69 73 s8 67 26 s7 59 64 s6 36 94 these results suggested that the fully filled check dams significantly reduced the runoff kinetic energy and smoothed the process of runoff kinetic energy in catchment outlet and hybrid dam systems or adding the silt land area or number of check dams helped reduce the runoff kinetic energy and smooth the process of runoff kinetic energy 3 3 the impacts of fully filled check dams on runoff power as shown in fig 7 comparing with s0 other scenarios had higher values in runoff power reduction rate and coefficient variation of runoff power in catchment outlet runoff power reduction rates in flood events under the 8 scenarios were s3 51 26 s2 30 59 s1 20 17 s5 95 23 s4 62 59 s1 20 17 and s8 52 25 s7 28 12 s6 21 81 respectively these results showed that the presence of fully filled check dams reduced the runoff power and flattened the runoff power process in catchment outlet these effects had different values among scenarios which depended on the silt land area number and connection modes of check dams with the silt land area number of check dams the capacity of fully filled check dams to reduce runoff power had increased and the capacity of hybrid dam systems to reduce runoff power was greater than the sum of series dam systems and parallel dam systems 4 discussion 4 1 the impacts of check dams layout on flood processes in main channel the impacts of fully filled check dams on runoff erosion energy runoff kinetic energy and runoff power are a complex process in temporal and spatial namadi et al 2014 shi et al 2019 feng et al 2021 in order to analyze the spatial distribution for the impacts of fully filled check dams on runoff erosion energy in main channel the results of s1 s2 and s3 in main channel at flood peak were used as an example as shown in fig 8 the reduction of runoff kinetic energy and runoff power began to increase at about 2500 m away from the catchment outlet and these values were greater in the dam silt land whereas these values started to fall at the dam body therefore the main channel was divided into 3 areas i e the area from dam body to outlet ab area of dam silt land al and 500 m area near the dam tail at fig 8a shown details of the different areas in s1 table 4 revealed that al had higher reduction rate of average runoff kinetic energy and runoff power in flood peak which were followed by ab and at above results indicated that the impacts of fully filled check dams on runoff erosion energy in main channel had existed difference between dam silt land and dam body this may be because fully filled check dam affects the flood processes by dam silt land and dam body gao et al 2017 dam silt land can flatten the channel and be used as a buffer noticeably reducing the flood velocity and runoff erosion energy d√≠az guti√©rrez et al 2019 ran et al 2021 however the outside slope of dam body forms a steep slope resulting in the increase of runoff erosion energy gao et al 2017 at the same time the research also showed that the fully filled check dams still reduced runoff kinetic energy and runoff power in the area near the dam tail which was similar to the existing research work related to this field ran et al 2021 this is possibly because the dam tail has the function of intercepting runoff and forming backwater area near the dam tail tang et al 2020 ran et al 2021 fig 3 there are significantly positive correlations between soil detachment rate and runoff power runoff kinetic energy respectively guo et al 2020 li and pan 2020 niu et al 2020 liu et al 2021 thus when the runoff kinetic energy and runoff power increase at the dam body fig 8 which will enhance runoff scour and cause dam body to damage during rainstorms zhang et al 2021 after the dam body is damaged the trapped sediment in the silt land will be eroded again and increase the disasters of water and soil loss even flood bai et al 2020 yang et al 2020 protecting the dam body is necessary in the study the prevention and control measures for reducing the damage risk of the fully filled check dams are proposed as follows 1 build additional drainage measures such as spillways which improve flood discharging capacity of catchment and reduce the runoff energy at the dam body in part bai et al 2021 2 increase the prevention and control for outside slope of the dam body such as deploying reasonable engineering measures and vegetation measures which improve the erosion resistance of the dam body gao et al 2017 3 promote upstream channel control such as building new check dams as shown in fig 9 the runoff kinetic energy and runoff power in dam body of d1 were significantly reduced after the presence of check dam in the upstream channel which increased with the number of check dams these above prevention and control measures reduce the risk of dam body damage to a certain extent but need some economic cost yazdi et al 2018 therefore it is necessary to determine the optimal measures for realizing the maximum efficiency of flood control and minimizing economic cost in the future research our results also suggested that the steep outside slope of fully filled check dams caused downstream channel scouring fig 10 and it could be reduced by flatting downstream channel table 5 the results of s4 s5 s7 and s8 in main channel at flood peak were used as an example which explained the above phenomena as shown in table 5 and fig 4 the average slope in 1000 m section ao from the outside slope of the dam body of d2 in both s7 and s8 without d1 was 12 74 and in both s4 and s5 with d1 was 9 41 respectively table 5 however r f and r œâ in ao at flood peak were s4 s7 s5 s8 respectively table 5 these results implied that downstream channel with steep slope increased runoff erosion energy and aggravated the soil erosion which was caused by the outside slope of check dam boix fayos et al 2007 lucas borja et al 2021 thus when building a new check dam it is necessary to select a relatively gentle downstream channel to reduce erosion fig 11 4 2 the impacts of check dams layout on flood processes in catchment outlet the sediment deposition in silt land can flatten channel increase the infiltration and form backwater area near the dam tail which decrease the runoff and flow velocity and increase time to peak d√≠az guti√©rrez et al 2019 nyssen et al 2010 guyassa et al 2017 pang et al 2020 yuan et al 2022 these directly led to the reduction of runoff erosion energy feng et al 2021 tang et al 2020 thus our study showed that the silt land could significantly reduce the runoff kinetic energy and runoff power fig 7 and fig 8 and the presence of fully filled check dams delayed the appearance of the flood peak made the runoff process tend to balance in catchment outlet and reduced the flood volume peak discharge runoff kinetic energy and runoff power table 3 fig 5 fig 6 and fig 7 previous studies also obtained similar results table 6 for example the study of tang et al 2020 had same study area as this study showed that fully filled check dams reduced flood volume by 3 76 34 10 under different deployment strategies and 90 mm of rainfall and 1 h of rainfall duration our results showed that fully filled reduced flood volume by 9 56 75 53 under different layout scenarios and 34 6 mm of rainfall and 1 h of rainfall duration thus when building a new check dam in a catchment it needs to be considered the energy dissipation capacity of pre existing check dam with the fully filled state which can reduce unnecessary check dam construction due to the energy dissipation of silt land the increase of silt land area or number of check dams or hybrid dam systems help reduce the flood volume and runoff erosion energy fig 5 fig 6 and fig 7 at the same time our study also found an interesting phenomenon as shown in table 2 and fig 4 the combinations of the check dam layout in s1 and s6 were the layout of s4 the layout in s6 and s7 were s8 the layout in s1 s6 and s7 were s5 respectively however the runoff power and flood volume reduction rate of s4 were greater than the sum of s1 and s6 s8 were greater than the sum of s6 and s7 and s5 were greater than the sum of s1 s6 and s7 respectively fig 12 these results demonstrated convincingly that the combination of check dams could amplify the flood control efficiency of individual dam check dams during operation period had a similar phenomenon for the sediment interception efficiency bai et al 2021 therefore it can be considered to increase the number of check dams to improve their flood control efficiency in a catchment the fully filled check dam effects the runoff erosion energy by silt land area gao et al 2017 and dam body height the silt land area depends on the height of the dam body table 2 in view of the above two factors this study further analyzed the runoff kinetic energy and runoff power per unit dam height in scenarios as shown in fig 12 s1 s2 and s3 had higher reduction rates per unit dam height in all scenarios implying that the fully filled check dams situated in the downstream channel were more available in reducing runoff erosion energy than those situated in the middle and upstream channel the result was on the whole consistent with the result of hassanli et al 2009 which focused on trapping fine sediment during operation period the most possible reasons are that d1 in s1 s2 and s3 has relatively larger control area and close to the catchment outlet fig 4 which causes d1 to reduce as much runoff erosion energy as possible lucas borja et al 2021 meanwhile there is significantly positive correlation between dam construction cost and height yazdi et al 2018 thus selecting the optimum locations of the check dams in a catchment is critical issue for minimizing the cost and maximizing energy dissipation in their fully filled period the above conclusions were obtained based on the rainfall event of 2 august 1964 and land use in 1959 however rainfall types e g different rainfall intensity different rainfall duration etc and land use patterns could greatly impact the flood control efficiency of fully filled check dams guyassa et al 2017 shi et al 2019 ran et al 2021 yuan et al 2022 thus the research for the influence of rainfall types and land use patterns on the flood control efficiency of fully filled check dams should be strengthen in the future 4 3 applicability of caesar lisflood model compared with other models the results of this study demonstrated that caesar lisflood had higher accuracy ns and r2 greater than 0 8 in hydrological modeling fig 2 for example the study of ran et al 2021 had the same hydrological data and study area as this study which employed the inhm to simulate runoff during floods and the ns was less than 0 8 meanwhile caesar lisflood can simulate the soil erosion process and generate the dynamic change of erosion and deposition in different spatio temporal scales coulthard et al 2013 which showed satisfactory modelling performance hoober et al 2017 coulthard et al 2012 coulthard et al 2012 tested the suitability of the caesar lisflood for simulating soil erosion of a 30 m experimental plot and obtained better performance with 0 83 of r2 xie et al 2018 and hoober et al 2017 tested the feasibility of using caesar lisflood to estimate erosional and depositional changes in temporal and spatial scales and showed that caesar lisflood was well suitable based on the above advantages caesar lisflood may be used to simulate the dynamic process for sedimentation of check dam and calculate their life expectancy on the loess plateau in the future research which will provide a scientific basis for optimizing the check dam layout pal et al 2013 5 conclusions our study used caesar lisflood model to simulate the impacts on flood processes of fully filled check dams with different numbers silt land areas and connection modes in the shejiagou catchment on the loess plateau these simulated conclusions are as follows 1 caesar lisflood model in the study obtained higher accuracy with both ns and r2 than 0 8 2 the presence of fully filled check dams reduced the flood volume peak discharge runoff kinetic energy and runoff power and the increase of the silt land area or number of check dams or hybrid dam systems helped enhance above effects 3 the impacts of fully filled check dams on runoff erosion energy mainly manifested in the energy dissipation of silt land and energy increase at the outside slope of dam body which was aggravated by downstream channel with steep slope the combination of fully filled check dams could amplify the flood control efficiency of individual dam 4 for above reason the prevention and control measures for reducing the damage risk of the fully filled check dams are proposed including building additional drainage measures increasing the prevention and control of the steep outside slope of dam body and promoting upstream channel control meanwhile the following recommendations are made to promote the construction of check dam 1 when building a new check dam in a catchment it needs to be considered the energy dissipation capacity of pre existing check dam with the fully filled state which can avoid unnecessary check dam construction 2 in order to obtain minimizing the cost and maximizing energy dissipation in their fully filled period it is critical issue to select the optimum location of the check dams in a catchment 3 in case of sufficient dam construction costs it can be considered to increase the number of check dams to improve their operation efficiency those measures provide a

7751,study region the shejiagou catchment on the loess plateau china study focus this study used caesar lisflood to simulate the impacts on flood processes of fully filled check dams with different numbers silt land areas and connection modes according to the model results the protective measures of fully filled check dams and recommendations for promoting the construction of check dams were proposed in the study new hydrological insights for the region caesar lisflood model in the study obtained higher accuracy with both the nash sutcliff coefficient of efficiency and the coefficient of

mainly manifested in the energy dissipation of silt land and energy increase at the outside slope of dam body which was aggravated by downstream channel with steep slope the combination of fully

have permission to share data 1 introduction check dam is effective hydraulic structure for retaining runoff and inducing sedimentation conservation which is built across a channel or gully abbasi et al 2019 ran et al 2021 the water resources stored in the check dams can relieve the crisis of water resources in arid areas lucas borja et al 2021 meanwhile the sedimentation trapped in the check dams can form farmland and increase agriculture production on the loess plateau china zhao et al 2017 lucas borja et al 2021 check dams are extensively built all around the world for preventing water loss and soil erosion abbasi et al 2019 however the flood attenuation and sediment control efficiency of check dams are governed by their layout and structural feature rahmati et al 2019 for this reason studying the effect of check dams on flood processes to improve their performance becomes the focus research polyakov et al 2014 feng et al 2021 lucas borja et al 2021 tremendous researches have been done on the effect of check dams on flood processes including the physical mechanism quantization and influence factors etc check dam affected the flood processes by raising the erosion basis after sedimentation increasing the sedimentary land infiltration and retaining the flood d√≠az guti√©rrez et al 2019 feng et al 2021 wang et al 2021 therefore the installation of check dams reduced the flood volume and flood peak lengthened the flood duration and delayed the occurrence of flood peak in catchment feng et al 2021 yuan et al 2022 meanwhile the presence of check dams also altered the spatial distribution of the runoff energy in main channel and moved the occurrences of maximum discharge further upstream wang et al 2021 it has been reported that the flood peak flood volume velocity and runoff shear stress in the completed dam system were reduced by 65 34 58 67 10 69 and 31 08 respectively yuan et al 2019 the above operation efficiencies of check dams were controlled by their number siltation depth site location etc and increased with the number and siltation depth of check dams rahmati et al 2019 feng et al 2021 yuan et al 2022 mathematical models are usually combined with field measurements to quantify the impacts of check dam on the flood processes including the swat model shi et al 2019 hec hms yazdi et al 2018 mike 11 model namadi et al 2014 dynamic coupling models mike she model and mike 11 model yuan et al 2018 2019 2022 the integrated hydrology model inhm tang et al 2020 ran et al 2021 etc however the physics based models which were used to quantify the impacts of check dams on flood processes are more sophisticated and are poorly scalable because of their computational requirements pal et al 2018 it is necessary to find a simpler model caesar lisflood is a numerical 2 d flow and sediment transport model with reduced complexity and deep integration poeppl et al 2019 which has been confirmed to be able to simulate flood events in complex flow conditions zellou and rahali 2017 therefore caesar lisflood is quite possible for simulating the hydrological process extensively the loess plateau of china is a severely eroded area with the greatest soil erosion rate worldwide which restricts ecological construction wang et al 2021 check dams are significant engineering structures to prevent soil erosion and promote sustainable development of ecology on the loess plateau zhao et al 2017 abbasi et al 2019 it has been reported that a total of 110 000 check dams have been built during the 1950 2000 s and their number still increased continuously on the loess plateau wang et al 2011 yuan et al 2019 these showed that the construction of check dam is still in integrated development stage on the loess plateau zhao et al 2012 abbasi et al 2019 however check dams built in the 1990 s and before have exceeded the siltation years and some of them have been fully filled hui et al 2020 the fully filled check dams are easy to be damaged by floods which will aggravate soil erosion and lead to flood disasters yang et al 2020 guo et al 2021 for instance among the damaged 10 check dams in 15 small catchments of yanhe river basin during the continuous rainstorms in july 2013 there are 9 check dams were fully filled wei et al 2015 meanwhile the occurrence frequency of extreme rainfall events has increased because of climate change and all check dams will be filled one day han et al 2020 tang et al 2020 which will lead to increase the damage risk of the fully filled check dams and aggravate the soil erosion therefore the prevention and control measures for reducing the damage risk of the fully filled check dams on the loess plateau need to be made urgently yang et al 2020 guo et al 2021 in order to make protective measures of fully filled check dams and promote the construction of check dam it is essential to quantify the impact of fully filled check dams on flood process and ascertain the spatial distribution of runoff erosion energy gao et al 2017 ran et al 2021 however previous researches have mainly focused on the operation period of check dam the impact of fully filled check dams on flood process are poorly understood it is still a challenge for making their prevention and control strategies according to catchment conditions therefore the impact of fully filled check dams on flood needs to be systematically researched further which are valuable for continuing to play a role in controlling flood and promoting the construction of check dam gao et al 2017 hui et al 2020 based on the above mentioned scientific gaps our study aimed to 1 estimate the suitability of caesar lisflood with reduced complexity and deep integration in simulating flood events on the loess plateau 2 quantify the impacts of fully filled check dams on flood processes 3 make the protective measures of fully filled check dams and propose the recommendations for promoting the construction of check dams in the future 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the shejiagou catchment with an area of 4 26 km2 was selected as the study area which is situated on the loess plateau china the study area has characteristics of broken terrain crisscross ravines and gullies with altitude between 920 m and 1140 m tang et al 2020 the mean slope in the study area is 22 8 and the left side of the catchment has a steeper slope fig 1 sandy loam is the main soil type which has a weak cohesion ran et al 2019 the land use is composed by woodland bare land cultivated land and grassland in 1959 the study area has a semiarid continental climate with the mean annual precipitation of 480 mm and mainly as short intense storms pal et al 2018 the comprehensive effect of environmental characteristics has caused serious soil erosion in the study area pal and galelli 2019 ran et al 2020 a total of 6 check dams are built to reduce soil loss in the shejiagou catchment pal et al 2018 pal and galelli 2019 bai et al 2020 tang et al 2020 ran et al 2021 fig 1 among which check dam b1 built near the catchment outlet in late 1964 has been fully filled at present ran et al 2021 2 2 data sources the data used in this study mainly include topography land use hydrology data the 10 m resolution digital elevation model dem had a suitable resolution for hydrological modelling ran et al 2021 the 10 m resolution land use data 1959 and the hydrology data including rainfall and discharge were obtained from the hydrologic experimental data of zizhou runoff experimental station which was issued by the yellow river water conservancy commission the rainfall runoff events of 28 august 1963 14 july 1964 and 2 august 1964 were selected in the study which had complete records higher discharge and occurred before the construction of all check dams fig 1 2 3 modeling 2 3 1 description of caesar lisflood caesar lisflood is a numerical 2 d flow and sediment transport model with reduced complexity and deep integration in algorithms zellou and rahali 2017 malgwi et al 2021 peleg et al 2021 which consists of hydrological model hydraulic model fluvial erosion and deposition model and slope processes model in catchment mode coulthard and van 2017 poeppl et al 2019 the hydrological model and hydraulic model were used in the study the hydrological model uses rainfall data to generate runoff for each cell based on the topmodel algorithm hoober et al 2017 zellou and rahali 2017 then the hydraulic model uses the lisflood fp hydrodynamic flow model to generate flow depths and velocities by routing surface runoff coulthard et al 2013 the basic data input into the system of caesar lisflood encompasses dem of the catchment and rainfall intensity mm h as shown in fig 2 malgwi et al 2021 caesar lisflood simulates the physical variables including discharge water depth flow velocity and direction shear stress etc zellou and rahali 2017 more details of caesar lisflood can be obtained in wiel et al 2007 coulthard et al 2002 2013 therefore the version 1 9j of caesar lisflood was used to simulate flood processes in the study https sourceforge net projects caesar lisflood files 2 3 2 data and parameters input in this study the 10 m resolution dem and rainfall runoff events as shown in fig 2 caesar lisflood consists of several individual parameters hoober et al 2017 which are determined based on the previous researches and model calibration in the study table 1 after calibrating and adjusting the previously published values a minimum difference between the observed and simulated values was gained fig 2 before each formal simulation the whole catchment was simulated until the discharge at outlet of the catchment reached 0 006 m3 s stably ran et al 2021 which is the average base discharge at the beginning of flood season in shejiagou catchment these conditions aimed to obtain an initial hydrological condition close to the actual situation of the catchment 2 3 3 model calibration and verification in order to accurately predict the discharge value the caesar lisflood requires a basic calibration and verification zhao et al 2017 during the calibration and verification period the nash sutcliff coefficient of efficiency ns and the coefficient of determination r2 were used to quantitatively evaluate the accuracy of caesar lisflood which can be calculated as follows shi et al 2019 1 n s i 1 n o i v 2 i 1 n s i o i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 2 r 2 i 1 n o i o s i s 2 i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n s i s 2 where o i is the observed value o is the average value of the observed values s i the simulated value s is the average value of the simulated values and n was the number of observed value generally if ns greater than 0 5 and r2 greater than 0 6 indicating the simulation results are considered satisfactory al mukhtar et al 2014 the modeling efficiency for the calibration the event of 28 august 1963 and the verification the events of 14 july 1964 and 2 august 1964 periods in the study are shown in fig 2 all the ns and r2 values of both calibration and verification were greater than 0 8 fig 2 which indicated the caesar lisflood can effectively simulate the dynamic changes of the flood process therefore the model was considered to be effective in modeling scenarios and used to quantitatively analyze the impact of fully filled check dams on flood process in this study 2 4 scenarios setting and analysis 2 4 1 scenarios setting based on the area of silt land the number and connection modes of check dams 9 scenarios were designed for modeling the impact of fully filled check dams on the flood processes fig 3 fig 4 table 2 scenario 0 s0 was the original natural channel scenario without check dams which was used as a control group in the other scenarios there are five check dams denoted as d1 d2 d3 d4 and d5 respectively fig 4 the check dam layout in the scenarios was determined based on the existing check dams in the study catchment fig 1 the silt land and dam body of these check dams were generated by modifying dem in arcgis and reached fully filled state as shown in fig 3 the purpose and distribution of check dams in each scenario were shown in table 2 the purpose of scenario varied based on the installed locations and characteristics of check dams s1 s2 and s3 were used for analyzing the influence of fully filled check dam on flood under the different areas of silt land the effects of the number of fully filled check dams on flood were analyzed based on s1 s4 and s5 s6 s7 and s8 aimed to reveal the influence of the connection modes of fully filled check dam on channel flood bai et al 2021 table 2 all scenarios were simulated by caesar lisflood based on the rainfall event of 2 august 1964 fig 2 and had same initial conditions and parameters as the calibration and verification period 2 4 2 the parameters of flood processes in order to analyze the impacts of fully filled check dams on flood processes discharge q flood volume fv peak discharge q p delay time of flood peak t p runoff kinetic energy f and runoff power w were used entwistle et al 2019 yuan et al 2019 feng et al 2021 q fv q p t p were obtained from the simulation results of caesar lisflood f and w were calculated based on the simulation results of caesar lisflood 1 runoff kinetic energy runoff kinetic energy is an important indicator in characterizing the erosion capacity of runoff zhang et al 2013 which can be calculated as follows 3 f rq v 2 2 g where f is runoff kinetic energy j r is the bulk density of the runoff 9800 n m3 g is gravitational acceleration 9 8 m s2 q is diacharge m3 s v is flow velocity m s q and v were obtained from the simulation results of caesar lisflood 2 runoff power runoff power is the power consumed by the flow of water per unit area yang et al 2019 the formula is as follows 4 œÑ œÅ grj 5 œâ œÑ v where œâ is the runoff power n m s œÑ is the shear stress n m2 œÅ is the water density 1000 kg m3 g is gravitational acceleration 9 8 m s2 j is the hydraulic slope which can be approximated by the slope s sin value m m niu et al 2020 r is the hydraulic radius which is replaced by runoff depth m li et al 2019 runoff depth came from the simulation results of caesar lisflood 2 4 3 scenario analysis there are differences in the effect of fully filled check dam on flood process among scenarios which were quantized by the reduction rate of variables r i these formulas are as follows 6 o ni o s 0 i o sni 7 r i 100 o ni o s 0 i where i is variables include discharge q flood volume fv and peak discharge q p runoff kinetic energy f and runoff power w r i is the reduction rate of variables r i based on scenario 0 s0 o s 0 i is simulated values of the i variable in s0 n is the code of scenario o sni is simulated values of the i variable in scenario n o ni is reduction of the i variable in scenario n coefficient variation cv accounts for relative variability in data sets the higher the cv the greater the dispersion peleg et al 2021 these formulas are as follows 8 cv i œÉ i Œº i where i is variables œÉ i is the standard deviation of i Œº i is the mean of i cv i is the coefficient variation of i in the study all data processing and figures were made by using origin software version 2019a and arcgis 3 results and analysis 3 1 the impacts of fully filled check dams on runoff discharge table 3 and fig 5 show the effects of fully filled check dams on runoff in catchment outlet comparing with the s0 other scenarios had higher reduction rate of flood volume and peak discharge and lower coefficient variation of discharge the delay time of flood peak in all scenarios except s1 and s6 was greater than 3 min the results indicated that flood volume and peak discharge were noticeably reduced due to the presence of fully filled check dam which delayed the appearance of the flood peak and made the runoff process tend to balance for the scenarios in order to compare the silt land area of check dams s3 had higher reduction rate and the delay time of flood peak which were followed by s2 and s1 table 3 to the scenarios for comparing the number of check dams s5 had higher values in reduction rate and the delay time of flood peak followed by s4 and s1 in the scenarios for comparing the connection modes of check dams the reduction rate of flood volume and delay time of flood peak of s8 was greater than the sum of s6 and s7 in all scenarios s5 had better performance with 0 89 of coefficient variation for discharge 75 52 of the flood volume reduction rate and 18 min of the delay time for flood peak the above results indicated that the reduction rate of flood volume and peak discharge with the silt land area and number of check dams 3 2 the impacts of fully filled check dams on runoff kinetic energy the runoff kinetic energy reductions of the fully filled check dams in catchment outlet are shown by fig 6 for the coefficient variation of runoff kinetic energy in flood events s0 had higher values compared with s0 the kinetic energy reduction rates in flood events under the 8 scenarios were s5 99 75 s4 84 56 s3 83 62 s8 70 47 s2 60 06 s1 55 22 s7 46 33 s6 30 21 and the kinetic energy reduction rates at flood peak under the 8 scenarios were s5 99 89 s3 91 11 s4 83 98 s2 73 51 s1 69 73 s8 67 26 s7 59 64 s6 36 94 these results suggested that the fully filled check dams significantly reduced the runoff kinetic energy and smoothed the process of runoff kinetic energy in catchment outlet and hybrid dam systems or adding the silt land area or number of check dams helped reduce the runoff kinetic energy and smooth the process of runoff kinetic energy 3 3 the impacts of fully filled check dams on runoff power as shown in fig 7 comparing with s0 other scenarios had higher values in runoff power reduction rate and coefficient variation of runoff power in catchment outlet runoff power reduction rates in flood events under the 8 scenarios were s3 51 26 s2 30 59 s1 20 17 s5 95 23 s4 62 59 s1 20 17 and s8 52 25 s7 28 12 s6 21 81 respectively these results showed that the presence of fully filled check dams reduced the runoff power and flattened the runoff power process in catchment outlet these effects had different values among scenarios which depended on the silt land area number and connection modes of check dams with the silt land area number of check dams the capacity of fully filled check dams to reduce runoff power had increased and the capacity of hybrid dam systems to reduce runoff power was greater than the sum of series dam systems and parallel dam systems 4 discussion 4 1 the impacts of check dams layout on flood processes in main channel the impacts of fully filled check dams on runoff erosion energy runoff kinetic energy and runoff power are a complex process in temporal and spatial namadi et al 2014 shi et al 2019 feng et al 2021 in order to analyze the spatial distribution for the impacts of fully filled check dams on runoff erosion energy in main channel the results of s1 s2 and s3 in main channel at flood peak were used as an example as shown in fig 8 the reduction of runoff kinetic energy and runoff power began to increase at about 2500 m away from the catchment outlet and these values were greater in the dam silt land whereas these values started to fall at the dam body therefore the main channel was divided into 3 areas i e the area from dam body to outlet ab area of dam silt land al and 500 m area near the dam tail at fig 8a shown details of the different areas in s1 table 4 revealed that al had higher reduction rate of average runoff kinetic energy and runoff power in flood peak which were followed by ab and at above results indicated that the impacts of fully filled check dams on runoff erosion energy in main channel had existed difference between dam silt land and dam body this may be because fully filled check dam affects the flood processes by dam silt land and dam body gao et al 2017 dam silt land can flatten the channel and be used as a buffer noticeably reducing the flood velocity and runoff erosion energy d√≠az guti√©rrez et al 2019 ran et al 2021 however the outside slope of dam body forms a steep slope resulting in the increase of runoff erosion energy gao et al 2017 at the same time the research also showed that the fully filled check dams still reduced runoff kinetic energy and runoff power in the area near the dam tail which was similar to the existing research work related to this field ran et al 2021 this is possibly because the dam tail has the function of intercepting runoff and forming backwater area near the dam tail tang et al 2020 ran et al 2021 fig 3 there are significantly positive correlations between soil detachment rate and runoff power runoff kinetic energy respectively guo et al 2020 li and pan 2020 niu et al 2020 liu et al 2021 thus when the runoff kinetic energy and runoff power increase at the dam body fig 8 which will enhance runoff scour and cause dam body to damage during rainstorms zhang et al 2021 after the dam body is damaged the trapped sediment in the silt land will be eroded again and increase the disasters of water and soil loss even flood bai et al 2020 yang et al 2020 protecting the dam body is necessary in the study the prevention and control measures for reducing the damage risk of the fully filled check dams are proposed as follows 1 build additional drainage measures such as spillways which improve flood discharging capacity of catchment and reduce the runoff energy at the dam body in part bai et al 2021 2 increase the prevention and control for outside slope of the dam body such as deploying reasonable engineering measures and vegetation measures which improve the erosion resistance of the dam body gao et al 2017 3 promote upstream channel control such as building new check dams as shown in fig 9 the runoff kinetic energy and runoff power in dam body of d1 were significantly reduced after the presence of check dam in the upstream channel which increased with the number of check dams these above prevention and control measures reduce the risk of dam body damage to a certain extent but need some economic cost yazdi et al 2018 therefore it is necessary to determine the optimal measures for realizing the maximum efficiency of flood control and minimizing economic cost in the future research our results also suggested that the steep outside slope of fully filled check dams caused downstream channel scouring fig 10 and it could be reduced by flatting downstream channel table 5 the results of s4 s5 s7 and s8 in main channel at flood peak were used as an example which explained the above phenomena as shown in table 5 and fig 4 the average slope in 1000 m section ao from the outside slope of the dam body of d2 in both s7 and s8 without d1 was 12 74 and in both s4 and s5 with d1 was 9 41 respectively table 5 however r f and r œâ in ao at flood peak were s4 s7 s5 s8 respectively table 5 these results implied that downstream channel with steep slope increased runoff erosion energy and aggravated the soil erosion which was caused by the outside slope of check dam boix fayos et al 2007 lucas borja et al 2021 thus when building a new check dam it is necessary to select a relatively gentle downstream channel to reduce erosion fig 11 4 2 the impacts of check dams layout on flood processes in catchment outlet the sediment deposition in silt land can flatten channel increase the infiltration and form backwater area near the dam tail which decrease the runoff and flow velocity and increase time to peak d√≠az guti√©rrez et al 2019 nyssen et al 2010 guyassa et al 2017 pang et al 2020 yuan et al 2022 these directly led to the reduction of runoff erosion energy feng et al 2021 tang et al 2020 thus our study showed that the silt land could significantly reduce the runoff kinetic energy and runoff power fig 7 and fig 8 and the presence of fully filled check dams delayed the appearance of the flood peak made the runoff process tend to balance in catchment outlet and reduced the flood volume peak discharge runoff kinetic energy and runoff power table 3 fig 5 fig 6 and fig 7 previous studies also obtained similar results table 6 for example the study of tang et al 2020 had same study area as this study showed that fully filled check dams reduced flood volume by 3 76 34 10 under different deployment strategies and 90 mm of rainfall and 1 h of rainfall duration our results showed that fully filled reduced flood volume by 9 56 75 53 under different layout scenarios and 34 6 mm of rainfall and 1 h of rainfall duration thus when building a new check dam in a catchment it needs to be considered the energy dissipation capacity of pre existing check dam with the fully filled state which can reduce unnecessary check dam construction due to the energy dissipation of silt land the increase of silt land area or number of check dams or hybrid dam systems help reduce the flood volume and runoff erosion energy fig 5 fig 6 and fig 7 at the same time our study also found an interesting phenomenon as shown in table 2 and fig 4 the combinations of the check dam layout in s1 and s6 were the layout of s4 the layout in s6 and s7 were s8 the layout in s1 s6 and s7 were s5 respectively however the runoff power and flood volume reduction rate of s4 were greater than the sum of s1 and s6 s8 were greater than the sum of s6 and s7 and s5 were greater than the sum of s1 s6 and s7 respectively fig 12 these results demonstrated convincingly that the combination of check dams could amplify the flood control efficiency of individual dam check dams during operation period had a similar phenomenon for the sediment interception efficiency bai et al 2021 therefore it can be considered to increase the number of check dams to improve their flood control efficiency in a catchment the fully filled check dam effects the runoff erosion energy by silt land area gao et al 2017 and dam body height the silt land area depends on the height of the dam body table 2 in view of the above two factors this study further analyzed the runoff kinetic energy and runoff power per unit dam height in scenarios as shown in fig 12 s1 s2 and s3 had higher reduction rates per unit dam height in all scenarios implying that the fully filled check dams situated in the downstream channel were more available in reducing runoff erosion energy than those situated in the middle and upstream channel the result was on the whole consistent with the result of hassanli et al 2009 which focused on trapping fine sediment during operation period the most possible reasons are that d1 in s1 s2 and s3 has relatively larger control area and close to the catchment outlet fig 4 which causes d1 to reduce as much runoff erosion energy as possible lucas borja et al 2021 meanwhile there is significantly positive correlation between dam construction cost and height yazdi et al 2018 thus selecting the optimum locations of the check dams in a catchment is critical issue for minimizing the cost and maximizing energy dissipation in their fully filled period the above conclusions were obtained based on the rainfall event of 2 august 1964 and land use in 1959 however rainfall types e g different rainfall intensity different rainfall duration etc and land use patterns could greatly impact the flood control efficiency of fully filled check dams guyassa et al 2017 shi et al 2019 ran et al 2021 yuan et al 2022 thus the research for the influence of rainfall types and land use patterns on the flood control efficiency of fully filled check dams should be strengthen in the future 4 3 applicability of caesar lisflood model compared with other models the results of this study demonstrated that caesar lisflood had higher accuracy ns and r2 greater than 0 8 in hydrological modeling fig 2 for example the study of ran et al 2021 had the same hydrological data and study area as this study which employed the inhm to simulate runoff during floods and the ns was less than 0 8 meanwhile caesar lisflood can simulate the soil erosion process and generate the dynamic change of erosion and deposition in different spatio temporal scales coulthard et al 2013 which showed satisfactory modelling performance hoober et al 2017 coulthard et al 2012 coulthard et al 2012 tested the suitability of the caesar lisflood for simulating soil erosion of a 30 m experimental plot and obtained better performance with 0 83 of r2 xie et al 2018 and hoober et al 2017 tested the feasibility of using caesar lisflood to estimate erosional and depositional changes in temporal and spatial scales and showed that caesar lisflood was well suitable based on the above advantages caesar lisflood may be used to simulate the dynamic process for sedimentation of check dam and calculate their life expectancy on the loess plateau in the future research which will provide a scientific basis for optimizing the check dam layout pal et al 2013 5 conclusions our study used caesar lisflood model to simulate the impacts on flood processes of fully filled check dams with different numbers silt land areas and connection modes in the shejiagou catchment on the loess plateau these simulated conclusions are as follows 1 caesar lisflood model in the study obtained higher accuracy with both ns and r2 than 0 8 2 the presence of fully filled check dams reduced the flood volume peak discharge runoff kinetic energy and runoff power and the increase of the silt land area or number of check dams or hybrid dam systems helped enhance above effects 3 the impacts of fully filled check dams on runoff erosion energy mainly manifested in the energy dissipation of silt land and energy increase at the outside slope of dam body which was aggravated by downstream channel with steep slope the combination of fully filled check dams could amplify the flood control efficiency of individual dam 4 for above reason the prevention and control measures for reducing the damage risk of the fully filled check dams are proposed including building additional drainage measures increasing the prevention and control of the steep outside slope of dam body and promoting upstream channel control meanwhile the following recommendations are made to promote the construction of check dam 1 when building a new check dam in a catchment it needs to be considered the energy dissipation capacity of pre existing check dam with the fully filled state which can avoid unnecessary check dam construction 2 in order to obtain minimizing the cost and maximizing energy dissipation in their fully filled period it is critical issue to select the optimum location of the check dams in a catchment 3 in case of sufficient dam construction costs it can be considered to increase the number of check dams to improve their operation efficiency those measures provide a scientific basis for strengthen fully filled check dams and the layout of check dams in the future on the chinese loess plateau credit authorship contribution statement yulan chen conceptualization

gdem2 aw3d30 tandem x swat lai giang river basin vietnam data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction the digital elevation model dem due to advancements in computer and satellite technology has contributed significantly to the accuracy of most hydrological models lin et al 2010 2013 rocha et al 2020 tan et al 2015 tran et al 2022 dem is a critical geographic input for hydrological models that define main basin characteristics such as sub basins and river networks for example blanchard et al 2010 and bourdin et al 2012 mentioned the importance of dem input for hydrological models due to its representation of watershed topography furthermore many other studies such as gautam et al 2019 lin et al 2013 tan et al 2018 have then followed to progressively reveal the accuracy of dem input which is critical and can be used to assess the dependability of the generated hydrologic and topographic features however due to the uncertainty of many factors source resolution collection techniques and calibration methods this critical input might impact the results of numerical models considerably either positively or negatively gonga saholiariliva et al 2011 wechsler 2007 for new dem products it is necessary to determine the uncertainty of them which has become an essential topic for hydrological applications uuemaa et al 2020 several previous studies by gonga saholiariliva et al 2011 hawker et al 2019 tan et al 2015 2018 uuemaa et al 2020 and xuan hong et al 2022 have focused on finding a optimal methodology to understand and assess the differences of dem products li and wong 2010 have conducted the similar assessment with the use of different resolutions and sources of several dem products additionally lin et al 2013 and zhang et al 2014 have also assessed the combination of different dem resolutions and sources to understand dem related uncertainties further their key findings exhibited that with different dems the extraction delineation of catchment sub basins river networks streamflow simulation flood peak and total runoff volume would be impacted in recent years tan et al 2015 and zeeshan et al 2021 also confirmed that the dem resolutions and sources affect streamflow simulation in hydrological models such as swat soil water assessment tool model thus in this study we aim to quantify the uncertainty and reliability of several dems utilized in a single objective study area in this case the lai giang river basin central vietnam these following dem products were chosen based on their availability for the chosen study area as well as the need to have a better understanding 1 multi error removed improved terrain dem merit 2 nasadem nasa 3 shuttle radar topography mission srtm 4 the terra advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer aster global digital elevation model gdem version 2 aster gdem2 5 alos global digital surface model aw3d30 and 6 terrasar x add on for digital elevation measurements tandem x these dem products have been partially revealed by crippen et al 2016 gonz√°lez et al 2020 pham et al 2018 xu et al 2016 yamazaki et al 2017 and zeeshan et al 2021 but in separated works this study aims to evaluate the chosen dem products using a comprehensive assessment same assessment using hydrological model to reduce the uncertainties and better understand them which has been revealed but in separated works charrier et al 2012 crippen et al 2016 gonga saholiariliva et al 2011 hawker et al 2019 hirt et al 2010 li and wong 2010 takaku et al 2020 tan et al 2015 2018 tucker et al 2001 uuemaa et al 2020 wechsler 2007 xu et al 2016 yamazaki et al 2017 additionally these studies have provided good and valuable insights however a more robust comparison is possible using the single case study of a same study area in this study we would then investigate the dem products performance using a comprehensive assessment and assess the hydrological applications of them in a central vietnam basin which has not been studied before the nasa dem a near global elevation project introduced by thoroughly reprocessing shuttle radar topography mission srtm was publicly released in february 2020 for assessment and use crippen et al 2016 uuemaa et al 2020 the limitation of the number of studies regarding the performance and capability of this new dem in terms of hydrological application is skeptical especially for asia h li et al 2022 have recently revealed the assessment for nasa and aw3d30 in which they concluded that aw3d30 showed better vertical accuracy compared to nasa dem however two constraints of their study should be considered 1 some areas are highly covered by dynamic natures i e snow and ice water body and wetland as well as urban areas i e artificial surfaces and 2 hydrological applications i e streamflow flood peak have not been performed additionally we have no understanding how this newly released dem perform in vietnam and to demonstrate its competence and appropriate application for case studies in different regions is an interesting topic besides due to the complex of vietnam terrain profile there is a rising need to have an accurate hydrological monitoring and forecasting that are critical for proper water resources management however most previous studies assessing dems have been conducted outside of vietnam territory these reasons have encouraged us to conduct this study in which we would focus on i having a general and comprehensive assessments for commonly used dem products ii increase understanding and verify previous studies key findings addressing the nasa dem product s performance under a comparison to other dems and compare it with its original version srtm dem iii revealing the accuracy of this product for vietnam related studies in this case is a basin in central vietnam this study would focus on the lai giang river basin central vietnam which has a complex terrain profile and significant elevation changes nguyen 2013 our methodology would consider the river basin characteristics and the uncertainty impacts of dem products on the simulated streamflow using a hydrological model these key findings contribute to understanding how nasa dem and other dems could be used for the lai giang river basin or central vietnam in general under a comprehensive comparison of chosen dem products supporting regional decision makers and stakeholders plans for hydrological related issues moreover a new cross validation approach to validate quality of dem products used for hydrological applications has been proposed and performed it would then show how the calibration procedure impacts the performance of dems in terms of the hydrological related applications 2 study area the lai giang river basin lrb is the second largest watershed in binh dinh province central vietnam with a total area of approximately 1279 km2 fig 1 and geographic coordinates ranging from 14o10 to 14o45 north latitude and 108o44 to 109o10 east longitude nguyen 2013 the lrb is formed by the confluence of two rivers an lao and kim son which join at the border between the hoai an and hoai nhon districts fig 1 b the kim son river is located in hoai an district binh dinh province which is around 65 kilometers long with a basin area of approximately 575 kilometers whereas the an lao river is about 85 kilometers long with a basin area of roughly 697 kilometers lrb is in a mountainous region with low hills occupying more than 80 of the lrb the average

technology of binh dinh province and officially published by the binh dinh province committee of damage response search and survey https pcttbinhdinh gov vn the daily runoff data were collected in this study within a 23 year simulation period 1998 2020 but not including 3 years of the model warm up period 1995 1998 due to the data availability the observed water discharge has been chosen and extracted from the an lao hydrological station and used throughout this case study for the model calibration and validation fig 1 a the daily precipitation data has been collected from monre ministry

variations the quality of flat regions improves considerably and river networks are depicted furthermore the vertical accuracy of merit is 12 m global with further detailed explanation by yamazaki et al 2017 nasa dem nasadem publicly released in february 2020 is a near global elevation project introduced by thoroughly reprocessing shuttle radar topography mission srtm radar data its accuracy has been improved by using auxiliary data from various datasets with 1 spatial resolution aster gdem prism glas and icesat approximately 30 m on the equator uuemaa et al 2020 since nasa dem is relatively new compared to other free and widely available dem products its vertical accuracy has been revealed as 5 3 m united states buckley et al 2020 and 6 59 m china h li et al 2022 srtm dem shuttle radar

industry meti it was produced using the aster stereoscopic data collected by two telescopes on the terra satellite tachikawa et al 2011 the first version of aster gdem 2009 was reported to contain artifact problems dewitt et al 2015 however an improved version of it was released in 2011 with the same resolution of 30 m it has improved over the original version v1 in geo referencing including more scenes gathered between 2008 and 2011 with a smaller correlation kernel and higher spatial resolution tachikawa et al 2011 this dem product has been chosen to use in this study detailed descriptions and findings of this dem product from previous studies could be found in gesch et al 2014 gonz√°lez et al 2020 and aster gdem validation team 2011 with the vertical accuracy below 12 m

accuracy has been determined around 5 m global takaku et al 2020 uuemaa et al 2020 tandem x dem terrasar x add on for digital elevation measurements is the product of a collaboration between the german aerospace center dlr and airbus defense space ads it was built using interferometric synthetic aperture radar insar collected by radar satellites terrasar x and tandem x with a total working lifespan of around 4 5 years in late 2018 the entirely free global product tandem x dem v1 0 with 90 m spatial resolution was published hawker et al 2019 and the vertical error has been determined to be approximately less than 10 m wessel 2016 the summary of dem product information used in this study is presented in table 1 4 methodology 4 1 vertical elevation accuracy metrics the evaluation of these global dem products impacts is presented using i statistical analysis ii river basin characteristics and iii uncertainty on streamflow based on hydrological simulations and iv impacts of cross validation for hydrological applications model evaluation is essential to measure and verify the robustness of the model moriasi et al 2007 this study used five main statistical metrics based on gupta et al 2009 and moriasi et al 2007 model evaluation guidelines for the kling gupta efficiency kge regression correlation coefficient r2 root mean square error rmse absolute mean error mae and nash sutcliffe coefficient nse the ideal kge value with kge 1 indicates perfect agreement between simulations and observations whereas a model with 0 41 kge 1 could be considered a reasonable performance gupta et al 2009 knoben et al 2019 besides the reliability of using the kling gupta efficiency kge has been shown in many recent studies for streamflow simulation acharya et al 2019 hirpa et al 2018 knoben et al 2019 usman et al 2022 as well as in the comparison with another reliable model performance metric nse clark et al 2021 knoben et al 2019 mizukami et al 2019 r2 value which varies from 0 to 1 indicates how well the simulated and observed regression lines approach an ideal match with a value of 0 indicating no correlation and a value of 1 showing that the predicted dispersion equals the measured dispersion moriasi et al 2007 the rmse is a dimension measure that shows the agreement between the observed and simulated values the rmse with the value is close to zero indicates better performance modeling moriasi et al 2007 stephanie glen 2010 the rmse values for chosen dem products show the agreement between the observed and simulated elevation values the mae measures bias with a negative or positive mae indicating underprediction or overprediction of simulated values respectively the nse ranges from to 1 showing how well the simulated and observed data match the 1 1 line regression line with slope equal to 1 an nse value of 1 indicates that the simulated and measured data are perfectly aligned while a value of zero or less than zero indicates that the observed data mean is a better predictor than the model output for this assessment we have considered that the error is larger in dem products with larger grid sizes which have been mentioned and indicated in many previous studies tan et al 2015 2018 uuemaa et al 2020 4 2 drainage density another important stream characteristic used in this study for assessments is drainage density dd which was introduced by horton 1932 the concept of this basin characteristic was defined as the eq 1 where dd is the drainage density unit of length 1 and l is the total stream length in an area of size a dingman 1978 horton 1932 1 d d l a basin according to horton 1932 dd is determined primarily by infiltration capacity and soil resistance to erosion this length of overland flow is an essential independent variable controlling the hydrologic and physiographic evolution of drainage basins horton 1932 p 284 previous studies have recognized this concept as the most commonly utilized statistic for assessing hydrological or geomorphological basin characteristics j b murphey 1977 langbein 1947 patton and baker 1976 strahler 1964 the use of drainage density in predicting streamflow characteristics that contributes to the river basin is given by eq 2 2 w 1 d d where w is the average distance between streams in a terrain of drainage density dd the average distance from divide to channel with lo known as length of overland flow was approximately described as eq 3 3 l o 1 2 d this formula is also used to explains why a basin with a higher dd has a bigger flood peak per unit area and hydrographs with shorter time bases and faster recessions would have a higher rate of direct runoff to base flow as well as a higher average runoff 4 3 catchment delineation technique the delineation procedure for chosen dem products has been performed under the same condition which is also a pre processing step for hydrological simulation in this study the 10 m reference dem was first delineated to obtain the most accurate assessment using the survey stream network and subbasin acquired from the binh dinh province sub department of environment protection soep https binhdinh eregulations org furthermore the threshold area was set to 25 km2 for the delineation with the same catchment outlet location and threshold value 300 m were set for all dem products during the swat simulations this procedure is important to maintain the stability for subbasin stream network delineation in high and low land regions between dem products and the 10 m reference dem datta et al 2022 on the other hand the survey stream network and subbasin distribution would be used only for the 10 m reference dem and set up as automatic for other dem products during the delineation process to evaluate the dems performance in different comparisons 4 4 the swat hydrological model the soil and water assessment tool swat is a semi distributed hydrological time based model time continuous which was developed and supported by the u s department of agriculture usda and agriculture research service ars arnold et al 2012 over the last decade swat has become more widely used in the united states and europe gassman et al 2007 it has become a watershed scale model that is frequently used to anticipate the impacts of lulc land use and landcover change pesticide and agricultural chemical contamination sediment yield satellite based products impacts on streamflow simulation over the various scale of catchments le et al 2020 p w gassman et al 2007 wangpimool et al 2013 zeeshan et al 2021 the first release developed for the arcgis platform was arcswat explained more in arnold et al 1998 2012 swat has been further developed for both close and open source software arcgis and qgis dile et al 2016 however in this study we used the swat version 1 1 1 developed in the new gis user interface qgis3 v3 16 to perform and assess the difference in simulated streamflow the chosen dem products were used with the same threshold and catchment outlet for delineation and the same input datasets such as climate temperature precipitation land use land cover soil types and other needed parameters see in section 3 1 a 3 year warm up period 1995 1997 was chosen over the 23 year simulation period 1998 2020 with the calibration 1998 2010 and validation 2011 2020 the model parameter calibration could affect by the uncertainties of input data abbaspour et al 2015 zhang et al 2014 so we decided not to perform any calibration within the assessment criteria part however the model calibration would be performed for specific evaluation of dems for hydrological applications in terms of streamflow simulation the model calibration and validation parameters have been extracted from the 10 m reference dem and then applied to other dem products to maintain consistency throughout the case study 4 5 land use imagery for the study was acquired from the landsat 8 usgs https www usgs gov at a resolution of 30 m x 30 m retrieved on september 15 2020 which is tallied with the chosen simulation period 1995 2020 and was used to construct the land use map fig 1c the scene was unnecessary and led to the first pre processing step with envi software subletting the image to the focus area aoi then the pre processing step was conducted to improve the image quality as was the transformation process of altering appearance explained more in envi tutorials 2000 indeed radiometric calibration atmospheric correction and pan sharpening techniques were used for better image quality the landsat image was then classified using the envi software version 4 5 with the maximum likelihood method as explained in envi tutorials 2000 and ledesma et al 1996 the procedure started with the unsupervised classification without reference observed points resulting in 30 different classes then the second stage would be conducted to identify the needed and main classes within the study area which means all common and unused classes would be combined into a single category based on the authors analysis and findings by nguyen 2013 as well as the data from the binh dinh province committee of damage response search and survey https pcttbinhdinh gov vn finally the last procedure is to use the supervised classification maximum likelihood method with the pre analysis and manual inspection resulting in four main classes crop forest crop residential area and agricultural land furthermore according to the area of lrb 1279 km2 35 surveyed points were collected in 2004 provided by the department of natural resources and environment of binh dinh province https stnmt binhdinh gov vn vi have been used to validate the classified map as a result the land use map consisting of four main classes fig 1 c with an overall accuracy of 76 is considered good to use within the study area 684 34 km2 53 51 agricultural land dominated the case study area whereas residential land was only acquired for 71 41 km2 5 37 other similar case studies have been done by deng et al 2019 for changsha city china and pervez et al 2016 for islamabad city pakistan for further information on the used techniques and methodology 4 6 soil the soil data has been retrieved using the vietnam society of soil science dataset in this case study area this dataset was constructed in 1997 with eight main soil types and 114 land units with diverse development and utilization characteristics as nguyen 2013 however only the major soil classes were presented in this study fig 1d in this case the rock class dominated over the study area with 678 89 km2 53 07 while fluvial deposits only held 25 61 km2 2 over the lrb 4 7 dem quality assessment for streamflow simulation we have used the chosen dem products as input for the swat model to simulate the main hydrological product as streamflow for the assessment we used the following model performance metrics as explained in section 4 1 kling gupta efficiency kge explained by gupta et al 2009 the correlation coefficient r2 root mean square error rmse mean error me and nash sutcliffe coefficient nse explained by moriasi et al 2007 5 results and discussion 5 1 topographic characteristics the ground control points 636 elevation points fig 1 a black points were extracted from the 10 m reference dem over the lrb and its validation is shown in section 3 2 they are then used as elevation ground control points for validating other dem products in the exact extracted coordinates categorized in high land and low land regions which would contribute to the detailed evaluation of dem characteristics in terms of elevation distribution throughout this study the seven chosen dem product elevation profile for this case study was initially presented and compared with the 10 m reference dem fig 2 in terms of maximum elevation the merit srtm 90 aster gdem2 aw3d30 and tandem x fig 2b 2e 2f 2g and 2h provided a significant difference compared to the 10 m reference dem 24 15 25 23 and 19 m respectively while the nasa and srtm 30 performed better in this evaluation the peak heights of the dem products showed a high degree of similarity and were equivalent to the 10 m reference dem 1030 m nasa 1024 m srtm 30 1024 m aw3d30 1023 m and srtm 90 1015 m fig 2 while merit tandem x 90 and aster gdem2 showed poor results with 2 33 1 84 and 2 42 difference compared to the 10 m reference dem in fact merit 1006 m and aster gdem2 1005 m showed spurious peak elevation points as the significant difference in peak height in the high land area compared to the 10 m reference dem tan et al 2018 also highlighted similar errors in their case study at the johor river basin malaysia indicating that the merit and aster gdem2 have shown a spurious peak elevation over the observed elevation data additionally hirt et al 2010 and tan et al 2018 key findings explained their similar problems for aster gdem2 which have been described as the artifacts and local inaccuracies in the aster images caused by combining stereo pair optical images and the predominance of cloud coverage tan et al 2015 2018 additionally the mismatch with the elevation peak also results from the dem resolution as it considerably impacts the dem elevation profile tan et al 2018 wu li and huang 2008 on the other hand for the lowest elevation retrieved while nasa and srtm 30 retained the best accuracy among dem products srtm 90 performed well with 1 m higher than the 10 m reference dem fig 2e the following products merit and tandem x were not performing well 8 5 m respectively compared to 10 m reference dem while aster gdem2 and aw3d30 performed worst fig 2f and 2g to begin with the detailed assessment fig 3 shows the difference in elevation over the lrb for each dem product compared to the 10 m reference dem using 30 random elevation points which would help to define the most different areas for further detailed comparison in fact the merit srtm 90 and tandem x performed the worst with the greatest difference being identified as being located in the kim son river and the lrb outlet fig 1a with the area showing more than 30 difference in elevation accounting for 588 46 km2 232 85 km2 and 434 65 km2 respectively over the total area of lrb meanwhile srtm 30 and aw3d30 performed similarly with the highest difference compared to the 10 m reference is the region located near the lrb outlet fig 3c and 3f finally the nasa dem showed a good correlation compared to the 10 m reference dem with the smallest difference fig 3b following figs 2 and 3 we use fig 4 to clarify more about the detailed comparison of the elevation values after narrowing and defining the most difference in elevation distribution among dem products indeed the lrb outlet represented as the low elevation area showed a high difference fig 3 fig 4 shows pie charts of the dem elevation values distributed among study defined ranges for further clarification as a result nasa dem and aw3d30 dem showed the best distribution with the least difference compared to the 10 m reference dem for values ranging from 0 to 30 m the aw3d30 dem with the lowest elevation of 1 m higher than the chosen elevation value range on the other hand reduced the number of elevation values used for this range assessment 0 15 m figs 2 and 4 merit nasa srtm 30 and aw3d30 showed high similarities in the 30 45 m range with a 0 06 difference from the reference dem fig 4 additionally nasa dem depicted the highest correlation with the 10 m reference dem for elevation values ranging from 60 to 75 m as well as from 105 to 120 m compared to the other dem products in the comparison for high land regions ranging from 450 to 1030 m nasa and srtm 30 90 dem products showed higher similarities with 0 18 and 0 07 compared to the 10 m reference dem respectively fig 4 table 2 shows the evaluation results of the dem elevation profile when each of the chosen dems was compared to 636 ground control points based on the slope and dem elevation profiles high land and low land regions have been determined while high land areas are primarily found near gia vuc an lao ba to hoai an vinh son vinh kim and phu my meteorological stations low land areas have been determined in the kim son river area as well as in the junction of an lao and kim son rivers fig 1a and 1b we found that the correlation is higher in the high land than in the low land region which means dem products have a smaller rmse m in the high land areas initially the srtm 30 performed the best in the high land regions followed by aster gdem2 nasa aw3d30 and tandem x table 2 besides srtm 30 and nasa outperformed the other products in low land areas while merit and srtm 90 remain the worst for both high and low land regions in this part of the study evaluation nasa and srtm 30 showed high similarities providing an intriguing subject for additional investigation fig 5 shows the vertical error elevation difference of dem products calculated for a high land and b low land regions srtm 30 and nasa performed well for the high land area followed by aster gdem2 in fact when compared to the 10 m reference dem these dem results had a high degree of similarity however nasa showed higher similarity among dem products with the highest difference within 10 compared to the 10 m reference dem whereas srtm 30 showed a larger range 11 difference fig 5a on the other hand srtm 90 aw3d30 tandem x and merit dem products have more unusual elevation points srtm 90 and aw3d30 showed that the highest and lowest elevation points differed by 20 while merit and tandem x differed by 15 compared to the 10 m reference dem fig 5a for high land areas most dem products showed high accuracy associated with a low rmse m value as shown in table 2 in general nasa and srtm 30 had a good correlation with the 10 m reference dem fig 5 b merit srtm 90 aster gdem2 and aw3d30 had a larger number of unusual elevation points the largest difference in elevation points has been recorded for these dem products fig 5b it was consistent with fig 2 when the recorded lowest elevation points m were presented as an 80 merit 100 aster gdem2 and 90 aw3d30 difference compared to the 10 m reference dem fig 2b 2f and 2g in general nasa dem performed the best among dem products in terms of low land areas a divergence was found indicating that merit and tandem x could give inconsistent results for low land regions because they show a significant underestimation of low land elevation points fig 5b in contrast aster gdem2 overestimated the actual elevation in these areas which is consistent with findings of hirt et al 2010 tan et al 2015 2018 indicating that because the artifacts and local inaccuracies in the aster images as well as the incorrect height information by combining stereo pair optical images and the predominance of cloud coverage especially in tropical areas 5 2 assessment of river network and watershed characteristics many studies have indicated that problems in the river network and sub basin re generation occur mainly in low land areas tan et al 2015 2018 xu et al 2016 in fact inadequate dem resolution would result in the loss of minor hills over low lying areas which is essential for determining the flow direction according to olivera et al 2006 and tan et al 2018 dem resolution becomes even more critical for hydrological models and in this case is the semi distributed model swat the delineation for the river networks has been done using qswat with taudem5 terrain analysis using digital elevation models v 5 3 7 published in the david tarboton hydrology research group utah state university website https hydrology usu edu taudem taudem5 indeed this digital elevation model dem tool for the extraction and analysis of hydrologic information from topography as represented by a dem has demonstrated its strong capability and suitability throughout many previous case studies fan et al 2014 tarboton et al 2009 tarboton and ames 2004 tesfa 2010 wallace et al 2007 wallis et al 2009 youn et al 2014 the delineation procedure has been mentioned with careful explanation in taudem documentation by oals 2011 due to the difference in dem resolution and technique collection as well as other important factors throughout the dem construction process we suggest conducting separated river network and watershed delineations under the same procedure setup and conditions to better reveal the nature of dem products for the delineated stream network and watershed characteristics it could help to identify which parts of the dem would be considered dangerous areas directly linked to the hazard prediction for extreme weather events such as flash floods fig 6 shows the river network derived from six dem products compared with the survey river network provided by the binh dinh province sub department of environment protection soep in general nasa aw3d30 and merit generated the closest shape of the lrb survey river network for the high land region in an lao river and the low land areas kim son river area and the area located close to the lrb outlet fig 6a and 6c the srtm 30 and 90 and tandem x indicated modest river extraction reflected by their resemblance to the survey river network however they have shown mismatches between high and low land regions in the junction part on the other hand the aster gdem2 performed worst with many failures with the river network especially in the kim son river area in the comparison of the longer river branch an lao river fig 1b which contributes primarily to the water discharge to the outlet of the lrb the nasa and aw3d30 performed well with river network lengths of 85 27 and 84 95 km respectively compared to the actual data of 85 km in contrast the merit srtm 90 and aster gdem2 over generated the an lao river length by 90 67 88 9 and 88 38 km respectively while the srtm 30 and tandem x fared poorly with lower delineated river length at 81 03 and 77 83 km respectively table 3 in the comparison of the second river kim son fig 1b and 6c southern low land region the total length of kim son river is similar among dem products ranging from 63 36 km aster gdem2 to 67 1 km merit compared to the actual length as 65 km table 3 however the aw3d30 has 70 km of river length that has been considered over generated another finding showed that the number of an lao river branches main and side branches varies significantly from 17 nasa to 26 srtm 30 except for aster gdem2 which has a lack of generated branches at 14 compared to other dem products furthermore aster gdem2 issues were found in all extraction locations showing an unstable outlet river network fig 6a and low land river network re generation fig 6b hence our findings indicated that over under generated river branches main and side branches were also associated with a mismatch in river network direction resulting in a difference in river length and is evidence for high and low land regions commonly influenced by dem resolution fig 7 and table 4 show the difference in drainage density dd km km 2 of dem products when compared to the 10 m reference dem produced under the same condition threshold technique procedure in the assessment of drainage density dd the higher dd the shorter the distance that runoff must travel via the channel and the shorter the time required for runoff to reach a channel murphey 1977 patton and baker 1976 strahler 1964 the drainage density plot dd km km2 of the eight scenarios corresponding to the chosen dem products was then shown for further discussion fig 7 table 4 in general nasa srtm 30 and aster gdem2 performed better than merit srtm 90 aw3d30 and tandem x specifically there is a minor difference between nasa srtm 30 aster gdem2 and the reference dem in high and low land areas an lao river kim son river fig 7 table 4 however these dem products performed very well in the kim son river with many familiar and unchanged parts marked as red circle also in the river junction of an lao and kim son rivers on the other hand merit srtm 90 and tandem x showed high differences in dd compared to the 10 m reference dem in both high and low land regions aw3d30 mostly showed its difference in the kim son river area fig 7 thus the better drainage density calculation would give authors a better understanding of the peak flood analysis conducted for this dem characteristic analysis in this case study the watershed delineation was performed in the same condition with the same threshold and catchment outlet as mentioned in section 4 3 watershed delineation has been identified as one of the most critical factors in assessing dem performance with implications for streamflow computation in swat chen et al 2021 nasa and aw3d30 figs 8 and 9 have shown the closest subbasin delineation to the reference number of subbasins and areas regarding subbasin characteristics indeed they have demonstrated a solid delineation with the average subbasin area for lrb being 41 04 and 40 15 km2 along with standard errors of 1 56 and 3 04 respectively when compared to the 10 m reference dem 40 69 km2 for the high and low land regions in the northern and southern lrb as well as the area close to the catchment outlet fig 8 on the other hand srtm 30 42 90 km2 and aster gdem2 42 75 km2 have shown higher errors as revealed in fig 9 most dem products except for merit srtm 90 and aster gdem2 performed well over the lrb especially in the catchment outlet low land area with a very little mismatch of delineation compared to the 10 m reference dem fig 9b besides aster gdem2 has performed remarkably poorly with many incorrect delineation points especially in creating an additional subbasin similar to merit fig 9b aster gdem2 merit and srtm 90 were considerably inaccurate for the watershed delineation for high and low land areas fig 9e 9f 9b and 9d in the middle high land regions srtm 90 provided a wildly inaccurate delineation compared to the other dem products fig 9c besides srtm 30 and aster gdem2 provided incorrect delineations in the intersection subbasin fig 9d thus this finding fulfills and re confirms the key finding mentioned in figs 3 and 5 demonstrating the other key findings of many previous studies by tan et al 2015 2018 and xu et al 2016 mentioning that failures in the river network and subbasin re generation occur mainly in low land areas merit aster gdem2 and srtm 90 delineated the western highland part of rlb incorrectly compared to the 10 m reference dem fig 9e and similarly occurred in the catchment s eastern high land region fig 9f interestingly when comparing the closed relationship dem products nasa and srtm 30 we found that these products give detected points errors similarly but srtm 30 could be realized as easy to provide inaccurate delineation in intersection subbasin especially with small size subbasins fig 9d in summary nasa and aw3d30 perform well with watershed and stream delineation showing accurate adequacy for both high and low land regions compared to other dem products which would significantly affect river characteristic re generation and streamflow simulation 5 3 topography slope and river basin characteristics the slope varies significantly between 45 21 srtm 90 and 49 85 srtm 30 compared to 47 90 10 m reference dem whereas the minimum slope remained constant at 0 the maximum slope is sensitive to dem resolution while the minimum slope is not as tan et al 2015 2018 mentioned nasa aster gdem2 and aw3d30 products have shown the nearest value of maximum slope with a difference of 1 92 1 65 and 1 50 compared with the 10 m reference dem table 5 the maximum and standard deviation sd of slope dropped as dem resolution decreased table 5 comparable to tan et al 2015 and zhang et al 2014 whose findings indicate that slope and elevation variation was related more to dem resolution variation all dem products overestimated the mean slope by 0 87 tandem x to 8 35 srtm 30 when compared to the actual value of 23 given by nguyen 2013 or under estimated by 4 13 10 m reference dem the mean elevation of the lrb was calculated in the same range in all dem products and slightly over estimated compared to the actual data of 277 m mentioned by nguyen 2013 the difference ranges from 280 55 m tandem x to 287 41 m aw3d30 the lowest difference shown with srtm 30 1 81 nasa 1 83 and tandem x 1 28 and the highest with aw3d30 3 76 table 5 in summary nasa srtm 30 and tandem x perform relatively well compared to the actual elevation and the 10 m reference dem the same delineation procedure has been given for dem products indeed the same threshold and catchment outlet location have been provided and the difference in the watershed delineation has been found and mentioned figs 8 and 9 with the number of sub basins changed unevenly table 6 it initially resulted from the difference in dem characteristics srtm 30 aw3d30 and tandem x have achieved the highest number of subbasins 33 while merit nasa srtm 90 and aster gdem2 with the number of subbasins recorded are only 31 table 6 on the other hand a difference in the number of hrus hydrologic response units has been found that varied significantly corresponding to the dem products ranging from 259 to 308 the basin area km2 varies extremely small among the dem products used which is similar to tan et al 2018 key findings that were conducted in the johor river basin 1652 km2 with minor differences compared to earthenv dem90 1648 km2 aster gdem2 1629 km2 and srtm v4 1 1642 km2 or khan et al 2014 with their findings for the upper indus basin delineation using srtm and aster gdem2 indeed the closet value 1332 64 km2 obtained by the merit dem followed by nasa dem 1332 19 km2 and the most different value 1309 67 km2 acquired with tandem x compared to the actual area at 1402 km2 nguyen 2013 and reference 10 m dem 1333 km2 table 6 indeed with the lower incidence of short range topographic changes near borders coarse dem is more suited for delineating river basins as stated by charrier and li 2012 and highlighted again by tan et al 2015 2018 5 4 dem uncertainty impacts on the catchment streamflow the seven dem products merit nasa srtm 30 srtm 90 aster gdem2 aw3d30 tandem x and the 10 m reference have been used to simulate the catchment streamflow using the semi distributed swat model with all the parameters were set as the same to ensure the consistency for the hydrological assessment then ten calibrating parameters were used with their fitted value throughout in the calibration stage are also taken into account depending on their sensitivity as explained by araza et al 2020 according to arnold et al 2012 we proposed a pre checked conceptual approach and compared the un calibrated models to observe the main hydrological outputs including surface flow groundwater flow lateral flow and peak flow most dem products performed well with chosen metrics kge r2 rmse nse and mae as shown in table 7 table 7 shows the comparison of metrics for different dem scenarios in general there is not much difference among dem products the 10 m reference dem showed the best streamflow simulation due to its high quality as a lidar product which has also been chosen by chaubey et al 2005 and lin et al 2010 2013 for their studies other dem products showed a high correlation among dem and are indicated as good kge r2 rsme nse and mae compared to the 10 m reference dem using the model evaluation guidelines section 4 1 the average monthly discharge from 1998 to 2020 is presented fig 10a in general the simulated streamflow has been found with high similarity among dem products simulations fig 10 consistent with previous studies gautam et al 2019 lin et al 2013 tan et al 2015 tran et al 2022 the streamflow is concentrated mainly in the last four months of the year during the flood season september to december with the highest discharge in november the monthly discharge peak volume is well represented across the dem products ranging from 269 m3 s to 273 m3 s compared to the streamflow of the reference dem at 275 m3 s furthermore when considering the last four months wet season and the first eight months dry season nasa srtm 30 aster gdem2 and aw3d30 provided the best simulation compared to other dem products and observed streamflow fig 10d there is a high correlation for annual simulated streamflow amongst dem products and the reference dem with the average of yearly discharge at 73 69 m3 s reference dem followed by nasa 74 54 m3 s tandem x 74 65 m3 s srtm 90 74 79 m3 s whereas the simulated streamflow is approximately the same for srtm 90 aster gdem2 and aw3d30 fig 10b furthermore during the 23 year simulation period 1998 2020 most dem products showed similar simulations with flood peaks fig 10c which was confirmed by a comparison between the drainage density of the reference dem and other dem products as presented and explained in fig 7 and table 4 however we found that the tandem x 90 m showed very high similarity in terms of flood peak simulation compared to the 10 m reference dem and other dem products after calibrating with the reference dem s calibrating fitted values indeed the calibrated streamflow of tandem x shows a range of 4 1 37 difference m3 s compared to the reference dem while other dem products show higher differences ranging from 9 to 61 another surprising key finding is that the two close relationship products nasa and srtm dems show good performance better than tandem x in terms of simulated flood peak as well as streamflow simulation table 7 before calibrating and they become significantly less accurate after calibration to confirm it we decided to perform some more scenarios for testing the tandem x and srtm 90 s ability during the calibration same resolution of 90 m then the calibrating parameter fitted values from other different dem resolutions 10 30 m have been applied and the results were shown in fig 11 the calibration of tandem x 90 m using the calibrating fitted values from the 10 m reference dem showed a smaller difference in simulated flood peak fig 11 b than other higher resolution 30 m dem products nasa srtm 30 aw3d30 and aster gdem2 compared to the reference dem in terms of flood peak it thus questioned us the reason for the inconsistent impacts between dem resolutions to the captured flood peak to understand it some scenarios for the streamflow observation have been suggested to conduct using the two 90 m dem products srtm and tandem x the results indicated that the srtm 90 m showed slightly less accuracy in flood peak simulation when calibrated by the coarser dem s 30 m calibrating fitted values fig 11a however this finding is not consistent in the case of using tandem x 90 m when the coarser dem s 30 m calibrating fitted values showed a significantly estimate the flood peak compared to the 10 m reference dem fig 11b furthermore our key finding showed that the least difference could be found if the validated dem has the exact resolution as the dem product used for calibrating as shown in fig 11 throughout these scenarios our study revealed that the best hydrological simulation could be achieved by using the same resolution dem in the calibration and validation of other dem products besides an assumption has been made indicating the reason why tandem x 90 m showed good flood peak simulation which might come from the suitability of the chosen parameters during the calibration and validation part however it might be the particular characteristic of tandem x among other chosen dem products which could be useful as an initial finding to study more about this dem product due to its potential capability to use in terms of hydrological application if it is validated by using suitable calibrating parameters extracted from an appropriate resolution dem in this case is the 30 m resolution the surface runoff and streamflow calculations within the dem products are similar in terms of streamflow tendency and volume monthly and annual highlighting that swat simulated streamflow did not vary significantly between the different dem scenarios which was expected as the curve number cn used by swat to simulate surface runoff does not consider topography which is consistent with the findings of tan et al 2015 2018 in the kelantan river basin malaysia and sharma and tiwari 2014 with lower dem resolution 90 m merit srtm 90 and tandem x are under simulated both monthly and annual discharge due to the loss of topographical information previously explained by hirt et al 2010 and tan et al 2015 2018 in addition the difference in watershed scale and smoothening of the slope indicates that streamflow is more sensitive to dem resolution contradicting findings from lin et al 2013 and zhang et al 2014 but consistent with chaubey et al 2005 gautam et al 2019 and tan et al 2015 2018 on the other hand the dem topography information does not appear to significantly impact the primary additional hydrological results such as surface runoff groundwater flow precipitation water percolation water yield deep aquifer recharge potential evapotranspiration and sediment yield table 8 which was explained as the curve number cn used by swat to simulate surface runoff does not consider topography it is then consistent with the findings of prior case studies by lin et al 2013 tan et al 2015 2018 and zhang et al 2014 according to the actual values from nguyen 2013 the estimated precipitation table 8 derived using dem products differs by 10 from the actual precipitation at 2460 mm year the dem evapotranspiration revealed comparable records with differences ranging from 3 to 7 compared to the observed 630 mm year and within a 6 variation compared to 1830 mm year of water yield table 8 however the lateral flow appears to be more affected than other hydrological components as it varies considerably based on the dem resolution 10 m 30 m and 90 m table 8 sloan and moore 1984 have explained their findings in the kinematic storage model which was again emphasized and highlighted not only once but also in the case study of tan et al 2018 and more thoroughly in swat documentation written by neitsch et al 2011 as the drop in mean slopes with coarser dem resolutions leading to the considerable change in lateral flow furthermore carlston 1963 found that when drainage density increases baseflow discharge into a stream decrease for a given basin due to less infiltration to contribute to baseflow then more water entering the drainage basin soon following a rainfall event departs quickly through streams and does not infiltrate to contribute to baseflow discharge thus surface flow surq is comparable across dem products while lateral flow latq differs between dem resolutions 10 30 and 90 m the difference in the estimation of groundwater has been observed between the finest used dem reference 10 m and other dem products 30 m and 90 m because each grid cell in the dem uses the mean value of the entire square discretized area as elevation value finer resolutions lead to a higher level of accuracy in water balance estimation resulting in a more accurate simulation consistent with the results of borz√¨ et al 2020 with their case study in the alcantara river basin italy as a consequence when compared to other dem products nasa 30 m was ranked as the most suitable dem product for lrb followed by srtm 30 30 m which could imply satisfactory outcomes as a first step to be used in part for other locations in central vietnam they performed well in terms of basin and stream delineation demonstrating similarities in characteristics of catchment streamflow when compared to the 10 m reference dem and actual data provided by nguyen 2013 binh dinh province sub department of environment protection soep and vietnam institute of geosciences and mineral resources vigmr furthermore they have given good values for hydrological properties discharge peak flood or similarities in the additional hydrological products in dry and wet seasons 5 5 streamflow performance validation using cross validation one of the critical tasks to have a good result in terms of hydrological application is validation which has been mentioned with its importance and impact on the simulation of main hydrological products falorni et al 2005 gyamfi et al 2016 hosseini and khaleghi 2020 khakbaz et al 2012 refsgaard 1997 uuemaa et al 2020 in this study all of the inputs were set under the same conditions over the chosen simulation period the validation of dem performance after the calibration step is essential to reveal the authors suggested choosing the 10 m reference dem and the nasa dem 30 m to perform the cross validation due to their resolution and good performance through the streamflow simulation section 5 4 the results are shown in table 9 and fig 12 we found that the best performance of streamflow and flood peak simulations in terms of runoff volume and trend would be achieved if the calibration and validation were performed for the same dem table 1 the higher performances with higher values of r2 rmse nse mae and kge for flood peak estimation through dem products after validation using different sets of calibrating fitted value parameters have been shown in table 9 and fig 12 when validating a lower resolution dem i e 30 m nasa dem using the calibrating parameters of the higher resolution dem 10 m reference dem the simulated streamflow trend and volume have a high correlation compared to them in the case the calibration and validation were performed for the same dem product table 9 fig 12b however when the validation has been reverted which means the higher resolution dem i e 10 m reference dem validated by the lower resolution dem i e 30 m nasa dem the streamflow trend volume becomes less accurate 40 with performance metrics compared to the un calibrated model and there was a significant underestimate of the flood peak over the simulation period fig 12a 6 limitations and further studies we acknowledge the study s constraint is that it could only focus on a single watershed for revealing investigation of the chosen dems performances our most significant challenge is collecting the reference dem which must comply strictly with country standards and authorities regarding collection technique product calibration and validation thus for future studies we would like to collect more high resolution dem product to perform the assessment for entire vietnam which would be useful for other neighboring regions 7 conclusions the comprehensive assessment framework and implementation of the swat model were used to investigate the relevance of the most recent global resolution and freely accessible space borne dem products using hydrological models in central vietnam this study used the reference dem 10 m to assess the other dem products quality merit nasa srtm aster gdem2 aw3d30 and tandem x with the chosen resolutions 30 m and 90 m four designed criteria for assessment were used i statistical analysis ii river basin characteristics iii the dem uncertainty on streamflow simulation and iv cross validation s impacts on the hydrological application as a result nasa 30 m and srtm 30 30 m dem products were determined to be the most accurate of the chosen dem products whereas aster gdem2 30 m merit 90 m and srtm 90 m are the less accurate in this study srtm 30 is slightly better than nasa in high land regions but not in the low land areas in terms of elevation retrieved and subbasin and river network delineations merit tandem x and aster gdem2 performed poorly with 2 30 1 83 and 2 04 mismatch in peak elevation m respectively on the other hand nasa aw3d30 and merit produced the closest shape to the lrb survey river network with high land regions in the an lao river or low land parts area of kim son river and close to the lrb outlet srtm 30 srtm 90 and tandem x indicated modest river extraction due to their resemblance to the survey river network but have a mismatched delineation in the connection part between high and low land regions although the merit srtm 90 and aster gdem2 over generated the an lao river length the srtm 30 and tandem x produced an inadequate result with shorter river lengths and only nasa and aw3d30 performed well with river network lengths that were similar to the survey river network although kge and other model performance metrics r2 nse rmse mae cannot be directly compared and should not be treated as approximately equivalent clark et al 2021 knoben et al 2019 mizukami et al 2019 our study has revealed its high reliability to calculate the uncertainty of flood peak estimation which has been noticed in this study for other further case studies nasa and aw3d30 showed the most accurate subbasin delineation number of subbasins and area while srtm 30 highlighted errors for intersection subbasin delineation especially for small size subbasins srtm 30 and aster gdem2 have also given inaccurate delineations in the narrowed subbasin borders in the kim son river area furthermore compared to the 10 m reference dem product merit aster gdem2 and srtm 90 were identified as showing many errors in the western high land portion of rlb and the same result occurred for these three dem products in the eastern high land region for streamflow analysis except for lateral flow groundwater flow water percolation and sediment yield the dem resolution and source had little effect on most of other hydrological components this study showed that streamflow is concentrated mainly during the flood season with a peak in november and higher dem resolution produces better streamflow simulation results this study has thoroughly evaluated the performance of nasa and other chosen dem products such as merit srtm aster gdem2 aw3d30 and tandem x in a wide ranging comparison these primary findings presented a good approach for revealing comprehensive dem product analysis which could be used as a reference for other vietnamese case studies to understand better the impacts of dem input to simulate streamflow and basin characteristics this work fulfilled previous work on hydrological modeling and decision making in the lower mekong river basin mohammed et al 2018a b c where an improved digital elevation model would be quite helpful in understanding the surface and subsurface routing of water finally this study s key findings help regional decision makers and stakeholders plan for future water resource management issues and contribute to the current literature that uses physically based hydrological models to investigate the implications of the digital elevation model dem fidelity on hydrologic simulations around the world credit authorship contribution statement thanh nhan duc tran conceptualization

7752,study region lai giang river basin central vietnam study focus the digital elevation models dem is essential in hydrological modeling and water cycle understanding there are several unanswered questions regarding the impact of dem on the models quality of hydrological applications this study develops a comprehensive framework for evaluating impacts of six global dem products merit nasa srtm aster gdem2 aw3d30 and tandem x using the semi distributed model swat for the lai giang river basin central vietnam in which four criteria have been used i statistical analysis ii river basin characteristics iii effects of dem uncertainty on streamflow using hydrological simulations and iv cross validation s impacts on hydrological applications new hydrological insights for the regions 1 nasa and srtm 30 dem were ranked as most accurate dems among the chosen products 2 aster gdem2 performed the worst with more uncertainty in river networks delineation 3 merit aster gdem2 and srtm 90 m provided inaccurate basin delineations particularly for the intersection subbasin 4 dem resolution and source are insensitive to most of the hydrological components except for lateral flow groundwater flow water percolation and sediment yield moreover a proposed cross validation approach for the dem performance has been introduced showing that the calibrating parameters of higher resolution dem would positively impact the hydrological simulations of lower resolution dems and the opposite especially in terms of flood peak observation keywords digital elevation model dem merit nasa srtm aster gdem2 aw3d30 tandem x swat lai giang river basin vietnam data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction the digital elevation model dem due to advancements in computer and satellite technology has contributed significantly to the accuracy of most hydrological models lin et al 2010 2013 rocha et al 2020 tan et al 2015 tran et al 2022 dem is a critical geographic input for hydrological models that define main basin characteristics such as sub basins and river networks for example blanchard et al 2010 and bourdin et al 2012 mentioned the importance of dem input for hydrological models due to its representation of watershed topography furthermore many other studies such as gautam et al 2019 lin et al 2013 tan et al 2018 have then followed to progressively reveal the accuracy of dem input which is critical and can be used to assess the dependability of the generated hydrologic and topographic features however due to the uncertainty of many factors source resolution collection techniques and calibration methods this critical input might impact the results of numerical models considerably either positively or negatively gonga saholiariliva et al 2011 wechsler 2007 for new dem products it is necessary to determine the uncertainty of them which has become an essential topic for hydrological applications uuemaa et al 2020 several previous studies by gonga saholiariliva et al 2011 hawker et al 2019 tan et al 2015 2018 uuemaa et al 2020 and xuan hong et al 2022 have focused on finding a optimal methodology to understand and assess the differences of dem products li and wong 2010 have conducted the similar assessment with the use of different resolutions and sources of several dem products additionally lin et al 2013 and zhang et al 2014 have also assessed the combination of different dem resolutions and sources to understand dem related uncertainties further their key findings exhibited that with different dems the extraction delineation of catchment sub basins river networks streamflow simulation flood peak and total runoff volume would be impacted in recent years tan et al 2015 and zeeshan et al 2021 also confirmed that the dem resolutions and sources affect streamflow simulation in hydrological models such as swat soil water assessment tool model thus in this study we aim to quantify the uncertainty and reliability of several dems utilized in a single objective study area in this case the lai giang river basin central vietnam these following dem products were chosen based on their availability for the chosen study area as well as the need to have a better understanding 1 multi error removed improved terrain dem merit 2 nasadem nasa 3 shuttle radar topography mission srtm 4 the terra advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer aster global digital elevation model gdem version 2 aster gdem2 5 alos global digital surface model aw3d30 and 6 terrasar x add on for digital elevation measurements tandem x these dem products have been partially revealed by crippen et al 2016 gonz√°lez et al 2020 pham et al 2018 xu et al 2016 yamazaki et al 2017 and zeeshan et al 2021 but in separated works this study aims to evaluate the chosen dem products using a comprehensive assessment same assessment using hydrological model to reduce the uncertainties and better understand them which has been revealed but in separated works charrier et al 2012 crippen et al 2016 gonga saholiariliva et al 2011 hawker et al 2019 hirt et al 2010 li and wong 2010 takaku et al 2020 tan et al 2015 2018 tucker et al 2001 uuemaa et al 2020 wechsler 2007 xu et al 2016 yamazaki et al 2017 additionally these studies have provided good and valuable insights however a more robust comparison is possible using the single case study of a same study area in this study we would then investigate the dem products performance using a comprehensive assessment and assess the hydrological applications of them in a central vietnam basin which has not been studied before the nasa dem a near global elevation project introduced by thoroughly reprocessing shuttle radar topography mission srtm was publicly released in february 2020 for assessment and use crippen et al 2016 uuemaa et al 2020 the limitation of the number of studies regarding the performance and capability of this new dem in terms of hydrological application is skeptical especially for asia h li et al 2022 have recently revealed the assessment for nasa and aw3d30 in which they concluded that aw3d30 showed better vertical accuracy compared to nasa dem however two constraints of their study should be considered 1 some areas are highly covered by dynamic natures i e snow and ice water body and wetland as well as urban areas i e artificial surfaces and 2 hydrological applications i e streamflow flood peak have not been performed additionally we have no understanding how this newly released dem perform in vietnam and to demonstrate its competence and appropriate application for case studies in different regions is an interesting topic besides due to the complex of vietnam terrain profile there is a rising need to have an accurate hydrological monitoring and forecasting that are critical for proper water resources management however most previous studies assessing dems have been conducted outside of vietnam territory these reasons have encouraged us to conduct this study in which we would focus on i having a general and comprehensive assessments for commonly used dem products ii increase understanding and verify previous studies key findings addressing the nasa dem product s performance under a comparison to other dems and compare it with its original version srtm dem iii revealing the accuracy of this product for vietnam related studies in this case is a basin in central vietnam this study would focus on the lai giang river basin central vietnam which has a complex terrain profile and significant elevation changes nguyen 2013 our methodology would consider the river basin characteristics and the uncertainty impacts of dem products on the simulated streamflow using a hydrological model these key findings contribute to understanding how nasa dem and other dems could be used for the lai giang river basin or central vietnam in general under a comprehensive comparison of chosen dem products supporting regional decision makers and stakeholders plans for hydrological related issues moreover a new cross validation approach to validate quality of dem products used for hydrological applications has been proposed and performed it would then show how the calibration procedure impacts the performance of dems in terms of the hydrological related applications 2 study area the lai giang river basin lrb is the second largest watershed in binh dinh province central vietnam with a total area of approximately 1279 km2 fig 1 and geographic coordinates ranging from 14o10 to 14o45 north latitude and 108o44 to 109o10 east longitude nguyen 2013 the lrb is formed by the confluence of two rivers an lao and kim son which join at the border between the hoai an and hoai nhon districts fig 1 b the kim son river is located in hoai an district binh dinh province which is around 65 kilometers long with a basin area of approximately 575 kilometers whereas the an lao river is about 85 kilometers long with a basin area of roughly 697 kilometers lrb is in a mountainous region with low hills occupying more than 80 of the lrb the average height of this basin is around 500 m as low as 40 m and the maximum height is approximately 1200 m on the western side the average slope of the basin is around 23 and less than 0 25 along the mountain

that has been produced by the vietnam institute of geoscience and mineral resources http www vigmr vn using aerial photos between 2012 and 2017 the making of dem strictly followed the decision 5 2005 qd btnmt monre 2005 dated december 13th 2005 which provides technical regulations for making topographic maps at scales 1 2000 1 10000 1 25000 and 1 50000 using digital imaging technology uav and aerial photo with further updates in 2008 monre 2008 the vertical accuracy of this product is 3 3 m in the mountainous region and 1 7 m in the flat terrain areas merit dem multi error removed improved terrain dem is a high accuracy 90 m resolutions dem that is freely available to the public mentioned first in yamazaki et al 2017 2019 according to xu et al 2016 this product was produced by eliminating significant errors from jaxa aw3d dem viewfinder panoramas dem and srtm 30 dem the merit dem product isolates noises stripe speckle or bias absolute tree height using filtering methods and satellite datasets the land regions would be mapped with a vertical precision of at least 2 m increasing vertical accuracy from 39 to 58 xu et al 2016 thus when height mistakes outnumber topographical variations the quality of flat regions improves considerably and river networks are depicted furthermore the vertical accuracy of merit is 12 m global with further detailed explanation by yamazaki et

been improved by using auxiliary data from various datasets with 1 spatial resolution aster gdem prism glas and icesat approximately 30 m on the equator uuemaa et al 2020 since nasa dem is relatively new compared to other free and widely available dem products its vertical accuracy has been revealed as 5 3 m united states buckley et al 2020 and 6 59 m china h li et al 2022 srtm dem shuttle radar topography mission dem was released by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa collaborating with national geospatial intelligence agency nga this dem was generated using images captured by two radars on space shuttle endeavour to build a near global 80 dem rabus et al 2003 tan et al 2018 the dataset of srtm dem for non us countries was initially only available at a resolution of 90 m 3 arc resolution and the dataset for srtm dem with the 30 m resolution was released for southeast asia in 2015 the srtm 30 was created based on c band radar interferometry data with a reported accuracy of 16 m hennig et al 2001 however in mountain regions vertical accuracy is 9 m global rodr√≠guez et al 2006 or 4 31 m 14 09 m poland kolecka and kozak 2014 aster dem the terra advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer was released by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa in collaboration with the japan ministry of economic trade and industry meti it was produced using the aster stereoscopic data collected by two telescopes on the terra satellite tachikawa et al 2011 the first version of aster gdem 2009 was reported to contain artifact problems dewitt et al 2015 however an improved version of it was released in 2011 with the same resolution of 30 m it has improved over the original version v1 in geo referencing including more scenes gathered between 2008 and 2011 with a smaller correlation kernel and higher spatial resolution tachikawa et al 2011 this dem product has been chosen to use in this study detailed descriptions and findings of this dem product from previous studies could be found in gesch et al 2014 gonz√°lez et al 2020 and aster gdem validation team 2011 with the vertical accuracy below 12 m

accuracy has been determined around 5 m global takaku et al 2020 uuemaa et al 2020 tandem x dem terrasar x add on for digital elevation measurements is the product of a collaboration between the german aerospace center dlr and airbus defense space ads it was built using interferometric synthetic aperture radar insar collected by radar satellites terrasar x and tandem x with a total working lifespan of around 4 5 years in late 2018 the entirely free global product tandem x dem v1 0 with 90 m spatial resolution was published hawker et al 2019 and the vertical error has been determined to be approximately less than 10 m wessel 2016 the summary of dem product information used in this study is presented in table 1 4 methodology 4 1 vertical elevation accuracy metrics the evaluation of these global dem products impacts is presented using i statistical analysis ii river basin characteristics and iii uncertainty on streamflow based on hydrological simulations and iv impacts of cross validation for hydrological applications model evaluation is essential to measure and verify the robustness of the model moriasi et al 2007 this study used five main statistical metrics based on gupta et al 2009 and moriasi et al 2007 model evaluation guidelines for the kling gupta efficiency kge regression correlation coefficient r2 root mean square error rmse absolute mean error mae and nash sutcliffe coefficient nse the ideal kge value with kge 1 indicates perfect agreement between simulations and observations whereas a model with 0 41 kge 1 could be considered a reasonable performance gupta et al 2009 knoben et al 2019 besides the reliability of using the kling gupta efficiency kge has been shown in many recent studies for streamflow simulation acharya et al 2019 hirpa et al 2018 knoben et al 2019 usman et al 2022 as well as in the comparison with another reliable model performance metric nse clark et al 2021 knoben et al 2019 mizukami et al 2019 r2 value which varies from 0 to 1 indicates how well the simulated and observed regression lines approach an ideal match with a value of 0 indicating no correlation and a value of 1 showing that the predicted dispersion equals the measured dispersion moriasi et al 2007 the rmse is a dimension measure that shows the agreement between the observed and simulated values the rmse with the value is close to zero indicates better performance modeling moriasi et al 2007 stephanie glen 2010 the rmse values for chosen dem products show the agreement between the observed and simulated elevation values the mae measures bias with a negative or positive mae indicating underprediction or overprediction of simulated values respectively the nse ranges from to 1 showing how well the simulated and observed data match the 1 1 line regression line with slope equal to 1 an nse value of 1 indicates that the simulated and measured data are perfectly aligned while a value of zero or less than zero indicates that the observed data mean is a better predictor than the model output for this assessment we have considered that the error is larger in dem products with larger grid sizes which have been mentioned and indicated in many previous studies tan et al 2015 2018 uuemaa et al 2020 4 2 drainage density another important stream characteristic used in this study for assessments is drainage density dd which was introduced by horton 1932 the concept of this basin characteristic was defined as the eq 1 where dd is the drainage density unit of length 1 and l is the total stream length in an area of size a dingman 1978 horton 1932 1 d d l a basin according to horton 1932 dd is determined primarily by infiltration capacity and soil resistance to erosion this length of overland flow is an essential independent variable controlling the hydrologic and physiographic evolution of drainage basins horton 1932 p 284 previous studies have recognized this concept as the most commonly utilized statistic for assessing hydrological or geomorphological basin characteristics j b murphey 1977 langbein 1947 patton and baker 1976 strahler 1964 the use of drainage density in predicting streamflow characteristics that contributes to the river basin is given by eq 2 2 w 1 d d where w is the average distance between streams in a terrain of drainage density dd the average distance from divide to channel with lo known as length of overland flow was approximately described as eq 3 3 l o 1 2 d this formula is also used to explains why a basin with a higher dd has a bigger flood peak per unit area and hydrographs with shorter time bases and faster recessions would have a higher rate of direct runoff to base flow as well as a higher average runoff 4 3 catchment delineation technique the delineation procedure for chosen dem products has been performed under the same condition which is also a pre processing step for hydrological simulation in this study the 10 m reference dem was first delineated to obtain the most accurate assessment using the survey stream network and subbasin acquired from the binh dinh province sub department of environment protection soep https binhdinh eregulations org furthermore the threshold area was set to 25 km2 for the delineation with the same catchment outlet location and threshold value 300 m were set for all dem products during the swat simulations this procedure is important to maintain the stability for subbasin stream network delineation in high and low land regions between dem products and the 10 m reference dem datta et al 2022 on the other hand the survey stream network and subbasin distribution would be used only for the 10 m reference dem and set up as automatic for other dem products during the delineation process to evaluate the dems performance in different comparisons 4 4 the swat hydrological model the soil and water assessment tool swat is a semi distributed hydrological time based model time continuous which was developed and supported by the u s department of agriculture usda and agriculture research service ars arnold et al 2012 over the last decade swat has become more widely used in the united states and europe gassman et al 2007 it has become a watershed scale model that is frequently used to anticipate the impacts of lulc land use and landcover change pesticide and agricultural chemical contamination sediment yield satellite based products impacts on streamflow simulation over the various scale of catchments le et al 2020 p w gassman et al 2007 wangpimool et al 2013 zeeshan et al 2021 the first release developed for the arcgis platform was arcswat explained more in arnold et al 1998 2012 swat has been further developed for both close and open source software arcgis and qgis dile et al 2016 however in this study we used the swat version 1 1 1 developed in the new gis user interface qgis3 v3 16 to perform and assess the difference in simulated streamflow the chosen dem products were used with the same threshold and catchment outlet for delineation and the same input datasets such as climate temperature precipitation land use land cover soil types and other needed parameters see in section 3 1 a 3 year warm up period 1995 1997 was chosen over the 23 year simulation period 1998 2020 with the calibration 1998 2010 and validation 2011 2020 the model parameter calibration could affect by the uncertainties of input data abbaspour et al 2015 zhang et al 2014 so we decided not to perform any calibration within the assessment criteria part however the model calibration would be performed for specific evaluation of dems for hydrological applications in terms of streamflow simulation the model calibration and validation parameters have been extracted from the 10 m reference dem and then applied to other dem products to maintain consistency throughout the case study 4 5 land use imagery for the study was acquired from the landsat 8 usgs https www usgs gov at a resolution of 30 m x 30 m retrieved on september 15 2020 which is tallied with the chosen simulation period 1995 2020 and was used to construct the land use map fig 1c the scene was unnecessary and led to the first pre processing step with envi software subletting the image to the focus area aoi then the pre processing step was conducted to improve the image quality as was the transformation process of altering appearance explained more in envi tutorials 2000 indeed radiometric calibration atmospheric correction and pan sharpening techniques were used for better image quality the landsat image was then classified using the envi software version 4 5 with the maximum likelihood method as explained in envi tutorials 2000 and ledesma et al 1996 the procedure started with the unsupervised classification without reference observed points resulting in 30 different classes then the second stage would be conducted to identify the needed and main classes within the study area which means all common and unused classes would be combined into a single category based on the authors analysis and findings by nguyen 2013 as well as the data from the binh dinh province committee of damage response search and survey https pcttbinhdinh gov vn finally the last procedure is to use the supervised classification maximum likelihood method with the pre analysis and manual inspection resulting in four main classes crop forest crop residential area and agricultural land furthermore according to the area of lrb 1279 km2 35 surveyed points were collected in 2004 provided by the department of natural resources and environment of binh dinh province https stnmt binhdinh gov vn vi have been used to validate the classified map as a result the land use map consisting of four main classes fig 1 c with an overall accuracy of 76 is considered good to use within the study area 684 34 km2 53 51 agricultural land dominated the case study area whereas residential land was only acquired for 71 41 km2 5 37 other similar case studies have been done by deng et al 2019 for changsha city china and pervez et al 2016 for islamabad city pakistan for further information on the used techniques and methodology 4 6 soil the soil data has been retrieved using the vietnam society of soil science dataset in this case study area this dataset was constructed in 1997 with eight main soil types and 114 land units with diverse development and utilization characteristics as nguyen 2013 however only the major soil classes were presented in this study fig 1d in this case the rock class dominated over the study area with 678 89 km2 53 07 while fluvial deposits only held 25 61 km2 2 over the lrb 4 7 dem quality assessment for streamflow simulation we have used the chosen dem products as input for the swat model to simulate the main hydrological product as streamflow for the assessment we used the following model performance metrics as explained in section 4 1 kling gupta efficiency kge explained by gupta et al 2009 the correlation coefficient r2 root mean square error rmse mean error me and nash sutcliffe coefficient nse explained by moriasi et al 2007 5 results and discussion 5 1 topographic characteristics the ground control points 636 elevation points fig 1 a black points were extracted from the 10 m reference dem over the lrb and its validation is shown in section 3 2 they are then used as elevation ground control points for validating other dem products in the exact extracted coordinates categorized in high land and low land regions which would contribute to the detailed evaluation of dem characteristics in terms of elevation distribution throughout this study the seven chosen dem product elevation profile for this case study was initially presented and compared with the 10 m reference dem fig 2 in terms of maximum elevation the merit srtm 90 aster gdem2 aw3d30 and tandem x fig 2b 2e 2f 2g and 2h provided a significant difference compared to the 10 m reference dem 24 15 25 23 and 19 m respectively while the nasa and srtm 30 performed better in this evaluation the peak heights of the dem products showed a high degree of similarity and were equivalent to the 10 m reference dem 1030 m nasa 1024 m srtm 30 1024 m aw3d30 1023 m and srtm 90 1015 m fig 2 while merit tandem x 90 and aster gdem2 showed poor results with 2 33 1 84 and 2 42 difference compared to the 10 m reference dem in fact merit 1006 m and aster gdem2 1005 m showed spurious peak elevation points as the significant difference in peak height in the high land area compared to the 10 m reference dem tan et al 2018 also highlighted similar errors in their case study at the johor river basin malaysia indicating that the merit and aster gdem2 have shown a spurious peak elevation over the observed elevation data additionally hirt et al 2010 and tan et al 2018 key findings explained their similar problems for aster gdem2 which have been described as the artifacts and local inaccuracies in the aster images caused by combining stereo pair optical images and the predominance of cloud coverage tan et al 2015 2018 additionally the mismatch with the elevation peak also results from the dem resolution as it considerably impacts the dem elevation profile tan et al 2018 wu li and huang 2008 on the other hand for the lowest elevation retrieved while nasa and srtm 30 retained the best accuracy among dem products srtm 90 performed well with 1 m higher than the 10 m reference dem fig 2e the following products merit and tandem x were not performing well 8 5 m respectively compared to 10 m reference dem while aster gdem2 and aw3d30 performed worst fig 2f and 2g to begin with the detailed assessment fig 3 shows the difference in elevation over the lrb for each dem product compared to the 10 m reference dem using 30 random elevation points which would help to define the most different areas for further detailed comparison in fact the merit srtm 90 and tandem x performed the worst with the greatest difference being identified as being located in the kim son river and the lrb outlet fig 1a with the area showing more than 30 difference in elevation accounting for 588 46 km2 232 85 km2 and 434 65 km2 respectively over the total area of lrb meanwhile srtm 30 and aw3d30 performed similarly with the highest difference compared to the 10 m reference is the region located near the lrb outlet fig 3c and 3f finally the nasa dem showed a good correlation compared to the 10 m reference dem with the smallest difference fig 3b following figs 2 and 3 we use fig 4 to clarify more about the detailed comparison of the elevation values after narrowing and defining the most difference in elevation distribution among dem products indeed the lrb outlet represented as the low elevation area showed a high difference fig 3 fig 4 shows pie charts of the dem elevation values distributed among study defined ranges for further clarification as a result nasa dem and aw3d30 dem showed the best distribution with the least difference compared to the 10 m reference dem for values ranging from 0 to 30 m the aw3d30 dem with the lowest elevation of 1 m higher than the chosen elevation value range on the other hand reduced the number of elevation values used for this range assessment 0 15 m figs 2 and 4 merit nasa srtm 30 and aw3d30 showed high similarities in the 30 45 m range with a 0 06 difference from the reference dem fig 4 additionally nasa dem depicted the highest correlation with the 10 m reference dem for elevation values ranging from 60 to 75 m as well as from 105 to 120 m compared to the other dem products in the comparison for high land regions ranging from 450 to 1030 m nasa and srtm 30 90 dem products showed higher similarities with 0 18 and 0 07 compared to the 10 m reference dem respectively fig 4 table 2 shows the evaluation results of the dem elevation profile when each of the chosen dems was compared to 636 ground control points based on the slope and dem elevation profiles high land and low land regions have been determined while high land areas are primarily found near gia vuc an lao ba to hoai an vinh son vinh kim and phu my meteorological stations low land areas have been determined in the kim son river area as well as in the junction of an lao and kim son rivers fig 1a and 1b we found that the correlation is higher in the high land than in the low land region which means dem products have a smaller rmse m in the high land areas initially the srtm 30 performed the best in the high land regions followed by aster gdem2 nasa aw3d30 and tandem x table 2 besides srtm 30 and nasa outperformed the other products in low land areas while merit and srtm 90 remain the worst for both high and low land regions in this part of the study evaluation nasa and srtm 30 showed high similarities providing an intriguing subject for additional investigation fig 5 shows the vertical error elevation difference of dem products calculated for a high land and b low land regions srtm 30 and nasa performed well for the high land area followed by aster gdem2 in fact when compared to the 10 m reference dem these dem results had a high degree of similarity however nasa showed higher similarity among dem products with the highest difference within 10 compared to the 10 m reference dem whereas srtm 30 showed a larger range 11 difference fig 5a on the other hand srtm 90 aw3d30 tandem x and merit dem products have more unusual elevation points srtm 90 and aw3d30 showed that the highest and lowest elevation points differed by 20 while merit and tandem x differed by 15 compared to the 10 m reference dem fig 5a for high land areas most dem products showed high accuracy associated with a low rmse m value as shown in table 2 in general nasa and srtm 30 had a good correlation with the 10 m reference dem fig 5 b merit srtm 90 aster gdem2 and aw3d30 had a larger number of unusual elevation points the largest difference in elevation points has been recorded for these dem products fig 5b it was consistent with fig 2 when the recorded lowest elevation points m were presented as an 80 merit 100 aster gdem2 and 90 aw3d30 difference compared to the 10 m reference dem fig 2b 2f and 2g in general nasa dem performed the best among dem products in terms of low land areas a divergence was found indicating that merit and tandem x could give inconsistent results for low land regions because they show a significant underestimation of low land elevation points fig 5b in contrast aster gdem2 overestimated the actual elevation in these areas which is consistent with findings of hirt et al 2010 tan et al 2015 2018 indicating that because the artifacts and local inaccuracies in the aster images as well as the incorrect height information by combining stereo pair optical images and the predominance of cloud coverage especially in tropical areas 5 2 assessment of river network and watershed characteristics many studies have indicated that problems in the river network and sub basin re generation occur mainly in low land areas tan et al 2015 2018 xu et al 2016 in fact inadequate dem resolution would result in the loss of minor hills over low lying areas which is essential for determining the flow direction according to olivera et al 2006 and tan et al 2018 dem resolution becomes even more critical for hydrological models and in this case is the semi distributed model swat the delineation for the river networks has been done using qswat with taudem5 terrain analysis using digital elevation models v 5 3 7 published in the david tarboton hydrology research group utah state university website https hydrology usu edu taudem taudem5 indeed this digital elevation model dem tool for the extraction and analysis of hydrologic information from topography as represented by a dem has demonstrated its strong capability and suitability throughout many previous case studies fan et al 2014 tarboton et al 2009 tarboton and ames 2004 tesfa 2010 wallace et al 2007 wallis et al 2009 youn et al 2014 the delineation procedure has been mentioned with careful explanation in taudem documentation by oals 2011 due to the difference in dem resolution and technique collection as well as other important factors throughout the dem construction process we suggest conducting separated river network and watershed delineations under the same procedure setup and conditions to better reveal the nature of dem products for the delineated stream network and watershed characteristics it could help to identify which parts of the dem would be considered dangerous areas directly linked to the hazard prediction for extreme weather events such as flash floods fig 6 shows the river network derived from six dem products compared with the survey river network provided by the binh dinh province sub department of environment protection soep in general nasa aw3d30 and merit generated the closest shape of the lrb survey river network for the high land region in an lao river and the low land areas kim son river area and the area located close to the lrb outlet fig 6a and 6c the srtm 30 and 90 and tandem x indicated modest river extraction reflected by their resemblance to the survey river network however they have shown mismatches between high and low land regions in the junction part on the other hand the aster gdem2 performed worst with many failures with the river network especially in the kim son river area in the comparison of the longer river branch an lao river fig 1b which contributes primarily to the water discharge to the outlet of the lrb the nasa and aw3d30 performed well with river network lengths of 85 27 and 84 95 km respectively compared to the actual data of 85 km in contrast the merit srtm 90 and aster gdem2 over generated the an lao river length by 90 67 88 9 and 88 38 km respectively while the srtm 30 and tandem x fared poorly with lower delineated river length at 81 03 and 77 83 km respectively table 3 in the comparison of the second river kim son fig 1b and 6c southern low land region the total length of kim son river is similar among dem products ranging from 63 36 km aster gdem2 to 67 1 km merit compared to the actual length as 65 km table 3 however the aw3d30 has 70 km of river length that has been considered over generated another finding showed that the number of an lao river branches main and side branches varies significantly from 17 nasa to 26 srtm 30 except for aster gdem2 which has a lack of generated branches at 14 compared to other dem products furthermore aster gdem2 issues were found in all extraction locations showing an unstable outlet river network fig 6a and low land river network re generation fig 6b hence our findings indicated that over under generated river branches main and side branches were also associated with a mismatch in river network direction resulting in a difference in river length and is evidence for high and low land regions commonly influenced by dem resolution fig 7 and table 4 show the difference in drainage density dd km km 2 of dem products when compared to the 10 m reference dem produced under the same condition threshold technique procedure in the assessment of drainage density dd the higher dd the shorter the distance that runoff must travel via the channel and the shorter the time required for runoff to reach a channel murphey 1977 patton and baker 1976 strahler 1964 the drainage density plot dd km km2 of the eight scenarios corresponding to the chosen dem products was then shown for further discussion fig 7 table 4 in general nasa srtm 30 and aster gdem2 performed better than merit srtm 90 aw3d30 and tandem x specifically there is a minor difference between nasa srtm 30 aster gdem2 and the reference dem in high and low land areas an lao river kim son river fig 7 table 4 however these dem products performed very well in the kim son river with many familiar and unchanged parts marked as red circle also in the river junction of an lao and kim son rivers on the other hand merit srtm 90 and tandem x showed high differences in dd compared to the 10 m reference dem in both high and low land regions aw3d30 mostly showed its difference in the kim son river area fig 7 thus the better drainage density calculation would give authors a better understanding of the peak flood analysis conducted for this dem characteristic analysis in this case study the watershed delineation was performed in the same condition with the same threshold and catchment outlet as mentioned in section 4 3 watershed delineation has been identified as one of the most critical factors in assessing dem performance with implications for streamflow computation in swat chen et al 2021 nasa and aw3d30 figs 8 and 9 have shown the closest subbasin delineation to the reference number of subbasins and areas regarding subbasin characteristics indeed they have demonstrated a solid delineation with the average subbasin area for lrb being 41 04 and 40 15 km2 along with standard errors of 1 56 and 3 04 respectively when compared to the 10 m reference dem 40 69 km2 for the high and low land regions in the northern and southern lrb as well as the area close to the catchment outlet fig 8 on the other hand srtm 30 42 90 km2 and aster gdem2 42 75 km2 have shown higher errors as revealed in fig 9 most dem products except for merit srtm 90 and aster gdem2 performed well over the lrb especially in the catchment outlet low land area with a very little mismatch of delineation compared to the 10 m reference dem fig 9b besides aster gdem2 has performed remarkably poorly with many incorrect delineation points especially in creating an additional subbasin similar to merit fig 9b aster gdem2 merit and srtm 90 were considerably inaccurate for the watershed delineation for high and low land areas fig 9e 9f 9b and 9d in the middle high land regions srtm 90 provided a wildly inaccurate delineation compared to the other dem products fig 9c besides srtm 30 and aster gdem2 provided incorrect delineations in the intersection subbasin fig 9d thus this finding fulfills and re confirms the key finding mentioned in figs 3 and 5 demonstrating the other key findings of many previous studies by tan et al 2015 2018 and xu et al 2016 mentioning that failures in the river network and subbasin re generation occur mainly in low land areas merit aster gdem2 and srtm 90 delineated the western highland part of rlb incorrectly compared to the 10 m reference dem fig 9e and similarly occurred in the catchment s eastern high land region fig 9f interestingly when comparing the closed relationship dem products nasa and srtm 30 we found that these products give detected points errors similarly but srtm 30 could be realized as easy to provide inaccurate delineation in intersection subbasin especially with small size subbasins fig 9d in summary nasa and aw3d30 perform well with watershed and stream delineation showing accurate adequacy for both high and low land regions compared to other dem products which would significantly affect river characteristic re generation and streamflow simulation 5 3 topography slope and river basin characteristics the slope varies significantly between 45 21 srtm 90 and 49 85 srtm 30 compared to 47 90 10 m reference dem whereas the minimum slope remained constant at 0 the maximum slope is sensitive to dem resolution while the minimum slope is not as tan et al 2015 2018 mentioned nasa aster gdem2 and aw3d30 products have shown the nearest value of maximum slope with a difference of 1 92 1 65 and 1 50 compared with the 10 m reference dem table 5 the maximum and standard deviation sd of slope dropped as dem resolution decreased table 5 comparable to tan et al 2015 and zhang et al 2014 whose findings indicate that slope and elevation variation was related more to dem resolution variation all dem products overestimated the mean slope by 0 87 tandem x to 8 35 srtm 30 when compared to the actual value of 23 given by nguyen 2013 or under estimated by 4 13 10 m reference dem the mean elevation of the lrb was calculated in the same range in all dem products and slightly over estimated compared to the actual data of 277 m mentioned by nguyen 2013 the difference ranges from 280 55 m tandem x to 287 41 m aw3d30 the lowest difference shown with srtm 30 1 81 nasa 1 83 and tandem x 1 28 and the highest with aw3d30 3 76 table 5 in summary nasa srtm 30 and tandem x perform relatively well compared to the actual elevation and the 10 m reference dem the same delineation procedure has been given for dem products indeed the same threshold and catchment outlet location have been provided and the difference in the watershed delineation has been found and mentioned figs 8 and 9 with the number of sub basins changed unevenly table 6 it initially resulted from the difference in dem characteristics srtm 30 aw3d30 and tandem x have achieved the highest number of subbasins 33 while merit nasa srtm 90 and aster gdem2 with the number of subbasins recorded are only 31 table 6 on the other hand a difference in the number of hrus hydrologic response units has been found that varied significantly corresponding to the dem products ranging from 259 to 308 the basin area km2 varies extremely small among the dem products used which is similar to tan et al 2018 key findings that were conducted in the johor river basin 1652 km2 with minor differences compared to earthenv dem90 1648 km2 aster gdem2 1629 km2 and srtm v4 1 1642 km2 or khan et al 2014 with their findings for the upper indus basin delineation using srtm and aster gdem2 indeed the closet value 1332 64 km2 obtained by the merit dem followed by nasa dem 1332 19 km2 and the most different value 1309 67 km2 acquired with tandem x compared to the actual area at 1402 km2 nguyen 2013 and reference 10 m dem 1333 km2 table 6 indeed with the lower incidence of short range topographic changes near borders coarse dem is more suited for delineating river basins as stated by charrier and li 2012 and highlighted again by tan et al 2015 2018 5 4 dem uncertainty impacts on the catchment streamflow the seven dem products merit nasa srtm 30 srtm 90 aster gdem2 aw3d30 tandem x and the 10 m reference have been used to simulate the catchment streamflow using the semi distributed swat model with all the parameters were set as the same to ensure the consistency for the hydrological assessment then ten calibrating parameters were used with their fitted value throughout in the calibration stage are also taken into account depending on their sensitivity as explained by araza et al 2020 according to arnold et al 2012 we proposed a pre checked conceptual approach and compared the un calibrated models to observe the main hydrological outputs including surface flow groundwater flow lateral flow and peak flow most dem products performed well with chosen metrics kge r2 rmse nse and mae as shown in table 7 table 7 shows the comparison of metrics for different dem scenarios in general there is not much difference among dem products the 10 m reference dem showed the best streamflow simulation due to its high quality as a lidar product which has also been chosen by chaubey et al 2005 and lin et al 2010 2013 for their studies other dem products showed a high correlation among dem and are indicated as good kge r2 rsme nse and mae compared to the 10 m reference dem using the model evaluation guidelines section 4 1 the average monthly discharge from 1998 to 2020 is presented fig 10a in general the simulated streamflow has been found with high similarity among dem products simulations fig 10 consistent with previous studies gautam et al 2019 lin et al 2013 tan et al 2015 tran et al 2022 the streamflow is concentrated mainly in the last four months of the year during the flood season september to december with the highest discharge in november the monthly discharge peak volume is well represented across the dem products ranging from 269 m3 s to 273 m3 s compared to the streamflow of the reference dem at 275 m3 s furthermore when considering the last four months wet season and the first eight months dry season nasa srtm 30 aster gdem2 and aw3d30 provided the best simulation compared to other dem products and observed streamflow fig 10d there is a high correlation for annual simulated streamflow amongst dem products and the reference dem with the average of yearly discharge at 73 69 m3 s reference dem followed by nasa 74 54 m3 s tandem x 74 65 m3 s srtm 90 74 79 m3 s whereas the simulated streamflow is approximately the same for srtm 90 aster gdem2 and aw3d30 fig 10b furthermore during the 23 year simulation period 1998 2020 most dem products showed similar simulations with flood peaks fig 10c which was confirmed by a comparison between the drainage density of the reference dem and other dem products as presented and explained in fig 7 and table 4 however we found that the tandem x 90 m showed very high similarity in terms of flood peak simulation compared to the 10 m reference dem and other dem products after calibrating with the reference dem s calibrating fitted values indeed the calibrated streamflow of tandem x shows a range of 4 1 37 difference m3 s compared to the reference dem while other dem products show higher differences ranging from 9 to 61 another surprising key finding is that the two close relationship products nasa and srtm dems show good performance better than tandem x in terms of simulated flood peak as well as streamflow simulation table 7 before calibrating and they become significantly less accurate after calibration to confirm it we decided to perform some more scenarios for testing the tandem x and srtm 90 s ability during the calibration same resolution of 90 m then the calibrating parameter fitted values from other different dem resolutions 10 30 m have been applied and the results were shown in fig 11 the calibration of tandem x 90 m using the calibrating fitted values from the 10 m reference dem showed a smaller difference in simulated flood peak fig 11 b than other higher resolution 30 m dem products nasa srtm 30 aw3d30 and aster gdem2 compared to the reference dem in terms of flood peak it thus questioned us the reason for the inconsistent impacts between dem resolutions to the captured flood peak to understand it some scenarios for the streamflow observation have been suggested to conduct using the two 90 m dem products srtm and tandem x the results indicated that the srtm 90 m showed slightly less accuracy in flood peak simulation when calibrated by the coarser dem s 30 m calibrating fitted values fig 11a however this finding is not consistent in the case of using tandem x 90 m when the coarser dem s 30 m calibrating fitted values showed a significantly estimate the flood peak compared to the 10 m reference dem fig 11b furthermore our key finding showed that the least difference could be found if the validated dem has the exact resolution as the dem product used for calibrating as shown in fig 11 throughout these scenarios our study revealed that the best hydrological simulation could be achieved by using the same resolution dem in the calibration and validation of other dem products besides an assumption has been made indicating the reason why tandem x 90 m showed good flood peak simulation which might come from the suitability of the chosen parameters during the calibration and validation part however it might be the particular characteristic of tandem x among other chosen dem products which could be useful as an initial finding to study more about this dem product due to its potential capability to use in terms of hydrological application if it is validated by using suitable calibrating parameters extracted from an appropriate resolution dem in this case is the 30 m resolution the surface runoff and streamflow calculations within the dem products are similar in terms of streamflow tendency and volume monthly and annual highlighting that swat simulated streamflow did not vary significantly between the different dem scenarios which was expected as the curve number cn used by swat to simulate surface runoff does not consider topography which is consistent with the findings of tan et al 2015 2018 in the kelantan river basin malaysia and sharma and tiwari 2014 with lower dem resolution 90 m merit srtm 90 and tandem x are under simulated both monthly and annual discharge due to the loss of topographical information previously explained by hirt et al 2010 and tan et al 2015 2018 in addition the difference in watershed scale and smoothening of the slope indicates that streamflow is more sensitive to dem resolution contradicting findings from lin et al 2013 and zhang et al 2014 but consistent with chaubey et al 2005 gautam et al 2019 and tan et al 2015 2018 on the other hand the dem topography information does not appear to significantly impact the primary additional hydrological results such as surface runoff groundwater flow precipitation water percolation water yield deep aquifer recharge potential evapotranspiration and sediment yield table 8 which was explained as the curve number cn used by swat to simulate surface runoff does not consider topography it is then consistent with the findings of prior case studies by lin et al 2013 tan et al 2015 2018 and zhang et al 2014 according to the actual values from nguyen 2013 the estimated precipitation table 8 derived using dem products differs by 10 from the actual precipitation at 2460 mm year the dem evapotranspiration revealed comparable records with differences ranging from 3 to 7 compared to the observed 630 mm year and within a 6 variation compared to 1830 mm year of water yield table 8 however the lateral flow appears to be more affected than other hydrological components as it varies considerably based on the dem resolution 10 m 30 m and 90 m table 8 sloan and moore 1984 have explained their findings in the kinematic storage model which was again emphasized and highlighted not only once but also in the case study of tan et al 2018 and more thoroughly in swat documentation written by neitsch et al 2011 as the drop in mean slopes with coarser dem resolutions leading to the considerable change in lateral flow furthermore carlston 1963 found that when drainage density increases baseflow discharge into a stream decrease for a given basin due to less infiltration to contribute to baseflow then more water entering the drainage basin soon following a rainfall event departs quickly through streams and does not infiltrate to contribute to baseflow discharge thus surface flow surq is comparable across dem products while lateral flow latq differs between dem resolutions 10 30 and 90 m the difference in the estimation of groundwater has been observed between the finest used dem reference 10 m and other dem products 30 m and 90 m because each grid cell in the dem uses the mean value of the entire square discretized area as elevation value finer resolutions lead to a higher level of accuracy in water balance estimation resulting in a more accurate simulation consistent with the results of borz√¨ et al 2020 with their case study in the alcantara river basin italy as a consequence when compared to other dem products nasa 30 m was ranked as the most suitable dem product for lrb followed by srtm 30 30 m which could imply satisfactory outcomes as a first step to be used in part for other locations in central vietnam they performed well in terms of basin and stream delineation demonstrating similarities in characteristics of catchment streamflow when compared to the 10 m reference dem and actual data provided by nguyen 2013 binh dinh province sub department of environment protection soep and vietnam institute of geosciences and mineral resources vigmr furthermore they have given good values for hydrological properties discharge peak flood or similarities in the additional hydrological products in dry and wet seasons 5 5 streamflow performance validation using cross validation one of the critical tasks to have a good result in terms of hydrological application is validation which has been mentioned with its importance and impact on the simulation of main hydrological products falorni et al 2005 gyamfi et al 2016 hosseini and khaleghi 2020 khakbaz et al 2012 refsgaard 1997 uuemaa et al 2020 in this study all of the inputs were set under the same conditions over the chosen simulation period the validation of dem performance after the calibration step is essential to reveal the authors suggested choosing the 10 m reference dem and the nasa dem 30 m to perform the cross validation due to their resolution and good performance through the streamflow simulation section 5 4 the results are shown in table 9 and fig 12 we found that the best performance of streamflow and flood peak simulations in terms of runoff volume and trend would be achieved if the calibration and validation were performed for the same dem table 1 the higher performances with higher values of r2 rmse nse mae and kge for flood peak estimation through dem products after validation using different sets of calibrating fitted value parameters have been shown in table 9 and fig 12 when validating a lower resolution dem i e 30 m nasa dem using the calibrating parameters of the higher resolution dem 10 m reference dem the simulated streamflow trend and volume have a high correlation compared to them in the case the calibration and validation were performed for the same dem product table 9 fig 12b however when the validation has been reverted which means the higher resolution dem i e 10 m reference dem validated by the lower resolution dem i e 30 m nasa dem the streamflow trend volume becomes less accurate 40 with performance metrics compared to the un calibrated model and there was a significant underestimate of the flood peak over the simulation period fig 12a 6 limitations and further studies we acknowledge the study s constraint is that it could only focus on a single watershed for revealing investigation of the chosen dems performances our most significant challenge is collecting the reference dem which must comply strictly with country standards and authorities regarding collection technique product calibration and validation thus for future studies we would like to collect more high resolution dem product to perform the assessment for entire vietnam which would be useful for other neighboring regions 7 conclusions the comprehensive assessment framework and implementation of the swat model were used to investigate the relevance of the most recent global resolution and freely accessible space borne dem products using hydrological models in central vietnam this study used the reference dem 10 m to assess the other dem products quality merit nasa srtm aster gdem2 aw3d30 and tandem x with the chosen resolutions 30 m and 90 m four designed criteria for assessment were used i statistical analysis ii river basin characteristics iii the dem uncertainty on streamflow simulation and iv cross validation s impacts on the hydrological application as a result nasa 30 m and srtm 30 30 m dem products were determined to be the most accurate of the chosen dem products whereas aster gdem2 30 m merit 90 m and srtm 90 m are the less accurate in this study srtm 30 is slightly better than nasa in high land regions but not in the low land areas in terms of elevation retrieved and subbasin and river network delineations merit tandem x and aster gdem2 performed poorly with 2 30 1 83 and 2 04 mismatch in peak elevation m respectively on the other hand nasa aw3d30 and merit produced the closest shape to the lrb survey river network with high land regions in the an lao river or low land parts area of kim son river and close to the lrb outlet srtm 30 srtm 90 and tandem x indicated modest river extraction due to their resemblance to the survey river network but have a mismatched delineation in the connection part between high and low land regions although the merit srtm 90 and aster gdem2 over generated the an lao river length the srtm 30 and tandem x produced an inadequate result with shorter river lengths and only nasa and aw3d30 performed well with river network lengths that were similar to the survey river network although kge and other model performance metrics r2 nse rmse mae cannot be directly compared and should not be treated as approximately equivalent clark et al 2021 knoben et al 2019 mizukami et al 2019 our study has revealed its high reliability to calculate the uncertainty of flood peak estimation which has been noticed in this study for other further case studies nasa and aw3d30 showed the most accurate subbasin delineation number of subbasins and area while srtm 30 highlighted errors for intersection subbasin delineation especially for small size subbasins srtm 30 and aster gdem2 have also given inaccurate delineations in the narrowed subbasin borders in the kim son river area furthermore compared to the 10 m reference dem product merit aster gdem2 and srtm 90 were identified as showing many errors in the western high land portion of rlb and the same result occurred for these three dem products in the eastern high land region for streamflow analysis except for lateral flow groundwater flow water percolation and sediment yield the dem resolution and source had little effect on most of other hydrological components this study showed that streamflow is concentrated mainly during the flood season with a peak in november and higher dem resolution produces better streamflow simulation results this study has thoroughly evaluated the performance of nasa and other chosen dem products such as merit srtm aster gdem2 aw3d30 and tandem x in a wide ranging comparison these primary findings presented a good approach for revealing comprehensive dem product analysis which could be used as a reference for other vietnamese case studies to understand better the impacts of dem input to simulate streamflow and basin characteristics this work fulfilled previous work on hydrological modeling and decision making in the lower mekong river basin mohammed et al 2018a b c where an improved digital elevation model would be quite helpful in understanding the surface and subsurface routing of water finally this study s key findings help regional decision makers and stakeholders plan for future water resource management issues and contribute to the current literature that uses physically based hydrological models to investigate the implications of the digital elevation model dem fidelity on hydrologic simulations around the world credit authorship contribution statement thanh nhan duc tran conceptualization

combined hydrometeorological hydrochemical and isotopic data stable water and nitrate isotopes from three catchments with different predominant land use effects forest agricultural and settlement new hydrological insights for the study region our study underlines that current climate change and associated hydrological changes such as decrease in flow play an important role in the transport and dynamics of nutrients in the catchment we have found that due to the different origins and pathways individual nutrients had diverse behaviour patterns in streams and responded differently to changing climate hydrological patterns in streams became clear when systematic and continuous monitoring under a changing climate was applied highlighting the need for such data to better understand the impact of hydrological drivers particularly for long term dynamics in three studied catchments streamflow showed a decreasing trend in line with rising air temperature declining snow cover and increasing evapotranspiration time series analyses of nitrate concentrations revealed decreasing trends whereas dissolved organic carbon increased in all catchments regardless of land use long term trends of total phosphorus concentrations were positive in anthropogenically impacted streams stable nitrate isotopes indicated distinct nitrate sources and processes but also their seasonality in relation to

ecosystems to buffer or process nutrient inputs hejzlar et al 2003 seitzinger et al 2006 gruber and galloway 2008 elser and bennett 2011 changes in land use land cover and climate change influenced

ponnou delaffon et al 2020 in both anthropogenically used and near natural catchments nutrient losses lead to surface water and groundwater pollution which can affect water quality thomas et al 2016 kop√°ƒçek et al 2016 mcdonough et al 2020 the influence of land use and nutrient sources on the export of nutrients to surface waters can be enhanced or on the contrary dampened by the hydrological regime and climate for example runoff from agricultural land areas promotes the release of nutrients and other pollutants through washing out of diffuse sources of n and p pollution ahearn et al 2005 delkash et al 2018 urban areas reduce land permeability leading to higher runoff volumes lower percolation and increased discharge of nutrient loads from non point pollution sources nie et al 2011 lee

of the ≈ô√≠mov reservoir which is located in the elbe basin in the headwaters of the vltava river for the analysis of the processes that currently control nutrient runoff from the landscape in this region as well as in other parts of central europe socio economic changes have occurred since the middle of the 20th century which significantly affected the composition of surface waters kop√°ƒçek et al 2017 vystavna et al 2017a znachor et al 2018 negative impacts on surface waters have been increasing since the 1950s as a result of changes in land use and accompanying activities in particular the intensification of agriculture with the consolidation of cultivated fields use of artificial fertilizers soil drainage increase in population and urbanized areas sewerage of settlements and intensive air pollution and deposition of acidifying compounds of sulphur and nitrogen surface water pollution peaked in the 1980s and after 1990 when the state controlled economic system in the country changed to a system with a market economy pollution decreased mainly thanks to the introduction of effective treatment of municipal and industrial wastewater a sharp decrease in the application of synthetic fertilizers primarily potassium and phosphorus fertilizers in agricultural production the transition to organic farming and effective desulphurization and reduction of atmospheric nitrogen emissions kop√°ƒçek et al 2012 2013 2021 hejzlar et al 2016 the rapid decrease in the intensity of surface water pollution from anthropogenic sources lasted for one decade and ended in the entire country and in the ≈ô√≠mov reservoir catchment at the beginning of the new millennium in the last twenty years the concentration of p and n in the inflows to the ≈ô√≠mov reservoir has changed little which is proven by direct analyses of the inflow into the reservoir and bioindicators monitored in the reservoir e g the isotopic composition of fish scales va≈°ek et al 2021 or changes in the phytoplankton assemblage znachor et al 2020 at the same time since the 1990s as a result of climate change temperature has increased and precipitation patterns have changed vystavna et al 2017a znachor et al 2018 kop√°ƒçek et al 2021 which is the likely cause of the long term increase in doc concentration in this basin hejzlar et al 2003 znachor et al 2018 we used datasets of water quality indicators from the last two decades including nitrate no3 n total phosphorus tp and dissolved organic carbon doc in three catchments in the ≈ô√≠mov reservoir basin with different land uses mainly forest agricultural and urban but also a shorter time series of stable isotopes in the water molecule Œ¥ 18o Œ¥ 2h of h2o and stable nitrate isotopes Œ¥ 15n Œ¥ 18o of no3 for understanding nutrient dynamics the objectives of our study were to i demonstrate the effect of land use on hydrological and water chemistry in time ii understand the seasonal variation in water chemistry seasonality and its relation to flow iii assess the water origin and trace nutrient sources by coupling hydrochemical and isotopic data and iv discuss the role of hydrological and biogeochemical processes controlling nutrient dynamics the results of this study can be applicable to other catchments with similar land uses and can be used in river basin management to design land use strategies under a changing climate 2 materials and

influence on the water composition in the catchments even though arable land covers significant parts of the area in both the settlement and agricultural catchments the settlement stream is significantly affected by wastewater inputs and its catchment has a much higher population density and share of urban areas compared to the agricultural stream table 1 the studied catchments are located in the same temperate climate and have comparable climatic characteristics with an average annual temperature between 5 3 c and 8 5 c and an average annual precipitation between 669 and 1051

water areas agricultural and settlement catchments fig 1 and table 1 compared to the agricultural and forest catchments the population density in the settlement catchment was 10 times higher table 1

lower and upper parts of the ≈ô√≠mov reservoir catchment have relatively lower average terrain slopes than the large agricultural catchment where the average terrain slope is higher due to steep

conditions that occur during evaporation if d excess was less than 10 we considered the water to be evaporating dansgaard 1964 a dual Œ¥ 15n no3 vs Œ¥ 18o no3 linear regression plot was used to compare measured values to the range of representative values from common nitrate sources to help assess biogeochemical processes in water based on kendall 1998 2008 matiatos et al 2021 2 4 hydrological model for active water storage assessment long term data on the q of the agricultural stream mal≈°e river at po≈ôe≈°√≠n were obtained from the website of chmi available at https www chmi cz historicka data hydrologie daily temperature precipitation and snow depth were obtained from the nearest meteorological station in karlstift austria https www zamg ac at cms de klima klimauebersichten jahrbuch daily q in the streams was modelled based on a hydrological analogy with data from those close by continuously measured streams which yielded the best correlation with the measured discharges the modelled data were then fitted to the measured points by minimizing the residuals between the observed and modelled data a lumped 4 parameter model gr4j with two internal water tanks production and routing and with a snow component for the daily formation of rainfall runoff developed by perrin 2002 for rural catchments was used to construct a catchment water balance model that relates runoff to rainfall precipitation including snowpack and evapotranspiration using daily data the simulated amount of water in the production tank was considered to be representative of the active water storage in the catchment from which the runoff is formed see si 6 for more details 3 results 3 1 hydrological and water chemistry time series monthly average q in streams decreased from

precipitation despite some slight overlap between the samples from the forest stream and precipitation fig 4 major ions as indicated by ec and in fig si 2 and no3 n were plotted close to each other and were distinctly separated from tp and doc which were also separated from each other fig 4 the first two principal components explained 70 of the variation nitrate concentration and ec and major ions showed the highest values in winter and spring and the lowest values in summer fig 5a and si 1 tp and doc showed an opposite seasonal trend with the highest concentrations in summer and the lowest in winter fig 5a doc showed significant positive correlations p 0 001 with q in all streams no3 n was positively correlated p 0 001 with q in the settlement and agricultural streams while tp was correlated with q positively p 0 001 in the agricultural streams and negatively p 0 001 in the forest stream 3 3 stable water and nitrate isotopes stable water isotopes for the forest stream were plotted directly on the global meteoric water line while those for agricultural and settlement streams were plotted below this line fig si 3a the mean Œ¥ 18o values were 9 8 in the forest 9 6 in agricultural and 8 6 in settlement streams fig si 3c the amplitude of seasonal Œ¥ 18o variation in the forest agricultural and settlement streams were 1 3 1 4 and 1 8 respectively with lowest values in february march and highest values in july august fig si 3c the d excess values fig si 3d showed seasonal trends opposite to those of Œ¥ 18o with highest average values in the forest stream 9 8 and the lowest in the settlement stream 5 6 the mean water transit time was less than one year in all streams fig si 3d with a minimum of 0 5 years in the settlement stream and a maximum of 0 9 years in the forest stream fig si 3d the average values of nitrate isotopes were lowest in the forest stream 2 4 and 3 3 for Œ¥ 15n no3 and Œ¥ 18o no3 respectively and highest in the settlement stream 12 1 and 2 8 for Œ¥ 15n no3 and Œ¥ 18o no3 respectively fig 6a nitrate isotope values in the forest stream plotted within the overlap of the published areas of nitrified synthetic fertilizers and rain soil nitrogen and manure septic waste kendall et al 2008 matiatos et al 2021 fig 6b the correlation between Œ¥ 15n no3 and Œ¥ 18o no3 in the forest stream was insignificant table si 2 nitrate isotope values in the agricultural stream overlapped value ranges representing nitrate originating from soil manure and septic waste and formed a Œ¥ 15n no3 vs Œ¥ 18o no3 regression line with a slope of 1 1 5 p 0 01 r 2 0 36 nitrate isotope values in the settlement stream mainly plotted in the value ranges representing manure and septic waste fig 6b forming a regression line between Œ¥ 15n no3 and Œ¥ 18o no3 with a slope of 1 2 5 p 0 01 r 2 0 58 in the forest and settlement streams Œ¥ 15n no3 values were higher during low q conditions in late summer autumn than in other seasons fig 7a c in the agricultural stream average Œ¥ 15n no3 and Œ¥ 18Œø no3 values decreased from the spring to the winter periods fig 7b however the seasonal patterns in all catchments were biased by the q peaks recorded in different seasons for example a similar temporal pattern of low Œ¥ 15ŒΩ ŒΩŒø3 values and high no3 n values was observed in february 2020 in the forest and agricultural and june july 2020 agricultural and settlement during high q conditions fig 7 the Œ¥ 18o no3 values showed more pronounced and diverse seasonal patterns with the highest variation in the forest and settlement streams and the lowest variation in the agricultural stream fig 7 the Œ¥ 18o no3 was significantly p 0 05 positively correlated with doc and no3 n in the forest stream table si 2 and significantly p 0 05 negatively correlated with doc in the settlement stream table si 2 the Œ¥ 15n no3 had a significantly p 0 05 negative correlation with no3 n in the forest and settlement streams table si 2 however in the settlement stream Œ¥ 15n no3 had also a significantly p 0 05 negative correlation with doc and tp table si 2 additionally Œ¥ 18Œø h2o was significantly positively correlated with doc in all streams table si 2 in the forest and agricultural streams Œ¥ 18Œø h2o was significantly negatively correlated with no3 n table si 2 regarding seasonality in the forest stream the relationship of Œ¥ 15n no3 with no3 n was positive in the cold period november april and negative in the warm period may november fig 7a the Œ¥ 18o no3 values generally followed no3 n seasonal patterns and displayed a gradual increase along with discharge during snowmelt in the forest stream fig 7a in the agricultural stream the Œ¥ 18o no3 values followed no3 n patterns during low q in autumn fig 7b in the settlement stream the Œ¥ 18o no3 seasonal variation followed a trend that was inverse to that of no3 n fig 7c 4 discussion the studied streams showed well distinguished hydrochemical compositions fig 5 we conclude that this pattern is due to the predominant land use and catchment area fig 1 the settlement stream exhibited higher no3 n and major ion concentrations compared to the forest and agricultural due to higher population density 595 inh km 2 in the settlement vs 36 and 0 inh km 2 in the agricultural and forest streams respectively and municipal wastewater inputs table 1 a higher contribution of sewage was also confirmed by a higher average Œ¥ 15ŒΩ ŒΩŒø3 value in settlement the average was 12 1 than in other streams average 8 fig 6 moreover the settlement stream had low discharge table 1 and thus low dilution of anthropogenic inputs the forest stream had higher average doc concentrations and differed from the settlement and agricultural streams by this variable fig 5a the higher doc can be explained by transport of doc from wetland soils on peat accumulations covering ca 20 of the forest catchment area wetland runoff is generally high in doc because anoxic conditions do not allow complete oxidation of organic matter to co2 musolff et al 2018 this is also supported by previous studies worldwide where wetlands in forested catchments are found to be a primary source of doc e g strohmeier et al 2013 nahlik and fennessy 2016 kop√°ƒçek et al 2018 despite the differences in land use and catchment size the streams showed similar trends of increasing doc concentrations and decreasing no3 n concentrations over time fig 3 and table si 1 additionally the catchments experienced a reduction in q particularly in anthropogenically impacted agricultural and settlement catchments fig 2 these changes are explained by meteorological dynamics such as rising air temperature and evapotranspiration that are observed in local table si 1 regional ministry of the environment of the czech republic 2015 and global scales ipcc 2021 these meteorological drivers directly affect changes in the snow regime less persistent snowpack reduction of the snow water equivalent in the czech republic jen√≠ƒçek et al 2021 and in many european catchments fontrodona et al 2018 additionally hydrological changes can be driven by variations in the north atlantic oscillation nao which strongly influences european weather and precipitation distribution resulting in the frequency of droughts and floods ipcc 2021 vystavna et al 2020b 2021b moreover the flow decline was mostly pronounced in the two anthropogenically impacted catchments fig 2 with less forest coverage fig 1 table 1 shorter water residence time fig si 3 and less active water storage fig si 5 in the forest catchment in contrast water is probably stored within the saturated and unsaturated zones in soil and wetlands significantly increase the water residence time as observed in other forested catchments dunn et al 2007 roa garcia and weiler 2010 therefore we believe that settlement and agricultural catchments probably drain faster even in short dry periods and but also recharge faster after rainfall this in turn impacts the nutrient sources and processes in the catchment particularly a decrease in flow can lead to the decrease of the sediments transport from the catchment and in contrast an increase in flow can lead to an increase in the soil erosion and more intensive transport of nutrients from the catchment dunkerley and brown 1999 we even observed that no3 n concentrations increased and occasionally exceeded the world health organization who threshold value of 11 3 mg l 1 no3 n year 2017 who 2017 fig 6 during flow peaks the nutrient dynamics response to flow changes was also observed in a previous study vystavna et al 2017a the decrease in nitrate concentrations over time in all catchments fig 3 can be explained by the decrease in acid atmospheric emissions and reduced nitrate export from the soil kop√°ƒçek et al 2012 the air temperature increases along with unchanged or lower precipitation amounts table si 1 in parallel to increased evaporation probably led to decreasing soil moisture in the agricultural and settlement catchments causing less topsoil flushing and higher accumulation of nitrate which washed out only during snowmelt and or after summer storm runoff events fig 6 as observed in other studies as well kato et al 2009 vystavna et al 2021a increasing nitrate values were observed together with decreasing Œ¥ 15ŒΩ ŒΩŒø3 values in the settlement stream table si 2 implying that the increase in no3 n concentration could be related to an increased contribution from a source with lower Œ¥ 15ŒΩ ŒΩŒø3 values such as ammonium synthetic fertilizers and or increased nitrification conversion of ammonium to nitrate of the original nitrate source matiatos et al 2021 in the agricultural and forest stream the no3 n concentration increased mainly with q in april may fig 7 this was possibly related to the release of nitrate mainly derived from soil nitrification which was washed off with snowmelt mayer et al 2002 ohte et al 2010 vystavna et al 2021a like in the study of matiatos et al 2021 in our study as well high Œ¥ 18Œø ŒΩŒø3 values coincided with elevated nitrate e g february 2020 in fig 7a april 2020 in fig 7b which was shown to be caused by an increased proportion of nitrate originating from atmospheric deposition in the forest stream soil nitrification can be traced by the depletion of 15n values with increasing no3 n kendall 1998 kendall et al 2008 fig 7 overall given that the terrestrial nitrate sources in the forest stream are generally constant throughout the year temporal variations of Œ¥ 15ŒΩ ŒΩŒø3 values should rather be attributed to hydrology atmospheric inputs and biogeochemical processes mayer et al 2002 in the mixed land use catchments settlement and agricultural table 1 fig 1 increasing nitrate concentrations and decreasing Œ¥ 15ŒΩ ŒΩŒø3 and Œ¥ 18Œø no3 were recorded under high q in summer fig 7 this was likely attributed to increased wash out of low Œ¥ 15n sources such as non nitrate synthetic fertilizers and nh4 with precipitation the positive slope of the regression lines of Œ¥ 18Œø no3 vs Œ¥ 15ŒΩ no3 in the agricultural and settlement catchments fig 6 and significant negative correlation between Œ¥ 15ŒΩ no3 and no3 n in these anthropogenically impacted streams table si 2 indicates possible denitrification however different positions of the regression lines show that the responsible nitrate sources and or their mixture were different fig 6 for example the agricultural stream was characterized by lower Œ¥ 18Œø no3 than the settlement stream which could be due to the lower degree of denitrification that occurred as the water passed through the catchment e g due to lack of organic matter the forest catchment was characterized by Œ¥ 15ŒΩ no3 values characteristic of rain and soil passage while the settlement catchment Œ¥ 15ŒΩ no3 values fell within the range of soil manure and sewage passage and were too high to be derived from fertilizers or rain fig 6 similar patterns of nitrate sources and or their mixture were observed for the larger slapy vystavna et al 2017a and for the seversky donets vystavna et al 2017b catchments in contrast to no3 n the concentrations of doc showed an increasing trend in all catchments the strong relationship between doc and q in all streams fig 5b demonstrate the hydrological control over doc transport we suggest that doc is mostly mobilized from soils at the interface between terrestrial and aquatic systems as shown in other studies e g de wit et al 2021 musolff et al 2018 hejzlar et al 2003 and worrall and burt 2007 the increasing air temperatures can lead to faster mineralisation of soil organic matter and soil weathering which also promotes growth in doc concentrations musolff et al 2018 another indication of this is the increase in an increase in geogenic ca2 that often accompanies an increase in doc concentration table si 1 vystavna et al 2020a moreover reducing so4 2 deposition from acid rain and increasing soil ph increases the solubility of doc and facilitates its transport into streams ekstrom et al 2011 kop√°ƒçek et al 2012 raike et al 2012 brag√©e et al 2015 schmidt et al 2021 2022 hydrological transport of doc is also confirmed by the significant positive correlation between Œ¥ 18Œø h2o and doc in all streams table si 2 with higher concentrations of doc during the warm season when stream water is isotopically enriched similar to doc the tp concentrations also increased but only in the agricultural and settlement catchments table si 1 in these catchments possible sources of tp include animal waste manure artificial and organic fertilizers leaf litter and treated sewage vystavna et al 2017a the p deposited on the soil and weathered in the soil is transported to the stream during high q events which is reflected in the positive correlation of tp and q in the agricultural stream farming practices and the amount of rainfall can thus increase tp concentrations vystavna et al 2017a high precipitation events during the growing season can also cause surface and subsurface runoff from agricultural land to streams increasing tp nitrate doc and ion concentrations and negatively affecting water quality elser and bennett 2011 gruber n galloway 2008 hejzlar et al 2003 therefore these increasing trends may be due to more frequent changes in soil moisture and the faster mineralisation and weathering of soil in the warmer and drier climate of recent decades the czech republic s average temperature has been rising faster than the world average over the last two decades and this observation indicates both a notable increase in the number of days with high rainfall intensity in the past few decades ministry of the environment the czech republic 2015 znachor et al 2018 ipcc 2021 as well as a decrease in snow cover and snow water equivalent jen√≠ƒçek et al 2021 climate simulations show that these trends are likely to continue until the end of the 21st century ipcc 2021 based on this prediction we concluded that the trends in doc no3 n and tp in all catchments will also continue and might even exacerbate with stronger seasonal variations the high seasonality in nutrient loads will impact downstream reservoirs and thus drinking water production 5 summary and conclusions doc no3 n and tp behaved differently in the three studied catchments due to their distinct sources related to the land use for example tp concentrations increased in anthropogenically impacted catchments and mainly originated from sewage and fertilizers doc concentration was higher in the forest stream due to the organic matter transport from soil and wetlands the increased no3 n concentration in the settlement stream was due to wastewater inputs although their sources have been related to the different land use types the trends that doc and no3 n concentrations showed were similar in all catchments this indicates that climate and hydrological changes impact these nutrients pathways in similar ways the rising temperature explains such hydrological changes as decreases in the multi year flow mean active water storage in catchments shifts in snowmelt to earlier periods and high q fluctuations these changes impact nutrient transport and concentrations in receiving water bodies posing a risk to the implementation of the water protection measures and water strategies future study should focus on the long term monitoring of stable isotopes together with hydrochemical patterns to improve the water origin and water

7753,study region vltava river basin south bohemian region of the czech republic central europe study focus to understand the dynamics of nutrients nitrogen phosphorus and organic carbon in streams we combined hydrometeorological hydrochemical and isotopic data stable water and nitrate isotopes from three catchments with different predominant land use effects forest agricultural and settlement new hydrological insights for the study region our study underlines that current climate change and associated hydrological changes such as decrease in flow play an important role in the transport and dynamics of nutrients in the catchment we have found that due to the different origins and pathways individual nutrients had diverse behaviour patterns in streams and responded differently to changing climate hydrological patterns in streams became clear when systematic and continuous monitoring under a changing climate was applied highlighting the need for such data to better understand the impact of hydrological drivers particularly for long term dynamics in three studied catchments streamflow showed a decreasing trend in line with rising air temperature declining snow cover and increasing evapotranspiration time series analyses of nitrate concentrations revealed decreasing trends whereas dissolved organic carbon increased in all catchments regardless of land use long term trends of total phosphorus concentrations were positive in anthropogenically impacted streams stable nitrate isotopes indicated distinct nitrate sources and processes but also their seasonality in relation to

ponnou delaffon et al 2020 in both anthropogenically used and near natural catchments nutrient losses lead to surface water and groundwater pollution which can affect water quality thomas et al 2016 kop√°ƒçek et al 2016 mcdonough et al 2020 the influence of land use and nutrient sources on the export of nutrients to surface waters can be enhanced or on the contrary dampened by the hydrological regime and climate for example runoff from agricultural land areas promotes the release of nutrients and other pollutants through washing out of diffuse sources of n and p pollution ahearn et al 2005 delkash et al 2018 urban areas reduce land permeability leading to higher runoff volumes lower percolation and increased discharge of nutrient loads from non point pollution sources nie et al 2011 lee

of the ≈ô√≠mov reservoir which is located in the elbe basin in the headwaters of the vltava river for the analysis of the processes that currently control nutrient runoff from the landscape in this region as well as in other parts of central europe socio economic changes have occurred since the middle of the 20th century which significantly affected the composition of surface waters kop√°ƒçek et al 2017 vystavna et al 2017a znachor et al 2018 negative impacts on surface waters have been increasing since the 1950s as a result of changes in land use and accompanying activities in particular the intensification of agriculture with the consolidation of cultivated fields use of artificial fertilizers soil drainage increase in population and urbanized areas sewerage of settlements and intensive air pollution and deposition of acidifying compounds of sulphur and nitrogen surface water pollution peaked in the 1980s and after 1990 when the state controlled economic system in the country changed to a system with a market economy pollution decreased mainly thanks to the introduction of effective treatment of municipal and industrial wastewater a sharp decrease in the application of synthetic fertilizers primarily potassium and phosphorus fertilizers in agricultural production the transition to organic farming and effective desulphurization and reduction of atmospheric nitrogen emissions kop√°ƒçek et al 2012 2013 2021 hejzlar et al 2016 the rapid decrease in the intensity of surface water pollution from anthropogenic sources lasted for one decade and ended in the entire country and in the ≈ô√≠mov reservoir catchment at the beginning of the new millennium in the last twenty years the concentration of p and n in the inflows to the ≈ô√≠mov reservoir has changed little which is proven by direct analyses of the inflow into the reservoir and bioindicators monitored in the reservoir e g the isotopic composition of fish scales va≈°ek et al 2021 or changes in the phytoplankton

kop√°ƒçek et al 2021 which is the likely cause of the long term increase in doc concentration in this basin hejzlar et al 2003 znachor et al 2018 we used datasets of water quality indicators from the last two decades including nitrate no3 n total phosphorus tp and dissolved organic carbon doc in three catchments in the ≈ô√≠mov reservoir basin with different land uses mainly forest agricultural and urban but also a shorter time series of stable isotopes in the water molecule Œ¥ 18o Œ¥ 2h of h2o and stable nitrate isotopes Œ¥ 15n Œ¥ 18o of no3 for understanding nutrient dynamics the objectives of our study were to i demonstrate the effect of land use on hydrological and water chemistry in time ii understand the seasonal variation in water chemistry seasonality and its relation to flow iii assess the water origin and trace nutrient sources by coupling hydrochemical and isotopic data and iv discuss the role of hydrological and biogeochemical processes controlling nutrient dynamics the results of this study can be applicable to other catchments with similar land uses and can be used in river basin management to design land use strategies under a changing climate 2 materials and

influence on the water composition in the catchments even though arable land covers significant parts of the area in both the settlement and agricultural catchments the settlement stream is significantly affected by wastewater inputs and its catchment has a much higher population density and share of urban areas compared to the agricultural stream table 1 the studied catchments are located in the same temperate climate and have comparable climatic characteristics with an average annual temperature between 5 3 c and 8 5 c and an average annual precipitation between 669 and 1051

water areas agricultural and settlement catchments fig 1 and table 1 compared to the agricultural and forest catchments the population density in the settlement catchment was 10 times higher table 1 and the water quality of the stream was affected by wastewater inflows from nearby urban areas stormwater overflow from the local sewer system flowed into the settlement stream 1 km upstream of the sampling site the average elevation ranges from 546 lowest for the settlement catchment to 968 m a s l highest for the forest catchment table 1 the settlement and forest catchments located in the lower and upper parts of the ≈ô√≠mov reservoir catchment have relatively lower average terrain slopes than the large agricultural catchment where the average terrain slope is higher due to steep slopes in mountainous areas and deep valleys the bedrock has low permeability in all catchments table 1 and shallow aquifers predominate in the weathered zones of the bedrock hejzlar et al 2003 czech

ionic concentration in individual water samples kop√°ƒçek et al 2016 hydrogen and oxygen isotope analyses Œ¥ 18o and Œ¥ 2h in water samples were performed using off axis integrated cavity output laser spectroscopy oa icos los gatos research mountain view ca usa at the international atomic energy agency iaea isotope hydrology laboratory in vienna austria the samples were analysed in duplicates with each run performed on a different day and with a different instrument all oxygen and hydrogen analyses were referenced against internal laboratory standards calibrated against the primary reference material vienna standard mean ocean water v smow and values were reported in per mil as usual Œ¥ notation relative to v smow typical precisions were expressed as the 1 year variance of the internal control standards which were better than 0 1 and 0 5 for Œ¥ 18o and Œ¥ 2h respectively the water samples to be analysed for nitrate isotopes were prepared using the titanium iii chloride method altabet et al 2019 and analysed on an isoprime 100 continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometer at iaea precision and accuracy were 0 5 for both Œ¥ 15n no3 and Œ¥ 18o no3 2 3 data treatment and

performanceanalytics r package peterson et al 2014 principal component analysis pca was calculated using the factoextra r package kassambara and mundt 2020 and was used to separate the first two principal components pc1 and pc2 the seasonal mann kendall test was performed using the kendall r package mcleod 2015 and was selected due to the hydrological and hydrochemical data seasonality generalised additive models gam were created using geom smooth ggplot2 in r wickham 2009 with the option method gam the functional relationship was expressed as y s x bs cs where y is the estimated value of the variable x and s bs cs indicate the smooth function as a shrinkage version of the cubic regression splines the regression line was created using the method of lm specific discharge mm was calculated as a relation of water volume m3 to catchment area m2 calculations and statistical tests were performed using ordinary values without any transformation except for linear regressions between q and nutrient concentrations for which values were performed with a log log transformation on the data to limit the influence of skewed data distributions a conventional probability value p

conditions that occur during evaporation if d excess was less than 10 we considered the water to be evaporating dansgaard 1964 a dual Œ¥ 15n no3 vs Œ¥ 18o no3 linear regression plot was used to compare measured values to the range of representative values from common nitrate sources to help assess biogeochemical processes in water based on kendall 1998 2008 matiatos et al 2021 2 4 hydrological model for active water storage assessment long term data on the q of the agricultural stream mal≈°e river at po≈ôe≈°√≠n were obtained from the website of chmi available at https www chmi cz historicka data hydrologie daily temperature precipitation and snow depth were obtained from the nearest meteorological station in karlstift austria https www zamg ac at cms de klima klimauebersichten jahrbuch daily q in the streams was modelled based on a hydrological analogy with data from those close by continuously measured streams which yielded the best correlation with the measured discharges the modelled data were then fitted to the measured points by minimizing the residuals between the observed and modelled data a lumped 4 parameter model gr4j with two internal water tanks production and routing and with a snow component for the daily formation of rainfall runoff developed by perrin 2002 for rural catchments was used to construct a catchment water balance model that relates runoff to rainfall precipitation including snowpack and evapotranspiration using daily data the simulated amount of water in the production tank was considered to be representative of the active water storage in the catchment from which the runoff is formed see si 6 for more details 3 results 3 1 hydrological and water chemistry time series monthly average q in streams decreased from

insignificant decrease in the forest stream sen s slope 0 12 in all streams no3 n concentration decreased significantly but doc increased during the study period fig 3 tp concentration increased in the agricultural and settlement streams fig 3 ec increased in the forest and settlement streams and major ions showed diverse time trends table si 1 i calcium and magnesium concentrations increased significantly in all streams ii sodium also increased but this increase was not significant in the forest stream iii sulphate decreased in all streams while chloride increased significantly in the agricultural and settlement stream and decreased in the forest stream and iv silica increased in the forest and agricultural streams while it decreased significantly in the settlement stream 3 2

applied for all other ions fig si 1 the forest stream showed a higher average doc concentration 19 2 8 1 mg l 1 than the other streams fig 4 pca well distinguished streams from each other and from precipitation despite some slight overlap between the samples from the forest stream and precipitation fig 4 major ions as indicated by ec and in fig si 2 and no3 n were plotted close to each other and were distinctly separated from tp and doc which were also separated from each other fig 4 the first two principal components explained 70 of the variation nitrate concentration and ec and major ions showed the highest values in winter and spring and the lowest values in summer fig 5a and si 1 tp and doc showed an opposite seasonal trend with the highest concentrations in summer and the lowest in winter fig 5a doc showed significant positive correlations p 0 001 with q in all streams no3 n was positively correlated p 0 001 with q in the settlement and agricultural streams while tp was correlated with q positively p 0 001 in the agricultural streams and negatively p 0 001 in the forest stream 3 3 stable water and nitrate isotopes stable water isotopes for the forest stream were plotted directly on the global meteoric water line while those for agricultural and settlement streams were plotted below this line fig si 3a the mean Œ¥ 18o values were 9 8 in the forest 9 6 in agricultural and 8 6 in settlement streams fig si 3c the amplitude of seasonal Œ¥ 18o variation in the forest agricultural and settlement streams were 1 3 1 4 and 1 8 respectively with lowest values in february march and highest values in july august fig si 3c the d excess values fig si 3d showed seasonal trends opposite to those of Œ¥ 18o with highest average values in the forest stream 9 8 and the lowest in the settlement stream 5 6 the mean water transit time was less than one year in all streams fig si 3d with a minimum of 0 5 years in the settlement stream and a maximum of 0 9 years in the forest stream fig si 3d the average values of nitrate isotopes were lowest in the forest stream 2 4 and 3 3 for Œ¥ 15n no3 and Œ¥ 18o no3 respectively and highest in the settlement stream 12 1 and 2 8 for Œ¥ 15n no3 and Œ¥ 18o no3 respectively fig 6a nitrate isotope values in the forest stream plotted within the overlap of the published areas of nitrified synthetic fertilizers and rain soil nitrogen and manure septic waste kendall et al 2008 matiatos et al 2021 fig 6b the correlation between Œ¥ 15n no3 and Œ¥ 18o no3 in the forest stream was insignificant table si 2 nitrate isotope values in the agricultural stream overlapped value ranges representing nitrate originating from soil manure and septic waste and formed a Œ¥ 15n no3 vs Œ¥ 18o no3 regression line with a slope of 1 1 5 p 0 01 r 2 0 36 nitrate isotope values in the settlement stream mainly plotted in the value ranges representing manure and septic waste fig 6b forming a regression line between Œ¥ 15n no3 and Œ¥ 18o no3 with a slope of 1 2 5 p 0 01 r 2 0 58 in the forest and settlement streams Œ¥ 15n no3 values were higher during low q conditions in late summer autumn than in other seasons fig 7a c in the agricultural stream average Œ¥ 15n no3 and Œ¥ 18Œø no3 values decreased from the spring to the winter periods fig 7b however the seasonal patterns in all catchments were biased by the q peaks recorded in different seasons for example a similar temporal pattern of low Œ¥ 15ŒΩ ŒΩŒø3 values and high no3 n values was observed in february 2020 in the forest and agricultural and june july 2020 agricultural and settlement during high q conditions fig 7 the Œ¥ 18o no3 values showed more pronounced and diverse seasonal patterns with the highest variation in the forest and settlement streams and the lowest variation in the agricultural stream fig 7 the Œ¥ 18o no3 was significantly p 0 05 positively correlated with doc and no3 n in the forest stream table si 2 and significantly p 0 05 negatively correlated with doc in the settlement stream table si 2 the Œ¥ 15n no3 had a significantly p 0 05 negative correlation with no3 n in the forest and settlement streams table si 2 however in the settlement stream Œ¥ 15n no3 had also a significantly p 0 05 negative correlation with doc and tp table si 2 additionally Œ¥ 18Œø h2o was significantly positively correlated with doc in all streams table si 2 in the forest and agricultural streams Œ¥ 18Œø h2o was significantly negatively correlated with no3 n table si 2 regarding seasonality in the forest stream the relationship of Œ¥ 15n no3 with no3 n was positive in the cold period november april and negative in the warm period may november fig 7a the Œ¥ 18o no3 values generally followed no3 n seasonal patterns and displayed a gradual increase along with discharge during snowmelt in the forest stream fig 7a in the agricultural stream the Œ¥ 18o no3 values followed no3 n patterns during low q in autumn fig 7b in the settlement stream the Œ¥ 18o no3 seasonal variation followed a trend that was inverse to that of no3 n fig 7c 4 discussion the studied streams showed well distinguished hydrochemical compositions fig 5 we conclude that this pattern is due to the predominant land use and catchment area fig 1 the settlement stream exhibited higher no3 n and major ion concentrations compared to the forest and agricultural due to higher population density 595 inh km 2 in the settlement vs 36 and 0 inh km 2 in the agricultural and forest streams respectively and municipal wastewater inputs table 1 a higher contribution of sewage was also confirmed by a higher average Œ¥ 15ŒΩ ŒΩŒø3 value in settlement the average was 12 1 than in other streams average 8 fig 6 moreover the settlement stream had low discharge table 1 and thus low dilution of anthropogenic inputs the forest stream had higher average doc concentrations and differed from the settlement and agricultural streams by this variable fig 5a the higher doc can be explained by transport of doc from wetland soils on peat accumulations covering ca 20 of the forest catchment area wetland runoff is generally high in doc because anoxic conditions do not allow complete oxidation of organic matter to co2 musolff et al 2018 this is also supported by previous studies worldwide where wetlands in forested catchments are found to be a primary source of doc e g strohmeier et al 2013 nahlik and fennessy 2016 kop√°ƒçek et al 2018 despite the differences in land use and catchment size the streams showed similar trends of increasing doc concentrations and decreasing no3 n concentrations over time fig 3 and table si 1 additionally the catchments experienced a reduction in q particularly in anthropogenically impacted agricultural and settlement catchments fig 2 these changes are explained by meteorological dynamics such as rising air temperature and evapotranspiration that are observed in local table si 1 regional ministry of the environment of the czech republic 2015 and global scales ipcc 2021 these meteorological drivers directly affect changes in the snow regime less persistent snowpack reduction of the snow water equivalent in the czech republic jen√≠ƒçek et al 2021 and in many european catchments fontrodona et al 2018 additionally hydrological changes can be driven by variations in the north atlantic oscillation nao which strongly influences european weather and precipitation distribution resulting in the frequency of droughts and floods ipcc 2021 vystavna et al 2020b 2021b moreover the flow decline was mostly pronounced in the two anthropogenically impacted catchments fig 2 with less forest coverage fig 1 table 1 shorter water residence time fig si 3 and less active water storage fig si 5 in the forest catchment in contrast water is probably stored within the saturated and unsaturated zones in soil and wetlands significantly increase the water residence time as observed in other forested catchments dunn et al 2007 roa garcia and weiler 2010 therefore we believe that settlement and agricultural catchments probably drain faster even in short dry periods and but also recharge faster after rainfall this in turn impacts the nutrient sources and processes in the catchment particularly a decrease in flow can lead to the decrease of the sediments transport from the catchment and in contrast an increase in flow can lead to an increase in the soil erosion and more intensive transport of nutrients from the catchment dunkerley and brown 1999 we even observed that no3 n concentrations increased and occasionally exceeded the world health organization who threshold value of 11 3 mg l 1 no3 n year 2017 who 2017 fig 6 during flow peaks the nutrient dynamics response to flow changes was also observed in a previous study vystavna et al 2017a the decrease in nitrate concentrations over time in all catchments fig 3 can be explained by the decrease in acid atmospheric emissions and reduced nitrate export from the soil kop√°ƒçek et al 2012 the air temperature increases along with unchanged or lower precipitation amounts table si 1 in parallel to increased evaporation probably led to decreasing soil moisture in the agricultural and settlement catchments causing less topsoil flushing and higher accumulation of nitrate which washed out only during snowmelt and or after summer storm runoff events fig 6 as observed in other studies as well kato et al 2009 vystavna et al 2021a increasing nitrate values were observed together with decreasing Œ¥ 15ŒΩ ŒΩŒø3 values in the settlement stream table si 2 implying that the increase in no3 n concentration could be related to an increased contribution from a source with lower Œ¥ 15ŒΩ ŒΩŒø3 values such as ammonium synthetic fertilizers and or increased nitrification conversion of ammonium to nitrate of the original nitrate source matiatos et al 2021 in the agricultural and forest stream the no3 n concentration increased mainly with q in april may fig 7 this was possibly related to the release of nitrate mainly derived from soil nitrification which was washed off with snowmelt mayer et al 2002 ohte et al 2010 vystavna et al 2021a like in the study of matiatos et al 2021 in our study as well high Œ¥ 18Œø ŒΩŒø3 values coincided with elevated nitrate e g february 2020 in fig 7a april 2020 in fig 7b which was shown to be caused by an increased proportion of nitrate originating from atmospheric deposition in the forest stream soil nitrification can be traced by the depletion of 15n values with increasing no3 n kendall 1998 kendall et al 2008 fig 7 overall given that the terrestrial nitrate sources in the forest stream are generally constant throughout the year temporal variations of Œ¥ 15ŒΩ ŒΩŒø3 values should rather be attributed to hydrology atmospheric inputs and biogeochemical processes mayer et al 2002 in the mixed land use catchments settlement and agricultural table 1 fig 1 increasing nitrate concentrations and decreasing Œ¥ 15ŒΩ ŒΩŒø3 and Œ¥ 18Œø no3 were recorded under high q in summer fig 7 this was likely attributed to increased wash out of low Œ¥ 15n sources such as non nitrate synthetic fertilizers and nh4 with precipitation the positive slope of the regression lines of Œ¥ 18Œø no3 vs Œ¥ 15ŒΩ no3 in the agricultural and settlement catchments fig 6 and significant negative correlation between Œ¥ 15ŒΩ no3 and no3 n in these anthropogenically impacted streams table si 2 indicates possible denitrification however different positions of the regression lines show that the responsible nitrate sources and or their mixture were different fig 6 for example the agricultural stream was characterized by lower Œ¥ 18Œø no3 than the settlement stream which could be due to the lower degree of denitrification that occurred as the water passed through the catchment e g due to lack of organic matter the forest catchment was characterized by Œ¥ 15ŒΩ no3 values characteristic of rain and soil passage while the settlement catchment Œ¥ 15ŒΩ no3 values fell within the range of soil manure and sewage passage and were too high to be derived from fertilizers or rain fig 6 similar patterns of nitrate sources and or their mixture were observed for the larger slapy vystavna et al 2017a and for the seversky donets vystavna et al 2017b catchments in contrast to no3 n the concentrations of doc showed an increasing trend in all catchments the strong relationship between doc and q in all streams fig 5b demonstrate the hydrological control over doc transport we suggest that doc is mostly mobilized from soils at the interface between terrestrial and aquatic systems as shown in other studies e g de wit et al 2021 musolff et al 2018 hejzlar et al 2003 and worrall and burt 2007 the increasing air temperatures can lead to faster mineralisation of soil organic matter and soil weathering which also promotes growth in doc concentrations musolff et al 2018 another indication of this is the increase in an increase in geogenic ca2 that often accompanies an increase in doc concentration table si 1 vystavna et al 2020a moreover reducing so4 2 deposition from acid rain and increasing soil ph increases the solubility of doc and facilitates its transport into streams ekstrom et al 2011 kop√°ƒçek et al 2012 raike et al 2012 brag√©e et al 2015 schmidt et al 2021 2022 hydrological transport of doc is also confirmed by the significant positive correlation between Œ¥ 18Œø h2o and doc in all streams table si 2 with higher concentrations of doc during the warm season when stream water is isotopically enriched similar to doc the tp concentrations also increased but only in the agricultural and settlement catchments table si 1 in these catchments possible sources of tp include animal waste manure artificial and organic fertilizers leaf litter and treated sewage vystavna et al 2017a the p deposited on the soil and weathered in the soil is transported to the stream during high q events which is reflected in the positive correlation of tp and q in the agricultural stream farming practices and the amount of rainfall can thus increase tp concentrations vystavna et al 2017a high precipitation events during the growing season can also cause surface and subsurface runoff from agricultural land to streams increasing tp nitrate doc and ion concentrations and negatively affecting water quality elser and bennett 2011 gruber n galloway 2008 hejzlar et al 2003 therefore these increasing trends may be due to more frequent changes in soil moisture and the faster mineralisation and weathering of soil in the warmer and drier climate of recent decades the czech republic s average temperature has been rising faster than the world average over the last two decades and this observation indicates both a notable increase in the number of days with high rainfall intensity in the past few decades ministry of the environment the czech republic 2015 znachor et al 2018 ipcc 2021 as well as a decrease in snow cover and snow water equivalent jen√≠ƒçek et al 2021 climate simulations show that these trends are likely to continue until the end of the 21st century ipcc 2021 based on this prediction we concluded that the trends in doc no3 n and tp in all catchments will also continue and might even exacerbate with stronger seasonal variations the high seasonality in nutrient loads will impact downstream reservoirs and thus drinking water production 5 summary and conclusions doc no3 n and tp behaved differently in the three studied catchments due to their distinct sources related to the land use for example tp concentrations increased in anthropogenically impacted catchments and mainly originated from sewage and fertilizers doc concentration was higher in the forest stream due to the organic matter transport from soil and wetlands the increased no3 n concentration in the settlement stream was due to wastewater inputs although their sources have been related to the different land use types the trends that doc and no3 n concentrations showed were similar in all catchments this indicates that climate and hydrological changes impact these nutrients pathways in similar ways the rising temperature explains such hydrological changes as decreases in the multi year flow mean active water storage in catchments shifts in snowmelt to earlier periods and high q fluctuations these changes impact nutrient transport and concentrations in receiving water bodies posing a risk to the implementation of the water protection measures and water strategies future study should focus on the long term monitoring of stable isotopes together with hydrochemical patterns to improve the water origin and water

7754,study region this study was conducted in robe town ethiopia study focus in this the pcswmm was used to investigate the potential effects of climate change and land use change on the peak flow magnitude and efficiency of stormwater drainage systems in managing urban flooding four simulation scenarios were developed to demonstrate the changes in the flooding volume and adequacy of existing systems moreover the effectiveness of three low impact developments rain barrels rain gardens and a combination of both practices as a mitigation strategy in reducing flooding volume were investigated new hydrological insights for region the trend of landuse change showed that the increased peak flow and flooding volume of junctions increased from 45 13 to 68 72 m3 s and 35 418 50 106 106 ltr respectively due to the imperviousness increasing from 10 to 70 similarly in response to climate change the simulated peak runoff increased by 46 9 34 8 and 37 5 for rca4 racmo22t and remo2009 respectively this findings showed that if the current landuse and climate changes continue in the coming years the study area threatened by the increased flooding due to the drainage systems will fail to accommodate increased peak runoff the present study suggests the adopted lids can be significantly reduced the effects of flooding problems in the town keywords climate change landuse change urban flooding lid pcswmm data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction urban flooding is one of the natural disaster that affects the environment human societies life and financial damage in different parts of the world stormwater drainage systems can be constructed to collect and convey the urban catchment stormwater to receiving water bodies while ensuring minimal damages fu and butler 2014 mcdonald and naughton 2019 the efficient of stormwater management systems however can be affected by an urban growth and changes in rainfall intensity due to climate conditions according to study by neupane et al 2021 and naje and zwain 2022 the drainage systems may have been designed without a detail analysis of both urbanization and climate change and this has been identified as one of the major causes of flooding in urban areas in the future the urban development in cities affects the runoff coefficients which can cause significant increases the peak stormwater and vulnerabilities to flooding risks due to the construction of residential commercial areas public buildings and roads the urbanization related change in runoff coefficient will have an impact on the stormwater drainage systems design parameters such as conduit flow flooding volume velocity profile and construction costs abd elhamid et al 2020 guan et al 2015 urban hydrological process have been extensively studied recent studies including those by huong and pathirana 2013 kong et al 2017 shanableh et al 2018 and haile and worku 2019 have noted that the runoff coefficient is affected globally because the paved surface areas increased as a result of urban development activities for the myponga catchment in south australia akhter and hewa 2016 simulated that the mean annual runoff would increase by 50 and 320 respectively as the imperviousness increased by 10 and 70 huong and pathirana 2013 predicted a similar increase in runoff of 21 as a result of a 55 increase in urban areas according to shanableh et al 2018 the study area s infrastructure and transportation are affected by flooding problems and the most of the existing drainage networks have been flooded the variation in the rainfall intensity with climate change is among the most important factors that affect the adequacy of drainage network assuming that the climate will remain stationary in the future various stormwater drainage facilities are typically designed using historical data climate change however is expected to have an impact on the future peak flow as well as the characteristics of extreme rainfall such as intensity duration and frequency moreover the drainage networks that were built without taking future precipitation patterns into account are not accommodate the increased flooding volume alamdari 2018 berggren et al 2014 thakali et al 2016 in a similar wang et al 2017 halsn√¶s and kaspersen 2018 and padulano et al 2021 studied the effects climate change on the performance of stormwater management systems and highlighted as the systems failed due to insufficient or overflowing capacity to carry the future projected peak stormwater rainfall prediction is essential for simulating future peak stormwater and managing future urban floods at the local scale several researchers conducted studies to improve the prediction of daily rainfall amounts using meteorology data from various countries furthermore researchers used data mining machine learning and soft computing techniques to improve the accuracy of daily rainfall and wave height prediction according to the findings the rainfall prediction process has shifted from data mining to soft computing approaches such as artificial neural network adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system regression analysis and random forest liyew and melese 2021 sadeghifar et al 2022 a few studies examined the combined effects of urbanization and climate change on urban runoff and reported that effective stormwater drainage systems considered both scenarios will needed to manage the risks of urban flooding in dublin city ireland willuweit et al 2016 used a dynamic urban water simulation model and found that the combined scenario increased the monthly runoff by 57 in addition philip mzava et al 2021 neupane 2018 and zhou et al 2021 investigated the impacts of both impacts landuse and climate change to evaluate the functionality of existing urban drainage networks and found that almost all systems failed to accommodate the flooding volume moreover to manage urban flooding it is critical to identify the uncertainty in flood magnitude due to simulation lama et al 2022 quantified flow velocity uncertainties by comparing the estimated flow velocity with the experimental measurements value the mitigation techniques are required to manage increased flooding while sustaining the functionality of existing urban drainage networks low impact development lid practices e g rainfall gardens green roofs bio retention infiltration trenches rain barrels vegetative swales and pervious pavement are flood management techniques that can be implemented at both the local and watershed scales fiori and volpi 2020 line et al 2012 luan et al 2017 furthermore lama et al 2020 evaluated the flow resistance in the channel using the partially vegetated and found that partially vegetated by rigid and emergent riparian plants can resist flow and flow velocity in the channel however the extent and frequency of urban flood risks that affect urban residents livelihoods are not the same under landuse and climate change effects according to investigated by different previous researchers poor urban drainage system planning and lack of hydrologic hydraulic efficiency consideration in developing countries including ethiopian similarly contribute to urban floods as a result the numerous towns cities of ethiopia affected by urban flooding problems many times for example the community of dire dawa adama addis ababa and robe have frequently complained about inadequate drainage systems during the rainy season these cities infrastructure and daily socioeconomic conditions are all regularly impacted birhanu et al 2016 haile and worku 2019 jemberie and melesse 2021 in the town of robe the stormwater drainage infrastructure frequently fails one of the most severe cases can be observed at robe town were the happening of flooding repeatedly many areas in the town have been inundated flooding has disrupted the community s daily activities as well as the homes of several residents to alleviate the these problem up to date analysis of landuse and climate change as well as adaption of effective low impact developments such as rain barrels rain gardens and a combination of both rain barrels and rain gardens should be required therefore this study is conducted to assess the potential effects of urbanization and climate change on peak stormwater magnitude and performance of current stormwater drainage systems using the personal computer storm water management model pcswmm 2 study area and data sources in this study the robe town was chosen as the study area 39056 00 e to 4006 40 e 705 20 n to 7010 40 n it situated in southeastern ethiopia in the oromia regional state the town covers a total of 6680 ha with an average elevation of 2565 m fig 1 the maximum and minimum annual precipitation from 1989 to 2020 in the town are 651 mm and 1309 mm respectively the stormwater of the study area drain into shaya river in the upper of genale dawa basin most of the rainfall falls in the wet season between july and november in order to assess the potential impacts of change in climate and urbanization this study required both spatial and temporal data sets the national meteorological agency of ethiopia provided daily rainfall datasets 1980 2020 for five meteorological stations in and near robe town that had a good record few missing data to evaluate the effects of future extreme rainfall on the drainage systems future projected rainfall data of fine spatial resolution 0 44 x0 44 global climate models were downloaded from cordex africa database via earth system grid federation esgf the landuse landcover masterplan data and sewer network data are obtained from robe town municipal city office a soil shapefile fao shape file was taken from the ministry of water and energy of ethiopia mowe the soil of the study area was extracted from shapefile format soil data and then projected using wgs 1984 utm zone 37 n the initial moisture deficit hydraulic conductivity and the suction head of the soil were estimated from literature based on the site soil types parnas et al 2021 a 12 5 m x 12 5 m spatial resolution dem was obtained from the alaska satellite facility asf database https asf alaska edu 3 methods it was the objective of this work assess the potential impacts of change in climate and urban development on the efficiency of stormwater drainage systems therefore to meet the aims of the study we i assessed the the hydrological process of the town based on the future projected rainfall from rcms ii quantified the effect of urbanization on the peak stormwater and adequacy of drainage systems iii simulated based on the combined impact of urbanization and climate change using the calibrated pcswmm model and iv evaluated the effectiveness of selected low impact development to minimize the amplified flooding risks from the town the simulated peak stormwater based landuse landcover in 2020 and the observed rainfall data was considered as the baseline to evaluate the percentage change in the future condition the used methods in this work is shown in fig 2 the details of each section are discussed below 3 1 climate change projections climate change influenced by the greenhouse gas emissions too has adverse effects on urban hydrology the variation in the rainfall intensity due to climate change is one of the adverse effect heavily affected to the urban stormwater management we considered five gcm such as ec earth mpi es lr canesm2 hadgem2 es and cnrm cm5 to assess the potential effects of climate change on flooding magnitude and drainage system performance chen et al 2012 mendlik and gobiet 2016 the outputs of regional climate models rcms racmo22t remo2009 rca4 racmo22t and rca4 were deriven from the global climate models under various greenhouse gas emission scenarios we projected the rcm outputs for two representative concentration pathways rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios in the near future 2020 2040 and the mid future 2041 2070 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 were chosen from among the four ipcc rcps because they represent medium and high emission scenarios respectively zickfeld et al 2013 numerous endeavors have been made to examine the performance of climate models in simulating various climate variables e g precipitation gu et al 2014 sun et al 2021a the climate models output data for the study area were evaluated using statistical evaluation such as percentage of bias root mean squared error and coefficient of variation rmse and coefficient of variation cv was used to assess rcm performance sun et al 2021b the projected precipitation data of remo2009 rca4 and racmo22t were used in this study because these climate models perform better results than other selected climate models in terms of bias cv and rmse 3 2 climate model bias correction after downloading precipitation data for each rcm netcdf network common data form files were extracted and bias corrected downscaling from rcms to urban catchment scales are needed because high resolution of temporal and spatial data is required to analyse the urban catchments willems et al 2012 then when compared to observed data the projected climate models output contain significant biases that restrict the use of the projected rainfall data of climate models as direct input for assessment of climate change impacts on the urban hydrological processes fang et al 2015 alamdari 2018 different software tools are available to downscale and bias correct climate data as suggested by existing tools cannot always perform the necessary processing due to time taking techniques cmhydr tool was used to extract and bias correct rcms rainfall data zhang et al 2018 bias correction was applied for downscaled future data using the observed data from 1989 to 2020 the missing daily observed rainfall was first filled using the normal ratio method and its consistency and outliers were then examined using the double mass curve and the grubbs and beck g b test respectively hamed and rao 2019 nadiatul adilah and hannani 2021 for the future periods 2020 2040 and 2041 2070 the bias corrected rainfall data of the climate predictors from the rracmo22t remo and rca4 simulations were used to develop the idf relations and estimate the design storms for the study area 3 3 derivation of intensity duration frequency idf hydrological study in a small urban catchment requires rainfall data at smaller spatial and temporal scales depending on the purpose for urban flooding management studies it is necessary to have rainfall data on hourly sub hourly time scales as suggested by ewea et al 2018 and krvavica and rubiniƒá 2020 there are several rain gauges that have been in use for many years in most regions although the most of them record daily rainfall whereas hourly or sub hourly data recorders are less common in developing nations like ethiopia due to absence of short duration rainfall studies dealing with climate change impacts on stormwater management systems are particularly challenging willems et al 2012 thus to address this limitation several researchers were developed different empirical reduction equations to disaggregate daily rainfall data to short duration for different regions around the world such as hershfeld equation 1961 for the usa bell equation 1969 indian meteorological department and modified indian meteorological department palaka et al 2016 al mamun et al 2018 nwaogazie et al 2021 although some of these equations have demonstrated adequate accuracy the disadvantage is that either the calculation of short duration rainfall or the evaluation of the parameters involved is complex allard and bourotte 2015 in this study the indian meteorological department formula was used because compared to other it is widely used and simple to estimate the rainfall depths of hourly scale which is 1 p t p 24 x t 24 1 3 where pt mm is the rainfall depth for the duration of t hour p24 maximum annual daily rainfall mm and t the time duration in hours for the required rainfall depth in hours for the rainfall data generalized pareto s distribution provided a better fit than the other distribution based on kolmogorov smirnov anderson darling and chi square test of goodness of fit gado et al 2021 mamoon and rahman 2017 the rainfall intensity is estimated using best fitted distribution i e generalized pareto s eq 1 for the baseline and future period are used for development of idf curves which is shown in fig 3 2 p t Œæ Œ± k Œª t k where pt is t year rainfall depth mm Œæ Œ± and k was the estimated parameters the rainfall intensity mm hr for each return period with respect to corresponding rainfall duration is estimated using pt td where td is rainfall duration the design storm is derived for different return periods from idf curves the design storm design is then used as input to pcswmm for the following time periods ii baseline period 1990 2020 with landuse landcover from 2020 ii projected climate change 2020 2050 with the projected landuse from 2035 and iii projected climate change 2020 2050 with the projected landuse from 2020 in this study the simulated value for the baseline and each projected scenario are compared as mentioned previously nguyen et al 2010 and berggren et al 2014 have assessed the accuracy of different design storm models used the chicago design storm is the most accurate in the estimation of peak stormwater for urban catchment fig 3 shows the design storm for 1990 2020 and 2020 2040 period based rcms projected changing climatic conditions 3 4 landuse change analysis urbanization is expected to substantially alter the surface hydrological characteristics may include decreases infiltration and increased surface runoff associated with impervious surface areas kong et al 2017 therefore to evaluate the impact of landuse change on the urban flooding and efficient of drainage systems the current 2020 and future developed landuse 2035 are utilized in this study the future landuse of the town that was prepared by the oromia urban planning institute and obtained from robe town municipality city the cad format lulc data were first converted to a gis shapefile dataset and the projected coordinate system was set to a wgs 1984 utm zone 37 n according to the projected land use plan for the robe town 2015 2035 the current landuse landcover will be changed to developed urban area by 2035 from 2020 2035 there was a 25 38 increase in imperviousness in the study area among them the residential area will account for the largest portion of the total area 3767 5 56 4 followed by the governmental building 1022 15 3 and roads 1416 2 21 2 in order to assess the separate effects of landuse change on the peak stormwater and efficiency of drainage systems the percentage of impervious was determined from the landuse data for 2020 and 2035 and separately input with the design storm estimated from observed rainfall data however to simulate the combined effects of landuse and climate change the imperviousness estimated from the future landuse 2035 was used with the design storm of three rcms 3 5 application of pcswmm the personnel computer storm water management model pcswmm is a dyanamic model for simulating rainfall runoff for a single event or long term period in urban areas as suggested ahiablame and shakya 2016 akhter and hewa 2016 pcswmm was chosen for this study based on the following criteria i it generates peak stormwater based on the rain gauge and inputted physical parameters of sub catchment i e area of sub catchment overland flow width overland slope the ratio of imperviousness roughness of coefficient of pervious cover etc ii it is a dynamic rainfall runoff model and can simulate both the event and continuous events iii it can simulate hydrological hydraulic responses to impacts of landuse and climate change iv it is suitable in an urban catchment area less than 100 km2 and v it has built in sensitivity based radio tuning calibration srtc tool the whole study area is divided into 53 sub catchments in pcswmm and each sub catchment requires its own set of estimated parameters akhter and hewa 2016 to divide the sub catchment 118 junctions were identified first based on the topography and road layout the sub catchments were then delineated with the arc hydro extension in arc map 10 3 fig 4 with this division the basic parameters of each sub catchment such as area width average slope percentage of impervious area and others could be derived from dem landuse and soil shapefile the properties of nodes x y coordinates and invert elevation maximum junction depth and links conduits length and depth conduit inlet and outlet were collected via field measurements these properties were converted into shapefile using arc gis 10 3 and then imported into pcswmm with sub catchment physical parameters and design storms of the rain gauge lee et al 2017 dynamic flow routing was selected from three types of flow routing in this study because it accounts for channel storage flow reversal and entrance exit losses in this study the green ampt infiltration model was used because it is based on physical parameters that are related to the town s soil characteristics 3 6 model calibration and validation the model was required since a various of parameters was estimated from various data sources and these parameters affect the model output with different weights resulting in different uncertainty gao et al 2020 to solve this the sensitiveity analysis was investigated to identify which inputted parameters using local sensitivity analysis technique mancipe munoz et al 2014 the local method was selected because it is easy compared to global technique to select the sensitive parameters one parameter was changed at a time while the other parameters remain unchanged padulano et al 2016 pcswmm s sensitivity based radio tuning calibration srtc tool allow the user to select the initial values of sensitive parameters assign the uncertainty values by comparing the observed and simulated channel runoff depth to evaluate the performance of model niyonkuru et al 2018 perin et al 2020 as shown in fig 5 srtc has ability to select sensitive parameters and adjust the value of inputted parameters to minimize the difference between the model output and measured runoff depth in urban areas particularly in ethiopian cities and towns it is difficult to get gauged flow data which makes it challenge to perform a robust calibration and validation of the model similar challenges happened in other areas when several studies attempted to calibrate the simulation model however a many of earlier researchers tested the stormwater models manually and automatically using the short term observed data we therefore adopted suggestions provided by yim et al 2016 basnayaka 2012 and perin et al 2020 in this work the runoff depth event was collected from field observation on rainy days for this rainfall events and their corresponding runoff depth in the conduit were recorded from 10th june to 15th september 2021 at every five minutes intervals near to madda walabu university x 610474 y 788610 and siko mando hotel x 611589 y 786817 this two stations were selected because the most of runoff from conduits was collected therein and near to the systems outfalls the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse the root mean square error to the standard deviation ratio rsr and the coefficient of determination r2 was selected to evaluate the model performance niazi et al 2017 4 results and discussion 4 1 sensitivity analysis calibration and validation the sensitivity analysis is performed to select and adjust the model sensitive parameters after the user defined uncertainty values or rankings were assigned for each parameter table 1 by comparing the agreement between the simulated and observed runoff depth the sensitive parameters were systematically adjusted using srtc to obtain fitted parameter values within the limited range calibration started by changing the impervious ratio while keeping the initial values of all other parameters in this case the simulated value is greater than the observed value so the value of imperviousness was reduced by 25 from its initial value to reduce the simulated value the width of the sub catchment is the second sensitive parameter that is adjusted using the calibrated imperviousness values similarly calibration was performed for each parameter one by one by comparing the simulated and observed runoff values on the graphical plot with the efficiency criteria values the final efficiency criteria results after the calibration in the selected conduits were r2 0 5 nse 0 5 and psr 0 7 niazi et al 2017 neupane et al 2021 this result shows that the difference between the simulated and observed runoff depth values was closely matched and the values of r2 nse and psr were within acceptable ranges when the values of the sensitive parameters presented in table 1 were changed from their initial values the imperviousness width and slope were found to be the most sensitive parameters that affected the model outputs while the average slope was found to be the least sensitive parameter suction head and saturated hydraulic conductivity were noticed to be less sensitive parameters estimated from the study area s soil shapefile this results is consistent with the previous study findings of ahiablame and shakya 2016 and akhter and hewa 2016 once the model is calibrated it needs to be validated the chosen event for validation is taken from the conduit of c86 figs 6 and 7 shows the graphical comparison of observed and simulated runoff depth for both calibrated and validated it can be noted that the pcswmm model has an acceptable accuracy for the study area as evident from the goodness of fit indices values the model fits well for rainfall runoff simulation in the robe town 4 2 impacts of landuse change on the efficiency of stormwater drainage systems the results of future landuse analysis show that the robe town experienced significant developed compared to the current landuse the greatest change will be the conversion of open area to impervious surface as a result of rapid urbanization as shown in table 2 increasing impervious surface area from 68 5 to 83 65 within 20 years 2020 2035 results in peak flow increasing from 45 1 m3 s to 68 72 m3 s this indicated that the construction of residential commercial public buildings and roads in 2035 will affect the runoff coefficient resulting significant increases in stormwater and flooding volume this increase is linear with the flooding volume and the number of flooded junctions which indicates vurnerable to flooding risks as presented in table 2 the simulation results showed that the total flooding increased from 35 418 to 50 106 106 ltr when compared to the baseline this is consistent with the findings of the abd elhamid et al 2020 and marhaento et al 2018 studies which found that rapid urbanization increased flooding volume and the number of flooded junctions while decreasing infiltration rates knowing flood locations and flooding types is very important to provide a technical solution for experts and decision makers in order to identify problems in the system and evaluate proposed solution the pcswmm can identify the location and type of flooding in the town based the flooding flow rate at junctions the simulation results show that 32 junctions 27 1 of a total of 119 are flooded however if the study area s impervious surface area increases further in the future 56 junctions 47 5 of a total of 119 are expected to be flooded as suggested by hassan et al 2017 based on the flooding flow rate on junctions 18 5 28 6 34 and 18 9 of junctions are were slightly flooded fairly flooded highly flooded and very highly flooded respectively the increase in urban flooding could be a result of the increase in imperviousness is expected in 2035 and to a decrease in infiltration rate under future scenarios of land use many areas of town were inundated as a result particularly near robe square and the heavy flood hampered people s movement and disrupted the transportation system for hours as evidence fig 8 depicts a flooded area near the town s roundabout moreover flooding problems will may affects the resident s house damages property and infrastructure this caused problems in a several residents homes as well as disruptions in people s daily lives and the town s economy hu et al 2020 reported an increase in impervious surfaces in beijing s central area leading to an increase in flooding risks in the area which is consistent with the findings of this study high flooding risks are expected in the urban cenetr as a result of future urban growth 4 3 impacts of climate change on the efficiency of stormwater drainage systems in order to quantify the impacts of the projected climate change scenarios on the peak storms and flooding in the robe town the future design storms were derived from the idf curves of three rcms the idf curves for the future show a significant increase in design storm peak runoff increased by 46 9 34 8 and 37 5 respectively in rca4 racmo22t and remo2009 when compared to the baseline scenario during near future scenarios fig 9 in contrast the mid future climate change scenario resulted in peak runoff of 120 39 146 36 and 151 6 m3 s respectively due to the projected rainfall intensity by remo2009 rca4 and racmo22t which is greater than the near future scenario in the study area the significant change in rainfall intensity under climate change conditions predicted by climate model predictors increased the severity and risks of urban flooding in the study area this happened as a result of existing drainage systems designed based on historical idf relationships taking stationary in the future period furthermore the simulated peak runoff due to the rca4 climate model is expected to be higher because the design storms estimated from rca4 idf curves are higher than the other two climate models according to the findings it is reasonable to conclude that the significant changes in peak stormwater and flooding volume with respect to the current period are dependent on the type climate models rainfall duration return period and periods as presented in the previous study shahabul alam and elshorbagy 2015 degaetano and castellano 2017 the impacts of change on the magnitude of flooding and the adequacy of existing drainage systems are not the same under all selected climate models when compared to the baseline the total flooded junctions increased by 43 5 48 1 and 62 7 respectively under the climate models remo2009 racmo22t and rca4 a 64 4 are flooded junctions according to a simulation of the drainage system considering ensemble climate furthermore the simulation results show that as climate changes the flooding volume of junctions increased from 44 028 to 70 560 106 ltr these findings indicated that an increase in flooding volume and flooded junctions when future rainfall is altered due to climate change babaei et al 2018 in support of that hossain et al 2020 reported that the volume of flooding and the number of flooded junctions increased by 47 and 48 respectively as a result of climate change in like manner hassan et al 2017 reported a 47 increase in flooding as a result of climate change overall the findings revealed that the drainage system will be unable to collect and safely convey peak stormwater from the town as a result of climate change 4 4 combined impact of landuse and climate change on urban flooding to assess the combined impact of landuse and climate change the calibrated pcswmm is run with the future landuse and projected climate scenarios for period 2020 2040 during 2020 2040 the simulated peak stormwater is 162 9 144 5 and 186 8 m3 s under combined landuse and climate change conditions using the racmo22t remo and rca4 climate models respectively furthermore when the future landuse was simulated with racmo22t remo and rca4 the flooding volume increased by 63 5 74 1 and 83 9 for the periods 2041 2070 respectively as the percentage of the urban area increases with climate change the high flood magnitude will be expected the urban center from welmel sub city to roundabout is completely flooded when the future imperviousness is combined with the predicted rainfall of racmo22t remo and rca4 the flooding volume of junctions is will rose to 65 849 106 61 630 106 and 72 954 106 ltr respectively the results of this study shown the flooding magnitude will very high and might even enter properties causing damage to property and infrastructure furthermore the expected flooding will disrupt community activities causing property and infrastructure damage this was consistent with the findings of saraswat et al 2016 naje and zwain 2022 and wang et al 2017 examined the effects of both climate variability and land use change in the china catchment and discovered that the combined scenario influenced the hydrological response more strongly than the separate scenarios to minimize the flooding risks in urban areas the efficient stormwater management systems should be redesigned considering the potential effects of both climate change and urbanization as noted that by thakali et al 2016 and binesh et al 2019 4 5 mitigation option to reduce urban flooding flooding in the study area is caused by separate climate and landuse scenario as well as combined scenario the mitigation option is required to manage the increased flooding from the town and continued functionality of existing urban drainage networks thus three types of lids rain barrels rain gardens and a combination of both rain barrels and rain gardens were applied to reduce significantly flooding in a most flooded area when simulated with racmo22t remo and rca4 a rain garden reduced stormwater by up to 26 5 31 2 and 32 8 respectively however in comparison to without lids a rain barrel reduced 8 2 33 1 12 7 43 6 and 8 2 33 1 of the total flooding volume however the combination of both lids practices can further reduce peak runoff zhu and chen 2017 luan et al 2019 flooding can be reduced by implemented lids by 19 2 32 6 and 13 9 25 4 under landuse scenarios of 2020 and 2035 respectively in the future as the percentage of impervious surface area increases due to climate change the implementation of lids with an adequate drainage network will be required likewise most earlier studies have revealed that the percentage of significant reduction of various low impact development approaches is not the same huang et al 2014 hua et al 2020 bai et al 2018 4 6 uncertainty in peak flow in order to manage urban flooding it is critical to identify the uncertainty in flood magnitude due to urban climate and urbanisation impact fig 9 shows the variation uncertainty in peak flow under various scenarios changes in peak runoff from the baseline scenario were calculated and compared to further quantify the independent impacts of landuse and climate on simulation results as shown in table 3 when considering landuse and climate change the percentage change in peak stormwater was estimated to be 47 84 and 53 47 respectively for the future scenario it can be observed that when compared to urbanization the effect of climate change on peak runoff is more profound similarly poelmans et al 2011 and akter et al 2018 in belgium found that climate change was more likely to cause a larger change in peak flows than the urban growth scenarios 5 conclusions pcswmm is a dynamic rainfall runoff model which is widely used to assess the potential effects of landuse and climate change on the efficiency of urban stormwater drainage systems in this study projected rainfall data from three rcms remo2009 rca4 and racmo22t and landuse data 2020 and 2035 were incorporated into the model the srtc tool was used to perform the sensitivity analysis calibration and validation of the pcswmm the local sensistivity analysis technique was performed to identify the sensitive parameters and the results show that the ratio of imperviousness area manning s roughness coefficient and depth of depression storage are very sensitive parameters that have a significant impact on peak runoff and flooding volume the results of goodness of fit indices values revealed the pcswmm model had a good accuracy for simulation of rainfall runoff process under landuse and climate change in the robe town the land use change with loss of pervious surface area can increase peak stormwater flooding volume and number of flooded junctions according to simulation results 52 94 of existing drainage systems will be flooded as a result of urban growth stormwater will be expected to be higher in future period due to reduced infiltration caused by surface armoring in urban areas in addition to landuse climate change has increased the volume of flooding in the study area causing infrastructure damage and interfering with community activities a comparison of observed and projected idf curves under changing climate scenarios shows that flooding volume increases by 52 48 6 and 62 7 for racmo22t remo and rca4 respectively it is clear that increase in design storm in the near future and mid future has a significant impact on stormwater and simulation time combined change in land use and climate increased the peak stormwater up to 52 1 and magnitude of flooding up to 67 4 more compared the baseline condition this indicates that the study area will be the worst with flooding condition due to combined scenario increased impervious surfaces and climate change an inadequate drainage systems cannot accommodate to convey the peak flooding before design period as result of variation in rainfall intensity and imperviousness increased during the rainy season the town is frequently wracked by flooding problems in particular flooding has severely impacted the center of the city knowing the types of flooding from the junctions and locations of flooding is critical for accurately identifying flood problems stormwater management systems built in robe town should be redesigned to handle future flood events as a result this study is expected to provide decision makers with management practises to identify urban flooding problems funding the authors

7754,study region this study was conducted in robe town ethiopia study focus in this the pcswmm was used to investigate the potential effects of climate change and land use change on the peak flow magnitude and efficiency of stormwater drainage systems in managing urban flooding four simulation scenarios were developed to demonstrate the changes in the flooding volume and adequacy of existing systems moreover the effectiveness of three low impact developments rain barrels rain gardens and a combination of both practices as a mitigation strategy in reducing flooding volume were investigated new hydrological insights for region the trend of landuse change showed that the increased peak flow and flooding volume of junctions increased from 45 13 to 68 72 m3 s and 35 418 50 106 106 ltr respectively due to the imperviousness increasing from 10 to 70 similarly in response to climate change the simulated peak runoff increased by 46 9 34 8 and 37 5 for rca4 racmo22t and remo2009 respectively this findings showed that if the current landuse and climate changes continue in the coming years the study area threatened by the increased flooding due to the drainage systems will fail to accommodate increased peak runoff the present study suggests the adopted lids can be significantly reduced the effects of flooding problems in the town keywords climate change landuse change urban flooding lid pcswmm data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction urban flooding is one of the natural disaster that affects the environment human societies life and financial damage in different parts of the world stormwater drainage systems can be constructed to collect and convey the urban catchment stormwater to receiving water bodies while ensuring minimal damages fu and butler 2014 mcdonald and naughton 2019 the efficient of stormwater management systems however can be affected by an urban growth and changes in rainfall intensity due to climate conditions according to study by neupane et al 2021 and naje and zwain 2022 the drainage systems may have been designed without a detail analysis of both urbanization and climate change and this has been identified as one of the major causes of flooding in urban areas in the future the urban development in cities affects the runoff coefficients which can cause significant increases the peak stormwater and vulnerabilities to flooding risks due to the construction of residential commercial areas public buildings and roads the urbanization related change in runoff coefficient will have an impact on the stormwater drainage systems design parameters such as conduit flow flooding volume velocity profile and construction costs abd elhamid et al 2020 guan et al 2015 urban hydrological process have been extensively studied recent studies including those by huong and pathirana 2013 kong et al 2017 shanableh et al 2018 and haile and worku 2019 have noted that the runoff coefficient is affected globally because the paved surface areas increased as a result of urban development activities for the myponga catchment in south australia akhter and hewa 2016 simulated that the mean annual runoff would increase by 50 and 320 respectively as the imperviousness increased by 10 and 70 huong and pathirana 2013 predicted a similar increase in runoff of 21 as a result of a 55 increase in urban areas according to shanableh et al 2018 the study area s infrastructure and transportation are affected by flooding problems and the most of the existing drainage networks have been flooded the variation in the rainfall intensity with climate change is among the most important factors that affect the adequacy of drainage network assuming that the climate will remain stationary in the future various stormwater drainage facilities are typically designed using historical data climate change however is expected to have an impact on the future peak flow as well as the characteristics of extreme rainfall such as intensity duration and frequency moreover the drainage networks that were built without taking future precipitation patterns into account are not accommodate the increased flooding volume alamdari 2018 berggren et al 2014 thakali et al 2016 in a similar wang et al 2017 halsn√¶s and kaspersen 2018 and padulano et al 2021 studied the effects climate change on the performance of stormwater management systems and highlighted as the systems failed due to insufficient or overflowing capacity to carry the future projected peak stormwater rainfall prediction is essential for simulating future peak stormwater and managing future urban floods at the local scale several researchers conducted studies to improve the prediction of daily rainfall amounts using meteorology data from various countries furthermore researchers used data mining machine learning and soft computing techniques to improve the accuracy of daily rainfall and wave height prediction according to the findings the rainfall prediction process has shifted from data mining to soft computing approaches such as artificial neural network adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system regression analysis and random forest liyew and melese 2021 sadeghifar et al 2022 a few studies examined the combined effects of urbanization and climate change on urban runoff and reported that effective stormwater drainage systems considered both scenarios will needed to manage the risks of urban flooding in dublin city ireland willuweit et al 2016 used a dynamic urban water simulation model and found that the combined scenario increased the monthly runoff by 57 in addition philip mzava et al 2021 neupane 2018 and zhou et al 2021 investigated the impacts of both impacts landuse and climate change to evaluate the functionality of existing urban drainage networks and found that almost all systems failed to accommodate the flooding volume moreover to manage urban flooding it is critical to identify the uncertainty in flood magnitude due to simulation lama et al 2022 quantified flow velocity uncertainties by comparing the estimated flow velocity with the experimental measurements value the mitigation techniques are required to manage increased flooding while sustaining the functionality of existing urban drainage networks low impact development lid practices e g rainfall gardens green roofs bio retention infiltration trenches rain barrels vegetative swales and pervious pavement are flood management techniques that can be implemented at both the local and watershed scales fiori and volpi 2020 line et al 2012 luan et al 2017 furthermore lama et al 2020 evaluated the flow resistance in the channel using the partially vegetated and found that partially vegetated by rigid and emergent riparian plants can resist flow and flow velocity in the channel however the extent and frequency of urban flood risks that affect urban residents livelihoods are not the same under landuse and climate change effects according to investigated by different previous researchers poor urban drainage system planning and lack of hydrologic hydraulic efficiency consideration in developing countries including ethiopian similarly contribute to urban floods as a result the numerous towns cities of ethiopia affected by urban flooding problems many times for example the community of dire dawa adama addis ababa and robe have frequently complained about inadequate drainage systems during the rainy season these cities infrastructure and daily socioeconomic conditions are all regularly impacted birhanu et al 2016 haile and worku 2019 jemberie and melesse 2021 in the town of robe the stormwater drainage infrastructure frequently fails one of the most severe cases can be observed at robe town were the happening of flooding repeatedly many areas in the town have been inundated flooding has disrupted the community s daily activities as well as the homes of several residents to alleviate the these problem up to date analysis of landuse and climate change as well as adaption of effective low impact developments such as rain barrels rain gardens and a combination of both rain barrels and rain gardens should be required therefore this study is conducted to assess the potential effects of urbanization and climate change on peak stormwater magnitude and performance of current stormwater drainage systems using the personal computer storm water management model pcswmm 2 study area and data sources in this study the robe town was chosen as the study area 39056 00 e to 4006 40 e 705 20 n to 7010 40 n it situated in southeastern ethiopia in the oromia regional state the town covers a total of 6680 ha with an average elevation of 2565 m fig 1 the maximum and minimum annual precipitation from 1989 to 2020 in the town are 651 mm and 1309 mm respectively the stormwater of the study area drain into shaya river in the upper of genale dawa basin most of the rainfall falls in the wet season between july and november in order to assess the potential impacts of change in climate and urbanization this study required both spatial and temporal data sets the national meteorological agency of ethiopia provided daily rainfall datasets 1980 2020 for five meteorological stations in and near robe town that had a good record few missing data to evaluate the effects of future extreme rainfall on the drainage systems future projected rainfall data of fine spatial resolution 0 44 x0 44 global climate models were downloaded from cordex africa database via earth system grid federation esgf the landuse landcover masterplan data and sewer network data are obtained from robe town municipal city office a soil shapefile fao shape file was taken from the ministry of water and energy of ethiopia mowe the soil of the study area was extracted from shapefile format soil data and then projected using wgs 1984 utm zone 37 n the initial moisture deficit hydraulic conductivity and the suction head of the soil were estimated from literature based on the site soil types parnas et al 2021 a 12 5 m x 12 5 m spatial resolution dem was obtained from the alaska satellite facility asf database https asf alaska edu 3 methods it was the objective of this work assess the potential impacts of change in climate and urban development on the efficiency of stormwater drainage systems therefore to meet the aims of the study we i assessed the the hydrological process of the town based on the future projected rainfall from rcms ii quantified the effect of urbanization on the peak stormwater and adequacy of drainage systems iii simulated based on the combined impact of urbanization and climate change using the calibrated pcswmm model and iv evaluated the effectiveness of selected low impact development to minimize the amplified flooding risks from the town the simulated peak stormwater based landuse landcover in 2020 and the observed rainfall data was considered as the baseline to evaluate the percentage change in the future condition the used methods in this work is shown in fig 2 the details of each section are discussed below 3 1 climate change projections climate change influenced by the greenhouse gas emissions too has adverse effects on urban hydrology the variation in the rainfall intensity due to climate change is one of the adverse effect heavily affected to the urban stormwater management we considered five gcm such as ec earth mpi es lr canesm2 hadgem2 es and cnrm cm5 to assess the potential effects of climate change on flooding magnitude and drainage system performance chen et al 2012 mendlik and gobiet 2016 the outputs of regional climate models rcms racmo22t remo2009 rca4 racmo22t and rca4 were deriven from the global climate models under various greenhouse gas emission scenarios we projected the rcm outputs for two representative concentration pathways rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios in the near future 2020 2040 and the mid future 2041 2070 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 were chosen from among the four ipcc rcps because they represent medium and high emission scenarios respectively zickfeld et al 2013 numerous endeavors have been made to examine the performance of climate models in simulating various climate variables e g precipitation gu et al 2014 sun et al 2021a the climate models output data for the study area were evaluated using statistical evaluation such as percentage of bias root mean squared error and coefficient of variation rmse and coefficient of variation cv was used to assess rcm performance sun et al 2021b the projected precipitation data of remo2009 rca4 and racmo22t were used in this study because these climate models perform better results than other selected climate models in terms of bias cv and rmse 3 2 climate model bias correction after downloading precipitation data for each rcm netcdf network common data form files were extracted and bias corrected downscaling from rcms to urban catchment scales are needed because high resolution of temporal and spatial data is required to analyse the urban catchments willems et al 2012 then when compared to observed data the projected climate models output contain significant biases that restrict the use of the projected rainfall data of climate models as direct input for assessment of climate change impacts on the urban hydrological processes fang et al 2015 alamdari 2018 different software tools are available to downscale and bias correct climate data as suggested by existing tools cannot always perform the necessary processing due to time taking techniques cmhydr tool was used to extract and bias correct rcms rainfall data zhang et al 2018 bias correction was applied for downscaled future data using the observed data from 1989 to 2020 the missing daily observed rainfall was first filled using the normal ratio method and its consistency and outliers were then examined using the double mass curve and the grubbs and beck g b test respectively hamed and rao 2019 nadiatul adilah and hannani 2021 for the future periods 2020 2040 and 2041 2070 the bias corrected rainfall data of the climate predictors from the rracmo22t remo and rca4 simulations were used to develop the idf relations and estimate the design storms for the study area 3 3 derivation of intensity duration frequency idf hydrological study in a small urban catchment requires rainfall data at smaller spatial and temporal scales depending on the purpose for urban flooding management studies it is necessary to have rainfall data on hourly sub hourly time scales as suggested by ewea et al 2018 and krvavica and rubiniƒá 2020 there are several rain gauges that have been in use for many years in most regions although the most of them record daily rainfall whereas hourly or sub hourly data recorders are less common in developing nations like ethiopia due to absence of short duration rainfall studies dealing with climate change impacts on stormwater management systems are particularly challenging willems et al 2012 thus to address this limitation several researchers were developed different empirical reduction equations to disaggregate daily rainfall data to short duration for different regions around the world such as hershfeld equation 1961 for the usa bell equation 1969 indian meteorological department and modified indian meteorological department palaka et al 2016 al mamun et al 2018 nwaogazie et al 2021 although some of these equations have demonstrated adequate accuracy the disadvantage is that either the calculation of short duration rainfall or the evaluation of the parameters involved is complex allard and bourotte 2015 in this study the indian meteorological department formula was used because compared to other it is widely used and simple to estimate the rainfall depths of hourly scale which is 1 p t p 24 x t 24 1 3 where pt mm is the rainfall depth for the duration of t hour p24 maximum annual daily rainfall mm and t the time duration in hours for the required rainfall depth in hours for the rainfall data generalized pareto s distribution provided a better fit than the other distribution based on kolmogorov smirnov anderson darling and chi square test of goodness of fit gado et al 2021 mamoon and rahman 2017 the rainfall intensity is estimated using best fitted distribution i e generalized pareto s eq 1 for the baseline and future period are used for development of idf curves which is shown in fig 3 2 p t Œæ Œ± k Œª t k where pt is t year rainfall depth mm Œæ Œ± and k was the estimated parameters the rainfall intensity mm hr for each return period with respect to corresponding rainfall duration is estimated using pt td where td is rainfall duration the design storm is derived for different return periods from idf curves the design storm design is then used as input to pcswmm for the following time periods ii baseline period 1990 2020 with landuse landcover from 2020 ii projected climate change 2020 2050 with the projected landuse from 2035 and iii projected climate change 2020 2050 with the projected landuse from 2020 in this study the simulated value for the baseline and each projected scenario are compared as mentioned previously nguyen et al 2010 and berggren et al 2014 have assessed the accuracy of different design storm models used the chicago design storm is the most accurate in the estimation of peak stormwater for urban catchment fig 3 shows the design storm for 1990 2020 and 2020 2040 period based rcms projected changing climatic conditions 3 4 landuse change analysis urbanization is expected to substantially alter the surface hydrological characteristics may include decreases infiltration and increased surface runoff associated with impervious surface areas kong et al 2017 therefore to evaluate the impact of landuse change on the urban flooding and efficient of drainage systems the current 2020 and future developed landuse 2035 are utilized in this study the future landuse of the town that was prepared by the oromia urban planning institute and obtained from robe town municipality city the cad format lulc data were first converted to a gis shapefile dataset and the projected coordinate system was set to a wgs 1984 utm zone 37 n according to the projected land use plan for the robe town 2015 2035 the current landuse landcover will be changed to developed urban area by 2035 from 2020 2035 there was a 25 38 increase in imperviousness in the study area among them the residential area will account for the largest portion of the total area 3767 5 56 4 followed by the governmental building 1022 15 3 and roads 1416 2 21 2 in order to assess the separate effects of landuse change on the peak stormwater and efficiency of drainage systems the percentage of impervious was determined from the landuse data for 2020 and 2035 and separately input with the design storm estimated from observed rainfall data however to simulate the combined effects of landuse and climate change the imperviousness estimated from the future landuse 2035 was used with the design storm of three rcms 3 5 application of pcswmm the personnel computer storm water management model pcswmm is a dyanamic model for simulating rainfall runoff for a single event or long term period in urban areas as suggested ahiablame and shakya 2016 akhter and hewa 2016 pcswmm was chosen for this study based on the following criteria i it generates peak stormwater based on the rain gauge and inputted physical parameters of sub catchment i e area of sub catchment overland flow width overland slope the ratio of imperviousness roughness of coefficient of pervious cover etc ii it is a dynamic rainfall runoff model and can simulate both the event and continuous events iii it can simulate hydrological hydraulic responses to impacts of landuse and climate change iv it is suitable in an urban catchment area less than 100 km2 and v it has built in sensitivity based radio tuning calibration srtc tool the whole study area is divided into 53 sub catchments in pcswmm and each sub catchment requires its own set of estimated parameters akhter and hewa 2016 to divide the sub catchment 118 junctions were identified first based on the topography and road layout the sub catchments were then delineated with the arc hydro extension in arc map 10 3 fig 4 with this division the basic parameters of each sub catchment such as area width average slope percentage of impervious area and others could be derived from dem landuse and soil shapefile the properties of nodes x y coordinates and invert elevation maximum junction depth and links conduits length and depth conduit inlet and outlet were collected via field measurements these properties were converted into shapefile using arc gis 10 3 and then imported into pcswmm with sub catchment physical parameters and design storms of the rain gauge lee et al 2017 dynamic flow routing was selected from three types of flow routing in this study because it accounts for channel storage flow reversal and entrance exit losses in this study the green ampt infiltration model was used because it is based on physical parameters that are related to the town s soil characteristics 3 6 model calibration and validation the model was required since a various of parameters was estimated from various data sources and these parameters affect the model output with different weights resulting in different uncertainty gao et al 2020 to solve this the sensitiveity analysis was investigated to identify which inputted parameters using local sensitivity analysis technique mancipe munoz et al 2014 the local method was selected because it is easy compared to global technique to select the sensitive parameters one parameter was changed at a time while the other parameters remain unchanged padulano et al 2016 pcswmm s sensitivity based radio tuning calibration srtc tool allow the user to select the initial values of sensitive parameters assign the uncertainty values by comparing the observed and simulated channel runoff depth to evaluate the performance of model niyonkuru et al 2018 perin et al 2020 as shown in fig 5 srtc has ability to select sensitive parameters and adjust the value of inputted parameters to minimize the difference between the model output and measured runoff depth in urban areas particularly in ethiopian cities and towns it is difficult to get gauged flow data which makes it challenge to perform a robust calibration and validation of the model similar challenges happened in other areas when several studies attempted to calibrate the simulation model however a many of earlier researchers tested the stormwater models manually and automatically using the short term observed data we therefore adopted suggestions provided by yim et al 2016 basnayaka 2012 and perin et al 2020 in this work the runoff depth event was collected from field observation on rainy days for this rainfall events and their corresponding runoff depth in the conduit were recorded from 10th june to 15th september 2021 at every five minutes intervals near to madda walabu university x 610474 y 788610 and siko mando hotel x 611589 y 786817 this two stations were selected because the most of runoff from conduits was collected therein and near to the systems outfalls the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse the root mean square error to the standard deviation ratio rsr and the coefficient of determination r2 was selected to evaluate the model performance niazi et al 2017 4 results and discussion 4 1 sensitivity analysis calibration and validation the sensitivity analysis is performed to select and adjust the model sensitive parameters after the user defined uncertainty values or rankings were assigned for each parameter table 1 by comparing the agreement between the simulated and observed runoff depth the sensitive parameters were systematically adjusted using srtc to obtain fitted parameter values within the limited range calibration started by changing the impervious ratio while keeping the initial values of all other parameters in this case the simulated value is greater than the observed value so the value of imperviousness was reduced by 25 from its initial value to reduce the simulated value the width of the sub catchment is the second sensitive parameter that is adjusted using the calibrated imperviousness values similarly calibration was performed for each parameter one by one by comparing the simulated and observed runoff values on the graphical plot with the efficiency criteria values the final efficiency criteria results after the calibration in the selected conduits were r2 0 5 nse 0 5 and psr 0 7 niazi et al 2017 neupane et al 2021 this result shows that the difference between the simulated and observed runoff depth values was closely matched and the values of r2 nse and psr were within acceptable ranges when the values of the sensitive parameters presented in table 1 were changed from their initial values the imperviousness width and slope were found to be the most sensitive parameters that affected the model outputs while the average slope was found to be the least sensitive parameter suction head and saturated hydraulic conductivity were noticed to be less sensitive parameters estimated from the study area s soil shapefile this results is consistent with the previous study findings of ahiablame and shakya 2016 and akhter and hewa 2016 once the model is calibrated it needs to be validated the chosen event for validation is taken from the conduit of c86 figs 6 and 7 shows the graphical comparison of observed and simulated runoff depth for both calibrated and validated it can be noted that the pcswmm model has an acceptable accuracy for the study area as evident from the goodness of fit indices values the model fits well for rainfall runoff simulation in the robe town 4 2 impacts of landuse change on the efficiency of stormwater drainage systems the results of future landuse analysis show that the robe town experienced significant developed compared to the current landuse the greatest change will be the conversion of open area to impervious surface as a result of rapid urbanization as shown in table 2 increasing impervious surface area from 68 5 to 83 65 within 20 years 2020 2035 results in peak flow increasing from 45 1 m3 s to 68 72 m3 s this indicated that the construction of residential commercial public buildings and roads in 2035 will affect the runoff coefficient resulting significant increases in stormwater and flooding volume this increase is linear with the flooding volume and the number of flooded junctions which indicates vurnerable to flooding risks as presented in table 2 the simulation results showed that the total flooding increased from 35 418 to 50 106 106 ltr when compared to the baseline this is consistent with the findings of the abd elhamid et al 2020 and marhaento et al 2018 studies which found that rapid urbanization increased flooding volume and the number of flooded junctions while decreasing infiltration rates knowing flood locations and flooding types is very important to provide a technical solution for experts and decision makers in order to identify problems in the system and evaluate proposed solution the pcswmm can identify the location and type of flooding in the town based the flooding flow rate at junctions the simulation results show that 32 junctions 27 1 of a total of 119 are flooded however if the study area s impervious surface area increases further in the future 56 junctions 47 5 of a total of 119 are expected to be flooded as suggested by hassan et al 2017 based on the flooding flow rate on junctions 18 5 28 6 34 and 18 9 of junctions are were slightly flooded fairly flooded highly flooded and very highly flooded respectively the increase in urban flooding could be a result of the increase in imperviousness is expected in 2035 and to a decrease in infiltration rate under future scenarios of land use many areas of town were inundated as a result particularly near robe square and the heavy flood hampered people s movement and disrupted the transportation system for hours as evidence fig 8 depicts a flooded area near the town s roundabout moreover flooding problems will may affects the resident s house damages property and infrastructure this caused problems in a several residents homes as well as disruptions in people s daily lives and the town s economy hu et al 2020 reported an increase in impervious surfaces in beijing s central area leading to an increase in flooding risks in the area which is consistent with the findings of this study high flooding risks are expected in the urban cenetr as a result of future urban growth 4 3 impacts of climate change on the efficiency of stormwater drainage systems in order to quantify the impacts of the projected climate change scenarios on the peak storms and flooding in the robe town the future design storms were derived from the idf curves of three rcms the idf curves for the future show a significant increase in design storm peak runoff increased by 46 9 34 8 and 37 5 respectively in rca4 racmo22t and remo2009 when compared to the baseline scenario during near future scenarios fig 9 in contrast the mid future climate change scenario resulted in peak runoff of 120 39 146 36 and 151 6 m3 s respectively due to the projected rainfall intensity by remo2009 rca4 and racmo22t which is greater than the near future scenario in the study area the significant change in rainfall intensity under climate change conditions predicted by climate model predictors increased the severity and risks of urban flooding in the study area this happened as a result of existing drainage systems designed based on historical idf relationships taking stationary in the future period furthermore the simulated peak runoff due to the rca4 climate model is expected to be higher because the design storms estimated from rca4 idf curves are higher than the other two climate models according to the findings it is reasonable to conclude that the significant changes in peak stormwater and flooding volume with respect to the current period are dependent on the type climate models rainfall duration return period and periods as presented in the previous study shahabul alam and elshorbagy 2015 degaetano and castellano 2017 the impacts of change on the magnitude of flooding and the adequacy of existing drainage systems are not the same under all selected climate models when compared to the baseline the total flooded junctions increased by 43 5 48 1 and 62 7 respectively under the climate models remo2009 racmo22t and rca4 a 64 4 are flooded junctions according to a simulation of the drainage system considering ensemble climate furthermore the simulation results show that as climate changes the flooding volume of junctions increased from 44 028 to 70 560 106 ltr these findings indicated that an increase in flooding volume and flooded junctions when future rainfall is altered due to climate change babaei et al 2018 in support of that hossain et al 2020 reported that the volume of flooding and the number of flooded junctions increased by 47 and 48 respectively as a result of climate change in like manner hassan et al 2017 reported a 47 increase in flooding as a result of climate change overall the findings revealed that the drainage system will be unable to collect and safely convey peak stormwater from the town as a result of climate change 4 4 combined impact of landuse and climate change on urban flooding to assess the combined impact of landuse and climate change the calibrated pcswmm is run with the future landuse and projected climate scenarios for period 2020 2040 during 2020 2040 the simulated peak stormwater is 162 9 144 5 and 186 8 m3 s under combined landuse and climate change conditions using the racmo22t remo and rca4 climate models respectively furthermore when the future landuse was simulated with racmo22t remo and rca4 the flooding volume increased by 63 5 74 1 and 83 9 for the periods 2041 2070 respectively as the percentage of the urban area increases with climate change the high flood magnitude will be expected the urban center from welmel sub city to roundabout is completely flooded when the future imperviousness is combined with the predicted rainfall of racmo22t remo and rca4 the flooding volume of junctions is will rose to 65 849 106 61 630 106 and 72 954 106 ltr respectively the results of this study shown the flooding magnitude will very high and might even enter properties causing damage to property and infrastructure furthermore the expected flooding will disrupt community activities causing property and infrastructure damage this was consistent with the findings of saraswat et al 2016 naje and zwain 2022 and wang et al 2017 examined the effects of both climate variability and land use change in the china catchment and discovered that the combined scenario influenced the hydrological response more strongly than the separate scenarios to minimize the flooding risks in urban areas the efficient stormwater management systems should be redesigned considering the potential effects of both climate change and urbanization as noted that by thakali et al 2016 and binesh et al 2019 4 5 mitigation option to reduce urban flooding flooding in the study area is caused by separate climate and landuse scenario as well as combined scenario the mitigation option is required to manage the increased flooding from the town and continued functionality of existing urban drainage networks thus three types of lids rain barrels rain gardens and a combination of both rain barrels and rain gardens were applied to reduce significantly flooding in a most flooded area when simulated with racmo22t remo and rca4 a rain garden reduced stormwater by up to 26 5 31 2 and 32 8 respectively however in comparison to without lids a rain barrel reduced 8 2 33 1 12 7 43 6 and 8 2 33 1 of the total flooding volume however the combination of both lids practices can further reduce peak runoff zhu and chen 2017 luan et al 2019 flooding can be reduced by implemented lids by 19 2 32 6 and 13 9 25 4 under landuse scenarios of 2020 and 2035 respectively in the future as the percentage of impervious surface area increases due to climate change the implementation of lids with an adequate drainage network will be required likewise most earlier studies have revealed that the percentage of significant reduction of various low impact development approaches is not the same huang et al 2014 hua et al 2020 bai et al 2018 4 6 uncertainty in peak flow in order to manage urban flooding it is critical to identify the uncertainty in flood magnitude due to urban climate and urbanisation impact fig 9 shows the variation uncertainty in peak flow under various scenarios changes in peak runoff from the baseline scenario were calculated and compared to further quantify the independent impacts of landuse and climate on simulation results as shown in table 3 when considering landuse and climate change the percentage change in peak stormwater was estimated to be 47 84 and 53 47 respectively for the future scenario it can be observed that when compared to urbanization the effect of climate change on peak runoff is more profound similarly poelmans et al 2011 and akter et al 2018 in belgium found that climate change was more likely to cause a larger change in peak flows than the urban growth scenarios 5 conclusions pcswmm is a dynamic rainfall runoff model which is widely used to assess the potential effects of landuse and climate change on the efficiency of urban stormwater drainage systems in this study projected rainfall data from three rcms remo2009 rca4 and racmo22t and landuse data 2020 and 2035 were incorporated into the model the srtc tool was used to perform the sensitivity analysis calibration and validation of the pcswmm the local sensistivity analysis technique was performed to identify the sensitive parameters and the results show that the ratio of imperviousness area manning s roughness coefficient and depth of depression storage are very sensitive parameters that have a significant impact on peak runoff and flooding volume the results of goodness of fit indices values revealed the pcswmm model had a good accuracy for simulation of rainfall runoff process under landuse and climate change in the robe town the land use change with loss of pervious surface area can increase peak stormwater flooding volume and number of flooded junctions according to simulation results 52 94 of existing drainage systems will be flooded as a result of urban growth stormwater will be expected to be higher in future period due to reduced infiltration caused by surface armoring in urban areas in addition to landuse climate change has increased the volume of flooding in the study area causing infrastructure damage and interfering with community activities a comparison of observed and projected idf curves under changing climate scenarios shows that flooding volume increases by 52 48 6 and 62 7 for racmo22t remo and rca4 respectively it is clear that increase in design storm in the near future and mid future has a significant impact on stormwater and simulation time combined change in land use and climate increased the peak stormwater up to 52 1 and magnitude of flooding up to 67 4 more compared the baseline condition this indicates that the study area will be the worst with flooding condition due to combined scenario increased impervious surfaces and climate change an inadequate drainage systems cannot accommodate to convey the peak flooding before design period as result of variation in rainfall intensity and imperviousness increased during the rainy season the town is frequently wracked by flooding problems in particular flooding has severely impacted the center of the city knowing the types of flooding from the junctions and locations of flooding is critical for accurately identifying flood problems stormwater management systems built in robe town should be redesigned to handle future flood events as a result this study is expected to provide decision makers with management practises to identify urban flooding problems funding the authors
