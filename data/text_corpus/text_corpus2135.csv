10675,green water is a central resource for global agricultural production understanding its role is fundamental to design strategies to increase global food and feed production while avoiding further land conversion and obtaining more crop per drop brazil is a country with high water availability and a major exporter of agricultural goods and virtual water we assess here water use and water productivity in brazil for four major rainfed crops cotton maize soybeans and wheat for this we use the epic crop model to perform a spatially explicit assessment of consumptive water use and water productivity under crop management scenarios in brazil between 1990 and 2013 we investigate four different land water interactions i water use and productivity for different management scenarios ii the potential of supplemental irrigation for productivity improvement iii changes in green water use throughout the study period and finally iv potential reduction of land and water demand related to agricultural intensification the results show that for the studied crops green water is the main resource for biomass production and intensification can lead to great improvements in green water productivity the results also suggest that despite achieving higher yields irrigation based intensification tends to lower overall water productivity compared to fertilizer based intensification strategies this is however regionally and crop specific furthermore due to higher yields and water productivity producing the same amount of crop output in irrigated or rainfed intensification scenarios would result in the reduction of resource demand in the order of 34 58 for cropland and 29 52 for water keywords green water sustainability epic crop modeling water footprint 1 introduction

al 2017 on the other side the use of green water i e soil water formed by precipitation and available to plants is about four to five times higher than blue water use in agriculture globally hoff et al 2010 while water science has mostly focused on estimating and managing blue water understanding how to make better use of green water resources is fundamental to meet future demands falkenmark and rockstrom 2006 water productivity is usually defined as the amount of crop yield obtained relative to the evapotranspiration of green and blue water during production improvement of water productivity is an important strategy to reduce the need for additional resources in both irrigated and rainfed systems molden et al 2010 on a global perspective commodity trade from areas with high water productivity to areas with lower productivity results in net water savings chapagain 2006 fader 2011 improving the management of green water and increasing green water productivity is desirable both in arid and water abundant areas rockström and barron 2007 higher crop yields can reduce the impact of agricultural systems by facilitating sparing of lands with high biodiversity phalan et al 2011 at the same time higher water productivities generate net water savings and reduce pressure in regions with higher water stress or scarcity fader et al 2011 existing water footprint studies have largely focused on impacts of water use on the location of production particularly in water stressed areas brazil has abundant blue and green water resources although the local availability of water is highly heterogeneous ana 2013 flach et al 2016 as a major agricultural producer and net exporter of agricultural commodities brazil exports about 54 8 billion m3 of virtual water per year mainly to europe da silva et al 2016 brazilian agriculture has undergone stark changes in the last decades through horizontal expansion and intensification dias et al 2016 zalles et al 2019 the expansion of brazilian cropland has been connected to increasing conversion of natural ecosystems and negative impacts to biodiversity and the water cycle bondeau et al 2007 gibbs et al 2010 spera et al 2016 zalles et al 2019 previous virtual water trade analysis of brazilian agriculture on a national scale used rather coarse datasets from available global water footprint assessments such as the one presented in the work of mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 da silva et al 2016 flach et al 2016 other water footprint and virtual water trade studies focused on smaller scales and regional scales mostly relying on local measurements albuquerque 2013 carvalho and menezes 2014 lathuillière et al 2018 2014 silva et al 2015 our present study is the first to model local agricultural water footprints for brazilian agriculture at a national scale employing a spatially explicit biophysical crop growth model at high spatial resolution with most recent input data we analyze land and water interactions for agricultural production in the recent past and for scenarios of agricultural management here we focus only on green and blue water we aim to understand the recent changes in green water use in brazilian agriculture but also possibilities for the future in particular the role that blue water can play in improving land and water productivity by providing spatially explicit and process based assessments of green and blue water in agriculture advanced crop models have enabled the progress of global water footprints and trade studies these biophysical models applied in global water assessments include gepic liu 2009 liu and yang 2010 gcwm siebert and döll 2008 h08 hanasaki et al 2013 konar et al 2016 lpjml fader et al 2010 gerten et al 2011 rost et al 2008 and wbmplus wisser et al 2008 with the use of the epic biophysical crop model and high resolution soil elevation and climate data we simulated 24 crop cycles between 1990 and 2013 for four traditionally rainfed crops cotton first and second season maize soybeans and wheat first we analyze how changes in nutrient input affect yields and water productivity and investigate how the intensification of food production in brazil affects agricultural water use productivity furthermore we estimate the geographical distribution of irrigation potential across the country lastly we analyzed the influence of agricultural intensification scenarios on the demand for water and land 2 materials and methods 2 1 the epic model the environmental policy integrated climate epic model simulates the biological physical and chemical processes that occur in the soil plant atmosphere management system at the field scale with a daily time step williams et al 2008 the model contains several modules which simulate processes related to weather hydrology erosion nutrients soil temperature plant growth plant environment control and tillage although originally designed to model soil erosion impacts on crop production epic has been used comprehensively to simulate climate change impacts nutrient cycling and loss soil carbon pesticide fate among others gassman et al 2004 epic has been used to model processes on regional and global scales via coupling with spatial data organized either within regular geographical grid e g gepic documented in liu 2009 or with the use of homogeneous response unit approaches e g in epic iiasa documented in balkovič et al 2014 previous studies have assessed impacts of crop management on yields and externalities across a range of management systems ranging from smallholder agriculture folberth et al 2012 to high input systems balkovič et al 2014 and has frequently been used to study crop water relations chun and li 2010 liu 2009 liu et al 2007 liu and yang 2010 the model has been validated across scales from the field to continental balkovič et al 2018 folberth et al 2012 and global studies müller et al 2017 epic has also been previously shown to be suitable to model brazilian agriculture barros et al 2005 2004 gaiser et al 2010 here the 0810 version of the model source code in fortran was compiled and modified for parallel processing in a linux environment to make it capable of iterative simulations over a large number of parameter settings 2 2 general modeling framework the epic model contains a large number of crop and model parameters it requires detailed input data on weather topography soil crop and crop management the calibration and validation of the model over large areas is a challenge since i there are usually no comprehensive experimental or independent data available that allow testing of the entire set of variables represented in the model for full range of conditions and ii aggregated data from regional statistics are usually insufficient as they do not represent field scale conditions balkovič et al 2013 we used an approach based on the methodology used in balkovič et al 2013 in which i the default biophysical process parameter values in epic were adopted with minor adjustments ii reviewed crop parameters based on average cultivar characteristics for the selected crops were used for the entire study area and iii sensitivity analysis and adjustment for main management parameters namely sowing dates length of growing season and potential heat units were performed to handle main sources of uncertainty this methodology ensured that the plasticity of the results we obtained were driven by crop management and not by improper setting of basic condition for crop growth this was achieved by reflecting the consistency between potential heat unit phu and planting harvesting dates and placing vegetation season to suitable parts of year with sufficient temperature sum for the crop as a result low yields are a result of low inputs or overall poor agro environmental climate and soil conditions not because of not reaching expected phus while data on fertilizer use has become more abundant and spatially explicit in recent years it is still limited in terms of temporal evolution for this reason we chose a scenario approach in our methodology which is described in section 2 5 when it comes to cultivar development and characteristics the availability of standardized documented data becomes even more limited especially considering the changes that have taken place during the study period adding a spatial and temporal cultivar component could have a great amount of uncertainty and our chosen approach was to apply homogeneous cultivar parameters based on values found in the literature while considering the use of regional cultivar maturity classes reflected in reported growing periods finally to reduce aggregation errors related to the biophysical input data we applied a homogeneous response unit approach described in further detail in section 2 3 the crop and model parameters used in the model runs as well as the homogeneous response units and the aggregated input data are

consumptive water use and production cotton maize soybeans and wheat these four crops are among the ten most important crops in terms of harvested area and total production in brazil they covered approximately 70 of the total harvested area in brazil in 2017 ibge 2018 we present further background information on agro hydro climatic conditions in brazil in figures a1 to a5 in the supplementary material irrigated agriculture in brazil is mostly connected to production of rice and sugarcane which together are responsible for 51 of total irrigated area the share of irrigated area relative to the total harvested area for soybean wheat maize and cotton are of 3 7 4 2 4 3 and 6 5 respectively fao 2017 here we first assumed the selected crops as produced solely in rainfed systems and on a later stage estimated how much blue water would be necessary to meet the crops water requirements with supplemental irrigation we modeled maize twice to represent two production systems the main maize crop and second maize crop called safrinha in brazil brazilian farmers commonly plant safrinha maize as a second crop after soybeans and therefore second season maize has a different calendar from main season maize our model setup does not simulate double cropping and instead simulates second season maize separately as a fifth crop the yield of maize soybeans and wheat correspond to the seed yield while the cotton yield corresponds to the sum of the lint and seed yields we simulated soil and water processes associated with crop growth in brazil between 1990 and 2013 the simulated area comprises only areas classified as cropland during the study period see fig 1 for this study the epic model was setup and run for more than 8 104 simulation units these units were classified primarily in terms of their biophysical homogeneity and then further delimited based on municipality administrative boundaries the procedure for delimitation of the simulation units was adapted from the methodology developed for the geobene global database for biophysical modeling skalsky et al 2008 first a homogeneous response unit hru is an area with similar soil topography and climate characteristics for delimitation of the hrus we classified the soil and topography databases based on predetermined thresholds see detailed description and thresholds in supplementary material the final boundaries of the simulation units resulted from the overlap of the climate dataset grid the municipality boundaries and the boundaries of the previously delimited hrus the resolution of the datasets used to delimitate the simulation units ranged from the 300 m resolution land use maps esa 2017 1 km resolution soil and topography datasets hengl et al 2014 jarvis et al 2008 and the 0 25 degrees climate grid xavier et al 2016 the municipal boundary shapefile divides the brazilian territory in approximately 6000 municipalities 2 4 simulation setup to reduce uncertainties related to the crop calendars an initial model run is performed to select optimal calendars based on planting and harvesting dates available in the dataset published in sacks et al 2010 this dataset includes time windows for the planting and harvesting season for different areas around the country we ran the model for non irrigated conditions with minimized nutrient stress for three different calendar options early mid and late planting and harvesting the option with higher yields for each crop and simulation unit was chosen we calculated the phu for each crop simulation unit and planting and harvesting window we initialized the model by carrying out spin up model runs for the period 1980 1990 to equilibrate the nutrient pools in soil comprising soil organic carbon and total and organic nitrogen and phosphorous the spin up runs generated soil profile values that were used as inputs to the final transient model runs the supplementary material provides further detail on the methodology for phu calculation model initialization and spin up model runs tables a 2 a 4 2 5 crop management scenarios with the lack of spatially and temporally explicit data on fertilizer use producing a business as usual reconstruction of yields in the scale of this study would not be possible therefore we designed water and fertilization scenarios in order to explore different outcomes within a space of possibilities for agricultural management we assumed here that the yield changes in the scenarios developed are dependent on water and nutrient availability and thus we designed the scenarios based on fertilizer and irrigation application we chose to consider irrigation and fertilizer application as these explain 60 80 of global yield variability for most major crops mueller et al 2012 we do not consider however other management options like tillage mulching pest control and cultivar development we simulated six different crop management scenarios depicting different combinations of fertilizer application and irrigation see table 1 the first scenario which we named no fertilization assumes crop management with no additional water or fertilizer input and aims to simulate how the production of the selected crops would be without any external input on the other side of the spectrum two scenarios called high input are designed to provide enough fertilizer input to minimize nutrient stress other two fertilizer scenarios were designed based on historical fertilizer application data called low input and mid input and are intended to mimic the input level of farms with intermediate cropping intensity the mid and high input scenarios were simulated both for irrigated and non irrigated conditions while the no fertilization and low input scenarios were simulated only for rainfed conditions the application rate values for nitrogen and phosphorus for the low and mid input scenarios were classified by identifying representative application rate values for brazil from mueller et al 2012 in the irrigation scenarios the model supplies irrigation water on each day in which the water stress factor exceeds 20 water stress trigger of 0 8 thus allowing a small degree of water stress for nitrogen application the model was set to provide nitrogen when nitrogen stress is above 20 nitrogen stress trigger of 0 8 with a pre determined application rate specific to each scenario when it comes to phosphorus the model was set to apply a certain application rate before planting the fertilizer levels and stress triggers used to set up each scenario are detailed in supplementary material tables a 3 and a 4 2 6 water use and efficiency indicators the model output of epic comprises detailed information on crop growth water nutrient and carbon fluxes in daily monthly and yearly steps for this study we focus on the estimated annual yield yd ton ha the growing season evapotranspiration gset mm and the amount of water provided by irrigation annually ir mm we chose to use the hargreaves method in the epic model for estimating evapotranspiration hargreaves and samani 1985 the blue water corresponds to the ir parameter and the green water corresponds to the total growing season evapotranspiration gset minus the water application through irrigation g r e e n w a t e r m m g s e t m m i r m m the consumptive water use cwu m3 yr crop water productivity wp kg m3 and virtual water content vwc m3 kg in a certain area are defined and calculated as follows in the main body of this article we analyze only consumptive water use and water productivity values in the supplementary material we also present the values of virtual water content for comparison with values previously reported in the literature c w u m 3 y r 10 g s e t m m y r a r e a s i m u h a w p k g m 3 100 y d t o n h a g s e t m m v w c m 3 t o n 10 g s e t m m y d t o n h a we aggregated the yields and water productivities from the simulation unit to the municipal level by calculating the weighted averages using the simulation unit area divided by the total simulation unit area in each municipality as weights we then aggregated them to the regional level using the harvested area per municipality divided by the total harvested area per region as weights to estimate the consumptive water use and water productivity for the historical scenario we used the simulated growing season evapotranspiration from the high input rainfed scenario aggregated at the municipal level and the reported yields between 1990 and 2013 ibge 2018 therefore we assume that the water use for production in this period comprises only rainfed agriculture and accounts only for green water use we calculated the potential for implementation of irrigation infrastructure ip using two different approaches first the potential for irrigation is described as the rate of yield increase between the irrigated and rainfed high input scenario ip1 as an indicator of the potential of supplemental irrigation to increase local crop productivity i p 1 100 y d h i i r r t o n h a y d h i r f t o n h a y d h i r f t o n h a in a second approach we assume that the more of blue water is necessary to meet the crop water requirements the higher the likelihood that farmers will make the choice to implement irrigation systems ip2 it is common to assume that irrigation systems will be implemented if the rate between blue and total water use is above a certain threshold usually around 10 dell angelo et al 2018 rosa et al 2018 accordingly we further estimate the potential for implementation of irrigation ip2 as the rate between blue and total consumptive water use during the cropping season i p 2 100 i r h i i r r m m g s e t h i i r r m m with the use of the estimated land and water productivity we calculated how much water and land would be necessary for each municipality to produce the same amount of crop output reported during the study period p r e p o r t e d k g y e a r for each scenario the reported production between 1990 and 2013 was obtained from ibge 2017 we calculated first the necessary area and consumptive water use for each municipality and then aggregated it to the national level the area was calculated with the use of the yields estimated by the model for each scenario while the consumptive water use relies on the water productivity levels estimated by the model for each scenario c w u s c e n a r i o m 3 y r p r e p o r t e d k g y r w p s c e n a r i o k g m 3 h a s c e n a r i o h a y r p r e p o r t e d k g y r y d s c e n a r i o k g h a by computing the difference between the water and land demand in each scenario and the actual water and land requirements we estimated the water and land demand reduction potential of each scenario d e m a n d r e d u

properties boer 2015 with a resolution of 1 km the topography maps for the area were obtained from the nasa shuttle radar topographic mission srtm 90 m digital elevation database v4 1 available through the consortium for spatial information cgiar csi of the consultative group for international agricultural research cgiar jarvis et al 2008 the cgiar csi srtm digital elevation models have a resolution of 90 m at the equator daily climate data on maximum and minimum temperature precipitation wind speed relative humidity and solar radiation between 1980 and 2013 for brazil were obtained from the database of daily gridded meteorological variables for brazil xavier et al 2016 with a spatial resolution of 15 arcminutes the mapping of cropland and harvested areas were obtained from two data sources the area delimited for cropland in general was based on the european space agency s climate change initiative land cover maps esa cci lc maps at the resolution of 1 km esa 2017 the harvested area and crop production per brazilian municipality were obtained from the brazilian statistics bureau ibge 2018 for around 5500 municipalities and all crops of interest between 1990 and 2015 the crop calendars were based on the publicly available data set of global planting date patterns developed by sacks et al 2010 we overlaid the datasets with classes of soil texture cropland area slope and altitude at the 1 km resolution to delimitate the simulation units which became the spatial units on which the model is run the crop calendars and weather data were used to calculate the phus necessary for the model setup the datasets of soil altitude crop calendar and weather were averaged by simulation unit area in order to produce the input files for the model 3 results 3 1 yields and water productivity the following section describes our results for consumptive water use and water productivities a detailed comparison of these results with previous studies and with reported data is provided in the supplementary material tables a 6 a 11 as expected higher nutrient and water application rates resulted in consistently higher simulated crop yields and higher water productivity values table 2 the average water productivity of irrigation scenarios is slightly lower than the water productivity of equivalent i e high input rainfed scenarios thus increased water input is likely to increase the amount of water per unit of output to assess the space for improvements in crop yields and water productivity we computed the yield difference between simulations of high input systems and reported municipal averages for entire brazil in the period 1990 2013 for the estimation of water productivity we used an average of the modelled growing season evapotranspiration for rainfed scenarios table 3 shows the spatial and temporal average of the growing season evapotranspiration for all crops for irrigated and rainfed scenarios the evapotranspiration of rainfed scenarios includes only green water while irrigated scenario footprints include both green and blue water fig 2 shows the simulated impacts of water and nutrient management on crop yields and water productivity supplementary irrigation leads to much smaller yield increases than supplementary fertilization for maize and wheat the average yield improvements of supplemental irrigation are mostly negligible however when analyzing the same data regionally we observe higher changes in the south and southeast regions for soybeans and in the northeast region for cotton see figs b 4 b 5 on the other hand we find that second season maize greatly increases yields across the territory which indicates that water availability could be one of the main limitations for double cropping expansion see figs 2 and b 3 while the average water productivities are smaller for irrigated scenarios compared to the corresponding rainfed scenario with the same level of fertilization in some cases irrigated yields are much higher e g cotton fig b 1 the highest yield increases for cotton occur in the northeast region this region also shows the steepest decreases in water productivities for both main and second season maize see figs b 2 b 3 for most crops the range of scenario results adequately covers the observed variability of the reported yields during the study period this agreement is especially noticeable for crops with moderate spatial variability such as wheat and cotton or presents reported and simulated homogeneous yield values such as soybeans on the other hand the high spatial variability of reported maize yields is not fully reproduced in our simulations fig 2 maize production is dispersed across a much larger number of municipalities and includes both smallholder and commercial farming 3 2 feasibility of supplemental irrigation the scenario results indicate that fertilization is generally more important for improving crop yields than irrigation however the benefits of supplemental irrigation and its influence on annual water use differ greatly between crops and locations in this section we analyze which crops and areas of the country could benefit more from additional blue water as well as where blue water would make up a larger share of total water demand fig 3 shows spatial differences between high input non irrigated and high input irrigated scenarios the ratio between blue and total water use depicts the share of irrigation water necessary for optimal plant growth fig 3a the potential yield changes fig 3b indicate regions that would benefit the most from supplemental irrigation to illustrate the potential pressure of irrigation on blue water resources we included in fig 3c a modified map from the brazilian water agency showing blue water stress total water demand divided by total water availability per micro basin ana 2013 the area where both most blue water use and yield increase because of irrigation happens is the northeast area of the country an area known for high levels of water stress due to its semi arid climate while the share of blue water in total water use is also high in southern areas of the country the higher water use does not translate to higher yields for the crops analyzed in this study these two areas northeast and outmost south are also areas known for high levels of water stress resulting from low local water availability fig 3c the areas with high blue water ratio in fig 3a but low yield increase in fig 3b are the areas in which there is a sizable increase of consumptive water use by the addition of irrigation but without a corresponding increase in productivity these are the areas where most of the reduction of water productivity from one scenario to the other happens the areas that could benefit the most from irrigation are those with high yield increase fig 3b but low rates of blue water figure b 3 3 water and land use under management scenarios during the period between 1990 and 2013 the production of the four selected crops grew from 46 thousand to 171 thousand tons per year in the same period the corresponding harvested area grew from 26 to 46 million hectares ibge 2018 assuming rainfed conditions for all crops we estimated the water use in the period 1990 2013 for all crops as shown in fig 4 as the share of harvested area for main and second season is not known for the entire study period we assumed all maize was planted as a single crop and therefore we multiplied the total measured harvested area for maize by the consumptive water use estimated for main season maize soybeans use the highest amount of water because of greater harvested area which has been expanding across the brazilian territory steadily in the last decades lathuillière et al 2014 estimated that the total green water use for soybean production in the state of mato grosso the state with the highest soybean production in brazil in 2004 was 28 km3 while we estimate here a close value of 30 km3 in the same year reaching 45 km3 in 2013 the observed increase in water footprints for maize and soybeans is directly related to increases in harvested area reported during this period we estimated the amount of resources necessary to obtain the same crop output during this period under the conditions simulated in the rainfed and irrigated high input scenarios when estimating changes in resource demand we assume that land sparing happens because of increase in land productivity and reduction of water demand because of reduction of cropland area and increase in water productivity in this context we define land and water demand reduction here as the percentage difference between the scenario derived and the actual cropland area and water use as seen in table 4 the average percentage of land demand reduction is higher in the irrigated scenario for all crops however the reduction in water demand are not necessarily higher in the irrigated scenario in fig 5 we show the amount of cropland and total water use required to produce the reported crop output in brazil for 1990 2013 for this study s selected crops the historical line refers to the amount of resources necessary to produce these crops under normal conditions the other lines refer to the amount of resources needed if they were produced with the productivity and resource use levels connected to the high input rainfed and irrigated scenarios results show that the gap between the actual and potential land and water use has decreased through the years as improved agricultural management and higher crop productivity becomes widespread in the country while in the irrigated scenario higher productivity requires less cropland and therefore lower green water use it also results in lower water productivity and the addition of blue water use as seen in fig 2 the amount of water used in the rainfed and irrigated scenarios fig 5 is very similar because of these two opposing effects that cancel each other as seen in table 4 the effects of irrigation and fertilization on water demand is highly dependent on the crop when adding up all crops the high input rainfed and irrigated scenarios ultimately result in a very similar level of water requirements even though the land requirements are a bit larger for the rainfed scenario independent results for each crop are presented in figures b 8 to b 11 in the supplementary material 4 discussion our analysis shows a picture of the trade offs and synergies for land and water use efficiency looking into different scenarios of irrigation and fertilization when it comes to changes in overall water use we see that cropland expansion was the main cause for the general increase of green water use in brazil mostly for production of soybeans the scenario analysis showed that agricultural intensification has the potential to enable the production of the same amount of output on a smaller area and with lower water requirements the main result of our study is the observed dominance and importance of green water as a resource for agriculture in brazil while cropland expansion can be seen as the additional appropriation of green water intensification can be seen as a strategy for better use of the green water available from the results we can see that the implementation of supplemental irrigation did not always result in comparable increases in productivity when compared to equivalent non irrigated scenarios this is due to the availability of green water during the growing season across most regions of the country but also a result of our modeling approach which assumed that crops were planted during that part of the year that was the least limited by lack of precipitation the areas in which our model showed that the benefits and relative importance of irrigation would be more pronounced are also areas known for semi arid conditions with high levels of blue water stress these are also the regions where most of the current irrigation infrastructure exists ana 2017 we have shown that in the case of water resources intensification is a pathway for improving the efficiency of water use with the consequence of sparing water use in either water stressed or water and biodiversity rich areas when it comes to greenhouse gas emissions burney et al 2010 showed that land sparing due to agricultural intensification outweighs the emissions related to intensification strategies it is important to highlight however that the focus here is to understand trade offs related to land and water use and therefore discount other possible environmental impacts that might result from agricultural intensification such as greenhouse gas emissions and water quality we were able to replicate the range of historical yields and observed water productivities with our setup of the epic model our results show that we have sufficient plasticity in our results to reconstruct a business as usual trajectory of yields we have also demonstrated see supplementary material that the estimated values for water productivity fall within the range of previously reported values lathuillière 2011 liu and yang 2010 mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 and the same can be said for yields ibge brazilian institute of geography and statistics 2018 mueller et al 2012 in the absence of spatially explicit crop specific data on fertilizer and irrigation water use we opted to explore a full range of possible management options it is important to highlight that the epic model lacks a lateral component i e it only represents vertical relationships in one particular field and neglects interconnection of more fields down the slope with this limitation it is not possible to consider any gain or loss of water due to lateral flow all our estimates are based on water balance at the site namely evapotranspiration vs rainfall this approach is coherent with the spatial scale of our study as lateral processes would have a bigger effect on the results in smaller scales despite the positive evaluation of the model several shortcomings remain in our modeling approach although intercropping is a common practice our model setup reflected only single cropping the inclusion of second season maize as a monocrop is a step towards modeling real double cropping systems yet very simplistic this approach can reveal certain aspects of the water consumption out of main season as we have witnessed in the results the modeling of double cropping is not the focus of this study yet it is definitely a very important aspect to be considered in future water consumption related studies the choice farmers make in the planting and harvesting dates as well as the choice of which crops will be grown depends on a series of factors that include weather international market prices and subsidies we assumed here that crop calendars vary in space but are static from year to year and are the same for all crop intensification scenarios yields and water footprints are particularly sensitive to start and length of the cropping season tuninetti et al 2015 our approach used documented cropping data sacks et al 2010 and attempted to remove uncertainties by selecting optimal calendar options however an interesting avenue of investigation would be to compare results based on crop calendars with different temporal and spatial resolutions the implementation of supplemental irrigation could also potentially extend the length of the available harvesting season or enable an increase in cropping frequency in certain areas lathuillière et al 2018 we did not consider these implications here and only focus on how productivity could change within the current average growing season one of the main factors that have allowed the expansion of crop cultivation to different parts of the territory and the improvement of land productivity is the development of a variety of cultivars adapted to different environments as well as the introduction of new pest control mechanisms another possible limitation of our modeling approach is that our model operates only with average and conservative cultivar parameters which are homogeneous for the study area 5 conclusions with our modeling framework we were able to replicate the range of historical yields and observed water productivities of cotton maize soybean and wheat in brazil green water was identified as the main water resource for the production of these crops the results also show that the yield increase related to nutrient stress reduction have the highest potential to improve green water productivity there is potential for irrigation of these crops in brazil with yield improvement resulting from supplemental irrigation yet the highest potential for irrigation mostly overlaps with areas with high levels of blue water stress the supplemental irrigation would result in several cases in reduction of the overall water productivity when compared to rain fed scenarios on the other side fertilizer related intensification is shown to result in steep improvements in green water productivity closing the yield gap through optimal fertilization and irrigation have the potential in brazil to reduce the demand for land and water in order of 34 58 of cropland area and 29 52 of total water requirement for the selected crop production in consideration of the overuse of blue water worldwide water rich countries like brazil act like vast reserves of green water that are available through global trade of agricultural products understanding the role brazil plays in contributing to global water use as well as the potential for reduction of water demand was one of the motivations of this study that is

10675,green water is a central resource for global agricultural production understanding its role is fundamental to design strategies to increase global food and feed production while avoiding further land conversion and obtaining more crop per drop brazil is a country with high water availability and a major exporter of agricultural goods and virtual water we assess here water use and water productivity in brazil for four major rainfed crops cotton maize soybeans and wheat for this we use the epic crop model to perform a spatially explicit assessment of consumptive water use and water productivity under crop management scenarios in brazil between 1990 and 2013 we investigate four different land water interactions i water use and productivity for different management scenarios ii the potential of supplemental irrigation for productivity improvement iii changes in green water use throughout the study period and finally iv potential reduction of land and water demand related to agricultural intensification the results show that for the studied crops green water is the main resource for biomass production and intensification can lead to great improvements in green water productivity the results also suggest that despite achieving higher yields irrigation based intensification tends to lower overall water productivity compared to fertilizer based intensification strategies this is however regionally and crop specific furthermore due to higher yields and water productivity producing the same amount of crop output in irrigated or rainfed intensification scenarios would result in the reduction of resource demand in the order of 34 58 for cropland and 29 52 for water keywords green water sustainability epic crop modeling water footprint 1 introduction increasing demands for food feed and bioenergy are a major challenge for securing water resources in the coming decades human activities have already overused blue water resources i e liquid water in rivers lakes wetlands and aquifers worldwide falkenmark and molden 2008 vörösmarty and sahagian 2000 wada and bierkens 2014 blue water scarcity limits the productivity of agricultural systems davis et al 2017 on the other side the use of green water i e soil water formed by precipitation and available to plants is about four to five times higher than blue water use in agriculture globally hoff et al 2010 while water science has mostly focused on estimating and managing blue water understanding how to make better use of green water resources is fundamental to meet future demands falkenmark and rockstrom 2006 water productivity is usually defined as the amount of crop yield obtained relative to the evapotranspiration of green and blue water during production improvement of water productivity is an important strategy to reduce the need for additional resources in both irrigated and rainfed systems molden et al 2010 on a global perspective commodity trade from areas with high water productivity to areas with lower productivity results in net water savings chapagain 2006 fader 2011 improving the management of green water and increasing green water productivity is desirable both in arid and water abundant areas rockström and barron 2007 higher crop yields can reduce the impact of agricultural systems by facilitating sparing of lands with high biodiversity phalan et al 2011 at the same time higher water productivities generate net water savings and reduce pressure in regions with higher water stress or scarcity fader et al 2011 existing water footprint studies have largely focused on impacts of water use on the location of production particularly in water stressed areas brazil has abundant blue and green water resources although the local availability of water is highly heterogeneous ana 2013 flach et al 2016 as a major agricultural producer and net exporter of agricultural commodities brazil exports about 54 8 billion m3 of virtual water per year mainly to europe da silva et al 2016 brazilian agriculture has undergone stark changes in the last decades through horizontal expansion and intensification dias et al 2016 zalles et al 2019 the expansion of brazilian cropland has been connected to increasing conversion of natural ecosystems and negative impacts to biodiversity and the water cycle bondeau et al 2007 gibbs et al 2010 spera et al 2016 zalles et al 2019 previous virtual water trade analysis of brazilian agriculture on a national scale used rather coarse datasets from available global water footprint assessments such as the one presented in the work of mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 da silva et al 2016 flach et al 2016 other water footprint and virtual water trade studies focused on smaller scales and regional scales mostly relying on local measurements albuquerque 2013 carvalho and menezes 2014 lathuillière et al 2018 2014 silva et al 2015 our present study is the first to model local agricultural water footprints for brazilian agriculture at a national scale employing a spatially explicit biophysical crop growth model at high spatial resolution with most recent input data we analyze land and water interactions for agricultural production in the recent past and for scenarios of agricultural management here we focus only on green and blue water we aim to understand the recent changes in green water use in brazilian agriculture but also possibilities for the future in particular the role that blue water can play in improving land and water productivity by providing spatially explicit and process based assessments of green and blue water in agriculture advanced crop models have enabled the progress of global water footprints and trade studies these biophysical models applied in global water assessments include gepic liu 2009 liu and yang 2010 gcwm siebert and döll 2008 h08 hanasaki et al 2013 konar et al 2016 lpjml fader et al 2010 gerten et al 2011 rost et al 2008 and wbmplus wisser et al 2008 with the use of the epic biophysical crop model and high resolution soil elevation and climate data we simulated 24 crop cycles between 1990 and 2013 for four traditionally rainfed crops cotton first and second season maize soybeans and wheat first we analyze how changes in nutrient input affect yields and water productivity and investigate how the intensification of food production in brazil affects agricultural water use productivity furthermore we estimate the geographical distribution of irrigation potential across the country lastly we analyzed the influence of agricultural intensification scenarios on the demand for water and land 2 materials and methods 2 1 the epic model the environmental policy integrated climate epic model simulates the biological physical and chemical processes that occur in the soil plant atmosphere management system at the field scale with a daily time step williams et al 2008 the model contains several modules which simulate processes related to weather hydrology erosion nutrients soil temperature plant growth plant environment control and tillage although originally designed to model soil erosion impacts on crop production epic has been used comprehensively to simulate climate change impacts nutrient cycling and loss soil carbon pesticide fate among others gassman et al 2004 epic has been used to model processes on regional and global scales via coupling with spatial data organized either within regular geographical grid e g gepic documented in liu 2009 or with the use of homogeneous response unit approaches e g in epic iiasa documented in balkovič et al 2014 previous studies have assessed impacts of crop management on yields and externalities across a range of management systems ranging from smallholder agriculture folberth et al 2012 to high input systems balkovič et al 2014 and has frequently been used to study crop water relations chun and li 2010 liu 2009 liu et al 2007 liu and yang 2010 the model has been validated across scales from the field to continental balkovič et al 2018 folberth et al 2012 and global studies müller et al 2017 epic has also been previously shown to be suitable to model brazilian agriculture barros et al 2005 2004 gaiser et al 2010 here the 0810 version of the model source code in fortran was compiled and modified for parallel processing in a linux environment to make it capable of iterative simulations over a large number of parameter settings 2 2 general modeling framework the epic model contains a large number of crop and model parameters it requires detailed input data on weather topography soil crop and crop management the calibration and validation of the model over large areas is a challenge since i there are usually no comprehensive experimental or independent data available that allow testing of the entire set of variables represented in the model for full range of conditions and ii aggregated data from regional statistics are usually insufficient as they do not represent field scale conditions balkovič et al 2013 we used an approach based on the methodology used in balkovič et al 2013 in which i the default biophysical process parameter values in epic were adopted with minor adjustments ii reviewed crop parameters based on average cultivar characteristics for the selected crops were used for the entire study area and iii sensitivity analysis and adjustment for main management parameters namely sowing dates length of growing season and potential heat units were performed to handle main sources of uncertainty this methodology ensured that the plasticity of the results we obtained were driven by crop management and not by improper setting of basic condition for crop growth this was achieved by reflecting the consistency between potential heat unit phu and planting harvesting dates and placing vegetation season to suitable parts of year with sufficient temperature sum for the crop as a result low yields are a result of low inputs or overall poor agro environmental climate and soil conditions not because of not reaching expected phus while data on fertilizer use has become more abundant and spatially explicit in recent years it is still limited in terms of temporal evolution for this reason we chose a scenario approach in our methodology which is described in section 2 5 when it comes to cultivar development and characteristics the availability of standardized documented data becomes even more limited especially considering the changes that have taken place during the study period adding a spatial and temporal cultivar component could have a great amount of uncertainty and our chosen approach was to apply homogeneous cultivar parameters based on values found in the literature while considering the use of regional cultivar maturity classes reflected in reported growing periods finally to reduce aggregation errors related to the biophysical input data we applied a homogeneous response unit approach described in further detail in section 2 3 the crop and model parameters used in the model runs as well as the homogeneous response units and the aggregated input data are

consumptive water use and production cotton maize soybeans and wheat these four crops are among the ten most important crops in terms of harvested area and total production in brazil they covered approximately 70 of the total harvested area in brazil in 2017 ibge 2018 we present further background information on agro hydro climatic conditions in brazil in figures a1 to a5 in the supplementary material irrigated agriculture in brazil is mostly connected to production of rice and sugarcane which together are responsible for 51 of total irrigated area the share of irrigated area relative to the total harvested area for soybean wheat maize and cotton are of 3 7 4 2 4 3 and 6 5 respectively fao 2017 here we first assumed the selected crops as produced solely in rainfed systems and on a later stage estimated how much blue water would be necessary to meet the crops water requirements with supplemental irrigation we modeled maize twice to represent two production systems the main maize crop and second maize crop called safrinha in brazil brazilian farmers commonly plant safrinha maize as a second crop after soybeans and therefore second season maize has a different calendar from main season maize our model setup does not simulate double cropping and instead simulates second season maize separately as a fifth crop the yield of maize soybeans and wheat correspond to the seed yield while the cotton yield corresponds to the sum of the lint and seed yields we simulated soil and water processes associated with crop growth in brazil between 1990 and 2013 the simulated area comprises only areas classified as cropland during the study period see fig 1 for this study the epic model was setup and run for more than 8 104 simulation units these units were classified primarily in terms of their biophysical homogeneity and then further delimited based on municipality administrative boundaries the procedure for delimitation of the simulation units was adapted from the methodology developed for the geobene global database for biophysical modeling skalsky et al 2008 first a homogeneous response unit hru is an area with similar soil topography and climate characteristics for delimitation of the hrus we classified the soil and topography databases based on predetermined thresholds see detailed description and thresholds in supplementary material the final boundaries of the simulation units resulted from the overlap of the climate dataset grid the municipality boundaries and the boundaries of the previously delimited hrus the resolution of the datasets used to delimitate the simulation units ranged from the 300 m resolution land use maps esa 2017 1 km resolution soil and topography datasets hengl et al 2014 jarvis et al 2008 and the 0 25 degrees climate grid xavier et al 2016 the municipal boundary shapefile divides the brazilian territory in approximately 6000 municipalities 2 4 simulation setup to reduce uncertainties related to the crop calendars an initial model run is performed to select optimal calendars based on planting and harvesting dates available in the dataset published in sacks et al 2010 this dataset includes time windows for the planting and harvesting season for different areas around the country we ran the model for non irrigated conditions with minimized nutrient stress for three different calendar options early mid and late planting and harvesting the option with higher yields for each crop and simulation unit was chosen we calculated the phu for each crop simulation unit and planting and harvesting window we initialized the model by carrying out spin up model runs for the period 1980 1990 to equilibrate the nutrient pools in soil comprising soil organic carbon and total and organic nitrogen and phosphorous the spin up runs generated soil profile values that were used as inputs to the final transient model runs the supplementary material provides further detail on the methodology for phu calculation model initialization and spin up model runs tables a 2 a 4 2 5 crop management scenarios with the lack of spatially and temporally explicit data on fertilizer use producing a business as usual reconstruction of yields in the scale of this study would not be possible therefore we designed water and fertilization scenarios in order to explore different outcomes within a space of possibilities for agricultural management we assumed here that the yield changes in the scenarios developed are dependent on water and nutrient availability and thus we designed the scenarios based on fertilizer and irrigation application we chose to consider irrigation and fertilizer application as these explain 60 80 of global yield variability for most major crops mueller et al 2012 we do not consider however other management options like tillage mulching pest control and cultivar development we simulated six different crop management scenarios depicting different combinations of fertilizer application and irrigation see table 1 the first scenario which we named no fertilization assumes crop management with no additional water or fertilizer input and aims to simulate how the production of the selected crops would be without any external input on the other side of the spectrum two scenarios called high input are designed to provide enough fertilizer input to minimize nutrient stress other two fertilizer scenarios were designed based on historical fertilizer application data called low input and mid input and are intended to mimic the input level of farms with intermediate cropping intensity the mid and high input scenarios were simulated both for irrigated and non irrigated conditions while the no fertilization and low input scenarios were simulated only for rainfed conditions the application rate values for nitrogen and phosphorus for the low and mid input scenarios were classified by identifying representative application rate values for brazil from mueller et al 2012 in the irrigation scenarios the model supplies irrigation water on each day in which the water stress factor exceeds 20 water stress trigger of 0 8 thus allowing a small degree of water stress for nitrogen application the model was set to provide nitrogen when nitrogen stress is above 20 nitrogen stress trigger of 0 8 with a pre determined application rate specific to each scenario when it comes to phosphorus the model was set to apply a certain application rate before planting the fertilizer levels and stress triggers used to set up each scenario are detailed in supplementary material tables a 3 and a 4 2 6 water use and efficiency indicators the model output of epic comprises detailed information on crop growth water nutrient and carbon fluxes in daily monthly and yearly steps for this study we focus on the estimated annual yield yd ton ha the growing season evapotranspiration gset mm and the amount of water provided by irrigation annually ir mm we chose to use the hargreaves method in the epic model for estimating evapotranspiration hargreaves and samani 1985 the blue water corresponds to the ir parameter and the green water corresponds to the total growing season evapotranspiration gset minus the water application through irrigation g r e e n w a t e r m m g s e t m m i r m m the consumptive water use cwu m3 yr crop water productivity wp kg m3 and virtual water content vwc m3 kg in a certain area are defined and calculated as follows in the main body of this article we analyze only consumptive water use and water productivity values in the supplementary material we also present the values of virtual water content for comparison with values previously reported in the literature c w u m 3 y r 10 g s e t m m y r a r e a s i m u h a w p k g m 3 100 y d t o n h a g s e t m m v w c m 3 t o n 10 g s e t m m y d t o n h a we aggregated the yields and water productivities from the simulation unit to the municipal level by calculating the weighted averages using the simulation unit area divided by the total simulation unit area in each municipality as weights we then aggregated them to the regional level using the harvested area per municipality divided by the total harvested area per region as weights to estimate the consumptive water use and water productivity for the historical scenario we used the simulated growing season evapotranspiration from the high input rainfed scenario aggregated at the municipal level and the reported yields between 1990 and 2013 ibge 2018 therefore we assume that the water use for production in this period comprises only rainfed agriculture and accounts only for green water use we calculated the potential for implementation of irrigation infrastructure ip using two different approaches first the potential for irrigation is described as the rate of yield increase between the irrigated and rainfed high input scenario ip1 as an indicator of the potential of supplemental irrigation to increase local crop productivity i p 1 100 y d h i i r r t o n h a y d h i r f t o n h a y d h i r f t o n h a in a second approach we assume that the more of blue water is necessary to meet the crop water requirements the higher the likelihood that farmers will make the choice to implement irrigation systems ip2 it is common to assume that irrigation systems will be implemented if the rate between blue and total water use is above a certain threshold usually around 10 dell angelo et al 2018 rosa et al 2018 accordingly we further estimate the potential for implementation of irrigation ip2 as the rate between blue and total consumptive water use during the cropping season i p 2 100 i r h i i r r m m g s e t h i i r r m m with the use of the estimated land and water productivity we calculated how much water and land would be necessary for each municipality to produce the same amount of crop output reported during the study period p r e p o r t e d k g y e a r for each scenario the reported production between 1990 and 2013 was obtained from ibge 2017 we calculated first the necessary area and consumptive water use for each municipality and then aggregated it to the national level the area was calculated with the use of the yields estimated by the model for each scenario while the consumptive water use relies on the water productivity levels estimated by the model for each scenario c w u s c e n a r i o m 3 y r p r e p o r t e d k g y r w p s c e n a r i o k g m 3 h a s c e n a r i o h a y r p r e p o r t e d k g y r y d s c e n a r i o k g h a by computing the difference between the water and land demand in each scenario and the actual water and land requirements we estimated the water and land demand reduction potential of each scenario d e m a n d r e d u

properties boer 2015 with a resolution of 1 km the topography maps for the area were obtained from the nasa shuttle radar topographic mission srtm 90 m digital elevation database v4 1 available through the consortium for spatial information cgiar csi of the consultative group for international agricultural research cgiar jarvis et al 2008 the cgiar csi srtm digital elevation models have a resolution of 90 m at the equator daily climate data on maximum and minimum temperature precipitation wind speed relative humidity and solar radiation between 1980 and 2013 for brazil were obtained from the database of daily gridded meteorological variables for brazil xavier et al 2016 with a spatial resolution of 15 arcminutes the mapping of cropland and harvested areas were obtained from two data sources the area delimited for cropland in general was based on the european space agency s climate change initiative land cover maps esa cci lc maps at the resolution of 1 km esa 2017 the harvested area and crop production per brazilian municipality were obtained from the brazilian statistics bureau ibge 2018 for around 5500 municipalities and all crops of interest between 1990 and 2015 the crop calendars were based on the publicly available data set of global planting date patterns developed by sacks et al 2010 we overlaid the datasets with classes of soil texture cropland area slope and altitude at the 1 km resolution to delimitate the simulation units which became the spatial units on which the model is run the crop calendars and weather data were used to calculate the phus necessary for the model setup the datasets of soil altitude crop calendar and weather were averaged by simulation unit area in order to produce the input files for the model 3 results 3 1 yields and water productivity the following section describes our results for consumptive water use and water productivities a detailed comparison of these results with previous studies and with reported data is provided in the supplementary material tables a 6 a 11 as expected higher nutrient and water application rates resulted in consistently higher simulated crop yields and higher water productivity values table 2 the average water productivity of irrigation scenarios is slightly lower than the water productivity of equivalent i e high input rainfed scenarios thus increased water input is likely to increase the amount of water per unit of output to assess the space for improvements in crop yields and water productivity we computed the yield difference between simulations of high input systems and reported municipal averages for entire brazil in the period 1990 2013 for the estimation of water productivity we used an average of the modelled growing season evapotranspiration for rainfed scenarios table 3 shows the spatial and temporal average of the growing season evapotranspiration for all crops for irrigated and rainfed scenarios the evapotranspiration of rainfed scenarios includes only green water while irrigated scenario footprints include both green and blue water fig 2 shows the simulated impacts of water and nutrient management on crop yields and water productivity supplementary irrigation leads to much smaller yield increases than supplementary fertilization for maize and wheat the average yield improvements of supplemental irrigation are mostly negligible however when analyzing the same data regionally we observe higher changes in the south and southeast regions for soybeans and in the northeast region for cotton see figs b 4 b 5 on the other hand we find that second season maize greatly increases yields across the territory which indicates that water availability could be one of the main limitations for double cropping expansion see figs 2 and b 3 while the average water productivities are smaller for irrigated scenarios compared to the corresponding rainfed scenario with the same level of fertilization in some cases irrigated yields are much higher e g cotton fig b 1 the highest yield increases for cotton occur in the northeast region this region also shows the steepest decreases in water productivities for both main and second season maize see figs b 2 b 3 for most crops the range of scenario results adequately covers the observed variability of the reported yields during the study period this agreement is especially noticeable for crops with moderate spatial variability such as wheat and cotton or presents reported and simulated homogeneous yield values such as soybeans on the other hand the high spatial variability of reported maize yields is not fully reproduced in our simulations fig 2 maize production is dispersed across a much larger number of municipalities and includes both smallholder and commercial farming 3 2 feasibility of supplemental irrigation the scenario results indicate that fertilization is generally more important for improving crop yields than irrigation however the benefits of supplemental irrigation and its influence on annual water use differ greatly between crops and locations in this section we analyze which crops and areas of the country could benefit more from additional blue water as well as where blue water would make up a larger share of total water demand fig 3 shows spatial differences between high input non irrigated and high input irrigated scenarios the ratio between blue and total water use depicts the share of irrigation water necessary for optimal plant growth fig 3a the potential yield changes fig 3b indicate regions that would benefit the most from supplemental irrigation to illustrate the potential pressure of irrigation on blue water resources we included in fig 3c a modified map from the brazilian water agency showing blue water stress total water demand divided by total water availability per micro basin ana 2013 the area where both most blue water use and yield increase because of irrigation happens is the northeast area of the country an area known for high levels of water stress due to its semi arid climate while the share of blue water in total water use is also high in southern areas of the country the higher water use does not translate to higher yields for the crops analyzed in this study these two areas northeast and outmost south are also areas known for high levels of water stress resulting from low local water availability fig 3c the areas with high blue water ratio in fig 3a but low yield increase in fig 3b are the areas in which there is a sizable increase of consumptive water use by the addition of irrigation but without a corresponding increase in productivity these are the areas where most of the reduction of water productivity from one scenario to the other happens the areas that could benefit the most from irrigation are those with high yield increase fig 3b but low rates of blue water figure b 3 3 water and land use under management scenarios during the period between 1990 and 2013 the production of the four selected crops grew from 46 thousand to 171 thousand tons per year in the same period the corresponding harvested area grew from 26 to 46 million hectares ibge 2018 assuming rainfed conditions for all crops we estimated the water use in the period 1990 2013 for all crops as shown in fig 4 as the share of harvested area for main and second season is not known for the entire study period we assumed all maize was planted as a single crop and therefore we multiplied the total measured harvested area for maize by the consumptive water use estimated for main season maize soybeans use the highest amount of water because of greater harvested area which has been expanding across the brazilian territory steadily in the last decades lathuillière et al 2014 estimated that the total green water use for soybean production in the state of mato grosso the state with the highest soybean production in brazil in 2004 was 28 km3 while we estimate here a close value of 30 km3 in the same year reaching 45 km3 in 2013 the observed increase in water footprints for maize and soybeans is directly related to increases in harvested area reported during this period we estimated the amount of resources necessary to obtain the same crop output during this period under the conditions simulated in the rainfed and irrigated high input scenarios when estimating changes in resource demand we assume that land sparing happens because of increase in land productivity and reduction of water demand because of reduction of cropland area and increase in water productivity in this context we define land and water demand reduction here as the percentage difference between the scenario derived and the actual cropland area and water use as seen in table 4 the average percentage of land demand reduction is higher in the irrigated scenario for all crops however the reduction in water demand are not necessarily higher in the irrigated scenario in fig 5 we show the amount of cropland and total water use required to produce the reported crop output in brazil for 1990 2013 for this study s selected crops the historical line refers to the amount of resources necessary to produce these crops under normal conditions the other lines refer to the amount of resources needed if they were produced with the productivity and resource use levels connected to the high input rainfed and irrigated scenarios results show that the gap between the actual and potential land and water use has decreased through the years as improved agricultural management and higher crop productivity becomes widespread in the country while in the irrigated scenario higher productivity requires less cropland and therefore lower green water use it also results in lower water productivity and the addition of blue water use as seen in fig 2 the amount of water used in the rainfed and irrigated scenarios fig 5 is very similar because of these two opposing effects that cancel each other as seen in table 4 the effects of irrigation and fertilization on water demand is highly dependent on the crop when adding up all crops the high input rainfed and irrigated scenarios ultimately result in a very similar level of water requirements even though the land requirements are a bit larger for the rainfed scenario independent results for each crop are presented in figures b 8 to b 11 in the supplementary material 4 discussion our analysis shows a picture of the trade offs and synergies for land and water use efficiency looking into different scenarios of irrigation and fertilization when it comes to changes in overall water use we see that cropland expansion was the main cause for the general increase of green water use in brazil mostly for production of soybeans the scenario analysis showed that agricultural intensification has the potential to enable the production of the same amount of output on a smaller area and with lower water requirements the main result of our study is the observed dominance and importance of green water as a resource for agriculture in brazil while cropland expansion can be seen as the additional appropriation of green water intensification can be seen as a strategy for better use of the green water available from the results we can see that the implementation of supplemental irrigation did not always result in comparable increases in productivity when compared to equivalent non irrigated scenarios this is due to the availability of green water during the growing season across most regions of the country but also a result of our modeling approach which assumed that crops were planted during that part of the year that was the least limited by lack of precipitation the areas in which our model showed that the benefits and relative importance of irrigation would be more pronounced are also areas known for semi arid conditions with high levels of blue water stress these are also the regions where most of the current irrigation infrastructure exists ana 2017 we have shown that in the case of water resources intensification is a pathway for improving the efficiency of water use with the consequence of sparing water use in either water stressed or water and biodiversity rich areas when it comes to greenhouse gas emissions burney et al 2010 showed that land sparing due to agricultural intensification outweighs the emissions related to intensification strategies it is important to highlight however that the focus here is to understand trade offs related to land and water use and therefore discount other possible environmental impacts that might result from agricultural intensification such as greenhouse gas emissions and water quality we were able to replicate the range of historical yields and observed water productivities with our setup of the epic model our results show that we have sufficient plasticity in our results to reconstruct a business as usual trajectory of yields we have also demonstrated see supplementary material that the estimated values for water productivity fall within the range of previously reported values lathuillière 2011 liu and yang 2010 mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 and the same can be said for yields ibge brazilian institute of geography and statistics 2018 mueller et al 2012 in the absence of spatially explicit crop specific data on fertilizer and irrigation water use we opted to explore a full range of possible management options it is important to highlight that the epic model lacks a lateral component i e it only represents vertical relationships in one particular field and neglects interconnection of more fields down the slope with this limitation it is not possible to consider any gain or loss of water due to lateral flow all our estimates are based on water balance at the site namely evapotranspiration vs rainfall this approach is coherent with the spatial scale of our study as lateral processes would have a bigger effect on the results in smaller scales despite the positive evaluation of the model several shortcomings remain in our modeling approach although intercropping is a common practice our model setup reflected only single cropping the inclusion of second season maize as a monocrop is a step towards modeling real double cropping systems yet very simplistic this approach can reveal certain aspects of the water consumption out of main season as we have witnessed in the results the modeling of double cropping is not the focus of this study yet it is definitely a very important aspect to be considered in future water consumption related studies the choice farmers make in the planting and harvesting dates as well as the choice of which crops will be grown depends on a series of factors that include weather international market prices and subsidies we assumed here that crop calendars vary in space but are static from year to year and are the same for all crop intensification scenarios yields and water footprints are particularly sensitive to start and length of the cropping season tuninetti et al 2015 our approach used documented cropping data sacks et al 2010 and attempted to remove uncertainties by selecting optimal calendar options however an interesting avenue of investigation would be to compare results based on crop calendars with different temporal and spatial resolutions the implementation of supplemental irrigation could also potentially extend the length of the available harvesting season or enable an increase in cropping frequency in certain areas lathuillière et al 2018 we did not consider these implications here and only focus on how productivity could change within the current average growing season one of the main factors that have allowed the expansion of crop cultivation to different parts of the territory and the improvement of land productivity is the development of a variety of cultivars adapted to different environments as well as the introduction of new pest control mechanisms another possible limitation of our modeling approach is that our model operates only with average and conservative cultivar parameters which are homogeneous for the study area 5 conclusions with our modeling framework we were able to replicate the range of historical yields and observed water productivities of cotton maize soybean and wheat in brazil green water was identified as the main water resource for the production of these crops the results also show that the yield increase related to nutrient stress reduction have the highest potential to improve green water productivity there is potential for irrigation of these crops in brazil with yield improvement resulting from supplemental irrigation yet the highest potential for irrigation mostly overlaps with areas with high levels of blue water stress the supplemental irrigation would result in several cases in reduction of the overall water productivity when compared to rain fed scenarios on the other side fertilizer related intensification is shown to result in steep improvements in green water productivity closing the yield gap through optimal fertilization and irrigation have the potential in brazil to reduce the demand for land and water in order of 34 58 of cropland area and 29 52 of total water requirement for the selected crop production in consideration of the overuse of blue water worldwide water rich countries like brazil act like vast reserves of green water that are available through global trade of agricultural products understanding the role brazil plays in contributing to global water use as well as the potential for reduction of water demand was one of the motivations of this study that is particularly important considering the extent of the recent horizontal expansion of brazilian agriculture which resulted in larger land and water resources use as well as displacement of natural

10676,many agricultural communities depend on groundwater irrigation as a supplemental or primary water source however groundwater resources are finite and depletion can make continued irrigation inviable when modeling the economic impacts of future aquifer decline studies often assume that irrigated cropland will transition uniformly to dryland crop production in reality irrigation has allowed crops to be grown across a wider range of soil and climate conditions than can support dryland crop production here we test the agronomic and economic importance of this assumption by mapping the spatiotemporal distribution of anticipated future irrigation losses across the ogallala or high plains aquifer usa at annual 30 m resolution we then develop a land use suitability model to determine whether these lands would transition to dryland agriculture or pasture use we find that 22 000 km2 24 of currently irrigated lands in the high plains aquifer may be unable to support irrigated agriculture by 2100 and 13 of these areas are not suitable for dryland crop production due primarily to low quality soils to quantify the farm scale and regional scale economic importance of land use suitability we selected six case study counties across the aquifer and modeled farm and community scale economic outcomes gross revenue and value added respectively with and without consideration of land use suitability we find that not accounting for land use suitability leads to an overestimate of economic benefits in transitioned land by 12 45 with variability across counties primarily driven by the distribution of soil capability dryland crop mix and local economic factors notably this implies that the economic impacts of land transitions are not directly proportional to area lost but rather mediated by underlying variability in these three factors our analyses highlight the importance of considering local biophysical constraints in planning for future land use trajectories community and regional land use planning needs to incorporate the possibility that irrigated cropland may transition to non irrigated pasture production rather than dryland crop production which can have substantial biophysical and economic impacts keywords high plains aquifer groundwater depletion water management soil capability land use transitions economic impacts 1 introduction groundwater resources are facing multiple pressures including increasing food demand expanding urban areas and changing climates agricultural production and communities are disproportionately impacted by increased competition for groundwater which represents 42 of the water used for agriculture globally and supports 60 of u s irrigated agricultural production döll et al 2012 siebert et al 2010 while improvements in water use efficiency and conservation can reduce agriculture s groundwater consumption some groundwater resources are non renewable on any meaningful timeline for human use due to biophysical constraints that limit recharge regions with declining groundwater sources such as large portions of the ogallala aquifer region will need viable paths for transitioning away from groundwater dependence that cause the least disruption to residents and the local economy the ogallala aquifer is the largest unit of the hydrologically connected high plains aquifer system hereafter referred to as the hpa the largest freshwater aquifer in the world that underlies 450 660 km2 across eight states thelin and heimes 1987 it provides the main source of agricultural and public water supplies that has sustained economic development in the region for more than 80 years in the early 20th century conversion of native grasslands to annual non irrigated crop production and prolonged drought led to the dust bowl of the 1930s mcleman et al 2014 the adoption of irrigation and soil conservation methods transformed agriculture and expanded the region s economy while reducing soil erosion however the hpa is an exhaustible resource while some regions particularly in the northern high plains can achieve sustainable groundwater pumping levels while still supporting irrigated agriculture through conservation efforts regions with low recharge rates and high evaporative demands common in the southern high plains and the western portions of the central and northern high plains regions are likely to see declining groundwater levels even with the best conservation practices mcguire 2017 scanlon et al 2012 generally irrigated crop production is assumed to be impractical once aquifer saturated thickness drops below 9 m 30 ft due to low well yield rawling and rinehart 2018 schloss et al 2002 under status quo management and climate the proportion of the aquifer below this threshold is predicted to grow from 25 to 40 between 2012 and 2100 haacker et al 2016 there are several forces that could affect this timeline to depletion including climate change and producer adaptation historical analysis of land use variations in the u s great plains shows that many land use systems continuously adapt to climate and biophysical changes in response to socioeconomic drivers land use legacies and regional land use traditions drummond et al 2012 it is likely that producers will adapt by shifting crop choice and irrigation practices to slow the rate of decline and extend aquifer life haacker et al 2019 manning et al 2017 schuck et al 2005 through both self organization butler et al 2018 deines et al 2019a and top down restrictions hrozencik et al 2017 climate change in contrast will likely shorten the timeline due to warming temperatures increased crop evaporative losses and increased frequency and duration of prolonged droughts that will increase the need for groundwater resources to support crop production cotterman et al 2018 while the time to depletion is challenging to predict precisely the spatial distribution of regions where depletion will first occur is more certain due to observable variation in saturated thickness and historic depletion trajectories thus it is more a question of when than whether communities will need to develop strategies to sustain their livelihoods without reliance on groundwater for irrigated crop production for these communities an integrated assessment is needed to evaluate potential future land management options and the associated regional economic impacts when modeling future groundwater use and aquifer decline studies often assume that irrigated cropland will transition to dryland crop production e g amosson et al 2009 cotterman et al 2018 dobrowolski and engle 2016 wheeler et al 2008 however irrigation has allowed crops to be grown across a wider range of soil and climate conditions than can support dryland crop production recent evidence suggests that an appreciable proportion of irrigated cropland may transition to pasture rather than dryland crop production due to biophysical limiting factors such as soil quality golden and guerrero 2017 golden and johnson 2013 however the extent to which these factors affect areas projected to be depleted and the associated economic impacts of these limits remains unknown due to a lack of spatially explicit data on the areas in question here we evaluated the degree to which projected economic outcomes associated with transitioning out of irrigated agriculture change when land use suitability is incorporated into the accounting process to quantify the economic impacts of irrigation curtailment we first identified currently irrigated land that would no longer support irrigation through 2100 due to groundwater depletion including the estimated year in which irrigation would become nonviable we then developed a land use suitability model to predict the appropriate non irrigated land use for these areas based on the soil properties of current pasture and rainfed cropland using a case study approach we estimated the potential economic impact of these different land use practices on producer profitability and regional economics for a high priority county in each of six states with appreciable irrigated area sourced from the aquifer in the 21st century reduced well outputs coupled with prolonged drought events have already led to dust storms in the southern high plains region reminiscent of the dust bowl gaskill 2012 our analysis can inform strategic planning to sustain rural communities and avoid a second dust bowl in this ecologically vulnerable region 2 methods 2 1 quantifying annual losses in irrigated land through 2100 we used recently available gridded datasets of groundwater depletion and irrigated areas to estimate future irrigation losses by year at 30 m resolution across the aquifer haacker et al 2016 projected the year of groundwater depletion for the full hpa by linearly extrapolating annual decline rates between 1993 2012 through year 2300 at 250 m resolution haacker et al 2016 defined the year of functional depletion for each grid cell as the year in which the extrapolated saturated thickness fell below a viability threshold of 9 m this represented a minimum saturated thickness required for high capacity wells based on discussion with state agencies and irrigators in kansas hecox et al 2002 schloss et al 2002 these depletion projections indicate the area unable to support irrigation may increase from 25 to 40 between 2012 and 2100 fig 1 a haacker et al 2016 this linear extrapolation approach represents a business as usual scenario and does not account for dynamic management responses to water decline behavior changes induced by increased pumping costs or reduced well yields new technologies that may increase water use efficiency or changes in climate additionally the 9 m saturated thickness threshold may not be a uniform predictor of groundwater irrigation feasibility given heterogeneity in other aquifer properties e g specific yield to check its reasonableness we summarized the distribution of saturated thicknesses in 2016 underlying actively irrigated lands between 2015 2017 see below we found that although the vast majority of irrigated area occurs above this threshold approximately 8 14 and 24 of irrigated area in the northern central and southern high plains respectively occurs below this 9 m threshold fig s1 while the exact date of depletion will likely differ from the haacker et al 2016 predictions our analysis still focuses on the portions of the hpa which are likely to be depleted first given the current saturated thickness and rates of decline and therefore provides an estimate of the potential magnitude of the biophysical and economic impacts of transitions to pasture rather than rainfed cropland we identified currently irrigated land using recently published maps of annual irrigation over the hpa derived from landsat satellite data at 30 m resolution the aim hpa dataset deines et al 2019b this dataset spans 1984 2017 has an accuracy of 91 4 compared to over 17 000 ground truth point locations and shows strong agreement with county statistics from the 5 yr us agricultural census r2 0 86 here we used these maps to generate a new layer of currently active irrigation defined as any area classified as irrigated between 2015 2017 fig 1b we used this 3 year span to capture fields which may have been in a fallow rotation or only partially irrigated in any single year we then used the depletion map to identify irrigated pixels likely to transition out of irrigated production by 2100 due to groundwater depletion and assigned these pixels a curtailment year based on the year in which saturated thickness was projected to drop below 9 m we assumed that all irrigation overlying depletion zones is sourced from groundwater not surface water to test the validity of this assumption we compared the percent of irrigated area projected to be lost by 2100 to the percentage of irrigation which is sourced from groundwater dieter et al 2018 by county we found that all counties have a higher proportion of groundwater irrigation than the proportion of land expected to be depleted by 2100 fig s2 supporting our assumption that transitioned lands were sourced from groundwater the resulting map of projected year of irrigation curtailment is unique in that it explicitly locates the year and location of irrigation curtailment allowing us to assess non irrigated land use alternatives based on location specific soil properties and to estimate economic impacts by year through 2100 2 2 land use suitability analysis to determine whether depleted areas would transition into pasture or dryland agriculture we developed a land use suitability model to predict the appropriate non irrigated land use based on the soil properties of current pasture and dryland crops first we used our map of current 2015 2017 irrigation to isolate non irrigated cropland and pasture from the usda cropland data layer cdl land use maps usda national agricultural statistics service 2018 to do so we used the 2017 cdl cultivated layer boryan et al 2012 which identifies all cultivated land from 2013 to 2017 to comprehensively locate cultivated and non cultivated land areas we then used the 2017 cdl to retain only pasture non cultivated land cover removing forests wetlands water and urban areas any land enrolled in the conservation reserve program in 2015 as identified by a spatial data layer obtained from the usda national resources conservation service through a freedom of information act request was removed to avoid confounding the analysis with land suitable for cropland but currently under conservation status and possibly classified as grassland in the cdl from this resulting map of non irrigated cropland and pasture we randomly generated 40 000 sampling points across the aquifer at each point we extracted the latitude longitude and field slope calculated from a digital elevation model u s geological survey 2017 and non irrigated land capability class and subclass values from the gssurgo soil database soil capability for brevity usda natural resources conservation service 2017 the soil capability scale ranges from 1 best for agriculture to 8 worst for agriculture a soil capability rating of 5 is defined as soils which have little or no hazard of erosion but have other limitations that limit their use mainly to pasture range forestland or wildlife food and cover soil classes are also subdivided into four subclasses based on climate erosion root zone soil limitations and excess water based on preliminary analyses using the 2017 cdl and our irrigation layer 93 of current dryland agriculture in the study area occurs where the soil capability 5 but 31 of pastureland also occurs below this threshold figs s3 and s4 we then randomly split the sampled points into training and validation subsets 50 to each group and trained a random forest classifier to create a binary prediction for dryland crops vs pasture based on these soil classes field slope and spatial location latitude and longitude random forests are ensemble classifiers that generate predictions based on the consensus of multiple decision trees each parameterized with a random subset of variables and training samples we selected this classifier because they are demonstrably fast accurate robust to variable collinearity and overfitting and straightforward to implement belgiu and drăgu 2016 the resulting overall classification accuracy evaluated on the validation data points was 82 with 85 and 78 of test points correctly classified for dryland crops and pasture respectively the full accuracy table is presented in table s1 soil capability class slope and latitude ranked highest among variable importance metrics measuring contributions to classification accuracy fig s5 we then applied this land use suitability model to the full aquifer at 30 m resolution to obtain suitable land uses for areas predicted to transition from irrigated agriculture finally we tallied the total area of transitions from irrigation to each of dryland cropping and pasture classes by county for 157 counties fully covered by the aim hpa irrigation map product which was produced with a 15 km buffer around the aquifer 2 3 county scale economic analysis to demonstrate the importance of accounting for land use suitability when planning for transitions away from irrigated cropland we selected one county from each of six ogallala states with appreciable aquifer fed irrigation for the economic analyses fig 1 table 1 counties within each state were ranked by the percentage of current irrigated area projected to transition to pasture we then selected the county with the highest percent transitioning to pasture with the exception of texas where the 2nd ranked county dallam county was selected due to the availability of economic data therefore our case study examples were developed to demonstrate the largest impacts within each state and provide an upper bound for the error associated with the common assumption that all irrigated land will transition to non irrigated crop production when groundwater supplies are depleted economic and land use suitability models were linked through time to estimate temporal land use changes and corresponding economic impacts in response to changes in groundwater availability two scenarios were evaluated referred to as the simple scenario and the land use suitability scenario the simple scenario assumed that 100 of land transitioning out of irrigation will shift to dryland crop production regardless of land use suitability this assumption is consistent with the dominant approach to date e g amosson et al 2009 cotterman et al 2018 dobrowolski and engle 2016 wheeler et al 2008 the land use suitability scenario uses the land use suitability model described in section 2 2 to partition transitioning areas in to either dryland crop production or dryland pasture production based on underlying soil and physiographic properties thus the differences between the two scenarios represent the economic impact typically overlooked by studies that do not take land use suitability into account and assume all land will transition to dryland crop production by focusing on the difference in scenario outcomes our approach buffers against the effects of our simplifying assumptions regarding groundwater hydrology and change in irrigated crop revenues over time since our results are based on the difference in scenarios both of which use the same underlying assumptions thus this research only considers the economics associated with the land area transitioning to non irrigated production we consider two economic metrics for emerging dryland crop and pasture areas due to aquifer depletion the gross revenue and the community economic impact value added see below in order to generate the economic metrics we assumed that the future proportions of dryland crop types would remain similar to the present day crop mix to quantify this we found the average area for each crop type by county between 2013 2017 based on the areas of annual cdl crop layers not classified as irrigated in the aim hpa irrigation maps table 1 provides the average percentage of major dryland crops by county as well as the percent of total dryland acreage these major crops cover while there are other non irrigated crops grown in these counties the major crops account for between 95 2 and 98 3 of non irrigated cropland we then estimated weighted average gross revenues per hectare based on county specific crop production budgets as an example the kansas state university agricultural experiment station and cooperative extension service annually develops farm management guide crop budgets since there can be large annual variations in commodity prices and input costs we used a 5 year average from 2013 2017 we estimated the gross revenue for pasture based on a previous analysis for finney county kansas asem hiablie et al 2015 in this region pasture is primarily used for cow calf operations which raise animals for later sale to concentrated feeding operations specifically we assume that each cow calf unit requires 15 6 ha that the calf weaning weight is 250 kg and a 7 year average future price of 3 44 per kg these data result in an expected gross revenue for pastureland of 54 29 per hectare the gross revenues for the remaining counties were adjusted based on a ratio of average annual rainfall relative to finney county so that precipitation is used as a proxy for non irrigated pasture productivity for example the gross revenue in dallam county was calculated by multiplying the gross revenue in finney county by the ratio of average annual rainfall in dallam county compared to finney county it was assumed that these gross revenues would be obtained the first year of conversion to evaluate the community economic impacts beyond direct farm revenue of each scenario we used these gross returns as input to a regional economic impact model impact analysis for planning implan implan group llc 2013 we used value added as the metric of regional economic impact bbc research et al 1996 thorvaldson and pritchett 2006 value added is calculated by multiplying dryland crop and pasture revenues by a land use specific regional impact factor table 1 value added consists of four components 1 employment compensation wage salary and benefits paid by employers 2 proprietor income payments received by self employed individuals as income 3 other property income payments to individuals in the form of rent and 4 indirect business taxes all taxes with the exception of income tax we adapted work by golden and guerrero 2017 that estimated multipliers for non irrigated crops in southwest kansas and used implan to generate pasture land multipliers based on the beef cattle ranching and farming sector table 1 finally we compared gross revenues and community economic impacts for the simple scenario and land use suitability scenario for each of the six counties through 2100 3 results and discussion 3 1 land use transitions across the high plains aquifer 3 1 1 irrigation losses based on maps of projected groundwater depletion and current irrigated area we estimated that 22 000 km2 24 of currently irrigated lands in the hpa will be unable to support irrigated agriculture by 2100 fig 1 fig 2 a shows irrigated area losses aggregated to the county level across the aquifer the majority of these losses occur in the central and southern high plains which may lose 9500 and 7500 km2 respectively this is equivalent to 40 of currently irrigated area in the central high plains and 54 for the southern high plains in contrast the northern high plains is projected to lose only 10 of currently irrigated area the more humid north central and eastern portions of the aquifer will likely experience far less depletion induced losses due to higher annual rainfall and natural recharge scanlon et al 2012 although it s worth noting that irrigated area continues to expand in these regions deines et al 2019b and may alter future rates of extraction we also found different patterns of irrigation loss through time among the hpa regions in the southern high plains 80 of losses occur prior to 2060 midway through our study time period in contrast the central high plains sees 53 of losses by this time in the northern high plains where natural recharge is highest 56 of losses occur between 2060 2100 in the latter half of the study period our method implicitly also assumes that irrigated crop producers transition to rainfed agriculture only as a result of the lack of available groundwater however a profit maximizing producer may make the transition when the net profit of rainfed production exceeds the net profit of irrigated crop production as a result this analysis may underestimate the rate of transition particularly as pumping costs increase with water table decline foster et al 2017 our estimates agree fairly well with existing projections of lost irrigated area in parts of the aquifer scanlon et al 2012 estimated that 35 of the southern high plains would lose irrigation within 30 years we estimate a 32 loss for 2042 cotterman et al 2018 project that 60 of area irrigated for corn and 50 of area irrigated for wheat will be lost in the central high plains by 2099 our estimate for all irrigated area in this region is lower 40 although we consider all irrigated crop types which could account for some discrepancy it s likely our use of a higher resolution irrigation layer 30 m compared to the lower 250 m resolution layer they use provides a more refined estimate of current irrigated areas 3 1 2 non irrigated land use suitability we were able to predict suitable dryland land use with 82 accuracy using the random forest model trained on soil capability classes field slope and location table s1 from this land use suitability model we estimated that 87 of lost irrigated area through 2100 could support dryland crop production while the remaining 13 is better suited to pasture use this percentage is relatively consistent across aquifer regions figs 1 2b with 12 860 km2 of lost area suitable for pasture in the southern high plains and 14 in both the central high plains 1400 km2 and northern high plains 680 km2 these areas are also distributed fairly uniformly across depletion timeframes with similar percentages suitable for pasture for areas lost before and after 2060 14 and 13 respectively the land capability classification system that informed this analysis was primarily developed as a response to the dust bowl of the 1930s to prioritize conservation efforts on soils with high erosion potential helms 1992 thus our results suggest that a substantial proportion 13 of lands facing groundwater depletion across the entire aquifer region may again be priority areas for targeted conservation programs to avoid wind erosion events forethought will be particularly important to support the transition highly erodible lands can be stabilized by the establishment of perennial vegetation due to their extensive root systems that can improve soil structure water infiltration and increase soil organic matter levels durán zuazo and rodríguez pleguezuelo 2008 however establishing slower growing perennial pastures can be difficult on erodible lands in the absence of irrigation water porensky et al 2014 these soils tend to have low water holding capacity and erosion events can readily kill vulnerable seedlings hence the quality of the soil will likely dictate the future land use options and these differing options may require proactive transitions to establish perennial vegetation prior to the loss of irrigation 3 2 county case studies 3 2 1 county land use transitions while the land area more suitable for pasture under non irrigated management is evenly distributed through depletion timeframes and within larger hpa regions some counties will be impacted more than others fig 2b here we selected one county from each of six states overlying the hpa to examine land use transitions in detail and estimate the economic impacts of failing to account for land use suitability when planning for irrigation curtailment fig 3 provides the annual changes in depleted irrigated area suitable for dryland cropping and pasture uses for each case study county we estimate that dallam county tx finney county ks and texas county ok will lose 65 57 and 55 of their currently irrigated cropland through 2100 due to groundwater depletion with smaller losses of 30 in dundy county ne and roosevelt county nm and 27 in yuma county co fig 3 in terms of magnitude of area lost dundy and roosevelt counties will lose only 130 150 km2 while texas and finney counties will both lose over 500 km2 and dallam county is projected to lose over 760 km2 based on the land use suitability model the percent of current irrigation projected to become pasture rather than dryland crops for these counties ranged from 6 3 in texas county ok to 19 in dallam county tx fig 2b looking specifically at areas facing groundwater depletion we estimated that at least one third of lost irrigated area through 2100 is more suitable for pasture than crop production systems in dundy county ne 42 66 km2 yuma county co 34 120 km2 and roosevelt county nm 33 46 km2 smaller percentages were more suitable for pasturelands in dallam county tx 28 220 km2 finney county ks 18 110 km2 and texas county ok 11 62 km2 these future anticipated reversions to non irrigated pasture may partially counteract recent cropland expansion which was preferentially concentrated on former grassland and less suitable soils lark et al 2015 3 2 2 the influence of land use suitability on economic impacts we estimated that gross revenues for dryland crop production are 10 8 times greater than for pasture on average across the 6 case study counties illustrating why previous analyses have assumed that transitioned land will be converted to dryland crops rather than pasture the revenue difference for individual counties ranging from 3 7 15 5 this spread arises from the considerable variability in dryland crop revenues among counties ranging from 195 ha in roosevelt county nm to 798 ha in dundy county ne table 1 this is likely due to rainfall and temperature gradients across the aquifer that influence dryland crop mix as well as local economic factors pasture revenues were more consistent across counties table 1 in part due to our assumption of a consistent animal density across counties by comparing the simple scenario and the land use suitability scenario section 2 3 we were able to quantify the economic implications of ignoring soil limits on future land uses in depleted areas we found that ignoring land use suitability considerations in economic models of future agricultural revenues would overestimate cumulative gross revenue from transitioning land by 23 3 across all six counties by 2100 a difference of 1 54 billion for these six counties alone across individual counties overestimations ranged from 12 to 45 table 2 fig 4 these estimates are likely conservative because they predict revenue generation in the first year following a transition to pasture but it can take several years before newly established perennial pastures in a dryland environment can support grazing and achieve peak productivity cook et al 2012 because our estimates of the regional impact factors for dryland crops and pastureland spanned a limited range across our focal counties 0 5 0 64 table 1 the community economic impacts as measured by value added see section 2 3 were similar in range to the gross revenues as a percent difference between scenarios table 3 averaged across the six counties we found a cumulative difference of 23 5 through 2100 between scenarios or an absolute difference of 887 million thus the economic impact of land transitions will ripple through rural economies with implications for sustaining livelihoods beyond the farm due to the large differences in gross revenues and smaller differences in regional impact factors between dryland crop and pasture lands the gross revenue differences will be the primary driver of community economic impacts consequently taking land use suitability into consideration suggests that communities with more land transitioning to pastures will face a more difficult economic transition away from irrigation in all counties annual differences between scenarios increased with time though with different temporal signatures which are reflective of the interplay between irrigation depletion and land use suitability fig 5 for instance in yuma and finney counties the simple and land use suitability scenarios are identical for the next several decades before diverging in the 2030s yuma county and 2050s finney county this indicates that near term depletion driven transitions will primarily be on higher quality soils capable of supporting dryland crops while long term depletion driven transitions will be concentrated on lower quality soils see also fig 3 in contrast the two scenarios diverge almost immediately in dundy and dallam counties fig 5 indicating near term loss of irrigation in lower quality soils in all counties however the difference between the simple scenario and land use suitability scenario grows larger through time reflecting the increasing aggregate area converted to pasture over time combined these results suggest that land use conversions will impact future generations more than the current generation similarly it indicates that the error caused by failing to account for land use suitability particularly soil quality in economic planning models will have significant spatial and temporal variability though errors generally will increase over time it is also worth noting that lost irrigated area is not directly proportional to the economic impact e g fig 4 for example dundy county ne would lose only 15 600 ha of irrigated area but due to the high percentage of land unsuitable for dryland crops 42 and high ratio of crop to pasture revenue where cropland has 15 5x higher gross revenue than pasture these losses lead to 220 million difference in gross revenue between scenarios roosevelt county nm on the other hand would lose a similar 13 600 ha of irrigated area but its lower percentage of pasture suitable land 33 and lower crop pasture revenue 3 7 result in only a 33 million difference between scenarios this emphasizes the variable impact land use suitability can have across space and the importance of local scale modeling to understand the economic implications of aquifer depletion 4 conclusions groundwater depletion threatens the viability of irrigated agriculture across the high plains aquifer particularly in the southern central and western regions local economies need information on the timing scale and plausible replacement land uses in order to plan for diminishing irrigation capabilities here we developed a high resolution map time series projecting annual irrigation losses across the hpa through 2100 and find that 24 of current irrigated acreage may undergo a forced transition to dryland crops or pasture by 2100 due to groundwater depletion by mapping the locations of these losses we were able to estimate likely non irrigated land use for these transitioning irrigated areas based on underlying soil and physiographic properties overall our land use suitability model indicated that 13 of these future depleted areas would be unable to support dryland crop production these limitations are not typically recognized in studies to date instead all irrigated lands are generally assumed to transition to dryland cropping using six county scale case studies we found that soil driven land use suitability limitations which would require conversion to pasture rather than dryland crops can reduce future revenue by an order of magnitude overall failing to account for land use suitability can underestimate economic impacts of aquifer depletion by 12 45 depending on county attributes moreover these economic impacts are not directly proportional to the area of irrigation losses largely reflecting differences in the dryland crop types able to be grown in different settings we made several simplifying assumptions to demonstrate the importance of land use suitability the future is dynamic and unknown changes in irrigation technology dominant crop mixes farmer behavior and climate could all affect our depletion timeframes as well as county economic parameters climate change in particular is likely to impact the study region and alter historical water extraction rates and cropping patterns for example climate change has and will continue to shift the geographic range suitable for different dryland crops cho and mccarl 2017 and is expected to alter crop yields cotterman et al 2018 in addition future climate scenario analyses suggest that some areas may be unable to support even pastureland possibly shifting to even less productive shrublands sohl et al 2019 agricultural systems are coupled human natural systems liu et al 2007 characterized by feedbacks surprises and complex global connections through food supply chains and international trade dalin et al 2017 for example land use can provide positive or negative feedbacks to groundwater levels since studies have found that groundwater recharge drops substantially between irrigated and dryland cropping systems and that grasslands or pasture have lower recharge than either cropping system scanlon et al 2012 riley et al 2019 future work should seek to capture these system dynamics to better understand

10676,many agricultural communities depend on groundwater irrigation as a supplemental or primary water source however groundwater resources are finite and depletion can make continued irrigation inviable when modeling the economic impacts of future aquifer decline studies often assume that irrigated cropland will transition uniformly to dryland crop production in reality irrigation has allowed crops to be grown across a wider range of soil and climate conditions than can support dryland crop production here we test the agronomic and economic importance of this assumption by mapping the spatiotemporal distribution of anticipated future irrigation losses across the ogallala or high plains aquifer usa at annual 30 m resolution we then develop a land use suitability model to determine whether these lands would transition to dryland agriculture or pasture use we find that 22 000 km2 24 of currently irrigated lands in the high plains aquifer may be unable to support irrigated agriculture by 2100 and 13 of these areas are not suitable for dryland crop production due primarily to low quality soils to quantify the farm scale and regional scale economic importance of land use suitability we selected six case study counties across the aquifer and modeled farm and community scale economic outcomes gross revenue and value added respectively with and without consideration of land use suitability we find that not accounting for land use suitability leads to an overestimate of economic benefits in transitioned land by 12 45 with variability across counties primarily driven by the distribution of soil capability dryland crop mix and local economic factors notably this implies that the economic impacts of land transitions are not directly proportional to area lost but rather mediated by underlying variability in these three factors our analyses highlight the importance of considering local biophysical constraints in planning for future land use trajectories community and regional land use planning needs to incorporate the possibility that irrigated cropland may transition to non irrigated pasture production rather than dryland crop production which can have substantial biophysical and economic impacts keywords high plains aquifer groundwater depletion water management soil capability land use transitions economic impacts 1 introduction groundwater resources are facing multiple pressures including increasing food demand expanding urban areas and changing climates agricultural production and communities are disproportionately impacted by increased competition for groundwater which represents 42 of the water used for agriculture globally and supports 60 of u s irrigated agricultural production döll et al 2012 siebert et al 2010 while improvements in water use efficiency and conservation can reduce agriculture s groundwater consumption some groundwater resources are non renewable on any meaningful timeline for human use due to biophysical constraints that limit recharge regions with declining groundwater sources such as large portions of the ogallala aquifer region will need viable paths for transitioning away from groundwater dependence that cause the least disruption to residents and the local economy the ogallala aquifer is the largest unit of the hydrologically connected high plains aquifer system hereafter referred to as the hpa the largest freshwater aquifer in the world that underlies 450 660 km2 across eight states thelin and heimes 1987 it provides the main source of agricultural and public water supplies that has sustained economic development in the region for more than 80 years in the early 20th century conversion of native grasslands to annual non irrigated crop production and prolonged drought led to the dust bowl of the 1930s mcleman et al 2014 the adoption of irrigation and soil conservation methods transformed agriculture and expanded the region s economy while reducing soil erosion however the hpa is an exhaustible resource while some regions particularly in the northern high plains can achieve sustainable groundwater pumping levels while still supporting irrigated agriculture through conservation efforts regions with low recharge rates and high evaporative demands common in the southern high plains and the western portions of the central and northern high plains regions are likely to see declining groundwater levels even with the best conservation practices mcguire 2017 scanlon et al 2012 generally irrigated crop production is assumed to be impractical once aquifer saturated thickness drops below 9 m 30 ft due to low well yield rawling and rinehart 2018 schloss et al 2002 under status quo management and climate the proportion of the aquifer below this threshold is predicted to grow from 25 to 40 between 2012 and 2100 haacker et al 2016 there are several forces that could affect this timeline to depletion including climate change and producer adaptation historical analysis of land use variations in the u s great plains shows that many land use systems continuously adapt to climate and biophysical changes in response to socioeconomic drivers land use legacies and regional land use traditions drummond et al 2012 it is likely that producers will adapt by shifting crop choice and irrigation practices to slow the rate of decline and extend aquifer life haacker et al 2019 manning et al 2017 schuck et al 2005 through both self organization butler et al 2018 deines et al 2019a and top down restrictions hrozencik et al 2017 climate change in contrast will likely shorten the timeline due to warming temperatures increased crop evaporative losses and increased frequency and duration of prolonged droughts that will increase the need for groundwater resources to support crop production cotterman et al 2018 while the time to depletion is challenging to predict precisely the spatial distribution of regions where depletion will first occur is more certain due to observable variation in saturated thickness and historic depletion trajectories thus it is more a question of when than whether communities will need to develop strategies to sustain their livelihoods without reliance on groundwater for irrigated crop production for these communities an integrated assessment is needed to evaluate potential future land management options and the associated regional economic impacts when modeling future groundwater use and aquifer decline studies often assume that irrigated cropland will transition to dryland crop production e g amosson et al 2009 cotterman et al 2018 dobrowolski and engle 2016 wheeler et al 2008 however irrigation has allowed crops to be grown across a wider range of soil and climate conditions than can support dryland crop production recent evidence suggests that an appreciable proportion of irrigated cropland may transition to pasture rather than dryland crop production due to biophysical limiting factors such as soil quality golden and guerrero 2017 golden and johnson 2013 however the extent to which these factors affect areas projected to be depleted and the associated economic impacts of these limits remains unknown due to a lack of spatially explicit data on the areas in question here we evaluated the degree to which projected economic outcomes associated with transitioning out of irrigated agriculture change when land use suitability is incorporated into the accounting process to quantify the economic impacts of irrigation curtailment we first identified currently irrigated land that would no longer support irrigation through 2100 due to groundwater depletion including the estimated year in which irrigation would become nonviable we then developed a land use suitability model to predict the appropriate non irrigated land use for these areas based on the soil properties of current pasture and rainfed cropland using a case study approach we estimated the potential economic impact of these different land use practices on producer profitability and regional economics for a high priority county in each of six states with appreciable irrigated area sourced from the aquifer in the 21st century reduced well outputs coupled with prolonged drought events have already led to dust storms in the southern high plains region reminiscent of the dust bowl gaskill 2012 our analysis can inform strategic planning to sustain rural communities and avoid a second dust bowl in this ecologically vulnerable region 2 methods 2 1 quantifying annual losses in irrigated land through 2100 we used recently available gridded datasets of groundwater depletion and irrigated areas to estimate future irrigation losses by year at 30 m resolution across the aquifer haacker et al 2016 projected the year of groundwater depletion for the full hpa by linearly extrapolating annual decline rates between 1993 2012 through year 2300 at 250 m resolution haacker et al 2016 defined the year of functional depletion for each grid cell as the year in which the extrapolated saturated thickness fell below a viability threshold of 9 m this represented a minimum saturated thickness required for high capacity wells based on discussion with state agencies and irrigators in kansas hecox et al 2002 schloss et al 2002 these depletion projections indicate the area unable to support irrigation may increase from 25 to 40 between 2012 and 2100 fig 1 a haacker et al 2016 this linear extrapolation approach represents a business as usual scenario and does not account for dynamic management responses to water decline behavior changes induced by increased pumping costs or reduced well yields new technologies that may increase water use efficiency or changes in climate additionally the 9 m saturated thickness threshold may not be a uniform predictor of groundwater irrigation feasibility given heterogeneity in other aquifer properties e g specific yield to check its reasonableness we summarized the distribution of saturated thicknesses in 2016 underlying actively irrigated lands between 2015 2017 see below we found that although the vast majority of irrigated area occurs above this threshold approximately 8 14 and 24 of irrigated area in the northern central and southern high plains respectively occurs below this 9 m threshold fig s1 while the exact date of depletion will likely differ from the haacker et al 2016 predictions our analysis still focuses on the portions of the hpa which are likely to be depleted first given the current saturated thickness and rates of decline and therefore provides an estimate of the potential magnitude of the biophysical and economic impacts of transitions to pasture rather than rainfed cropland we identified currently irrigated land using recently published maps of annual irrigation over the hpa derived from landsat satellite data at 30 m resolution the aim hpa dataset deines et al 2019b this dataset spans 1984 2017 has an accuracy of 91 4 compared to over 17 000 ground truth point locations and shows strong agreement with county statistics from the 5 yr us agricultural census r2 0 86 here we used these maps to generate a new layer of currently active irrigation defined as any area classified as irrigated between 2015 2017 fig 1b we used this 3 year span to capture fields which may have been in a fallow rotation or only partially irrigated in any single year we then used the depletion map to identify irrigated pixels likely to transition out of irrigated production by 2100 due to groundwater depletion and assigned these pixels a curtailment year based on the year in which saturated thickness was projected to drop below 9 m we assumed that all irrigation overlying depletion zones is sourced from groundwater not surface water to test the validity of this assumption we compared the percent of irrigated area projected to be lost by 2100 to the percentage of irrigation which is sourced from groundwater dieter et al 2018 by county we found that all counties have a higher proportion of groundwater irrigation than the proportion of land expected to be depleted by 2100 fig s2 supporting our assumption that transitioned lands were sourced from groundwater the resulting map of projected year of irrigation curtailment is unique in that it explicitly locates the year and location of irrigation curtailment allowing us to assess non irrigated land use alternatives based on location specific soil properties and to estimate economic impacts by year through 2100 2 2 land use suitability analysis to determine whether depleted areas would transition into pasture or dryland agriculture we developed a land use suitability model to predict the appropriate non irrigated land use based on the soil properties of current pasture and dryland crops first we used our map of current 2015 2017 irrigation to isolate non irrigated cropland and pasture from the usda cropland data layer cdl land use maps usda national agricultural statistics service 2018 to do so we used the 2017 cdl cultivated layer boryan et al 2012 which identifies all cultivated land from 2013 to 2017 to comprehensively locate cultivated and non cultivated land areas we then used the 2017 cdl to retain only pasture non cultivated land cover removing forests wetlands water and urban areas any land enrolled in the conservation reserve program in 2015 as identified by a spatial data layer obtained from the usda national resources conservation service through a freedom of information act request was removed to avoid confounding the analysis with land suitable for cropland but currently under conservation status and possibly classified as grassland in the cdl from this resulting map of non irrigated cropland and pasture we randomly generated 40 000 sampling points across the aquifer at each point we extracted the latitude longitude and field slope calculated from a digital elevation model u s geological survey 2017 and non irrigated land capability class and subclass values from the gssurgo soil database soil capability for brevity usda natural resources conservation service 2017 the soil capability scale ranges from 1 best for agriculture to 8 worst for agriculture a soil capability rating of 5 is defined as soils which have little or no hazard of erosion but have other limitations that limit their use mainly to pasture range forestland or wildlife food and cover soil classes are also subdivided into four subclasses based on climate erosion root zone soil limitations and excess water based on preliminary analyses using the 2017 cdl and our irrigation layer 93 of current dryland agriculture in the study area occurs where the soil capability 5 but 31 of pastureland also occurs below this threshold figs s3 and s4 we then randomly split the sampled points into training and validation subsets 50 to each group and trained a random forest classifier to create a binary prediction for dryland crops vs pasture based on these soil classes field slope and spatial location latitude and longitude random forests are ensemble classifiers that generate predictions based on the consensus of multiple decision trees each parameterized with a random subset of variables and training samples we selected this classifier because they are demonstrably fast accurate robust to variable collinearity and overfitting and straightforward to implement belgiu and drăgu 2016 the resulting overall classification accuracy evaluated on the validation data points was 82 with 85 and 78 of test points correctly classified for dryland crops and pasture respectively the full accuracy table is presented in table s1 soil capability class slope and latitude ranked highest among variable importance metrics measuring contributions to classification accuracy fig s5 we then applied this land use suitability model to the full aquifer at 30 m resolution to obtain suitable land uses for areas predicted to transition from irrigated agriculture finally we tallied the total area of transitions from irrigation to each of dryland cropping and pasture classes by county for 157 counties fully covered by the aim hpa irrigation map product which was produced with a 15 km buffer around the aquifer 2 3 county scale economic analysis to demonstrate the importance of accounting for land use suitability when planning for transitions away from irrigated cropland we selected one county from each of six ogallala states with appreciable aquifer fed irrigation for the economic analyses fig 1 table 1 counties within each state were ranked by the percentage of current irrigated area projected to transition to pasture we then selected the county with the highest percent transitioning to pasture with the exception of texas where the 2nd ranked county dallam county was selected due to the availability of economic data therefore our case study examples were developed to demonstrate the largest impacts within each state and provide an upper bound for the error associated with the common assumption that all irrigated land will transition to non irrigated crop production when groundwater supplies are depleted economic and land use suitability models were linked through time to estimate temporal land use changes and corresponding economic impacts in response to changes in groundwater availability two scenarios were evaluated referred to as the simple scenario and the land use suitability scenario the simple scenario assumed that 100 of land transitioning out of irrigation will shift to dryland crop production regardless of land use suitability this assumption is consistent with the dominant approach to date e g amosson et al 2009 cotterman et al 2018 dobrowolski and engle 2016 wheeler et al 2008 the land use suitability scenario uses the land use suitability model described in section 2 2 to partition transitioning areas in to either dryland crop production or dryland pasture production based on underlying soil and physiographic properties thus the differences between the two scenarios represent the economic impact typically overlooked by studies that do not take land use suitability into account and assume all land will transition to dryland crop production by focusing on the difference in scenario outcomes our approach buffers against the effects of our simplifying assumptions regarding groundwater hydrology and change in irrigated crop revenues over time since our results are based on the difference in scenarios both of which use the same underlying assumptions thus this research only considers the economics associated with the land area transitioning to non irrigated production we consider two economic metrics for emerging dryland crop and pasture areas due to aquifer depletion the gross revenue and the community economic impact value added see below in order to generate the economic metrics we assumed that the future proportions of dryland crop types would remain similar to the present day crop mix to quantify this we found the average area for each crop type by county between 2013 2017 based on the areas of annual cdl crop layers not classified as irrigated in the aim hpa irrigation maps table 1 provides the average percentage of major dryland crops by county as well as the percent of total dryland acreage these major crops cover while there are other non irrigated crops grown in these counties the major crops account for between 95 2 and 98 3 of non irrigated cropland we then estimated weighted average gross revenues per hectare based on county specific crop production budgets as an example the kansas state university agricultural experiment station and cooperative extension service annually develops farm management guide crop budgets since there can be large annual variations in commodity prices and input costs we used a 5 year average from 2013 2017 we estimated the gross revenue for pasture based on a previous analysis for finney county kansas asem hiablie et al 2015 in this region pasture is primarily used for cow calf operations which raise animals for later sale to concentrated feeding operations specifically we assume that each cow calf unit requires 15 6 ha that the calf weaning weight is 250 kg and a 7 year average future price of 3 44 per kg these data result in an expected gross revenue for pastureland of 54 29 per hectare the gross revenues for the remaining counties were adjusted based on a ratio of average annual rainfall relative to finney county so that precipitation is used as a proxy for non irrigated pasture productivity for example the gross revenue in dallam county was calculated by multiplying the gross revenue in finney county by the ratio of average annual rainfall in dallam county compared to finney county it was assumed that these gross revenues would be obtained the first year of conversion to evaluate the community economic impacts beyond direct farm revenue of each scenario we used these gross returns as input to a regional economic impact model impact analysis for planning implan implan group llc 2013 we used value added as the metric of regional economic impact bbc research et al 1996 thorvaldson and pritchett 2006 value added is calculated by multiplying dryland crop and pasture revenues by a land use specific regional impact factor table 1 value added consists of four components 1 employment compensation wage salary and benefits paid by employers 2 proprietor income payments received by self employed individuals as income 3 other property income payments to individuals in the form of rent and 4 indirect business taxes all taxes with the exception of income tax we adapted work by golden and guerrero 2017 that estimated multipliers for non irrigated crops in southwest kansas and used implan to generate pasture land multipliers based on the beef cattle ranching and farming sector table 1 finally we compared gross revenues and community economic impacts for the simple scenario and land use suitability scenario for each of the six counties through 2100 3 results and discussion 3 1 land use transitions across the high plains aquifer 3 1 1 irrigation losses based on maps of projected groundwater depletion and current irrigated area we estimated that 22 000 km2 24 of currently irrigated lands in the hpa will be unable to support irrigated agriculture by 2100 fig 1 fig 2 a shows irrigated area losses aggregated to the county level across the aquifer the majority of these losses occur in the central and southern high plains which may lose 9500 and 7500 km2 respectively this is equivalent to 40 of currently irrigated area in the central high plains and 54 for the southern high plains in contrast the northern high plains is projected to lose only 10 of currently irrigated area the more humid north central and eastern portions of the aquifer will likely experience far less depletion induced losses due to higher annual rainfall and natural recharge scanlon et al 2012 although it s worth noting that irrigated area continues to expand in these regions deines et al 2019b and may alter future rates of extraction we also found different patterns of irrigation loss through time among the hpa regions in the southern high plains 80 of losses occur prior to 2060 midway through our study time period in contrast the central high plains sees 53 of losses by this time in the northern high plains where natural recharge is highest 56 of losses occur between 2060 2100 in the latter half of the study period our method implicitly also assumes that irrigated crop producers transition to rainfed agriculture only as a result of the lack of available groundwater however a profit maximizing producer may make the transition when the net profit of rainfed production exceeds the net profit of irrigated crop production as a result this analysis may underestimate the rate of transition particularly as pumping costs increase with water table decline foster et al 2017 our estimates agree fairly well with existing projections of lost irrigated area in parts of the aquifer scanlon et al 2012 estimated that 35 of the southern high plains would lose irrigation within 30 years we estimate a 32 loss for 2042 cotterman et al 2018 project that 60 of area irrigated for corn and 50 of area irrigated for wheat will be lost in the central high plains by 2099 our estimate for all irrigated area in this region is lower 40 although we consider all irrigated crop types which could account for some discrepancy it s likely our use of a higher resolution irrigation layer 30 m compared to the lower 250 m resolution layer they use provides a more refined estimate of current irrigated areas 3 1 2 non irrigated land use suitability we were able to predict suitable dryland land use with 82 accuracy using the random forest model trained on soil capability classes field slope and location table s1 from this land use suitability model we estimated that 87 of lost irrigated area through 2100 could support dryland crop production while the remaining 13 is better suited to pasture use this percentage is relatively consistent across aquifer regions figs 1 2b with 12 860 km2 of lost area suitable for pasture in the southern high plains and 14 in both the central high plains 1400 km2 and northern high plains 680 km2 these areas are also distributed fairly uniformly across depletion timeframes with similar percentages suitable for pasture for areas lost before and after 2060 14 and 13 respectively the land capability classification system that informed this analysis was primarily developed as a response to the dust bowl of the 1930s to prioritize conservation efforts on soils with high erosion potential helms 1992 thus our results suggest that a substantial proportion 13 of lands facing groundwater depletion across the entire aquifer region may again be priority areas for targeted conservation programs to avoid wind erosion events forethought will be particularly important to support the transition highly erodible lands can be stabilized by the establishment of perennial vegetation due to their extensive root systems that can improve soil structure water infiltration and increase soil organic matter levels durán zuazo and rodríguez pleguezuelo 2008 however establishing slower growing perennial pastures can be difficult on erodible lands in the absence of irrigation water porensky et al 2014 these soils tend to have low water holding capacity and erosion events can readily kill vulnerable seedlings hence the quality of the soil will likely dictate the future land use options and these differing options may require proactive transitions to establish perennial vegetation prior to the loss of irrigation 3 2 county case studies 3 2 1 county land use transitions while the land area more suitable for pasture under non irrigated management is evenly distributed through depletion timeframes and within larger hpa regions some counties will be impacted more than others fig 2b here we selected one county from each of six states overlying the hpa to examine land use transitions in detail and estimate the economic impacts of failing to account for land use suitability when planning for irrigation curtailment fig 3 provides the annual changes in depleted irrigated area suitable for dryland cropping and pasture uses for each case study county we estimate that dallam county tx finney county ks and texas county ok will lose 65 57 and 55 of their currently irrigated cropland through 2100 due to groundwater depletion with smaller losses of 30 in dundy county ne and roosevelt county nm and 27 in yuma county co fig 3 in terms of magnitude of area lost dundy and roosevelt counties will lose only 130 150 km2 while texas and finney counties will both lose over 500 km2 and dallam county is projected to lose over 760 km2 based on the land use suitability model the percent of current irrigation projected to become pasture rather than dryland crops for these counties ranged from 6 3 in texas county ok to 19 in dallam county tx fig 2b looking specifically at areas facing groundwater depletion we estimated that at least one third of lost irrigated area through 2100 is more suitable for pasture than crop production systems in dundy county ne 42 66 km2 yuma county co 34 120 km2 and roosevelt county nm 33 46 km2 smaller percentages were more suitable for pasturelands in dallam county tx 28 220 km2 finney county ks 18 110 km2 and texas county ok 11 62 km2 these future anticipated reversions to non irrigated pasture may partially counteract recent cropland expansion which was preferentially concentrated on former grassland and less suitable soils lark et al 2015 3 2 2 the influence of land use suitability on economic impacts we estimated that gross revenues for dryland crop production are 10 8 times greater than for pasture on average across the 6 case study counties illustrating why previous analyses have assumed that transitioned land will be converted to dryland crops rather than pasture the revenue difference for individual counties ranging from 3 7 15 5 this spread arises from the considerable variability in dryland crop revenues among counties ranging from 195 ha in roosevelt county nm to 798 ha in dundy county ne table 1 this is likely due to rainfall and temperature gradients across the aquifer that influence dryland crop mix as well as local economic factors pasture revenues were more consistent across counties table 1 in part due to our assumption of a consistent animal density across counties by comparing the simple scenario and the land use suitability scenario section 2 3 we were able to quantify the economic implications of ignoring soil limits on future land uses in depleted areas we found that ignoring land use suitability considerations in economic models of future agricultural revenues would overestimate cumulative gross revenue from transitioning land by 23 3 across all six counties by 2100 a difference of 1 54 billion for these six counties alone across individual counties overestimations ranged from 12 to 45 table 2 fig 4 these estimates are likely conservative because they predict revenue generation in the first year following a transition to pasture but it can take several years before newly established perennial pastures in a dryland environment can support grazing and achieve peak productivity cook et al 2012 because our estimates of the regional impact factors for dryland crops and pastureland spanned a limited range across our focal counties 0 5 0 64 table 1 the community economic impacts as measured by value added see section 2 3 were similar in range to the gross revenues as a percent difference between scenarios table 3 averaged across the six counties we found a cumulative difference of 23 5 through 2100 between scenarios or an absolute difference of 887 million thus the economic impact of land transitions will ripple through rural economies with implications for sustaining livelihoods beyond the farm due to the large differences in gross revenues and smaller differences in regional impact factors between dryland crop and pasture lands the gross revenue differences will be the primary driver of community economic impacts consequently taking land use suitability into consideration suggests that communities with more land transitioning to pastures will face a more difficult economic transition away from irrigation in all counties annual differences between scenarios increased with time though with different temporal signatures which are reflective of the interplay between irrigation depletion and land use suitability fig 5 for instance in yuma and finney counties the simple and land use suitability scenarios are identical for the next several decades before diverging in the 2030s yuma county and 2050s finney county this indicates that near term depletion driven transitions will primarily be on higher quality soils capable of supporting dryland crops while long term depletion driven transitions will be concentrated on lower quality soils see also fig 3 in contrast the two scenarios diverge almost immediately in dundy and dallam counties fig 5 indicating near term loss of irrigation in lower quality soils in all counties however the difference between the simple scenario and land use suitability scenario grows larger through time reflecting the increasing aggregate area converted to pasture over time combined these results suggest that land use conversions will impact future generations more than the current generation similarly it indicates that the error caused by failing to account for land use suitability particularly soil quality in economic planning models will have significant spatial and temporal variability though errors generally will increase over time it is also worth noting that lost irrigated area is not directly proportional to the economic impact e g fig 4 for example dundy county ne would lose only 15 600 ha of irrigated area but due to the high percentage of land unsuitable for dryland crops 42 and high ratio of crop to pasture revenue where cropland has 15 5x higher gross revenue than pasture these losses lead to 220 million difference in gross revenue between scenarios roosevelt county nm on the other hand would lose a similar 13 600 ha of irrigated area but its lower percentage of pasture suitable land 33 and lower crop pasture revenue 3 7 result in only a 33 million difference between scenarios this emphasizes the variable impact land use suitability can have across space and the importance of local scale modeling to understand the economic implications of aquifer depletion 4 conclusions groundwater depletion threatens the viability of irrigated agriculture across the high plains aquifer particularly in the southern central and western regions local economies need information on the timing scale and plausible replacement land uses in order to plan for diminishing irrigation capabilities here we developed a high resolution map time series projecting annual irrigation losses across the hpa through 2100 and find that 24 of current irrigated acreage may undergo a forced transition to dryland crops or pasture by 2100 due to groundwater depletion by mapping the locations of these losses we were able to estimate likely non irrigated land use for these transitioning irrigated areas based on underlying soil and physiographic properties overall our land use suitability model indicated that 13 of these future depleted areas would be unable to support dryland crop production these limitations are not typically recognized in studies to date instead all irrigated lands are generally assumed to transition to dryland cropping using six county scale case studies we found that soil driven land use suitability limitations which would require conversion to pasture rather than dryland crops can reduce future revenue by an order of magnitude overall failing to account for land use suitability can underestimate economic impacts of aquifer depletion by 12 45 depending on county attributes moreover these economic impacts are not directly proportional to the area of irrigation losses largely reflecting differences in the dryland crop types able to be grown in different settings we made several simplifying assumptions to demonstrate the importance of land use suitability the future is dynamic and unknown changes in irrigation technology dominant crop mixes farmer behavior and climate could all affect our depletion timeframes as well as county economic parameters climate change in particular is likely to impact the study region and alter historical water extraction rates and cropping patterns for example climate change has and will continue to shift the geographic range suitable for different dryland crops cho and mccarl 2017 and is expected to alter crop yields cotterman et al 2018 in addition future climate scenario analyses suggest that some areas may be unable to support even pastureland possibly shifting to even less productive shrublands sohl et al 2019 agricultural systems are coupled human natural systems liu et al 2007 characterized by feedbacks surprises and complex global connections through food supply chains and international trade dalin et al 2017 for example land use can provide positive or negative feedbacks to groundwater levels since studies have found that groundwater recharge drops substantially between irrigated and dryland cropping systems and that grasslands or pasture have lower recharge than either cropping system scanlon et al 2012 riley et al 2019 future work should seek to capture these system dynamics to better understand and manage the full range of impacts from depletion motivated transitions away from irrigated agriculture with this study we used a scenario approach to highlight a key factor that warrants inclusion in future analyses land use transitions have occurred repeatedly throughout human history but often without proactive management to ensure the best possible outcomes for human well being and the environment the development of integrated models that can inform decision support tools and evaluate possible policy mechanisms in collaboration with community stakeholders are critical for managing land use transitions in water limited regions dobrowolski and engle 2016 maczko et al 2016 without forethought and strategic planning a second dust bowl is not outside the realm of possibilities therefore future research integrating soil quality and land use suitability into agricultural hydrological and economic models is essential to understand all aspects of the transition process and help guide the high plains aquifer areas into a sustainable social environmental and economic future declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements we thank erin haacker for consultation on the

10677,the advances achieved during the last 30 years demonstrate the aptitude of the remote sensing based vegetation indices vi for the assessment of crop evapotranspiration etc and irrigation requirements in a simple robust and operative manner the foundation of these methodologies is the well established relationship between the vis and the basal crop coefficient kcb resulting from the ability of vis to measure the radiation absorbed by the vegetation as the main driver of the evapotranspiration process in addition vis have been related with single crop coefficient kc assuming constant rates of soil evaporation the direct relationship between vis and et is conceptually incorrect due to the effect of the atmospheric demand on this relationship the rising number of earth observation satellites potentiates a data increase to feed the vi based methodologies for estimating and mapping either the kc or kcb with improved temporal coverage and spatial resolution the development of operative platforms including satellite constellations like sentinels and drones usable for the assessment of kcb through vis opens new possibilities and challenges this work analyzes some of the questions that remain inconclusive at scientific and operational level including i the diversity of the kcb vi relationships defined for different crops ii the integration of kcb vi relationships in more complex models such as soil water balance and iii the operational application of kcb vi relationships using virtual constellations of space and aerial platforms that allow combining data from two or more sensors keywords crop water requirements earth observation satellites evapotranspiration fao56 approach irrigation management remote sensing 1 introduction a key aspect for efficient irrigation management relies on the timely availability of precise information about crop water requirements which can be represented by the crop evapotranspiration etc a practical and widely accepted approach for estimating etc is the fao56 method where etc is obtained as a product between a reference evapotranspiration eto and a crop coefficient kc allen et al 1998 the eto represents the meteorological evaporative demand and is defined over a reference crop corresponding to a hypothetical crop characterized by a height of 0 12 m a surface resistance of 70 s m 1 and an albedo of 0 23 resembling an extensive surface of green grass of uniform height actively growing and adequately watered allen et al 1998 an alfalfa crop has also been considered as reference crop for evapotranspiration in this case referred as etr presenting a value 1 1 25 times higher than the grass reference of fao56 method asce ewri 2005 the standard method for estimating eto is the fao penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 the other main component in the fao56 method is the kc that represents the physical and physiological differences between a specific crop and the reference crop the kc can follow either a single or dual approach in the first approach the relationship between the etc and the eto is integrated into a single kc whereas in the second approach the crop transpiration and soil evaporation components are considered separately in two individual factors i e the basal crop coefficient kcb and the soil evaporation coefficient ke respectively allen et al 1998 therefore the kc results from the sum of these two coefficients 1 k c k c b k e although no application of remote sensing data is specified in the fao56 method over the past three decades several approaches have been developed towards including this type of data for estimating and obtaining spatially distributed information of kc and kcb and evapotranspiration in support of irrigation management e g

1996 1989 padilla et al 2011 pôças et al 2015 in this paper we present a review of the application of remote sensing data for assessing kc and kcb coefficients specifically focusing on the use of spectral vegetation indices vi the section 2 presents an overview of the kc approach following the fao56 method the potential of using spectral information for the retrieval of vegetation biophysical parameters including kc and kcb is documented in section 3 a review of the methods developed for estimating kc and kcb based on remotely sensed vis hereafter called kc b vi approaches is presented in section 4 advocating their advantages and limitations an overview of the earth observation data and missions most commonly used in the implementation of kc b vi approaches running from satellite missions with long imagery archives until new satellite programs and constellations is presented in section 5 the combined use of soil water balance models and thermal data with kcb vi approaches for kc and etc estimation and mapping as well as the operational applications based on kc b vi approaches are presented in sections 6 7 and 8 respectively the challenges associated to the kc b vi approaches are discussed throughout sections 4 8 the overall conclusions relative to the application of kc b vi approaches to support improved irrigation scheduling is presented in the section 9 2 overview of single and dual kc approaches the kc integrates the crop specific influences on etc by representing the characteristics of a specific crop regarding ground cover canopy properties and aerodynamic resistance allen et al 1998 pereira et al 2015 the characteristics of the crop throughout the growth stages will vary thus affecting the kc values over the crop cycle therefore the kc is function of crop type and varieties phenology plant density nutrient contents climate soil water content status irrigation methods and thus integrates soil biophysical physiological and aerodynamic processes allen et al 1998 anderson et al 2017 er raki et al 2007 glenn et al 2011 katerji and rana 2006 testi et al 2004 there are standard values for kc and kcb tabulated for a large diversity of crops allen et al 1998 doorenbos and pruit 1977 which represent general tendencies in relation to typical lengths of crop growth stages associated to specific climate regions and stand for standard non limiting soil moisture conditions a correction may be necessary for stress conditions to allow the coefficients adjustment for actual conditions therefore a stress coefficient ks representing the effect on plant transpiration can be used for adjustment kc adj allen et al 1998 2 k c a d j k c b k s k e when the single approach is considered the water stress is directly incorporated into kc although with the caveat that this adjustment is more suited when the soil evaporation is null or low 3 k c a d j k c k s although the ks was proposed in fao56 method to represent the soil water stress it is now acceptable to use ks to represent also salinity stress pereira et al 2015 also local adjustments of tabularized kc and kcb are needed to account for differences relative to specific climate regions and inter annual climate variability with consequent impact on the crop growth and development conditions as well as differences relative to crop varieties management practices planting density vegetation height and canopy architecture drerup et al 2017 er raki et al 2007 pereira et al 2015 a key challenge on the local adjustments of kc and kcb relies on adequately representing the timings and lengths of crop growth stages as discussed by bausch 1995 the time running from planting up to the effective cover by the crop and the elapsed time after the effective cover are determinant for adequately establishing the kcb although the effective cover can be related with the leaf area index lai as shown by hinkle et al 1984 and calera belmonte et al 2003 the plant structure and plant development vary between crops and crop varieties therefore it is hard setting a single lai value to be used for determining the effective cover crop transpiration or effective kcb as demonstrated by campos et al 2017 for soybean and maize alternatively several authors have considered the use of growing degrees days gdd to account for the climate variability effects on phenology and crop development and thus set crop coefficients curves as a continuous function hinkle et al 1984 hunsaker et al 2003 kumar et al 2015 saadi et al 2015 the gdd represent an index based on the daily maximum and minimum air temperatures and that considers a temperature threshold below which the crop development ceases hinkle et al 1984 therefore the gdd account for the effects of temperature regimes on phenology and thus are said to improve the precision of the estimates of growth lengths and seasonal evolution subsequently improving crop coefficient curves e g lópez urrea et al 2012 martel et al 2018 remote sensing data in the form of vi i e mathematical combinations of two or more spectral bands of the electromagnetic spectrum birth and mcvey 1968 jordan 1969 have alternatively been considered for reflecting the actual growth stage and status of agricultural crops such application results from the fact that several vis are indicators of the relative abundance of green vegetation and thus radiation absorption e g lai fraction of ground cover by vegetation fc and green biomass jensen 2000 purevdorj et al 1998 trout et al 2008 viña and gitelson 2011 the spectral data used in the computation of vis can result from different types of data acquisition platforms including spaceborne satellite sensors airborne or ground based devices a large set of satellite missions has become available providing a synoptic and repetitive spectral coverage of the earth s surface with improved spatial and temporal resolutions which makes possible the timely monitoring of actual crop growth throughout the crop cycle at field level additionally the technological advances and the cost reduction associated to unmanned aerial systems uas and to handheld devices e g handheld spectroradiometers along with the increase in computational power has created new opportunities for the monitoring of crop growth dynamics gago et al 2015 grounded on the knowledge of remote sensing of vegetation and fostered by the raise of earth observation technologies several vi based approaches have been developed for estimating kcb and kc and further assessing etc e g bausch 1995 calera belmonte et al 2005 campos et al 2010 choudhury et al 1994 gonzález dugo et al 2013 hunsaker et al 2003 2005 mateos et al 2013 neale et al 1996 1989 padilla et al 2011 pôças et al 2015 these kc b vi approaches aim to reflect the actual growth conditions of the crops thus encompassing the temporal variability of the coefficients kcb and kc and provide information of their spatial variability within and between fields and even at broader scales e g irrigation districts however under conditions of crop water stress or soil water deficit the kc b vi approaches represent the effects associated to growth reduction but fail to represent the effect of plants stomata closure on et reduction nevertheless the effects of water stress on the crop can be represented by using ancillary modelling approaches as further discussed in a posterior section the kc b vi approaches have been developed for a large set of agricultural crops including corn barley wheat cotton potato sugar beet garlic alfalfa orchards olive mandarin and peach vineyards and natural ecosystems e g campos et al 2010 er raki et al 2007 glenn et al 2011 gonzález dugo and mateos 2008 hunsaker et al 2003 jayanthi et al 2007 mateos et al 2013 neale et al 1989 pôças et al 2015 other satellite assisted approaches have been developed for estimating etc and crop coefficients including those based on surface energy balance models and remote sensing penman monteith techniques in which the crop biophysical parameters mainly albedo and lai influencing the et fluxes are derived from satellite multispectral data e g allen et al 2007 anderson et al 2012 bastiaanssen et al 1998 sánchez et al 2008 vuolo et al 2015a however these approaches will not be further detailed in the present paper a general representation of the kc b vi methodology is presented in fig 1 and a detailed review of the approaches defined in the last decades and underlying grounds is provided in the following sections 3 spectral information for sensing vegetation properties 3 1 reflectance data for the retrieval of vegetation parameters an increasingly interest in using remotely sensed reflectance data to extract vegetation biophysical parameters has been occurring in the last decades the basics of relating morphological physiological properties of plants to their optical properties date back to studies in the 1960s and 1970s e g gates 1970 myers et al 1970 wooley 1971 and the underlying principle relates with the fact that incident electromagnetic energy interacts with pigments intercellular air spaces and water within plant leaves the energy reflected by the surface of a leaf rλ can be represented as the difference between the incident energy iλ and both the energy absorbed directly by the plant αλ and the amount of energy transmitted through the leaf to other leaves or to the ground τλ jensen 2000 4 r λ i λ α λ τ λ in the optical remote sensing encompassing visible near infrared nir and mid infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum ca 400 2500 nm the component detected is the rλ reflectance and it is its variation that enables the monitoring of vegetation biophysical parameters the relative amount of energy reflected by the leaf varies with the wavelength and region in the electromagnetic spectrum typically the leaf spectral reflectance pattern is characterized by low values in the visible and high values in the nir gates 1970 jensen 2000 fig 2 the leaf pigments in the palisade mesophyll are responsible for a strong absorption of incident energy in the visible spectra with primary absorption bands for chlorophyll occurring at 0 43 0 45 μm and 0 65 0 66 μm thus resulting low reflectance values in this spectral domain contrarily the spongy mesophyll layer of the leaves composed by many cells and intercellular air spaces where the exchanges of oxygen and carbon dioxide associated to photosynthesis and respiration occur is responsible for the nir energy reflected jensen 2000 in the shortwave infrared region liquid water absorption bands occur at 0 97 1 19 1 45 1 94 and 2 7 μm the water absorption bands between 1 3 and 2 7 μm present strong sensitivity to water concentration in single leaves jensen 2000 nevertheless the nir region around 0 95 0 97 μm though with weaker water absorption properties has been shown to be effective in representing canopy moisture content peñuelas et al 1993 1997 although following a similar pattern the leaves of different agricultural crop species exhibit different spectral response patterns fig 2 as a result of each species morphological and physiological characteristics also changes in the spectral response patterns can occur throughout plant growth cycles associated to the impacts of senescence or stress conditions e g due to water or nutrient deficits on the leaves characteristics broadly healthy green vegetation presents high reflectance in the nir region and more nir energy is reflected as the vegetation canopy increases while at the same time more red radiant energy is absorbed for photosynthetic purposes changes in the reflectance patterns in particular increased reflectance at visible and infrared wavelengths may be related with stress conditions as a result of decreased absorption by pigments and water respectively carter 1993 additionally changes in the nir reflectance pattern of healthy vegetation may be associated with leaves yellowing in late plant growth stages i e senescence fig 3 illustrates the changes in the reflectance response of corn leaves relative to increasing water stress conditions expressed through decreasing equivalent water thickness based on data from the leaf optical properties experiment database lopex93 hosgood et al 1993 when considering the vegetation canopy the reflectance response is complex and mainly influenced by i the optical properties of the vegetation elements i e leaves stems fruits ii the arrangement of these elements in the vegetation canopy i e density of leaves and branches leaf angle distribution and vegetation arrangement relative to the angular distribution of the incident radiation and iii the optical properties of the soil underneath the canopy dorigo et al 2007 thus a multitude of interactions of the incident radiation with the vegetation canopy may occur jones and vaughan 2010 nevertheless the optical properties of the vegetation elements are considered the major factors influencing the canopy reflectance and shaping the overall canopy spectral response pattern jacquemoud and baret 1990 following the findings about the leaf vegetation spectral properties direct relationships have been shown between the canopy response in the nir domain and various biomass related variables while indirect relationships were found relative to the canopy response in the visible particularly red domain jensen 2000 subsequently many techniques have been implemented and adopted to extract vegetation biophysical parameters from remote sensing data covering from visible to shortwave infrared spectral regions as detailed in the review by verrelst et al 2015 3 2 spectral vegetation indices the oldest and most studied approach to quantify various vegetation biophysical parameters relies on vis combining a limited number of selected spectral bands the vis are aimed at enhancing the spectral features sensitivity related to a biophysical variable of interest while minimizing confounding effects i external effects such as sun angle viewing angle and the atmospheric composition and ii internal effects related with canopy background variation including topography soil variations and differences in senesced or woody vegetation bannari et al 1995 dorigo et al 2007 jensen 2000 the first reported vis date back to the end of the 1960s and beginning of 1970s and include indices like the simple ratio sr1 birth and mcvey 1968 sr2 jordan 1969 the ratio vegetation index rvi pearson and miller 1972 and the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi rouse et al 1973 5 s r 1 ρ 745 ρ 675 6 s r 2 ρ 800 ρ 675 7 r v i ρ r e d ρ n i r 8 n d v i ρ n i r ρ r e d ρ n i r ρ r e d where ρ745 ρ675 and ρ800 are the reflectance at the 745 nm 675 nm and 800 nm wavelengths respectively and the ρred and ρnir are the reflectance at red and nir spectral domains broadly these pioneering vis were developed to assess canopy properties related with the vegetation structure e g biomass and lai numerous vis were further developed not only to assess canopy structural parameters but also physiological e g light use efficiency stress and biochemical e g pigments content properties nevertheless for the purpose of this paper a main focus will be given to the vis specifically built for relating to vegetation structure parameters various dozens of vis have been developed based on broad spectral bands making use of broadband multispectral satellite sensors data the number of vis further increased with the increasing availability of hyperspectral sensors that collect data in a large number of narrow bands allowing exploring narrow spectral features a review about the vis developed in the last decades can be found in bannari et al 1995 jones and vaughan 2010 roberts et al 2012 and xue and su 2017 the vis most commonly used to assess vegetation structural parameters combine reflectance of the red and nir spectral domains either composed in the form of simple ratios or normalized difference ratios among these the ndvi is one of the most widely known and adopted indices with demonstrated applications in assessing parameters like green biomass lai fc plant growth phenology fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation and also kc and kcb e g baret and guyot 1991 calera et al 2004 campos et al 2010 carlson and ripley 1997 er raki et al 2007 fensholt et al 2004 flynn et al 2008 gitelson 2013 gitelson et al 2002 glenn et al 2011 gonzález dugo and mateos 2008 hunsaker et al 2005 jiang and huete 2010 jiang et al 2006 johnson and trout 2012 li et al 2019 myneni and williams 1994 neale et al 1989 pôças et al 2012 2015 purevdorj et al 1998 rodrigues et al 2011 roujean and breon 1995 trout et al 2008 these applications range from the leaf level up to the canopy ecosystems and global levels despite its wide use studies have found that ndvi presents some instability under varying soil sun view geometry and atmospheric conditions and saturates at high biomass conditions huete et al 2002 1994 huete 1988 nevertheless other vis also combining bands in the nir and red domains were developed to incorporate soil atmosphere adjustments and to improve sensitivity to high biomass conditions e g the soil adjusted vegetation index savi huete 1988 and the enhanced vegetation index evi huete et al 1999 which are widely used as well the savi includes a soil calibration factor l to minimize the soil background influences 9 s a v i ρ n i r ρ r e d 1 l ρ n i r ρ r e d l where the ρred and ρnir are the reflectance at red and nir spectral domains and l is the soil conditioning index varying between 0 and 1 with a value of l close to 1 representing a high degree of vegetation coverage and thus soil background has no effect on the retrieval of vegetation information a value of l equal to 0 5 is considered for the most common environmental conditions and was found to minimize the effects of soil brightness variation and eliminate the need for calibration under different soil conditions huete and liu 1994 the evi is a modified ndvi developed by modis land discipline group that integrates a soil adjustment factor l as well as two coefficients c1 and c2 describing the correction of atmospheric aerosol scattering by using the information of a blue domain band the evi presents improved sensitivity to high biomass vegetation conditions while reducing the impact of the soil background signal and the atmospheric influence huete et al 1999 10 e v i 2 5 ρ n i r ρ r e d ρ n i r c 1 ρ r e d c 2 ρ b l u e l where the ρred ρnir and ρblue are the reflectance at red nir and blue spectral domains respectively while c1 c2 and l are correction parameters set to constant values of 6 7 5 and 1 respectively overall the intrinsic simplicity and easy interpretation constitute the main advantages of vis justifying its widespread use for assessing a large set of vegetation biophysical parameters including kc and kcb moreover the vis allow assessing the vegetation dynamics across time and space as they are indicators of temporal and spatial variations in vegetation structure and biophysical parameters thus facilitating applications related with agricultural monitoring including those related to irrigation management 4 vegetation indices approaches for estimating kcb and kc the onset of kc b vi approaches for estimating crop coefficients relied on the similarities evident between the curves of kc and kcb and vis like ndvi savi and perpendicular vegetation index pvi richardson and wiegand 1977 found in pioneering studies bausch 1993 bausch and neale 1987 heilman et al 1982 neale et al 1989 following these first studies a large set of relationships of vis with either kc or kcb were defined nevertheless the results by choudhury et al 1994 showed a more clearly defined relation between vis and the transpiration component expressed in kcb when compared to the kc the different types of kc b vi approaches include relationships based on canopy growth information derived from vi e g fraction of ground cover by vegetation and more or less empirical linear and non linear relationships between kc or kcb and vis a detailed description of the various approaches is presented in the following sections overall a wide acceptance of the kc b vi approaches for estimating crop coefficients has occurred in the last decades a swot analysis which is a technique used for assessing the strengths weaknesses opportunities and threats was applied for highlighting these four aspects in the kc b vi approaches and is presented in fig 4 4 1 relationships between vis and canopy cover biophysical variables relationships relying on spectrally assessed canopy growth variables have been considered for defining vi based approaches to estimate kcb these methodologies are grounded on the well established analysis of the relationships between vis and both lai and fc and aim to account for variations in effective ground cover associated to each site actual conditions choudhury et al 1994 compiled information of a transpiration coefficient tc and lai for a large set of crops and found that these two variables can be related through an exponential function 11 t c 1 e k l a i where k represents the damping coefficient and its values range between 0 5 and 0 7 choudhury et al 1994 the tc represents the ratio of unstressed transpiration to crop maximum evapotranspiration for full ground cover and thus can be related with kcb gonzález dugo and mateos 2008 12 k c b k c b m a x t c where kcb max represents the basal crop coefficient at effective full ground cover likewise the relationship between vis and lai can also be expressed through an exponential function as shown in various studies baret and guyot 1991 choudhury et al 1994 duchemin et al 2006 13 v i v i m a x v i m a x v i m i n e k l a i where vimax and vimin represent the maximum and minimum values of vi corresponding to dense vegetation and bare soil respectively and k represents the damping coefficient relative to the arrangement of the leaves in the canopy the k values can range between 0 5 and 1 when the considered vi is savi baret and guyot 1991 choudhury et al 1994 while a range of values between 0 8 and 1 4 is reported when ndvi is the adopted vi baret and guyot 1991 noteworthy is the uncertainty associated to this relationship eq 13 due to the saturation effect at high lai values lai 3 4 when the vi considered is the ndvi as shown in several studies e g drerup et al 2017 duchemin et al 2006 neale et al 1989 however recent analyses indicated that the development of plant breeding and management practices have resulted in an increment of lai values at ground level without significant variations of kcb max and the spectral response in terms of savi campos et al 2017 these findings indicate that the lai vi and lai kcb max relationships are not stable even for the same crop and the kcb vi relationship is more consistent combining the eqs 11 13 it is possible obtaining a generalized equation for estimating kcb from vi gonzález dugo and mateos 2008 14 k c b k c b m a x 1 v i m a x v i v i m a x v i m i n η where η is equal to the ratio between k and k this eq 14 expresses the scaling relationship between the kcb and the vi at effective cover vimax and the vi at bare soil vimin following the theoretical frameworks previously defined choudhury et al 1994 neale et al 1989 the eq 14 was used by er raki et al 2010a 2007 for a wheat crop in morocco considering the ndvi as the selected vi and setting kcb max equal to 1 07 and η equal to 0 84 0 54 values of η close to one were obtained by choudhury et al 1994 when selecting savi instead of ndvi resulting in a nearly linear relationship between kcb and savi the relationship between fc and lai can also be expressed through an exponential function as defined by steven et al 1986 for an homogenous canopy 15 f c 1 e g l a i where g is the leaf angle distribution theoretical values of g are equal to 0 5 for randomly distributed leaves less than 0 5 for erectophile leaves and greater than 0 5 for phanophile leaves choudhury et al 1994 the relationship between the transpiration coefficient tc and fc can be approximated by a simple linear function choudhury et al 1994 16 t c f c combining the eqs 13 and 15 results a relationship between vi and fc 17 1 f c ζ v i m a x v i v i m a x v i m i n where ζ is equal to k g in a study with sugar beets and cotton gonzález dugo and mateos 2008 obtained ζ values of 1 8 and 1 when the vi considered was ndvi and savi respectively thus a linear function between savi and fc can be derived as 18 s a v i s a v i m i n s a v i m a x s a v i m i n f c where savimax and savimin represent the maximum and minimum values of savi corresponding to dense vegetation and bare soil respectively therefore by combining eqs 12 16 and 18 it is possible defining a relationship with kcb gonzález dugo and mateos 2008 19 k c b k c b m a x s a v i s a v i m i n s a v i m a x s a v i m i n k c b m a x f c however gonzalez dugo and mateos 2008 introduced a modification in eq 19 to account for two factors i the kcb reaches its maximum before the full ground cover and ii the relationship between kcb and fc is slightly curvilinear depending on crop height 20a k c b k c b m a x f c m a x f c 1 1 0 5 h k c b m a x f c m a x s a v i s a v i m i n s a v i m a x s a v i m i n 1 1 0 5 h i f f c 1 1 0 5 h f c m a x 20b k c b k c b m a x i f f c 1 1 0 5 h f c m a x where fc max is the fc corresponding to the maximum kcb and h is the crop height m the equation can be generalized for considering other vis than savi when assuming an approximately linear relationship between kcb and fc and assuming that a minimum kcb value is equal to zero when fc 0 21 k c b m i n k c b m a x k c b m a x f c m a x v i v i m i n v i m a x v i m i n the kcb vi approach defined in eqs 19 21 was tested for several crops including cotton sugar beet garlic potato winter wheat olive trees mandarin trees peach trees and orange trees e g consoli and vanella 2014 gonzález dugo and mateos 2008 jayanthi et al 2007 jin et al 2017 mateos et al 2013 mokhtari et al 2018 ramírez cuesta et al 2019 another modification to the eq 14 was proposed to account for the occurrence of kcb greater than 0 for bare soil conditions campos et al 2017 the adoption of a residual evaporation factor for bare soil kcb for bare soil has been proposed by several authors aiming to reflect the expectable occurrence of evaporation for a period of several days after irrigation or precipitation events allen and pereira 2009 allen et al 1998 bausch 1993 a value of 0 15 is usually adopted for the kcb for bare soil under typical agricultural conditions when applying the grass reference evapotranspiration allen et al 1998 which can be converted to a value of 0 12 when using an alfalfa reference evapotranspiration wright et al 2000 thus campos et al 2017 introduced a modified approach as 22 k c b k c b m a x 1 v i m a x v i v i m a x v i m i n k k 0 12 k c b m a x 1 this approach was based on the alfalfa reference evapotranspiration and thus a value of 0 12 is considered in the new term introduced in eq 22 this approach was applied to hybrid varieties of maize and soybean campos et al 2017 an alternative approach was proposed by pôças et al 2015 integrating the principles associated to eqs 17 and 19 but further including the information of a density coefficient kd and the minimum of kcb for bare soil kc min as proposed by allen and pereira 2009 the kd was originally defined as allen and pereira 2009 23 k d m i n 1 m l f c e f f f c e f f 1 1 h where fc eff represents the effective fraction of ground covered or shaded by vegetation near solar noon ml is a multiplier on fc eff that describes the effect of canopy density on shading and on maximum relative et per fraction of ground shaded and ranges between 1 5 and 2 0 and h is the mean height of the vegetation this kd coefficient was introduced in the computation of kcb by allen and pereira 2009 aimed at integrating the impact of fraction of ground cover and crop height into the estimation of kc 24 k c b k c m i n k d k c b f u l l k c m i n where kd is the crop density coefficient kcb full is the estimated kcb for peak plant growth conditions having nearly full ground cover or lai 3 and kc min is the minimum kcb for bare soil equal to 0 15 thus the equation proposed by pôças et al 2015 estimates kcb as 25 k c b k c m i n k d v i v i m i n v i m a x v i m i n by including the kd the eq 25 is expected to adapt both for crops with a continuous ground cover and tree crops with bare soil the kd is computed according to the eq 23 where fc eff is calculated following a modification of eq 17 as proposed by pôças et al 2015 26 f c β 1 v i v i m i n v i m a x v i m i n β 2 where β1 is an empirical coefficient depending upon the maximum vi value in each crop stage and β2 is an empirical adjustment coefficient aimed at compensating the decrease in vi due to the senescence and or yellowing of plants which is independent from fc the β1 values are defined according to the crop growth stages ranging between near 0 3 0 4 at the initial crop growth stage and 1 when crop reaches its maximum development whereas the β2 values range between 0 when the crop is in its maximum development and 0 5 close to the harvest the approach described in eqs 25 and 26 was tested for maize barley and olive trees pôças et al 2015 values of kcb max fc max vimax and vimin relative to eqs 20 21 22 25 and 26 are reported in the literature for various crops and are summarized in table 1 potentially these methodologies based on spectrally assessed canopy growth variables have a broad transferability among crop types varieties and crop conditions e g different conditions of planting density in vineyards and orchards 4 2 empirical linear and non linear relationships the conceptual and operative advantages of the kcb vi approaches are not questioned today however the main criticism comes from the variability of the kcb vi relationships depending on the experimental conditions crop type irrigation management and climatic conditions and the linearity of the relationship depending on the vi used besides the conceptual kcb vi relationships specified in section 4 1 a large diversity of more or less empirical linear and non linear kcb vi and kc vi relationships were developed and presented in the literature since the 1980 s table 2 nevertheless as mentioned a more clear relationship between vis and kcb has been proven choudhury et al 1994 table 2 does not have the ambitious to include all the kc b vi relationships published in the literature but instead to provide examples illustrative of the diversity of approaches developed for different crops broadly two main approaches have been considered for the development of these empirical linear and non linear kc b vi relationships one approach considers the development of kcb vi relationships based on the linear transformation of the vis by equating the vi at effective cover vimax and for dry bare soil vimin at the experimental site to the kcb at effective cover kcb max and for dry soil evaporation kcb min respectively a well known example of this approach based on the extreme values of kcb and vi is the pioneering kcb ndvi relationships proposed by bausch and neale 1987 an alternative approach for the development of kcb vi relationships is based on the regression model of the pairs of both variables measured or estimated over the target canopy during the crop cycle an example of this approach is presented by campos et al 2010 for vineyard in both approaches ground data of kc and kcb can be assessed at the experimental sites through the ratio between etc and eto although when focusing on the kcb conditions of water stress absence and minimum soil evaporation in the root zone must be guaranteed the experiences published in the scientific literature following rigorous empirical and conceptual approaches and comparing quantitatively the results of various kcb vi relationships indicate that a relationship obtained based in different crops and areas is valid for assessing etc and irrigation requirements some examples can be found in hornbuckle 2014 analyzing the performance of various kcb ndvi relationships for vineyard odi lara et al 2016 evaluating in apple trees a savi based relationship developed for vineyard campos et al 2013 demonstrating the relative good performance of a soil water balance model applied to natural vegetation dehesa based on a kcb ndvi developed for vineyard sánchez et al 2010 2012 testing in various crops and areas a kcb ndvi initially developed for corn and melton et al 2012 proposing the use of a generalized relationship for real time and operational purposes and applying crop specific relationships a posteriori when information about crop architecture is available the non linearity of the relationship depending on the vi used is considered from the initial developments of the kc b vi approaches as discussed in the previous sub section this is largely justified in the results of modeling approaches baret and guyot 1991 choudhury et al 1994 in addition non linear relationships have been obtained for empirical kcb ndvi pairs derived from etc measurements and simulation of soil evaporation in wheat hunsaker et al 2005 and horticultural crops johnson and trout 2012 table 2 in contrast other experiences analyzing kcb vi pairs derived from selected dates with minimum soil evaporation and stress campos et al 2017 indicate that the relationship can be approached by a linear regression with high precision table 2 4 3 good practices for applying kcb vi relationships the discrepancies between the evidences presented in the sub sections 4 1 and 4 2 prevent us to draw a clear conclusion about the variability and linearity of the kc b vi relationships however the following compilation of good practices aims to establish a common frame for the critic analysis of the kc b vi relationships these good practices are based on the most common sources of uncertainty and the discussion includes alternatives and potential solutions the sources of uncertainty considered are i the actual values of vi and kcb for the extremes of the relationship i e bare soil and maximum vegetation cover ii the actual conditions of the vegetation canopy where when the relationships were developed iii the influence of eto and iv the obvious mathematical uncertainty of the regression approach other sources of uncertainty like the precision of the measurement methods for etc allen et al 2011 and crop reflectance jones and vaughan 2010 are not considered in our analysis thus the proposed good practices for using and analyzing kcb vi relationships include i the approach based on the extreme values of kcb and vi is consistent and operational and can be justified in the absence of ground data for specific canopies however as discussed by bausch and neale 1987 the actual values and the synchronization same physiological stage of the maximum kcb and vi values has to be confirmed and based on field experiences and the assumptions regarding to the minimum values i e kcb min equal or different from 0 in relation to the already mentioned residual evaporation factor for bare soil have to be specified in addition the extreme values of vis are dependent on the soil conditions the configuration of the sensor used and the sensitivity to the corrections applied i e atmospheric correction ii regarding the approach based on the regression of the empirical pairs of vis and kcb throughout the crop cycle the detailed analysis of the actual conditions of the crop monitored is crucial for the development or evaluation of these relationships all datasets of empirical measurements cannot be considered suitable for the development of new relationships in particular the datasets obtained under frequent irrigation or rain with elevated evaporation under probable presence of water stress or under the presence of pests and diseases are not feasible for the description of the kcb curves and hence are not usable for these purposes in the other side these conditions shall be considered when an existing relationship is tested versus experimental measurements iii the state of the art indicates that the kcb vi relationships are not sensible to the water stress when its effect is only noticeable in the transpiration rates and the assessment of these stress conditions is only possible using ancillary modelling approaches based on soil water balances e g campos et al 2013 pôças et al 2015 or based on thermal signal e g alfieri et al 2019 although no strict rules can be proposed about this issue some recommendations based on the experience could help to identify the potential sources of error iv etc measurements on regular conditions are only useful for the assessment of kc curves and the derivation of kcb curves requires additional modeling or assumptions v the kcb curves can be described by smooth continuous functions and sudden increases respond to evaporation peaks after watering events and usually last 3 4 days in semiarid conditions torres and calera 2010 ideally these dates shall be removed from the datasets used for the derivation of relationships or the impact of the soil evaporation assessed with additional modelling vi descending trends of the kcb curve without the corresponding decrease of the canopy density respond to stress conditions the presence of non photosynthetic elements or other aspects related with the maturity of the crop prevent for the use of etc data measured during the crop senescence vii one of the key variables for the development of empirical kcb vi relationships is eto and its potential impact should be considered it is necessary to convert etc values in kc through the ratio etc eto and later on to estimate kcb the uncertainty of daily eto quantified through the errors propagation of the measurements of the various weather variables used in the eto computation varies between 2 9 of the measured values additionally other interferences associated to the weather stations like malfunction of sensors levelling or even location or vegetation presence can increment the uncertainty moratiel et al 2013 the reduction of this error is beyond the objectives of this paper but its impact can be assessed analyzing the uncertainty associated to the use of different eto datasets obtained from nearby weather stations if possible in practical terms it is similar to the consideration of the uncertainty derived from the numerical method used to estimate the numerical relationships the least squares method is only a form of mathematical regression analysis used to determine the line of best fit for a set of data with a range of uncertainty dispersion the systematic report and analysis of this range of uncertainty would help to strength the confidence of the described approaches 5 earth observation for kc b vi retrieval remote sensing technique has long been recognized as a very feasible means to provide spatially distributed information of crop coefficients through kc b vi approaches for several crop systems the use of remote sensing for such application can be grounded on the conventional top view approach optical sensors either from airborne platforms airplanes drones etc or spaceborne platforms earth observation satellites eos the present paper broadly explores the usefulness of satellite imagery for applying kc b vi approaches the minimum suitable satellite data requirements to apply this approach are multispectral observations in the visible vis and near infrared nir spectrum satellite data with medium high spatial resolution has been available since 1970 with the start of the landsat series 30 m vis nir 16 day revisit and after in the 1980s with the satellites pour l observation de la terre spot e g spot 1 2 3 with 20 m in vis nir at the time both landsat and spot imagery were costly and though the spatial resolution of these eos enabled mapping vis of clustered and single fields as well as perceiving the within field variation the associated cost the images availability and the long revisit time were limiting factors in the 1990s there were important developments in sensor technology which significantly improved spatial resolution and data technology with the digital form decisively taking over toward the end of the decade there was a race for space exploitation by commercial companies which led to the first high resolution satellite sensor in 1999 ikonos 4 m in vis nir subsequently numerous multispectral high and very high spatial resolution satellite sensors have emerged e g quickbird 2 4 m in vis nir spot 4 to spot 7 6 20 m in vis nir 1 5 days revisiting worldview2 pleiades rapideye dmc and deimos 1 5 m in vis nir providing land observations with improved capabilities calera et al 2017 however these sensors are not routinely employed for crop monitoring because their imagery are not public domain the imagery archive for specific locations is rather low although programmed acquisitions are possible and come at a significant cost rendering too expensive for most operational agricultural applications and therefore with few application in kc b vi estimation in the 2000s the advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer aster 15 m in the vis nir 16 days revisiting and the moderate resolution imaging spectrometer sensors modis 250 m in the nir vis near daily coverage have arose problems in continuous data acquisition of aster sensor due to communication constraints have limited its use in operational monitoring applications glenn et al 2007 modis although with a very high temporal resolution has too coarse resolution to detect within field variability in kc b vi applications e g mahmoud and gan 2019 however modis data is often combined with ground data maselli et al 2014 or other eos sensors e g landsat to improve the radiometric and temporal resolution of data allowing putative operational use in crop monitoring and kc b vi applications e g gao et al 2015 mokhtari et al 2018 the free and open access policy of the landsat archive implemented in 2008 has fostered a new era of analytical approaches for describing land surface condition and dynamics woodcock et al 2008 additionally the recent launch of esa sentinel 2 also with a free and open access policy has been a great step forward for the continuity of operational systems for kc b vi monitoring and mapping at local regional and global scales the sentinel 2 mission is a constellation with two twin satellites sentinel 2a and sentinel 2b which carries the multi spectral instrument msi able to capture data at 10 m vis and broad nir 20 m red edge narrow nir and swir bands and 60 m atmospheric bands over 13 spectral bands and with a very high temporal resolution of five days at the equator e g transon et al 2018 the improvements in the spatial temporal and spectral e g red edge bands resolutions brought by sentinel 2 represent a major step forward compared to current multispectral missions and provide an excellent opportunity to explore new kc b vi approaches the sentinel 2 mission also provides enhanced continuity of the multispectral imagery by spot satellites series several hyperspectral missions will shortly be launched or are planned such as the italian mission precursore iperspettrale della missione applicativa prisma 30 m spatial resolution the german mission environmental mapping and analysis program enmap 30 m spatial resolution the japanese mission hyperspectral imager suite hisui 30 m spatial resolution and the nasa mission hyperspectral infrared imager hyspiri 60 m spatial resolution while the hyperspectral exploratory sensors enable to extract narrowband vis their applications to improve kc b estimation are still scarce bhojaraja et al 2015 medium spatial resolution long revisit time low signal to noise ratio in particular bottom of atmosphere reflectance of some hyperspectral sensors and the complex data processing are the main limitations compared to sentinel 2 transon et al 2018 nowadays landsat imagery is probably the most frequently used satellite data to generate vis to estimate crop coefficients in both annual and perennial crops campos et al 2010 2017 mateos et al 2013 pôças et al 2015 sawant et al 2016 toureiro et al 2017 vanino et al 2015 however the landsat 16 days revisiting period often extended by the presence of clouds may not be suitable to support irrigation management e g toureiro et al 2017 a temporal resolution of about 7 10 days between satellite overpass is usually considered adequate to monitor the crop growth phases throughout the crop cycle e g vuolo et al 2015b alternative current satellites also fail to simultaneously combine representative high spatial and temporal resolutions largely as a result of prohibitive costs of such systems fisher et al 2017 gao et al 2015 to overcome these difficulties from individual sensors the use of multi sensor remote sensing data and the latest sensor technologies have been considered to create a so called virtual constellation martínez beltrán et al 2009 this multi sensor approach requires a harmonization pre process with several complex steps which involve radiometric and geometric adjustments to make a consistent surface reflectance record for time series applications claverie et al 2018 however in some virtual constellations e g landsat and sentinel it is now possible to access the final high level information in near real time through the usgs http glovis usgs gov and copernicus https cophub copernicus eu sites in addition some companies like amazon s3 https aws amazon com s3 and google earth engine https earthengine google com are offering catalogues of satellite imagery time series from multi sensors at the planetary scale as well as additional cloud computing capabilities calera et al 2017 the most remarkable handicap on these days for the operational use of virtual constellations is the absence of operational procedures for the implementation of atmospheric corrections that ensures the compatibility across time space and sensors the virtual constellation data combining different sensors have been tested to improve kc b vi applications in several crops e g in pastures in australia using landsat 8 and sentinel 2 abuzar et al 2017 and in intensive crops i e sugarbeet potatoes and various vegetables and semi intensive crops such as cereals oilseed and maize in lower austria using landsat 8 and deimos vuolo et al 2015b the use of virtual constellation for both free e g landsat 8 and sentinel 2a and free and commercial e g landsat 8 and deimos sensors currently provides improved spatial and spectral resolution data with a time resolution of around one image per week calera et al 2017 toureiro et al 2017 vuolo et al 2015b in recent years there has been important developments in remote sensing technology and sensors development in terms of mass reduction cost and operability e g pre programed flights which make the use of unmanned aerial vehicles uav or drones viable for agricultural applications these systems present affordable costs to obtain images with very high resolution as well as with simplicity of operation and image processing gago et al 2015 examples of the use of uavs for the application of a kcb vi approach in maize are presented by tang et al 2019 and zhang et al 2019 in an operative scenario programmed data acquisitions with sensors onboard drones and uavs can be combined with satellite data to achieve a high temporal resolution acquisition adequate to monitor the various phases of the crop development throughout the growing season calera et al 2017 nevertheless the combined use of spaceborne and airborne data presents new challenges e g regarding the mentioned data harmonization for kc b vi approaches moreover the use of vis derived from uav has also been tested to assess ks based on a regression between the two variables in combination with a kcb vi approach tang et al 2019 however an independent assessment of the model accuracy and its evaluation over a longer time period is still necessary as acknowledge by those authors overall there is still a considerable gap between data and information for the case of kc b vi approaches the great potential offered by drones uav data is still yet to be fully realised 6 combining kcb vi approaches with soil water balance models swb 6 1 assessing evaporation coefficient ke with swb time series of spectral imagery provide operational kcb maps which can be ingested into the dual coefficient approach expressed in eq 1 and thus providing potential transpiration value maps once eto is known determination of etc to obtain crop water requirements cwr needs the classical approach as fao56 states for estimates of bare soil evaporation as indicated in the swot analysis provided in the fig 4 soil evaporation component has to be considered with ancillary models in the kcb vi approaches soil evaporation is a dominant loss component in many agro ecosystems accounting for up to 35 of total water losses and between 30 and 60 of etc bodner et al 2015 recent research demonstrated the feasibility of soil evaporation soil moisture estimates based on optical and radar signal amazirh et al 2018 however the feasibility of these techniques under partial and full cover conditions shall be evaluated and in our literature review we did not find comprehensive approaches linking the proposed method with kcb vi based estimates for the assessment of etc notwithstanding these techniques can be explored in the future the most common approach widely extended in the literature is the estimation of soil evaporation using relatively simple swb models broadly the two main factors considered for the estimation of soil evaporation are the evaporative atmospheric demand and the soil water availability merlin et al 2016 in practical terms any operational approach should rely on the measurement or estimation of the meteorological conditions evaporative demand soil properties related with the water holding capacity and measurements or estimates of the soil water content in the layer of the soil exposed to evaporation the swb approaches can be based on either simple approaches with low data requirements or more complex models that require detailed descriptions of the processes unavoidable for studies at large scale a well accepted and operational approach is proposed in the fao 56 manual allen et al 1998 as a complement to the dual crop coefficient approach described in the section 1 the methodology relies on the estimation of the evaporation coefficient ke it is based on a single layer swb performed in the root zone including additions relative to the simulation of soil evaporation from the surface layer to compute daily information of ke as 27 k e k r k c m a x k c b f e w k c m a x where kr is a dimensionless soil evaporation reduction coefficient kc max is the maximum value of crop coefficient and few is the fraction of the soil that is both wetted and exposed from which most of the evaporation occurs the eq 27 considers that as the topsoil layer dries less water is available for evaporation and thus a reduction in evaporation occurs in proportion to the amount of water that remains in the surface soil layer allen et al 1998 rosa et al 2016 the parameters necessary for computing ke following eq 27 are detailed in table 3 6 2 combining kcb vi with swb for assessing actual kc the actual kc is calculated as the sum of kcb and ke reduced by any occurrence of water stress conditions eq 2 as previously mentioned complementary methodologies either models simulating the swb at the root zone or thermal based indicators may be necessary to adjust kc b for stress conditions when applying the kc b vi approaches the most commonly used methodology for such purpose consists in the application of a daily swb at the root zone for estimating the water stress factor ks the ks can be expressed as a linear function of the water depletion depth per day at the root zone dr following the procedures defined in fao56 allen et al 1998 28a k s t a w d r 1 ρ t a w f o r d r r a w 28b k s 1 f o r d r r a w where taw is the total available water in the root zone corresponding to the amount of water that a crop can extract from its root zone raw is the readily available water i e the fraction of taw that a crop can extract from the root zone without suffering water stress and ρ is the average fraction of taw that can be depleted from the root zone before moisture stress occurs the taw is computed as a function of the soil water content at field capacity and at wilting point and of the crop rooting depth the parameters necessary for computing ks following equation 28 are detailed in table 3 thus the combined use of kcb vi approaches with swb models allows a spatial representation of the actual kc including under stress free and stress occurrence conditions and subsequently of actual etc various studies report such combined use e g campos et al 2010 2013 gonzález dugo and mateos 2008 mateos et al 2013 odi lara et al 2016 pôças et al 2015 7 integrating kcb vi solutions and thermal based approaches combining kcb vi relationships and thermal based approaches allows overcoming the limitations of temporal representativeness and water stress assessment of the most common remote sensing methods for et the two types of methodologies differ in the nature of the input data the physics of the process analyzed and the models ability to reproduce different processes the thermal based approaches are based on the capability to estimate et even under water stress conditions by using as primary input the surface temperature recorded by the remote sensing methodologies however currently the satellite missions providing coincident optical and thermal data at fine spatial and temporal resolutions are still limited wulder et al 2019 the kcb vi approach solely based on optical data takes advantage of the demonstrated capability of vis to provide a precise estimation of the canopy potential transpiration as discussed in this paper therefore both models are complementary through the estimation of actual and potential et combining both approaches takes advantage of this complementarity in a synergist perspective to gather additional information about the analyzed canopies the existing attempts to integrate thermal based surface energy balance seb approaches mainly focus on the improvement of the weaknesses of the models some previous works considered the combination of seb and remote sensing water balance methodologies using one of the approaches as the central core and the other approach as a support to solve specific problems in this sense singh and irmak 2009 estimated a kc vi relationship based on the kc values obtained by the ratio between actual et values derived from the seb model metric allen et al 2007 and a reference et computed from meteorological data similar combinations of both approaches have been published by santos et al 2012 for olive canopies and by droogers and bastiaanssen 2002 for a river basin scale in a deepest analysis various researches have proposed an inversion procedure of the ks formulation in this sense colaizzi et al 2003 combined the thermal infrared based crop water stress index cwsi jackson et al 1981 and different ks formulations that are based on soil water depletion this procedure allows evaluating the estimated soil water depletion which is estimated by using a swb gonzález dugo et al 2006 also explored the use of remotely sensed canopy temperature combined with swb to assess the variability of plant water stress at field scale kullberg et al 2017 compared various methodologies based on the canopy temperature for estimating the ks which were further evaluated within a swb model using the fao 56 dual crop coefficient approach other approaches based on the inversion of swb formulation have been oriented to correct the soil water depletion and plant water stress estimates barker et al 2018 proposed the assimilation of the et estimated using a seb model to correct the et estimated through a swb model the corrected et values are used to update the estimated soil water depletion and then the ks is recalculated based on the same model campos et al 2015 explored the inversion of the swb for the identification of irrigated fields and the estimation of irrigation doses similar approaches have been proposed by schuurmans et al 2003 for assimilating et values calculated using the seb algorithm sebal bastiaanssen et al 1998 in a spatially distributed hydrological model crow et al 2008 er raki et al 2008 and anderson et al 2007 also proposed assimilating thermal remote sensing based et into a swb model for correcting the discrepancies between both models recently olivera guerra et al 2020 proposed a new approach for the retrieval of irrigation amount and timing at field scale based on remotely sensed optical and thermal data through this approach the ks derived based on land surface temperature data and the fraction of vegetation cover assessed through a vi are further integrated into a water balance model for retrieving irrigation at pixel scale 8 operational initiatives based on kcb vi solutions as presented and discussed in the previous sections canopy reflectance as it is recorded by time series of multispectral imagery can be directly converted through kcb vi relationships into maps of kcb or transpiration coefficient interpolation techniques between close in time images allow producing daily maps of the reflectance based kcb values taking advantage of smooth continuous curves described by the evolving vegetation canopy and so avoiding the effects of cloudiness the interpolation of vis between satellite consecutive measurements to daily values can be done by different functions including linear e g gonzález dugo et al 2013 gonzález dugo and mateos 2008 mateos et al 2013 cubic e g er raki et al 2010b or more complex functions aimed at representing the actual pattern of crop development campos et al 2017 these latter authors defined functions for daily interpolation according to the crops growth phase by comparing the vi values and the corresponding growing degree days during several field campaigns of maize and soybean i an exponential equation was fitted for the initial phase fast development of vi values while ii a compertz sigmoid function was set for the plateau relatively stable vi values and descending vi values decreasing due to senescence periods the product of the daily kcb maps and eto provide directly the daily potential transpiration on a pixel by pixel basis it represents the maximum transpiration value that a determined unstressed vegetation canopy can reach under a determined atmosphere evaporative power the knowledge of this reflectance based transpiration ceiling value is of paramount relevance for operational crop water management allen et al 2011 summarizes the advantages of kcb vi estimation for irrigation assessment as a probably the simplest method to introduce the remote sensing data in the operational application of the penman monteith formulation for et assessment known as the two step methodology which enables quick analyses that can be made by mid level technicians b large areas can be covered and c very high spatial resolution if aerial imagery is used as a result of the recognition of the kcb vi approaches efforts have been made in the last years to connect them with interactive spatial data infrastructures and complementary technologies aimed at easily and timely communicating cwr related data to users 8 1 web gis technologies and mobile apps web mapping applications and geolocation solutions have greatly expanded over the past years in liaison to the rising availability of spatial data and in response to the need to obtain spatially distributed information of biophysical and environmental parameters to support improved resources management including water also the current easy access to digital platforms and technologies makes users more prone to use data communicated through this via in such context the combined use of satellite data web gis tools and mobile apps has been increasingly used in integrated systems for information delivery aimed at supporting irrigation management tasks examples of such systems include the irrisatsms in australia https irrisat cloud appspot com tops sims in california http ec2 54

irrisat in southern italy http www irrisat it eo4water in lower austria http eo4water com and irri eye in southern australia all these systems are based on fao 56 procedures and use the relationship between the canopy reflectance and crop transpiration the irrisatsms system is based on a kcb ndvi relationship hornbuckle 2014 this system developed by csiro was originally applied for vineyards in the murrumbidgee irrigation area but now covers the entire australian continent originally the system was implemented to communicate with the stakeholders through a short messaging service sms interface and was later improved to include a web interface the most recent version of irrisatsms system makes use of google earth engine capabilities for image processing and algorithm implementation the tops satellite irrigation management support tops sims application was implemented within the nasa terrestrial observation and prediction system tops nemani et al 2009 this application provides near real time mapping of crop canopy conditions and associated cwr at the individual fields level through a web based user interface the tops sims integrates satellite data from landsat and modis with eto from meteorological information and ancillary data on crop type and site specific conditions a generalized kcb ndvi relationship is used in tops sims for near real time mapping of kcb and etc but crop specific kcb ndvi relationships can be introduced a posteriori when available melton et al 2012 spider is a web gis based on open source software developed by the university of castilla la mancha this system provides kcb curves based on ndvi time series from sentinel 2a sentinel 2b and landsat 8 images spider is able to display time series of raster and vector maps as well as time trajectories of pixel based values for the periods defined by the user the image processing is off line and a normalization process allows combining multiple image sources as a multi sensor virtual constellation a mobile app version of spider webgis agrisat app was released in 2016 and is available in the most common digital distribution platforms for mobile devices the irrisat eo4water and irri eye use a similar webgis platform developed in an open source software environment with a structure adapted to different areas for considering the specific requirements of the local users vuolo et al 2015a overall the basic information provided by each system includes images of vis color composites relative to the satellite data and core biophysical parameters derived from these images and related with water use like the crop coefficients and cwr all the systems allow user to visualize the images and query the information for different dates or time periods thus providing a spatio temporal analysis additionally all the systems present an option to display the location of the user or device in the maps which can be used to identify areas of interest in the field e g zones with unusual crop development 8 2 remote sensing based decision support systems the remotely sensed kcb vi based systems presented in the previous sub section can feed satellite based irrigation advisory services the information provided to the end user can vary from cumulative transpiration kcb to actual irrigation water requirements iwr based on the information provided by the user for example irrisatsms is able to calculate on the fly a swb for an user drawn polygon and allows to estimate and update the actual iwr and soil water content based on the information provided by the end user other web gis systems like spider also present the capability to display information about iwr and other components of the satellite based swb to the user but in this case the processing is done off line the information provided to the user can be based on different spatial scales i e pixel multiple pixels plots according to the systems comparatively to the traditional irrigation advisory services the satellite based systems have the advantage of reflecting the actual conditions of the canopy over a spatially and temporally distributed frame covering large areas and providing within field heterogeneity information and fostering a more efficient use of water for irrigation by allowing tailored recommendations per individual plot and a timely delivery of information calera et al 2017 calera belmonte et al 2005 vuolo et al 2015a 8 3 forecasting crop water requirements one of the current challenges to the remotely sensed kcb vi based systems relies on forecasting the cwr with sufficient anticipation to allow modifying the irrigation scheduling adapted to the power supply rates water availability irrigation system precipitation probability and farmer s availability one week ahead is considered a reasonable anticipation providing enough time and still ensuring the accuracy of the cwr forecast calera et al 2017 for such purpose the extrapolation of the kc and kcb data and the weather forecasts for eto prediction are required the extrapolation of reflectance based kcb takes advantage of the smooth shape of kcb curves derived from time trajectories of vis making suitable extrapolating using previous dates for short periods as one week the extrapolation of short term eto can be used based on i numeric weather forecasts to determine the variables required to apply fao56 guidelines allen et al 1998 ii daily temperature forecasting by using it as input into hargreaves samani hargreaves and samani 1982 nevertheless for proper functioning the hargreaves samani equation should be restricted to no windy and no coastal humid areas e g nandagiri and kovoor 2006 temesgen et al 2005 and where no forecasting of other meteorological variables than temperature is available

available sources of global reanalysis data that can be used for mapping weekly predicted eto e g hirlam high resolution local area modelling for numerical weather prediction and the european ecwmf

communication tops sims still do not incorporate this product although the system architecture facilitates the forecast of potential consumptive use and associated irrigation demand with lead times of up to one week melton et al 2012 a commercial development of the cwr prediction based on kcb vi relationships has already been developed in spain http www agrisat es 9 concluding remarks the accurate estimation and spatial determination of actual water requirements is paramount for ensuring an efficient use and sustainable management of water as called by the agenda for sustainable development goals united nations 2015 the fao56 method has long been used as a standard procedure for estimating etc through a single or dual kc and an eto the notable advances in remote sensing technologies in the last decades created the opportunity for the effective use of spectral information often in the form of vis in support to agricultural applications including those related with the estimation of kc and kcb as discussed in the previous sections by providing spatially distributed information throughout the crops cycle with an increasingly short revisiting cycle resulting from combining data from various satellite missions and sensors platforms the kc b vi approaches are useful for irrigation management including in a context of precision irrigation nevertheless for better matching the cwr and the irrigation rates the kc b vi products should be used in combination with soil water balance models or thermal based models aimed at obtaining information about actual kc kcb and etc as discussed various studies have shown the good performance of kc b vi approaches through the comparison between etc estimated and measured table 4 following their good performance in estimating cwr through actual etc the methodologies combining kc b vi approaches are now presented as a mature technology and thus are increasingly being recognized as an operational tool for supporting irrigation scheduling also the kc b vi approaches can be used for analyzing etc requirements among irrigation campaigns with positive impact on irrigation planning as discussed in this paper there is a large diversity of kc b vi relationships tested and applied for different crop types climatic and agronomic conditions therefore besides following the good practices enunciated in section 4 3 efforts should be made towards setting the most adequate approaches by comparing the different methodologies under a large set of agro environmental conditions beyond the existing development further lines of research related with kc b vi approaches should be explored in the future for example the integration of kc b vi relationships with thermal based approaches in a synergist manner with the purpose of retrieving additional data from the analyzed canopies different thermal based indicators and approaches should be tested and compared for assessing crop water stress and actual crop coefficients while considering the need for designing accurate data friendly and easy to use approaches that can be applied to feed improved operational initiatives thermal infrared data from currently available satellite missions and systems e g landsat program and iss ecostress ecosystem spaceborne thermal radiometer experiment on space station as well as future systems e g hyperspectral infrared imager hyspiri to be launched in 2022 and sentinel 8 to be launched in 2024 and systems based on manned airborne technology provide a good basis and new opportunities for this research topic additionally

10677,the advances achieved during the last 30 years demonstrate the aptitude of the remote sensing based vegetation indices vi for the assessment of crop evapotranspiration etc and irrigation requirements in a simple robust and operative manner the foundation of these methodologies is the well established relationship between the vis and the basal crop coefficient kcb resulting from the ability of vis to measure the radiation absorbed by the vegetation as the main driver of the evapotranspiration process in addition vis have been related with single crop coefficient kc assuming constant rates of soil evaporation the direct relationship between vis and et is conceptually incorrect due to the effect of the atmospheric demand on this relationship the rising number of earth observation satellites potentiates a data increase to feed the vi based methodologies for estimating and mapping either the kc or kcb with improved temporal coverage and spatial resolution the development of operative platforms including satellite constellations like sentinels and drones usable for the assessment of kcb through vis opens new possibilities and challenges this work analyzes some of the questions that remain inconclusive at scientific and operational level including i the diversity of the kcb vi relationships defined for different crops ii the integration of kcb vi relationships in more complex models such as soil water balance and iii the operational application of kcb vi relationships using virtual constellations of space and aerial platforms that allow combining data from two or more sensors keywords crop water requirements earth observation satellites evapotranspiration fao56 approach irrigation management remote sensing 1 introduction a key aspect for efficient irrigation management relies on the timely availability of precise information about crop water requirements which can be represented by the crop evapotranspiration etc a practical and widely accepted approach for estimating etc is the fao56 method where etc is obtained as a product between a reference evapotranspiration eto and a crop coefficient kc allen et al 1998 the eto represents the meteorological evaporative demand and is defined over a reference crop corresponding to a hypothetical crop characterized by a height of 0 12 m a surface resistance of 70 s m 1 and an albedo of 0 23 resembling an extensive surface of green grass of uniform height actively growing and adequately watered allen et al 1998 an alfalfa crop has also been considered as reference crop for evapotranspiration in this case referred as etr presenting a value 1 1 25 times higher than the grass reference of fao56 method asce ewri 2005 the standard method for estimating eto is the fao penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 the other main component in the fao56 method is the kc that represents the physical and physiological differences between a specific crop and the reference crop the kc can follow either a single or dual approach in the first approach the relationship between the etc and the eto is integrated into a single kc whereas in the second approach the crop transpiration and soil evaporation components are considered separately in two individual factors i e the basal crop coefficient kcb and the soil evaporation coefficient ke respectively allen et al 1998 therefore the kc results from the sum of these two coefficients 1 k c k c b k e although no application of remote sensing data is specified in the fao56 method over the past three decades several approaches have been developed towards including this type of data for estimating and obtaining spatially distributed information of kc and kcb and evapotranspiration in support of irrigation management e g

1996 1989 padilla et al 2011 pôças et al 2015 in this paper we present a review of the application of remote sensing data for assessing kc and kcb coefficients specifically focusing on the use of spectral vegetation indices vi the section 2 presents an overview of the kc approach following the fao56 method the potential of using spectral information for the retrieval of vegetation biophysical parameters including kc and kcb is documented in section 3 a review of the methods developed for estimating kc and kcb based on remotely sensed vis hereafter called kc b vi approaches is presented in section 4 advocating their advantages and limitations an overview of the earth observation data and missions most commonly used in the implementation of kc b vi approaches running from satellite missions with long imagery archives until new satellite programs and constellations is presented in section 5 the combined use of soil water balance models and thermal data with kcb vi approaches for kc and etc estimation and mapping as well as the operational applications based on kc b vi approaches are presented in sections 6 7 and 8 respectively the challenges associated to the kc b vi approaches are discussed throughout sections 4 8 the overall conclusions relative to the application of kc b vi approaches to support improved irrigation scheduling is presented in the section 9 2 overview of single and dual kc approaches the kc integrates the crop specific influences on etc by representing the characteristics of a specific crop regarding ground cover canopy properties and aerodynamic resistance allen et al 1998 pereira et al 2015 the characteristics of the crop throughout the growth stages will vary thus affecting the kc values over the crop cycle therefore the kc is function of crop type and varieties phenology plant density nutrient contents climate soil water content status irrigation methods and thus integrates soil biophysical physiological and aerodynamic processes allen et al 1998 anderson et al 2017 er raki et al 2007 glenn et al 2011 katerji and rana 2006 testi et al 2004 there are standard values for kc and kcb tabulated for a large diversity of crops allen et al 1998 doorenbos and pruit 1977 which represent general tendencies in relation to typical lengths of crop growth stages associated to specific climate regions and stand for standard non limiting soil moisture conditions a correction may be necessary for stress conditions to allow the coefficients adjustment for actual conditions therefore a stress coefficient ks representing the effect on plant transpiration can be used for adjustment kc adj allen et al 1998 2 k c a d j k c b k s k e when the single approach is considered the water stress is directly incorporated into kc although with the caveat that this adjustment is more suited when the soil evaporation is null or low 3 k c a d j k c k s although the ks was proposed in fao56 method to represent the soil water stress it is now acceptable to use ks to represent also salinity stress pereira et al 2015 also local adjustments of tabularized kc and kcb are needed to account for differences relative to specific climate regions and inter annual climate variability with consequent impact on the crop growth and development conditions as well as differences relative to crop varieties management practices planting density vegetation height and canopy architecture drerup et al 2017 er raki et al 2007 pereira et al 2015 a key challenge on the local adjustments of kc and kcb relies on adequately representing the timings and lengths of crop growth stages as discussed by bausch 1995 the time running from planting up to the effective cover by the crop and the elapsed time after the effective cover are determinant for adequately establishing the kcb although the effective cover can be related with the leaf area index lai as shown by hinkle et al 1984 and calera belmonte et al 2003 the plant structure and plant development vary between crops and crop varieties therefore it is hard setting a single lai value to be used for determining the effective cover crop transpiration or effective kcb as demonstrated by campos et al 2017 for soybean and maize alternatively several authors have considered the use of growing degrees days gdd to account for the climate variability effects on phenology and crop development and thus set crop coefficients curves as a continuous function hinkle et al 1984 hunsaker et al 2003 kumar et al 2015 saadi et al 2015 the gdd represent an index based on the daily maximum and minimum air temperatures and that considers a temperature threshold below which the crop development ceases hinkle et al 1984 therefore the gdd account for the effects of temperature regimes on phenology and thus are said to improve the precision of the estimates of growth lengths and seasonal evolution subsequently improving crop coefficient curves e g lópez urrea et al 2012 martel et al 2018 remote sensing data in the form of vi i e mathematical combinations of two or more spectral bands of the electromagnetic spectrum birth and mcvey 1968 jordan 1969 have alternatively been considered for reflecting the actual growth stage and status of agricultural crops such application results from the fact that several vis are indicators of the relative abundance of green vegetation and thus radiation absorption e g lai fraction of ground cover by vegetation fc and green biomass jensen 2000 purevdorj et al 1998 trout et al 2008 viña and gitelson 2011 the spectral data used in the computation of vis can result from different types of data acquisition platforms including spaceborne satellite sensors airborne or ground based devices a large set of satellite missions has become available providing a synoptic and repetitive spectral coverage of the earth s surface with improved spatial and temporal resolutions which makes possible the timely monitoring of actual crop growth throughout the crop cycle at field level additionally the technological advances and the cost reduction associated to unmanned aerial systems uas and to handheld devices e g handheld spectroradiometers along with the increase in computational power has created new opportunities for the monitoring of crop growth dynamics gago et al 2015 grounded on the knowledge of remote sensing of vegetation and fostered by the raise of earth observation technologies several vi based approaches have been developed for estimating kcb and kc and further assessing etc e g bausch 1995 calera belmonte et al 2005 campos et al 2010 choudhury et al 1994 gonzález dugo et al 2013 hunsaker et al 2003 2005 mateos et al 2013 neale et al 1996 1989 padilla et al 2011 pôças et al 2015 these kc b vi approaches aim to reflect the actual growth conditions of the crops thus encompassing the temporal variability of the coefficients kcb and kc and provide information of their spatial variability within and between fields and even at broader scales e g irrigation districts however under conditions of crop water stress or soil water deficit the kc b vi approaches represent the effects associated to growth reduction but fail to represent the effect of plants stomata closure on et reduction nevertheless the effects of water stress on the crop can be represented by using ancillary modelling approaches as further discussed in a posterior section the kc b vi approaches have been developed for a large set of agricultural crops including corn barley wheat cotton potato sugar beet garlic alfalfa orchards olive mandarin and peach vineyards and natural ecosystems e g campos et al 2010 er raki et al 2007 glenn et al 2011 gonzález dugo and mateos 2008 hunsaker et al 2003 jayanthi et al 2007 mateos et al 2013 neale et al 1989 pôças et al 2015 other satellite assisted approaches have been developed for estimating etc and crop coefficients including those based on surface energy balance models and remote sensing penman monteith techniques in which the crop biophysical parameters mainly albedo and lai influencing the et fluxes are derived from satellite multispectral data e g allen et al 2007 anderson et al 2012 bastiaanssen et al 1998 sánchez et al 2008 vuolo et al 2015a however these approaches will not be further detailed in the present paper a general representation of the kc b vi methodology is presented in fig 1 and a detailed review of the approaches defined in the last decades and underlying grounds is provided in the following sections 3 spectral information for sensing vegetation properties 3 1 reflectance data for the retrieval of vegetation parameters an increasingly interest in using remotely sensed reflectance data to extract vegetation biophysical parameters has been occurring in the last decades the basics of relating morphological physiological properties of plants to their optical properties date back to studies in the 1960s and 1970s e g gates 1970 myers et al 1970 wooley 1971 and the underlying principle relates with the fact that incident electromagnetic energy interacts with pigments intercellular air spaces and water within plant leaves the energy reflected by the surface of a leaf rλ can be represented as the difference between the incident energy iλ and both the energy absorbed directly by the plant αλ and the amount of energy transmitted through the leaf to other leaves or to the ground τλ jensen 2000 4 r λ i λ α λ τ λ in the optical remote sensing encompassing visible near infrared nir and mid infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum ca 400 2500 nm the component detected is the rλ reflectance and it is its variation that enables the monitoring of vegetation biophysical parameters the relative amount of energy reflected by the leaf varies with the wavelength and region in the electromagnetic spectrum typically the leaf spectral reflectance pattern is characterized by low values in the visible and high values in the nir gates 1970 jensen 2000 fig 2 the leaf pigments in the palisade mesophyll are responsible for a strong absorption of incident energy in the visible spectra with primary absorption bands for chlorophyll occurring at 0 43 0 45 μm and 0 65 0 66 μm thus resulting low reflectance values in this spectral domain contrarily the spongy mesophyll layer of the leaves composed by many cells and intercellular air spaces where the exchanges of oxygen and carbon dioxide associated to photosynthesis and respiration occur is responsible for the nir energy reflected jensen 2000 in the shortwave infrared region liquid water absorption bands occur at 0 97 1 19 1 45 1 94 and 2 7 μm the water absorption bands between 1 3 and 2 7 μm present strong sensitivity to water concentration in single leaves jensen 2000 nevertheless the nir region around 0 95 0 97 μm though with weaker water absorption properties has been shown to be effective in representing canopy moisture content peñuelas et al 1993 1997 although following a similar pattern the leaves of different agricultural crop species exhibit different spectral response patterns fig 2 as a result of each species morphological and physiological characteristics also changes in the spectral response patterns can occur throughout plant growth cycles associated to the impacts of senescence or stress conditions e g due to water or nutrient deficits on the leaves characteristics broadly healthy green vegetation presents high reflectance in the nir region and more nir energy is reflected as the vegetation canopy increases while at the same time more red radiant energy is absorbed for photosynthetic purposes changes in the reflectance patterns in particular increased reflectance at visible and infrared wavelengths may be related with stress conditions as a result of decreased absorption by pigments and water respectively carter 1993 additionally changes in the nir reflectance pattern of healthy vegetation may be associated with leaves yellowing in late plant growth stages i e senescence fig 3 illustrates the changes in the reflectance response of corn leaves relative to increasing water stress conditions expressed through decreasing equivalent water thickness based on data from the leaf optical properties experiment database lopex93 hosgood et al 1993 when considering the vegetation canopy the reflectance response is complex and mainly influenced by i the optical properties of the vegetation elements i e leaves stems fruits ii the arrangement of these elements in the vegetation canopy i e density of leaves and branches leaf angle distribution and vegetation arrangement relative to the angular distribution of the incident radiation and iii the optical properties of the soil underneath the canopy dorigo et al 2007 thus a multitude of interactions of the incident radiation with the vegetation canopy may occur jones and vaughan 2010 nevertheless the optical properties of the vegetation elements are considered the major factors influencing the canopy reflectance and shaping the overall canopy spectral response pattern jacquemoud and baret 1990 following the findings about the leaf vegetation spectral properties direct relationships have been shown between the canopy response in the nir domain and various biomass related variables while indirect relationships were found relative to the canopy response in the visible particularly red domain jensen 2000 subsequently many techniques have been implemented and adopted to extract vegetation biophysical parameters from remote sensing data covering from visible to shortwave infrared spectral regions as detailed in the review by verrelst et al 2015 3 2 spectral vegetation indices the oldest and most studied approach to quantify various vegetation biophysical parameters relies on vis combining a limited number of selected spectral bands the vis are aimed at enhancing the spectral features sensitivity related to a biophysical variable of interest while minimizing confounding effects i external effects such as sun angle viewing angle and the atmospheric composition and ii internal effects related with canopy background variation including topography soil variations and differences in senesced or woody vegetation bannari et al 1995 dorigo et al 2007 jensen 2000 the first reported vis date back to the end of the 1960s and beginning of 1970s and include indices like the simple ratio sr1 birth and mcvey 1968 sr2 jordan 1969 the ratio vegetation index rvi pearson and miller 1972 and the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi rouse et al 1973 5 s r 1 ρ 745 ρ 675 6 s r 2 ρ 800 ρ 675 7 r v i ρ r e d ρ n i r 8 n d v i ρ n i r ρ r e d ρ n i r ρ r e d where ρ745 ρ675 and ρ800 are the reflectance at the 745 nm 675 nm and 800 nm wavelengths respectively and the ρred and ρnir are the reflectance at red and nir spectral domains broadly these pioneering vis were developed to assess canopy properties related with the vegetation structure e g biomass and lai numerous vis were further developed not only to assess canopy structural parameters but also physiological e g light use efficiency stress and biochemical e g pigments content properties nevertheless for the purpose of this paper a main focus will be given to the vis specifically built for relating to vegetation structure parameters various dozens of vis have been developed based on broad spectral bands making use of broadband multispectral satellite sensors data the number of vis further increased with the increasing availability of hyperspectral sensors that collect data in a large number of narrow bands allowing exploring narrow spectral features a review about the vis developed in the last decades can be found in bannari et al 1995 jones and vaughan 2010 roberts et al 2012 and xue and su 2017 the vis most commonly used to assess vegetation structural parameters combine reflectance of the red and nir spectral domains either composed in the form of simple ratios or normalized difference ratios among these the ndvi is one of the most widely known and adopted indices with demonstrated applications in assessing parameters like green biomass lai fc plant growth phenology fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation and also kc and kcb e g baret and guyot 1991 calera et al 2004 campos et al 2010 carlson and ripley 1997 er raki et al 2007 fensholt et al 2004 flynn et al 2008 gitelson 2013 gitelson et al 2002 glenn et al 2011 gonzález dugo and mateos 2008 hunsaker et al 2005 jiang and huete 2010 jiang et al 2006 johnson and trout 2012 li et al 2019 myneni and williams 1994 neale et al 1989 pôças et al 2012 2015 purevdorj et al 1998 rodrigues et al 2011 roujean and breon 1995 trout et al 2008 these applications range from the leaf level up to the canopy ecosystems and global levels despite its wide use studies have found that ndvi presents some instability under varying soil sun view geometry and atmospheric conditions and saturates at high biomass conditions huete et al 2002 1994 huete 1988 nevertheless other vis also combining bands in the nir and red domains were developed to incorporate soil atmosphere adjustments and to improve sensitivity to high biomass conditions e g the soil adjusted vegetation index savi huete 1988 and the enhanced vegetation index evi huete et al 1999 which are widely used as well the savi includes a soil calibration factor l to minimize the soil background influences 9 s a v i ρ n i r ρ r e d 1 l ρ n i r ρ r e d l where the ρred and ρnir are the reflectance at red and nir spectral domains and l is the soil conditioning index varying between 0 and 1 with a value of l close to 1 representing a high degree of vegetation coverage and thus soil background has no effect on the retrieval of vegetation information a value of l equal to 0 5 is considered for the most common environmental conditions and was found to minimize the effects of soil brightness variation and eliminate the need for calibration under different soil conditions huete and liu 1994 the evi is a modified ndvi developed by modis land discipline group that integrates a soil adjustment factor l as well as two coefficients c1 and c2 describing the correction of atmospheric aerosol scattering by using the information of a blue domain band the evi presents improved sensitivity to high biomass vegetation conditions while reducing the impact of the soil background signal and the atmospheric influence huete et al 1999 10 e v i 2 5 ρ n i r ρ r e d ρ n i r c 1 ρ r e d c 2 ρ b l u e l where the ρred ρnir and ρblue are the reflectance at red nir and blue spectral domains respectively while c1 c2 and l are correction parameters set to constant values of 6 7 5 and 1 respectively overall the intrinsic simplicity and easy interpretation constitute the main advantages of vis justifying its widespread use for assessing a large set of vegetation biophysical parameters including kc and kcb moreover the vis allow assessing the vegetation dynamics across time and space as they are indicators of temporal and spatial variations in vegetation structure and biophysical parameters thus facilitating applications related with agricultural monitoring including those related to irrigation management 4 vegetation indices approaches for estimating kcb and kc the onset of kc b vi approaches for estimating crop coefficients relied on the similarities evident between the curves of kc and kcb and vis like ndvi savi and perpendicular vegetation index pvi richardson and wiegand 1977 found in pioneering studies bausch 1993 bausch and neale 1987 heilman et al 1982 neale et al 1989 following these first studies a large set of relationships of vis with either kc or kcb were defined nevertheless the results by choudhury et al 1994 showed a more clearly defined relation between vis and the transpiration component expressed in kcb when compared to the kc the different types of kc b vi approaches include relationships based on canopy growth information derived from vi e g fraction of ground cover by vegetation and more or less empirical linear and non linear relationships between kc or kcb and vis a detailed description of the various approaches is presented in the following sections overall a wide acceptance of the kc b vi approaches for estimating crop coefficients has occurred in the last decades a swot analysis which is a technique used for assessing the strengths weaknesses opportunities and threats was applied for highlighting these four aspects in the kc b vi approaches and is presented in fig 4 4 1 relationships between vis and canopy cover biophysical variables relationships relying on spectrally assessed canopy growth variables have been considered for defining vi based approaches to estimate kcb these methodologies are grounded on the well established analysis of the relationships between vis and both lai and fc and aim to account for variations in effective ground cover associated to each site actual conditions choudhury et al 1994 compiled information of a transpiration coefficient tc and lai for a large set of crops and found that these two variables can be related through an exponential function 11 t c 1 e k l a i where k represents the damping coefficient and its values range between 0 5 and 0 7 choudhury et al 1994 the tc represents the ratio of unstressed transpiration to crop maximum evapotranspiration for full ground cover and thus can be related with kcb gonzález dugo and mateos 2008 12 k c b k c b m a x t c where kcb max represents the basal crop coefficient at effective full ground cover likewise the relationship between vis and lai can also be expressed through an exponential function as shown in various studies baret and guyot 1991 choudhury et al 1994 duchemin et al 2006 13 v i v i m a x v i m a x v i m i n e k l a i where vimax and vimin represent the maximum and minimum values of vi corresponding to dense vegetation and bare soil respectively and k represents the damping coefficient relative to the arrangement of the leaves in the canopy the k values can range between 0 5 and 1 when the considered vi is savi baret and guyot 1991 choudhury et al 1994 while a range of values between 0 8 and 1 4 is reported when ndvi is the adopted vi baret and guyot 1991 noteworthy is the uncertainty associated to this relationship eq 13 due to the saturation effect at high lai values lai 3 4 when the vi considered is the ndvi as shown in several studies e g drerup et al 2017 duchemin et al 2006 neale et al 1989 however recent analyses indicated that the development of plant breeding and management practices have resulted in an increment of lai values at ground level without significant variations of kcb max and the spectral response in terms of savi campos et al 2017 these findings indicate that the lai vi and lai kcb max relationships are not stable even for the same crop and the kcb vi relationship is more consistent combining the eqs 11 13 it is possible obtaining a generalized equation for estimating kcb from vi gonzález dugo and mateos 2008 14 k c b k c b m a x 1 v i m a x v i v i m a x v i m i n η where η is equal to the ratio between k and k this eq 14 expresses the scaling relationship between the kcb and the vi at effective cover vimax and the vi at bare soil vimin following the theoretical frameworks previously defined choudhury et al 1994 neale et al 1989 the eq 14 was used by er raki et al 2010a 2007 for a wheat crop in morocco considering the ndvi as the selected vi and setting kcb max equal to 1 07 and η equal to 0 84 0 54 values of η close to one were obtained by choudhury et al 1994 when selecting savi instead of ndvi resulting in a nearly linear relationship between kcb and savi the relationship between fc and lai can also be expressed through an exponential function as defined by steven et al 1986 for an homogenous canopy 15 f c 1 e g l a i where g is the leaf angle distribution theoretical values of g are equal to 0 5 for randomly distributed leaves less than 0 5 for erectophile leaves and greater than 0 5 for phanophile leaves choudhury et al 1994 the relationship between the transpiration coefficient tc and fc can be approximated by a simple linear function choudhury et al 1994 16 t c f c combining the eqs 13 and 15 results a relationship between vi and fc 17 1 f c ζ v i m a x v i v i m a x v i m i n where ζ is equal to k g in a study with sugar beets and cotton gonzález dugo and mateos 2008 obtained ζ values of 1 8 and 1 when the vi considered was ndvi and savi respectively thus a linear function between savi and fc can be derived as 18 s a v i s a v i m i n s a v i m a x s a v i m i n f c where savimax and savimin represent the maximum and minimum values of savi corresponding to dense vegetation and bare soil respectively therefore by combining eqs 12 16 and 18 it is possible defining a relationship with kcb gonzález dugo and mateos 2008 19 k c b k c b m a x s a v i s a v i m i n s a v i m a x s a v i m i n k c b m a x f c however gonzalez dugo and mateos 2008 introduced a modification in eq 19 to account for two factors i the kcb reaches its maximum before the full ground cover and ii the relationship between kcb and fc is slightly curvilinear depending on crop height 20a k c b k c b m a x f c m a x f c 1 1 0 5 h k c b m a x f c m a x s a v i s a v i m i n s a v i m a x s a v i m i n 1 1 0 5 h i f f c 1 1 0 5 h f c m a x 20b k c b k c b m a x i f f c 1 1 0 5 h f c m a x where fc max is the fc corresponding to the maximum kcb and h is the crop height m the equation can be generalized for considering other vis than savi when assuming an approximately linear relationship between kcb and fc and assuming that a minimum kcb value is equal to zero when fc 0 21 k c b m i n k c b m a x k c b m a x f c m a x v i v i m i n v i m a x v i m i n the kcb vi approach defined in eqs 19 21 was tested for several crops including cotton sugar beet garlic potato winter wheat olive trees mandarin trees peach trees and orange trees e g consoli and vanella 2014 gonzález dugo and mateos 2008 jayanthi et al 2007 jin et al 2017 mateos et al 2013 mokhtari et al 2018 ramírez cuesta et al 2019 another modification to the eq 14 was proposed to account for the occurrence of kcb greater than 0 for bare soil conditions campos et al 2017 the adoption of a residual evaporation factor for bare soil kcb for bare soil has been proposed by several authors aiming to reflect the expectable occurrence of evaporation for a period of several days after irrigation or precipitation events allen and pereira 2009 allen et al 1998 bausch 1993 a value of 0 15 is usually adopted for the kcb for bare soil under typical agricultural conditions when applying the grass reference evapotranspiration allen et al 1998 which can be converted to a value of 0 12 when using an alfalfa reference evapotranspiration wright et al 2000 thus campos et al 2017 introduced a modified approach as 22 k c b k c b m a x 1 v i m a x v i v i m a x v i m i n k k 0 12 k c b m a x 1 this approach was based on the alfalfa reference evapotranspiration and thus a value of 0 12 is considered in the new term introduced in eq 22 this approach was applied to hybrid varieties of maize and soybean campos et al 2017 an alternative approach was proposed by pôças et al 2015 integrating the principles associated to eqs 17 and 19 but further including the information of a density coefficient kd and the minimum of kcb for bare soil kc min as proposed by allen and pereira 2009 the kd was originally defined as allen and pereira 2009 23 k d m i n 1 m l f c e f f f c e f f 1 1 h where fc eff represents the effective fraction of ground covered or shaded by vegetation near solar noon ml is a multiplier on fc eff that describes the effect of canopy density on shading and on maximum relative et per fraction of ground shaded and ranges between 1 5 and 2 0 and h is the mean height of the vegetation this kd coefficient was introduced in the computation of kcb by allen and pereira 2009 aimed at integrating the impact of fraction of ground cover and crop height into the estimation of kc 24 k c b k c m i n k d k c b f u l l k c m i n where kd is the crop density coefficient kcb full is the estimated kcb for peak plant growth conditions having nearly full ground cover or lai 3 and kc min is the minimum kcb for bare soil equal to 0 15 thus the equation proposed by pôças et al 2015 estimates kcb as 25 k c b k c m i n k d v i v i m i n v i m a x v i m i n by including the kd the eq 25 is expected to adapt both for crops with a continuous ground cover and tree crops with bare soil the kd is computed according to the eq 23 where fc eff is calculated following a modification of eq 17 as proposed by pôças et al 2015 26 f c β 1 v i v i m i n v i m a x v i m i n β 2 where β1 is an empirical coefficient depending upon the maximum vi value in each crop stage and β2 is an empirical adjustment coefficient aimed at compensating the decrease in vi due to the senescence and or yellowing of plants which is independent from fc the β1 values are defined according to the crop growth stages ranging between near 0 3 0 4 at the initial crop growth stage and 1 when crop reaches its maximum development whereas the β2 values range between 0 when the crop is in its maximum development and 0 5 close to the harvest the approach described in eqs 25 and 26 was tested for maize barley and olive trees pôças et al 2015 values of kcb max fc max vimax and vimin relative to eqs 20 21 22 25 and 26 are reported in the literature for various crops and are summarized in table 1 potentially these methodologies based on spectrally assessed canopy growth variables have a broad transferability among crop types varieties and crop conditions e g different conditions of planting density in vineyards and orchards 4 2 empirical linear and non linear relationships the conceptual and operative advantages of the kcb vi approaches are not questioned today however the main criticism comes from the variability of the kcb vi relationships depending on the experimental conditions crop type irrigation management and climatic conditions and the linearity of the relationship depending on the vi used besides the conceptual kcb vi relationships specified in section 4 1 a large diversity of more or less empirical linear and non linear kcb vi and kc vi relationships were developed and presented in the literature since the 1980 s table 2 nevertheless as mentioned a more clear relationship between vis and kcb has been proven choudhury et al 1994 table 2 does not have the ambitious to include all the kc b vi relationships published in the literature but instead to provide examples illustrative of the diversity of approaches developed for different crops broadly two main approaches have been considered for the development of these empirical linear and non linear kc b vi relationships one approach considers the development of kcb vi relationships based on the linear transformation of the vis by equating the vi at effective cover vimax and for dry bare soil vimin at the experimental site to the kcb at effective cover kcb max and for dry soil evaporation kcb min respectively a well known example of this approach based on the extreme values of kcb and vi is the pioneering kcb ndvi relationships proposed by bausch and neale 1987 an alternative approach for the development of kcb vi relationships is based on the regression model of the pairs of both variables measured or estimated over the target canopy during the crop cycle an example of this approach is presented by campos et al 2010 for vineyard in both approaches ground data of kc and kcb can be assessed at the experimental sites through the ratio between etc and eto although when focusing on the kcb conditions of water stress absence and minimum soil evaporation in the root zone must be guaranteed the experiences published in the scientific literature following rigorous empirical and conceptual approaches and comparing quantitatively the results of various kcb vi relationships indicate that a relationship obtained based in different crops and areas is valid for assessing etc and irrigation requirements some examples can be found in hornbuckle 2014 analyzing the performance of various kcb ndvi relationships for vineyard odi lara et al 2016 evaluating in apple trees a savi based relationship developed for vineyard campos et al 2013 demonstrating the relative good performance of a soil water balance model applied to natural vegetation dehesa based on a kcb ndvi developed for vineyard sánchez et al 2010 2012 testing in various crops and areas a kcb ndvi initially developed for corn and melton et al 2012 proposing the use of a generalized relationship for real time and operational purposes and applying crop specific relationships a posteriori when information about crop architecture is available the non linearity of the relationship depending on the vi used is considered from the initial developments of the kc b vi approaches as discussed in the previous sub section this is largely justified in the results of modeling approaches baret and guyot 1991 choudhury et al 1994 in addition non linear relationships have been obtained for empirical kcb ndvi pairs derived from etc measurements and simulation of soil evaporation in wheat hunsaker et al 2005 and horticultural crops johnson and trout 2012 table 2 in contrast other experiences analyzing kcb vi pairs derived from selected dates with minimum soil evaporation and stress campos et al 2017 indicate that the relationship can be approached by a linear regression with high precision table 2 4 3 good practices for applying kcb vi relationships the discrepancies between the evidences presented in the sub sections 4 1 and 4 2 prevent us to draw a clear conclusion about the variability and linearity of the kc b vi relationships however the following compilation of good practices aims to establish a common frame for the critic analysis of the kc b vi relationships these good practices are based on the most common sources of uncertainty and the discussion includes alternatives and potential solutions the sources of uncertainty considered are i the actual values of vi and kcb for the extremes of the relationship i e bare soil and maximum vegetation cover ii the actual conditions of the vegetation canopy where when the relationships were developed iii the influence of eto and iv the obvious mathematical uncertainty of the regression approach other sources of uncertainty like the precision of the measurement methods for etc allen et al 2011 and crop reflectance jones and vaughan 2010 are not considered in our analysis thus the proposed good practices for using and analyzing kcb vi relationships include i the approach based on the extreme values of kcb and vi is consistent and operational and can be justified in the absence of ground data for specific canopies however as discussed by bausch and neale 1987 the actual values and the synchronization same physiological stage of the maximum kcb and vi values has to be confirmed and based on field experiences and the assumptions regarding to the minimum values i e kcb min equal or different from 0 in relation to the already mentioned residual evaporation factor for bare soil have to be specified in addition the extreme values of vis are dependent on the soil conditions the configuration of the sensor used and the sensitivity to the corrections applied i e atmospheric correction ii regarding the approach based on the regression of the empirical pairs of vis and kcb throughout the crop cycle the detailed analysis of the actual conditions of the crop monitored is crucial for the development or evaluation of these relationships all datasets of empirical measurements cannot be considered suitable for the development of new relationships in particular the datasets obtained under frequent irrigation or rain with elevated evaporation under probable presence of water stress or under the presence of pests and diseases are not feasible for the description of the kcb curves and hence are not usable for these purposes in the other side these conditions shall be considered when an existing relationship is tested versus experimental measurements iii the state of the art indicates that the kcb vi relationships are not sensible to the water stress when its effect is only noticeable in the transpiration rates and the assessment of these stress conditions is only possible using ancillary modelling approaches based on soil water balances e g campos et al 2013 pôças et al 2015 or based on thermal signal e g alfieri et al 2019 although no strict rules can be proposed about this issue some recommendations based on the experience could help to identify the potential sources of error iv etc measurements on regular conditions are only useful for the assessment of kc curves and the derivation of kcb curves requires additional modeling or assumptions v the kcb curves can be described by smooth continuous functions and sudden increases respond to evaporation peaks after watering events and usually last 3 4 days in semiarid conditions torres and calera 2010 ideally these dates shall be removed from the datasets used for the derivation of relationships or the impact of the soil evaporation assessed with additional modelling vi descending trends of the kcb curve without the corresponding decrease of the canopy density respond to stress conditions the presence of non photosynthetic elements or other aspects related with the maturity of the crop prevent for the use of etc data measured during the crop senescence vii one of the key variables for the development of empirical kcb vi relationships is eto and its potential impact should be considered it is necessary to convert etc values in kc through the ratio etc eto and later on to estimate kcb the uncertainty of daily eto quantified through the errors propagation of the measurements of the various weather variables used in the eto computation varies between 2 9 of the measured values additionally other interferences associated to the weather stations like malfunction of sensors levelling or even location or vegetation presence can increment the uncertainty moratiel et al 2013 the reduction of this error is beyond the objectives of this paper but its impact can be assessed analyzing the uncertainty associated to the use of different eto datasets obtained from nearby weather stations if possible in practical terms it is similar to the consideration of the uncertainty derived from the numerical method used to estimate the numerical relationships the least squares method is only a form of mathematical regression analysis used to determine the line of best fit for a set of data with a range of uncertainty dispersion the systematic report and analysis of this range of uncertainty would help to strength the confidence of the described approaches 5 earth observation for kc b vi retrieval remote sensing technique has long been recognized as a very feasible means to provide spatially distributed information of crop coefficients through kc b vi approaches for several crop systems the use of remote sensing for such application can be grounded on the conventional top view approach optical sensors either from airborne platforms airplanes drones etc or spaceborne platforms earth observation satellites eos the present paper broadly explores the usefulness of satellite imagery for applying kc b vi approaches the minimum suitable satellite data requirements to apply this approach are multispectral observations in the visible vis and near infrared nir spectrum satellite data with medium high spatial resolution has been available since 1970 with the start of the landsat series 30 m vis nir 16 day revisit and after in the 1980s with the satellites pour l observation de la terre spot e g spot 1 2 3 with 20 m in vis nir at the time both landsat and spot imagery were costly and though the spatial resolution of these eos enabled mapping vis of clustered and single fields as well as perceiving the within field variation the associated cost the images availability and the long revisit time were limiting factors in the 1990s there were important developments in sensor technology which significantly improved spatial resolution and data technology with the digital form decisively taking over toward the end of the decade there was a race for space exploitation by commercial companies which led to the first high resolution satellite sensor in 1999 ikonos 4 m in vis nir subsequently numerous multispectral high and very high spatial resolution satellite sensors have emerged e g quickbird 2 4 m in vis nir spot 4 to spot 7 6 20 m in vis nir 1 5 days revisiting worldview2 pleiades rapideye dmc and deimos 1 5 m in vis nir providing land observations with improved capabilities calera et al 2017 however these sensors are not routinely employed for crop monitoring because their imagery are not public domain the imagery archive for specific locations is rather low although programmed acquisitions are possible and come at a significant cost rendering too expensive for most operational agricultural applications and therefore with few application in kc b vi estimation in the 2000s the advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer aster 15 m in the vis nir 16 days revisiting and the moderate resolution imaging spectrometer sensors modis 250 m in the nir vis near daily coverage have arose problems in continuous data acquisition of aster sensor due to communication constraints have limited its use in operational monitoring applications glenn et al 2007 modis although with a very high temporal resolution has too coarse resolution to detect within field variability in kc b vi applications e g mahmoud and gan 2019 however modis data is often combined with ground data maselli et al 2014 or other eos sensors e g landsat to improve the radiometric and temporal resolution of data allowing putative operational use in crop monitoring and kc b vi applications e g gao et al 2015 mokhtari et al 2018 the free and open access policy of the landsat archive implemented in 2008 has fostered a new era of analytical approaches for describing land surface condition and dynamics woodcock et al 2008 additionally the recent launch of esa sentinel 2 also with a free and open access policy has been a great step forward for the continuity of operational systems for kc b vi monitoring and mapping at local regional and global scales the sentinel 2 mission is a constellation with two twin satellites sentinel 2a and sentinel 2b which carries the multi spectral instrument msi able to capture data at 10 m vis and broad nir 20 m red edge narrow nir and swir bands and 60 m atmospheric bands over 13 spectral bands and with a very high temporal resolution of five days at the equator e g transon et al 2018 the improvements in the spatial temporal and spectral e g red edge bands resolutions brought by sentinel 2 represent a major step forward compared to current multispectral missions and provide an excellent opportunity to explore new kc b vi approaches the sentinel 2 mission also provides enhanced continuity of the multispectral imagery by spot satellites series several hyperspectral missions will shortly be launched or are planned such as the italian mission precursore iperspettrale della missione applicativa prisma 30 m spatial resolution the german mission environmental mapping and analysis program enmap 30 m spatial resolution the japanese mission hyperspectral imager suite hisui 30 m spatial resolution and the nasa mission hyperspectral infrared imager hyspiri 60 m spatial resolution while the hyperspectral exploratory sensors enable to extract narrowband vis their applications to improve kc b estimation are still scarce bhojaraja et al 2015 medium spatial resolution long revisit time low signal to noise ratio in particular bottom of atmosphere reflectance of some hyperspectral sensors and the complex data processing are the main limitations compared to sentinel 2 transon et al 2018 nowadays landsat imagery is probably the most frequently used satellite data to generate vis to estimate crop coefficients in both annual and perennial crops campos et al 2010 2017 mateos et al 2013 pôças et al 2015 sawant et al 2016 toureiro et al 2017 vanino et al 2015 however the landsat 16 days revisiting period often extended by the presence of clouds may not be suitable to support irrigation management e g toureiro et al 2017 a temporal resolution of about 7 10 days between satellite overpass is usually considered adequate to monitor the crop growth phases throughout the crop cycle e g vuolo et al 2015b alternative current satellites also fail to simultaneously combine representative high spatial and temporal resolutions largely as a result of prohibitive costs of such systems fisher et al 2017 gao et al 2015 to overcome these difficulties from individual sensors the use of multi sensor remote sensing data and the latest sensor technologies have been considered to create a so called virtual constellation martínez beltrán et al 2009 this multi sensor approach requires a harmonization pre process with several complex steps which involve radiometric and geometric adjustments to make a consistent surface reflectance record for time series applications claverie et al 2018 however in some virtual constellations e g landsat and sentinel it is now possible to access the final high level information in near real time through the usgs http glovis usgs gov and copernicus https cophub copernicus eu sites in addition some companies like amazon s3 https aws amazon com s3 and google earth engine https earthengine google com are offering catalogues of satellite imagery time series from multi sensors at the planetary scale as well as additional cloud computing capabilities calera et al 2017 the most remarkable handicap on these days for the operational use of virtual constellations is the absence of operational procedures for the implementation of atmospheric corrections that ensures the compatibility across time space and sensors the virtual constellation data combining different sensors have been tested to improve kc b vi applications in several crops e g in pastures in australia using landsat 8 and sentinel 2 abuzar et al 2017 and in intensive crops i e sugarbeet potatoes and various vegetables and semi intensive crops such as cereals oilseed and maize in lower austria using landsat 8 and deimos vuolo et al 2015b the use of virtual constellation for both free e g landsat 8 and sentinel 2a and free and commercial e g landsat 8 and deimos sensors currently provides improved spatial and spectral resolution data with a time resolution of around one image per week calera et al 2017 toureiro et al 2017 vuolo et al 2015b in recent years there has been important developments in remote sensing technology and sensors development in terms of mass reduction cost and operability e g pre programed flights which make the use of unmanned aerial vehicles uav or drones viable for agricultural applications these systems present affordable costs to obtain images with very high resolution as well as with simplicity of operation and image processing gago et al 2015 examples of the use of uavs for the application of a kcb vi approach in maize are presented by tang et al 2019 and zhang et al 2019 in an operative scenario programmed data acquisitions with sensors onboard drones and uavs can be combined with satellite data to achieve a high temporal resolution acquisition adequate to monitor the various phases of the crop development throughout the growing season calera et al 2017 nevertheless the combined use of spaceborne and airborne data presents new challenges e g regarding the mentioned data harmonization for kc b vi approaches moreover the use of vis derived from uav has also been tested to assess ks based on a regression between the two variables in combination with a kcb vi approach tang et al 2019 however an independent assessment of the model accuracy and its evaluation over a longer time period is still necessary as acknowledge by those authors overall there is still a considerable gap between data and information for the case of kc b vi approaches the great potential offered by drones uav data is still yet to be fully realised 6 combining kcb vi approaches with soil water balance models swb 6 1 assessing evaporation coefficient ke with swb time series of spectral imagery provide operational kcb maps which can be ingested into the dual coefficient approach expressed in eq 1 and thus providing potential transpiration value maps once eto is known determination of etc to obtain crop water requirements cwr needs the classical approach as fao56 states for estimates of bare soil evaporation as indicated in the swot analysis provided in the fig 4 soil evaporation component has to be considered with ancillary models in the kcb vi approaches soil evaporation is a dominant loss component in many agro ecosystems accounting for up to 35 of total water losses and between 30 and 60 of etc bodner et al 2015 recent research demonstrated the feasibility of soil evaporation soil moisture estimates based on optical and radar signal amazirh et al 2018 however the feasibility of these techniques under partial and full cover conditions shall be evaluated and in our literature review we did not find comprehensive approaches linking the proposed method with kcb vi based estimates for the assessment of etc notwithstanding these techniques can be explored in the future the most common approach widely extended in the literature is the estimation of soil evaporation using relatively simple swb models broadly the two main factors considered for the estimation of soil evaporation are the evaporative atmospheric demand and the soil water availability merlin et al 2016 in practical terms any operational approach should rely on the measurement or estimation of the meteorological conditions evaporative demand soil properties related with the water holding capacity and measurements or estimates of the soil water content in the layer of the soil exposed to evaporation the swb approaches can be based on either simple approaches with low data requirements or more complex models that require detailed descriptions of the processes unavoidable for studies at large scale a well accepted and operational approach is proposed in the fao 56 manual allen et al 1998 as a complement to the dual crop coefficient approach described in the section 1 the methodology relies on the estimation of the evaporation coefficient ke it is based on a single layer swb performed in the root zone including additions relative to the simulation of soil evaporation from the surface layer to compute daily information of ke as 27 k e k r k c m a x k c b f e w k c m a x where kr is a dimensionless soil evaporation reduction coefficient kc max is the maximum value of crop coefficient and few is the fraction of the soil that is both wetted and exposed from which most of the evaporation occurs the eq 27 considers that as the topsoil layer dries less water is available for evaporation and thus a reduction in evaporation occurs in proportion to the amount of water that remains in the surface soil layer allen et al 1998 rosa et al 2016 the parameters necessary for computing ke following eq 27 are detailed in table 3 6 2 combining kcb vi with swb for assessing actual kc the actual kc is calculated as the sum of kcb and ke reduced by any occurrence of water stress conditions eq 2 as previously mentioned complementary methodologies either models simulating the swb at the root zone or thermal based indicators may be necessary to adjust kc b for stress conditions when applying the kc b vi approaches the most commonly used methodology for such purpose consists in the application of a daily swb at the root zone for estimating the water stress factor ks the ks can be expressed as a linear function of the water depletion depth per day at the root zone dr following the procedures defined in fao56 allen et al 1998 28a k s t a w d r 1 ρ t a w f o r d r r a w 28b k s 1 f o r d r r a w where taw is the total available water in the root zone corresponding to the amount of water that a crop can extract from its root zone raw is the readily available water i e the fraction of taw that a crop can extract from the root zone without suffering water stress and ρ is the average fraction of taw that can be depleted from the root zone before moisture stress occurs the taw is computed as a function of the soil water content at field capacity and at wilting point and of the crop rooting depth the parameters necessary for computing ks following equation 28 are detailed in table 3 thus the combined use of kcb vi approaches with swb models allows a spatial representation of the actual kc including under stress free and stress occurrence conditions and subsequently of actual etc various studies report such combined use e g campos et al 2010 2013 gonzález dugo and mateos 2008 mateos et al 2013 odi lara et al 2016 pôças et al 2015 7 integrating kcb vi solutions and thermal based approaches combining kcb vi relationships and thermal based approaches allows overcoming the limitations of temporal representativeness and water stress assessment of the most common remote sensing methods for et the two types of methodologies differ in the nature of the input data the physics of the process analyzed and the models ability to reproduce different processes the thermal based approaches are based on the capability to estimate et even under water stress conditions by using as primary input the surface temperature recorded by the remote sensing methodologies however currently the satellite missions providing coincident optical and thermal data at fine spatial and temporal resolutions are still limited wulder et al 2019 the kcb vi approach solely based on optical data takes advantage of the demonstrated capability of vis to provide a precise estimation of the canopy potential transpiration as discussed in this paper therefore both models are complementary through the estimation of actual and potential et combining both approaches takes advantage of this complementarity in a synergist perspective to gather additional information about the analyzed canopies the existing attempts to integrate thermal based surface energy balance seb approaches mainly focus on the improvement of the weaknesses of the models some previous works considered the combination of seb and remote sensing water balance methodologies using one of the approaches as the central core and the other approach as a support to solve specific problems in this sense singh and irmak 2009 estimated a kc vi relationship based on the kc values obtained by the ratio between actual et values derived from the seb model metric allen et al 2007 and a reference et computed from meteorological data similar combinations of both approaches have been published by santos et al 2012 for olive canopies and by droogers and bastiaanssen 2002 for a river basin scale in a deepest analysis various researches have proposed an inversion procedure of the ks formulation in this sense colaizzi et al 2003 combined the thermal infrared based crop water stress index cwsi jackson et al 1981 and different ks formulations that are based on soil water depletion this procedure allows evaluating the estimated soil water depletion which is estimated by using a swb gonzález dugo et al 2006 also explored the use of remotely sensed canopy temperature combined with swb to assess the variability of plant water stress at field scale kullberg et al 2017 compared various methodologies based on the canopy temperature for estimating the ks which were further evaluated within a swb model using the fao 56 dual crop coefficient approach other approaches based on the inversion of swb formulation have been oriented to correct the soil water depletion and plant water stress estimates barker et al 2018 proposed the assimilation of the et estimated using a seb model to correct the et estimated through a swb model the corrected et values are used to update the estimated soil water depletion and then the ks is recalculated based on the same model campos et al 2015 explored the inversion of the swb for the identification of irrigated fields and the estimation of irrigation doses similar approaches have been proposed by schuurmans et al 2003 for assimilating et values calculated using the seb algorithm sebal bastiaanssen et al 1998 in a spatially distributed hydrological model crow et al 2008 er raki et al 2008 and anderson et al 2007 also proposed assimilating thermal remote sensing based et into a swb model for correcting the discrepancies between both models recently olivera guerra et al 2020 proposed a new approach for the retrieval of irrigation amount and timing at field scale based on remotely sensed optical and thermal data through this approach the ks derived based on land surface temperature data and the fraction of vegetation cover assessed through a vi are further integrated into a water balance model for retrieving irrigation at pixel scale 8 operational initiatives based on kcb vi solutions as presented and discussed in the previous sections canopy reflectance as it is recorded by time series of multispectral imagery can be directly converted through kcb vi relationships into maps of kcb or transpiration coefficient interpolation techniques between close in time images allow producing daily maps of the reflectance based kcb values taking advantage of smooth continuous curves described by the evolving vegetation canopy and so avoiding the effects of cloudiness the interpolation of vis between satellite consecutive measurements to daily values can be done by different functions including linear e g gonzález dugo et al 2013 gonzález dugo and mateos 2008 mateos et al 2013 cubic e g er raki et al 2010b or more complex functions aimed at representing the actual pattern of crop development campos et al 2017 these latter authors defined functions for daily interpolation according to the crops growth phase by comparing the vi values and the corresponding growing degree days during several field campaigns of maize and soybean i an exponential equation was fitted for the initial phase fast development of vi values while ii a compertz sigmoid function was set for the plateau relatively stable vi values and descending vi values decreasing due to senescence periods the product of the daily kcb maps and eto provide directly the daily potential transpiration on a pixel by pixel basis it represents the maximum transpiration value that a determined unstressed vegetation canopy can reach under a determined atmosphere evaporative power the knowledge of this reflectance based transpiration ceiling value is of paramount relevance for operational crop water management allen et al 2011 summarizes the advantages of kcb vi estimation for irrigation assessment as a probably the simplest method to introduce the remote sensing data in the operational application of the penman monteith formulation for et assessment known as the two step methodology which enables quick analyses that can be made by mid level technicians b large areas can be covered and c very high spatial resolution if aerial imagery is used as a result of the recognition of the kcb vi approaches efforts have been made in the last years to connect them with interactive spatial data infrastructures and complementary technologies aimed at easily and timely communicating cwr related data to users 8 1 web gis technologies and mobile apps web mapping applications and geolocation solutions have greatly expanded over the past years in liaison to the rising availability of spatial data and in response to the need to obtain spatially distributed information of biophysical and environmental parameters to support improved resources management including water also the current easy access to digital platforms and technologies makes users more prone to use data communicated through this via in such context the combined use of satellite data web gis tools and mobile apps has been increasingly used in integrated systems for information delivery aimed at supporting irrigation management tasks examples of such systems include the irrisatsms in australia https irrisat cloud appspot com tops sims in california http ec2 54

irrisat in southern italy http www irrisat it eo4water in lower austria http eo4water com and irri eye in southern australia all these systems are based on fao 56 procedures and use the relationship between the canopy reflectance and crop transpiration the irrisatsms system is based on a kcb ndvi relationship hornbuckle 2014 this system developed by csiro was originally applied for vineyards in the murrumbidgee irrigation area but now covers the entire australian continent originally the system was implemented to communicate with the stakeholders through a short messaging service sms interface and was later improved to include a web interface the most recent version of irrisatsms system makes use of google earth engine capabilities for image processing and algorithm implementation the tops satellite irrigation management support tops sims application was implemented within the nasa terrestrial observation and prediction system tops nemani et al 2009 this application provides near real time mapping of crop canopy conditions and associated cwr at the individual fields level through a web based user interface the tops sims integrates satellite data from landsat and modis with eto from meteorological information and ancillary data on crop type and site specific conditions a generalized kcb ndvi relationship is used in tops sims for near real time mapping of kcb and etc but crop specific kcb ndvi relationships can be introduced a posteriori when available melton et al 2012 spider is a web gis based on open source software developed by the university of castilla la mancha this system provides kcb curves based on ndvi time series from sentinel 2a sentinel 2b and landsat 8 images spider is able to display time series of raster and vector maps as well as time trajectories of pixel based values for the periods defined by the user the image processing is off line and a normalization process allows combining multiple image sources as a multi sensor virtual constellation a mobile app version of spider webgis agrisat app was released in 2016 and is available in the most common digital distribution platforms for mobile devices the irrisat eo4water and irri eye use a similar webgis platform developed in an open source software environment with a structure adapted to different areas for considering the specific requirements of the local users vuolo et al 2015a overall the basic information provided by each system includes images of vis color composites relative to the satellite data and core biophysical parameters derived from these images and related with water use like the crop coefficients and cwr all the systems allow user to visualize the images and query the information for different dates or time periods thus providing a spatio temporal analysis additionally all the systems present an option to display the location of the user or device in the maps which can be used to identify areas of interest in the field e g zones with unusual crop development 8 2 remote sensing based decision support systems the remotely sensed kcb vi based systems presented in the previous sub section can feed satellite based irrigation advisory services the information provided to the end user can vary from cumulative transpiration kcb to actual irrigation water requirements iwr based on the information provided by the user for example irrisatsms is able to calculate on the fly a swb for an user drawn polygon and allows to estimate and update the actual iwr and soil water content based on the information provided by the end user other web gis systems like spider also present the capability to display information about iwr and other components of the satellite based swb to the user but in this case the processing is done off line the information provided to the user can be based on different spatial scales i e pixel multiple pixels plots according to the systems comparatively to the traditional irrigation advisory services the satellite based systems have the advantage of reflecting the actual conditions of the canopy over a spatially and temporally distributed frame covering large areas and providing within field heterogeneity information and fostering a more efficient use of water for irrigation by allowing tailored recommendations per individual plot and a timely delivery of information calera et al 2017 calera belmonte et al 2005 vuolo et al 2015a 8 3 forecasting crop water requirements one of the current challenges to the remotely sensed kcb vi based systems relies on forecasting the cwr with sufficient anticipation to allow modifying the irrigation scheduling adapted to the power supply rates water availability irrigation system precipitation probability and farmer s availability one week ahead is considered a reasonable anticipation providing enough time and still ensuring the accuracy of the cwr forecast calera et al 2017 for such purpose the extrapolation of the kc and kcb data and the weather forecasts for eto prediction are required the extrapolation of reflectance based kcb takes advantage of the smooth shape of kcb curves derived from time trajectories of vis making suitable extrapolating using previous dates for short periods as one week the extrapolation of short term eto can be used based on i numeric weather forecasts to determine the variables required to apply fao56 guidelines allen et al 1998 ii daily temperature forecasting by using it as input into hargreaves samani hargreaves and samani 1982 nevertheless for proper functioning the hargreaves samani equation should be restricted to no windy and no coastal humid areas e g nandagiri and kovoor 2006 temesgen et al 2005 and where no forecasting of other meteorological variables than temperature is available

available sources of global reanalysis data that can be used for mapping weekly predicted eto e g hirlam high resolution local area modelling for numerical weather prediction and the european ecwmf

communication tops sims still do not incorporate this product although the system architecture facilitates the forecast of potential consumptive use and associated irrigation demand with lead times of up to one week melton et al 2012 a commercial development of the cwr prediction based on kcb vi relationships has already been developed in spain http www agrisat es 9 concluding remarks the accurate estimation and spatial determination of actual water requirements is paramount for ensuring an efficient use and sustainable management of water as called by the agenda for sustainable development goals united nations 2015 the fao56 method has long been used as a standard procedure for estimating etc through a single or dual kc and an eto the notable advances in remote sensing technologies in the last decades created the opportunity for the effective use of spectral information often in the form of vis in support to agricultural applications including those related with the estimation of kc and kcb as discussed in the previous sections by providing spatially distributed information throughout the crops cycle with an increasingly short revisiting cycle resulting from combining data from various satellite missions and sensors platforms the kc b vi approaches are useful for irrigation management including in a context of precision irrigation nevertheless for better matching the cwr and the irrigation rates the kc b vi products should be used in combination with soil water balance models or thermal based models aimed at obtaining information about actual kc kcb and etc as discussed various studies have shown the good performance of kc b vi approaches through the comparison between etc estimated and measured table 4 following their good performance in estimating cwr through actual etc the methodologies combining kc b vi approaches are now presented as a mature technology and thus are increasingly being recognized as an operational tool for supporting irrigation scheduling also the kc b vi approaches can be used for analyzing etc requirements among irrigation campaigns with positive impact on irrigation planning as discussed in this paper there is a large diversity of kc b vi relationships tested and applied for different crop types climatic and agronomic conditions therefore besides following the good practices enunciated in section 4 3 efforts should be made towards setting the most adequate approaches by comparing the different methodologies under a large set of agro environmental conditions beyond the existing development further lines of research related with kc b vi approaches should be explored in the future for example the integration of kc b vi relationships with thermal based approaches in a synergist manner with the purpose of retrieving additional data from the analyzed canopies different thermal based indicators and approaches should be tested and compared for assessing crop water stress and actual crop coefficients while considering the need for designing accurate data friendly and easy to use approaches that can be applied to feed improved operational initiatives thermal infrared data from currently available satellite missions and systems e g landsat program and iss ecostress ecosystem spaceborne thermal radiometer experiment on space station as well as future systems e g hyperspectral infrared imager hyspiri to be launched in 2022 and sentinel 8 to be launched in 2024 and systems based on manned airborne technology provide a good basis and new opportunities for this research topic additionally

are anticipated to at least double by 2050 cimmyt 2011 there is an increasing focus on assessing the yield improvement opportunities to meet the future food demands mueller et al 2012 china is the world s second largest producer and consumer of maize in 2017 maize production in china accounted for 22 of the total harvest area and 23 of the total production in the world fao 2017 that makes maize production in china have important implications for global food security with economic growth and changing diets demand for maize in china is predicted to increase by 47 by 2030 chen et al 2014 however china s maize yield has been stagnant at approximately 5 mg ha 1 since 1995 in 42 of counties in cropping areas meng et al 2013 wei et al 2015 despite agricultural inputs e g nitrogen and

maintain yield stability under climate change using rnwi is a straightforward and easily accepted management practice for agricultural production improvement in the previous studies maize yield gaps between yp and ya and the affecting factors had been assessed in the main cropping areas in china liu et al 2017 2012 meng et al 2013 tao et al 2015 zhao and lobell 2017 nevertheless yield stability has been becoming a hot debate because of the increased extreme events and disasters under climate change basso et al 2019 jin et al 2019 maestrini and basso 2018 which had been rarely focused on furthermore few studies have attempted to estimate the contribution of nutrient and water management to total grain production improvement in this study the three main cropping regions the north china spring maize region ncs the huanghuaihai summer maize region hs and the southwest china mountain maize region scm in china were selected as research area we used a well validated crop model apsim maize v7 6 with actual climatic and soil data to estimate maize exploitable yield and yield under rnwi yn w in the three regions for 1981 2010 and the recorded county level ya of maize in each region

rgp could be improved through rnwi and 2 except for rnwi how much of the average and stability of grain yield and rgp could still be improved through other management and technologies the findings would provide a theoretical basis for efficient water and nitrogen inputs for food security in china 2 materials and methods 2 1 maize actual yield level stability zones as the three main cropping regions in china maize sowing areas in ncs 9 million ha hs 8 million ha and scm 3 million ha accounted for more than 90 of all maize grown in the country wang and li 2010 in this study maize potential planting areas with annually 10 c accumulated temperatures above 2100 c d in the three regions were selected as the research areas zhao and yang 2018a in the study areas the average thermal time effective precipitation and photosynthesis active radiation were 1324 c d 158 mm and 1641 mj m 2 in ncs 1645 c d 131 mm and 963 mj m 2 in hs and 2229 c d 376 mm and 1951 mj m 2 in scm respectively during the maize growing season from 1981 to 2010 zhao and yang 2018a fig s1 county level data on maize ya and cropping areas in the research area from 1981 to 2010 were obtained from the agricultural statistical yearbook the ministry of agriculture of china 2019 in our previous study maize cropping areas were characterized as yield level stability zones high and stable yields high unstable zones high and unstable yields low stable zones low and stable yields and low unstable zones low and unstable yields based on the threshold values of the averages and coefficients of variation cvs of ya at

archontoulis et al 2014 gaydon et al 2017 keating et al 2003 was selected to simulate yp using the historical climatic data 1981 2010 for the study regions according to the maize trial data from the 14 agrometeorological experimental stations and climatic data from the nearest meteorological stations the apsim maize model performed well in each region zhao and yang 2018b because the trial cultivars in agrometeorological experimental stations were also the major cultivars grown by the local farmers they were assumed to be planted across the corresponding nearby provinces each trial cultivar was calibrated for one two provinces to obtain province specific crop coefficients for the subsequent model analysis in ncs and scm the thermal start date of the maize growing season was used as the planting date in each year when yp was simulated as 99 and 89 of the maize cropping areas respectively are planted with spring maize that is sown in spring and harvested in autumn however 99 of maize cropping areas in hs are planted with summer maize because the sowing of summer maize is restricted by the end of the season and harvest of the previously cultivated winter wheat the sowing date is not flexible in hs to account for the winter wheat growing season in this area the average observed planting date from the agrometeorological experimental stations in each province was input into the model for hs additionally nitrogen input levels were set such that nitrogen was not limiting for any of the yield simulations the planting densities in each region were set as the recommended densities according to li and wang 2010 the planting depth was set as 50 mm and the row spacing was 60 cm detailed descriptions of the simulations and model assessments were described in our previous study zhao and yang 2018b the yp in each year from 1981 to 2010 at 331 meteorological stations was simulated by apsim maize since farm yields ya tend to plateau at 75 85 of yp cassman 1999 cassman et al 2003 a threshold value of 80 potential ceiling was selected for ye van ittersum et al 2013 lobell et al 2009 the average and cv of ye during the studied period were calculated to reflect the ye level and stability at each station respectively as ya were recorded at the county level in the agricultural statistical yearbook we linked the field scale apsim maize model with the geospatial analysis tool in arcgis software to interpolate the point based ye to the county level in the three cropping regions the inverse distance weighting idw method in arcgis 10 0 software was used to interpolate the averages and cvs of ye across the entire region the zonal tool was selected to obtain the averages and cvs for ye in each county 2 3 yield under recommended nitrogen and water inputs with the different yield targets different nitrogen and irrigation rates were recommended by local agronomists based on the actual agricultural production we selected the maximum values in each region as rnwi and listed in table 1 li et al 2013a b c the rnwi were set in the apsim maize model to simulate maize yn w at each meteorological station in the three main maize cropping regions in china depending on the availability of data the same nutrient and water inputs were applied in each region similar to the methods for ye the idw method and the zonal tool in arcgis 10 0 software were used to obtain the county level averages and cvs of yn w in the studied regions 2 4 improvements in yield level and stability according to the definitions and ideas of different levels yield gaps and their limiting factors from van ittersum et al 2013 the differences in the average and cv between ya and yn w were calculated as the improvements arising from the application of rnwi in yield level and

ha 1 and 7 1 mg ha 1 in ncs hs and scm respectively from 1981 to 2010 fig 1 a and table 2 the highest yn w was found in the western and eastern portion of ncs and eastern portion of hs with a yn w of over 10 mg ha 1 in 58 and 15 of the maize cropping areas in ncs and hs respectively however only 1 of cropping areas may produce more than 10 mg ha 1 in the southern portion of scm under rnwi in hs the average yn w ranged from 7 to 10 mg ha 1 in 60 of the maize cropping areas the average yn w was 5 8 mg ha 1 in 79 of the maize cropping areas in scm the mean cv of maize yn w during 1981 2010 was 0 27 0 25 and 0 12 in ncs hs and scm respectively fig 2 b and table 2 the areas with the most stable yn w were found in 96 of the cropping areas in scm with yn w cvs below 0 20 and the area proportions were much greater than that in ncs 32 in the eastern portion and hs 21 in the southern portion in ncs cropping areas with poor yn w stability were found in most of the middle portions and the area proportion with yn w cvs above 0 20 was 45 in hs 58 of the maize cropping areas showed yn w cvs between 0 20 and 0 30 3 2 improvements in yield level comparisons of the averages and cvs of the estimated ye and yn w and ya in the counties in the three main maize cropping regions from 1981 to 2010 and the improvements in yield levels and stabilities of ya through rnwi and omt are shown in figs 2 and 3 the average changes in ya through rnwi during the study period were 35 5 mg ha 1 27 3 mg ha 1 and 41 3 mg ha 1 in ncs hs and scm respectively the improvements in low yield zones low stable and low unstable zones were greater than those in high yield zones high stable and high unstable zones in all three cropping regions in ncs and hs the planting area distributions decreased with yields between 5 and 10 mg ha 1 but increased with yields above 5 mg ha 1 under rnwi in high stable and high unstable zones respectively fig 2 however the yield improvements under rnwi were significantly p 0 001 related to drained upper limit dul 15bar lower limit ll15 and soil organic carbon soc in ncs while weak relationships p 0 05 were detected in hs table s3 the planting area distributions increased with yields above 5 mg ha 1 in all four zones under rnwi in scm the largest improvements in ya levels were found in the high unstable 61 5 mg ha 1 and low unstable 45 4 mg ha 1 zones in scm and the improvements were significantly p 0 01 related to dul ll15 and soc furthermore ya may be improved through omt by 29 4 mg ha 1 34 4 mg ha 1 and 14 1 mg ha 1 in ncs hs and scm respectively in ncs compared to the planting area distributions of yn w those of ye decreased with yields below 12 mg ha 1 in the high stable zone but increased with yields between 12 and 15 mg ha 1 in the high unstable zone and the average improvements in ya through omt were 34 4 mg ha 1 and 35 4 mg ha 1 in the two high yield zones compared with the planting area distributions of yn w those of ye decreased with yields between 5 and 10 mg ha 1 in both high stable and high unstable zones in hs in scm similar yield improvements through omt were found in all four zones and the average improvement was 11 1 mg ha 1 13 1 mg ha 1 12 1 mg ha 1 and 18 2 mg ha 1 in high stable high unstable low stable and low unstable zones respectively 3 3 improvements in yield stability the cvs of ya yn w and ye as the ratios of the standard deviation to the arithmetic mean can reflect stabilities during the study period with a lower cv representing a higher yield stability the average improvement in ya stability through rnwi was 0 13 0 04 and 0 14 in ncs hs and scm respectively the improvements in unstable yield zones high unstable and low unstable zones were greater than those in stable yield zones high stable and low stable zones in all three cropping regions fig 3 in ncs and scm the improvement in yield stability was 0 22 and 0 23 in the high unstable zone and 0 26 and 0 27 in the low unstable zone respectively which were greater than those in hs 0 09 and 0 14 statistically significant p 0 01 correlations were detected between yield stability improvements and ll15 and soc in all the three regions while yield stability improvements were significantly p 0 001 related to dul in ncs table s3 furthermore ya stability may be improved by 0 12 0 15 and 0 01 in ncs hs and scm respectively through omt in ncs the planting area distributions of ye decreased with yield cvs above 0 18 but increased with yield cvs between 0 08 and 0 15 in all four zones compared to those of yn w in hs yield stabilities were substantially improved in all four zones by omt and the average improvement was 0 16 0 16 0 17 and 0 14 in high stable high unstable low stable and low unstable zones respectively nevertheless there were improvements in yield stabilities by omt in high stable and high unstable zones in scm and the average improvement was 0 02 and 0 03 in low stable and low unstable zones respectively 3 4 improvements in reliable total grain production during 1981 2010 the potential improvement in rgp through rnwi was 36 37 million mg 24 22 million mg and 44 10 million mg in ncs hs and scm respectively in all three regions the lowest improvement ratios for rgp were found in high stable zones where they were 30 13 million mg 18 80 million mg and 31 22 million mg in ncs hs and scm respectively the rgp was improved by 44 12 million mg in high unstable zone in ncs which represented the highest improvement ratios through rnwi however the highest improvement ratios for rgp were found in the low unstable zone in both hs 35 10 million mg and scm 51 3 million mg through omt the improvement in rgp was 33 34 million mg 44 41 million mg and 18 4 million mg in ncs hs and scm respectively in ncs and scm the lowest improvement ratios through omt were found in the high unstable zone 29 and 13 while the highest improvement ratios were found in the low unstable zone 44 and 25 however the opposite results were found in hs where the lowest improvement ratio through omt was in the low unstable zone 41 and the highest was in high unstable zone 48 fig 4 4 discussion with the challenge of increasing food demand but yield stagnation field managements are expected to narrow the exploitable yield gap challinor et al 2016 liu et al 2013 mueller et al 2012 tao and zhang 2010 among the management practices the use of rnwi at the critical stages is considered as an effective approach to improve the grain yield and maintain yield stability mueller et al 2012 in this study we quantified the improvements in the average yield yield stability and rgp through rnwi and omt in the three main maize cropping regions in china in contrast to previous narrowing yield gap analysis liu et al 2017 2016 meng et al 2013 tao et al 2015 wang et al 2014b this study brings two innovative aspects firstly not only the average yield but yield stability and total grain production improvements were also included which may provide more information to decision makers under future variable climate scenarios secondly we estimated the improvements in four types of yield level stability zones that would be helpful to find the focused areas with the limited resources in the current study a yn w over 10 mg ha 1 was found at the western and eastern portions of ncs and eastern portion of hs which occupied 58 and 15 of the maize cropping areas in the two regions respectively and the yields were higher than scm chen et al 2012 also reported most of the high yield plots were located in ncs and hs by surveys moreover the areas with the most stable yn w were found in 96 of the cropping areas in scm with yn w cvs below 0 20 and the area proportions were larger than those in ncs 32 in the eastern portion and hs 21 in the southern portion that could be attributed to the much more precipitation in scm than two other regions in addition distributions of yn w cvs were positively correlated with those of precipitation cvs in the three regions zhao and yang 2018a which indicated that yield stability still mainly depended on the stability of precipitation although irrigation may improve yield stability comparing to ncs 35 0 13 and 36 and scm 41 0 14 and 44 the averages and cvs of ya and rgp in hs were improved 27 0 04 and 24 by rnwi respectively according to data from the agricultural statistical yearbook of china nitrogen inputs and irrigated areas in hs 10 million mg n and 17 million ha were bigger than those in ncs 3 million mg and 4 million ha and scm 4 million mg and 6 million ha during 1986 2010 which may explain why the improvement in maize yield level and stability through rnwi in hs was less than that in the other two regions in addition less than 200 mm of effective precipitation in the western portion of ncs zhao and yang 2018a and seasonal drought in scm during the maize growing season liu et al 2014 may also explain why maize yield stabilities were improved to a greater extent under rnwi in ncs and scm than in hs nevertheless optimum nitrogen and water management may not only improve yield but also enhance agricultural sustainability by increasing resource use efficiency and reducing nutrient losses and greenhouse gas emissions ju et al 2009 shen et al 2013 because nitrogen leaching increased exponentially with the n fertilizer application rate wang et al 2014a the optimum nitrogen input is determined by subtracting measured soil mineral nitrogen in the root zone from target values meng et al 2012 based on the crop nitrogen demand optimum nitrogen management could significantly reduce environmental risk without sacrificing crop yields ju et al 2009 wang et al 2017 which were reported in the cases of maize productions in parts of hs and ncs cui et al 2013 chen et al 2011 water input should also be recommended based on soil moisture and rainfall in practices however a consistent nitrogen and water input was used in the simulation in each region for the studied period which cannot be suitable for each field except for nutrient and water management narrowing exploitable yield gap with greater environmental protection can also be driven by improved agronomic management and technologies wang et al 2014a based on the current study the average yield cvs of yield and rgp over the three regions could still be increased by 28 3 mg ha 1 0 10 and 36 80 million mg through omt for example positive contributions to yield improvement by hybrids have been reported by a number of studies and 40 60 of yield improvement has been attributed to breeding effort in u s duvick 2005a 2005b and 35 5 in china hu et al 1998 although it cannot be totally achieved by the currently available technologies in the field aspects of scenario in ye may be achievable through precise nutrient and water management integrated soil crop system management and some other agronomic technologies including plastic film mulching optimal maize planting density drip irrigation precision sowing and mechanical harvest chen et al 2011 liu et al 2009 wang and li 2010 among the four types of yield level stability zones greater contributions of using rnwi and omt to improve maize grain yield yield stability and rgp were found in low unstable yield zones in all the three regions that highlights the focus on increasing maize yield in low unstable yield zones could provide the biggest return 5 conclusion the average maize yield could be increased by 33 4 mg ha 1 through rnwi when compared to the county level maize observed yield in the three main cropping regions while the improvements in cvs of grain yield and rgp were 0 11 and 32 69 million mg respectively moreover except for rnwi the average yield cvs of yield and rgp could further be increased by 28 3 mg ha 1 0 10 and 36 80 million mg through omt more in depth analysis of four types of yield level stability zones indicated that the improvements of maize grain yield yield stability and rgp using rnwi were found to be higher in zones with low unstable yield across the three regions in addition to rnwi a focus on increasing the average grain yield yield stability and rgp in low unstable yield zone through omt also provided the greatest return declaration of competing interest the authors declare no competing interests acknowledgements this work was supported

furthermore few studies have attempted to estimate the contribution of nutrient and water management to total grain production improvement in this study the three main cropping regions the north china spring maize region ncs the huanghuaihai summer maize region hs and the southwest china mountain maize region scm in china were selected as research area we used a well validated crop model apsim maize v7 6 with actual climatic and soil data to estimate maize exploitable yield and yield under rnwi yn w in the three regions for 1981 2010 and the recorded county level ya of maize in each region was also collected the purpose of this study is to answer the following questions 1 how much of the average and stability coefficient of variability cv of grain yield and reliable grain productions rgp could be improved through rnwi and 2 except for rnwi how much of the average and stability of grain yield and rgp could still be improved through other management and technologies the findings would provide a theoretical basis for efficient water and nitrogen inputs for food security in china 2 materials and methods 2 1 maize actual yield level stability zones as the three main cropping regions in china maize sowing areas in ncs 9 million ha hs 8 million ha and scm 3 million ha accounted for more than 90 of all maize grown in the country wang and li 2010 in this study maize potential planting areas with annually 10 c accumulated temperatures above 2100 c d in the three regions were selected as the research areas zhao and yang 2018a in the study areas the average thermal time effective precipitation and photosynthesis active radiation were 1324 c d 158 mm and 1641 mj m 2 in ncs 1645 c d 131 mm and 963 mj m 2 in hs and 2229 c d 376 mm and 1951 mj m 2 in scm respectively during the maize growing season from 1981 to 2010 zhao and yang 2018a fig s1 county level data on maize ya and cropping areas in the research area from 1981 to 2010 were obtained from the agricultural statistical yearbook the ministry of agriculture of china 2019 in our previous study maize cropping areas were characterized as yield level stability zones high and stable yields high unstable zones high and unstable yields low stable zones low and stable yields and low unstable zones low and unstable yields based on the threshold values of the averages and coefficients of variation cvs of ya at 50 of the cumulative frequencies in each region zhao et al 2018 distributions and areas of maize recorded yield level stability zones are shown in fig s2 which could also be found in zhao et al 2018 2

archontoulis et al 2014 gaydon et al 2017 keating et al 2003 was selected to simulate yp using the historical climatic data 1981 2010 for the study regions according to the maize trial data from the 14 agrometeorological experimental stations and climatic data from the nearest meteorological stations the apsim maize model performed well in each region zhao and yang 2018b because the trial cultivars in agrometeorological experimental stations were also the major cultivars grown by the local farmers they were assumed to be planted across the corresponding nearby provinces each trial cultivar was calibrated for one two provinces to obtain province specific crop coefficients for the subsequent model analysis in ncs and scm the thermal start date of the maize growing season was used as the planting date in each year when yp was simulated as 99 and 89 of the maize cropping areas respectively are planted with spring maize that is sown in spring and harvested in autumn however 99 of maize cropping areas in hs are planted with summer maize because the sowing of summer maize is restricted by the end of the season and harvest of the previously cultivated winter wheat the sowing date is not flexible in hs to account for the winter wheat growing season in this area the average observed planting date from the agrometeorological experimental stations in each province was input into the model for hs additionally nitrogen input levels were set such that nitrogen was not limiting for any of the yield simulations the planting densities in each region were set as the recommended densities according to li and wang 2010 the planting depth was set as 50 mm and the row spacing was 60 cm detailed descriptions of the simulations and model assessments were described in our previous study zhao and yang 2018b the yp in each year from 1981 to 2010 at 331 meteorological stations was simulated by apsim maize since farm yields ya tend to plateau at 75 85 of yp cassman 1999 cassman et al 2003 a threshold value of 80 potential ceiling was selected for ye van ittersum et al 2013 lobell et al 2009 the average and cv of ye during the studied period were calculated to reflect the ye level and stability at each station respectively as ya were recorded at the county level in the agricultural statistical yearbook we linked the field scale apsim maize model with the geospatial analysis tool in arcgis software to interpolate the point based ye to the county level in the three cropping regions the inverse distance weighting idw method in arcgis 10 0 software was used to interpolate the averages and cvs of ye across the entire region the zonal tool was selected to obtain the averages and cvs for ye in each county 2 3 yield under recommended nitrogen and water inputs with the different yield targets different nitrogen and irrigation rates were recommended by local agronomists based on the actual agricultural production we selected the maximum values in each region as rnwi and listed in table 1 li et al 2013a b c the rnwi were set in the apsim maize model to simulate maize yn w at each meteorological station in the three main maize cropping regions in china depending on the availability of data the same nutrient and water inputs were applied in each region similar to the methods for ye the idw method and the zonal tool in arcgis 10 0 software were used to obtain the county level averages and cvs of yn w in the studied regions 2 4 improvements in yield level and stability according to the definitions and ideas of different levels yield gaps and their limiting factors from van ittersum et al 2013 the differences in the average and cv between ya and yn w were calculated as the improvements arising from the application of rnwi in yield level and stability in each county respectively eqs 1 and 2 moreover the differences between ye and yn w were calculated as the yield improvement obtained with other management and technologies omt e g precise

ha 1 and 7 1 mg ha 1 in ncs hs and scm respectively from 1981 to 2010 fig 1 a and table 2 the highest yn w was found in the western and eastern portion of ncs and eastern portion of hs with a yn w of over 10 mg ha 1 in 58 and 15 of the maize cropping areas in ncs and hs respectively however only 1 of cropping areas may produce more than 10 mg ha 1 in the southern portion of scm under rnwi in hs the average yn w ranged from 7 to 10 mg ha 1 in 60 of the maize cropping areas the average yn w was 5 8 mg ha 1 in 79 of the maize cropping areas in scm the mean cv of maize yn w during 1981 2010 was 0 27 0 25 and 0 12 in ncs hs and scm respectively fig 2 b and table 2 the areas with the most stable yn w were found in 96 of the cropping areas in scm with yn w cvs below 0 20 and the area proportions were much greater than that in ncs 32 in the eastern portion and hs 21 in the southern portion in ncs cropping areas with poor yn w stability were found in most of the middle portions and the area proportion with yn w cvs above 0 20 was 45 in hs 58 of the maize cropping areas showed yn w cvs between 0 20 and 0 30 3 2 improvements in yield level comparisons of the averages and cvs of the estimated ye and yn w and ya in the counties in the three main maize cropping regions from 1981 to 2010 and the improvements in yield levels and stabilities of ya through rnwi and omt are shown in figs 2 and 3 the average changes in ya through rnwi during the study period were 35 5 mg ha 1 27 3 mg ha 1 and 41 3 mg ha 1 in ncs hs and scm respectively the improvements in low yield zones low stable and low unstable zones were greater than those in high yield zones high stable and high unstable zones in all three cropping regions in ncs and hs the planting area distributions decreased with yields between 5 and 10 mg ha 1 but increased with yields above 5 mg ha 1 under rnwi in high stable and high unstable zones respectively fig 2 however the yield improvements under rnwi were significantly p 0 001 related to drained upper limit dul 15bar lower limit ll15 and soil organic carbon soc in ncs while weak relationships p 0 05 were detected in hs table s3 the planting area distributions increased with yields above 5 mg ha 1 in all four zones under rnwi in scm the largest improvements in ya levels were found in the high unstable 61 5 mg ha 1 and low unstable 45 4 mg ha 1 zones in scm and the improvements were significantly p 0 01 related to dul ll15 and soc furthermore ya may be improved through omt by 29 4 mg ha 1 34 4 mg ha 1 and 14 1 mg ha 1 in ncs hs and scm respectively in ncs compared to the planting area distributions of yn w those of ye decreased with yields below 12 mg ha 1 in the high stable zone but increased with yields between 12 and 15 mg ha 1 in the high unstable zone and the average improvements in ya through omt were 34 4 mg ha 1 and 35 4 mg ha 1 in the two high yield zones compared with the planting area distributions of yn w those of ye decreased with yields between 5 and 10 mg ha 1 in both high stable and high unstable zones in hs in scm similar yield improvements through omt were found in all four zones and the average improvement was 11 1 mg ha 1 13 1 mg ha 1 12 1 mg ha 1 and 18 2 mg ha 1 in high stable high unstable low stable and low unstable zones respectively 3 3 improvements in yield stability the cvs of ya yn w and ye as the ratios of the standard deviation to the arithmetic mean can reflect stabilities during the study period with a lower cv representing a higher yield stability the average improvement in ya stability through rnwi was 0 13 0 04 and 0 14 in ncs hs and scm respectively the improvements in unstable yield zones high unstable and low unstable zones were greater than those in stable yield zones high stable and low stable zones in all three cropping regions fig 3 in ncs and scm the improvement in yield stability was 0 22 and 0 23 in the high unstable zone and 0 26 and 0 27 in the low unstable zone respectively which were greater than those in hs 0 09 and 0 14 statistically significant p 0 01 correlations were detected between yield stability improvements and ll15 and soc in all the three regions while yield stability improvements were significantly p 0 001 related to dul in ncs table s3 furthermore ya stability may be improved by 0 12 0 15 and 0 01 in ncs hs and scm respectively through omt in ncs the planting area distributions of ye decreased with yield cvs above 0 18 but increased with yield cvs between 0 08 and 0 15 in all four zones compared to those of yn w in hs yield stabilities were substantially improved in all four zones by omt and the average improvement was 0 16 0 16 0 17 and 0 14 in high stable high unstable low stable and low unstable zones respectively nevertheless there were improvements in yield stabilities by omt in high stable and high unstable zones in scm and the average improvement was 0 02 and 0 03 in low stable and low unstable zones respectively 3 4 improvements in reliable total grain production during 1981 2010 the potential improvement in rgp through rnwi was 36 37 million mg 24 22 million mg and 44 10 million mg in ncs hs and scm respectively in all three regions the lowest improvement ratios for rgp were found in high stable zones where they were 30 13 million mg 18 80 million mg and 31 22 million mg in ncs hs and scm respectively the rgp was improved by 44 12 million mg in high unstable zone in ncs which represented the highest improvement ratios through rnwi however the highest improvement ratios for rgp were found in the low unstable zone in both hs 35 10 million mg and scm 51 3 million mg through omt the improvement in rgp was 33 34 million mg 44 41 million mg and 18 4 million mg in ncs hs and scm respectively in ncs and scm the lowest improvement ratios through omt were found in the high unstable zone 29 and 13 while the highest improvement ratios were found in the low unstable zone 44 and 25 however the opposite results were found in hs where the lowest improvement ratio through omt was in the low unstable zone 41 and the highest was in high unstable zone 48 fig 4 4 discussion with the challenge of increasing food demand but yield stagnation field managements are expected to narrow the exploitable yield gap challinor et al 2016 liu et al 2013 mueller et al 2012 tao and zhang 2010 among the management practices the use of rnwi at the critical stages is considered as an effective approach to improve the grain yield and maintain yield stability mueller et al 2012 in this study we quantified the improvements in the average yield yield stability and rgp through rnwi and omt in the three main maize cropping regions in china in contrast to previous narrowing yield gap analysis liu et al 2017 2016 meng et al 2013 tao et al 2015 wang et al 2014b this study brings two innovative aspects firstly not only the average yield but yield stability and total grain production improvements were also included which may provide more information to decision makers under future variable climate scenarios secondly we estimated the improvements in four types of yield level stability zones that would be helpful to find the focused areas with the limited resources in the current study a yn w over 10 mg ha 1 was found at the western and eastern portions of ncs and eastern portion of hs which occupied 58 and 15 of the maize cropping areas in the two regions respectively and the yields were higher than scm chen et al 2012 also reported most of the high yield plots were located in ncs and hs by surveys moreover the areas with the most stable yn w were found in 96 of the cropping areas in scm with yn w cvs below 0 20 and the area proportions were larger than those in ncs 32 in the eastern portion and hs 21 in the southern portion that could be attributed to the much more precipitation in scm than two other regions in addition distributions of yn w cvs were positively correlated with those of precipitation cvs in the three regions zhao and yang 2018a which indicated that yield stability still mainly depended on the stability of precipitation although irrigation may improve yield stability comparing to ncs 35 0 13 and 36 and scm 41 0 14 and 44 the averages and cvs of ya and rgp in hs were improved 27 0 04 and 24 by rnwi respectively according to data from the agricultural statistical yearbook of china nitrogen inputs and irrigated areas in hs 10 million mg n and 17 million ha were bigger than those in ncs 3 million mg and 4 million ha and scm 4 million mg and 6 million ha during 1986 2010 which may explain why the improvement in maize yield level and stability through rnwi in hs was less than that in the other two regions in addition less than 200 mm of effective precipitation in the western portion of ncs zhao and yang 2018a and seasonal drought in scm during the maize growing season liu et al 2014 may also explain why maize yield stabilities were improved to a greater extent under rnwi in ncs and scm than in hs nevertheless optimum nitrogen and water management may not only improve yield but also enhance agricultural sustainability by increasing resource use efficiency and reducing nutrient losses and greenhouse gas emissions ju et al 2009 shen et al 2013 because nitrogen leaching increased exponentially with the n fertilizer application rate wang et al 2014a the optimum nitrogen input is determined by subtracting measured soil mineral nitrogen in the root zone from target values meng et al 2012 based on the crop nitrogen demand optimum nitrogen management could significantly reduce environmental risk without sacrificing crop yields ju et al 2009 wang et al 2017 which were reported in the cases of maize productions in parts of hs and ncs cui et al 2013 chen et al 2011 water input should also be recommended based on soil moisture and rainfall in practices however a consistent nitrogen and water input was used in the simulation in each region for the studied period which cannot be suitable for each field except for nutrient and water management narrowing exploitable yield gap with greater environmental protection can also be driven by improved agronomic management and technologies wang et al 2014a based on the current study the average yield cvs of yield and rgp over the three regions could still be increased by 28 3 mg ha 1 0 10 and 36 80 million mg through omt for example positive contributions to yield improvement by hybrids have been reported by a number of studies and 40 60 of yield improvement has been attributed to breeding effort in u s duvick 2005a 2005b and 35 5 in china hu et al 1998 although it cannot be totally achieved by the currently available technologies in the field aspects of scenario in ye may be achievable through precise nutrient and water management integrated soil crop system management and some other agronomic technologies including plastic film mulching optimal maize planting density drip irrigation precision sowing and mechanical harvest chen et al 2011 liu et al 2009 wang and li 2010 among the four types of yield level stability zones greater contributions of using rnwi and omt to improve maize grain yield yield stability and rgp were found in low unstable yield zones in all the three regions that highlights the focus on increasing maize yield in low unstable yield zones could provide the biggest return 5 conclusion the average maize yield could be increased by 33 4 mg ha 1 through rnwi when compared to the county level maize observed yield in the three main cropping regions while the improvements in cvs of grain yield and rgp were 0 11 and 32 69 million mg respectively moreover except for rnwi the average yield cvs of yield and rgp could further be increased by 28 3 mg ha 1 0 10 and 36 80 million mg through omt more in depth analysis of four types of yield level stability zones indicated that the improvements of maize grain yield yield stability and rgp using rnwi were found to be higher in zones with low unstable yield across the three regions in addition to rnwi a focus on increasing the average grain yield yield stability and rgp in low unstable yield zone through omt also provided the greatest return declaration of competing interest the authors declare no competing interests acknowledgements this work was supported

10679,the study of alternate bearing based on the seasonal changes pattern of tree carbohydrate is the unreviewed issue in the loading physiology of date phoenix dactylifera l trees on the other hand bunch cutting back is a crop improvement practice used in the date orchards and it is effective on flower induction and fruit set that regulates the quality and growth of fruit in the on year and the amount and yield of the produce in the off year research on an alternative thinning agent with the bunch cutting back is essential for dates in order to be economical and applicable in harsh climates for this purpose the experiment was conducted as a combined analysis across years based on randomized complete blocks on mazafati dates of 10 12 years old with different loading in 2017 off2017 normal2017 and on2017 as well as the on condition trees in 2017 plus bunch cutting back on2017 cutting back or regulated deficit irrigation on2017 rdi the main objectives of this study were to investigate the fragmentation of carbohydrate reserves of the tree in the annual rotation cycle in different loading to evaluate the relationship of sugar reserves with production and abscission of flowers and fruits to determine the effect of the rdi application in the on year on the pattern of sugar changes hydrolytic enzymes activity alternate bearing quantity and quality of the product and the possibility of replacing it with cutting back the results confirmed the significant effect of loading rate on the seasonal fragmentation and fluctuation of carbohydrates and the hydrolytic enzymes activity the results also showed that the rdi treatment due to the decrease of bunch length reduced the biennial bearing index bbi and improved the qualitative and quantitative traits of fruit better than the cutting back according to the results of this study the irrigation condition of trees has the potential to change the marketability and abscission of date fruits and this is a pioneer study of the rdi role as a thinning potential and moderating of date alternate bearing however further research is needed to justify the time and duration of this treatment application keywords fruit thinning biennial bearing index precocity carbohydrate abscission hydrolytic enzymes 1 introduction the alternate bearing means the production of a large number of small fruits in one year on year following the production of a small number of large fruit in the previous year sharma et al 2019 because of abscission off year in some fruit trees due to hormone or nutrition khan et al 2014 rosenstock et al 2010 which occurs in mazafati date phoenix dactylifera l trees because of nutritional imbalance between vegetative and reproductive organs pillay et al 2005 the palm trees have three waves of fruit abscission the first wave occurs a few weeks after pollination caused by the lack of fertilization and reduction of gibberellic acid produced by the seed nay and perring 2009 the second wave which is more serious is due to nutritional competition occurs in mid may at the end of the kimri and the beginning of the khalal stage and eventually the third wave occurs before harvesting due to the high temperature induced fruit wilting al qurashi et al 2012 othmani et al 2019 the alternate bearing is prevented by the old method of flowering and fruit thinning in on year which upgrades fruit dimensions reducing misshapen fruit and abscission by scattered fruits and bunch aeration lauri et al 2014 increasing maturity improving fruit coloring and controlling pests but sometimes this practice especially in wet areas increases the percentage of black nose fruits chao and krueger 2007 rosenstock et al 2010 fruit thinning in the dates is done using the following methods 1 bunch removal ratio of leaf bunch 10 dennis 2000 zaid and de wet 1999 2 bunch thinning cutting back remove the tip of the stalk removing strands hand thinning awad 2006 cohen et al 2010 3 chemical thinning 2 4 d ethephon and naa iwahori and oohata 1976 marashi et al 2012 the most appropriate method of date palm mazafati thinning is 5 cm cutting back ehsani 2007 deficit irrigation di means eliminating part of irrigation water that has no significant effect on yield shackel 2011 di under the influence of the time of application is called regulated deficit irrigation rdi which is the use of water in amounts less than the crop evapotranspiration etc in certain periods of the phonological stages of plant growth cuevas et al 2007 this method in contrast to the sustained deficit irrigation sdi focuses more on the crop physiology and is applied at times when the fruit growth is relatively slow and water stress will affect vegetative growth laribi et al 2013 the palm tree physiology shows that if the carbohydrate reserve is sufficient its flowering is carried out in january at 10 c chao and krueger 2007 at the development stage of the stalk february and march the fruit growth is slow and the water requirement is low but following the end of this stage late april a rapid increase in the growth and size of the fruit occurs when the water requirement increases and in the limitation of the water at this phenological stage will reduce the fruit growth and yield cohen et al 2010 gribaa et al 2013 decreasing vegetative growth reduces the competition for photosynthetic compounds between fruits and vegetative organs and thus increasing the size of fruits improves penetration of light into the crown and better fruit coloring faghih et al 2019 zhen et al 2019 di due to changes in the metabolism and the phloem supply produces high levels of secondary metabolites such as polyphenol compounds and antioxidants in fruits and increasing the organoleptic characteristics of fruits moreover di during the flowering lowers the fertilization and fruit set and the physiological thinning of immature fruits occurs in the first season khan and prathapar 2012 mpelasoka et al 2001 on the other hand di in some fruits causes prematurity behboudian and mills 1997 earlier maturation in these fruits can justify the no increase and even reduce the size of the fruit by di and theoretically treatments that change the size of the fruit change the quality firmness juice dilution soluble solids and fruit acids leib et al 2006 in case of any precocity and decrease in the size and quality of date fruit irrigation schedule of trees is one of the most important factors that should be carefully considered and for palm trees a history of di is reported at 65 75 etc in the developmental stage of the stalk alikhani koupaei et al 2018b gribaa et al 2013 all methods of fruit thinning require a lot of work and aren t cost effective therefore it is necessary to investigate other physiological methods gonzalez rossia et al 2006 in this regard the control of alternate bearing dates mazafati was studied using rdi and compared with the running method by the palm owners namely cutting back for two consecutive years 2 materials and methods 2 1 plant materials the present study was performed during two consecutive years of 2017 and 2018 on 10 12 years old mazafati date trees and 8 8 m spacing

subjected to uniform crop operation throughout the season under these conditions the emergence of the first spathes and cracking them were respectively february 4 and february 16 2017 and january 29 and february 6 2018 respectively and three waves fruit abscission in early march late may and early august occurred in both years harvesting of bunches was carried out about 190 200 days after pollination in both years and two bunches of trees in each treatment were harvested and the mean bunch weight was calculated on the other hand the yield of each tree was calculated from the mean

koupaei et al 2018b the four month weather conditions of the study area during the years of research are visible in table 1 before and after this period full irrigation with amount and intervals that are normal in the region 7 10 days in the warm months up to 21 27 days in cold months were carried out for this treatment as well as for the remaining treatments throughout the whole year the crop coefficient irrigation dates and water requirement of each tree during the four months and the whole year for rdi is listed in table 2 considering the ideal ratio of 10 leaves per bunch and 80 leaves for trees at the age of 10 12 years old zaid and de wet 1999 the trees that normally not using manual adjustment of bunch removal and in fact annual production based on the physiological history of each tree produce 10 8 and 6 bunches in 2017 were considered as on2017 year normal2017 bearing and off2017 year trees respectively for this experiment five groups of trees were considered 1 off year

content of the fruit was calculated in terms of the difference of fresh weight with dry weight three days staining of samples in an oven at 70 c because of the high sugar content of the dates it is not possible to directly measure the total soluble solid tss so with a mixture of 9 g of flesh fruit after separating the peel with 45 ml of water and after an hour from the fruit juice extract tss were determined by a digital refractometer dr 6000 a krus optronic gmbh germany zokaee khosroshahi and esna ashari 2007 the titration method was used to determine the titratable acid content of fruit in terms of malic acid per 100 g of sample to measure total phenol 200 mg of dried fruit was extracted with 2 ml of 80 methanol the extract was centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 20 min and the absorbance of supernatant at 750 nm from the folin ciocalteu reaction was measured by the spectrophotometer lambda ez 201 perkin elmer usa the total phenol content of the fruit was obtained from a calibration curve by measuring the adsorption of known concentrations of gallic acid and expressed as mg g dry weight velioglu et al 1998 2 3 3 fruit abscission at the fruit set stage 20 strands in four bunches and four sides of each tree were randomly selected and labeled the number of fruits in each bunch was counted and then from the stage of fruit set to harvest the percentage of fruit abscission in the date of sampling and in total fruit development stages were calculated alikhani koupaei et al 2018a 2 3 4 fruit precocity according to the four time harvest of dates mazafati at the rutab stage by the palm growers 10 strands from each bunch were labeled 12 days before harvest the cumulative number of their rutab was counted for each stage every four days until the harvesting stage and presented as percentages 2 3 5 portions of fruit carbohydrate fehling method a volumetric method was used to measure sugars the basis of this method is the reduction of cu 2 resulting from the combination of fehling s a and b solutions by the reducing sugars and converting it into cu 1 from february to august on each sampling date 20 fruit from each tree group were collected and after weighing 4 g of their mixture and transferring to a volume of 100 ml titration of fehling s solutions was carried out with the sugar solution until the formation of red brick deposit and in the presence of methylene blue in order to measure total sugars non reducing sugars were converted to the reducing sugars by using hydrochloric acid and finally the non reducing sugars were obtained from the total sugars minus the reducing sugars saini et al 2001 2 3 6 pattern of changes from starch accumulation in leaflets from the time of the first spathe emergence reproductive growth to the onset of reproductive growth in the following year and in different dates of the whole growth season random sampling was done from 20 middle leaflets belonging to the closed leaf to the bunch of each group of trees between clocks 8 10 am all samples were powdered with liquid nitrogen and stored in a 20 c freezer extraction of freeze dried samples was performed with perchloric acid 52 in the presence of anthrone reagent and the color intensity was measured by the spectrophotometer lambda ez 201 perkin elmer usa at 630 nm finally the starch content was calculated in mg g dry weight by the standard glucose curve hedge and hofreiter 1962 2 3 7 pattern of changes in activity of hydrolytic enzymes regarding three abscission waves the activity of cellulase and polygalacturonase pg enzymes in the fruit cap were monitored in different dates of fruit growth 2 3 7 1 enzyme extraction extraction buffer for these two enzymes was 100 mm sodium acetate buffer ph 0 5 containing 0 2 sodium dithionite and 1 polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp at 37 c for 5 h qaddoury and amssa 2003 2 3 7 2 monitoring of cellulase enzyme activity cellulase activity was determined by measuring the released reducing sugars from the carboxymethyl cellulose concentrations of reducing sugars were measured with d glucose concentrations as standard and absorbance at 550 nm the reaction mixture contained 0 25 ml of enzyme extract 0 5 ml of carboxymethylcellulose 0 1 and 0 25 ml of sodium acetate buffer of 100 mm ph 0 5 incubation was carried out at 37 c for 1 2 3 4 and 5 h and then dinitrosalicylic acid was added a cellulase activity unit is defined as an enzyme level that catalyzes the formation of 1 mmol h reducing sugars under standard conditions wood and bhat 1988 2 3 7 3 monitoring of polygalacturonase pg enzyme activity the pg enzyme activity was measured as the releasing water molecule from the reducing groups of polygalacturonic acid the reaction mixture 0 5 ml contained 1 polygalacturonic acid solution 0 05 m sodium acetate buffer ph 5 2 and 0 5 ml raw extract measurements were performed at 37 c for 1 h then 0 5 ml of reagent of dinitrosalicylic acid was added to each tube and heated in a boiling water bath for 10 min after cooling the temperature of the room absorbance was measured at 560 nm ben arie and sonego 1980 2 4 statistical analysis the experiment was carried out as a combined analysis across years based on randomized complete blocks with four replications considering three trees as a test plot comparison of the meanings after assuring that the data were normal based on the least significant difference test lsd at the probability level of 5 using jmp8 software sas institute cary nc according to the analysis of variance table in two ways 1 if the interaction effect of treatment year was significant in parametric measurement the comparison of the meanings was done separately for each year and 2 if the interaction of treatment year was not significant the mean of two years was compared the standard error in the figures was also represented as mean se 3 results and discussion 3 1 yield traits and biennial bearing index bbi considering the significant interaction between treatments year for yield bunch weight and fruit weight the mean comparison of these traits was done separately for each year the factors including fruit loading cutting back and rdi had a significant effect on yield fig 1 a bunch weight fig 1b bunch number fig 1c and fruit weight fig 1d at the fruit load of on2017 and off2017 trees in the year when the bunch number was low the bunch weight and the final yield also decreased but on the contrary the fruit weight increased the mean biennial percentage for the yield the bunch weight and the fruit weight percent listed in each column and the bunch number showed the continuation of alternate bearing in the group of on2017 and off2017 trees but the bunch weight fruit weight and the bunch number in the group of cutting back and rdi trees in 2017 and 2018 were on the side of the normal2017 tree group so that the mean biennial percentage of each of these traits moved toward equality and balance this decline in yield fluctuations which is in fact the result of production was achieved only in the rdi tree group that were statistically similar to the normal2017 tree group based on the biennial bearing index bbi the rdi tree group similar to the normal2017 tree group showed the least bbi in the two years of experiment fig 1e the ultimate goal of tree management is the practice to manipulate vegetative growth rate to reproductive growth and improving the quality of the produce by applying cutting back and rdi treatments requires the full knowledge of the fruit and vegetative growth pattern considering the cause of date alternate bearing due to fruit load so the fruit thinning of high yielding trees has led to increasing the weight and value of the fruit as well as flower induction in the next year and balancing the bunch number similar to the cutting back treatment in this research the fruit thinning of high yielding trees in two years by water spray for three minutes and up to 8 h after mechanical pollination especially in 4 h later in lulu date reduced total yield in the tamar stage but unlike this study also the bunch weight reduced awad 2006 the effect of the rdi on the yield and the fruit quality depends on the phonological stage of growth duration and severity of irrigation restriction and there is a significant difference between the species in khazravi cultivar dates soil moisture content in roots development area decreased to about 25 of available water but no significant decrease was observed in the leaf growth the yield and the fruit quality furr et al 1952 which the results were similar to the etc70 rdi treatment of this research it is argued that the bbi based on the fluctuation of the final yield cannot be a sufficient factor for calculating the alternate bearing and by some researchers the amount of flower production has been introduced as the modified alternate bearing index mabi because the conversion of vegetative buds to reproductive buds leads to the depletion of carbohydrate reserves khan et al 2014 sharma et al 2019 3 2 bunch length the recorded data for the bunch length is actually from the point of the strand emergence to the bunch head and does not include the stalk the results showed that in two years on all sampling dates except for the group of cutting back trees on the cutting date in the first year the largest and lowest bunch length belonged to the group of on2017 and off2017 trees with the difference that the ranking of these two tree groups cross moved in two years of experiment in 2017 the bunch lengths of three groups of normal2017 the cutting back and the rdi trees were placed between the group of on2017 and off2017 trees on all sampling dates and in late june the end of the bunch growth in 2017 the bunch length in these three groups of trees had less differences with each other fig 2 2017 in 2018 although the bunch lengths of these three tree groups were between the group of on2017 and off2017 trees during the bunch growth but in mid june the end of the bunch growth in 2018 the bunch length of normal2017 rdi and off2017 trees in 2018 according to production data the group of off2017 trees were in on condition had the lowest bunch lengths together and the group of cutting back and on2017 trees and owen in 2018 according to production data the group of on2017 trees were in off condition had the highest bunch length fig 2 2018 in date cultivars with the bunch length plus stalk more than 120 cm the cutting back is considered as the best fruit thinning method therefore this treatment was applied to fruit load control of mazafati date in this research on the other hand similar to the present study reducing the bunch length and the bunch falling from the proximal end of stalk v cut disorder was observed in medjool date by more intense rdi equivalent to 20 evaporation from class a pan during four months from december to mid april with irrigation intervals of 2 3 days cohen et al 2010 3 3 physical properties of fruits considering the significant insignificant interaction between treatments year the fruit length was compared to the mean of the tree groups in different years and the rest of the physical properties mentioned in table 3 were compared to the two year mean the weight ratio of flesh to seed fruit length in 2017 diameter and firmness in on2017 tree group decreased in harvest stage but this decrease was significant only for fruit firmness and fruit length increased significantly in on2017 tree group in 2018 on the other hand the applied treatments for fruit thinning as well as the off2017 tree group retained these traits and were statistically similar to the normal2017 tree group fruit peel showed the insignificant increase in the applied treatments for fruit thinning and the insignificant reduction in the off2017 tree group compared to the normal2017 tree group table 3 the use of fruit thinning treatments in on year can cause the reduction in number of fruit set reduction in competition between fruits in absorption of carbohydrates and hormones and thus increase the final size of fruits of course the severity of this effect depends on the species of fruit the amount of thinning and the climatic conditions of the area in this study the fruit thinning treatments maintained the final fruit size on2017 tree group in 2018 was in off state yield and reduced the bunch number and increased the weight and length of fruit were observed but the bunch weight reduced probably due to a decrease in the fruit number per bunch and was not affected by the decline in fruit competition thinning in large fruits where fruit size plays a crucial role in the market is more important but in small fruits it is only effective in fruit set small and round fruit cultivars such as lulu and barhee showed the least response to fruit thinning compared to large and oblong cultivars such as mazafati marashi et al 2012 the bunch architecture which is influenced by the fruit thinning method dictates the fruit quality at the harvest stage due to the bunch aeration for example removing the tip strand or removing the center strand of deglet nour date bunch is expected to lead to a difference in the fruit quality and perhaps one of the reasons for the difference of the fruit quality in fruit thinning treatments of this study is due to the bunch architecture nay and perring 2009 the fruit thinning treatments in this study preserved the physical traits of the whole fruit but the use of two years of the fruit thinning by water spray for three minutes and up to 8 h after mechanical pollination in lulu dates increased the weight of flesh and whole fruit and the diameter and length of the fruit only in the first year of application and did not affect the seed weight in any year awad 2006 water deficit stress influences the cell enlargement more than the cell division during fruit growth and development the cell enlargement can occur only when the osmotic pressure is greater than the cell wall pressure the stress threshold of water greatly blocks the cells and cell growth decreases due to low osmotic pressure shao et al 2008 fruit thinning can change the fruit firmness with a wide range of effects on the fruit size the number and size of the cell the volume of intercellular space the maturity in the harvest the amount of minerals and dry matter cell wall pectin and enzymatic activity on the other hand di reduces the fruit maturity thus it will affect the fruit quality so that the rigidity of the fruit increases and the smaller fruit is firm than the large fruit on the other hand di reduces the fruit maturity therefore it will affect the fruit quality including increasing the fruit firmness and the smaller fruit due to early maturation is firmer than the larger fruit water limitation also leads to decomposition of the cell wall polymers increasing lignin reducing the osmotic potential and finally increasing the fruit firmness garcia tejero et al 2010 but perhaps the amount of fruit thinning and irrigation restriction were rightly selected in this study which preserved the physical traits of the fruit such as the firmness similar to the results of this study di at the initial stage of fruit growth increased the ratio of peel thickness to fruit flesh in citrus garcia tejero et al 2010 it has also been reported that di in olive has increased the thickness of the fruit cuticle patumi et al 2002 3 4 chemical properties of fruits according to the results of the variance table the interaction of treatment year for all of the measured chemical traits was insignificant therefore only the comparison of the two year mean of these traits was presented in table 4 acid and total phenol content of fruit in the on tree group showed a significant reduction but the treatments used for fruit thinning and the off2017 tree group were similar to normal2017 trees for these two traits moisture content and tss of fruit reduced in the on2017 and the cutting back groups in the harvest stage but the off2017 and the rdi groups in terms of these two traits were similar to the normal2017 tree group and preserved them increasing the amount of brix due to fruit thinning has been reported as a result of an increase in the leaf to fruit ratio in the thinned trees compared to the control trees but such a change didn t observe in the present study similar to this study the fruit thinning in two years using water spray for 3 min and up to 8 h after mechanical pollination in lulu date did not affect the amount of fruit acid in different stages of fruit growth in any year and only increased the dry matter percentage of the fruit at the time of application 4 h after pollination in tamar stage awad 2006 deficit irrigation at the start of the season and increasing the water content due to dilution will reduce the tss but di at the stages of fruit growth leads to an increase in tss and tss to ta ratio total dry matter significantly increased in khalas date under sub optimal irrigation with irrigation interval once a week 7 days and tss pectin sucrose tannin and ph did not differ significantly between irrigation treatments irrigation interval of 1 7 days al yahyai and al kharusi 2012 however di at the beginning of the season in the present study did not change the chemical traits of the fruit at the rutab stage water stress causes a change in the concentration of nonstructural constituents of fruit by a direct effect on metabolism and an indirect effect on dilution mild osmotic stress may lead to reduced plant growth and increased secondary metabolite however as water stress increases stomatal adjustments occur and carbon dioxide stabilization decreases under this condition carbon should be allocated to the synthesis of primary metabolites for fruit growth which is detrimental to the synthesis of secondary metabolites such as carbon cycle based phenolic compounds intrigliolo and castel 2006 perhaps because the amount of rdi applied was less than the threshold tolerance of water stress to the trees so no changes in the phenolic compounds and fruit moisture content were observed 3 5 fruit abscission cumulative fruit abscission measured at two years during the fruit growing season the highest and lowest cumulative abscission at all sampling dates in 2017 were for the on2017 and off2017 trees fig 3 2017 respectively but the ranking of these two tree groups in this index cross moved in 2018 fig 3 2018 three waves of abscission abscission due to non fertilization first wave in march coinciding with late hababuk nutritional competition abscission second wave in may coinciding with mid kimri and pre harvest abscission due to fruit wilting caused by a sudden increase in temperature third wave in august observed in different tree groups during fruit growth cumulative abscission in the group of rdi trees similar to the normal2017 trees retained in 2017 at sampling dates and overall except for the abscission waves but the group of cutting back trees at the end of fruit growth were among the most abscission trees in 2018 the group of rdi trees added to the group of cutting back trees and were among the three groups of trees that had the highest cumulative rate of fruit abscission at all stages of fruit growth at the end of these two years the group of rdi trees was in the middle of the rest of the groups in terms of cumulative abscission studies show that the final regulation of the number of fruits in each tree is the result of an intrinsic mechanism that the fruits as a physiological sensor receive the degree of carbohydrate deficiency and regulate the fruit number by sending a message to stimulate ethylene production and abscission iglesias et al 2006 therefore the results shown in fig 3 can be interpreted on the basis of the same internal mechanism and due to the fact that fruit in different growth periods is the consumer and storage sink and the strongest carbohydrate absorption center however the removal of bunch center strand in may reduced the number of fruit per bunch and increased fruit size in four experimental gardens of deglet noor date in southern california but from june to harvest time didn t cause any change in the number of fruit and fruit abscission in the remaining strands nay and perring 2009 which was inconsistent with the results of this study moreover the two year fruit thinning by spraying water for 3 min at 4 h and 1 h before mechanical pollination in lulu date reduced fruit set on average 31 and 9 compared to control respectively awad 2006 the effect of di on flower and fruit abscission depends on the time of application the difference in fruit number is probably due to the response to di in the early stages of the reproductive cycle such as flower induction differentiation and fruit set and not in advanced stages of fruit growth kanety et al 2014 this response was also observed by rdi at the beginning of the season in this study 3 6 fruit precocity since the interaction effect of treatment per year was significant for each stage of cumulative percentage of rutab fruits so each year was compared separately as can be seen in fig 4 2017 and 2018 different treatments had an early or late effect of ripening in 2017 from 8 days before harvest whereas in 2018 this period increased to 12 days before harvest and the rankings of the off2017 and on2017 trees cross moved as fruit precocity in these two years as the group of trees in the off state was the earliest group in terms of precocity the cumulative percentage of rutab fruit in the cutting back and rdi treatments on the significant precocity days in both years was similar to the group of normal2017 trees mazafati dates in iran have four harvest stages and at each stage approximately ten percent of the fruits are at rotab stage and when the whole bunch is removed from the tree about 40 percent of the fruits are rutab in early cultivars fewer fruits are abscised due to the reduced effects of environmental and hormonal changes so precocity reduces the alternate bearing in the susceptible species due to reducing these environmental changes and abscission as well as an increase in carbohydrate and starch storage however late harvest results in a greater increase in fruit abscission during physiological abscission due to carbohydrate depletion by late ripening of the previous year mahouachi et al 2009 in citrus earlier harvest in the off year and later harvest in the on year cause the intensification of alternate bearing iglesias et al 2006 mahouachi et al 2009 also any method such as rdi applied to fruit thinning will cause precocity behboudian and mills 1997 it was reported that the extra irrigation on palm trees of maktum for 3 years resulted in more growth late ripening and larger fruit production while the damage caused by black tip and fruit wrinkling was high sharples and hilgeman 1951 3 7 portions of fruit carbohydrate the change pattern of fruit reducing sugars in all groups of trees was increasing in both years during fruit growth fig 5 2017 and 2018 except that ranking the lowest and highest fruit reducing sugars belonging to the off2017 and on2017 groups cross moved in two years of experiment this increase was statistically similar until the early kimri stage april in the different groups and the onset of differences in the reducing sugar levels was from the late kimri may to the harvest august so that in 2017 the reducing sugar levels of the normal2017 cutting back and rdi trees were between the off2017 and on2017 trees but in 2018 the reducing sugar content of normal2017 trees shifted to the on2017 trees the highest content and was statistically insignificant with this group also in 2018 the fruit reducing sugars of the cutting back and rdi trees tended toward the off2017 tree with the least amount the pattern of the non reducing sugars in fruit was also increasing during both years of the fruit growth fig 6 2017 and 2018 in both years changes in these sugars until the late kimri late may were statistically similar in normal2017 cutting back and rdi treatments but in 2017 after the late kimri until harvest august the change pattern of the non reducing sugars in these treatments was between the off2017 and on2017 trees and in 2018 in the same time period the non reducing sugars changes of the cutting back trees tended toward the off2017 trees the mutual shifting of the non reducing sugar content ranking observed in the off2017 and on2017 trees during two years of experiment so that in 2017 from the beginning of fruit growth to the late kimri late may the highest rate saw in the off2017 trees and immediately the mutual shift of the non reducing sugar content occurred in the off2017 and on2017 trees in 2018 at the beginning of fruit growth the highest amount belonged to the fruit of on2017 trees and the mutual shift of the non reducing sugar content in these trees with the off2017 trees happened a little earlier in early kimri early april the reason of the increasing sugar content is that after the fruit thinning a higher leaf area ratio is produced for the remaining fruits compared to the on treatment and the increase of photosynthetic production units increases the amount of carbohydrates gribaa et al 2013 zaid and de wet 1999 but physiological reasons for di treatments are that the application of di methods leads to a change in carbon allocation patterns improvement of the fruit growth compared to the vegetative growth and increasing water use efficiency behboudian and mills 1997 leib et al 2006 mpelasoka et al 2001 the ranking changes of reducing and non reducing sugars in different groups of trees in this study are also consistent with these physiological events of fruit thinning and di also the cross moving of rank between the off2017 and on2017 trees in terms of the reducing and non reducing sugars during the two years and the non reducing sugars after the late kimri in each year relates to the vegetative and reproductive growth competition for the production and storage of the sugars 3 8 pattern of changes from starch accumulation in leaflets both fruit thinning and fruit load had significant effect on leaf starch content fig 7 from the fruit set until the late kimi stage early june the pattern of leaf starch changes was decreasing then gradually increased until the harvest in august after harvest until mid december this increase occurred more rapidly in different treatments and after this stage in line with the flower induction in january the pattern was once again declining the results also indicated that the largest differences in starch content of the off2017 and on2017 trees were in mid may late kimmeri and early december early flowering induction fig 7 the significant difference seen at the end of the season between the levels of carbohydrate reserves of the off2017 and on2017 trees can be attributed to the continued pattern of increase in their storage in the on2017 trees and the beginning of their transfer to buds in the off2017 trees which will lead to high flowering next year leaflet starch concentration of the five tree groups was similar in the late kimri late may to early june the pattern of the leaflet starch changes in cutting back and rdi trees were statistically similar to the normal2017 trees throughout the year the leaflets of the off2017 trees showed the highest amount of starch at the beginning of 2017 until june 2 late kimri but after this date until harvest and finally continue to grow until december and january vegetative growth stages of plant these trees cross moved ranking their starch content with the leaflets of the on2017 trees and had the lowest amount of starch during this period moreover the pattern of all leaflet starch changes in different groups was in line with the reproductive period of the trees fruits are the strongest source for absorbing soluble sugars and unstructured carbohydrates and therefore carbohydrates are not stored in the organs of on trees so that fruit harvest time has a great effect on carbohydrate levels in all tree organs mpelasoka et al 2001 zaid and de wet 1999 the amount of soluble sugars in leaves of olive plants were similar under 60 etc and 100 etc irrigation conditions but leaf starch significantly reduced bacelar et al 2007 also in this study the rdi trees compared to the on2017 trees cross check showed the significant decrease of the leaflet starch from the late kimri to the flower induction next year this decrease may initially be related to osmotic tissue adjustments in fact after exposure to stress plants accumulate osmotic constituents including soluble sugars amino acids such as proline aspartic acid and glutamic acid ammonium compounds and hydrophilic proteins that one of the main sources of these osmolites are starch deposits secondly this decrease may be a response to lower levels of photosynthesis in fact the cultivars with low photosynthesis rate tend to synthesize soluble sugars for transferring sugars to growing organs and the reduction in starch can be due to it bacelar et al 2007 gribaa et al 2013 3 9 pattern of changes in the activity of hydrolytic enzymes of fruit calyx changes in the activity of cellulase and polygalacturonase enzymes in fruit calyx only evaluated in 2017 and the activity of these two enzymes increased during fruit growth fig 8 the data showed that the activity of these two enzymes in the calyx region had significantly different between different tree groups but their activity in each of the five groups was in good accordance with the pattern of flower and fruit abscission in addition during the period when there was no sign of severe abscission the activity of these enzymes was partially fluctuating the highest activity observed during the fruit growth stages as well as the sudden increase during the three waves of the fruit abscission in both enzymes of the fruit calyx of the on2017 trees the lowest activity of these two enzymes in the fruit calyx was in the normal2017 and off2017 trees during fruit growth but this difference was not statistically significant at most sampling dates the activity of these two enzymes in the fruit calyx of the cutting back and rdi trees was in the middle of the other treatments and it was noteworthy that during the three abscission waves the enzymes in these two tree groups are similar to the normal2017 and off2017 trees did not show the sudden increase of the activity the low abscission in the cutting back and rdi groups can be attributed to the control of flower and fruit production which will not leave much fruit to the abscission on the tree some growing fruits abscise because of competition for photosynthetic materials the amount of sucrose and the ratio of sucrose to hexose in growing fruits are important factors that stimulate the abscission under carbon deficiency conditions and increase the activity of hydrolytic enzymes iglesias et al 2006 stress caused by overloading the tree by disrupting the hormonal balance towards ethylene production and inducing ros production leads to increased activity of hydrolytic enzymes and damage to the antioxidant system effective degradation of ros requires concerted action of several antioxidant enzymes to achieve good results in stress resistance iwahori and oohata 1976 increasing auxin content in citrus calyx region decreased the fruit abscission and the cellulase enzyme activity of the fruit calyx in pre harvest goren and huberman 1976 4 conclusion the results of this study showed that the alternate bearing of date palm is related to the physiological factors including seasonal changes in the rate of internal carbohydrate metabolism and the decomposition and the formation of starch deposits in this study the changes in reducing sugars up to the maximum formation content 37 48 g 100 g fw per fruit at the harvest time and the maximum decomposition of the starch deposits in the late kimri with the residual content 15 70 mg g dw and the maximum starch formation during the flower induction with the content 230 300 mg g dw per leaflet recorded in order to monitor this disorder that caused different fruit loads in different years with the approximate ratio of 30 4 per year off to 70 7 per year on cutting back is a time consuming method with the high labor cost and difficult to use in older trees that are taller and more susceptible to alternate bearing the development of a safe and economical method of flower and fruit thinning is essential for controlling the growth fruit quality and tree yield of mazafati date in this study it is demonstrated that 70 of etc rdi the four month reduction in water intake with the content of 102 3 137 6 mm from approximately flower induction and the application in two consecutive years by controlling the 7 27 11 34 cm the growth rate of the bunch length in the on2017 trees is the good alternative for the cutting back of mazafati date trees the application of this treatment to the on2017 trees while adjusting 0 37 of bbi increased 18 9 of total yield during consecutive years and eliminated 6 85 11 72 of fruit abscission a new study is proposed to further investigate the reduction of water consumption as well as the change in the period length and the time of onset and termination of this treatment to control the alternate bearing of mazafati date moreover more reduction of water consumption requires an economic research take into account all costs including energy and water costs versus the benefits evaluation of quality and yield declaration of competing interest the authors would like to express that they have no competing interests regarding this research 
10679,the study of alternate bearing based on the seasonal changes pattern of tree carbohydrate is the unreviewed issue in the loading physiology of date phoenix dactylifera l trees on the other hand bunch cutting back is a crop improvement practice used in the date orchards and it is effective on flower induction and fruit set that regulates the quality and growth of fruit in the on year and the amount and yield of the produce in the off year research on an alternative thinning agent with the bunch cutting back is essential for dates in order to be economical and applicable in harsh climates for this purpose the experiment was conducted as a combined analysis across years based on randomized complete blocks on mazafati dates of 10 12 years old with different loading in 2017 off2017 normal2017 and on2017 as well as the on condition trees in 2017 plus bunch cutting back on2017 cutting back or regulated deficit irrigation on2017 rdi the main objectives of this study were to investigate the fragmentation of carbohydrate reserves of the tree in the annual rotation cycle in different loading to evaluate the relationship of sugar reserves with production and abscission of flowers and fruits to determine the effect of the rdi application in the on year on the pattern of sugar changes hydrolytic enzymes activity alternate bearing quantity and quality of the product and the possibility of replacing it with cutting back the results confirmed the significant effect of loading rate on the seasonal fragmentation and fluctuation of carbohydrates and the hydrolytic enzymes activity the results also showed that the rdi treatment due to the decrease of bunch length reduced the biennial bearing index bbi and improved the qualitative and quantitative traits of fruit better than the cutting back according to the results of this study the irrigation condition of trees has the potential to change the marketability and abscission of date fruits and this is a pioneer study of the rdi role as a thinning potential and moderating of date alternate bearing however further research is needed to justify the time and duration of this treatment application keywords fruit thinning biennial bearing index precocity carbohydrate abscission hydrolytic enzymes 1 introduction the alternate bearing means the production of a large number of small fruits in one year on year following the production of a small number of large fruit in the previous year sharma et al 2019 because of abscission off year in some fruit trees due to hormone or nutrition khan et al 2014 rosenstock et al 2010 which occurs in mazafati date phoenix dactylifera l trees because of nutritional imbalance between vegetative and reproductive organs pillay et al 2005 the palm trees have three waves of fruit abscission the first wave occurs a few weeks after pollination caused by the lack of fertilization and reduction of gibberellic acid produced by the seed nay and perring 2009 the second wave which is more serious is due to nutritional competition occurs in mid may at the end of the kimri and the beginning of the khalal stage and eventually the third wave occurs before harvesting due to the high temperature induced fruit wilting al qurashi et al 2012 othmani et al 2019 the alternate bearing is prevented by the old method of flowering and fruit thinning in on year which upgrades fruit dimensions reducing misshapen fruit and abscission by scattered fruits and bunch aeration lauri et al 2014 increasing maturity improving fruit coloring and controlling pests but sometimes this practice especially in wet areas increases the percentage of black nose fruits chao and krueger 2007 rosenstock et al 2010 fruit thinning in the dates is done using the following methods 1 bunch removal ratio of leaf bunch 10 dennis 2000 zaid and de wet 1999 2 bunch thinning cutting back remove the tip of the stalk removing strands hand thinning awad 2006 cohen et al 2010 3 chemical thinning 2 4 d ethephon and naa iwahori and oohata 1976 marashi et al 2012 the most appropriate method of date palm mazafati thinning is 5 cm cutting back ehsani 2007 deficit irrigation di means eliminating part of irrigation water that has no significant effect on yield shackel 2011 di under the influence of the time of application is called regulated deficit irrigation rdi which is the use of water in amounts less than the crop evapotranspiration etc in certain periods of the phonological stages of plant growth cuevas et al 2007 this method in contrast to the sustained deficit irrigation sdi focuses more on the crop physiology and is applied at times when the fruit growth is relatively slow and water stress will affect vegetative growth laribi et al 2013 the palm tree physiology shows that if the carbohydrate reserve is sufficient its flowering is carried out in january at 10 c chao and krueger 2007 at the development stage of the stalk february and march the fruit growth is slow and the water requirement is low but following the end of this stage late april a rapid increase in the growth and size of the fruit occurs when the water requirement increases and in the limitation of the water at this phenological stage will reduce the fruit growth and yield cohen et al 2010 gribaa et al 2013 decreasing vegetative growth reduces the competition for photosynthetic compounds between fruits and vegetative organs and thus increasing the size of fruits improves penetration of light into the crown and better fruit coloring faghih et al 2019 zhen et al 2019 di due to changes in the metabolism and the phloem supply produces high levels of secondary metabolites such as polyphenol compounds and antioxidants in fruits and increasing the organoleptic characteristics of fruits moreover di during the flowering lowers the fertilization and fruit set and the physiological thinning of immature fruits occurs in the first season khan and prathapar 2012 mpelasoka et al 2001 on the other hand di in some fruits causes prematurity behboudian and mills 1997 earlier maturation in these fruits can justify the no increase and even reduce the size of the fruit by di and theoretically treatments that change the size of the fruit change the quality firmness juice dilution soluble solids and fruit acids leib et al 2006 in case of any precocity and decrease in the size and quality of date fruit irrigation schedule of trees is one of the most important factors that should be carefully considered and for palm trees a history of di is reported at 65 75 etc in the developmental stage of the stalk alikhani koupaei et al 2018b gribaa et al 2013 all methods of fruit thinning require a lot of work and aren t cost effective therefore it is necessary to investigate other physiological methods gonzalez rossia et al 2006 in this regard the control of alternate bearing dates mazafati was studied using rdi and compared with the running method by the palm owners namely cutting back for two consecutive years 2 materials and methods 2 1 plant materials the present study was performed during two consecutive years of 2017 and 2018 on 10 12 years old mazafati date trees and 8 8 m spacing with a history of alternate bearing in nikshahr city southeast iran with the properties of climate soil and irrigation water provided in table 1 selected trees were pollinated with m003 genotype and subjected to uniform crop operation throughout the season under these conditions the emergence of the first spathes and cracking them were respectively february 4 and february 16 2017 and january 29 and february 6 2018 respectively and three waves fruit abscission in early march late may and early august occurred in both years harvesting of bunches was carried out about 190 200 days after pollination in both years and two bunches of trees in each treatment were harvested and the mean bunch weight was calculated on the other hand the yield of each tree was calculated from the mean weight of all bunch trees in each treatment the biennial bearing index was calculated according to the equation b i e n n i a l b e a r i n g i n d e x b b i 1 n 1 y 2 y 1 y 2 y 1 y 3 y 2 y 3 y 2 y n

treatment and tree groups this study was carried out over a period of two years on groups of selected trees so that replication of the experiment continued in the second year on the selected trees of the first year fruit thinning was carried out by 5 cm cutting back at the time of pollination ehsani 2007 the water requirement for the rdi treatment was calculated by allen et al equation etc eto kc in this equation etc and eto respectively the plant evapotranspiration and the reference evapotranspiration mm and kc is the crop coefficient based on the values provided for the date palm by fao allen et al 1998 flooding irrigation was carried out by the bubbler system with an average of 4 5 l min to the plots surrounding the palms by a volumetric counter the rdi treatment was adjusted to 70 etc for a period of four months from two months before bunching to two months later mid stage of the kimri with an irrigation interval of 100 mm cumulative evaporation from class a pan alikhani koupaei et al 2018b the four month weather conditions of the study area during the years of research are visible in table 1 before and after this period full irrigation with amount and intervals that are normal in the region 7 10 days in the warm months up to 21 27 days in cold months were carried out for this treatment as well as for the remaining treatments throughout the whole year the crop coefficient irrigation dates and water requirement of each tree during the four months and the whole year for rdi is listed in table 2 considering the ideal ratio of 10 leaves per bunch and 80 leaves for trees at the age of 10 12 years old zaid and de wet 1999 the trees that normally not using manual adjustment of bunch removal and in fact annual production based on the physiological history of each tree produce 10 8 and 6 bunches in 2017 were considered as on2017 year normal2017 bearing and off2017 year trees respectively for this experiment five groups of trees were considered 1 off year trees in 2017 off2017 2 normal bearing trees in 2017 normal2017 3 on years trees in 2017 on2017 cross check 4 on year trees in 2017 that were cutting back treated on2017 cutting back 5 on year trees in 2017 that were rdi treated on2017 rdi each tree group was considered as one treatment including four replicates and three trees in each replicate each group including 12 trees these trees were selected as randomized complete blocks in the studied orchard for two years of the experiment without changing the trees in the second year 2 3 sampling and evaluated traits 2 3 1 physical properties of fruits by random selection of 100 fruits in different directions of each tree at harvesting stage rutab length and diameter of the fruit and fruit peel thickness put seven fruit peel together and their mean in each measurement by digital caliper dc 209 mitutoyo co kanagawa japan and fruit weight by a digital scale with a precision of 0 01 bp2iid made in germany was calculated the penetrometer ta xt2 stable microsystems texture technologies inc uk with a 3 mm plunger was used to measure the firmness of both sides of the peeled fruit in the tropical area of the fruit 2 3 2 chemical properties of fruits at harvesting stage 20 fruits from each bunch in different directions of the tree were selected randomly and the chemical properties of the fruit were measured the moisture content of the fruit was calculated in terms of the difference of fresh weight with dry weight three days staining of samples in an oven at 70 c because of the high sugar content of the dates it is not possible to directly measure the total soluble solid tss so with a mixture of 9 g of flesh fruit after separating the peel with 45 ml of water and after an hour from the fruit juice extract tss were determined by a digital refractometer dr 6000 a krus optronic gmbh germany zokaee khosroshahi and esna ashari 2007 the titration method was used to determine the titratable acid content of fruit in terms of malic acid per 100 g of sample to measure total phenol 200 mg of dried fruit was extracted with 2 ml of 80 methanol the extract was centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 20 min and the absorbance of supernatant at 750 nm from the folin ciocalteu reaction was measured by the spectrophotometer lambda ez 201 perkin elmer usa the total phenol content of the fruit was obtained from a calibration curve by measuring the adsorption of known concentrations of gallic acid and expressed as mg g dry weight velioglu et al 1998 2 3 3 fruit abscission at the fruit set stage 20 strands in four bunches and four sides of each tree were randomly selected and labeled the number of fruits in each bunch was counted and then from the stage of fruit set to harvest the percentage of fruit abscission in the date of sampling and in total fruit development stages were calculated alikhani koupaei et al 2018a 2 3 4 fruit precocity according to the four time harvest of dates mazafati at the rutab stage by the palm growers 10 strands from each bunch were labeled 12 days before harvest the cumulative number of their rutab was counted for each stage every four days until the harvesting stage and presented as percentages 2 3 5 portions of fruit carbohydrate fehling method a volumetric method was used to measure sugars the basis of this method is the reduction of cu 2 resulting from the combination of fehling s a and b solutions by the reducing sugars and converting it into cu 1 from february to august on each sampling date 20 fruit from each tree group were collected and after weighing 4 g of their mixture and transferring to a volume of 100 ml titration of fehling s solutions was carried out with the sugar solution until the formation of red brick deposit and in the presence of methylene blue in order to measure total sugars non reducing sugars were converted to the reducing sugars by using hydrochloric acid and finally the non reducing sugars were obtained from the total sugars minus the reducing sugars saini et al 2001 2 3 6 pattern of changes from starch accumulation in leaflets from the time of the first spathe emergence reproductive growth to the onset of reproductive growth in the following year and in different dates of the whole growth season random sampling was done from 20 middle leaflets belonging to the closed leaf to the bunch of each group of trees between clocks 8 10 am all samples were powdered with liquid nitrogen and stored in a 20 c freezer extraction of freeze dried samples was performed with perchloric acid 52 in the presence of anthrone reagent and the color intensity was measured by the spectrophotometer lambda ez 201 perkin elmer usa at 630 nm finally the starch content was calculated in mg g dry weight by the standard glucose curve hedge and hofreiter 1962 2 3 7 pattern of changes in activity of hydrolytic enzymes regarding three abscission waves the activity of cellulase and polygalacturonase pg enzymes in the fruit cap were monitored in different dates of fruit growth 2 3 7 1 enzyme extraction extraction buffer for these two enzymes was 100 mm sodium acetate buffer ph 0 5 containing 0 2 sodium dithionite and 1 polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp at 37 c for 5 h qaddoury and amssa 2003 2 3 7 2 monitoring of cellulase enzyme activity cellulase activity was determined by measuring the released reducing sugars from the carboxymethyl cellulose concentrations of reducing sugars were measured with d glucose concentrations as standard and absorbance at 550 nm the reaction mixture contained 0 25 ml of enzyme extract 0 5 ml of carboxymethylcellulose 0 1 and 0 25 ml of sodium acetate buffer of 100 mm ph 0 5 incubation was carried out at 37 c for 1 2 3 4 and 5 h and then dinitrosalicylic acid was added a cellulase activity unit is defined as an enzyme level that catalyzes the formation of 1 mmol h reducing sugars under standard conditions wood and bhat 1988 2 3 7 3 monitoring of polygalacturonase pg enzyme activity the pg enzyme activity was measured as the releasing water molecule from the reducing groups of polygalacturonic acid the reaction mixture 0 5 ml contained 1 polygalacturonic acid solution 0 05 m sodium acetate buffer ph 5 2 and 0 5 ml raw extract measurements were performed at 37 c for 1 h then 0 5 ml of reagent of dinitrosalicylic acid was added to each tube and heated in a boiling water bath for 10 min after cooling the temperature of the room absorbance was measured at 560 nm ben arie and sonego 1980 2 4 statistical analysis the experiment was carried out as a combined analysis across years based on randomized complete blocks with four replications considering three trees as a test plot comparison of the meanings after assuring that the data were normal based on the least significant difference test lsd at the probability level of 5 using jmp8 software sas institute cary nc according to the analysis of variance table in two ways 1 if the interaction effect of treatment year was significant in parametric measurement the comparison of the meanings was done separately for each year and 2 if the interaction of treatment year was not significant the mean of two years was compared the standard error in the figures was also represented as mean se 3 results and discussion 3 1 yield traits and biennial bearing index bbi considering the significant interaction between treatments year for yield bunch weight and fruit weight the mean comparison of these traits was done separately for each year the factors including fruit loading cutting back and rdi had a significant effect on yield fig 1 a bunch weight fig 1b bunch number fig 1c and fruit weight fig 1d at the fruit load of on2017 and off2017 trees in the year when the bunch number was low the bunch weight and the final yield also decreased but on the contrary the fruit weight increased the mean biennial percentage for the yield the bunch weight and the fruit weight percent listed in each column and the bunch number showed the continuation of alternate bearing in the group of on2017 and off2017 trees but the bunch weight fruit weight and the bunch number in the group of cutting back and rdi trees in 2017 and 2018 were on the side of the normal2017 tree group so that the mean biennial percentage of each of these traits moved toward equality and balance this decline in yield fluctuations which is in fact the result of production was achieved only in the rdi tree group that were statistically similar to the normal2017 tree group based on the biennial bearing index bbi the rdi tree group similar to the normal2017 tree group showed the least bbi in the two years of experiment fig 1e the ultimate goal of tree management is the practice to manipulate vegetative growth rate to reproductive growth and improving the quality of the produce by applying cutting back and rdi treatments requires the full knowledge of the fruit and vegetative growth pattern considering the cause of date alternate bearing due to fruit load so the fruit thinning of high yielding trees has led to increasing the weight and value of the fruit as well as flower induction in the next year and balancing the bunch number similar to the cutting back treatment in this research the fruit thinning of high yielding trees in two years by water spray for three minutes and up to 8 h after mechanical pollination especially in 4 h later in lulu date reduced total yield in the tamar stage but unlike this study also the bunch weight reduced awad 2006 the effect of the rdi on the yield and the fruit quality depends on the phonological stage of growth duration and severity of irrigation restriction and there is a significant difference between the species in khazravi cultivar dates soil moisture content in roots development area decreased to about 25 of available water but no significant decrease was observed in the leaf growth the yield and the fruit quality furr et al 1952 which the results were similar to the etc70 rdi treatment of this research it is argued that the bbi based on the fluctuation of the final yield cannot be a sufficient factor for calculating the alternate bearing and by some researchers the amount of flower production has been introduced as the modified alternate bearing index mabi because the conversion of vegetative buds to reproductive buds leads to the depletion of carbohydrate reserves khan et al 2014 sharma et al 2019 3 2 bunch length the recorded data for the bunch length is actually from the point of the strand emergence to the bunch head and does not include the stalk the results showed that in two years on all sampling dates except for the group of cutting back trees on the cutting date in the first year the largest and lowest bunch length belonged to the group of on2017 and off2017 trees with the difference that the ranking of these two tree groups cross moved in two years of experiment in 2017 the bunch lengths of three groups of normal2017 the cutting back and the rdi trees were placed between the group of on2017 and off2017 trees on all sampling dates and in late june the end of the bunch growth in 2017 the bunch length in these three groups of trees had less differences with each other fig 2 2017 in 2018 although the bunch lengths of these three tree groups were between the group of on2017 and off2017 trees during the bunch growth but in mid june the end of the bunch growth in 2018 the bunch length of normal2017 rdi and off2017 trees in 2018 according to production data the group of off2017 trees were in on condition had the lowest bunch lengths together and the group of cutting back and on2017 trees and owen in 2018 according to production data the group of on2017 trees were in off condition had the highest bunch length fig 2 2018 in date cultivars with the bunch length plus stalk more than 120 cm the cutting back is considered as the best fruit thinning method therefore this treatment was applied to fruit load control of mazafati date in this research on the other hand similar to the present study reducing the bunch length and the bunch falling from the proximal end of stalk v cut disorder was observed in medjool date by more intense rdi equivalent to 20 evaporation from class a pan during four months from december to mid april with irrigation intervals of 2 3 days cohen et al 2010 3 3 physical properties of fruits considering the significant insignificant interaction between treatments year the fruit length was compared to the mean of the tree groups in different years and the rest of the physical properties mentioned in table 3 were compared to the two year mean the weight ratio of flesh to seed fruit length in 2017 diameter and firmness in on2017 tree group decreased in harvest stage but this decrease was significant only for fruit firmness and fruit length increased significantly in on2017 tree group in 2018 on the other hand the applied treatments for fruit thinning as well as the off2017 tree group retained these traits and were statistically similar to the normal2017 tree group fruit peel showed the insignificant increase in the applied treatments for fruit thinning and the insignificant reduction in the off2017 tree group compared to the normal2017 tree group table 3 the use of fruit thinning treatments in on year can cause the reduction in number of fruit set reduction in competition between fruits in absorption of carbohydrates and hormones and thus increase the final size of fruits of course the severity of this effect depends on the species of fruit the amount of thinning and the climatic conditions of the area in this study the fruit thinning treatments maintained the final fruit size on2017 tree group in 2018 was in off state yield and reduced the bunch number and increased the weight and length of fruit were observed but the bunch weight reduced probably due to a decrease in the fruit number per bunch and was not affected by the decline in fruit competition thinning in large fruits where fruit size plays a crucial role in the market is more important but in small fruits it is only effective in fruit set small and round fruit cultivars such as lulu and barhee showed the least response to fruit thinning compared to large and oblong cultivars such as mazafati marashi et al 2012 the bunch architecture which is influenced by the fruit thinning method dictates the fruit quality at the harvest stage due to the bunch aeration for example removing the tip strand or removing the center strand of deglet nour date bunch is expected to lead to a difference in the fruit quality and perhaps one of the reasons for the difference of the fruit quality in fruit thinning treatments of this study is due to the bunch architecture nay and perring 2009 the fruit thinning treatments in this study preserved the physical traits of the whole fruit but the use of two years of the fruit thinning by water spray for three minutes and up to 8 h after mechanical pollination in lulu dates increased the weight of flesh and whole fruit and the diameter and length of the fruit only in the first year of application and did not affect the seed weight in any year awad 2006 water deficit stress influences the cell enlargement more than the cell division during fruit growth and development the cell enlargement can occur only when the osmotic pressure is greater than the cell wall pressure the stress threshold of water greatly blocks the cells and cell growth decreases due to low osmotic pressure shao et al 2008 fruit thinning can change the fruit firmness with a wide range of effects on the fruit size the number and size of the cell the volume of intercellular space the maturity in the harvest the amount of minerals and dry matter cell wall pectin and enzymatic activity on the other hand di reduces the fruit maturity thus it will affect the fruit quality so that the rigidity of the fruit increases and the smaller fruit is firm than the large fruit on the other hand di reduces the fruit maturity therefore it will affect the fruit quality including increasing the fruit firmness and the smaller fruit due to early maturation is firmer than the larger fruit water limitation also leads to decomposition of the cell wall polymers increasing lignin reducing the osmotic potential and finally increasing the fruit firmness garcia tejero et al 2010 but perhaps the amount of fruit thinning and irrigation restriction were rightly selected in this study which preserved the physical traits of the fruit such as the firmness similar to the results of this study di at the initial stage of fruit growth increased the ratio of peel thickness to fruit flesh in citrus garcia tejero et al 2010 it has also been reported that di in olive has increased the thickness of the fruit cuticle patumi et al 2002 3 4 chemical properties of fruits according to the results of the variance table the interaction of treatment year for all of the measured chemical traits was insignificant therefore only the comparison of the two year mean of these traits was presented in table 4 acid and total phenol content of fruit in the on tree group showed a significant reduction but the treatments used for fruit thinning and the off2017 tree group were similar to normal2017 trees for these two traits moisture content and tss of fruit reduced in the on2017 and the cutting back groups in the harvest stage but the off2017 and the rdi groups in terms of these two traits were similar to the normal2017 tree group and preserved them increasing the amount of brix due to fruit thinning has been reported as a result of an increase in the leaf to fruit ratio in the thinned trees compared to the control trees but such a change didn t observe in the present study similar to this study the fruit thinning in two years using water spray for 3 min and up to 8 h after mechanical pollination in lulu date did not affect the amount of fruit acid in different stages of fruit growth in any year and only increased the dry matter percentage of the fruit at the time of application 4 h after pollination in tamar stage awad 2006 deficit irrigation at the start of the season and increasing the water content due to dilution will reduce the tss but di at the stages of fruit growth leads to an increase in tss and tss to ta ratio total dry matter significantly increased in khalas date under sub optimal irrigation with irrigation interval once a week 7 days and tss pectin sucrose tannin and ph did not differ significantly between irrigation treatments irrigation interval of 1 7 days al yahyai and al kharusi 2012 however di at the beginning of the season in the present study did not change the chemical traits of the fruit at the rutab stage water stress causes a change in the concentration of nonstructural constituents of fruit by a direct effect on metabolism and an indirect effect on dilution mild osmotic stress may lead to reduced plant growth and increased secondary metabolite however as water stress increases stomatal adjustments occur and carbon dioxide stabilization decreases under this condition carbon should be allocated to the synthesis of primary metabolites for fruit growth which is detrimental to the synthesis of secondary metabolites such as carbon cycle based phenolic compounds intrigliolo and castel 2006 perhaps because the amount of rdi applied was less than the threshold tolerance of water stress to the trees so no changes in the phenolic compounds and fruit moisture content were observed 3 5 fruit abscission cumulative fruit abscission measured at two years during the fruit growing season the highest and lowest cumulative abscission at all sampling dates in 2017 were for the on2017 and off2017 trees fig 3 2017 respectively but the ranking of these two tree groups in this index cross moved in 2018 fig 3 2018 three waves of abscission abscission due to non fertilization first wave in march coinciding with late hababuk nutritional competition abscission second wave in may coinciding with mid kimri and pre harvest abscission due to fruit wilting caused by a sudden increase in temperature third wave in august observed in different tree groups during fruit growth cumulative abscission in the group of rdi trees similar to the normal2017 trees retained in 2017 at sampling dates and overall except for the abscission waves but the group of cutting back trees at the end of fruit growth were among the most abscission trees in 2018 the group of rdi trees added to the group of cutting back trees and were among the three groups of trees that had the highest cumulative rate of fruit abscission at all stages of fruit growth at the end of these two years the group of rdi trees was in the middle of the rest of the groups in terms of cumulative abscission studies show that the final regulation of the number of fruits in each tree is the result of an intrinsic mechanism that the fruits as a physiological sensor receive the degree of carbohydrate deficiency and regulate the fruit number by sending a message to stimulate ethylene production and abscission iglesias et al 2006 therefore the results shown in fig 3 can be interpreted on the basis of the same internal mechanism and due to the fact that fruit in different growth periods is the consumer and storage sink and the strongest carbohydrate absorption center however the removal of bunch center strand in may reduced the number of fruit per bunch and increased fruit size in four experimental gardens of deglet noor date in southern california but from june to harvest time didn t cause any change in the number of fruit and fruit abscission in the remaining strands nay and perring 2009 which was inconsistent with the results of this study moreover the two year fruit thinning by spraying water for 3 min at 4 h and 1 h before mechanical pollination in lulu date reduced fruit set on average 31 and 9 compared to control respectively awad 2006 the effect of di on flower and fruit abscission depends on the time of application the difference in fruit number is probably due to the response to di in the early stages of the reproductive cycle such as flower induction differentiation and fruit set and not in advanced stages of fruit growth kanety et al 2014 this response was also observed by rdi at the beginning of the season in this study 3 6 fruit precocity since the interaction effect of treatment per year was significant for each stage of cumulative percentage of rutab fruits so each year was compared separately as can be seen in fig 4 2017 and 2018 different treatments had an early or late effect of ripening in 2017 from 8 days before harvest whereas in 2018 this period increased to 12 days before harvest and the rankings of the off2017 and on2017 trees cross moved as fruit precocity in these two years as the group of trees in the off state was the earliest group in terms of precocity the cumulative percentage of rutab fruit in the cutting back and rdi treatments on the significant precocity days in both years was similar to the group of normal2017 trees mazafati dates in iran have four harvest stages and at each stage approximately ten percent of the fruits are at rotab stage and when the whole bunch is removed from the tree about 40 percent of the fruits are rutab in early cultivars fewer fruits are abscised due to the reduced effects of environmental and hormonal changes so precocity reduces the alternate bearing in the susceptible species due to reducing these environmental changes and abscission as well as an increase in carbohydrate and starch storage however late harvest results in a greater increase in fruit abscission during physiological abscission due to carbohydrate depletion by late ripening of the previous year mahouachi et al 2009 in citrus earlier harvest in the off year and later harvest in the on year cause the intensification of alternate bearing iglesias et al 2006 mahouachi et al 2009 also any method such as rdi applied to fruit thinning will cause precocity behboudian and mills 1997 it was reported that the extra irrigation on palm trees of maktum for 3 years resulted in more growth late ripening and larger fruit production while the damage caused by black tip and fruit wrinkling was high sharples and hilgeman 1951 3 7 portions of fruit carbohydrate the change pattern of fruit reducing sugars in all groups of trees was increasing in both years during fruit growth fig 5 2017 and 2018 except that ranking the lowest and highest fruit reducing sugars belonging to the off2017 and on2017 groups cross moved in two years of experiment this increase was statistically similar until the early kimri stage april in the different groups and the onset of differences in the reducing sugar levels was from the late kimri may to the harvest august so that in 2017 the reducing sugar levels of the normal2017 cutting back and rdi trees were between the off2017 and on2017 trees but in 2018 the reducing sugar content of normal2017 trees shifted to the on2017 trees the highest content and was statistically insignificant with this group also in 2018 the fruit reducing sugars of the cutting back and rdi trees tended toward the off2017 tree with the least amount the pattern of the non reducing sugars in fruit was also increasing during both years of the fruit growth fig 6 2017 and 2018 in both years changes in these sugars until the late kimri late may were statistically similar in normal2017 cutting back and rdi treatments but in 2017 after the late kimri until harvest august the change pattern of the non reducing sugars in these treatments was between the off2017 and on2017 trees and in 2018 in the same time period the non reducing sugars changes of the cutting back trees tended toward the off2017 trees the mutual shifting of the non reducing sugar content ranking observed in the off2017 and on2017 trees during two years of experiment so that in 2017 from the beginning of fruit growth to the late kimri late may the highest rate saw in the off2017 trees and immediately the mutual shift of the non reducing sugar content occurred in the off2017 and on2017 trees in 2018 at the beginning of fruit growth the highest amount belonged to the fruit of on2017 trees and the mutual shift of the non reducing sugar content in these trees with the off2017 trees happened a little earlier in early kimri early april the reason of the increasing sugar content is that after the fruit thinning a higher leaf area ratio is produced for the remaining fruits compared to the on treatment and the increase of photosynthetic production units increases the amount of carbohydrates gribaa et al 2013 zaid and de wet 1999 but physiological reasons for di treatments are that the application of di methods leads to a change in carbon allocation patterns improvement of the fruit growth compared to the vegetative growth and increasing water use efficiency behboudian and mills 1997 leib et al 2006 mpelasoka et al 2001 the ranking changes of reducing and non reducing sugars in different groups of trees in this study are also consistent with these physiological events of fruit thinning and di also the cross moving of rank between the off2017 and on2017 trees in terms of the reducing and non reducing sugars during the two years and the non reducing sugars after the late kimri in each year relates to the vegetative and reproductive growth competition for the production and storage of the sugars 3 8 pattern of changes from starch accumulation in leaflets both fruit thinning and fruit load had significant effect on leaf starch content fig 7 from the fruit set until the late kimi stage early june the pattern of leaf starch changes was decreasing then gradually increased until the harvest in august after harvest until mid december this increase occurred more rapidly in different treatments and after this stage in line with the flower induction in january the pattern was once again declining the results also indicated that the largest differences in starch content of the off2017 and on2017 trees were in mid may late kimmeri and early december early flowering induction fig 7 the significant difference seen at the end of the season between the levels of carbohydrate reserves of the off2017 and on2017 trees can be attributed to the continued pattern of increase in their storage in the on2017 trees and the beginning of their transfer to buds in the off2017 trees which will lead to high flowering next year leaflet starch concentration of the five tree groups was similar in the late kimri late may to early june the pattern of the leaflet starch changes in cutting back and rdi trees were statistically similar to the normal2017 trees throughout the year the leaflets of the off2017 trees showed the highest amount of starch at the beginning of 2017 until june 2 late kimri but after this date until harvest and finally continue to grow until december and january vegetative growth stages of plant these trees cross moved ranking their starch content with the leaflets of the on2017 trees and had the lowest amount of starch during this period moreover the pattern of all leaflet starch changes in different groups was in line with the reproductive period of the trees fruits are the strongest source for absorbing soluble sugars and unstructured carbohydrates and therefore carbohydrates are not stored in the organs of on trees so that fruit harvest time has a great effect on carbohydrate levels in all tree organs mpelasoka et al 2001 zaid and de wet 1999 the amount of soluble sugars in leaves of olive plants were similar under 60 etc and 100 etc irrigation conditions but leaf starch significantly reduced bacelar et al 2007 also in this study the rdi trees compared to the on2017 trees cross check showed the significant decrease of the leaflet starch from the late kimri to the flower induction next year this decrease may initially be related to osmotic tissue adjustments in fact after exposure to stress plants accumulate osmotic constituents including soluble sugars amino acids such as proline aspartic acid and glutamic acid ammonium compounds and hydrophilic proteins that one of the main sources of these osmolites are starch deposits secondly this decrease may be a response to lower levels of photosynthesis in fact the cultivars with low photosynthesis rate tend to synthesize soluble sugars for transferring sugars to growing organs and the reduction in starch can be due to it bacelar et al 2007 gribaa et al 2013 3 9 pattern of changes in the activity of hydrolytic enzymes of fruit calyx changes in the activity of cellulase and polygalacturonase enzymes in fruit calyx only evaluated in 2017 and the activity of these two enzymes increased during fruit growth fig 8 the data showed that the activity of these two enzymes in the calyx region had significantly different between different tree groups but their activity in each of the five groups was in good accordance with the pattern of flower and fruit abscission in addition during the period when there was no sign of severe abscission the activity of these enzymes was partially fluctuating the highest activity observed during the fruit growth stages as well as the sudden increase during the three waves of the fruit abscission in both enzymes of the fruit calyx of the on2017 trees the lowest activity of these two enzymes in the fruit calyx was in the normal2017 and off2017 trees during fruit growth but this difference was not statistically significant at most sampling dates the activity of these two enzymes in the fruit calyx of the cutting back and rdi trees was in the middle of the other treatments and it was noteworthy that during the three abscission waves the enzymes in these two tree groups are similar to the normal2017 and off2017 trees did not show the sudden increase of the activity the low abscission in the cutting back and rdi groups can be attributed to the control of flower and fruit production which will not leave much fruit to the abscission on the tree some growing fruits abscise because of competition for photosynthetic materials the amount of sucrose and the ratio of sucrose to hexose in growing fruits are important factors that stimulate the abscission under carbon deficiency conditions and increase the activity of hydrolytic enzymes iglesias et al 2006 stress caused by overloading the tree by disrupting the hormonal balance towards ethylene production and inducing ros production leads to increased activity of hydrolytic enzymes and damage to the antioxidant system effective degradation of ros requires concerted action of several antioxidant enzymes to achieve good results in stress resistance iwahori and oohata 1976 increasing auxin content in citrus calyx region decreased the fruit abscission and the cellulase enzyme activity of the fruit calyx in pre harvest goren and huberman 1976 4 conclusion the results of this study showed that the alternate bearing of date palm is related to the physiological factors including seasonal changes in the rate of internal carbohydrate metabolism and the decomposition and the formation of starch deposits in this study the changes in reducing sugars up to the maximum formation content 37 48 g 100 g fw per fruit at the harvest time and the maximum decomposition of the starch deposits in the late kimri with the residual content 15 70 mg g dw and the maximum starch formation during the flower induction with the content 230 300 mg g dw per leaflet recorded in order to monitor this disorder that caused different fruit loads in different years with the approximate ratio of 30 4 per year off to 70 7 per year on cutting back is a time consuming method with the high labor cost and difficult to use in older trees that are taller and more susceptible to alternate bearing the development of a safe and economical method of flower and fruit thinning is essential for controlling the growth fruit quality and tree yield of mazafati date in this study it is demonstrated that 70 of etc rdi the four month reduction in water intake with the content of 102 3 137 6 mm from approximately flower induction and the application in two consecutive years by controlling the 7 27 11 34 cm the growth rate of the bunch length in the on2017 trees is the good alternative for the cutting back of mazafati date trees the application of this treatment to the on2017 trees while adjusting 0 37 of bbi increased 18 9 of total yield during consecutive years and eliminated 6 85 11 72 of fruit abscission a new study is proposed to further investigate the reduction of water consumption as well as the change in the period length and the time of onset and termination of this treatment to control the alternate bearing of mazafati date moreover more reduction of water consumption requires an economic research take into account all costs including energy and water costs versus the benefits evaluation of quality and yield declaration of competing interest the authors would like to express that they have no competing interests regarding this research
