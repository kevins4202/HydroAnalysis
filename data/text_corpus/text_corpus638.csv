3190,in view of the amphiphilicity of surfactants which can improve the hydrophilicity of polyethylene pe microplastics and increase the mobility of pe microplastics the research on the transport behavior of pe microplastics under the coexistence of surfactants is still lacking and necessary in this work column experiments were carried out on the suspensions made of 15 surfactants mixed and dispersed with pe microplastics to explore the promoting effect of various surfactants on the transport of pe in saturated porous media the dynamic contact angle of surfactant on pe surface and the surface tension and zeta potential of pe surfactant dispersion system were measured the interaction energy between pe surfactant and medium the adhesion of surfactant on pe surface were calculated respectively according to dlvo theory and young s equation the experimental results showed that different surfactants promoted the transportation of pe in the column to different degrees the promotion

column ranged from 17 to 99 93 under the surfactants the calculation results of the adhesion of surfactant on pe surface also showed the same law the minimum single molecule adsorption area asl of surfactant on pe surface was negatively correlated with the recovery of pe in the column under the same type of surfactant the high adhesion of surfactant on pe surface was caused by the small adsorption area of single molecule which finally made pe obtain higher stability and penetration these findings provide new insights and methods for the fate and transport of microplastic and surfactant coexisting systems in soil and the prediction of their potential risk of groundwater pollution keywords different types of surfactants polyethylene transport adhesion asl data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction plastic pollution has attracted more and more attention in recent years due to the increase of plastic production and consumption rillig et al 2017 plastic waste has chemical stability corrosion resistance and difficult biodegradation it may exist for hundreds to thousands of years resulting in continuous accumulation in the environment hu et al 2019 under the conditions of sunlight weathering erosion and immersion large pieces of plastic will be decomposed into small particles auta et al 2017 they are defined as microplastics when the particle size of plastic species is less than 5 mm and microplastics can be further decomposed into nano plastics in the natural environment chae and an 2018 hu et al 2019 microplastics is more likely to affect its surrounding environment compared with large size plastic wang et al 2019 so far microplastics have been detected in the ocean air soil surface water and even groundwater auta et al 2017 forero lopez et al 2021 kumar et al 2021a kumar et al 2021b li et al 2021 pe plastic is one of the most widely used plastics in the world jung et al 2021 considering the long term existence of pe microplastic in the environment pe microplastic and its pollution impact seem to be inevitable once microplastics enter the groundwater environment microplastics with large specific surface area and hydrophobicity may adsorb certain pollutants thereby changing the transport and deposition of other pollutants increasing the environmental risk of microplastics zhou et al 2022 therefore the transport and deposition of plastic particles in porous media have attracted great attention recently he et al 2020 the existing research mainly focuses on polystyrene due to the good hydrophilicity and controllable size range zhou et al 2022 a number of studies have shown that the transport of polystyrene ps in porous media will be affected by the particle size wang et al 2022 the particle size of media shaniv et al 2021 the conditions of chemical solution xi et al 2022 clay minerals lu et al 2021 iron containing compounds tong et al 2020 and biofilm he et al 2020 in media in addition a few studies have investigated the transport behavior of polyethylene terephthalate pet microplastics in porous media and found that the mobility of pet microplastics increases with increasing ph media size water content and humic acid concentration pe is the largest kind of plastics in production and use but very limited research has focused on the polyethylene transport in porous media because of their strong hydrophobicity and low density hou et al 2020 surfactants are widely used in emulsifiers detergents and dispersants their molecules are composed of non polar hydrophobic parts and polar hydrophilic parts which enable them to be adsorbed at the surface kurrey et al 2019 surfactants inevitably enter all parts of the environment due to human activities kurrey et al 2019 existing studies have confirmed that different types of surfactants can be detected in natural waters and industrial wastewater rosal et al 2010 these surfactants commonly found in the environment in contact with micro plastics may affect their transport and fate studies have shown that surfactants promote the dispersion of plastic sheets and reduce the floatability through adsorption wang et al 2015 the surface hydrophobicity of microplastics is conducive to the combination with the hydrophobic chain of surfactant molecules so as to obtain hydrophilicity of microplastics jiang et al 2021 jiang et al 2021 studied the effects of anionic surfactant sdbs and cationic surfactant ctab on the transport of pe and pp in saturated porous media the report pointed out that the transport of pp and pe can be well promoted by two surfactants the reason why the collision between microplastics and quartz sand is weakened is that the osmotic and elastic repulsion generated by ctab is much greater than that of sdbs which makes the transport of microplastics in ctab very strong although sdbs and ctab are commonly used surfactants they are also representative substances of anionic and cationic surfactants respectively kaczerewska et al 2020 zhu et al 2022 there are many classifications of surfactants hundreds of different surfactants are included in the same type and their structures and properties are different ji et al 2021 this not only means that different types of surfactants have different effects on the transport of microplastics in porous media but also the hydrophilic modification ability of different surfactants on microplastics under the same type in conclusion it is necessary to further study the transport behavior of microplastics in saturated porous media under the action of different surfactants based on the above problems taking pe microplastics particles as the research object the transport behavior under fifteen surfactants was performed the surfactants are divided into three types five cationic surfactants benzyldodecyldimethylammoniumbromide bg polyquaternium 28 pq28 hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide ctab benzyltriethylammonium bromide blb

follows 1 to explore the effects of different types of surfactants on the transport of pe microplastics particles in saturated porous media 2 to clarify the differences in the effects of cationic anionic and nonionic surfactants on the transport of pe microplastics 3 to reveal the relationship between the minimum single molecule adsorption area of surfactants and the transport of pe microplastics 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the pe microplastics used in this experiment were purchased from china united plastics co ltd co ltd and the pe microplastics were not uniform in size and shape shown in fig s1 the five cationic surfactants bg pq28 ctab blb tlb five anionic surfactants sds slded dss sl sdbs and five non ionic surfactants poes t40 t80 x100 tx20 involved in the experiment were purchased from shanghai aladdin and mclean reagent company respectively the relevant information of reagents was shown in table s1 quartz sand 10 20 mesh as column filling media was purchased from zhouzhi quartz sand factory zhouzhi shaanxi the quartz sand was washed with 0 1 m naoh and hcl to remove surface impurities before the experiment the 300 mg pe microplastic powder was added to 1 l surfactant solution of 300 mg l 1 then the pe microplastic powder and surfactant solution were mixed and stirred for 5 min and then dispersed for 30 min with an ultrasonic cleaning machine kq 500de kunshan ultrasonic instrument company china to ensure uniform suspension surfactant solution was prepared by using a background electrolyte solution ph 6 5 is 0 001 m kcl the concentrations of microplastics and surfactants in the stock solution were both 300 mg l 1 the choice of microplastics and surfactants concentration was based on our previous research to better demonstrate the migration mechanism of different microplastics under the influence of surfactants and their retention behavior in porous media jiang et al 2021 the zeta plus analyzer zetasizer nano zs90 malvern instruments uk was used to measure the zeta potential and quartz sand in solutions with different surfactants and the particle size of pe microplastics was analyzed by zeta plus analyzer the particle size range of pe microplastic under different surfactants was approximately 1 6 um 2 2 um the surface tension of surfactant aqueous solutions was measured by surface tensiometer dcat21 dataphysics instruments germany the hanging sheet method was used and the temperature was controlled at 25 0 0 2 the dynamic contact angle of surfactant aqueous solution on pe surface was measured by video based optical contact angle measuring device oca 200 dataphysics instruments germany the results of surface tension and dynamic contact angle were shown in fig s2 and fig s3 respectively 2 2 column experiments transport experiments were conducted in columns 10 cm height and 1 5 cm inner diameter packed with quartz sand the sand was wet packed with distilled water using a glass stirring rod to minimize any layering and remove air entrapment in the column and the saturated sand column had a pore volume of 6 ml sun et al 2010 according to the ratio of pore volume to column volume the porosity of the packed column was 0 35 up flow direction is selected as the flow direction because packed columns are traditionally saturated using up flow to reduce air entrapment chrysikopoulos and syngouna 2014 the column was initially flushed with ultrapure water for 2 h until the effluent was clear and free of impurities the sand column was washed with corresponding surfactant solution instead of distilled water for 2 h to balance the experimental conditions in the column after that the mixed suspension 10pvs of different surfactants and pe microplastics was pumped into the sand column at a flow rate of 2 0 ml min 1 then the mixed suspension was replaced with surfactant solution again to wash the sand column until the concentration of pe microplastics in the effluent is zero all column experiments samples were taken every 10 ml from the beginning of pe microplastic suspension using an automatic fraction collector ebs 20 shanghai huxi analytical instrument china the pe concentration was determined by measuring the light attenuation au at a wavelength of 350 nm via turbidimetry yin et al 2010 the light attenuation method based on sample turbidity was listed as a standard method for determining the concentration of suspended particles in natural water body in u s techniques of water resources investigations anderson 2005 the absorbance of sdbs and ctab at 350 nm was zero the hydraulic characteristics and dispersion coefficient of quartz sand column under the same transport conditions were measured with nano3 as tracer all column experiments were performed in parallel in duplicate 2 3 mathematical model and calculation equation the extended derjaguin landau verwey overbeek xdlvo theory was used to explain the transport and deposition behavior of microplastics adsorbing surfactants in porous media under various experimental conditions the xdlvo energy etot was established as the sum of the energy of five interactions namely van der waals

are provided in supplementary data s1 the advection dispersion equation ade was used to simulate colloids transport in the sand columns the governing equations can be written as follows jiang et al 2021 1 c w t d 2 c w z 2 v c w z ρ θ s t 2 ρ θ s t k 1 s s m a x c w where c w is the colloid concentration in the pore water mg l 1 reflecting the magnitude of the equilibrium reaction in the sand

maximum deposited particle concentration this model was applied to simulate the experimental breakthrough curves the parameters k and s max were established using hydrus 1d the adhesion work of surfactant on the micro plastic surface was calculated by young dupre equation chaudhuri and paria 2009 which described the relationship between solid gas solid liquid liquid gas interfacial tension and contact angle generally the difference between solid gas and solid liquid interfacial tension was defined as the adhesion tension of surfactant on the solid surface which reflects the adhesion ability between solid and liquid szymczyk et al 2014 the adhesion work was closely related to the minimum area occupied by each surfactant molecule on the surface of the pe microplastic other details are provided in supplementary data s2 s3 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of anionic and nonionic surfactant on pe transport the breakthrough curves of the co transport of five anionic surfactants sds slded dss sl and sdbs and pe particles are shown in the fig 1 a the recovery of pe is 99 93 sds 81 60 slded 71 84 dss 62 87 sl and 42 18 sdbs from high to low under the five anionic surfactants as shown in fig s4 pe microplastics are extremely difficult to migrate in the medium because of insoluble in water and float on the surface this means that all five anionic surfactants promote the transport of pe in the sand column even if the promotion results are different this is because as a hydrophobic material pe microplastics can easily combine with the hydrophobic chains of surfactant molecules through hydrophobic interaction thereby improving the hydrophilicity of microplastics lu et al 2014 it is shown in table 1 that the zeta potentials of pe sds pe slded pe dss pe sl and pe sdbs dispersions are 33 26 31 00 27 66 26 04 and 26 60 mv respectively it is found that the order of zeta potential is consistent with the transportation capacity of pe microplastics in the sand column however the interaction energy between pe microplastics and quartz sand under the anionic surfactants calculated according to dlvo theory shown in fig 2 a indicates that pe has high mobility in quartz sand because the energy barrier value is much greater than 15 kt wang et al 2022 the retention of pe microplastics in porous media will not have a large difference which is demonstrated by the small energy barrier difference it is observed that the transport ability of pe microplastics under sl and sdbs is weaker than that of the other three anionic surfactants the above experimental results cannot be explained by dlvo theory which shows that the transport behavior of pe in porous media is also affected by non dlvo forces in the presence of surfactants carstens et al 2019 when using the dlvo theory to calculate the interaction force between the pe and the surface of the medium the pe and the surfactant molecules adsorbed on the pe surface are calculated as a charged colloid however surfactant molecules and pe cannot form a stable combination because they are held together through weak interaction hydrophobic force wang et al 2021 the surface of the microplastics is not charged or very weak and has strong hydrophobicity therefore once the anionic surfactant is separated from the surface of the microplastic the stability of the microplastics in the solution will be reduced and the transport ability will also be inhibited previous studies have shown that the change in the degree of hydrophilicity of the surfactant to the solid surface is related to the adhesion work of the surfactant molecule at the interface downer et al 1999 dramé et al 2013 this is because the different molecular structures of surfactants make the adsorption morphology of surfactant molecules at the interface different which leads to differences in adhesion work downer et al 1999 dramé et al 2013 the adhesion work of five anionic surfactants on the surface of pe microplastics is shown in the table 1 the order is sds slded dss sl sdbs and its values are124 44 75 02 64 33 59 04 and 27 26 kt respectively this implies that sds can produce the greatest degree of hydrophilicity to pe microplastics which enables pe to obtain high stability and ultimately leads to the highest recovery rate of pe in the sds pe system in addition the order of adhesion work of sds slded dss sl and sdbs on the surface of pe microplastics is consistent with the transport ability of pe in this experiment the adhesion work reflects the adhesion ability of surfactant molecules on the surface of pe microplastics chaudhuri and paria 2009 since surfactant molecules and microplastics are not a stable combination if the reaction force of the electrostatic effect generated during the approach of the pe microplastic is greater than the adhesion of the surfactant molecules on the surface of the microplastic it will inevitably lead to the detachment of the surfactant molecules thereby reducing the stability of the pe microplastic according to the formula in supplementary information s3 the electrostatic interaction energy between pe microplastics in the presence of sds slded dss sl and sdbs is greater than the adhesion work when the distance is 12 18 20 22 and 24 nm respectively this distance is defined as instability distance dis which indicates that the distance between pe microplastics is smaller than dis the surfactant will tend to separate from the surface of the microplastics for example sds molecules in pe sds system will fall off only when the distance between pe is less than 12 nm but for sl and sdbs they have already detached from the pe surface at 12 nm because the instability distance is much larger than that of sds the schematic diagram is shown in fig 3 if the instability distance is also regarded as the effective radius of pe microplastics it means that the collision probability of pe microplastics under sl and sdbs is much greater than sds resulting in great differences in the transport capacity of pe microplastics in porous media under different anionic surfactants in addition the distance between pe microplastics is greater than the instability distance the surfactant can adhere to the surface of pe microplastics without separation because the adhesion work is greater than electrostatic effect in this case the combination of surfactant and pe microplastics can be regarded as a whole in other words the transport behavior of pe microplastics beyond the instability distance conforms to dlvo theory thus the larger the zeta potential on the surface of pe microplastics the stronger is the transport capacity he et al 2019 the breakthrough curve of pe microplastics in the presence of anionic surfactants is fitted using the ade model the results are in good agreement with our experimental data indicating that the transport of microplastics in porous media has colloidal characteristics jiang et al 2021 the best fit values for the fitting parameters i e k and smax and r2 are shown in table 1 the best smax and k values of the microplastics follows the order of pe sds pe slded pe dss pe sl pe sdbs the change trends of the smax and k values are also consistent with the experimental results there are a lot of charges on the microplastic surface due to the existence of ionic surfactants the degree of detachment of surfactant molecules from the solid surface is affected by the electrostatic interaction between microplastics therefore the difference in the ability of surfactant molecules to promote pe transport is largely caused by the interaction of electrostatic force and adhesion work in order to further confirm the connection between the interaction of electrostatic force and adhesion work the effects of five non ionic surfactants on the transport of pe were also investigated as shown in the fig 1b similarly the five nonionic surfactants have greatly promoted the transport of pe in porous media the recovery rate is greater than 60 table 1 the mobility of pe in the column follows the order of poes t40 t80 x100 tx20 nonionic surfactants also bind to the surface of pe microplastics through hydrophobic interaction but different from the above two types of surfactants the surface of pe has almost no charge table 1 using the dlvo interaction energy also cannot explain the impact of five nonionic surfactants on the transport of pe microplastics fig 2b the adhesion work of five nonionic surfactants on pe surface follows the order of poes 68 97 kt t40 37 05 kt t80 31 29 kt x100 29 04 kt tx20 27 56 kt the instability distances are 11 16 18 19 and 21 nm respectively this implies that the adhesion work of five nonionic surfactants on pe surface calculated are still important factors affecting the stability of pe microplastics particles in water comparing anionic surfactants and nonionic surfactants it can be found that when the adhesion work of anionic and nonionic surfactants on the pe surface is close the instability distance is nonionic surfactants anionic surfactants for example tx20 sdbs this is because the nonionic surfactant on the pe surface basically does not contain electric charge and the electrostatic interaction between the pe microplastics is weak and only when they are closer to each other can the electrostatic interaction exceed the adhesion work therefore the instability distance of the nonionic surfactant on the surface of the pe is smaller which makes the migration ability of the pe microplastic in the nonionic surfactant tx20 stronger than that of the anionic surfactant sdbs 3 2 effect of cationic surfactant on pe transport fig 1c compares the breakthrough curves of pe microplastic in the presence of five cationic surfactants bg pq28 ctab blb tlb the mobility of pe in the sand column from high to low is bg pq28 ctab blb tlb anionic surfactants and cationic surfactants have similar effects on pe it can be combined with pe microplastics through a hydrophobic effect and the hydrophilic end points to the water phase to make the surface of the particles positively charged which increases the hydrophilicity of the microplastics and promotes the migration of pe in the porous media jiang et al 2021 shen et al 2021 it is shown in table 1 that the recovery rates of pe sds pe slded pe dss pe sl and pe sdbs are 95 06 91 26 87 15 23 17 and 17 00 respectively the zeta potentials of pe bg pe pq28 pe ctab pe blb and pe tlb are 45 41 41 10 38 74 27 01 and 23 22 mv respectively the dlvo interaction energy shown in fig 2c exhibits that the difference in dlvo energy is small this indicates that the migration ability of pe microplastics in porous media under different cationic surfactants will not show a large difference wang et al 2022 therefore the reason for the difference in the mobility of pe under cationic surfactants is still that the adhesion work of the five cationic surfactants on the pe surface is different the adhesion work of bg pq28 ctab blb and tlb on the pe surface are 83 30 66 78 62 86 15 33 and 12 78 kt respectively table 1 calculating the electrostatic interaction energy between microplastics in dlvo theory the adhesion work of bg pq28 ctab blb and tlb on the pe surface is less than the electrostatic effect when the distance is 22 24 25 33 and 34 nm respectively the influence factors of cationic surfactants and anionic surfactants on promoting the migration of pe microplastics can be attributed to the adhesion function of surfactant molecules on the surface of microplastics however even if the distance between cationic surfactants and anionic surfactants or nonionic surfactants on the pe surface is close the migration ability of pe microplastics under anionic surfactants is weaker than that of cationic surfactants previous studies have shown that the transport of pe and pp microplastics in saturated porous media can be promoted by anionic surfactant and cationic surfactant and the promotion effect of ctab on the transport of the two microplastics is better than that of sdbs and the reason is attributed to the fact that the surface of quartz sand is covered with double layer ctab molecules and sdbs cannot be adsorbed on the surface of quartz sand due to electrostatic repulsion therefore the osmotic and elastic repulsion generated by ctab is much greater than that of sdbs which makes ctab play a strong role in promoting the transportation of microplastic particles jiang et al 2021 martines et al 2008 sun et al 2015 the xdlvo interaction energy calculated based on the osmotic and elastic repulsion shown in fig s3 confirms that the interaction energy between pe microplastics and quartz sand in the presence of anionic surfactants is much smaller than cationic surfactants the adhesion work of dss and ctab on the pe surface is close but the transport of pe microplastics shows a difference which indicates that the osmotic and elastic repulsion between microplastics and quartz sand will play a leading role when the adhesion tension is almost the same however based on the experimental results in this study it is known that not all cationic surfactants have a greater effect on pe microplastics transport than anionic surfactants for example the xdlvo interaction energy of cationic surfactants teba and tb are both greater than the anionic surfactants used in this experiment but they are less effective in promoting the transportation of pe microplastics although the osmotic and elastic repulsion produced by teba and tb may be greater than sds the effect on the stability of microplastics relative to the adhesion tension is not important it indicates that the adhesion work of the surfactant on the surface of the microplastic has a decisive effect on the migration behavior of the microplastic furthermore the breakthrough curve of pe microplastics in the presence of cationic surfactants can be well fitted by the ade model 3 3 promoting effect of surfactant on pe transport in saturated media in this study the transport behavior of pe microplastics in quartz sand columns is affected by the adhesion work of surfactant molecules on the surface of microplastics that is under the same type of surfactant the larger is the adhesion work of the surfactant the stronger is the migration ability of pe microplastics studies have shown that the adhesion work of surfactant on solid surface is mainly affected by the structure of surfactant and the properties of solid surface downer et al 1999 dramé et al 2013 the surfactant structure affects its minimum single molecule adsorption area asl on the pe surface thereby controlling the adhesion work of the surfactant on the microplastic surface according to the formula in supplementary information s2 the minimum areas of bg pq28 ctab blb and tlb cationic surfactant on pe surface are calculated as 0 63 0 71 0 74 2 85 and 3 07 nm2 respectively the minimum areas of sds slded dss sl and sdbs anionic surfactant on pe surface are 0 45 0 68 0 76 0 81 and 0 94 nm2 respectively and poes t40 t80 x100 and tx20 were 0 76 1 36 1 55 1 66 and 1 68 nm2 respectively shown in table 1 it can be found that the shorter the carbon chain the more heterochains and benzene rings the larger is the single molecule adsorption area of the surfactant which makes the adhesion work of the surfactant on the microplastic surface smaller in order to quantitatively understand the relationship between the area occupied by different surfactants same type and the transport capacity of pe microplastics the correlation analysis between the area occupied by different types of surfactants and the recovery rate of pe microplastics is carried out from fig 4 it can be found that that there is a significant negative correlation between the single molecule adsorption area of different surfactant and the transport capacity of microplastics r2 greater than 0 95 as mentioned above the surfactant has a smaller area at the pe microplastic interface which is more conducive to forming a stable surfactant polyethylene microplastic combination the area occupied by the single molecule of the anionic surfactant sds is much smaller than that of the cationic surfactants teba and tb which results in that the adhesion work of sds molecules on the pe surface is much greater than that of teba and tb molecules therefore the fundamental reason for the promotion effect of the same type of surfactant on the migration of pe microplastics is the molecular structure of surfactants surfactant molecules have short carbon chains and fewer heterochains the smaller the adsorption area on the solid surface and the greater the adhesion work which makes the microplastic particles more stable in the aqueous solution and ultimately leads to better promotion of the migration of the microplastics for example the sds in an anionic surfactant is a long linear chain containing twelve carbon atoms compared with other surfactants in the experiment the adsorption area on the pe surface is the smallest and the adhesion work is the largest even if the osmotic and elastic repulsion are less than cationic surfactants and the electrostatic effect is greater than that of nonionic surfactants the migration ability of pe microplastics under sds is also extremely strong on the contrary the tlb in cationic surfactants have short carbon chains but many heterochains resulting in the large space occupied by the tlb molecules on the surface of the microplastics even if it has higher the osmotic and elastic repulsion than anionic surfactants its adhesion work is small the distance between the surfactant molecules has not yet caused the osmotic and elastic repulsion to be generated and the electrostatic effect has been greater than the adhesion work then the tlb molecules will break away the surface of the microplastics resulting in the lowest outflow of pe in pe tlb system the results indicate clearly that the main factor controlling the microplastics transport by surfactant molecules is the adhesion work of the surfactant at the interface the structural difference makes the adsorption area of the surfactant molecules on the surface of the microplastics behave differently which affects the adhesion work produced by the surfactants and then manifests is the ability of the surfactant molecules to detach from the surface of the microplastics 4 conclusions the effects of 5 anionic 5 cationic and 5 nonionic surfactants on the transport of pe microplastics in saturated porous media were studied the results show that these 15 surfactants can increase the transport of pe in the column by improving the hydrophilicity of pe and the promotion effects are different the adhesion work of the surfactant on the pe surface has a good positive correlation with the recovery of pe the hydrophilicity of pe is determined by the adhesion work and electrostatic effect of surfactant on the surface of microplastics in the actual pe transportation process the electrostatic effect between particles is greater than the adhesion work when the distance between microplastics is less than the instability distance which forces the surfactants to separate from the pe surface because they are not a stable combination the smaller instability distance calculated according to the equation means lower collision probability and higher stability between pe furthermore the hydrophilicity of pe obtained from the surfactant adsorbed on the surface is highly related to the minimum single molecule adsorption area of the surfactant itself on the microplastics surface this conclusion is confirmed by the experiment of the effect of nonionic surfactants without charge on the transport of pe in saturated porous media the area occupied by the surfactant molecules on the surface of the microplastics is small and the adhesion work is large which ultimately makes the microplastics have strong mobility based on the uniqueness of surfactants and microplastics this study provides a theoretical basis for qualitative analysis of the risks of these two pollutants in the

et al 2019 under the conditions of sunlight weathering erosion and immersion large pieces of plastic will be decomposed into small particles auta et al 2017 they are defined as microplastics when the particle size of plastic species is less than 5 mm and microplastics can be further decomposed into nano plastics in the natural environment chae and an 2018 hu et al 2019 microplastics is more likely

forero lopez et al 2021 kumar et al 2021a kumar et al 2021b li et al 2021 pe plastic is one of the most widely used plastics in the world jung et al 2021 considering the long term existence of pe microplastic in the environment pe microplastic and its pollution impact seem to be inevitable once microplastics enter the groundwater environment microplastics with large specific surface area and hydrophobicity may adsorb certain pollutants thereby changing the transport and deposition of other pollutants increasing the environmental risk of microplastics zhou et al 2022 therefore the transport and deposition of plastic particles in porous media have attracted great attention recently he et al 2020 the existing research mainly focuses on polystyrene due to the good hydrophilicity and controllable size range zhou et al 2022 a number of studies have shown that the transport of polystyrene ps in porous media will be affected by the particle size wang et al 2022 the particle size of media shaniv et al 2021 the conditions of chemical solution xi et al 2022 clay minerals lu et al 2021 iron containing compounds tong et al 2020 and biofilm he et al 2020 in media in addition a few studies have investigated the transport behavior of polyethylene terephthalate pet microplastics in porous media and found that the mobility of pet microplastics increases with increasing ph media size water content and humic acid concentration pe is the largest kind of plastics in production and use but very limited research has focused on the polyethylene transport in porous media because of their strong hydrophobicity and low density hou et al 2020 surfactants are widely used in emulsifiers detergents and dispersants their molecules are composed of non polar hydrophobic parts and polar hydrophilic parts which enable them to be adsorbed at the surface kurrey et al 2019 surfactants inevitably enter all parts of the environment due to human activities kurrey et al 2019 existing studies have confirmed that different types of surfactants can be detected in natural waters and industrial wastewater rosal et al 2010 these surfactants commonly found in the environment in contact with micro plastics may affect their transport and fate studies have shown that surfactants promote the dispersion of plastic sheets and reduce the floatability through adsorption wang et al 2015 the surface hydrophobicity of microplastics is conducive to the combination with the hydrophobic chain of surfactant molecules so as to obtain hydrophilicity of microplastics jiang et al 2021 jiang et al 2021 studied the effects of anionic surfactant sdbs and cationic surfactant ctab on the transport of pe and pp in saturated porous media the report pointed out that the transport of pp and pe can be well promoted by two surfactants the reason why the collision between microplastics and quartz sand is weakened is that the osmotic and elastic repulsion generated by ctab is much greater than that of sdbs which makes the transport of microplastics in ctab very strong although sdbs and ctab are commonly used surfactants they are also representative substances of anionic and cationic surfactants respectively kaczerewska et al 2020 zhu et al 2022 there are many classifications of surfactants hundreds of different surfactants are included in the same type and their structures and properties are different ji et al 2021 this not only means that different types of surfactants have different effects on the transport of microplastics in porous media but also the hydrophilic modification ability of different surfactants on microplastics under the same type in conclusion it is necessary to further study the transport behavior of microplastics in saturated porous media under the action of different surfactants based on the above problems taking pe microplastics particles as the research object the transport behavior under fifteen surfactants was performed the surfactants are divided into three types five cationic surfactants benzyldodecyldimethylammoniumbromide bg polyquaternium 28 pq28 hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide ctab benzyltriethylammonium bromide blb

follows 1 to explore the effects of different types of surfactants on the transport of pe microplastics particles in saturated porous media 2 to clarify the differences in the effects of cationic anionic and nonionic surfactants on the transport of pe microplastics 3 to reveal the relationship between the minimum single molecule adsorption area of surfactants and the transport of pe microplastics 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the pe microplastics used in this experiment were purchased from china united plastics co ltd co ltd and the pe microplastics were not uniform in size and shape shown in fig s1 the five cationic surfactants bg pq28 ctab blb tlb five anionic surfactants sds slded dss sl sdbs and five non ionic surfactants poes t40 t80 x100 tx20 involved in the experiment were purchased from shanghai aladdin and mclean reagent company respectively the relevant information of reagents was shown in table s1 quartz sand 10 20 mesh as column filling media was purchased from zhouzhi quartz sand factory zhouzhi shaanxi the quartz sand was washed with 0 1 m naoh and hcl to remove surface impurities before the experiment the 300 mg pe microplastic powder was added to 1 l surfactant solution of 300 mg l 1 then the pe microplastic powder and surfactant solution were mixed and stirred for 5 min and then dispersed for 30 min with an ultrasonic cleaning machine kq 500de kunshan ultrasonic instrument company china to ensure uniform suspension surfactant solution was prepared by using a background electrolyte solution ph 6 5 is 0 001 m kcl the concentrations of microplastics and surfactants in the stock solution were both 300 mg l 1 the choice of microplastics and surfactants concentration was based on our previous research to better demonstrate the migration mechanism of different microplastics under the influence of surfactants and their retention behavior in porous media jiang et al 2021 the zeta plus analyzer zetasizer nano zs90 malvern instruments uk was used to measure the zeta potential and quartz sand in solutions with different surfactants and the particle size of pe microplastics was analyzed by zeta plus analyzer the particle size range of pe microplastic under different surfactants was approximately 1 6 um 2 2 um the surface tension of surfactant aqueous solutions was measured by surface tensiometer dcat21 dataphysics instruments germany the hanging sheet method was used and the temperature was controlled at 25 0 0 2 the dynamic contact angle of surfactant aqueous solution on pe surface was measured by video based optical contact angle measuring device oca 200 dataphysics instruments germany the results of surface tension and dynamic contact angle were shown in fig s2 and fig s3 respectively 2 2 column experiments transport experiments were conducted in columns 10 cm height and 1 5 cm inner diameter packed with quartz sand the sand was wet packed with distilled water using a glass stirring rod to minimize any layering and remove air entrapment in the column and the saturated sand column had a pore volume of 6 ml sun et al 2010 according to the ratio of pore volume to column volume the porosity of the packed column was 0 35 up flow direction is selected as the flow direction because packed columns are traditionally saturated using up flow to reduce air entrapment chrysikopoulos and syngouna 2014 the column was initially flushed with ultrapure water for 2 h until the effluent was clear and free of impurities the sand column was washed with corresponding surfactant solution instead of distilled water for 2 h to balance the experimental conditions in the column after that the mixed suspension 10pvs of different surfactants and pe microplastics was pumped into the sand column at a flow rate of 2 0 ml min 1 then the mixed suspension was replaced with surfactant solution again to wash the sand column until the concentration of pe microplastics in the effluent is zero all column experiments samples were taken every 10 ml from the beginning of pe microplastic suspension using an automatic fraction collector ebs 20 shanghai huxi analytical instrument china the pe concentration was determined by measuring the light attenuation au at a wavelength of 350 nm via turbidimetry yin et al 2010 the light attenuation method based on sample turbidity was listed as a standard method for determining the concentration of suspended particles in natural water body in u s techniques of water resources investigations anderson 2005 the absorbance of sdbs and ctab at 350 nm was zero the hydraulic characteristics and dispersion coefficient of quartz sand column under the same transport conditions were measured with nano3 as tracer all column experiments were performed in parallel in duplicate 2 3 mathematical model and calculation equation the extended derjaguin landau verwey overbeek xdlvo theory was used to explain the transport and deposition behavior of microplastics adsorbing surfactants in porous media under various experimental conditions the xdlvo energy etot was established as the sum of the energy of five interactions namely van der waals

are provided in supplementary data s1 the advection dispersion equation ade was used to simulate colloids transport in the sand columns the governing equations can be written as follows jiang et al 2021 1 c w t d 2 c w z 2 v c w z ρ θ s t 2 ρ θ s t k 1 s s m a x c w where c w is the colloid concentration in the pore water mg l 1 reflecting the magnitude of the equilibrium reaction in the sand column d is the dispersion coefficient cm2 min 1 v is the flow rate cm min 1 ρ is the media bulk density g cm 3 θ is the porosity k is the first order retention coefficient min 1 and s max is the maximum deposited particle concentration this model was applied to simulate the experimental breakthrough curves the parameters k and s max were established using hydrus 1d the adhesion work of surfactant on the micro plastic surface was calculated by young dupre equation chaudhuri and paria 2009 which described the relationship between solid gas solid liquid liquid gas interfacial tension and contact angle generally the difference between solid gas and solid liquid interfacial tension was defined as the adhesion tension of surfactant on the solid surface which reflects the adhesion ability between solid and liquid szymczyk et al 2014 the adhesion work was closely related to the minimum area occupied by each surfactant molecule on the surface of the pe microplastic other details are provided in supplementary data s2 s3 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of anionic and nonionic surfactant on pe transport the breakthrough curves of the co transport of five anionic surfactants sds slded dss sl and sdbs and pe particles are shown in the fig 1 a the recovery of pe is 99 93 sds 81 60 slded 71 84 dss 62 87 sl and 42 18 sdbs from high to low under the five anionic surfactants as shown in fig s4 pe microplastics are extremely difficult to migrate in the medium because of insoluble in water and float on the surface this means that all five anionic surfactants promote the transport of pe in the sand column even if the promotion results are different this is because as a hydrophobic material pe microplastics can easily combine with the hydrophobic chains of surfactant molecules through hydrophobic interaction thereby improving the hydrophilicity of microplastics lu et al 2014 it is shown in table 1 that the zeta potentials of pe sds pe slded pe dss pe sl and pe sdbs dispersions are 33 26 31 00 27 66 26 04 and 26 60 mv respectively it is found that the order of zeta potential is consistent with the transportation capacity of pe microplastics in the sand column however the interaction energy between pe microplastics and quartz sand under the anionic surfactants calculated according to dlvo theory shown in fig 2 a indicates that pe has high mobility in quartz sand because the energy barrier value is much greater than 15 kt wang et al 2022 the retention of pe microplastics in porous media will not have a large difference which is demonstrated by the small energy barrier difference it is observed that the transport ability of pe microplastics under sl and sdbs is weaker than that of the other three anionic surfactants the above experimental results cannot be explained by dlvo theory which shows that the transport behavior of pe in porous media is also affected by non dlvo forces in the presence of surfactants carstens et al 2019 when using the dlvo theory to calculate the interaction force between the pe and the surface of the medium the pe and the surfactant molecules adsorbed on the pe surface are calculated as a charged colloid however surfactant molecules and pe cannot form a stable combination because they are held together through weak interaction hydrophobic force wang et al 2021 the surface of the microplastics is not charged or very weak and has strong hydrophobicity therefore once the anionic surfactant is separated from the surface of the microplastic the stability of the microplastics in the solution will be reduced and the transport ability will also be inhibited previous studies have shown that the change in the degree of hydrophilicity of the surfactant to the solid surface is related to the adhesion work of the surfactant molecule at the interface downer et al 1999 dramé et al 2013 this is because the different molecular structures of surfactants make the adsorption morphology of surfactant molecules at the interface different which leads to differences in adhesion work downer et al 1999 dramé et al 2013 the adhesion work of five anionic surfactants on the surface of pe microplastics is shown in the table 1 the order is sds slded dss sl sdbs and its values are124 44 75 02 64 33 59 04 and 27 26 kt respectively this implies that sds can produce the greatest degree of hydrophilicity to pe microplastics which enables pe to obtain high stability and ultimately leads to the highest recovery rate of pe in the sds pe system in addition the order of adhesion work of sds slded dss sl and sdbs on the surface of pe microplastics is consistent with the transport ability of pe in this experiment the adhesion work reflects the adhesion ability of surfactant molecules on the surface of pe microplastics chaudhuri and paria 2009 since surfactant molecules and microplastics are not a stable combination if the reaction force of the electrostatic effect generated during the approach of the pe microplastic is greater than the adhesion of the surfactant molecules on the surface of the microplastic it will inevitably lead to the detachment of the surfactant molecules thereby reducing the stability of the pe microplastic according to the formula in supplementary information s3 the electrostatic interaction energy between pe microplastics in the presence of sds slded dss sl and sdbs is greater than the adhesion work when the distance is 12 18 20 22 and 24 nm respectively this distance is defined as instability distance dis which indicates that the distance between pe microplastics is smaller than dis the surfactant will tend to separate from the surface of the microplastics for example sds molecules in pe sds system will fall off only when the distance between pe is less than 12 nm but for sl and sdbs they have already detached from the pe surface at 12 nm because the instability distance is much larger than that of sds the schematic diagram is shown in fig 3 if the instability distance is also regarded as the effective radius of pe microplastics it means that the collision probability of pe microplastics under sl and sdbs is much greater than sds resulting in great differences in the transport capacity of pe microplastics in porous media under different anionic surfactants in addition the distance between pe microplastics is greater than the instability distance the surfactant can adhere to the surface of pe microplastics without separation because the adhesion work is greater than electrostatic effect in this case the combination of surfactant and pe microplastics can be regarded as a whole in other words the transport behavior of pe microplastics beyond the instability distance conforms to dlvo theory thus the larger the zeta potential on the surface of pe microplastics the stronger is the transport capacity he et al 2019 the breakthrough curve of pe microplastics in the presence of anionic surfactants is fitted using the ade model the results are in good agreement with our experimental data indicating that the transport of microplastics in porous media has colloidal characteristics jiang et al 2021 the best fit values for the fitting parameters i e k and smax and r2 are shown in table 1 the best smax and k values of the microplastics follows the order of pe sds pe slded pe dss pe sl pe sdbs the change trends of the smax and k values are also consistent with the experimental results there are a lot of charges on the microplastic surface due to the existence of ionic surfactants the degree of detachment of surfactant molecules from the solid surface is affected by the electrostatic interaction between microplastics therefore the difference in the ability of surfactant molecules to promote pe transport is largely caused by the interaction of electrostatic force and adhesion work in order to further confirm the connection between the interaction of electrostatic force and adhesion work the effects of five non ionic surfactants on the transport of pe were also investigated as shown in the fig 1b similarly the five nonionic surfactants have greatly promoted the transport of pe in porous media the recovery rate is greater than 60 table 1 the mobility of pe in the column follows the order of poes t40 t80 x100 tx20 nonionic surfactants also bind to the surface of pe microplastics through hydrophobic interaction but different from the above two types of surfactants the surface of pe has almost no charge table 1 using the dlvo interaction energy also cannot explain the impact of five nonionic surfactants on the transport of pe microplastics fig 2b the adhesion work of five nonionic surfactants on pe surface follows the order of poes 68 97 kt t40 37 05 kt t80 31 29 kt x100 29 04 kt tx20 27 56 kt the instability distances are 11 16 18 19 and 21 nm respectively this implies that the adhesion work of five nonionic surfactants on pe surface calculated are still important factors affecting the stability of pe microplastics particles in water comparing anionic surfactants and nonionic surfactants it can be found that when the adhesion work of anionic and nonionic surfactants on the pe surface is close the instability distance is nonionic surfactants anionic surfactants for example tx20 sdbs this is because the nonionic surfactant on the pe surface basically does not contain electric charge and the electrostatic interaction between the pe microplastics is weak and only when they are closer to each other can the electrostatic interaction exceed the adhesion work therefore the instability distance of the nonionic surfactant on the surface of the pe is smaller which makes the migration ability of the pe microplastic in the nonionic surfactant tx20 stronger than that of the anionic surfactant sdbs 3 2 effect of cationic surfactant on pe transport fig 1c compares the breakthrough curves of pe microplastic in the presence of five cationic surfactants bg pq28 ctab blb tlb the mobility of pe in the sand column from high to low is bg pq28 ctab blb tlb anionic surfactants and cationic surfactants have similar effects on pe it can be combined with pe microplastics through a hydrophobic effect and the hydrophilic end points to the water phase to make the surface of the particles positively charged which increases the hydrophilicity of the microplastics and promotes the migration of pe in the porous media jiang et al 2021 shen et al 2021 it is shown in table 1 that the recovery rates of pe sds pe slded pe dss pe sl and pe sdbs are 95 06 91 26 87 15 23 17 and 17 00 respectively the zeta potentials of pe bg pe pq28 pe ctab pe blb and pe tlb are 45 41 41 10 38 74 27 01 and 23 22 mv respectively the dlvo interaction energy shown in fig 2c exhibits that the difference in dlvo energy is small this indicates that the migration ability of pe microplastics in porous media under different cationic surfactants will not show a large difference wang et al 2022 therefore the reason for the difference in the mobility of pe under cationic surfactants is still that the adhesion work of the five cationic surfactants on the pe surface is different the adhesion work of bg pq28 ctab blb and tlb on the pe surface are 83 30 66 78 62 86 15 33 and 12 78 kt respectively table 1 calculating the electrostatic interaction energy between microplastics in dlvo theory the adhesion work of bg pq28 ctab blb and tlb on the pe surface is less than the electrostatic effect when the distance is 22 24 25 33 and 34 nm respectively the influence factors of cationic surfactants and anionic surfactants on promoting the migration of pe microplastics can be attributed to the adhesion function of surfactant molecules on the surface of microplastics however even if the distance between cationic surfactants and anionic surfactants or nonionic surfactants on the pe surface is close the migration ability of pe microplastics under anionic surfactants is weaker than that of cationic surfactants previous studies have shown that the transport of pe and pp microplastics in saturated porous media can be promoted by anionic surfactant and cationic surfactant and the promotion effect of ctab on the transport of the two microplastics is better than that of sdbs and the reason is attributed to the fact that the surface of quartz sand is covered with double layer ctab molecules and sdbs cannot be adsorbed on the surface of quartz sand due to electrostatic repulsion therefore the osmotic and elastic repulsion generated by ctab is much greater than that of sdbs which makes ctab play a strong role in promoting the transportation of microplastic particles jiang et al 2021 martines et al 2008 sun et al 2015 the xdlvo interaction energy calculated based on the osmotic and elastic repulsion shown in fig s3 confirms that the interaction energy between pe microplastics and quartz sand in the presence of anionic surfactants is much smaller than cationic surfactants the adhesion work of dss and ctab on the pe surface is close but the transport of pe microplastics shows a difference which indicates that the osmotic and elastic repulsion between microplastics and quartz sand will play a leading role when the adhesion tension is almost the same however based on the experimental results in this study it is known that not all cationic surfactants have a greater effect on pe microplastics transport than anionic surfactants for example the xdlvo interaction energy of cationic surfactants teba and tb are both greater than the anionic surfactants used in this experiment but they are less effective in promoting the transportation of pe microplastics although the osmotic and elastic repulsion produced by teba and tb may be greater than sds the effect on the stability of microplastics relative to the adhesion tension is not important it indicates that the adhesion work of the surfactant on the surface of the microplastic has a decisive effect on the migration behavior of the microplastic furthermore the breakthrough curve of pe microplastics in the presence of cationic surfactants can be well fitted by the ade model 3 3 promoting effect of surfactant on pe transport in saturated media in this study the transport behavior of pe microplastics in quartz sand columns is affected by the adhesion work of surfactant molecules on the surface of microplastics that is under the same type of surfactant the larger is the adhesion work of the surfactant the stronger is the migration ability of pe microplastics studies have shown that the adhesion work of surfactant on solid surface is mainly affected by the structure of surfactant and the properties of solid surface downer et al 1999 dramé et al 2013 the surfactant structure affects its minimum single molecule adsorption area asl on the pe surface thereby controlling the adhesion work of the surfactant on the microplastic surface according to the formula in supplementary information s2 the minimum areas of bg pq28 ctab blb and tlb cationic surfactant on pe surface are calculated as 0 63 0 71 0 74 2 85 and 3 07 nm2 respectively the minimum areas of sds slded dss sl and sdbs anionic surfactant on pe surface are 0 45 0 68 0 76 0 81 and 0 94 nm2 respectively and poes t40 t80 x100 and tx20 were 0 76 1 36 1 55 1 66 and 1 68 nm2 respectively shown in table 1 it can be found that the shorter the carbon chain the more heterochains and benzene rings the larger is the single molecule adsorption area of the surfactant which makes the adhesion work of the surfactant on the microplastic surface smaller in order to quantitatively understand the relationship between the area occupied by different surfactants same type and the transport capacity of pe microplastics the correlation analysis between the area occupied by different types of surfactants and the recovery rate of pe microplastics is carried out from fig 4 it can be found that that there is a significant negative correlation between the single molecule adsorption area of different surfactant and the transport capacity of microplastics r2 greater than 0 95 as mentioned above the surfactant has a smaller area at the pe microplastic interface which is more conducive to forming a stable surfactant polyethylene microplastic combination the area occupied by the single molecule of the anionic surfactant sds is much smaller than that of the cationic surfactants teba and tb which results in that the adhesion work of sds molecules on the pe surface is much greater than that of teba and tb molecules therefore the fundamental reason for the promotion effect of the same type of surfactant on the migration of pe microplastics is the molecular structure of surfactants surfactant molecules have short carbon chains and fewer heterochains the smaller the adsorption area on the solid surface and the greater the adhesion work which makes the microplastic particles more stable in the aqueous solution and ultimately leads to better promotion of the migration of the microplastics for example the sds in an anionic surfactant is a long linear chain containing twelve carbon atoms compared with other surfactants in the experiment the adsorption area on the pe surface is the smallest and the adhesion work is the largest even if the osmotic and elastic repulsion are less than cationic surfactants and the electrostatic effect is greater than that of nonionic surfactants the migration ability of pe microplastics under sds is also extremely strong on the contrary the tlb in cationic surfactants have short carbon chains but many heterochains resulting in the large space occupied by the tlb molecules on the surface of the microplastics even if it has higher the osmotic and elastic repulsion than anionic surfactants its adhesion work is small the distance between the surfactant molecules has not yet caused the osmotic and elastic repulsion to be generated and the electrostatic effect has been greater than the adhesion work then the tlb molecules will break away the surface of the microplastics resulting in the lowest outflow of pe in pe tlb system the results indicate clearly that the main factor controlling the microplastics transport by surfactant molecules is the adhesion work of the surfactant at the interface the structural difference makes the adsorption area of the surfactant molecules on the surface of the microplastics behave differently which affects the adhesion work produced by the surfactants and then manifests is the ability of the surfactant molecules to detach from the surface of the microplastics 4 conclusions the effects of 5 anionic 5 cationic and 5 nonionic surfactants on the transport of pe microplastics in saturated porous media were studied the results show that these 15 surfactants can increase the transport of pe in the column by improving the hydrophilicity of pe and the promotion effects are different the adhesion work of the surfactant on the pe surface has a good positive correlation with the recovery of pe the hydrophilicity of pe is determined by the adhesion work and electrostatic effect of surfactant on the surface of microplastics in the actual pe transportation process the electrostatic effect between particles is greater than the adhesion work when the distance between microplastics is less than the instability distance which forces the surfactants to separate from the pe surface because they are not a stable combination the smaller instability distance calculated according to the equation means lower collision probability and higher stability between pe furthermore the hydrophilicity of pe obtained from the surfactant adsorbed on the surface is highly related to the minimum single molecule adsorption area of the surfactant itself on the microplastics surface this conclusion is confirmed by the experiment of the effect of nonionic surfactants without charge on the transport of pe in saturated porous media the area occupied by the surfactant molecules on the surface of the microplastics is small and the adhesion work is large which ultimately makes the microplastics have strong mobility based on the uniqueness of surfactants and microplastics this study provides a theoretical basis for qualitative analysis of the risks of these two pollutants in the

3191,the nonhomogeneous hidden markov model nhmm is a popular statistical downscaling sd approach that can be used for multisite precipitation estimation however the nhmm assumes that once the days with the occurrence of precipitation have been determined the precipitation amounts at each station on wet days can be conditionally independently generated from a parametric family of probability distribution functions without considering impacts from the past precipitation amounts and the neighboring stations such assumptions may lead to underestimation of the spatiotemporal correlations i e temporal autocorrelation and spatial cross correlations of actual multisite precipitation amounts thus this study developed a stepwise downscaling method called the nonhomogeneous hidden markov model vector autoregressive nhmm var in which the nhmm is used to determine the probabilities for dry days and marginal distributions of multisite daily mean precipitation amounts on wet days based on the large scale atmospheric covariates then a var 1 model is used to reproduce the spatiotemporal correlations of actual multisite daily mean precipitation amounts a comparison experiment between the nhmm and the nhmm var models is conducted against outputs from eight global climate models gcms of phase 6 of the coupled model intercomparison project cmip6 over the pearl river basin prb of south china the results show that the nhmm var model performs well not only in modeling the statistical properties but also in reproducing the spatiotemporal correlations of actual multisite daily mean precipitation amounts which indicates that the var model does add value to the nhmm downscaling method keywords multisite precipitation statistical downscaling spatiotemporal correlations nhmm var cmip6 data availability i have shared the link to my data code in the article 1 introduction reliable assessment of climate change impact on regional hydrology relies on high spatial resolution and high precision of climate information especially precipitation li and babovic 2019 global climate models gcms are the primary tools available for making future climate change projections previous works hughes and guttorp 1994a have shown that gcms can replicate key aspects of large scale atmospheric circulation patterns however gcms have shortcomings in modeling regional or local scale ground precipitation due to their coarse spatial resolution e g hundreds of kilometers as well as the poor representation of actual daily scale precipitation in occurrence i e the probability of wet or dry distribution characteristics and spatiotemporal correlations hughes et al 1999 maraun et al 2019 2015 2010 local scale daily precipitation is important since it often serves as input into hydrological agricultural and ecological models for various impact studies thus there have been many efforts to develop downscaling techniques to obtain high resolution and high precision local scale daily precipitation from the gcm estimated large scale daily atmospheric circulation fields dynamic downscaling dd and statistical downscaling sd are two widely used categories of downscaling techniques schmidli et al 2006 dd uses regional climate models rcms forced by gcm estimated atmospheric circulation conditions and observed datasets to represent atmospheric physics with a higher spatial resolution jha et al 2015 on the other hand sd attempts to establish empirical relationships between local scale ground precipitation predictands and gcm estimated large scale atmospheric circulation outputs predictors sd has become more popular compared with dd owing to its low computational cost and easy implementation extensive researches and applications of sd have been carried out during the last three decades abatzoglou and brown 2012 chen et al 2013 2012 2011 gutiérrez et al 2019 jacob et al 2020 jakob themeßl et al 2011 and a comprehensive overview can be found in maraun et al 2019 2010 the nonhomogeneous hidden markov model nhmm represents a broadly useful class of sd approaches hughes and guttorp 1994b it is a stochastic process model based on hidden states i e weather states whose wet dry state transition probability matrix follows a markovian structure given the weather states the daily mean precipitation amounts on wet days at each station would be generated from a parametric family of probability distribution functions namely state dependent distributions hughes et al 1999 hughes and guttorp 1994a the nhmm allows some of its parameters to depend on several covariates which not only makes the nhmm useful as a downscaling method but also can account for the nonstationary characteristics of precipitation under climate change holsclaw et al 2017 the nhmm has been proven to accurately reproduce precipitation occurrence and distribution characteristics of daily scale precipitation charles et al 1999 fu et al 2013 greene et al 2011 guo et al 2019 holsclaw et al 2016 hughes et al 1999 maraun et al 2010 robertson et al 2004 however for multisite precipitation estimation the nhmm assumes multisite precipitation amounts to be spatially and temporally independent of each other but conditioned on the weather states that is once the days with the occurrence of precipitation have been determined the precipitation amounts at each station on wet days are independently generated from a parametric family of probability distribution functions without considering impacts from the past precipitation amounts and the neighboring stations this implies that the nhmm may underestimate the temporal autocorrelation at a single station and spatial cross correlations of actual ground precipitation amounts among them underestimation of temporal variability may lead to an underestimation of the urban flood park et al 2021 riverine flash flood reed et al 2007 and sediment transport and contaminants ogston et al 2000 zonta et al 2005 some studies asserted the importance of rainfall models preserving the temporal variability at a wide range of time scales kim and onof 2020 park et al 2019 paschalis et al 2014 in addition distributed hydrological models generally rely on the spatial patterns of precipitation with precipitation data that differ from observations in terms of spatial patterns in hydrological models may lead to inaccurate results chen et al 2020 fu et al 2011 ma et al 2019 obled et al 1994 rasmussen et al 2012 van de beek et al 2011 thus the spatiotemporal correlations of precipitation should be taken into account in sd methods the temporal autocorrelation characteristic of daily mean precipitation amounts can be accurately represented by a parametric first order autoregressive ar model hannachi 2014 kim and ryu 2015 wiuff 2020 and for modeling the spatial cross correlation characteristics of multisite precipitation amounts the copula has become the most popular method bárdossy and pegram 2009 ben alaya et al 2016 lee 2018 li and babovic 2019 recently the vector autoregressive var model box et al 2008 has received much attention since it can simultaneously model both the temporal autocorrelation and spatial cross correlations of multisite precipitation amounts ben alaya et al 2015 serinaldi and kilsby 2014 note that when modeling the spatiotemporal correlations of multisite precipitation amounts at daily timescale it is important to maintain the temporal intermittency which means periodic temporary cessations of precipitation ben alaya et al 2015 benoit et al 2020 dunkerley 2021 wiuff 2020 in a statistical description intermittency is reflected by the fact that there exists a finite nonzero probability that the value of precipitation within a daily interval is zero lombardo et al 2017 intermittency not only leads to remarkable variability and high positive skewness but also induces the difficulty to reproduce the spatiotemporal correlations of actual multisite daily mean precipitation amounts ben alaya et al 2015 schleiss et al 2011 schleiss and smith 2016 wiuff 2020 kim and olivera 2012 discussed the relative importance of different precipitation statistics in hydrological modeling and concluded that the probability of zero precipitation and lag 1 autocorrelation coefficient explained around 20 of the runoff depth variability and 25 of the peak flow variability respectively therefore considering intermittency in modeling the spatiotemporal correlations of precipitation is crucial the goal of this study is to develop a stepwise nonhomogeneous hidden markov model vector autoregressive nhmm var multisite downscaling model that downscale the gcm estimated large scale atmospheric circulation fields to ground multisite daily precipitation the nhmm var model considers not only the precipitation occurrence and distribution characteristics but also the spatiotemporal correlations of actual ground multisite precipitation amounts in the nhmm var model the nhmm is used to determine the probabilities for dry days and marginal distributions of multisite daily mean precipitation amounts on wet days based on several large scale atmospheric circulation covariates then a var 1 model is used to reproduce both the temporal autocorrelation and spatial cross correlations of actual multisite daily mean precipitation amounts the present paper is structured as follows section 2 describes the study area dataset and methodology thereafter section 3 presents the results including model selection and the comparison between the nhmm and nhmm var models discussions and conclusions are given in sections 4 and 5 respectively 2 study area dataset and methodology 2 1 study area the pearl river is the second largest river by volume in china with annual mean streamflow of 34 9 1010 m3 a wang et al 2018 the pearl river basin prb is located in the subtropical humid monsoon zone of south china fig 1 shows the spatial distribution of the average annual precipitation as can be seen the average annual precipitation in most parts of the prb varies from 800 mm to 2300 mm with more in the east and less in the west in terms of the seasonal variations fig 2 shows the heatmaps of weekly precipitation from 1960 to 2014 two stations i e no 11 and no 69 located in the west and east of the prb are chosen as examples the results show that most of the precipitation occurs in the flood season from april to september which are consistent with previous studies lai et al 2016 zha et al 2020 the pearl river provides much of the inflow to the guangdong hong kong macao greater bay area and thus is of great importance for water resource agriculture and hydropower generation for this region due to its crucial role in the socio economic development of china precipitation changes in the prb have already attracted increasing concern zhang et al 2012 2 2 dataset 2 2 1 observed dataset this study collected observed daily mean precipitation data at 86 meteorological stations fig 1 from 1 january 1960 to 31 december 2014 55 years from the china meteorological administration network following zucchini et al 2017 we discarded observations for 29 february in order to avoid the complication of having 366 days in leap years as a result the length of precipitation time series at each station is 365 55 20075 days the average length of missing values per station is around 40 days and these missing values were substituted with multi year average precipitation values for the same time period and station the average distance between gauge pairs is about 30 km details about the 86 meteorological stations are presented in table s1 supplementary following mao et al 2015 and ma et al 2019 wet days are defined as days with mean precipitation more than 0 1 mm which is also the minimum recorded precipitation value of gauge observations in china observed daily mean large scale atmospheric circulation fields considered as covariates in the state dependent distributions of the nhmm are from ncep ncar reanalysis nnr with 2 5 2 5 resolution kalnay et al 1996 the selection of atmospheric covariates is based on their availability in the gcms outputs based on previous studies guo et al 2019 alternative daily mean atmospheric covariates chosen in this study include sea level pressure slp air temperature at 500 hpa ta500 and 850 hpa ta850 relative humidity at 500 hpa hur500 and 850 hpa hur850 zonal wind at 500 hpa ua500 and 850 hpa ua850 and geopotential height at 500 hpa zg500 and 850 hpa zg850 all of them range 0 n 45 n and 70 e 180 e details about the alternative atmospheric covariates are presented in table 1 the first 30 years from 1 january 1960 to 31 december 1989 of the dataset were used for model calibration and the last 25 years from 1 january 1990 to 31 december 2014 were used for model validation 2 2 2 simulated dataset by global climate models gcm estimated daily mean precipitation and the same nine alternative large scale atmospheric fields as listed in table 1 are obtained from eight global climate models gcms between 1 january 1960 to 31 december 2014 the eight global climate models gcms consist of bcc csm2 mr cnrm cm6 1 canesm5 fgoals g3 ipsl cm6a lr miroc6 mri esm2 0 and noresm2 lm with different spatial resolutions ranging between 100 km and 250 km which are from the latest released coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 dataset cmip6 eyring et al 2016 details about the gcms are presented in table 2 gcm estimated daily mean precipitation has been carefully compared against gauge observations of precipitation the gcm estimated large scale atmospheric fields are interpolated into the grid of ncep ncar reanalysis nnr based on the nearest neighbor method and then considered as covariates in the state dependent distributions of the nhmm for downscaling application 2 3 methodology to consider the spatiotemporal correlations of actual multisite daily mean precipitation amounts we developed a stepwise nhmm var model to downscale the gcm estimated large scale atmospheric circulation fields to ground multisite precipitation which consists of the following two steps step 1 is to determine the probabilities for dry days and marginal distributions of multisite daily mean precipitation amounts on wet days based on the nhmm and step 2 is to reproduce the spatiotemporal correlations of actual multisite daily mean precipitation amounts based on the var 1 model which considers both lag 1 autocorrelation and cross correlations of multisite precipitation amounts simultaneously in step 2 a probability transformation method is used to transfer the actual intermittent precipitation processes to normalized continuous precipitation processes fig 3 shows the structure diagram of the nhmm var model which will be described in detail in the next section 2 3 1 nonhomogeneous hidden markov model nhmm 2 3 1 1 hidden markov model hmm let y t y 1 t y k t y k t t 1 t represents multisite daily mean precipitation with each component y k t at station k and at time t k and t e g k 86 and t 20075 in this study denote the total number of precipitation stations and the length of precipitation time series respectively the hidden markov model hmm hughes et al 1999 hughes and guttorp 1994a 1994b is a stochastic process model which consists of two parts firstly the daily discrete wet dry weather states s t 1 2 m whose state transition probability matrix p s t s t 1 follow a first order markovian structure and secondly the state dependent distribution f y t s t θ which represents the distribution of multisite precipitation y t y 1 t y k t y k t given the weather state s t at time t where θ θ 1 θ k θ k denotes the parameter set of the state dependent distribution three key assumptions underlie the hmm holsclaw et al 2016 the first assumption is that the weather states s t are assumed to be first order markov 1 p s t s t 1 p s t s t 1 where s t 1 s 1 s 2 s t 1 is the vector of previous weather states until time t 1 the second assumption is that given the weather state s t at time t the multisite daily mean precipitation amounts y t y 1 t y k t y k t are series independent and conditionally independent of previous weather states 2 f y t y t 1 s t θ f y t s t θ where y t 1 y 1 y 2 y t 1 is the matrix of previous multisite precipitation amounts until time t 1 and s t s 1 s 2 s t is the vector of weather states until time t the third assumption is that the multisite daily mean precipitation amounts y t y 1 t y k t y k t are conditionally independent of each other 3 f y t s t θ k 1 k f k y k t s t θ k where f k denotes the state dependent distribution of the component y k t at station k and θ k denotes the parameter set of the state dependent distribution f k 2 3 1 2 nonhomogeneous hidden markov model nhmm the nonhomogeneous hidden markov model nhmm is an extended version of the hidden markov model charles et al 1999 fu et al 2013 guo et al 2019 holsclaw et al 2017 2016 hughes et al 1999 hughes and guttorp 1994a 1994b the nhmm allows some of its parameters to depend on several covariates such as parameters of the state transition probability matrix or the state dependent distributions or even both which not only allows the nhmm to be used as a downscaling method but also could account for the nonstationary characteristics of precipitation under climate change holsclaw et al 2017 consider a covariates x t x 1 t x 2 t x a t at time t in the state transition probability matrix which allows for seasonal variability in the wet dry state transition processes for example woolhiser and pegram 1979 and zucchini et al 2017 incorporated seasonal effects into the wet dry state transition processes by a finite fourier series the time varying state transition probabilities can be modeled via a multinomial logistic link function 4 p s t s t 1 x t φ exp α 0 i j x t α j m 1 m exp α 0 i m x t α m where i j 1 2 m denote certain weather states for notational convenience we let φ α 0 i j α j represents the parameter set of the state transition probability matrix consider b covariates w k t w 1 k t w 2 k t w b k t in the state dependent distribution f k t at station k and at time t by a generalized linear model glm through a probit link function 5 f k t y k t s t w k t θ k s t ϕ 0 k t δ 0 y k t ϕ 1 k t d k s t y k t λ k s t and 6 ϕ k t g 1 β 0 k s t w k t β k where f k t denotes the state dependent distribution of the component y k t at station k and at time t the delta function δ 0 at zero allows zero inflation on dry days and a probability distribution function d k s t is used for describing daily mean precipitation amounts on wet days the probability distribution function d k s t may be a single distribution or a mixed distribution depending on distribution s performance and physical significance in different study areas the mixing probabilities ϕ k t ϕ 0 k t ϕ 1 k t ϕ 0 k t ϕ 1 k t 1 are assumed to be dependent on the b covariates w k t w 1 k t w 2 k t w b k t which allows the state dependent distribution f k t to be time varying in the bayesian framework the gibbs sampling algorithm relies on the probit form of the ordered multinomial which means the distributions δ 0 and d k s t in the nhmm are ordered dry and wet respectively θ k s t β 0 k s t β k λ k s t is the parameter set of the state dependent distribution f k t which depends on the weather state s t at current time t it is noteworthy that the three assumptions of the hmm remain in the nhmm the first assumption is referred to the case of the first order markov chain if necessary the markov chain could be easily extended to a higher order the second assumption i e the multisite daily mean precipitation amounts are series independent and conditionally independent of previous weather states implies the nhmm may underestimate the temporal autocorrelation of actual precipitation amounts at a single station meanwhile the third assumption i e the multisite daily mean precipitation amounts are conditionally independent of each other implies that the nhmm may underestimate the spatial cross correlations of actual multisite daily mean precipitation amounts among them holsclaw et al 2016 to make up for the deficiencies of the nhmm we incorporated the vector autoregressive var model to reproduce the spatiotemporal correlations of actual multisite daily mean precipitation amounts 2 3 2 vector autoregressive var model among multisite time series models the vector autoregressive var model is most widely used in practice due to its relative ease of implementation box et al 2008 which is suitable for modeling the spatiotemporal correlations of multisite time series processes both contemporaneously and across time lags in this study the 1 order vector autoregressive model or var 1 model is used to reproduce the spatiotemporal correlations of actual multisite daily mean precipitation amounts before using the var 1 model for reproducing the spatiotemporal correlations of actual multisite daily mean precipitation amounts we apply a probability transformation method ben alaya et al 2015 to transfer the actual intermittent precipitation processes y t y 1 t y k t y k t to normalized continuous precipitation processes z t z 1 t z k t z k t 7 z k t φ 1 d k s t y k t if y k t y 0 φ 1 r u n i f 0 ϕ 0 k t if y k t y 0 where z k t is the normalized precipitation at station k and at time t φ 1 denotes the standard normal inverse cumulative distribution function d k s t is the cumulative distribution function corresponding to the probability distribution function d k s t on wet days ϕ 0 k t denotes the probability for dry days r u n i f

represents the threshold for defining the wet days e g y 0 0 1 mm in this study days with mean precipitation more than y 0 are defined as wet days otherwise defined as dry days then the var 1 model is applied to the normalized continuous precipitation processes z t z 1 t z k t z k t to reproduce the spatiotemporal correlations of actual multisite daily mean precipitation amounts 8 z t ψz t 1 a t

involved in calibrating and validating the model 2 3 3 1 calibration in the calibration period let y t cal y 1 t cal y k t cal y k t cal represents the vector of actual multisite daily mean precipitation x t cal x 1 t cal x 2 t cal x a t cal represents the vector of covariates in the state transition probabilities matrix and w k t cal w 1 k t cal w 2 k t cal w b k t cal represents the vector of covariates in the state dependent distribution f k t at station k at time t respectively the superscript cal represents dataset in the calibration period parameter set θ φ θ s t of the nhmm can be estimated by the bayesian inference method where θ s t θ 1 s t θ k s t θ k s t denote the parameters in the state dependent distributions f t f 1 t f k t f k t the joint likelihood function of multisite precipitation amounts and weather states in the nhmm is given by 10 l y cal x cal w cal θ t 1 t k 1 k f k t y k t cal s t w k t cal θ k s t p s t s t 1 x t cal φ the posterior probability

function and ω is the entire parameter space for more detail about parameter estimation kindly refer to holsclaw et al 2016 once the parameter set θ φ θ s t of the nhmm have been estimated the state dependent distribution f k t at station k and at time t can be determined as follows 12 f k t y k t s t w k t cal θ k s t ϕ 0 k t δ 0 y k t ϕ 1 k t d k s t y k t λ k s t where d k s t represents the estimated probability distribution function on wet days ϕ 0 k t and ϕ 1 k t represent the estimated mixing probabilities then based on the estimated state dependent distribution f k t the normalized precipitation z k t cal at station k and at time t can be calculated by 13 z k t cal φ 1 d k s t y k t cal if y k t cal y 0 φ 1 r u n i f 0 ϕ 0 k t if y k t cal y 0 where d k s t represents the cumulative distribution function corresponding to the estimated probability distribution function d k s t on wet days given the weather state s t at station k ϕ 0 k t is the estimated probability for dry days finally to reproduce spatiotemporal correlations for the multisite normalized continuous precipitation processes z t cal z 1 t cal z k t cal z k t cal we have the var 1 model as 14 z t cal ψz

probability matrix p s t s t 1 x t val φ and the state dependent distribution of precipitation at each station k 15 f k t y k t s t w k t val θ k s t ϕ 0 k t δ 0 y k t ϕ 1 k t d k s t y k t λ k s t at the same time it is possible to randomly generate simulations z t val z 1 t val z k t val z k t val with spatiotemporal correlations from the calibrated var 1 model ultimately the estimated synthetic

cumulative distribution function corresponding to the estimated probability distribution function d k s t on wet days of the nhmm given the weather state s t at station k φ denotes standard normal cumulative distribution function ϕ 0 k t is the estimated probability for dry days 2 4 model selection criteria precipitation indices and evaluation metrics 2 4 1 model selection criteria there are three types of variables or functions that need to be optimized in the nhmm including 1 state dependent distribution f k t 2 the number of daily discrete wet dry weather states m and 3 covariates x t and w k t in the state transition probability matrix and the state dependent distributions respectively following holsclaw et al 2017 two criteria are used for model selection the bayesian information criterion bic schwarz 1978 and the predictive log score pls gneiting and raftery 2007 the bic is calculated for the model fit and the pls is calculated for the predictive ability of the model a lower value of bic and higher value of pls represent a better result 2 4 2 precipitation indices the estimated precipitation was evaluated by calculating precipitation indices as stipulated by the eu cost action value maraun et al 2019 2015 as listed in table 3 a total of eight precipitation indices were selected including 1 mean precipitation on wet days pm 2 standard deviation of precipitation on wet days psd 3 the 99th percentile of precipitation on wet days p99th 4 the 99 9th percentile of precipitation on wet days p99 9th 5 the 99th percentile of wet spell length wsl99th 6 the 99th percentile of dry spell length dsl99th 7 lag 1 autocorrelation ac1 and 8 lag 0 cross correlations cc0 which are of interest in climate impact assessments 2 4 3 evaluation metrics to compare the performances of the downscaling methods quantitatively the root mean squared error rmse is used as evaluation metric to compare the performance of the downscaling models in reproducing precipitation characteristics in particular to compare the performance of the downscaling models in reproducing spatial cross correlations based on the euclidean distance ed we defined a spatial relative similarity srs metric as follows 17 ed k k 1 2 cc 0 est cc0 obs 2 and 18 srs min ed 1 ed where cc0 obs and cc 0 est denote observed and estimated cross correlations of daily mean precipitation for each pair of stations respectively k k 1 2 is to avoid double calculation of the correlation coefficient between any two stations based on the all simulations the minimum euclidean distance ed is denoted by min ed ed 0 the value of the srs metric lies between 0 and 1 and a value closer to 1 presents a better result 3 results 3 1 model selection the results of model selection are presented in this section including 1 state dependent distribution f k t 2 number of daily discrete wet dry weather states m and 3 covariates x t and w k t in the state transition probability matrix and the state dependent distributions respectively 3 1 1 state dependent distribution in this paper four distributions were considered for precipitation amounts on wet days including exponential exp gamma gam mixed double exponential mix2exp and mixed exponential generalized pareto mixexpp to select the most suitable distribution we compared the performance of each in reproducing the observed distribution of precipitation amounts on wet days for all 86 stations as shown in fig 5 the mixexpp distribution outperforms the other three distributions on the upper tail the results are consistent with previous studies chen and brissette 2014 hundecha et al 2009 li et al 2012 so et al 2015 which turn out that the generalized pareto gp distribution combined with the exponential exp distribution shows a good ability in modeling extreme precipitation extreme precipitation thus this paper used the optimal mixexpp distribution for wet days together with the delta function δ 0 for dry days as the state dependent distribution in the nhmm that is 19 f k t y k t s t w k t θ k s t ϕ 0 k t δ 0 y k t ϕ 1 k t exp k s t y k t γ k s t ϕ 2 k t gp k s t y k t σ k s t ξ k s t where exp k s t and gp k s t denote probability distribution functions of the exponential exp and the generalized pareto gp distribution respectively γ k s t σ k s t and ξ k s t are parameters of the mixed exponential generalized pareto mixexpp distribution the mixing probabilities ϕ k t ϕ 0 k t ϕ 1 k t ϕ 2 k t ϕ 0 k t ϕ 1 k t ϕ 2 k t 1 are assumed to be dependent on b atmospheric covariates w k t w 1 k t w 2 k t w b k t 3 1 2 number of weather states the nhmm with a different number m from 2 to 8 of weather states were fitted to the observed datasets from table 4 it can be seen that the bic reaches its minimum value and the pls reaches its maximum at m 7 fig 6 shows the probability of daily precipitation occurrence at each station for each of the seven weather states state 1 represents a low probability of precipitation occurring across the whole prb state 2 state 3 and state 4 represent a high probability of precipitation occurring over the west middle and east of the prb respectively state 5 represents a high probability of precipitation occurring over the east and a median probability of precipitation occurring over the west of the prb state 6 is the opposite of state 5 while state 7 represents a high probability of precipitation occurring over the whole prb 3 1 3 covariates 3 1 3 1 covariates in the state transition probability matrix the probability of precipitation occurrence shows significant seasonal variations as shown in fig 2 thus to incorporate seasonality into the state transition probability matrix trigonometric functions were used zucchini et al 2017 multiple sine cosine pairs can be included to model complex seasonal patterns the number of sine cosine pairs was chosen by the bic and the pls as shown in table 5 the bic reaches its minimum value and the pls reaches its maximum values when incorporating two sine cosine pairs into the state transition probability matrix 3 1 3 2 covariates in the state dependent distributions to select appropriate atmospheric covariates in the state dependent distributions of the nhmm based on the observed daily mean datasets we first calculated the pearson s correlation coefficients between the basin averaged precipitation and the nine alternative nnr based atmospheric fields as listed in table 1 at each grid the obtained correlation maps helped us to select the most relevant atmospheric factors and their spatial regions fig 7 shows the correlations between the observed daily mean precipitation over the prb and the observed daily mean atmospheric fields as seen except the zg500 not shown the other eight atmospheric fields are significantly correlated with the observed daily mean precipitation the areas marked by black dots indicate the correlations are significant at the 0 05 level to further determine the covariates in the state dependent distributions we performed the multi step leave one out validation and compared the model performances based on the bic and the pls in addition to reduce the dimensionality of the selected covariates the principal component analysis pca method was applied to the normalized atmospheric fields table 6 shows the bic and the pls of the nhmm models with different combinations of atmospheric covariates in the state dependent distributions the results indicate that a combination of hur500 hur850 ua850 and zg850 is the optimal choice ultimately the first 20 principal components of the above four normalized atmospheric fields i e hur500 hur850 ua850 and zg850 within the significant correlation areas marked by black dots in fig 7 were selected as covariates in the state dependent distributions based on the cumulative variance explained by more than 80 3 2 model validation to validate the performance of the nhmm and the nhmm var models the observed dataset from 1 january 1990 to 31 december 2014 25 years were considered as the validation set the results of estimated daily mean precipitation were compared to observed daily mean precipitation in terms of statistical properties i e pm psd p99th p99 9th wsl99th and dsl99th and spatiotemporal correlations i e ac1 and cc0 fig 8 a b shows the weekly precipitation process during the year 2014 at station no 11 and station no 69 respectively both the nhmm and the nhmm var models give probabilistic predictions thus the 95 confidence interval ci of precipitation generated from 100 simulations are presented here fig 9 a g presents the scatter plots of the seven estimated precipitation indices i e pm psd p99th p99 9th wsl99th dsl99th and ac1 by the two models nhmm and nhmm var against those of the observed results for all 86 stations q q plot of the estimated wet spell length wsl and dry spell length dsl by the two models nhmm and nhmm var against those of the observed results at station no 11 and station no 69 during the validation period are presented in fig s1 supplementary fig 10 a c presents the lag 0 cross correlations cc0 of daily mean precipitation for the 86 86 pairs of stations quantitatively table 7 shows the rmse and srs of the precipitation indices between the observed and the two modeled nhmm estimated and nhmm var estimated precipitation the two metrics rmse and srs are calculated from the median precipitation indices of 100 simulations the results from fig 9 a d and table 7 indicate that the mixexpp distribution assumed in the nhmm and nhmm var models is able to accurately capture the four statistical properties i e pm psd p99th and p99 9th of daily mean precipitation on wet days since the points are close to the 1 1 line specifically in terms of the pm and the p99th the nhmm var model slightly outperforms the nhmm since it obtains lower rmses however in terms of the psd and the p99 9th the nhmm var model is slightly worse than the nhmm since it obtains higher rmses the wet and dry spells represent the persistence in the precipitation occurrence process and have a great significance in hydrology agriculture and water resources management li and babovic 2019 the results from fig 9 e f and table 7 show that the nhmm var model is slightly better than the nhmm in terms of reproducing wet spell length wsl and dry spell length dsl however there is still an underestimation of the wsl99th and the dsl99th which indicates the first order markov chains assumed in the nhmm may be inadequate to model complex wet dry spells subsequent research should develop models to improve the accuracy of precipitation occurrence simulation for example higher order markov chains wilks 1999 or more appropriate covariates in the state transition matrix of the nhmm may be considered lag 1 temporal autocorrelation ac1 represents the short term persistence in the precipitation process li and babovic 2019 as expected fig 9 g and table 7 show that the nhmm var model outperforms the nhmm in reproducing the ac1 since it obtains the lower rmse however there is still an underestimation of the ac1 the reason may be that the precipitation occurrence is not faultlessly reproduced by the first order markov chains and the temporal autocorrelation was weakened when using the inverse cumulative distribution function to transfer the normalized continuous precipitation processes to the synthetic precipitation series as shown in equation 16 but anyway the above results show that the var model does add value to the nhmm downscaling method in reproducing the temporal autocorrelation in terms of the lag 0 cross correlations cc0 the results from fig 10 show that the nhmm var model evidently outperforms the nhmm since the nhmm var estimated cc0 has a more similar pattern to that of observed quantitatively table 7 further indicates that the nhmm var model is better since the nhmm var model obtains a higher srs with a value of 0 83 than the nhmm with a srs value of 0 62 this result is not unexpected since the nhmm does not consider the spatial cross correlations of multisite precipitation amounts indeed in its model structure though the presence of the m discrete weather states in the nhmm ensures that some degree of spatial dependence across stations is captured via the weather states holsclaw et al 2016 the spatial dependence is not directed at the precipitation processes the results prove that the var model does add value to the nhmm downscaling method in reproducing the spatial correlations 3 3 comparison of downscaling performances between nhmm and nhmm var in this section we compare downscaling performances between nhmm and nhmm var based on eight gcms datasets during the entire period from 1 january 1960 to 31 december 2014 to eliminate systematic bias existing in gcm estimated atmospheric fields the combined atmospheric fields from gcms were projected onto the 20 nnr based principal components structures as stated in section 3 1 3 the obtained 20 principal components were then used in nhmm and nhmm var models to perform downscaling modeling 3 3 1 statistical properties figs 11 13 present the scatter plots of the estimated precipitation indices i e pm p99th and wsl99th by the three models raw gcm nhmm and nhmm var against those of the observed results for all 86 stations scatter plots of more precipitation indices i e psd p99 9th and dsl99th are presented in figs s2 s4 in terms of the four statistical properties i e pm psd p99th and p99 9th figs 11 12 and figs s2 s3 indicate that both the nhmm and the nhmm var models show great improvement compared to the raw gcms except for the canesm5 the nhmm var model is slightly better than the nhmm in terms of the pm and the p99th but slightly worse in terms of the psd and the p99 9th which are consistent with the results during the validation period as shown in section 3 2 in terms of the wsl99th and the dsl99th as can be seen from fig 13 and fig s4 all raw gcms show significant overestimation of the wsl99th and underestimation of the dsl99th and both the nhmm and the nhmm var models show great improvement compared to the raw gcms the nhmm var model is slightly better than the nhmm in terms of reproducing the wsl99th for the bcc csm2 mr canesm5 cnrm cm6 1 miroc6 mri esm2 0 and noresm2 lm in addition both the nhmm and the nhmm var models show satisfying results in terms of reproducing the wsl99th for the fgoals g3 and ipsl cm6a lr however there is almost no difference between the nhmm and the nhmm var models in terms of reproducing the dsl99th 3 3 2 spatiotemporal correlations fig 14 presents the estimated ac1 by the three models raw gcm nhmm and nhmm var against that of the observed results for all 86 stations as seen the nhmm var model outperforms the nhmm in reproducing the temporal autocorrelation of precipitation for all eight gcms since most of the points of the nhmm var model are closer to the 1 1 line in terms of the lag 0 cross correlations cc0 here take the ipsl cm6a lr as an example other gcms have similar results fig 15 shows that the raw gcm overestimates the cc0 of actual multisite daily mean precipitation amounts and the nhmm generally underestimates the spatial cross correlations of actual multisite daily mean precipitation amounts for most of the stations the nhmm var model could reproduce the spatial cross correlations of actual multisite daily mean precipitation amounts more effectively since the nhmm var estimated cc0 has more similar patterns to the observed cc0 on the other hand from table 8 it is evident that the nhmm var model outperforms the nhmm in terms of srs with values from 0 64 to 0 71 higher than that of the nhmm with values of approximately 0 57 the raw gcms obtain the smallest srs with values from 0 26 to 0 29 4 discussions 4 1 comparison of multi source uncertainties to systematically evaluate the magnitude of multi source uncertainties as well as the relative contributions to the total uncertainty of the estimated synthetic precipitation this paper quantified the three uncertainty sources i e the gcm datasets parameters of the nhmm var model and the interaction between both of them using the anova method ma et al 2018b 2018a fig 16 shows the relative contribution of three uncertainty components i e gcm datasets parameters of the nhmm var model and interaction between both of them to the total uncertainty for the estimated precipitation as can be seen that both the gcm datasets and the parameters of the nhmm var model contribute to total uncertainty at a lower proportion with percentage values of approximately 10 20 and 10 respectively furthermore it is visible that the uncertainty generated from the interaction between both of them is dominated in magnitude and contributes the greatest proportion of total uncertainty with percentage values ranging from 70 to 80 the results indicate that we should pay attention to the comprehensive analysis of uncertainty sources especially the interaction between several individual uncertainty sources 4 2 comparison of downscaling performances with raw and bias corrected covariates of gcm in this section we compare downscaling performances of the nhmm var models based on raw gcm estimated covariates and bias corrected covariates a detailed discussion about such an issue is necessary since the bias existing in the gcm estimated covariates will be transferred to the final estimated synthetic precipitation fig 17 a d shows the scatter plots of the four estimated precipitation indices i e pm p99th dsl99th and ac1 by the three models raw gcm nhmm var with raw covariates and nhmm var with bias corrected covariates against those of the observed results for all 86 stations scatter plots of more precipitation indices i e psd p99 9th and dsl99th are presented in figs s5 s7 the results indicate that the nhmm var model with raw gcm estimated covariates overestimates the statistical properties of precipitation including pm psd p99th and p99 9th but in terms of the wsl99th dsl99th and ac1 the nhmm var model with raw gcm estimated covariates obtains a similar result to the nhmm var model with bias corrected covariates in terms of the cc0 fig 18 a d indicates that the nhmm var model with raw gcm estimated covariates underestimates the spatial cross correlation and shows poor performance than the nhmm var model with bias corrected covariates the above results prove that correcting the bias existing in the gcm estimated covariates is indeed necessary before applying them in the downscaling application 5 conclusions this study developed an effective nonhomogeneous hidden markov model vector autoregressive nhmm var model for downscaling the gcm estimated large scale atmospheric circulation fields to ground multisite precipitation in the nhmm var model the nhmm is used to determine the probabilities for dry days and marginal distributions of multisite daily mean precipitation amounts on wet days based on several gcm estimated covariates then a var 1 model is used to reproduce the spatiotemporal correlations i e temporal autocorrelation and spatial cross correlations of actual multisite daily mean precipitation amounts simultaneously the performances of the nhmm var model were demonstrated by comparing with the original nhmm the following main conclusions can be drawn 1 both the nhmm and nhmm var models perform well in terms of modeling the statistical properties of precipitation i e occurrence and distributions characteristics 2 the nhmm var model outperforms the nhmm with respect to reproducing the spatiotemporal correlations of actual multisite daily mean precipitation amounts this indicates that the var model does add value to the nhmm downscaling method 3 compared to the two individual uncertainty sources i e the gcm datasets and parameters of the nhmm var model of the estimated synthetic precipitation the uncertainty generated from the interaction between both of the two individual uncertainty sources contributes the greatest proportion of total uncertainty with percentage values ranging from 70 to 80 4 correcting the bias existing in the gcm estimated covariates is indeed necessary before applying them in the downscaling application since the nhmm var model with the raw gcm estimated covariates shows poor performance than the nhmm var model with bias corrected covariates overall the developed nhmm var model is a competitive methodology for downscaling the gcm

3191,the nonhomogeneous hidden markov model nhmm is a popular statistical downscaling sd approach that can be used for multisite precipitation estimation however the nhmm assumes that once the days with the occurrence of precipitation have been determined the precipitation amounts at each station on wet days can be conditionally independently generated from a parametric family of probability distribution functions without considering impacts from the past precipitation amounts and the neighboring stations such assumptions may lead to underestimation of the spatiotemporal correlations i e temporal autocorrelation and spatial cross correlations of actual multisite precipitation amounts thus this study developed a stepwise downscaling method called the nonhomogeneous hidden markov model vector autoregressive nhmm var in which the nhmm is used to determine the probabilities for dry days and marginal distributions of multisite daily mean precipitation amounts on wet days based on the large scale atmospheric covariates then a var 1 model is used to reproduce the spatiotemporal correlations of actual multisite daily mean precipitation amounts a comparison experiment between the nhmm and the nhmm var models is conducted against outputs from eight global climate models gcms of phase 6 of the coupled model intercomparison project cmip6 over the pearl river basin prb of south china the results show that the nhmm var model performs well not only in modeling the statistical properties but also in reproducing the spatiotemporal correlations of actual multisite daily mean precipitation amounts which indicates that the var model does add value to the nhmm downscaling method keywords multisite precipitation statistical downscaling spatiotemporal correlations nhmm var cmip6 data availability i have shared the link to my data code in the article 1 introduction reliable assessment of climate change impact on regional hydrology relies on high spatial resolution and high precision of climate information especially precipitation li and babovic 2019 global climate models gcms are the primary tools available for making future climate change projections previous works hughes and guttorp 1994a have shown that gcms can replicate key aspects of large scale atmospheric circulation patterns however gcms have shortcomings in modeling regional or local scale ground precipitation due to their coarse spatial resolution e g hundreds of kilometers as well as the poor representation of actual daily scale precipitation in occurrence i e the probability of wet or dry distribution characteristics and spatiotemporal correlations hughes et al 1999 maraun et al 2019 2015 2010 local scale daily precipitation is important since it often serves as input into hydrological agricultural and ecological models for various impact studies thus there have been many efforts to develop downscaling techniques to obtain high resolution and high precision local scale daily precipitation from the gcm estimated large scale daily atmospheric circulation fields dynamic downscaling dd and statistical downscaling sd are two widely used categories of downscaling techniques schmidli et al 2006 dd uses regional climate models rcms forced by gcm estimated atmospheric circulation conditions and observed datasets to represent atmospheric physics with a higher spatial resolution jha et al 2015 on the other hand sd attempts to establish empirical relationships between local scale ground precipitation predictands and gcm estimated large scale atmospheric circulation outputs predictors sd has become more popular compared with dd owing to its low computational cost and easy implementation extensive researches and applications of sd have been carried out during the last three decades abatzoglou and brown 2012 chen et al 2013 2012 2011 gutiérrez et al 2019 jacob et al 2020 jakob themeßl et al 2011 and a comprehensive overview can be found in maraun et al 2019 2010 the nonhomogeneous hidden markov model nhmm represents a broadly useful class of sd approaches hughes and guttorp 1994b it is a stochastic process model based on hidden states i e weather states whose wet dry state transition probability matrix follows a markovian structure given the weather states the daily mean precipitation amounts on wet days at each station would be generated from a parametric family of probability distribution functions namely state dependent distributions hughes et al 1999 hughes and guttorp 1994a the nhmm allows some of its parameters to depend on several covariates which not only makes the nhmm useful as a downscaling method but also can account for the nonstationary characteristics of precipitation under climate change holsclaw et al 2017 the nhmm has been proven to accurately reproduce precipitation occurrence and distribution characteristics of daily scale precipitation charles et al 1999 fu et al 2013 greene et al 2011 guo et al 2019 holsclaw et al 2016 hughes et al 1999 maraun et al 2010 robertson et al 2004 however for multisite precipitation estimation the nhmm assumes multisite precipitation amounts to be spatially and temporally independent of each other but conditioned on the weather states that is once the days with the occurrence of precipitation have been determined the precipitation amounts at each station on wet days are independently generated from a parametric family of probability distribution functions without considering impacts from the past precipitation amounts and the neighboring stations this implies that the nhmm may underestimate the temporal autocorrelation at a single station and spatial cross correlations of actual ground precipitation amounts among them underestimation of temporal variability may lead to an underestimation of the urban flood park et al 2021 riverine flash flood reed et al 2007 and sediment transport and contaminants ogston et al 2000 zonta et al 2005 some studies asserted the importance of rainfall models preserving the temporal variability at a wide range of time scales kim and onof 2020 park et al 2019 paschalis et al 2014 in addition distributed hydrological models generally rely on the spatial patterns of precipitation with precipitation data that differ from observations in terms of spatial patterns in hydrological models may lead to inaccurate results chen et al 2020 fu et al 2011 ma et al 2019 obled et al 1994 rasmussen et al 2012 van de beek et al 2011 thus the spatiotemporal correlations of precipitation should be taken into account in sd methods the temporal autocorrelation characteristic of daily mean precipitation amounts can be accurately represented by a parametric first order autoregressive ar model hannachi 2014 kim and ryu 2015 wiuff 2020 and for modeling the spatial cross correlation characteristics of multisite precipitation amounts the copula has become the most popular method bárdossy and pegram 2009 ben alaya et al 2016 lee 2018 li and babovic 2019 recently the vector autoregressive var model box et al 2008 has received much attention since it can simultaneously model both the temporal autocorrelation and spatial cross correlations of multisite precipitation amounts ben alaya et al 2015 serinaldi and kilsby 2014 note that when modeling the spatiotemporal correlations of multisite precipitation amounts at daily timescale it is important to maintain the temporal intermittency which means periodic temporary cessations of precipitation ben alaya et al 2015 benoit et al 2020 dunkerley 2021 wiuff 2020 in a statistical description intermittency is reflected by the fact that there exists a finite nonzero probability that the value of precipitation within a daily interval is zero lombardo et al 2017 intermittency not only leads to remarkable variability and high positive skewness but also induces the difficulty to reproduce the spatiotemporal correlations of actual multisite daily mean precipitation amounts ben alaya et al 2015 schleiss et al 2011 schleiss and smith 2016 wiuff 2020 kim and olivera 2012 discussed the relative importance of different precipitation statistics in hydrological modeling and concluded that the probability of zero precipitation and lag 1 autocorrelation coefficient explained around 20 of the runoff depth variability and 25 of the peak flow variability respectively therefore considering intermittency in modeling the spatiotemporal correlations of precipitation is crucial the goal of this study is to develop a stepwise nonhomogeneous hidden markov model vector autoregressive nhmm var multisite downscaling model that downscale the gcm estimated large scale atmospheric circulation fields to ground multisite daily precipitation the nhmm var model considers not only the precipitation occurrence and distribution characteristics but also the spatiotemporal correlations of actual ground multisite precipitation amounts in the nhmm var model the nhmm is used to determine the probabilities for dry days and marginal distributions of multisite daily mean precipitation amounts on wet days based on several large scale atmospheric circulation covariates then a var 1 model is used to reproduce both the temporal autocorrelation and spatial cross correlations of actual multisite daily mean precipitation amounts the present paper is structured as follows section 2 describes the study area dataset and methodology thereafter section 3 presents the results including model selection and the comparison between the nhmm and nhmm var models discussions and conclusions are given in sections 4 and 5 respectively 2 study area dataset and methodology 2 1 study area the pearl river is the second largest river by volume in china with annual mean streamflow of 34 9 1010 m3 a wang et al 2018 the pearl river basin prb is located in the subtropical humid monsoon zone of south china fig 1 shows the spatial distribution of the average annual precipitation as can be seen the average annual precipitation in most parts of the prb varies from 800 mm to 2300 mm with more in the east and less in the west in terms of the seasonal variations fig 2 shows the heatmaps of weekly precipitation from 1960 to 2014 two stations i e no 11 and no 69 located in the west and east of the prb are chosen as examples the results show that most of the precipitation occurs in the flood season from april to september which are consistent with previous studies lai et al 2016 zha et al 2020 the pearl river provides much of the inflow to the guangdong hong kong macao greater bay area and thus is of great importance for water resource agriculture and hydropower generation for this region due to its crucial role in the socio economic development of china precipitation changes in the prb have already attracted increasing concern zhang et al 2012 2 2 dataset 2 2 1 observed dataset this study collected observed daily mean precipitation data at 86 meteorological stations fig 1 from 1 january 1960 to 31 december 2014 55 years from the china meteorological administration network following zucchini et al 2017 we discarded observations for 29 february in order to avoid the complication of having 366 days in leap years as a result the length of precipitation time series at each station is 365 55 20075 days the average length of missing values per station is around 40 days and these missing values were substituted with multi year average precipitation values for the same time period and station the average distance between gauge pairs is about 30 km details about the 86 meteorological stations are presented in table s1 supplementary following mao et al 2015 and ma et al 2019 wet days are defined as days with mean precipitation more than 0 1 mm which is also the minimum recorded precipitation value of gauge observations in china observed daily mean large scale atmospheric circulation fields considered as covariates in the state dependent distributions of the nhmm are from ncep ncar reanalysis nnr with 2 5 2 5 resolution kalnay et al 1996 the selection of atmospheric covariates is based on their availability in the gcms outputs based on previous studies guo et al 2019 alternative daily mean atmospheric covariates chosen in this study include sea level pressure slp air temperature at 500 hpa ta500 and 850 hpa ta850 relative humidity at 500 hpa hur500 and 850 hpa hur850 zonal wind at 500 hpa ua500 and 850 hpa ua850 and geopotential height at 500 hpa zg500 and 850 hpa zg850 all of them range 0 n 45 n and 70 e 180 e details about the alternative atmospheric covariates are presented in table 1 the first 30 years from 1 january 1960 to 31 december 1989 of the dataset were used for model calibration and the last 25 years from 1 january 1990 to 31 december 2014 were used for model validation 2 2 2 simulated dataset by global climate models gcm estimated daily mean precipitation and the same nine alternative large scale atmospheric fields as listed in table 1 are obtained from eight global climate models gcms between 1 january 1960 to 31 december 2014 the eight global climate models gcms consist of bcc csm2 mr cnrm cm6 1 canesm5 fgoals g3 ipsl cm6a lr miroc6 mri esm2 0 and noresm2 lm with different spatial resolutions ranging between 100 km and 250 km which are from the latest released coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 dataset cmip6 eyring et al 2016 details about the gcms are presented in table 2 gcm estimated daily mean precipitation has been carefully compared against gauge observations of precipitation the gcm estimated large scale atmospheric fields are interpolated into the grid of ncep ncar reanalysis nnr based on the nearest neighbor method and then considered as covariates in the state dependent distributions of the nhmm for downscaling application 2 3 methodology to consider the spatiotemporal correlations of actual multisite daily mean precipitation amounts we developed a stepwise nhmm var model to downscale the gcm estimated large scale atmospheric circulation fields to ground multisite precipitation which consists of the following two steps step 1 is to determine the probabilities for dry days and marginal distributions of multisite daily mean precipitation amounts on wet days based on the nhmm and step 2 is to reproduce the spatiotemporal correlations of actual multisite daily mean precipitation amounts based on the var 1 model which considers both lag 1 autocorrelation and cross correlations of multisite precipitation amounts simultaneously in step 2 a probability transformation method is used to transfer the actual intermittent precipitation processes to normalized continuous precipitation processes fig 3 shows the structure diagram of the nhmm var model which will be described in detail in the next section 2 3 1 nonhomogeneous hidden markov model nhmm 2 3 1 1 hidden markov model hmm let y t y 1 t y k t y k t t 1 t represents multisite daily mean precipitation with each component y k t at station k and at time t k and t e g k 86 and t 20075 in this study denote the total number of precipitation stations and the length of precipitation time series respectively the hidden markov model hmm hughes et al 1999 hughes and guttorp 1994a 1994b is a stochastic process model which consists of two parts firstly the daily discrete wet dry weather states s t 1 2 m whose state transition probability matrix p s t s t 1 follow a first order markovian structure and secondly the state dependent distribution f y t s t θ which represents the distribution of multisite precipitation y t y 1 t y k t y k t given the weather state s t at time t where θ θ 1 θ k θ k denotes the parameter set of the state dependent distribution three key assumptions underlie the hmm holsclaw et al 2016 the first assumption is that the weather states s t are assumed to be first order markov 1 p s t s t 1 p s t s t 1 where s t 1 s 1 s 2 s t 1 is the vector of previous weather states until time t 1 the second assumption is that given the weather state s t at time t the multisite daily mean precipitation amounts y t y 1 t y k t y k t are series independent and conditionally independent of previous weather states 2 f y t y t 1 s t θ f y t s t θ where y t 1 y 1 y 2 y t 1 is the matrix of previous multisite precipitation amounts until time t 1 and s t s 1 s 2 s t is the vector of weather states until time t the third assumption is that the multisite daily mean precipitation amounts y t y 1 t y k t y k t are conditionally independent of each other 3 f y t s t θ k 1 k f k y k t s t θ k where f k denotes the state dependent distribution of the component y k t at station k and θ k denotes the parameter set of the state dependent distribution f k 2 3 1 2 nonhomogeneous hidden markov model nhmm the nonhomogeneous hidden markov model nhmm is an extended version of the hidden markov model charles et al 1999 fu et al 2013 guo et al 2019 holsclaw et al 2017 2016 hughes et al 1999 hughes and guttorp 1994a 1994b the nhmm allows some of its parameters to depend on several covariates such as parameters of the state transition probability matrix or the state dependent distributions or even both which not only allows the nhmm to be used as a downscaling method but also could account for the nonstationary characteristics of precipitation under climate change holsclaw et al 2017 consider a covariates x t x 1 t x 2 t x a t at time t in the state transition probability matrix which allows for seasonal variability in the wet dry state transition processes for example woolhiser and pegram 1979 and zucchini et al 2017 incorporated seasonal effects into the wet dry state transition processes by a finite fourier series the time varying state transition probabilities can be modeled via a multinomial logistic link function 4 p s t s t 1 x t φ exp α 0 i j x t α j m 1 m exp α 0 i m x t α m where i j 1 2 m denote certain weather states for notational convenience we let φ α 0 i j α j represents the parameter set of the state transition probability matrix consider b covariates w k t w 1 k t w 2 k t w b k t in the state dependent distribution f k t at station k and at time t by a generalized linear model glm through a probit link function 5 f k t y k t s t w k t θ k s t ϕ 0 k t δ 0 y k t ϕ 1 k t d k s t y k t λ k s t and 6 ϕ k t g 1 β 0 k s t w k t β k where f k t denotes the state dependent distribution of the component y k t at station k and at time t the delta function δ 0 at zero allows zero inflation on dry days and a probability distribution function d k s t is used for describing daily mean precipitation amounts on wet days the probability distribution function d k s t may be a single distribution or a mixed distribution depending on distribution s performance and physical significance in different study areas the mixing probabilities ϕ k t ϕ 0 k t ϕ 1 k t ϕ 0 k t ϕ 1 k t 1 are assumed to be dependent on the b covariates w k t w 1 k t w 2 k t w b k t which allows the state dependent distribution f k t to be time varying in the bayesian framework the gibbs sampling algorithm relies on the probit form of the ordered multinomial which means the distributions δ 0 and d k s t in the nhmm are ordered dry and wet respectively θ k s t β 0 k s t β k λ k s t is the parameter set of the state dependent distribution f k t which depends on the weather state s t at current time t it is noteworthy that the three assumptions of the hmm remain in the nhmm the first assumption is referred to the case of the first order markov chain if necessary the markov chain could be easily extended to a higher order the second assumption i e the multisite daily mean precipitation amounts are series independent and conditionally independent of previous weather states implies the nhmm may underestimate the temporal autocorrelation of actual precipitation amounts at a single station meanwhile the third assumption i e the multisite daily mean precipitation amounts are conditionally independent of each other implies that the nhmm may underestimate the spatial cross correlations of actual multisite daily mean precipitation amounts among them holsclaw et al 2016 to make up for the deficiencies of the nhmm we incorporated the vector autoregressive var model to reproduce the spatiotemporal correlations of actual multisite daily mean precipitation amounts 2 3 2 vector autoregressive var model among multisite time series models the vector autoregressive var model is most widely used in practice due to its relative ease of implementation box et al 2008 which is suitable for modeling the spatiotemporal correlations of multisite time series processes both contemporaneously and across time lags in this study the 1 order vector autoregressive model or var 1 model is used to reproduce the spatiotemporal correlations of actual multisite daily mean precipitation amounts before using the var 1 model for reproducing the spatiotemporal correlations of actual multisite daily mean precipitation amounts we apply a probability transformation method ben alaya et al 2015 to transfer the actual intermittent precipitation processes y t y 1 t y k t y k t to normalized continuous precipitation processes z t z 1 t z k t z k t 7 z

represents the threshold for defining the wet days e g y 0 0 1 mm in this study days with mean precipitation more than y 0 are defined as wet days otherwise defined as dry days then the var 1 model is applied to the normalized continuous precipitation processes z t z 1 t z k t z k t to reproduce the spatiotemporal correlations of actual multisite daily mean precipitation amounts 8 z t ψz t 1 a t

vector of covariates in the state dependent distribution f k t at station k at time t respectively the superscript cal represents dataset in the calibration period parameter set θ φ θ s t of the nhmm can be estimated by the bayesian inference method where θ s t θ 1 s t θ k s t θ k s t denote the parameters in the state dependent distributions f t f 1 t f k t f k t the joint likelihood function of

function and ω is the entire parameter space for more detail about parameter estimation kindly refer to holsclaw et al 2016 once the parameter set θ φ θ s t of the nhmm have been estimated the state dependent distribution f k t at station k and at time t can be determined as follows 12 f k t y k t s t w k t cal θ k s t ϕ 0 k t δ 0 y k t ϕ 1 k t d k s t y k t λ k s t where d k s t represents the estimated probability distribution function on wet days ϕ 0 k t and ϕ 1 k t represent the estimated mixing probabilities then based on the estimated state dependent distribution f k t the normalized precipitation z k t cal at station k and at time t can be calculated by 13 z k t cal φ 1 d k s t y k t cal if y k t cal y 0 φ 1 r u n i f 0 ϕ 0 k t if y k t cal y 0 where d k s t represents the cumulative distribution function corresponding to the estimated probability distribution function d k s t on wet days given the weather state s t at station k ϕ 0 k t is the estimated probability for dry days finally to reproduce spatiotemporal correlations for the multisite normalized continuous precipitation processes z t cal z 1 t cal z k t cal z k t cal we have the var 1 model as 14 z t cal ψz

the same time it is possible to randomly generate simulations z t val z 1 t val z k t val z k t val with spatiotemporal correlations from the calibrated var 1 model ultimately the estimated synthetic

cumulative distribution function ϕ 0 k t is the estimated probability for dry days 2 4 model selection criteria precipitation indices and evaluation metrics 2 4 1 model selection criteria there are three types of variables or functions that need to be optimized in the nhmm including 1 state dependent distribution f k t 2 the number of daily discrete wet dry weather states m and 3 covariates x t and w k t in the state transition probability matrix and the state dependent distributions respectively following holsclaw et al 2017 two criteria are used for model selection the bayesian information

value of bic and higher value of pls represent a better result 2 4 2 precipitation indices the estimated precipitation was evaluated by calculating precipitation indices as stipulated by the eu cost action value maraun et al 2019 2015 as listed in table 3 a total of eight precipitation indices were selected including 1 mean precipitation on wet days pm 2 standard deviation of precipitation on wet days psd 3 the 99th percentile of precipitation on wet days p99th 4 the 99 9th percentile of precipitation on wet days p99 9th 5 the 99th percentile of wet spell length wsl99th 6 the 99th percentile of dry spell length dsl99th 7 lag 1 autocorrelation ac1 and 8 lag 0 cross correlations cc0 which are of interest in climate impact assessments 2 4 3 evaluation metrics to compare the performances of the downscaling methods quantitatively the root mean squared error rmse is used as evaluation metric to compare the performance of the downscaling models in reproducing precipitation characteristics in particular to compare the performance of the downscaling models in reproducing spatial cross correlations based on the euclidean distance ed we defined a spatial relative similarity srs metric as follows 17 ed k k 1 2 cc 0 est cc0 obs 2 and 18 srs min ed 1 ed where cc0 obs and cc 0 est denote observed and estimated cross correlations of daily mean precipitation for each pair of stations respectively k k 1 2 is to avoid double calculation of the correlation coefficient between any two stations based on the all simulations the minimum euclidean distance ed is denoted by min ed ed 0 the value of the srs metric lies between 0 and 1 and a value closer to 1 presents a better result 3 results 3 1 model selection the results of model selection are presented in this section including 1 state dependent distribution f k t 2 number of daily discrete wet dry weather states m and 3 covariates x t and w k t in the state transition probability matrix and the state dependent distributions respectively 3 1 1 state dependent distribution in this paper four distributions were considered for precipitation amounts on wet days including exponential exp gamma gam mixed double exponential mix2exp and mixed exponential generalized pareto mixexpp to select the most suitable distribution we compared the performance of each in reproducing the observed distribution of precipitation amounts on wet days for all 86 stations as shown in fig 5 the mixexpp distribution outperforms the other three distributions on the upper tail the results are consistent with previous studies chen and brissette 2014 hundecha et al 2009 li et al 2012 so et al 2015 which turn out that the generalized pareto gp distribution combined with the exponential exp distribution shows a good ability in modeling extreme precipitation extreme precipitation thus this paper used the optimal mixexpp distribution for wet days together with the delta function δ 0 for dry days as the state dependent distribution in the nhmm that is 19 f k t y k t s t w k t θ k s t ϕ 0 k t δ 0 y k t ϕ 1 k t exp k s t y k t γ k s t ϕ 2 k t gp k s t y k t σ k s t ξ k s t where exp k s t and gp k s t denote probability distribution functions of the exponential exp and the generalized pareto gp distribution respectively γ k s t σ k s t and ξ k s t are parameters of the mixed exponential generalized pareto mixexpp distribution the mixing probabilities ϕ k t ϕ 0 k t ϕ 1 k t ϕ 2 k t ϕ 0 k t ϕ 1 k t ϕ 2 k t 1 are assumed to be dependent on b atmospheric covariates w k t w 1 k t w 2 k t w b k t 3 1 2 number of weather states the nhmm with a different number m from 2 to 8 of weather states were fitted to the observed datasets from table 4 it can be seen that the bic reaches its minimum value and the pls reaches its maximum at m 7 fig 6 shows the probability of daily precipitation occurrence at each station for each of the seven weather states state 1 represents a low probability of precipitation occurring across the whole prb state 2 state 3 and state 4 represent a high probability of precipitation occurring over the west middle and east of the prb respectively state 5 represents a high probability of precipitation occurring over the east and a median probability of precipitation occurring over the west of the prb state 6 is the opposite of state 5 while state 7 represents a high probability of precipitation occurring over the whole prb 3 1 3 covariates 3 1 3 1 covariates in the state transition probability matrix the probability of precipitation occurrence shows significant seasonal variations as shown in fig 2 thus to incorporate seasonality into the state transition probability matrix trigonometric functions were used zucchini et al 2017 multiple sine cosine pairs can be included to model complex seasonal patterns the number of sine cosine pairs was chosen by the bic and the pls as shown in table 5 the bic reaches its minimum value and the pls reaches its maximum values when incorporating two sine cosine pairs into the state transition probability matrix 3 1 3 2 covariates in the state dependent distributions to select appropriate atmospheric covariates in the state dependent distributions of the nhmm based on the observed daily mean datasets we first calculated the pearson s correlation coefficients between the basin averaged precipitation and the nine alternative nnr based atmospheric fields as listed in table 1 at each grid the obtained correlation maps helped us to select the most relevant atmospheric factors and their spatial regions fig 7 shows the correlations between the observed daily mean precipitation over the prb and the observed daily mean atmospheric fields as seen except the zg500 not shown the other eight atmospheric fields are significantly correlated with the observed daily mean precipitation the areas marked by black dots indicate the correlations are significant at the 0 05 level to further determine the covariates in the state dependent distributions we performed the multi step leave one out validation and compared the model performances based on the bic and the pls in addition to reduce the dimensionality of the selected covariates the principal component analysis pca method was applied to the normalized atmospheric fields table 6 shows the bic and the pls of the nhmm models with different combinations of atmospheric covariates in the state dependent distributions the results indicate that a combination of hur500 hur850 ua850 and zg850 is the optimal choice ultimately the first 20 principal components of the above four normalized atmospheric fields i e hur500 hur850 ua850 and zg850 within the significant correlation areas marked by black dots in fig 7 were selected as covariates in the state dependent distributions based on the cumulative variance explained by more than 80 3 2 model validation to validate the performance of the nhmm and the nhmm var models the observed dataset from 1 january 1990 to 31 december 2014 25 years were considered as the validation set the results of estimated daily mean precipitation were compared to observed daily mean precipitation in terms of statistical properties i e pm psd p99th p99 9th wsl99th and dsl99th and spatiotemporal correlations i e ac1 and cc0 fig 8 a b shows the weekly precipitation process during the year 2014 at station no 11 and station no 69 respectively both the nhmm and the nhmm var models give probabilistic predictions thus the 95 confidence interval ci of precipitation generated from 100 simulations are presented here fig 9 a g presents the scatter plots of the seven estimated precipitation indices i e pm psd p99th p99 9th wsl99th dsl99th and ac1 by the two models nhmm and nhmm var against those of the observed results for all 86 stations q q plot of the estimated wet spell length wsl and dry spell length dsl by the two models nhmm and nhmm var against those of the observed results at station no 11 and station no 69 during the validation period are presented in fig s1 supplementary fig 10 a c presents the lag 0 cross correlations cc0 of daily mean precipitation for the 86 86 pairs of stations quantitatively table 7 shows the rmse and srs of the precipitation indices between the observed and the two modeled nhmm estimated and nhmm var estimated precipitation the two metrics rmse and srs are calculated from the median precipitation indices of 100 simulations the results from fig 9 a d and table 7 indicate that the mixexpp distribution assumed in the nhmm and nhmm var models is able to accurately capture the four statistical properties i e pm psd p99th and p99 9th of daily mean precipitation on wet days since the points are close to the 1 1 line specifically in terms of the pm and the p99th the nhmm var model slightly outperforms the nhmm since it obtains lower rmses however in terms of the psd and the p99 9th the nhmm var model is slightly worse than the nhmm since it obtains higher rmses the wet and dry spells represent the persistence in the precipitation occurrence process and have a great significance in hydrology agriculture and water resources management li and babovic 2019 the results from fig 9 e f and table 7 show that the nhmm var model is slightly better than the nhmm in terms of reproducing wet spell length wsl and dry spell length dsl however there is still an underestimation of the wsl99th and the dsl99th which indicates the first order markov chains assumed in the nhmm may be inadequate to model complex wet dry spells subsequent research should develop models to improve the accuracy of precipitation occurrence simulation for example higher order markov chains wilks 1999 or more appropriate covariates in the state transition matrix of the nhmm may be considered lag 1 temporal autocorrelation ac1 represents the short term persistence in the precipitation process li and babovic 2019 as expected fig 9 g and table 7 show that the nhmm var model outperforms the nhmm in reproducing the ac1 since it obtains the lower rmse however there is still an underestimation of the ac1 the reason may be that the precipitation occurrence is not faultlessly reproduced by the first order markov chains and the temporal autocorrelation was weakened when using the inverse cumulative distribution function to transfer the normalized continuous precipitation processes to the synthetic precipitation series as shown in equation 16 but anyway the above results show that the var model does add value to the nhmm downscaling method in reproducing the temporal autocorrelation in terms of the lag 0 cross correlations cc0 the results from fig 10 show that the nhmm var model evidently outperforms the nhmm since the nhmm var estimated cc0 has a more similar pattern to that of observed quantitatively table 7 further indicates that the nhmm var model is better since the nhmm var model obtains a higher srs with a value of 0 83 than the nhmm with a srs value of 0 62 this result is not unexpected since the nhmm does not consider the spatial cross correlations of multisite precipitation amounts indeed in its model structure though the presence of the m discrete weather states in the nhmm ensures that some degree of spatial dependence across stations is captured via the weather states holsclaw et al 2016 the spatial dependence is not directed at the precipitation processes the results prove that the var model does add value to the nhmm downscaling method in reproducing the spatial correlations 3 3 comparison of downscaling performances between nhmm and nhmm var in this section we compare downscaling performances between nhmm and nhmm var based on eight gcms datasets during the entire period from 1 january 1960 to 31 december 2014 to eliminate systematic bias existing in gcm estimated atmospheric fields the combined atmospheric fields from gcms were projected onto the 20 nnr based principal components structures as stated in section 3 1 3 the obtained 20 principal components were then used in nhmm and nhmm var models to perform downscaling modeling 3 3 1 statistical properties figs 11 13 present the scatter plots of the estimated precipitation indices i e pm p99th and wsl99th by the three models raw gcm nhmm and nhmm var against those of the observed results for all 86 stations scatter plots of more precipitation indices i e psd p99 9th and dsl99th are presented in figs s2 s4 in terms of the four statistical properties i e pm psd p99th and p99 9th figs 11 12 and figs s2 s3 indicate that both the nhmm and the nhmm var models show great improvement compared to the raw gcms except for the canesm5 the nhmm var model is slightly better than the nhmm in terms of the pm and the p99th but slightly worse in terms of the psd and the p99 9th which are consistent with the results during the validation period as shown in section 3 2 in terms of the wsl99th and the dsl99th as can be seen from fig 13 and fig s4 all raw gcms show significant overestimation of the wsl99th and underestimation of the dsl99th and both the nhmm and the nhmm var models show great improvement compared to the raw gcms the nhmm var model is slightly better than the nhmm in terms of reproducing the wsl99th for the bcc csm2 mr canesm5 cnrm cm6 1 miroc6 mri esm2 0 and noresm2 lm in addition both the nhmm and the nhmm var models show satisfying results in terms of reproducing the wsl99th for the fgoals g3 and ipsl cm6a lr however there is almost no difference between the nhmm and the nhmm var models in terms of reproducing the dsl99th 3 3 2 spatiotemporal correlations fig 14 presents the estimated ac1 by the three models raw gcm nhmm and nhmm var against that of the observed results for all 86 stations as seen the nhmm var model outperforms the nhmm in reproducing the temporal autocorrelation of precipitation for all eight gcms since most of the points of the nhmm var model are closer to the 1 1 line in terms of the lag 0 cross correlations cc0 here take the ipsl cm6a lr as an example other gcms have similar results fig 15 shows that the raw gcm overestimates the cc0 of actual multisite daily mean precipitation amounts and the nhmm generally underestimates the spatial cross correlations of actual multisite daily mean precipitation amounts for most of the stations the nhmm var model could reproduce the spatial cross correlations of actual multisite daily mean precipitation amounts more effectively since the nhmm var estimated cc0 has more similar patterns to the observed cc0 on the other hand from table 8 it is evident that the nhmm var model outperforms the nhmm in terms of srs with values from 0 64 to 0 71 higher than that of the nhmm with values of approximately 0 57 the raw gcms obtain the smallest srs with values from 0 26 to 0 29 4 discussions 4 1 comparison of multi source uncertainties to systematically evaluate the magnitude of multi source uncertainties as well as the relative contributions to the total uncertainty of the estimated synthetic precipitation this paper quantified the three uncertainty sources i e the gcm datasets parameters of the nhmm var model and the interaction between both of them using the anova method ma et al 2018b 2018a fig 16 shows the relative contribution of three uncertainty components i e gcm datasets parameters of the nhmm var model and interaction between both of them to the total uncertainty for the estimated precipitation as can be seen that both the gcm datasets and the parameters of the nhmm var model contribute to total uncertainty at a lower proportion with percentage values of approximately 10 20 and 10 respectively furthermore it is visible that the uncertainty generated from the interaction between both of them is dominated in magnitude and contributes the greatest proportion of total uncertainty with percentage values ranging from 70 to 80 the results indicate that we should pay attention to the comprehensive analysis of uncertainty sources especially the interaction between several individual uncertainty sources 4 2 comparison of downscaling performances with raw and bias corrected covariates of gcm in this section we compare downscaling performances of the nhmm var models based on raw gcm estimated covariates and bias corrected covariates a detailed discussion about such an issue is necessary since the bias existing in the gcm estimated covariates will be transferred to the final estimated synthetic precipitation fig 17 a d shows the scatter plots of the four estimated precipitation indices i e pm p99th dsl99th and ac1 by the three models raw gcm nhmm var with raw covariates and nhmm var with bias corrected covariates against those of the observed results for all 86 stations scatter plots of more precipitation indices i e psd p99 9th and dsl99th are presented in figs s5 s7 the results indicate that the nhmm var model with raw gcm estimated covariates overestimates the statistical properties of precipitation including pm psd p99th and p99 9th but in terms of the wsl99th dsl99th and ac1 the nhmm var model with raw gcm estimated covariates obtains a similar result to the nhmm var model with bias corrected covariates in terms of the cc0 fig 18 a d indicates that the nhmm var model with raw gcm estimated covariates underestimates the spatial cross correlation and shows poor performance than the nhmm var model with bias corrected covariates the above results prove that correcting the bias existing in the gcm estimated covariates is indeed necessary before applying them in the downscaling application 5 conclusions this study developed an effective nonhomogeneous hidden markov model vector autoregressive nhmm var model for downscaling the gcm estimated large scale atmospheric circulation fields to ground multisite precipitation in the nhmm var model the nhmm is used to determine the probabilities for dry days and marginal distributions of multisite daily mean precipitation amounts on wet days based on several gcm estimated covariates then a var 1 model is used to reproduce the spatiotemporal correlations i e temporal autocorrelation and spatial cross correlations of actual multisite daily mean precipitation amounts simultaneously the performances of the nhmm var model were demonstrated by comparing with the original nhmm the following main conclusions can be drawn 1 both the nhmm and nhmm var models perform well in terms of modeling the statistical properties of precipitation i e occurrence and distributions characteristics 2 the nhmm var model outperforms the nhmm with respect to reproducing the spatiotemporal correlations of actual multisite daily mean precipitation amounts this indicates that the var model does add value to the nhmm downscaling method 3 compared to the two individual uncertainty sources i e the gcm datasets and parameters of the nhmm var model of the estimated synthetic precipitation the uncertainty generated from the interaction between both of the two individual uncertainty sources contributes the greatest proportion of total uncertainty with percentage values ranging from 70 to 80 4 correcting the bias existing in the gcm estimated covariates is indeed necessary before applying them in the downscaling application since the nhmm var model with the raw gcm estimated covariates shows poor performance than the nhmm var model with bias corrected covariates overall the developed nhmm var model is a competitive methodology for downscaling the gcm estimated large scale atmospheric circulation fields to ground multisite precipitation credit authorship contribution statement xini zha methodology investigation formal analysis writing original

3192,understanding the response mechanism of vegetation growth to hydro meteorological events is essential at the global or regional scales especially in context of global warming and anthropogenic interventions previous studies have focused mainly on the responses of vegetation vulnerability to single drought or flood extremes but rarely on those of drought flood abrupt alternation i e coexistence and rapid transformation of drought and flood dfaa events on vegetation growth here this study proposed a binary copula evaluation model to quantitatively explore the internal mechanism of vegetation activity response to dfaa events flood to drought ftd and drought to flood dtf from probabilistic perspective the wei river basin wrb the largest tributary of the yellow river was selected as a case study normalized difference vegetation index ndvi was used as a proxy to reveal the spatial temporal dynamics of vegetation coverage then the response time of vegetation vitality to spring summer and summer autumn dfaa events was diagnosed finally the conditional possibility of different vegetation states under dfaa stress was examined results showed that 1 the lag time of optional vegetation response to dfaa events was more than 4 months 2 ftd and dtf showed drought flood synergism and antagonism by strengthening and weakening single stress respectively and 3 the jing river basin is an ftd sensitive area whereas as a summer autumn dtf compensatory area the decision makers should control the stress degree of the upper of the wrb to have a favorable impact on vegetation generally this study sheds new insights into vegetation response to dfaa events which provides effective theoretical support for decision makers to formulate effective strategies for dfaa mitigation and sustainable development of ecosystems keywords synergistic and antagonistic effects copula function response time conditional probability vegetation vitality 1 introduction as one of the world s most serious costly and widespread meteorological disasters han et al 2021a drought flood is a complex natural phenomenon caused by insufficient excessive precipitation compared to the long term recorded averages which can lead to large threats to human society agricultural production ecosystems and water resources jiang et al 2019 drought flood abrupt alternation dfaa events within a certain region or basin is a new type of extreme hydrological event caused by coexistence and rapid alternation of drought and flood liu et al 2018a therefore it is a special performance of short term extreme precipitation anomaly which mainly includes drought to flood dtf and flood to drought ftd events dfaa events can cause more serious disasters than a single drought or flood event resulting in greater casualties and economic losses bi et al 2022 affected by abnormal atmospheric and oceanic circulation global climate change and human activities miao et al 2022 previous studies worldwide have shown that the spatial distribution of dfaa events is expanding and their frequency and intensity tend to increase cheng et al 2012 ma et al 2019 it was revealed that the rice yield ratio decreased by 30 3 under the stress of dfaa events xiong et al 2019 thus revealing the evolution of extreme dfaa events in changing environments understanding their potential driving mechanism and assessing the impact mechanism of dfaa events have been attracted increasing attention from academic communities various methods have been proposed to identify dfaa events including long cycle drought flood abrupt transition index ldfai yang et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 standardized precipitation index liu et al 2019 and standard weighted average precipitation index zhao et al 2020b among them ldfai considers the difference of precipitation and has a simple calculation process which lays a foundation for revealing the dynamics and physical causes of dfaa shan et al 2018 in addition it is appropriate to analyze dfaa events with ldfai which has been widely used at present bi et al 2021 liu et al 2019 to better understand how and why dfaa events change numerous studies nowadays have attempted to investigate their possible causes generally these studies focus on the relationship between dfaa events and hydroclimatic elements and atmospheric circulation such as vapor pressure precipitation temperature sunshine duration and el niño southern oscillation shan et al 2018 shi et al 2021 for example yang et al 2022 analyzed the characteristics of dfaa events in the yangtze river basin yrb based on ldfai and revealed the forces driving dfaa by combining relevant meteorological factors and teleconnection factors zhao et al 2020b found dfaa events of the hanjiang basin are likely to be more frequent and their intensity will increase significantly in the 21st century analyzing the dfaa events and intra seasonal oscillation in the mid high latitude meridional circulation of the upper troposphere over east asia yang et al 2013 found that significant differences in atmospheric circulation and water transport vapor flux were the main causes of dfaa events in the middle and lower reaches of the yrb in 2011 besides these aspects it is worth mentioning that the effects of dfaa events have been extensively revealed recently in different parts of the world for instance under the stress of the dfaa events the reactive oxygen species photosynthetic metabolism and energy metabolism pathway reaction of rice had strongly changed which led to the decrease of rice yield xiong et al 2019 bi et al 2019 investigated the dfaa events effects on leaf area index root system grain quality and yield in the field and the results showed that dfaa events had different effects on the growth of summer maize at the tasseling grain filling stage and seeding jointing stage however given that dfaa events are a more complex phenomenon the above studies on the influencing mechanism of dfaa events have focused on specific growth periods hence it is difficult to reveal the global rules of the effects of dfaa events on crop yield physiological characteristics and terrestrial ecosystem at different spatiotemporal scales the terrestrial ecosystem plays a key role in global ecological environment evolution climate change hydrological cycle and sustainable development of humans and nature ak et al 2020 piao et al 2014 vegetation coverage is an important component that reflects the ecological environmental change and the main vegetation pattern in an area is the result of the long term interaction between water landforms soil human activities and the atmosphere vegetation quantity quality and type are inevitably affected by solar radiation temperature precipitation and other factors and are extremely sensitive to climate change likewise as a vital indicator of ecosystem vulnerability vegetation can effectively feedback regional climate change dong et al 2021 currently the dynamic evolution of vegetation and its underlying response mechanisms to climate factors have gradually become the research focus the dfaa event is a new water stress phenomenon that makes vegetation change rapidly in two states of water deficit and surplus moreover there may be a superposition effect of dfaa events on a plant that is alternating stress could induce the physiological status of vegetation to appear synergistic or antagonistic characteristics which may weaken or strengthen the resistance of vegetation to dfaa events dong et al 2021 guo et al 2013 therefore a quantitative and visual assessment of the impact of dfaa events including synergistic and antagonistic effects on vegetation in climate change is a difficult task to maintain ecosystem stability and sustainable development of society and economy meanwhile as a prerequisite to clarify the climate ecosystem relationship quantifying the impact of extreme climate i e drought heatwave and compound dry hot on vegetation under global warming is critical recently numerous studies have been devoted to understanding how vegetation responds to extremes for instance with the development of statistical methods liu et al 2018b employed a first order autoregressive model and multiple linear regression model to confirm the length of the water memory effect and reveal the contribution of previous precipitation to current vegetation ceglar et al 2018 constructed a combined stress index based on summer drought stress and temperature stress to predict maize yields in europe however these studies are limited to using deterministic approaches to reveal the effects of extreme weather thus ignoring the complicated interaction of climate factors and vegetation responses in general uncertainty assessment based on the copula model is a promising way which has been widely applied for exploring the responses of vegetation to extreme climate conditions at regional and global scales due to its flexible analysis of multi variable joint probability period for example fang et al 2019b systematically assessed the likelihood of vegetation degradation to different drought levels moderate severe and extreme using copula conditional probability framework and identified the drought vulnerable areas in mainland china in addition this assessment model can also predict the probability distribution of vegetation degradation induced by specific disaster conditions fang et al 2019a fang et al 2019b which is of great significance for disaster mitigation however the probabilistic assessments of the compensation and reduction effects of dfaa events on vegetation are still lacking in addition besides dfaa events vegetation may be influenced by other cooccurring factors such as high temperatures and wind speeds making it challenging to isolate the role of dfaa in large regions therefore it is crucial to assess the impact of dfaa in a probabilistic manner it is well known that normalized difference vegetation index ndvi is currently considered to be the best indicator for monitoring vegetation growth and ecological environment as well as an effective indicator of inverting changes in surface vegetation coverage zhe and zhang 2021 zhu et al 2020 therefore ndvi is widely used to monitor vegetation dynamics and its response to ecological factors such as climate human activities and land use previous studies have found that obvious time lag effects may exist between extreme climate and vegetation growth that is vegetation growth is affected not only by simultaneous climatic factors but also by the cumulative effect of past climate conditions ding et al 2020 kong et al 2020 zhao et al 2020a this suggests that vegetation growth may respond to climate only when climate change exceeds the resistance of vegetation braswell et al 1997 kong et al 2018 tei et al 2017 therefore the main challenge of exploring the vulnerability of the terrestrial ecological environment is to calculate the lag effect of vegetation on global climate in this study a quantitative assessment framework was proposed to determine the superimposed effects of dfaa events on terrestrial ecosystems generally the main objectives are to 1 determine the response time of vegetation to spring summer and summer autumn dfaa events 2 identify dependence between vegetation vitality and dfaa events 3 evaluate synergistic and antagonistic effects of dtf and dft conditions on terrestrial ecosystems from a probability perspective results may improve our understanding of vegetation resistance to dfaa events will also provide a reference for researchers and decision makers to guide water resources management 2 study area and datasets 2 1 study area the wei river basin wrb is located in a semi arid and semi humid climate region which is one of the main sand transport sources of the yellow river basin it 103 5 110 5e 33 5 37 5 n flows through gansu ningxia and shaanxi provinces autonomous regions from west to east with a total length of 818 km and a watershed area of 13 48 104 km2 of which gansu ningxia and shaanxi account for 44 1 6 1 and 48 9 respectively the wrb has two tributaries namely the beiluo river basin blr and jing river basin jrb the area has a continental monsoon climate with annual potential evapotranspiration between 800 1000 mm and means annual precipitation in the range of 400 800 mm spatially precipitation has an increasing trend from north to south and precipitation in river valleys is lower than that in mountainous area the annual mean temperature of the wrb is between 7 8 and 13 5 with maximum and minimum temperatures of 42 8 and 28 1 respectively zhang et al 2021 according to the main reach and the tributaries this study selected upper reaches of the wrb uwrb middle lower reaches of the wrb mlwrb jrb and blr which divided the study area into four regions fig 1 a there are great spatial differences in geomorphic characteristics of the wrb with the loess plateau in the north plain in the middle and the qinling mountains in the south therefore there is severe soil erosion in this basin the terrain is high in the west and low in the east with an average elevation of 1300 m the primary land cover types in the wrb were cropland grassland and forest accounting for 41 3 38 0 and 16 5 in 2013 https www resdc cn data aspx dataid 263 respectively fig 1 b the main vegetation types in the northern part of the basin are grassland and shrub in the southern part under the global warming the wrb has become one of the most ecologically vulnerable areas in china due to the frequent climate disasters such as ecological environment degradation and river siltation 2 2 data sources normalized difference vegetation index ndvi also known as standardized vegetation index was first proposed by rouse schell 1973 ndvi can strongly reflect the physical mechanism of vegetation growth that is the difference between chlorophyll absorption in the red band and green scattering in the near infrared band gimms ndvi 3g spot ndvi and modis ndvi mod13 and myd13 are the most widely used vegetation index datasets among them the gimms ndvi 3g dataset presently is the global continuous ndvi dataset with the longest coverage time which is provided by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa https ecocast arc nasa gov data pub gimms 3g v1 in addition the ndvi 3g dataset can eliminate the errors caused by atmospheric conditions orbital drift and volcanic eruption through a series of pretreatments its quality is superior to other ndvi datasets so it is widely used to monitor long term trends in vegetation activity at regional and global scales in this study the gimms ndvi 3g dataset from 1982 to 2013 was selected with a spatial resolution of 1 12 and a 15 day interval firstly the 15 day ndvi 3g data was processed into monthly ndvi data using the maximum synthesis method secondly the monthly ndvi 3g dataset was converted into geotiff based on the vector boundary of the wrb monthly gimms ndvi raster dataset from 1982 to 2013 were extracted meteorological data are monthly precipitation data of 21 stations in the wrb from 1982 to 2013 which were obtained from china meteorological service center http data cma cn and have gone through the quality control fig 1 a 3 methodologies based on the historical data of the wrb a binary conditional probabilistic evaluation framework was established to quantify the impact of drought flood abrupt alternation dfaa on terrestrial ecosystems the probabilistic distribution characteristics of vegetation under the synergistic and antagonistic effects of drought flood were analyzed the evaluation process was shown in fig 2 3 1 long cycle drought flood abrupt transition index the time scale of spring summer march august and summer autumn june november dfaa defined in this study is 3 months seasonal scale namely spring summer is drought and summer autumn is flood known as spring summer summer autumn drought to flood dtf and vice versa the dfaa phenomenon of spring summer and summer autumn was described quantitatively in this study using a long cycle drought flood abrupt transition index ldfai which was defined according to the study by wu et al 2006 as follows 1 ldfai r j r i r i r j 1 8 r i r j where r i and r j are the standardized precipitation in spring summer and summer autumn respectively r j r i denotes the intensity of dfaa events r i r j represents drought and flood intensity term 1 8 r i r j is the weight coefficient which could reduce the weight of pure drought or flood events and increase the weight of dfaa events it should be noted that ldfai less than 1 represents the flood to drought ftd events while ldfai greater than 1 represents the dtf events shi et al 2021 the larger the absolute value of ldfai the severer the dfaa events are zhang et al 2019 2 r s p s p σ where ps s i j is the accumulated precipitation during the season p and σ are the long term mean and standard deviation of ps respectively 3 2 determination of vegetation response time to dfaa events this study measured the correlation between spring summer and summer autumn ldfai series spanning 1982 2013 and ndvi series with various lag periods to reveal response time of vegetation to spring summer and summer autumn dfaa events although some studies found that the lag time of vegetation growth to climate factors should be less than 4 months detsch et al 2016 wang et al 2021 studies on vegetation ecology also showed that the lag response time may be more than 4 months zhu 2019 therefore the longest lag scale of vegetation growth on spring summer and summer autumn dfaa events selected in this study was 16 and 13 months respectively moreover the mean of ndvi on a time scale of 1 to 6 months was also considered the pearson correlation method was used between spring summer and summer autumn ldfai and ndvi series at different lag periods t k i as follows 3 r t k i s c o r r l d f a i s n d v i t k i where r is correlation coefficient s spring summer or summer autumn t c or l indicating the corresponding period or lag k is 1 6 namely k 6 represents the mean value of ndvi at the 6 month scale i represents the number of simultaneous or lag months and is desirable 1 16 for instance r c 6 1 s p r i n g s u m m e r is the pearson correlation coefficient between spring summer ldfai series and average ndvi in the same period from march to august 6 month finally the lag period t k i corresponding to the maximum absolute value of the correlation coefficient between ndvi and spring summer summer autumn ldfai is the optimal response time ort of vegetation to dfaa events 4 or t s max corr l d f a i s n d v i t k i 3 3 copula conditional probability framework copula function can effectively describe the dependence of random variables including linear nonlinear symmetric and asymmetric relations and retain the correlation information of variables completely bhatti and hung quang 2019 at present this theory has become an effective tool to deal with hydrometeorological multi variable dependence relationship and flexibly construct its joint distribution function and has been widely used in the research of extreme events such as flood drought and rainstorms li et al 2020 mortuza et al 2019 tosunoglu et al 2020 xiao et al 2019 in this study the bivariate conditional probability framework of copula function was used to quantitatively reveal changes of vegetation activity under dfaa events stress and the specific steps are as follows 3 3 1 determination of marginal distribution the premise of constructing a copula function is to determine the marginal distribution function of random variables exponential distribution exp gamma distribution gamma normal distribution normal generalized pareto distribution gpd and generalized extreme value distribution gev are widely used marginal distribution functions at present khan et al 2021 tahroudi et al 2020 therefore the above five alternative distributions were selected in this study to fit the ndvi time series respectively considering the positive and negative nature of the ldfai time series only normal and gev meet the requirements moreover the non parametric kernel density estimation method can reproduce and retain the attributes and a series of features contained in the sample observation value lall 2012 sharma 2000 which was further applied to fit the ldfai series finally the optimal marginal distribution function of ndvi and ldfai sequences was evaluated based on the kolmogorov smirnov k s test and the minimum root means square error rmse criterion han et al 2021b 3 3 2 determination of joint distribution assuming that the marginal distribution functions of ndvi and ldfai series are u f ldfai l d f a i and v f ndvi n d v i respectively and their joint distribution function is f ldfai n d v

functions of ndvi and ldfai series were calculated based on the optimal marginal distribution and clayton copula frank copula gumbel copula gaussian copula and student s t copula were selected as alternative joint distribution functions to fit ndvi and ldfai variables the ordinary linear square ols criterion was used to optimize copula function shi et al 2020 3 3 3 describing vegetation response to dfaa events in this study the superposition effects of dfaa events on vegetation were considered including drought flood combination and drought flood antagonism firstly vegetation loss probabilities under dtf and ftd events stress were considered to reflect the synergistic effect of drought flood four vegetation loss scenarios were determined using the percentile method to reveal the probability of vegetation loss of different degrees induced by specific stress including ndvi at the 10th 20th 30th and 40th quantiles the specific formula is as follows under dtf events stress 6

and discussion 4 1 vegetation patterns and dynamics 4 1 1 temporal variation characteristics of ndvi there is a significant positive correlation between ecosystem parameters biomass and vegetation coverage and ndvi data namely the higher the ndvi value the higher the vegetation coverage based on this firstly the monthly gims ndvi data of each grid of the wrb spanning 1982 2013 were extracted using the maximum synthesis method secondly monthly ndvi values of four sub regions were calculated by the mean value method finally the interannual variation of the ndvi series was revealed to fully reflect the temporal pattern of vegetation coverage as can be seen from fig 3 the linear trend slopes of ndvi in the uwrb mlwrb jrb and blr were all greater than 0 indicating that vegetation vitality has been enhanced in this period except for the mlwrb the ndvi of other sub regions showed an obvious trend of increasing fluctuation after 2000 indicating that the vegetation coverage rate in these regions during 2000 2013 was significantly higher than that from 1982 to 1999 the implement of environmental management and ecological restoration projects since 1999 such as returning farmland to forest and grassland natural forest protection artificial afforestation and large areas of sea buckthorn were planted however this plant is prone to widespread death due to its strict requirement for precipitation since then more adaptable pinus tabuliformis and pinus sylvestris were planted to change the environmental conditions for vegetation growth and improve vegetation coverage and productivity therefore ndvi increased rapidly and showed a trend of fluctuation after 2000 indicating that the variation trend of ndvi in the wrb confirmed the actual situation of the region 4 1 2 spatial variation characteristics of ndvi taking the time series of ndvi as the mean of all pixels in the wrb can only reflect the overall pattern of vegetation change and cannot clearly describe the spatial difference of vegetation coverage change therefore this study used the monthly ndvi data of each pixel to calculate the multi year average ndvi dataset to explore the spatial pattern of vegetation coverage as can be seen from the legend color band the darker the color is the higher the ndvi value is indicating the higher vegetation coverage on the contrary the lighter the color is poor vegetation vitality which may be exposed land construction land and lake fig 4 showed that there were obvious spatial differences in ndvi of the wrb during 1982 2013 in general ndvi showed an increasing trend from northwest to southeast indicating that vegetation coverage in the southeast was better than that in the northwest a possible reason is that precipitation in the southeast of the wrb is more than that in the northwest and more precipitation is conducive to promoting vegetation growth resulting in higher vegetation vitality in the southeast the low value area of ndvi is mainly distributed in the uwrb and upper reaches of the jrb and blr the proportion of grassland and agricultural land in the uwrb is high which is heavily dependent on precipitation however this region belongs to a semi arid area so the lack of water resources leads to low vegetation coverage in the region the xifeng and zhengning located in the middle of jrb are subordinate to the qingyang their rich oil reserves and coal resources have rapidly promoted the development of urbanization and population growth which occupy vegetation areas and lead to vegetation degradation it is worth noting that the mlwrb has sporadic ndvi low value areas such as xi an baoji and xianyang as these regions are rich in natural resources their economy has rapidly developed and industry occupies a high proportion in economic structure in addition urban expansion constantly grabs farmland resulting in low vegetation coverage in the region 4 2 response time of ndvi to dfaa events the pearson correlation coefficient between spring summer summer autumn ldfai series and ndvi series with different lag periods was measured in four sub regions of the wrb fig 5 and figs s1 s3 showed the pearson correlation coefficients between spring summer ldfai and ndvi series with various lag time in the uwrb mlwrb jrb and blr respectively overall ldfai was positively correlated with ndvi indicating that vegetation coverage in the wrb magnified with the increase of spring summer ldfai namely compared with ftd events dtf events had a better consistency with vegetation growth in the uwrb the maximum correlation coefficient between ldfai and ndvi l 2 13 was 0 33 indicating that the response time of vegetation cover to dfaa events in the spring summer season was l 2 13 fig 5 similarly the correlation between ldfai and ndvi l 3 9 ndvi l 1 7 and ndvi l 1 7 in spring summer was the strongest in the mlwrb jrb and blr which were 0 35 p 0 05 0 48 p 0 01 and 0 42 p 0 05 thus the optimal response times of vegetation coverage to dfaa events in these sub regions were l 3 9 l 1 7 and l 1 7 respectively at the same time the effect of dfaa events on vegetation coverage was the greatest in the jrb followed by the blr and the least in the uwrb to similar the spring summer season ldfai and ndvi of study areas showed a positive correlation in the summer autumn fig 6 and figs s4 s6 in particular except for the mlwrb fig s4 and jrb fig s5 ldfai and ndvi are positively correlated with the increase of lag time to some extent response time can reflect the resistance of vegetation to dfaa events namely the longer lag response time the stronger the resistance of vegetation hence vegetation in the uwrb and blr could resist dtf events for a longer time moreover ndvi l 3 5 ndvi c 4 1 ndvi l 4 5 and ndvi l 2 7 had the strongest correlation with summer autumn ldfai series in the uwrb mlwrb jrb and blr and the correlation coefficient was 0 48 p 0 01 0 38 p 0 05 0 51 p 0 01 and 0 32 namely the optimal response times of vegetation coverage to dfaa events were l 3 5 c 4 1 l 4 5 and l 2 7 respectively meanwhile it also seemed to be seen that vegetation in the mlwrb can respond to dfaa events in a relatively short period fig s4 in brief the response of vegetation to dfaa events has a certain lag effect and the lag time was more than 4 months a series of studies have shown that vegetation in semi arid and sub humid regions has a longer response time to water than in arid and humid regions pasho et al 2011 vicente serrano et al 2013 the essential reason is that the ecosystem in this region is often stressed by the rapid transition between water deficit and redundancy and gradually evolved adaptive mechanisms to withstand the alternating stress in addition the response time of ndvi to dfaa events in the summer autumn season was significantly shorter than that in the spring summer season 4 3 responses of vegetation to dfaa stress 4 3 1 optimization of the marginal and joint distribution after determining the response time of ndvi in the wrb to dfaa events in spring summer and summer autumn the ndvi series corresponding to the response time and ldfai characteristic variables were fitted using the alternative marginal distribution proposed in section 3 3 1 respectively k s test and minimum rmse were used to determine the optimal marginal distribution function of each variable and the results were shown in table 1 based on the optimal marginal distribution of each series table 1 clayton copula frank copula gumbel copula gaussian copula and student s t copula were selected to construct joint distribution functions of ldfai and ndvi respectively the goodness of fitting test of each alternative distribution was calculated that is and the minimum ols were used as the criterion to select the optimal joint distribution table 2 as can be seen from table 2 ols of t copula and gumbel copula are the smallest among the five alternative distributions in the uwrb and jrb so they were selected as the joint distribution function of ndvi and ldfai of spring summer and summer autumn respectively frank copula and clayton copula have the best fitting degree in the mlwrb gumbel copula and t copula have the minimum ols in the fitting process of ndvi with spring summer and summer autumn ldfai in the blr and the fitting effect is the best 4 3 2 conditional probability of vegetation falling into the lower percentiles based on the four planting loss scenarios defined in section 3 3 3 10th 20th 30th and 40th percentiles the vegetation loss probability corresponding to the four scenarios under ftd and dtf stress was calculated to quantitatively reveal the combined impact of dfaa events on vegetation coverage according to eqs 6 7 respectively it can be seen from figs 7 and 8 that the probability of vegetation loss in the four sub regions of the wrb is higher under the stress of ftd events indicating that vegetation vitality in the study area is more sensitive to ftd events which is consistent with the conclusion in section 4 2 namely to ftd events since early flood events may inhibit vegetation photosynthesis by affecting the sunshine duration and solar radiation which could reduce vegetation coverage simultaneously vegetation may respond to prophase precipitation in a short time due to plant interception and slow soil infiltration during late drought however vegetation growth is closely related to soil water content continuous drought events may lead to insufficient soil water supply which further inhibits vegetation growth in addition when the flood stress is rapidly transformed into drought stress the later drought may enhance the adverse effects of the earlier flood conditions on vegetation by affecting photosynthesis and the accumulation distribution and transfer of dry matter in plants on the temporal scale under the stress of spring summer dfaa events the probability of loss at different vegetation statuses in the four sub regions of the wrb was generally higher than that in summer autumn indicating that vegetation growth in the study area was more sensitive to dfaa events in spring summer section 4 2 showed that ndvi has a longer response time to spring summer dfaa events compared with summer autumn so the resistance of vegetation to spring summer dfaa events has gradually decreased resulting in greater vegetation loss in addition as spring is the green season for crops and other plants drought or flood events in this season will seriously affect the photosynthesis of vegetation which could inhibit vegetation growth on the contrary when dfaa events occur in summer autumn vegetation has entered the mature stage and its growth is relatively stable so vegetation has a strong ability to resist dfaa events based on the analysis of the conditional probability of vegetation vigor below specific quantiles i e 10th 20th 30th and 40th in the uwrb mlwrb jrb and blr vulnerable areas of ecosystems under dfaa stress can be effectively identified from a spatial perspective as illustrated in figs 7 8 there was significant spatial heterogeneity in vegetation probability specifically a higher probability loss of ndvi at 10th 20th 30th and 40th percentiles was monitored in the jrb when suffering from ftd stress it seemed to be obvious that the vegetation in the jrb was highly sensitive to ftd events as a water limited area the jrb was dominated by grassland and lower root systems reduced the ability of vegetation to conserve water resulting in lower resistance to the late stage drought of ftd stress the previous study has also verified the reliability of this result that is frequent droughts have led to large scale degradation of temperate grasslands in northern china which has forced ecosystem functions to deteriorate luo et al 2021 it was also detected that a larger probability of vegetation vitality below 10th 20th 30th and 40th quantiles when the uwrb experienced spring summer dtf situation was 0 11 0 19 0 24 and 0 30 therefore it can be inferred that this region is prone to ecological degradation when spring summer dtf occurs it was worth noting that the vegetation coverage in this region is sparse and has a strong response to precipitation spring as the recovery period of vegetation requires a large amount of water supply therefore spring drought has a great inhibitory effect on vegetation in the uwrb with insufficient water resources meanwhile in the mlwrb the probability of vegetation loss was 0 12 0 24 0 32 and 0 38 under the stress of summer autumn dtf events respectively which was the highest among the four sub regions of the wrb it seemed to illustrate that the vegetation in the mlwrb was the lowest resistant to summer autumn dtf events the mlwrb is mainly farmland with high vegetation coverage section 4 1 2 as described in fig s4 d the response time of this region to the summer autumn dfaa events was c 4 1 namely from august to november in the same period thus irrigation may have mitigated the effects of earlier droughts but high temperature stress in summer promoted surface water evaporation resulting in soil drying and ultimately affecting crop growth in the farmland moreover crops gradually mature after entering autumn and the excess precipitation affects their harvest therefore ecologists and stakeholders should pay more attention to vegetation changes affected by dfaa events 4 3 3 conditional probability of vegetation rising to the higher percentiles the emphasis is to systematically evaluate the antagonism effects of dfaa events on vegetation growth based on conditional probability distributions in this section that is the probabilities of the vegetation health status being higher than 90th 80th 70th and 60th quantiles under spring summer and summer autumn ftd ldfai 1 and dtf ldfai 1 conditions have been calculated using eqs 8 and 9 respectively figs 9 and 10 showed the conditional probability of vegetation growth under spring summer and summer autumn dfaa events respectively it can be seen from fig 9 that the probability of vegetation vitality higher than 90th 80th 70th and 60th quantiles under dfaa events is larger than zero and the probability under dtf events is significantly higher than under ftd events fig 10 showed a similar pattern indicating that dfaa events had a positive effect on vegetation growth and dtf events had a greater beneficial effect the possible reason is that the physiological changes of vegetation induced by previous drought stress were weakened the adverse effects of late flood stress for instance early stage drought stress of dfaa events may promote the accumulation of assimilates in crops by inhibiting cell growth and photosynthesis which may have an advantageous effect on the later stage flood stress response furthermore gao et al 2019 also confirmed this result using field experiments in 2016 and 2017 which found that the increase of seed setting rate and total grain number during drought stress may be the main reason that previous drought conditions of the dfaa events compensated the yield under flood period on a temporal scale the probability that ndvi exceeded a particular quantile under spring summer dfaa events was generally higher than that under summer autumn dfaa conditions i e 90th and 80th quantiles the antagonism induced by spring summer dfaa events was stronger than that induced by summer autumn dfaa events mitigating the adverse effects of drought and flood stress therefore exploring the response mechanism of vegetation to dfaa event compensation effects at different time scales based on conditional probability perspective may effectively improve the utilization rate of water resources on a spatial scale when the vegetation status was 90th 80th 70th and 60th quantiles the vegetation health probability of the uwrb increased from 0 12 0 19 0 22 to 0 27 under spring summer ftd condition respectively which was the largest among the four sub regions of the wrb indicating that spring summer ftd events had the greatest beneficial impact on the ecosystem in this region similarly the mlwrb had a greater positive response to summer autumn ftd scenarios and the probability of ndvi larger than 90th 80th 70th and 60th quantiles were 0 06 0 21 0 33 and 0 38 respectively overall the higher vegetation possibilities under dtf conditions are mainly concentrated in the jrb it also is observed in fig 10 d that the probability of ndvi values at 60th is as high as 0 71 under the dtf influence of the jrb as one of the regions with the most water shortage in china the wrb occupies a large proportion of cultivated land on the loess plateau to meet the demand of crop production the irrigation water in this region generally shows an increasing pattern and presents an obvious fluctuation influenced by soil fertility natural environment and meteorological factors however irrigation patterns such as alternate wet and dry irrigation and controlled irrigation can also cause water waste therefore decision makers should adopt appropriate drought flood control and irrigation indicators in four sub regions of the wrb to improve the utilization efficiency of precipitation and achieve the purpose of rational allocation of water resources 4 3 4 differences between synergism and antagonism of alternating stresses from a probabilistic perspective it is well known that both drought and flood can adversely affect ecosystems however there is still a lack of general knowledge as to whether the superimposed effect of alternating stress is attenuated or enhanced between drought and flood in addition the responses of vegetation to dfaa scenarios were inconsistent in different periods and different combinations of drought and flood such as the experiment in 2002 showed that severe drought stress seemed to cover up the effect of early flood on yield at maturity namely the antagonistic effect of drought and flood while the synergistic effect of drought and flood appeared in 2003 dickin and wright 2008 therefore the compensation or reduction effects of dtf and ftd in spring summer and summer autumn were investigated which is of great significance to reveal the disaster causing mechanism of dfaa events in ecosystems based on this the difference between the conditional probability of vegetation vigor above than specific high quantiles i e 90th 80th 70th and 60th and that of vegetation vigor below than designated low quantiles i e 10th 20th 30th and 40th was calculated under dfaa events in figs 11 and 12 probability differences expressed as p ndvi ndvihigh ldfai 1 p ndvi ndvilow ldfai 1 and p ndvi ndvihigh ldfai 1 p ndvi ndvilow ldfai 1 were summarized in spring summer and summer autumn where negative value signifies the synergistic effects of drought and flood stress whereas the positive value indicates the antagonistic effect it is interesting to notice that the wrb has negative and positive probability difference under spring summer ftd and dtf stress respectively fig 11 it seemed to suggest that previous flood can intensify the suppression and damage of late stage drought on crops namely aggravating the damage of single stress moreover excessive soil moisture was caused by early flood which caused the breathing difficulty of vegetation roots and induced physiological drought on the contrary early drought may enhance crop resistance to later flood thus weakening the negative effects of each other the dtf event is also beneficial to improve root activity showing the super compensation effect of improving crop yield a similar pattern was also described in fig 12 except for the mlwrb it is worth noting that the difference of positive and negative probability under the influence of summer autumn dfaa in the mlwrb is the smallest among the four sub regions indicating that the superposition effect summer autumn of dfaa events on this region is the weakest cropland is the main land use in the mlwrb and the response time of vegetation in this region to summer autumn dfaa is from august to november in the same period that is crops gradually mature and begin to harvest from the end of august to the autumn resulting in a significant decrease in ndvi this indicates that moisture and temperature may be not the main controlling factors affecting vegetation dynamics in this period which verifies the result that the probability difference is the lowest in addition the rapid development of urbanization in the mlwrb especially in the guanzhong plain is also the main cause of vegetation change in this region on the spatial scale the probability difference has various distribution patterns indicating that dfaa events have inconsistent effects on crops under different soil conditions and vegetation types such result coincided well with previous research conducted by cannell et al 1984 in general it was also observed that the jrb has a smaller negative probability difference under ftd scenarios therefore the ecosystem in this region has a higher vulnerability when suffering an ftd stress it was well known that dfaa events become more prevalent as a result of global warming however if ftd events become more frequent an enormous challenge is presented to the ecosystem adaptation to early flood stress may intensify sensitivity to late stage drought stress resulting in a significant diminution of vegetation vitality given summer autumn dtf conditions a large positive probability difference was captured in the uwrb fig 12 a indicating that dtf conditions play a more profound role in increasing vegetation vigor in this region meanwhile a previous study has indicated that the wrb will witness prevailing dtf events in the flood season june to september after 2000 shi et al 2021 therefore the vegetation vitality should be increased by fully improving the utilization efficiency of perception and exerting the compensation effect of dtf events in the future in general the ecological system may be comprehensive effects of various factors mainly precipitation air soil humidity vapor pressure solar radiation temperature in different periods however there are complex interactions between these factors namely the change of one factor may lead to significant changes of other factors which will have a more favorable adverse impact on vegetation 5 conclusions dfaa is a new and complex meteorological phenomenon normally caused by the rapid transition of drought and flood in a short time which can produce widespread impacts on terrestrial ecosystems however previous studies focused on the effects of dfaa events on crop yield and physiological characteristics but little on terrestrial ecosystems vegetation is an important factor reflecting ecological environment change and plays a key role in the carbon balance water cycle and exchange of land surface energy furthermore there is an ongoing debate about whether dfaa events induce vegetation increase or degradation based on this an evaluation framework was proposed for quantifying the impact of spring summer and summer autumn dfaa superposition effects mainly synergistic and antagonistic on vegetation by combining correlation analyses and binary copula based which compensates for the lack of uncertain methods the core of the evaluation framework is the pearson correlation coefficient copula theory and conditional probability first the pearson correlation coefficient with the largest absolute value of ndvi ldfai corresponded to the response time of vegetation to dfaa events then the copula function determined the dependent structure between ldfai and ndvi finally likelihoods of vegetation decline raise to lower higher percentiles were calculated perceptively this study led to three insights firstly the overall vegetation coverage in the wrb was improved the distribution of ndvi showed significant spatial heterogeneity namely it gradually increased from northwest to southeast secondly there was a positive correlation between ndvi and ldfai in wrb indicating that dtf events had a less inhibitory effect on vegetation compared with ftd events besides a lag response time of vegetation growth to dfaa events in four sub regions of the wrb differed significantly and was more than 4 months thirdly in terms of time the likelihood of vegetation below the designed quantiles i e 10th 20th 30th 40th and above the specified quantiles mainly 90th 80th 70th 60th under dfaa events in spring summer were generally higher than those in summer autumn indicating that vegetation vitality in the wrb was more sensitive to spring summer dfaa events spatially the jrb is an ftd sensitive area in the four sub regions of the wrb whereas the resistance of vegetation to the later flood was enhanced by the previous drought in dtf condition so that the vegetation in this area was subjected to the compensation effect under the stress of spring summer and summer autumn dtf ftd events the likelihood of vegetation decrease increase in the uwrb and mlwrb was higher the difference between the vegetation probability of high quantile and that of low quantile was negative under ftd conditions but it was positive under dtf conditions it can be manifested that ftd events had adverse effects on vegetation in the wrb namely the synergistic effect of drought and flood while dtf showed the antagonistic effect of drought and flood if ftd events become more widespread as a result of climate warming vegetation will face a serious challenge adaptation to antecedent flood stress may increase sensitivity to later drought the lag response of various regions can guide regional ecological environment protection and rational allocation of water resources real time dfaa events and their possible impact on vegetation can be predicted in the lag period so that an early warning about the potential impact of emerging dfaa conditions on terrestrial ecosystems can be released results also have theoretical and practical significance for ecological protection and human mitigation of dfaa events the assessment framework proposed in this study can also be applied to the analysis of the impact of concurrent or consecutive events such as wildfire drought heatwave and windstorm on vegetation for similar climate and topography in other regions of the globe in future studies the multivariable or vine copula method can be used instead of binary variables to accurately quantify the response mechanism of different vegetation types to dfaa events combining with soil moisture basin morphometric characteristics and human interventions moreover the effects of short term dfaa on vegetation dynamics were ignored in this study which may be analyzed in future studies declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

3192,understanding the response mechanism of vegetation growth to hydro meteorological events is essential at the global or regional scales especially in context of global warming and anthropogenic interventions previous studies have focused mainly on the responses of vegetation vulnerability to single drought or flood extremes but rarely on those of drought flood abrupt alternation i e coexistence and rapid transformation of drought and flood dfaa events on vegetation growth here this study proposed a binary copula evaluation model to quantitatively explore the internal mechanism of vegetation activity response to dfaa events flood to drought ftd and drought to flood dtf from probabilistic perspective the wei river basin wrb the largest tributary of the yellow river was selected as a case study normalized difference vegetation index ndvi was used as a proxy to reveal the spatial temporal dynamics of vegetation coverage then the response time of vegetation vitality to spring summer and summer autumn dfaa events was diagnosed finally the conditional possibility of different vegetation states under dfaa stress was examined results showed that 1 the lag time of optional vegetation response to dfaa events was more than 4 months 2 ftd and dtf showed drought flood synergism and antagonism by strengthening and weakening single stress respectively and 3 the jing river basin is an ftd sensitive area whereas as a summer autumn dtf compensatory area the decision makers should control the stress degree of the upper of the wrb to have a favorable impact on vegetation generally this study sheds new insights into vegetation response to dfaa events which provides effective theoretical support for decision makers to formulate effective strategies for dfaa mitigation

most serious costly and widespread meteorological disasters han et al 2021a drought flood is a complex natural phenomenon caused by insufficient excessive precipitation compared to the long term recorded averages which can lead to large threats to human society agricultural production ecosystems and water resources jiang et al 2019 drought flood abrupt alternation dfaa events within a certain region or basin is a new type of extreme hydrological event caused by coexistence and rapid alternation of drought and flood liu et al 2018a therefore it is a special performance of short term extreme precipitation anomaly which mainly includes drought to flood dtf and flood to drought ftd events dfaa events can cause more serious disasters than a single drought or flood event resulting in greater casualties and economic losses bi et al 2022 affected by abnormal atmospheric and oceanic circulation global climate change and human activities miao et al 2022 previous studies worldwide have shown that the spatial distribution of dfaa events is expanding and their frequency and intensity tend to increase cheng et al 2012 ma et al 2019 it was revealed that the rice yield ratio decreased by 30 3 under the stress of dfaa events xiong et al 2019 thus revealing the evolution of extreme dfaa events in changing environments understanding their potential driving mechanism and assessing the impact mechanism of dfaa events have been attracted increasing attention from academic communities various methods have been proposed to identify dfaa events including long cycle drought flood abrupt transition index ldfai yang et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 standardized precipitation index liu et al 2019 and standard weighted average precipitation index zhao et al 2020b among them ldfai considers the difference of precipitation and has a simple calculation process which lays a foundation for revealing the dynamics and physical causes of dfaa shan et al 2018 in addition it is appropriate to analyze dfaa events with ldfai which has been widely used at present bi et al 2021 liu et al 2019 to better understand how and why dfaa events change numerous studies nowadays have attempted to investigate their possible causes generally these studies focus on the relationship between dfaa events and hydroclimatic elements and atmospheric circulation such as vapor pressure precipitation temperature sunshine duration and el niño southern oscillation shan et al 2018 shi et al 2021 for example yang et al 2022 analyzed the characteristics of dfaa events in the yangtze river basin yrb based on ldfai and revealed the forces driving dfaa by combining relevant meteorological factors and teleconnection factors zhao et al 2020b found dfaa events of the hanjiang basin are likely to be more frequent and their intensity will increase significantly in the 21st century analyzing the dfaa events and intra seasonal oscillation in the mid high latitude meridional circulation of the upper troposphere over east asia yang et al 2013 found that significant differences in atmospheric circulation and water transport vapor flux were the main causes of dfaa events in the middle and lower reaches of the yrb in 2011 besides these aspects it is worth mentioning that the effects of dfaa events have been extensively revealed recently in different parts of the world for instance under the stress of the dfaa events the reactive oxygen species photosynthetic metabolism and energy metabolism pathway reaction of rice had strongly changed which led to the decrease of rice yield xiong et al 2019 bi et al 2019 investigated the dfaa events effects on leaf area index root system grain quality and yield in the field and the results showed that dfaa events had different effects on the growth of summer maize at the tasseling grain filling stage and seeding jointing stage however given that dfaa events are a more complex phenomenon the above studies on the influencing mechanism of dfaa events have focused on specific growth periods hence it is difficult to reveal the global rules of the effects of dfaa events on crop yield physiological characteristics and terrestrial ecosystem at different spatiotemporal scales the terrestrial ecosystem plays a key role in global ecological environment evolution climate change hydrological cycle and sustainable development of humans and nature ak et al 2020 piao et al 2014 vegetation coverage is an important component that reflects the ecological environmental change and the main vegetation pattern in an area is the result of the long term interaction between water landforms soil human activities and the atmosphere vegetation quantity quality and type are inevitably affected by solar radiation temperature precipitation and other factors and are extremely sensitive to climate change likewise as a vital indicator of ecosystem vulnerability vegetation can effectively feedback regional climate change dong et al 2021 currently the dynamic evolution of vegetation and its underlying response mechanisms to climate factors have gradually become the research focus the dfaa event is a new water stress phenomenon that makes vegetation change rapidly in two states of water deficit and surplus moreover there may be a superposition effect of dfaa events on a plant that is alternating stress could induce the physiological status of vegetation to appear synergistic or antagonistic characteristics which may weaken or strengthen the resistance of vegetation to dfaa events dong et al 2021 guo et al 2013 therefore a quantitative and visual assessment of the impact of dfaa events including synergistic and antagonistic effects on vegetation in climate change is a difficult task to maintain ecosystem stability and sustainable development of society and economy meanwhile as a prerequisite to clarify the climate ecosystem relationship quantifying the impact of extreme climate i e drought heatwave and compound dry hot on vegetation under global warming is critical recently numerous studies have been devoted to understanding how vegetation responds to extremes for instance with the development of statistical methods liu et al 2018b employed a first order autoregressive model and multiple linear regression model to confirm the length of the water memory effect and reveal the contribution of previous precipitation to current vegetation ceglar et al 2018 constructed a combined stress index based on summer drought stress and temperature stress to predict maize yields in europe however these studies are limited to using deterministic approaches to reveal the effects of extreme weather thus ignoring the complicated interaction of climate factors and vegetation responses in general uncertainty assessment based on the copula model is a promising way which has been widely applied for exploring the responses of vegetation to extreme climate conditions at regional and global scales due to its flexible analysis of multi variable joint probability period for example fang et al 2019b systematically assessed the likelihood of vegetation degradation to different drought levels moderate severe and extreme using copula conditional probability framework and identified the drought vulnerable areas in mainland china in addition this assessment model can also predict the probability distribution of vegetation degradation induced by specific disaster conditions fang et al 2019a fang et al 2019b which is of great significance for disaster mitigation however the probabilistic assessments of the compensation and reduction effects of dfaa events on vegetation are still lacking in addition besides dfaa events vegetation may be influenced by other cooccurring factors such as high temperatures and wind speeds making it challenging to isolate the role of dfaa in large regions therefore it is crucial to assess the impact of dfaa in a probabilistic manner it is well known that normalized difference vegetation index ndvi is currently considered to be the best indicator for monitoring vegetation growth and ecological environment as well as an effective indicator of inverting changes in surface vegetation coverage zhe and zhang 2021 zhu et al 2020 therefore ndvi is widely used to monitor vegetation dynamics and its response to ecological factors such as climate human activities and land use previous studies have found that obvious time lag effects may exist between extreme climate and vegetation growth that is vegetation growth is affected not only by simultaneous climatic factors but also by the cumulative effect of past climate conditions ding et al 2020 kong et al 2020 zhao et al 2020a this suggests that vegetation growth may respond to climate only when climate change exceeds the resistance of vegetation braswell et al 1997 kong et al 2018 tei et al 2017 therefore the main challenge of exploring the vulnerability of the terrestrial ecological environment is to calculate the lag effect of vegetation on global climate in this study a quantitative assessment framework was proposed to determine the superimposed effects of dfaa events on terrestrial ecosystems generally the main objectives are to 1 determine the response time of vegetation to spring summer and summer autumn dfaa events 2 identify dependence between vegetation vitality and dfaa events 3 evaluate synergistic and antagonistic effects of dtf and dft conditions on terrestrial ecosystems from a probability perspective results may improve our understanding of vegetation resistance to dfaa events will also provide a reference for researchers and decision makers to guide water resources management 2 study area and datasets 2 1 study area the wei river basin wrb is located in a semi arid and semi humid climate region which is one of the main sand transport sources of the yellow river basin it 103 5 110 5e 33 5 37 5 n flows through gansu ningxia and shaanxi provinces autonomous regions from west to east with a total length of 818 km and a watershed area of 13 48 104 km2 of which gansu ningxia and shaanxi account for 44 1 6 1 and 48 9 respectively the wrb has two tributaries namely the beiluo river basin blr and jing river basin jrb the area has a continental monsoon climate with annual potential evapotranspiration between 800 1000 mm and means annual precipitation in the range of 400 800 mm spatially precipitation has an increasing trend from north to south and precipitation in river valleys is lower than that in mountainous area the annual mean temperature of the wrb is between 7 8 and 13 5 with maximum and minimum temperatures of 42 8 and 28 1 respectively zhang et al 2021 according to the main reach and the tributaries this study selected upper reaches of the wrb uwrb middle lower reaches of the wrb mlwrb jrb and blr which divided the study area into four regions fig 1 a there are great spatial differences in geomorphic characteristics of the wrb with the loess plateau in the north plain in the middle and the qinling mountains in the south therefore there is severe soil erosion in this basin the terrain is high in the west and low in the east with an average elevation of 1300 m the primary land cover types in the wrb were cropland grassland and forest accounting for 41 3 38 0 and 16 5 in 2013 https www resdc cn data aspx dataid 263 respectively fig 1 b the main vegetation types in the northern part of the basin are grassland and shrub in the southern part under the global warming the wrb has become one of the most ecologically vulnerable areas in china due to the frequent climate disasters such as ecological environment degradation and river siltation 2 2 data sources normalized difference vegetation index ndvi also known as standardized vegetation index was first proposed by rouse schell 1973 ndvi can strongly reflect the physical mechanism of vegetation growth that is the difference between chlorophyll absorption in the red band and green scattering in the near infrared band gimms ndvi 3g spot ndvi and modis ndvi mod13 and myd13 are the most widely used vegetation index datasets among them the gimms ndvi 3g dataset presently is the global continuous ndvi dataset with the longest coverage time which is provided by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa https ecocast arc nasa gov data pub gimms 3g v1 in addition the ndvi 3g dataset can eliminate the errors caused by atmospheric conditions orbital drift and volcanic eruption through a series of pretreatments its quality is superior to other ndvi datasets so it is widely used to monitor long term trends in vegetation activity at regional and global scales in this study the gimms ndvi 3g dataset from 1982 to 2013 was selected with a spatial resolution of 1 12 and a 15 day interval firstly the 15 day ndvi 3g data was processed into monthly ndvi data using the maximum synthesis method secondly the monthly ndvi 3g dataset was converted into geotiff based on the vector boundary of the wrb monthly gimms ndvi raster dataset from 1982 to 2013 were extracted meteorological data are monthly precipitation data of 21 stations in the wrb from 1982 to 2013 which were obtained from china meteorological service center http data cma cn and have gone through the quality control fig 1 a 3 methodologies based on the historical data of the wrb a binary conditional probabilistic evaluation framework was established to quantify the impact of drought flood abrupt alternation dfaa on terrestrial ecosystems the probabilistic distribution characteristics of vegetation under the synergistic and antagonistic effects of drought flood were analyzed the evaluation process was shown in fig 2 3 1 long cycle drought flood abrupt transition index the time scale of spring summer march august and summer autumn june november dfaa defined in this study is 3 months seasonal scale namely spring summer is drought and summer autumn is flood known as spring summer summer autumn drought to flood dtf and vice versa the dfaa phenomenon of spring summer and summer autumn was described quantitatively in this study using a long cycle drought flood abrupt transition index ldfai which was defined according to the study by wu et al 2006 as follows 1 ldfai r j r i r i r j 1 8 r i r j where r i and r j are the standardized precipitation in spring summer and summer autumn respectively r j r i denotes the intensity of dfaa events r i r j represents drought and flood intensity term 1 8 r i r j is the weight coefficient which could reduce the weight of pure drought or flood events and increase the weight of dfaa events it should be noted that ldfai less than 1 represents the flood to drought ftd events while ldfai greater than 1 represents the dtf events shi et al 2021 the larger the absolute value of ldfai the severer the dfaa events are zhang et al 2019 2 r s p s p σ where ps s i j is the accumulated precipitation during the season p and σ are the long term mean and standard deviation of ps respectively 3 2 determination of vegetation response time to dfaa events this study measured the correlation between spring summer and summer autumn ldfai series spanning 1982 2013 and ndvi series with various lag periods to reveal response time of vegetation to spring summer and summer autumn dfaa events although some studies found that the lag time of vegetation growth to climate factors should be less than 4 months detsch et al 2016 wang et al 2021 studies on vegetation ecology also showed that the lag response time may be more than 4 months zhu 2019 therefore the longest lag scale of vegetation growth on spring summer and summer autumn dfaa events selected in this study was 16 and 13 months respectively moreover the mean of ndvi on a time scale of 1 to 6 months was also considered the pearson correlation method was used between spring summer and summer autumn ldfai and ndvi series at different lag periods t k i as follows 3 r t k i s c o r r l d f a i s n d v i t k i where r is correlation coefficient s spring summer or summer autumn t c or l indicating the corresponding period or lag k is 1 6 namely k 6 represents the mean value of ndvi at the 6 month scale i represents the number of simultaneous or lag months and is desirable 1 16 for instance r c 6 1 s p r i n g s u m m e r is the pearson correlation coefficient between spring summer ldfai series and average ndvi in the same period from march to august 6 month finally the lag period t k i corresponding to the maximum absolute value of the correlation coefficient between ndvi and spring summer summer autumn ldfai is the optimal response time ort of vegetation to dfaa events 4 or t s max corr l d f a i s n d v i t k i 3 3 copula conditional probability framework copula function can effectively describe the dependence of random variables including linear nonlinear symmetric and asymmetric relations and retain the correlation information of variables completely bhatti and hung quang 2019 at present this theory has become an effective tool to deal with hydrometeorological multi variable dependence relationship and flexibly construct its joint distribution function and has been widely used in the research of extreme events such as flood drought and rainstorms li et al 2020 mortuza et al 2019 tosunoglu et al 2020 xiao et al 2019 in this study the bivariate conditional probability framework of copula function was used to quantitatively reveal changes of vegetation activity under dfaa events stress and the specific steps are as follows 3 3 1 determination of marginal distribution the premise of constructing a copula function is to determine the marginal distribution function of random variables exponential distribution exp gamma distribution gamma normal distribution normal generalized pareto distribution gpd and generalized extreme value distribution gev are widely used marginal distribution functions at present khan et al 2021 tahroudi et al 2020 therefore the above five alternative distributions were selected in this study to fit the ndvi time series respectively considering the positive and negative nature of the ldfai time series only normal and gev meet the requirements moreover the non parametric kernel density estimation method can reproduce and retain the attributes and a series of features contained in the sample observation value lall 2012 sharma 2000 which was further applied to fit the ldfai series finally the optimal marginal distribution function of ndvi and ldfai sequences was evaluated based on the kolmogorov smirnov k s test and the minimum root means square error rmse criterion han et al 2021b 3 3 2 determination of joint distribution assuming that the marginal distribution functions of ndvi and ldfai series are u f ldfai l d f a i and v f ndvi n d v i respectively and their joint distribution function is f ldfai n d v i ldfai n d v i then according to sklar s theory there exists a unique copula function 5 f ldfai n d v i ldfai n d v i c f ldfai ldfai f ndvi ndvi c u v the cumulative probability distribution functions of ndvi and ldfai series were calculated based on the optimal marginal distribution and clayton copula frank copula gumbel copula gaussian copula and student s t copula were selected as alternative joint distribution functions to fit ndvi and ldfai variables the ordinary linear square ols criterion was used to optimize copula function shi et al 2020 3 3 3 describing vegetation response to dfaa events in this study the superposition effects of dfaa events on vegetation were considered including drought flood combination and drought flood antagonism firstly vegetation loss probabilities under dtf and ftd events stress were considered to reflect the synergistic effect of drought flood four vegetation loss scenarios were determined using the percentile method to reveal the probability of vegetation loss of different degrees induced by specific stress including ndvi at the 10th 20th 30th and 40th quantiles the specific formula is as follows under dtf events stress 6 p n d v i n d v i l d f a i 1 p l d f a i 1 n d v i n d v i p l d f a i 1 f ndvi n d v i c f ldfai 1 f ndvi n d v i 1 f ldfai 1 under ftd events stress 7 p n d v i n d v i l d f a i 1 p l d f a i 1 n

states i e 90th 80th 70th and 60th quantiles the conditional probability formula is as follows under dtf events stress 8 p n d v i n d v i l d f a i 1 p l d f a i 1 n d v i n d v i p l d f a i 1 1 f

and discussion 4 1 vegetation patterns and dynamics 4 1 1 temporal variation characteristics of ndvi there is a significant positive correlation between ecosystem parameters biomass and vegetation coverage and ndvi data namely the higher the ndvi value the higher the vegetation coverage based on this firstly the monthly gims ndvi data of each grid of the wrb spanning 1982 2013 were extracted using the maximum synthesis method secondly monthly ndvi values of four sub regions were calculated by the mean value method finally the interannual variation of the ndvi series was revealed to fully reflect the temporal pattern of vegetation coverage as can be seen from fig 3 the linear trend slopes of ndvi in the uwrb mlwrb jrb and blr were all greater than 0 indicating that vegetation vitality has been enhanced in this period except for the mlwrb the ndvi of other sub regions showed an obvious trend of increasing fluctuation after 2000 indicating that the vegetation coverage rate in these regions during 2000 2013 was significantly higher than that from 1982 to 1999 the implement of environmental management and ecological restoration projects since 1999 such as returning farmland to forest and grassland natural forest protection artificial afforestation and large areas of sea buckthorn were planted however this plant is prone to widespread death due to its strict requirement for precipitation since then more adaptable pinus tabuliformis and pinus sylvestris were planted to change the environmental conditions for vegetation growth and improve vegetation coverage and productivity therefore ndvi increased rapidly and showed a trend of fluctuation after 2000 indicating that the variation trend of ndvi in the wrb confirmed the actual situation of the region 4 1 2 spatial variation characteristics of ndvi taking the time series of ndvi as the mean of all pixels in the wrb can only reflect the overall pattern of vegetation change and cannot clearly describe the spatial difference of vegetation coverage change therefore this study used the monthly ndvi data of each pixel to calculate the multi year average ndvi dataset to explore the spatial pattern of vegetation coverage as can be seen from the legend color band the darker the color is the higher the ndvi value is indicating the higher vegetation coverage on the contrary the lighter the color is poor vegetation vitality which may be exposed land construction land and lake fig 4 showed that there were obvious spatial differences in ndvi of the wrb during 1982 2013 in general ndvi showed an increasing trend from northwest to southeast indicating that vegetation coverage in the southeast was better than that in the northwest a possible reason is that precipitation in the southeast of the wrb is more than that in the northwest and more precipitation is conducive to promoting vegetation growth resulting in higher vegetation vitality in the southeast the low value area of ndvi is mainly distributed in the uwrb and upper reaches of the jrb and blr the proportion of grassland and agricultural land in the uwrb is high which is heavily dependent on precipitation however this region belongs to a semi arid area so the lack of water resources leads to low vegetation coverage in the region the xifeng and zhengning located in the middle of jrb are subordinate to the qingyang their rich oil reserves and coal resources have rapidly promoted the development of urbanization and population growth which occupy vegetation areas and lead to vegetation degradation it is worth noting that the mlwrb has sporadic ndvi low value areas such as xi an baoji and xianyang as these regions are rich in natural resources their economy has rapidly developed and industry occupies a high proportion in economic structure in addition urban expansion constantly grabs farmland resulting in low vegetation coverage in the region 4 2 response time of ndvi to dfaa events the pearson correlation coefficient between spring summer summer autumn ldfai series and ndvi series with different lag periods was measured in four sub regions of the wrb fig 5 and figs s1 s3 showed the pearson correlation coefficients between spring summer ldfai and ndvi series with various lag time in the uwrb mlwrb jrb and blr respectively overall ldfai was positively correlated with ndvi indicating that vegetation coverage in the wrb magnified with the increase of spring summer ldfai namely compared with ftd events dtf events had a better consistency with vegetation growth in the uwrb the maximum correlation coefficient between ldfai and ndvi l 2 13 was 0 33 indicating that the response time of vegetation cover to dfaa events in the spring summer season was l 2 13 fig 5 similarly the correlation between ldfai and ndvi l 3 9 ndvi l 1 7 and ndvi l 1 7 in spring summer was the strongest in the mlwrb jrb and blr which were 0 35 p 0 05 0 48 p 0 01 and 0 42 p 0 05 thus the optimal response times of vegetation coverage to dfaa events in these sub regions were l 3 9 l 1 7 and l 1 7 respectively at the same time the effect of dfaa events on vegetation coverage was the greatest in the jrb followed by the blr and the least in the uwrb to similar the spring summer season ldfai and ndvi of study areas showed a positive correlation in the summer autumn fig 6 and figs s4 s6 in particular except for the mlwrb fig s4 and jrb fig s5 ldfai and ndvi are positively correlated with the increase of lag time to some extent response time can reflect the resistance of vegetation to dfaa events namely the longer lag response time the stronger the resistance of vegetation hence vegetation in the uwrb and blr could resist dtf events for a longer time moreover ndvi l 3 5 ndvi c 4 1 ndvi l 4 5 and ndvi l 2 7 had the strongest correlation with summer autumn ldfai series in the uwrb mlwrb jrb and blr and the correlation coefficient was 0 48 p 0 01 0 38 p 0 05 0 51 p 0 01 and 0 32 namely the optimal response times of vegetation coverage to dfaa events were l 3 5 c 4 1 l 4 5 and l 2 7 respectively meanwhile it also seemed to be seen that vegetation in the mlwrb can respond to dfaa events in a relatively short period fig s4 in brief the response of vegetation to dfaa events has a certain lag effect and the lag time was more than 4 months a series of studies have shown that vegetation in semi arid and sub humid regions has a longer response time to water than in arid and humid regions pasho et al 2011 vicente serrano et al 2013 the essential reason is that the ecosystem in this region is often stressed by the rapid transition between water deficit and redundancy and gradually evolved adaptive mechanisms to withstand the alternating stress in addition the response time of ndvi to dfaa events in the summer autumn season was significantly shorter than that in the spring summer season 4 3 responses of vegetation to dfaa stress 4 3 1 optimization of the marginal and joint distribution after determining the response time of ndvi in the wrb to dfaa events in spring summer and summer autumn the ndvi series corresponding to the response time and ldfai characteristic variables were fitted using the alternative marginal distribution proposed in section 3 3 1 respectively k s test and minimum rmse were used to determine the optimal marginal distribution function of each variable and the results were shown in table 1 based on the optimal marginal distribution of each series table 1 clayton copula frank copula gumbel copula gaussian copula and student s t copula were selected to construct joint distribution functions of ldfai and ndvi respectively the goodness of fitting test of each alternative distribution was calculated that is and the minimum ols were used as the criterion to select the optimal joint distribution table 2 as can be seen from table 2 ols of t copula and gumbel copula are the smallest among the five alternative distributions in the uwrb and jrb so they were selected as the joint distribution function of ndvi and ldfai of spring summer and summer autumn respectively frank copula and clayton copula have the best fitting degree in the mlwrb gumbel copula and t copula have the minimum ols in the fitting process of ndvi with spring summer and summer autumn ldfai in the blr and the fitting effect is the best 4 3 2 conditional probability of vegetation falling into the lower percentiles based on the four planting loss scenarios defined in section 3 3 3 10th 20th 30th and 40th percentiles the vegetation loss probability corresponding to the four scenarios under ftd and dtf stress was calculated to quantitatively reveal the combined impact of dfaa events on vegetation coverage according to eqs 6 7 respectively it can be seen from figs 7 and 8 that the probability of vegetation loss in the four sub regions of the wrb is higher under the stress of ftd events indicating that vegetation vitality in the study area is more sensitive to ftd events which is consistent with the conclusion in section 4 2 namely to ftd events since early flood events may inhibit vegetation photosynthesis by affecting the sunshine duration and solar radiation which could reduce vegetation coverage simultaneously vegetation may respond to prophase precipitation in a short time due to plant interception and slow soil infiltration during late drought however vegetation growth is closely related to soil water content continuous drought events may lead to insufficient soil water supply which further inhibits vegetation growth in addition when the flood stress is rapidly transformed into drought stress the later drought may enhance the adverse effects of the earlier flood conditions on vegetation by affecting photosynthesis and the accumulation distribution and transfer of dry matter in plants on the temporal scale under the stress of spring summer dfaa events the probability of loss at different vegetation statuses in the four sub regions of the wrb was generally higher than that in summer autumn indicating that vegetation growth in the study area was more sensitive to dfaa events in spring summer section 4 2 showed that ndvi has a longer response time to spring summer dfaa events compared with summer autumn so the resistance of vegetation to spring summer dfaa events has gradually decreased resulting in greater vegetation loss in addition as spring is the green season for crops and other plants drought or flood events in this season will seriously affect the photosynthesis of vegetation which could inhibit vegetation growth on the contrary when dfaa events occur in summer autumn vegetation has entered the mature stage and its growth is relatively stable so vegetation has a strong ability to resist dfaa events based on the analysis of the conditional probability of vegetation vigor below specific quantiles i e 10th 20th 30th and 40th in the uwrb mlwrb jrb and blr vulnerable areas of ecosystems under dfaa stress can be effectively identified from a spatial perspective as illustrated in figs 7 8 there was significant spatial heterogeneity in vegetation probability specifically a higher probability loss of ndvi at 10th 20th 30th and 40th percentiles was monitored in the jrb when suffering from ftd stress it seemed to be obvious that the vegetation in the jrb was highly sensitive to ftd events as a water limited area the jrb was dominated by grassland and lower root systems reduced the ability of vegetation to conserve water resulting in lower resistance to the late stage drought of ftd stress the previous study has also verified the reliability of this result that is frequent droughts have led to large scale degradation of temperate grasslands in northern china which has forced ecosystem functions to deteriorate luo et al 2021 it was also detected that a larger probability of vegetation vitality below 10th 20th 30th and 40th quantiles when the uwrb experienced spring summer dtf situation was 0 11 0 19 0 24 and 0 30 therefore it can be inferred that this region is prone to ecological degradation when spring summer dtf occurs it was worth noting that the vegetation coverage in this region is sparse and has a strong response to precipitation spring as the recovery period of vegetation requires a large amount of water supply therefore spring drought has a great inhibitory effect on vegetation in the uwrb with insufficient water resources meanwhile in the mlwrb the probability of vegetation loss was 0 12 0 24 0 32 and 0 38 under the stress of summer autumn dtf events respectively which was the highest among the four sub regions of the wrb it seemed to illustrate that the vegetation in the mlwrb was the lowest resistant to summer autumn dtf events the mlwrb is mainly farmland with high vegetation coverage section 4 1 2 as described in fig s4 d the response time of this region to the summer autumn dfaa events was c 4 1 namely from august to november in the same period thus irrigation may have mitigated the effects of earlier droughts but high temperature stress in summer promoted surface water evaporation resulting in soil drying and ultimately affecting crop growth in the farmland moreover crops gradually mature after entering autumn and the excess precipitation affects their harvest therefore ecologists and stakeholders should pay more attention to vegetation changes affected by dfaa events 4 3 3 conditional probability of vegetation rising to the higher percentiles the emphasis is to systematically evaluate the antagonism effects of dfaa events on vegetation growth based on conditional probability distributions in this section that is the probabilities of the vegetation health status being higher than 90th 80th 70th and 60th quantiles under spring summer and summer autumn ftd ldfai 1 and dtf ldfai 1 conditions have been calculated using eqs 8 and 9 respectively figs 9 and 10 showed the conditional probability of vegetation growth under spring summer and summer autumn dfaa events respectively it can be seen from fig 9 that the probability of vegetation vitality higher than 90th 80th 70th and 60th quantiles under dfaa events is larger than zero and the probability under dtf events is significantly higher than under ftd events fig 10 showed a similar pattern indicating that dfaa events had a positive effect on vegetation growth and dtf events had a greater beneficial effect the possible reason is that the physiological changes of vegetation induced by previous drought stress were weakened the adverse effects of late flood stress for instance early stage drought stress of dfaa events may promote the accumulation of assimilates in crops by inhibiting cell growth and photosynthesis which may have an advantageous effect on the later stage flood stress response furthermore gao et al 2019 also confirmed this result using field experiments in 2016 and 2017 which found that the increase of seed setting rate and total grain number during drought stress may be the main reason that previous drought conditions of the dfaa events compensated the yield under flood period on a temporal scale the probability that ndvi exceeded a particular quantile under spring summer dfaa events was generally higher than that under summer autumn dfaa conditions i e 90th and 80th quantiles the antagonism induced by spring summer dfaa events was stronger than that induced by summer autumn dfaa events mitigating the adverse effects of drought and flood stress therefore exploring the response mechanism of vegetation to dfaa event compensation effects at different time scales based on conditional probability perspective may effectively improve the utilization rate of water resources on a spatial scale when the vegetation status was 90th 80th 70th and 60th quantiles the vegetation health probability of the uwrb increased from 0 12 0 19 0 22 to 0 27 under spring summer ftd condition respectively which was the largest among the four sub regions of the wrb indicating that spring summer ftd events had the greatest beneficial impact on the ecosystem in this region similarly the mlwrb had a greater positive response to summer autumn ftd scenarios and the probability of ndvi larger than 90th 80th 70th and 60th quantiles were 0 06 0 21 0 33 and 0 38 respectively overall the higher vegetation possibilities under dtf conditions are mainly concentrated in the jrb it also is observed in fig 10 d that the probability of ndvi values at 60th is as high as 0 71 under the dtf influence of the jrb as one of the regions with the most water shortage in china the wrb occupies a large proportion of cultivated land on the loess plateau to meet the demand of crop production the irrigation water in this region generally shows an increasing pattern and presents an obvious fluctuation influenced by soil fertility natural environment and meteorological factors however irrigation patterns such as alternate wet and dry irrigation and controlled irrigation can also cause water waste therefore decision makers should adopt appropriate drought flood control and irrigation indicators in four sub regions of the wrb to improve the utilization efficiency of precipitation and achieve the purpose of rational allocation of water resources 4 3 4 differences between synergism and antagonism of alternating stresses from a probabilistic perspective it is well known that both drought and flood can adversely affect ecosystems however there is still a lack of general knowledge as to whether the superimposed effect of alternating stress is attenuated or enhanced between drought and flood in addition the responses of vegetation to dfaa scenarios were inconsistent in different periods and different combinations of drought and flood such as the experiment in 2002 showed that severe drought stress seemed to cover up the effect of early flood on yield at maturity namely the antagonistic effect of drought and flood while the synergistic effect of drought and flood appeared in 2003 dickin and wright 2008 therefore the compensation or reduction effects of dtf and ftd in spring summer and summer autumn were investigated which is of great significance to reveal the disaster causing mechanism of dfaa events in ecosystems based on this the difference between the conditional probability of vegetation vigor above than specific high quantiles i e 90th 80th 70th and 60th and that of vegetation vigor below than designated low quantiles i e 10th 20th 30th and 40th was calculated under dfaa events in figs 11 and 12 probability differences expressed as p ndvi ndvihigh ldfai 1 p ndvi ndvilow ldfai 1 and p ndvi ndvihigh ldfai 1 p ndvi ndvilow ldfai 1 were summarized in spring summer and summer autumn where negative value signifies the synergistic effects of drought and flood stress whereas the positive value indicates the antagonistic effect it is interesting to notice that the wrb has negative and positive probability difference under spring summer ftd and dtf stress respectively fig 11 it seemed to suggest that previous flood can intensify the suppression and damage of late stage drought on crops namely aggravating the damage of single stress moreover excessive soil moisture was caused by early flood which caused the breathing difficulty of vegetation roots and induced physiological drought on the contrary early drought may enhance crop resistance to later flood thus weakening the negative effects of each other the dtf event is also beneficial to improve root activity showing the super compensation effect of improving crop yield a similar pattern was also described in fig 12 except for the mlwrb it is worth noting that the difference of positive and negative probability under the influence of summer autumn dfaa in the mlwrb is the smallest among the four sub regions indicating that the superposition effect summer autumn of dfaa events on this region is the weakest cropland is the main land use in the mlwrb and the response time of vegetation in this region to summer autumn dfaa is from august to november in the same period that is crops gradually mature and begin to harvest from the end of august to the autumn resulting in a significant decrease in ndvi this indicates that moisture and temperature may be not the main controlling factors affecting vegetation dynamics in this period which verifies the result that the probability difference is the lowest in addition the rapid development of urbanization in the mlwrb especially in the guanzhong plain is also the main cause of vegetation change in this region on the spatial scale the probability difference has various distribution patterns indicating that dfaa events have inconsistent effects on crops under different soil conditions and vegetation types such result coincided well with previous research conducted by cannell et al 1984 in general it was also observed that the jrb has a smaller negative probability difference under ftd scenarios therefore the ecosystem in this region has a higher vulnerability when suffering an ftd stress it was well known that dfaa events become more prevalent as a result of global warming however if ftd events become more frequent an enormous challenge is presented to the ecosystem adaptation to early flood stress may intensify sensitivity to late stage drought stress resulting in a significant diminution of vegetation vitality given summer autumn dtf conditions a large positive probability difference was captured in the uwrb fig 12 a indicating that dtf conditions play a more profound role in increasing vegetation vigor in this region meanwhile a previous study has indicated that the wrb will witness prevailing dtf events in the flood season june to september after 2000 shi et al 2021 therefore the vegetation vitality should be increased by fully improving the utilization efficiency of perception and exerting the compensation effect of dtf events in the future in general the ecological system may be comprehensive effects of various factors mainly precipitation air soil humidity vapor pressure solar radiation temperature in different periods however there are complex interactions between these factors namely the change of one factor may lead to significant changes of other factors which will have a more favorable adverse impact on vegetation 5 conclusions dfaa is a new and complex meteorological phenomenon normally caused by the rapid transition of drought and flood in a short time which can produce widespread impacts on terrestrial ecosystems however previous studies focused on the effects of dfaa events on crop yield and physiological characteristics but little on terrestrial ecosystems vegetation is an important factor reflecting ecological environment change and plays a key role in the carbon balance water cycle and exchange of land surface energy furthermore there is an ongoing debate about whether dfaa events induce vegetation increase or degradation based on this an evaluation framework was proposed for quantifying the impact of spring summer and summer autumn dfaa superposition effects mainly synergistic and antagonistic on vegetation by combining correlation analyses and binary copula based which compensates for the lack of uncertain methods the core of the evaluation framework is the pearson correlation coefficient copula theory and conditional probability first the pearson correlation coefficient with the largest absolute value of ndvi ldfai corresponded to the response time of vegetation to dfaa events then the copula function determined the dependent structure between ldfai and ndvi finally likelihoods of vegetation decline raise to lower higher percentiles were calculated perceptively this study led to three insights firstly the overall vegetation coverage in the wrb was improved the distribution of ndvi showed significant spatial heterogeneity namely it gradually increased from northwest to southeast secondly there was a positive correlation between ndvi and ldfai in wrb indicating that dtf events had a less inhibitory effect on vegetation compared with ftd events besides a lag response time of vegetation growth to dfaa events in four sub regions of the wrb differed significantly and was more than 4 months thirdly in terms of time the likelihood of vegetation below the designed quantiles i e 10th 20th 30th 40th and above the specified quantiles mainly 90th 80th 70th 60th under dfaa events in spring summer were generally higher than those in summer autumn indicating that vegetation vitality in the wrb was more sensitive to spring summer dfaa events spatially the jrb is an ftd sensitive area in the four sub regions of the wrb whereas the resistance of vegetation to the later flood was enhanced by the previous drought in dtf condition so that the vegetation in this area was subjected to the compensation effect under the stress of spring summer and summer autumn dtf ftd events the likelihood of vegetation decrease increase in the uwrb and mlwrb was higher the difference between the vegetation probability of high quantile and that of low quantile was negative under ftd conditions but it was positive under dtf conditions it can be manifested that ftd events had adverse effects on vegetation in the wrb namely the synergistic effect of drought and flood while dtf showed the antagonistic effect of drought and flood if ftd events become more widespread as a result of climate warming vegetation will face a serious challenge adaptation to antecedent flood stress may increase sensitivity to later drought the lag response of various regions can guide regional ecological environment protection and rational allocation of water resources real time dfaa events and their possible impact on vegetation can be predicted in the lag period so that an early warning about the potential impact of emerging dfaa conditions on terrestrial ecosystems can be released results also have theoretical and practical significance for ecological protection and human mitigation of dfaa events the assessment framework proposed in this study can also be applied to the analysis of the impact of concurrent or consecutive events such as wildfire drought heatwave and windstorm on vegetation for similar climate and topography in other regions of the globe in future studies the multivariable or vine copula method can be used instead of binary variables to accurately quantify the response mechanism of different vegetation types to dfaa events combining with soil moisture basin morphometric characteristics and human interventions moreover the effects of short term dfaa on vegetation dynamics were ignored in this study which may be analyzed in future studies declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

3193,increasing human activities in cold regions have led to serious environmental problems due to non aqueous phase liquids napls contamination however the napls redistribution driven by freeze thaw ft cycles is not well understood in this study the redistribution of napls in porous media subjected to ft cycles in a temperature range from 20 c to 15 c was investigated using the low field nuclear magnetic resonance nmr technique the redistribution of napls in the prepared samples with napls saturation ranging from 13 56 to 72 05 was confirmed using the transverse spin spin relaxation time t 2 distribution and the magnetic resonance imaging mri experimental results revealed that substantial remobilization and distribution of napls occurred between the macropores t 2 greater than 300 ms and the mesopores 60 ms t 2 300 ms while the napls in the micropores t 2 60 ms remained almost unchanged during 30 ft cycles the main reason is attributed to the fact that the redistribution rate in micropores is much lower than in macropores and mesopores furthermore the napls content and the number of ft cycles were positively correlated for macropores while negatively correlated for mesopores for the samples with low napls saturation e g s n 13 56 and 13 56 the redistribution rate of napls versus ft cycles exhibited an overall linear relationship for macropores and mesopores while a non liner relationship for micropores for all pore categories the increment in s n can cause a remarkable deviation extent the balance between capillary pressure and freezing induced pressure was evaluated by the newly introduced dimensionless pressure ratio δp which could help determine the ultimate mobilization and redistribution of napls during ft cycles experimental tests suggested that the δp was much larger in macropores than in mesopores and micropores this can explain the dramatic difference in the redistribution rate among different pore categories this fundamental study is helpful in understanding the mobilization and redistribution mechanisms of napls in cold regions keywords freeze thaw cycles napls redistribution pore scale behavior freezing induced pressure nuclear magnetic resonance 1 introduction napls trapped in the subsurface are a primary source of groundwater and soil contamination in particular long term contamination occurs once napls penetrate the low permeability confining layers consisting of fine grained resulting in serious harm to public health and the environment cheng et al 2016 essaid et al 2015 therefore one of the major concerns in contaminant hydrology is the distribution and redistribution characteristics of napls before and after the implementation of a driving force han et al 2018 koch and nowak 2015 mercer and cohen 1990 vasudevan et al 2016 a non negligible physical circumstance in cold regions is the freeze thaw ft process of groundwater stored in soil the characteristics of redistribution of napls contamination driven by the ft cycle which is commonly diurnal or seasonal have to be unveiled singh and niven 2013 singh et al 2011 wang et al 2021 and the main concern is attributed to that the ft process can alter the physical and mechanical properties of porous media such as void ratio consolidation and permeability dashjamts and altantsetseg 2011 fan et al 2019 henry 2007 liu et al 2016 momeni et al 2016 conventionally frozen media was regarded as an impermeable barrier to contaminant propagation barnes and chuvilin 2009 solntseva 1998 however both laboratory and field investigations have shown that napls could have quite high mobility even in frozen media hence it is questionable to view the frozen media as an impermeable barrier for contaminant migration biggar et al 1998 chuvilin et al 1999 iwakun et al 2010 niven and singh 2008 in particular the ft cycles can cause significant remobilization and redistribution of napls trapped in frozen media barnes and filler 2003 chuvilin et al 2001b iwakun et al 2010 kiaalhosseini et al 2019 niven and singh 2008 singh et al 2011 laboratory studies found that the remobilization of napls occurred in the direction of freezing front for the top down freezing experiment using a two dimensional glass bead cell iwakun et al 2010 niven and singh 2008 wang et al 2021 in three dimensional visualization studies by x ray microcomputed tomography it was found that freeze thaw cycle could cause the spatial redistribution of napls in porous media haghighi 2006 singh et al 2011 previous studies have revealed the bulk effects of freezing and thawing processes on the napls remobilization and redistribution the driving mechanisms are however still unclear especially those at the pore scales biggar and neufeld 1996 iwakun et al 2010 niven and singh 2008 singh et al 2011 pore scale behaviors of fluids can be seen from x ray computed tomography x ray ct clausnitzer and hopmans 2000 fan et al 2020 goldstein et al 2007 singh et al 2011 nuclear magnetic resonance nmr govindarajan et al 2020 liu et al 2020 mao et al 2021a mao et al 2021b tian and wei 2020 wyrzykowski et al 2017 scanning electron microscopy sem ngien et al 2012 white and williams 1999 xu et al 2019 electrical impedance tomography eit chambers et al 2004 etc among the above techniques x ray ct and nmr are frequently preferred because they are non destructive and non invasive techniques that can help to quantitatively characterize the pore scale behavior of fluids however for the x ray ct technique the accurate identification of the spatial and temporal characteristics of a specific phase of a fluid requires sufficient x ray contrast between different phases which is commonly unavailable singh and niven 2013 alternatively nmr is a promising high accuracy testing technique for the investigations of pore scale behaviors of fluids chen et al 2021 mao et al 2020a mao et al 2020b rao et al 2019 wu et al 2019 two remarkable advantages of the nmr technique are the minimal sample preparation requirements and rapid testing the objective of this study is to investigate the redistribution characteristics of napls during ft cycles for this purpose six porous media samples saturated with napls and water were prepared with napls saturation ranging from 13 56 to 72 05 low field nmr technique was used to quantitatively monitor the spatial distribution of napls during the ft cycles in a temperature range from 20 to 15 c the t 2 distribution curves of water obtained from nmr were used to analyze the redistribution characteristics of napls and the freezing induced napls remobilization between different pore categories the freezing induced pressure and capillary pressure were determined and a dimensionless pressure ratio model was also proposed to interpret the dramatic changes of the redistribution rate of napls during freezing 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and apparatus glass silica beads with a diameter of 0 280 0 355 mm were chosen as porous media glass beads have been widely used to provide a simplified but realistic representation of the pore structure of natural porous media kennedy and lennox 1997 matmon and hayden 2003 niven 2006a and many studies have been conducted on the behavior of napl in porous media with glass beads as skeleton iwakun et al 2010 singh et al 2011 wang et al 2021 deionized and deaerated water was used as aqueous phase tetrachloroethylene pce 99 aladdin bio chem technology co ltd shanghai china was selected as the representative napls because on the one hand pce as a dense napls contaminant has caused a serious environmental problem in groundwater and soil system and on the other hand pce does not show any detectable low field 1h nmr response in the absence of hydrogen this ensures that the response of pce water glass beads system in low field 1h nmr measurement is from water only the container made of polytetrafluoroethylene namely teflon was used and filled with glass beads water and pce the volume of the cylindrical chamber in the teflon container was 29 45 ml with 25 mm inner diameter and 60 mm length see fig 1 a as can be seen in fig 1 b there are three variable knobs in the teflon container which provide space for ice expansion during freezing these knobs could effectively reduce the influence of ice expansion on the pore structure of the glass beads during freezing consequently the pore structure of the glass beads was almost unchanged during freezing see supporting information the displacement apparatus fig 1 a was used to establish the different pce saturations of the pce water glass beads system in the teflon container where the laboratory syringe pump tyd02 01 baoding leadfluid technology co ltd hebei china was used to inject the pce into the teflon container the low field 1h nmr analyzer macromr12 150h i manufactured by niumag electronic technology co ltd shanghai china was used for the measurement the analyzer mainly consists of a permanent magnet a data acquisition and analysis system a probe coil and a radio frequency system see fig 1c the main parameters of the nmr analyzer are magnetic field strength 0 3 0 05 t probe coil diameter 60 mm radio frequency 13 mhz magnet unit temperature 32 0 01 c effective sample detection range ø60 mm h200 mm in addition a high low temperature test chamber model bph 120a manufactured by shanghai yiheng scientific instrument co ltd with an effective range of 20 to 120 c was used to freeze the samples 2 2 methodology overview before performing the ft cycle experiments the water saturated glass beads were carefully prepared in the teflon container the glass bead was soaked and washed with deionized and deaerated water then the glass bead was placed in an oven dried at 110 c for 12 h and weighed after cooling the weighed glass bead was placed in a bottle filled with distilled water for 24 h to fully saturate the glass bead the saturated glass bead was compacted in deionized and deaerated water in the sample chamber of the teflon container to ensure that the glass bead was always in the saturated condition it should be mentioned that the glass beads were compacted in the teflon container to the target dry density 1 53 g cm3 in this study six samples with water saturated glass beads were prepared in the teflon containers with the same target dry density ensuring the consistency of pore size distribution among the prepared samples to avoid air bubbles boiled and cooled distilled water was used the prepared water saturated glass beads were subjected to nmr tests after 48 h of standing time to obtain a complete pore size distribution of the glass beads in the teflon container after the samples were prepared with water saturated glass beads in the teflon container and implemented by nmr tests the samples with the pce water glass beads system were established by drainage displacement at the different displacement rates to attain this the teflon container containing the water saturated glass beads was connected to the holder and the laboratory syringe pump via ptfe tubes see fig 1a then the pce was passed through the teflon container to displace the water in order to obtain the different water saturations and the residual water patterns six injection rates of pce from 0 05 ml min to 5 0 ml min were used resulting in a transition of immiscible displacement regimes with corresponding capillary numbers c a from 3 43 10 8 to 3 43 10 6 after more than 5 pore volumes of pce were injected into each sample the sample was placed on an experimental bench until the pce water glass beads system became stable the stability of the pce water glass beads system was monitored every 48 h by nmr tests thus the pce saturation in the six samples varied from s n 13 56 to 72 05 the details of the drainage displacement can be found in the supporting information the stable samples were placed in the high low temperature test chamber for freezing and thawing experiments the ft cycle testing was divided into the two phases of freezing and thawing at temperatures of 15 c and 20 c respectively the duration of each condition was set at 4 h with a total ft cycle of 8 h in this study a total of 30 ft cycles were performed with each sample after the target ft cycle e g 0 5 10 15 20 25 and 30 each sample was analyzed by nmr to monitor the pce redistribution driven by the ft cycles it should be noted that nmr monitor for the pce redistribution was indirectly realized by measuring water redistribution by nmr since the all samples were saturated with both water and pce and there was no drainage during the freezing and thawing experiments 2 3 nmr analysis theory low field 1h nmr as an efficient non destructive method has been widely used to determine pore size distribution and water content in porous media dou et al 2022 ma et al 2017 rao et al 2019 watanabe and wake 2009 yuan et al 2018 here the t 2 distribution curve was obtained by fourier transform of the original decay data of transverse relaxation time the pore size distribution and water content in the samples were characterized by the t 2 distribution curve in addition the relaxation decay data were obtained using carr purcell meiboom gill cpmg pulse sequence monitoring in this study all samples were measured with consistent parameters as shown in table 1 the t 2 value was the time required for the nucleus to transition from the excited state to the steady state i e the time required for the transverse magnetization vector to decay gradually from the maximum value to 37 t 2 is mainly influenced by the mobility of water molecules and closely related to the characteristics of the pore structure in porous media in the pores of saturated rock and soil t 2 is approximately equal to the surface relaxation time t 2surf bendel 1990 bird et al 2005 coates et al 1999 kenyon 1992 1 1 t 2 1 t 2 s u r f ρ 2 s v where ρ 2 is the surface relaxivity determined by the brunauer emmet teller method 10 μm s 1 in this study s v is the ratio of the surface area to volume of a pore calculated as 2 s v f s r where r is the pore radius f s is a geometrical shape factor that is assumed to be 1 2 or 3 for planar cylindrical or spherical pores respectively the pores were assumed to be cylindrical in this study suppose 1 f s ρ 2 c c is the conversion coefficient matching the following relationship 3 t 2 c r eq 3 shows that t 2 is proportional to the pore radius i e the t 2 value on the abscissa indicates the pore size that is the larger the t 2 value the larger the pore size the signal intensity on the ordinate represents the number of pores the larger the signal intensity the more pores with corresponding size liu et al rao et al 2019 sun et al 2020a wang et al 2018 therefore the pore size distribution could be determined in light of the t 2 distribution firstly the t 2 distribution curves of the water saturated samples can be determined furthermore the content and pore size of pore water can be calculated based on the peak area and t 2 value in the t 2 distribution curve of water and pce saturated samples then the change and distribution of water in water and pce saturated samples can be monitored and recorded by the nmr test under different ft cycles and by subtraction method the pce redistribution driven by ft cycles in water and pce saturated samples can be characterized 3 results and discussion 3 1 analysis of t2 distribution curves under different ft cycles fig 2 shows the t 2 distribution curves associated with pce distribution of samples with pce saturation s n 13 56 to 72 05 after different ft cycles based on the subtraction of the t2 distribution curve of samples saturated with water and pce and the same sample saturated with water as can be seen from fig 2 the t 2 distribution curve varies significantly with the ft cycles for all samples since on one hand the t 2 distribution curve reflects the distribution of water and the t 2 value is proportional to the pore size in which water is located the larger t2 value is the larger pore size is on the other hand the accumulated t 2 values of samples with pce saturation s n 13 56 to 72 05 are independence of the ft cycles see supporting information in fig s4 this variation of the t 2 distribution curve provides strong evidence for the inner redistribution of water and pce due to the ft cycles based on the t 2 value the pore size in porous media can be classified into three categories bayer et al 2010 bird et al 2005 todoruk et al 2003 water in micropores was assigned as t 2 distribution of 60 ms t 2 60 ms mesopore water was reported to be contained in peaks ranging between 60 and 300 ms 60 ms t 2 300 ms macropore water had peaks with a t 2 distribution of 300 ms t 2 greater than 300 ms it should be mentioned that the t 2 distribution curve with 0 ft cycle represents the initial distribution of water without the influence of freezing and thawing in the pce water glass beads system thus comparing the t 2 distribution curves of the water saturated sample to the t 2 distribution curves with 0 ft cycle see supporting information in fig s5 it can be found that on the one hand most of the t 2 values of the water saturated samples are above 60 ms indicating that the number of macropores and mesopores in the samples is much larger than the number of micropores on the other hand the peak area of the t 2 distribution curve of more than 60 ms was significantly reduced after the injection of pce indicating that the injected pce was mainly in macropores and mesopores in all samples observation of the variation of the t 2 distribution curves with ft cycles in fig 2 suggested that the pce redistribution is not only related to the pore size of the samples but also to the s n as can be seen from fig 2 the variation of the t 2 distribution curve with ft cycles was clearly observed in both mesopores and macropores while a slight variation was captured in micropores this indicates that the pce redistribution was caused by transport between mesopores and macropores since all samples were prepared as a closed system where no drainage of water and pce occurs during ft cycles it can be seen from fig 2 that the amplitude of the variation of the t 2 distribution curves increased with decreasing s n the observed changes in the amplitude of the t 2 distribution curves were significant at the smaller s n and became trivial when s n was larger another finding in fig 2 is that with successive ft cycles the changing trend of t 2 distribution curves is basically the same for all samples i e the pce increases in the macropores while decreases in the mesopores with increasing ft cycles a slight change of pce was observed in the micropores this is evident that the number of ft cycles has a significant influence on the redistribution of pce in the porous media 3 2 analysis of pce redistribution based on magnetic resonance imaging mri in terms of the process of magnetic resonance imaging mri the gradient pulse sequence of the emitted electromagnetic wave excited by an external gradient magnetic field is used to spatially position the object after selecting the layer gradient phase encoding and frequency encoding a data matrix is formed and finally a pixel matrix is formed by image reconstruction which represents the cross sectional view of the sample in a particular layer sun et al 2020b the darker the pixel color the more fluid is contained in the pores and the more pronounced the pores are the larger the corresponding pixel value which directly reflects the distribution of pores in the porous media in this study the 1h mri images of samples were also acquired on macromr12 150h i low field 1h nmr analyzer spin echo se imaging sequence was used to obtain weighted images of samples for all images the slice width and slice gap were 3 0 mm and 2 0 mm respectively with offset slice of 0 0 mm echo time te and repetition time tr of weighted image were 20 ms and 500 ms the images obtained from mri were processed with two software unified mapping and pseudocolor processing after unified mapping and pseudocolor processing the gray level images were changed to color images fig 3 shows the proton density weighted images of the longitudinal section in the middle layer of the samples under different ft cycles and the color shows the relative strength range of 1h in the pores the blue color in the images represents pce and a solid skeleton and shows no imaging signal while the yellow color indicates the high proton density which shows a relatively strong 1h signal in fig 3 it is clear that the proton density in the middle layer of the samples treated with different capillary numbers shows significant changes after ft cycles moreover the blue area representing the pce and the solid skeleton also shows some differences with different ft cycles in terms of location and area it can be concluded that the ft cycles could cause the redistribution of pce in the middle layer of the samples to show more clearly that ft cycles cause a redistribution of pce in the middle layer of the samples the subtraction images were determined between different ft cycles fig 4 shows the proton density weighted images of the samples after image subtraction between different ft cycles as can be seen from the fig 4 all subtraction images have different degrees of proton density distribution from this we can infer that the pce in the middle layer have been redistributed after the ft cycles in the samples 3 3 dependence of pore scale pce redistribution on ft cycles the redistribution of water and pce due to the ft cycles was confirmed by the t2 distribution curves and the proton density weighted images as shown in sec 3 1 and sec 3 2 this redistribution shows a strong dependence on both the initial distribution of pce and the number of ft cycles here we further investigated the dependence of the pce redistribution on ft cycles with respect to the previous pore size categories in order to determine the contribution of pore size to the redistribution of water and pce the pore size dependent pce fractions and the pore size dependent pce saturation were introduced the pore size dependent pce fractions in the different pores e g micropores mesopores and macropores were determined for all samples by the ratio of the area under the curve of the corresponding pore size to the total area of the t 2 distribution curve it should be noted that the sum of the pore size dependent pce fractions in the three different pore categories was constant and equal to 1 during the ft cycles because no drainage of water and pce occurred during the ft cycles the pore size dependent pce saturation in the corresponding pore size s n i was calculated by 4 s n i v n i v v i i m i c m e s a n d m a c where v v i and v n i represent the pore volume and the pce volume in the micropores mesopores or macropores respectively the s n i can be determined by the ratio of the area under the curve of the corresponding pore size to the total area of the t 2 distribution curve of the water saturated samples when the s n i was equal to 1 the pce saturated the corresponding pore category fig 5 shows the pore size dependent pce saturations and fractions in the micropores mesopores and macropores during ft cycles for pce saturations s n 13 56 to 72 05 it is clear from fig 5 that the pore size dependent pce saturations and fractions change to different extent with increasing ft cycles for all samples for all samples the s n mac in the macropores exhibited a positive correlation with increasing ft cycles while the s n mes in the mesopores showed a negative correlation with increasing ft cycles however the s n mic in the micropores was almost unchanged with increasing ft cycles this suggests that the contribution of the micropores of samples to pce redistribution driven by ft cycles is much smaller than that of the mesopores and macropores all pore size dependent pce saturations were 1 after 30 ft cycles indicating that the water occurred in different pore categories the detailed data of s n i for all samples can be found in supporting information in table s4 it was also found that the variation of sn in macropores and mesopores with ft cycles increased as the sn decreased this indicates that the relatively high water saturation of the samples enhances the redistribution of pce driven by ft cycles the fraction of pores occupied by pce of all samples after different ft cycles in fig 5 was also analyzed it was found that with increasing ft cycles the pore size dependent pce fractions in the macropores first increased and then gradually tended to be stable also the fluctuations of the pore size dependent pce fractions in the micropores and mesopores was small therefore it can be concluded that the influence of ft cycles on the redistribution of pce was not constant but history dependent and related to the distribution and saturation of pce in porous media in other words the redistribution of pce driven by ft cycles could be insignificant if the redistribution of pce was driven by multiple ft cycles this is important and constructive for predicting the fate and transport of napls contamination in seasonally freezing and frozen soils because the redistribution of pce driven by ft cycles could be insignificant after enough ft cycles comparing fig 5 a b with fig 5 e f it is clear that the pore size dependent pce fractions changed significantly when the pce saturation of the samples was relatively low while the pore size dependent pce fractions changed slightly with increasing ft cycles when the pce saturation of the samples was relatively high this indicates that the pce saturation of the samples has a significant influence on the redistribution of pce during the ft cycles this will be discussed further in sec 3 4 3 4 correlation analysis of redistribution rates and freezing behavior to quantitatively investigate the influence of ft cycles on the redistribution of pce the redistribution rate r t was introduced based on amplitude change of the t 2 distribution curves the r t was determined as follows 5 r t s ftx s f t 0 s s s f t 0 100 where sft0 is the peak area in the t 2 distribution curves of the samples at 0 ft cycles sftx is the peak area in the t 2 distribution curves of the samples at the ft cycles ss is the total peak areas of the t 2 distribution curves of the water saturated sample figs 6 and 7 show the relationship between r t and n in micropores mesopores and macropores for different pce saturations of the samples from figs 6 and 7 it can be seen that for all samples the r t is much smaller in the micropores than in the macropores and mesopores indicating that the freezing induced transport behavior of pce occurred mainly in the macropores and mesopores a simple linear relationship was proposed to fit the data in fig 6 as follows 6 r t α n β n 0 where n is the number of freeze thaw cycles α and β are the slope and intercept of the curve the parameter α reflects the rate of change of the redistribution rate with the ft cycles although a simple linear relationship between r t and n may not be sufficient to characterize and predict the freezing induced transport behavior of pce this simple linear relationship could be considered as a metric for characterizing the magnitude of nonlinearity of the freezing induced transport behavior of pce as can be seen from figs 6 and 7 for the samples with low pce saturation e g s n 13 56 and 13 56 the r t in the macropores and mesopores generally showed a linear relationship whereas the r t in the micropores generally showed a non linear relationship as s n increases r t and n deviate from the linear relationship in all pore categories this non linear relationship between r t and n could be resulted from the soil and pce properties initial napl water saturation and freezing speed barnes and filler 2003 chuvilin et al 2001a singh and niven 2013 there are three mechanisms e g freezing induced expulsion freezing indued cutoff and ganglion contraction that cause mobilization and redistribution of pce during ft cycles among these mechanisms both the capillary pressure and the freezing induced pressure due to water expansion play important roles in the mobilization and redistribution of pce during ft cycles the freezing induced pressure δ p n is related to water saturation and is given by niven and singh 2008 7 δ p n 1 κ t ln s n 1 s n s n 1 s n ρ w ρ ice 1 where κt is the isothermal compressibility and ρw and ρice are the densities of water and ice respectively the densities of water and ice are 999 8 and 916 7 kg m 3 at 0 c respectively niven and singh 2008 for pce the isothermal compressibility is 1061 6 tpa 1 nath and anita 2000 it should be noted that although the freezing induced pressure can be determined using eq 7 the determined freezing induced pressure by eq 7 is based on the saturation of the entire samples and thus represents the freezing induced pressure in the bulk and not on pore scale since the mobilization and redistribution of pce between different pore categories have been observed the current interest is to investigate the mechanism of mobilization and redistribution of pce between different pore categories therefore eq 7 was modified to characterize the freezing induced pressure in the different pore categories 8 δ p n i 1 κ t ln s n i 1 s n i s n i 1 s n i ρ w ρ ice 1 i m i c m e s a n d m a c eq 7 provides the freezing induced pressure in the different pore categories the capillary pressure which is the pressure difference across the interface of two different fluids can be described by the young laplace equation niven 2006b pickell et al 1966 9 δ p c σ 1 r 1 1 r 2 2 h σ where σ is the surface or interfacial tension between the two fluids and σ 45 dynes cm demond and lindner 1993 imhoff et al 1995 the r 1 and r 2 are the orthogonal principal radii of curvature of the interface at any point h is the mean interfacial curvature considering the capillary pressure associated with entrapment of pce in porous media niven and singh 2008 the eq 9 can be rewritten as follow 10 δ p c 2 h σ 2 σ r where the r is the pore size of the samples since the capillary pressure provides a resisting force for the entrapment of pce in the pores and the freezing induced pressure is a driving force for the mobilization and redistribution of pce during the ft cycles the balance between the capillary pressure and the freezing induced pressure could ultimately determine the mobilization and redistribution of pce during the ft cycles here a dimensionless pressure ratio δp was introduced to evaluate the influence of the balance between the capillary pressure and the freezing induced pressure on the redistribution of pce during the ft cycles the dimensionless pressure ratio δp was given by 11 δ p δ p n i δ p c r 2 σ κ t ln s n i 1 s n i s n i 1 s n i ρ w ρ ice 1 table 2 shows the determined δp of the samples in micropores mesopores and macropores during the ft cycles overall the determined δp for all pore categories are much larger than 1 0 indicating that the freezing induced pressure is much higher than the pressure associated the entrapment of pce in porous media during the ft cycles especially the δp in all samples is much larger in macropores than in mesopores and micropores the δp also explains the dramatic changes in the redistribution rate r t in in the different pore categories in figs 6 and 7 the magnitude of δp shows a positive correlation with the redistribution rate r t for all pore categories in table 2 it was found that the δp decreased with increasing number of ft cycles for the macropores this indicates that the remobilization and redistribution of pce in the macropores gradually tends to be a steady state although the pce water system in the micropores and mesopores is still unstable this finding extends the previous study that showed that the spatial distribution of napls ganglia was in an unsteady state after 10 ft cycles singh et al 2011 the observed occurrence of steady state distribution of napls driven by ft cycles is important for predicting the behavior of napls spills and risk assessment of napls contaminated sites in cold regions 4 conclusions in this study pce redistribution driven by ft cycles in porous media was experimentally confirmed and investigated the t 2 distribution of low field 1h nmr was proposed as a promising technique to quantitatively determine the pce redistribution driven by the ft cycles in porous media the proton density weighted images based on nmr also provided visual evidence of the pce redistribution driven by the ft cycles especially the freezing induced pce interactions between the different pore categories of the samples were identified the main findings of this study can be summarized as follows 1 pce redistribution driven by the ft cycles is related not only to the pore size but also to the pce saturation of the samples and is significantly influenced by the number of ft cycles however pce redistribution driven by the ft cycles is history dependent and is related to the initial pce distribution and saturation in porous media 2 the contribution of micropores to pce redistribution driven by ft cycles is much less remarkable than that of mesopores and macropores at low pce saturation e g s n 13 56 and 13 56 the redistribution rate in the macropores and mesopores overall exhibits a linear relationship while a non linear relationship in micropores as s n increased the non linear pattern tends to be prominent for all pore categories 3 both capillary pressure and freezing induced pressure due to water expansion play important roles in the mobilization and redistribution of pce during ft cycles the introduced dimensionless pressure ratio δp can explain the dramatic changes in the redistribution rate r t in the different pore categories the δp decreased with the number of ft cycles for the macropores suggesting that the remobilization and redistribution of pce in the macropores gradually weakens although the pce water system in the micropores and mesopores is still

3193,increasing human activities in cold regions have led to serious environmental problems due to non aqueous phase liquids napls contamination however the napls redistribution driven by freeze thaw ft cycles is not well understood in this study the redistribution of napls in porous media subjected to ft cycles in a temperature range from 20 c to 15 c was investigated using the low field nuclear magnetic resonance nmr technique the redistribution of napls in the prepared samples with napls saturation ranging from 13 56 to 72 05 was confirmed using the transverse spin spin relaxation time t 2 distribution and the magnetic resonance imaging mri experimental results revealed that substantial remobilization and distribution of napls occurred between the macropores t 2 greater than 300 ms and the mesopores 60 ms t 2 300 ms while the napls in the micropores t 2 60 ms remained almost unchanged during 30 ft cycles the main reason is attributed to the fact that the redistribution rate in micropores is much lower than in macropores and mesopores furthermore the napls content and the number of ft cycles were positively correlated for macropores while negatively correlated for mesopores for the samples with low napls saturation e g s n 13 56 and 13 56 the redistribution rate of napls versus ft cycles exhibited an overall linear relationship for macropores and mesopores while a non liner relationship for micropores for all pore categories the increment in s n can cause a remarkable deviation extent the balance between capillary pressure and freezing induced pressure was evaluated by the newly introduced dimensionless pressure ratio δp which could help determine the ultimate mobilization and redistribution of napls during ft cycles experimental tests suggested that the δp was much larger in macropores than in mesopores and micropores this can explain the dramatic difference in the redistribution rate among different pore categories this fundamental study is helpful in understanding the mobilization and redistribution mechanisms of napls in cold regions keywords freeze thaw cycles napls redistribution pore scale behavior freezing induced pressure nuclear magnetic resonance 1 introduction napls trapped in the subsurface are a primary source of groundwater and soil contamination in particular long term contamination occurs once napls penetrate the low permeability confining layers consisting of fine grained resulting in serious harm to public health and the environment cheng et al 2016 essaid et al 2015 therefore one of the major concerns in contaminant hydrology is the distribution and redistribution characteristics of napls before and after the implementation of a driving force han et al 2018 koch and nowak 2015 mercer and cohen 1990 vasudevan et al 2016 a non negligible physical circumstance in cold regions is the freeze thaw ft process of groundwater stored in soil the characteristics of redistribution of napls contamination driven by the ft cycle which is commonly diurnal or seasonal have to be unveiled singh and niven 2013 singh et al 2011 wang et al 2021 and the main concern is attributed to that the ft process can alter the physical and mechanical properties of porous media such as void ratio consolidation and permeability dashjamts and altantsetseg 2011 fan et al 2019 henry 2007 liu et al 2016 momeni et al 2016 conventionally frozen media was regarded as an impermeable barrier to contaminant propagation barnes and chuvilin 2009 solntseva 1998 however both laboratory and field investigations have shown that napls could have quite high mobility even in frozen media hence it is questionable to view the frozen media as an impermeable barrier for contaminant migration biggar et al 1998 chuvilin et al 1999 iwakun et al 2010 niven and singh 2008 in particular the ft cycles can cause significant remobilization and redistribution of napls trapped in frozen media barnes and filler 2003 chuvilin et al 2001b iwakun et al 2010 kiaalhosseini et al 2019 niven and singh 2008 singh et al 2011 laboratory studies found that the remobilization of napls occurred in the direction of freezing front for the top down freezing experiment using a two dimensional glass bead cell iwakun et al 2010 niven and singh 2008 wang et al 2021 in three dimensional visualization studies by x ray microcomputed tomography it was found that freeze thaw cycle could cause the spatial redistribution of napls in porous media haghighi 2006 singh et al 2011 previous studies have revealed the bulk effects of freezing and thawing processes on the napls remobilization and redistribution the driving mechanisms are however still unclear especially those at the pore scales biggar and neufeld 1996 iwakun et al 2010 niven and singh 2008 singh et al 2011 pore scale behaviors of fluids can be seen from x ray computed tomography x ray ct clausnitzer and hopmans 2000 fan et al 2020 goldstein et al 2007 singh et al 2011 nuclear magnetic resonance nmr govindarajan et al 2020 liu et al 2020 mao et al 2021a mao et al 2021b tian and wei 2020 wyrzykowski et al 2017 scanning electron microscopy sem ngien et al 2012 white and williams 1999 xu et al 2019 electrical impedance tomography eit chambers et al 2004 etc among the above techniques x ray ct and nmr are frequently preferred because they are non destructive and non invasive techniques that can help to quantitatively characterize the pore scale behavior of fluids however for the x ray ct technique the accurate identification of the spatial and temporal characteristics of a specific phase of a fluid requires sufficient x ray contrast between different phases which is commonly unavailable singh and niven 2013 alternatively nmr is a promising high accuracy testing technique for the investigations of pore scale behaviors of fluids chen et al 2021 mao et al 2020a mao et al 2020b rao et al 2019 wu et al 2019 two remarkable advantages of the nmr technique are the minimal sample preparation requirements and rapid testing the objective of this study is to investigate the redistribution characteristics of napls during ft cycles for this purpose six porous media samples saturated with napls and water were prepared with napls saturation ranging from 13 56 to 72 05 low field nmr technique was used to quantitatively monitor the spatial distribution of napls during the ft cycles in a temperature range from 20 to 15 c the t 2 distribution curves of water obtained from nmr were used to analyze the redistribution characteristics of napls and the freezing induced napls remobilization between different pore categories the freezing induced pressure and capillary pressure were determined and a dimensionless pressure ratio model was also proposed to interpret the dramatic changes of the redistribution rate of napls during freezing 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and apparatus glass silica beads with a diameter of 0 280 0 355 mm were chosen as porous media glass beads have been widely used to provide a simplified but realistic representation of the pore structure of natural porous media kennedy and lennox 1997 matmon and hayden 2003 niven 2006a and many studies have been conducted on the behavior of napl in porous media with glass beads as skeleton iwakun et al 2010 singh et al 2011 wang et al 2021 deionized and deaerated water was used as aqueous phase tetrachloroethylene pce 99 aladdin bio chem technology co ltd shanghai china was selected as the representative napls because on the one hand pce as a dense napls contaminant has caused a serious environmental problem in groundwater and soil system and on the other hand pce does not show any detectable low field 1h nmr response in the absence of hydrogen this ensures that the response of pce water glass beads system in low field 1h nmr measurement is from water only the container made of polytetrafluoroethylene namely teflon was used and filled with glass beads water and pce the volume of the cylindrical chamber in the teflon container was 29 45 ml with 25 mm inner diameter and 60 mm length see fig 1 a as can be seen in fig 1 b there are three variable knobs in the teflon container which provide space for ice expansion during freezing these knobs could effectively reduce the influence of ice expansion on the pore structure of the glass beads during freezing consequently the pore structure of the glass beads was almost unchanged during freezing see supporting information the displacement apparatus fig 1 a was used to establish the different pce saturations of the pce water glass beads system in the teflon container where the laboratory syringe pump tyd02 01 baoding leadfluid technology co ltd hebei china was used to inject the pce into the teflon container the low field 1h nmr analyzer macromr12 150h i manufactured by niumag electronic technology co ltd shanghai china was used for the measurement the analyzer mainly consists of a permanent magnet a data acquisition and analysis system a probe coil and a radio frequency system see fig 1c the main parameters of the nmr analyzer are magnetic field strength 0 3 0 05 t probe coil diameter 60 mm radio frequency 13 mhz magnet unit temperature 32 0 01 c effective sample detection range ø60 mm h200 mm in addition a high low temperature test chamber model bph 120a manufactured by shanghai yiheng scientific instrument co ltd with an effective range of 20 to 120 c was used to freeze the samples 2 2 methodology overview before performing the ft cycle experiments the water saturated glass beads were carefully prepared in the teflon container the glass bead was soaked and washed with deionized and deaerated water then the glass bead was placed in an oven dried at 110 c for 12 h and weighed after cooling the weighed glass bead was placed in a bottle filled with distilled water for 24 h to fully saturate the glass bead the saturated glass bead was compacted in deionized and deaerated water in the sample chamber of the teflon container to ensure that the glass bead was always in the saturated condition it should be mentioned that the glass beads were compacted in the teflon container to the target dry density 1 53 g cm3 in this study six samples with water saturated glass beads were prepared in the teflon containers with the same target dry density ensuring the consistency of pore size distribution among the prepared samples to avoid air bubbles boiled and cooled distilled water was used the prepared water saturated glass beads were subjected to nmr tests after 48 h of standing time to obtain a complete pore size distribution of the glass beads in the teflon container after the samples were prepared with water saturated glass beads in the teflon container and implemented by nmr tests the samples with the pce water glass beads system were established by drainage displacement at the different displacement rates to attain this the teflon container containing the water saturated glass beads was connected to the holder and the laboratory syringe pump via ptfe tubes see fig 1a then the pce was passed through the teflon container to displace the water in order to obtain the different water saturations and the residual water patterns six injection rates of pce from 0 05 ml min to 5 0 ml min were used resulting in a transition of immiscible displacement regimes with corresponding capillary numbers c a from 3 43 10 8 to 3 43 10 6 after more than 5 pore volumes of pce were injected into each sample the sample was placed on an experimental bench until the pce water glass beads system became stable the stability of the pce water glass beads system was monitored every 48 h by nmr tests thus the pce saturation in the six samples varied from s n 13 56 to 72 05 the details of the drainage displacement can be found in the supporting information the stable samples were placed in the high low temperature test chamber for freezing and thawing experiments the ft cycle testing was divided into the two phases of freezing and thawing at temperatures of 15 c and 20 c respectively the duration of each condition was set at 4 h with a total ft cycle of 8 h in this study a total of 30 ft cycles were performed with each sample after the target ft cycle e g 0 5 10 15 20 25 and 30 each sample was analyzed by nmr to monitor the pce redistribution driven by the ft cycles it should be noted that nmr monitor for the pce redistribution was indirectly realized by measuring water redistribution by nmr since the all samples were saturated with both water and pce and there was no drainage during the freezing and thawing experiments 2 3 nmr analysis theory low field 1h nmr as an efficient non destructive method has been widely used to determine pore size distribution and water content in porous media dou et al 2022 ma et al 2017 rao et al 2019 watanabe and wake 2009 yuan et al 2018 here the t 2 distribution curve was obtained by fourier transform of the original decay data of transverse relaxation time the pore size distribution and water content in the samples were characterized by the t 2 distribution curve in addition the relaxation decay data were obtained using carr purcell meiboom gill cpmg pulse sequence monitoring in this study all samples were measured with consistent parameters as shown in table 1 the t 2 value was the time required for the nucleus to transition from the excited state to the steady state i e the time required for the transverse magnetization vector to decay gradually from the maximum value to 37 t 2 is mainly influenced by the mobility of water molecules and closely related to the characteristics of the pore structure in porous media in the pores of saturated rock and soil t 2 is approximately equal to the surface relaxation time t 2surf bendel 1990 bird et al 2005 coates et al 1999 kenyon 1992 1 1 t 2 1 t 2 s u r f ρ 2 s v where ρ 2 is the surface relaxivity determined by the brunauer emmet teller method 10 μm s 1 in this study s v is the ratio of the surface area to volume of a pore calculated as 2 s v f s r where r is the pore radius f s is a geometrical shape factor that is assumed to be 1 2 or 3 for planar cylindrical or spherical pores respectively the pores were assumed to be cylindrical in this study suppose 1 f s ρ 2 c c is the conversion coefficient matching the following relationship 3 t 2 c r eq 3 shows that t 2 is proportional to the pore radius i e the t 2 value on the abscissa indicates the pore size that is the larger the t 2 value the larger the pore size the signal intensity on the ordinate represents the number of pores the larger the signal intensity the more pores with corresponding size liu et al rao et al 2019 sun et al 2020a wang et al 2018 therefore the pore size distribution could be determined in light of the t 2 distribution firstly the t 2 distribution curves of the water saturated samples can be determined furthermore the content and pore size of pore water can be calculated based on the peak area and t 2 value in the t 2 distribution curve of water and pce saturated samples then the change and distribution of water in water and pce saturated samples can be monitored and recorded by the nmr test under different ft cycles and by subtraction method the pce redistribution driven by ft cycles in water and pce saturated samples can be characterized 3 results and discussion 3 1 analysis of t2 distribution curves under different ft cycles fig 2 shows the t 2 distribution curves associated with pce distribution of samples with pce saturation s n 13 56 to 72 05 after different ft cycles based on the subtraction of the t2 distribution curve of samples saturated with water and pce and the same sample saturated with water as can be seen from fig 2 the t 2 distribution curve varies significantly with the ft cycles for all samples since on one hand the t 2 distribution curve reflects the distribution of water and the t 2 value is proportional to the pore size in which water is located the larger t2 value is the larger pore size is on the other hand the accumulated t 2 values of samples with pce saturation s n 13 56 to 72 05 are independence of the ft cycles see supporting information in fig s4 this variation of the t 2 distribution curve provides strong evidence for the inner redistribution of water and pce due to the ft cycles based on the t 2 value the pore size in porous media can be classified into three categories bayer et al 2010 bird et al 2005 todoruk et al 2003 water in micropores was assigned as t 2 distribution of 60 ms t 2 60 ms mesopore water was reported to be contained in peaks ranging between 60 and 300 ms 60 ms t 2 300 ms macropore water had peaks with a t 2 distribution of 300 ms t 2 greater than 300 ms it should be mentioned that the t 2 distribution curve with 0 ft cycle represents the initial distribution of water without the influence of freezing and thawing in the pce water glass beads system thus comparing the t 2 distribution curves of the water saturated sample to the t 2 distribution curves with 0 ft cycle see supporting information in fig s5 it can be found that on the one hand most of the t 2 values of the water saturated samples are above 60 ms indicating that the number of macropores and mesopores in the samples is much larger than the number of micropores on the other hand the peak area of the t 2 distribution curve of more than 60 ms was significantly reduced after the injection of pce indicating that the injected pce was mainly in macropores and mesopores in all samples observation of the variation of the t 2 distribution curves with ft cycles in fig 2 suggested that the pce redistribution is not only related to the pore size of the samples but also to the s n as can be seen from fig 2 the variation of the t 2 distribution curve with ft cycles was clearly observed in both mesopores and macropores while a slight variation was captured in micropores this indicates that the pce redistribution was caused by transport between mesopores and macropores since all samples were prepared as a closed system where no drainage of water and pce occurs during ft cycles it can be seen from fig 2 that the amplitude of the variation of the t 2 distribution curves increased with decreasing s n the observed changes in the amplitude of the t 2 distribution curves were significant at the smaller s n and became trivial when s n was larger another finding in fig 2 is that with successive ft cycles the changing trend of t 2 distribution curves is basically the same for all samples i e the pce increases in the macropores while decreases in the mesopores with increasing ft cycles a slight change of pce was observed in the micropores this is evident that the number of ft cycles has a significant influence on the redistribution of pce in the porous media 3 2 analysis of pce redistribution based on magnetic resonance imaging mri in terms of the process of magnetic resonance imaging mri the gradient pulse sequence of the emitted electromagnetic wave excited by an external gradient magnetic field is used to spatially position the object after selecting the layer gradient phase encoding and frequency encoding a data matrix is formed and finally a pixel matrix is formed by image reconstruction which represents the cross sectional view of the sample in a particular layer sun et al 2020b the darker the pixel color the more fluid is contained in the pores and the more pronounced the pores are the larger the corresponding pixel value which directly reflects the distribution of pores in the porous media in this study the 1h mri images of samples were also acquired on macromr12 150h i low field 1h nmr analyzer spin echo se imaging sequence was used to obtain weighted images of samples for all images the slice width and slice gap were 3 0 mm and 2 0 mm respectively with offset slice of 0 0 mm echo time te and repetition time tr of weighted image were 20 ms and 500 ms the images obtained from mri were processed with two software unified mapping and pseudocolor processing after unified mapping and pseudocolor processing the gray level images were changed to color images fig 3 shows the proton density weighted images of the longitudinal section in the middle layer of the samples under different ft cycles and the color shows the relative strength range of 1h in the pores the blue color in the images represents pce and a solid skeleton and shows no imaging signal while the yellow color indicates the high proton density which shows a relatively strong 1h signal in fig 3 it is clear that the proton density in the middle layer of the samples treated with different capillary numbers shows significant changes after ft cycles moreover the blue area representing the pce and the solid skeleton also shows some differences with different ft cycles in terms of location and area it can be concluded that the ft cycles could cause the redistribution of pce in the middle layer of the samples to show more clearly that ft cycles cause a redistribution of pce in the middle layer of the samples the subtraction images were determined between different ft cycles fig 4 shows the proton density weighted images of the samples after image subtraction between different ft cycles as can be seen from the fig 4 all subtraction images have different degrees of proton density distribution from this we can infer that the pce in the middle layer have been redistributed after the ft cycles in the samples 3 3 dependence of pore scale pce redistribution on ft cycles the redistribution of water and pce due to the ft cycles was confirmed by the t2 distribution curves and the proton density weighted images as shown in sec 3 1 and sec 3 2 this redistribution shows a strong dependence on both the initial distribution of pce and the number of ft cycles here we further investigated the dependence of the pce redistribution on ft cycles with respect to the previous pore size categories in order to determine the contribution of pore size to the redistribution of water and pce the pore size dependent pce fractions and the pore size dependent pce saturation were introduced the pore size dependent pce fractions in the different pores e g micropores mesopores and macropores were determined for all samples by the ratio of the area under the curve of the corresponding pore size to the total area of the t 2 distribution curve it should be noted that the sum of the pore size dependent pce fractions in the three different pore categories was constant and equal to 1 during the ft cycles because no drainage of water and pce occurred during the ft cycles the pore size dependent pce saturation in the corresponding pore size s n i was calculated by 4 s n i v n i v v i i m i c m e s a n d m a c where v v i and v n i represent the pore volume and the pce volume in the micropores mesopores or macropores respectively the s n i can be determined by the ratio of the area under the curve of the corresponding pore size to the total area of the t 2 distribution curve of the water saturated samples when the s n i was equal to 1 the pce saturated the corresponding pore category fig 5 shows the pore size dependent pce saturations and fractions in the micropores mesopores and macropores during ft cycles for pce saturations s n 13 56 to 72 05 it is clear from fig 5 that the pore size dependent pce saturations and fractions change to different extent with increasing ft cycles for all samples for all samples the s n mac in the macropores exhibited a positive correlation with increasing ft cycles while the s n mes in the mesopores showed a negative correlation with increasing ft cycles however the s n mic in the micropores was almost unchanged with increasing ft cycles this suggests that the contribution of the micropores of samples to pce redistribution driven by ft cycles is much smaller than that of the mesopores and macropores all pore size dependent pce saturations were 1 after 30 ft cycles indicating that the water occurred in different pore categories the detailed data of s n i for all samples can be found in supporting information in table s4 it was also found that the variation of sn in macropores and mesopores with ft cycles increased as the sn decreased this indicates that the relatively high water saturation of the samples enhances the redistribution of pce driven by ft cycles the fraction of pores occupied by pce of all samples after different ft cycles in fig 5 was also analyzed it was found that with increasing ft cycles the pore size dependent pce fractions in the macropores first increased and then gradually tended to be stable also the fluctuations of the pore size dependent pce fractions in the micropores and mesopores was small therefore it can be concluded that the influence of ft cycles on the redistribution of pce was not constant but history dependent and related to the distribution and saturation of pce in porous media in other words the redistribution of pce driven by ft cycles could be insignificant if the redistribution of pce was driven by multiple ft cycles this is important and constructive for predicting the fate and transport of napls contamination in seasonally freezing and frozen soils because the redistribution of pce driven by ft cycles could be insignificant after enough ft cycles comparing fig 5 a b with fig 5 e f it is clear that the pore size dependent pce fractions changed significantly when the pce saturation of the samples was relatively low while the pore size dependent pce fractions changed slightly with increasing ft cycles when the pce saturation of the samples was relatively high this indicates that the pce saturation of the samples has a significant influence on the redistribution of pce during the ft cycles this will be discussed further in sec 3 4 3 4 correlation analysis of redistribution rates and freezing behavior to quantitatively investigate the influence of ft cycles on the redistribution of pce the redistribution rate r t was introduced based on amplitude change of the t 2 distribution curves the r t was determined as follows 5 r t s ftx s f t 0 s s s f t 0 100 where sft0 is the peak area in the t 2 distribution curves of the samples at 0 ft cycles sftx is the peak area in the t 2 distribution curves of the samples at the ft cycles ss is the total peak areas of the t 2 distribution curves of the water saturated sample figs 6 and 7 show the relationship between r t and n in micropores mesopores and macropores for different pce saturations of the samples from figs 6 and 7 it can be seen that for all samples the r t is much smaller in the micropores than in the macropores and mesopores indicating that the freezing induced transport behavior of pce occurred mainly in the macropores and mesopores a simple linear relationship was proposed to fit the data in fig 6 as follows 6 r t α n β n 0 where n is the number of freeze thaw cycles α and β are the slope and intercept of the curve the parameter α reflects the rate of change of the redistribution rate with the ft cycles although a simple linear relationship between r t and n may not be sufficient to characterize and predict the freezing induced transport behavior of pce this simple linear relationship could be considered as a metric for characterizing the magnitude of nonlinearity of the freezing induced transport behavior of pce as can be seen from figs 6 and 7 for the samples with low pce saturation e g s n 13 56 and 13 56 the r t in the macropores and mesopores generally showed a linear relationship whereas the r t in the micropores generally showed a non linear relationship as s n increases r t and n deviate from the linear relationship in all pore categories this non linear relationship between r t and n could be resulted from the soil and pce properties initial napl water saturation and freezing speed barnes and filler 2003 chuvilin et al 2001a singh and niven 2013 there are three mechanisms e g freezing induced expulsion freezing indued cutoff and ganglion contraction that cause mobilization and redistribution of pce during ft cycles among these mechanisms both the capillary pressure and the freezing induced pressure due to water expansion play important roles in the mobilization and redistribution of pce during ft cycles the freezing induced pressure δ p n is related to water saturation and is given by niven and singh 2008 7 δ p n 1 κ t ln s n 1 s n s n 1 s n ρ w ρ ice 1 where κt is the isothermal compressibility and ρw and ρice are the densities of water and ice respectively the densities of water and ice are 999 8 and 916 7 kg m 3 at 0 c respectively niven and singh 2008 for pce the isothermal compressibility is 1061 6 tpa 1 nath and anita 2000 it should be noted that although the freezing induced pressure can be determined using eq 7 the determined freezing induced pressure by eq 7 is based on the saturation of the entire samples and thus represents the freezing induced pressure in the bulk and not on pore scale since the mobilization and redistribution of pce between different pore categories have been observed the current interest is to investigate the mechanism of mobilization and redistribution of pce between different pore categories therefore eq 7 was modified to characterize the freezing induced pressure in the different pore categories 8 δ p n i 1 κ t ln s n i 1 s n i s n i 1 s n i ρ w ρ ice 1 i m i c m e s a n d m a c eq 7 provides the freezing induced pressure in the different pore categories the capillary pressure which is the pressure difference across the interface of two different fluids can be described by the young laplace equation niven 2006b pickell et al 1966 9 δ p c σ 1 r 1 1 r 2 2 h σ where σ is the surface or interfacial tension between the two fluids and σ 45 dynes cm demond and lindner 1993 imhoff et al 1995 the r 1 and r 2 are the orthogonal principal radii of curvature of the interface at any point h is the mean interfacial curvature considering the capillary pressure associated with entrapment of pce in porous media niven and singh 2008 the eq 9 can be rewritten as follow 10 δ p c 2 h σ 2 σ r where the r is the pore size of the samples since the capillary pressure provides a resisting force for the entrapment of pce in the pores and the freezing induced pressure is a driving force for the mobilization and redistribution of pce during the ft cycles the balance between the capillary pressure and the freezing induced pressure could ultimately determine the mobilization and redistribution of pce during the ft cycles here a dimensionless pressure ratio δp was introduced to evaluate the influence of the balance between the capillary pressure and the freezing induced pressure on the redistribution of pce during the ft cycles the dimensionless pressure ratio δp was given by 11 δ p δ p n i δ p c r 2 σ κ t ln s n i 1 s n i s n i 1 s n i ρ w ρ ice 1 table 2 shows the determined δp of the samples in micropores mesopores and macropores during the ft cycles overall the determined δp for all pore categories are much larger than 1 0 indicating that the freezing induced pressure is much higher than the pressure associated the entrapment of pce in porous media during the ft cycles especially the δp in all samples is much larger in macropores than in mesopores and micropores the δp also explains the dramatic changes in the redistribution rate r t in in the different pore categories in figs 6 and 7 the magnitude of δp shows a positive correlation with the redistribution rate r t for all pore categories in table 2 it was found that the δp decreased with increasing number of ft cycles for the macropores this indicates that the remobilization and redistribution of pce in the macropores gradually tends to be a steady state although the pce water system in the micropores and mesopores is still unstable this finding extends the previous study that showed that the spatial distribution of napls ganglia was in an unsteady state after 10 ft cycles singh et al 2011 the observed occurrence of steady state distribution of napls driven by ft cycles is important for predicting the behavior of napls spills and risk assessment of napls contaminated sites in cold regions 4 conclusions in this study pce redistribution driven by ft cycles in porous media was experimentally confirmed and investigated the t 2 distribution of low field 1h nmr was proposed as a promising technique to quantitatively determine the pce redistribution driven by the ft cycles in porous media the proton density weighted images based on nmr also provided visual evidence of the pce redistribution driven by the ft cycles especially the freezing induced pce interactions between the different pore categories of the samples were identified the main findings of this study can be summarized as follows 1 pce redistribution driven by the ft cycles is related not only to the pore size but also to the pce saturation of the samples and is significantly influenced by the number of ft cycles however pce redistribution driven by the ft cycles is history dependent and is related to the initial pce distribution and saturation in porous media 2 the contribution of micropores to pce redistribution driven by ft cycles is much less remarkable than that of mesopores and macropores at low pce saturation e g s n 13 56 and 13 56 the redistribution rate in the macropores and mesopores overall exhibits a linear relationship while a non linear relationship in micropores as s n increased the non linear pattern tends to be prominent for all pore categories 3 both capillary pressure and freezing induced pressure due to water expansion play important roles in the mobilization and redistribution of pce during ft cycles the introduced dimensionless pressure ratio δp can explain the dramatic changes in the redistribution rate r t in the different pore categories the δp decreased with the number of ft cycles for the macropores suggesting that the remobilization and redistribution of pce in the macropores gradually weakens although the pce water system in the micropores and mesopores is still

3194,with advancement of remote sensing techniques remote sensing drought indices have been widely used for drought monitoring however the monitoring accuracy of a specific drought index regionally varies considering the deficiency of existing drought indices in reflecting vegetation growth here we propose a modified drought severity index mdsi with local optimization method constrained by the inclusion of vegetation greenness crop water shortage canopy temperature vegetation structure and physiological status we evaluated drought monitoring performance of mdsi across china and detected high correlations between mdsi and soil moisture sm standardized precipitation index at a 3 month scale spi 3 actual drought affected areas ada evidencing higher drought performance of mdsi when compared to 8 widely used drought indices besides mdsi performed better in monitoring agricultural drought we found amplifying short term drought intensity in the future ecological restoration and cultivated land reclamation can alleviate drought effects however urbanization can potentially intensify droughts how to adapt human behavior to droughts is a challenging task keywords modified drought severity index drought monitoring soil moisture drought affected croplands spatiotemporal pattern data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the united nations proposed sustainable development goals sdgs in 2015 which include 17 goals and 169 targets droughts directly exacerbates water stress and hence threatens food security and causes ecological crisis and poverty and hampers sustainable development pradhan et al 2017 zhang and yuan 2020 drought is usually viewed as one of the costliest natural hazards over the globe mishra and singh 2010 zargar et al 2011 zhang et al 2015 shen et al 2022 causing damaging impacts on society and eco environment zhang et al 2017 global economic losses caused by droughts have been estimated to be as high as 6 to 8 billion us dollars annually far larger than those caused by other meteorological disasters wilhite 2000 furthermore accelerated hydrological cycle can be expected in the backdrop of global warming allen and ingram 2002 zhang et al 2013 which potentially increases the frequency and or intensity of climate extremes at regional and global scales such as floods and droughts li et al 2015 hu et al 2018 therefore to achieve sustainable development in china renders it necessary to develop scientific mitigation strategies for drought risks battisti and naylor 2009 he et al 2017a zhang et al 2019 drought indices have been widely used in the analysis and monitoring of drought events um et al 2018 the first step for drought analysis is to develop an appropriate drought monitoring index coats mankin 2016 zhang et al 2018a due to the complexity of droughts there are multiple drought indices e g sun et al 2017 compared to meteorological drought index remote sensing monitoring provides

evapotranspiration pet and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi dsi has been widely used in drought monitoring e g um et al 2018 however ndvi cannot well reflect the growth status of vegetation

of vegetation canopy kogan et al 2012 bokusheva et al 2016 li et al 2020 leaf area index lai can well reflect vegetation structure and physiological parameters and some previous studies found decreased lai due to water shortage fisher et al 2007 yazdani et al 2007 mu et al 2013 compared dsi drought severity index and pdsi palmer drought severity index during the growing season and evaluated the applicability of dsi in drought monitoring but did not evaluate dsi from multiple time scale perspectives from the perspective of vegetation growth it is critical to consider responses of vegetation canopy temperature vegetation structure and physiological parameters to regional agricultural drought in addition dsi is the sum of crop water stress index et pet and vegetation greenness index ndvi on the basis of equal weight however obvious spatial heterogeneity in climate changes may differentiate combination values of different regional weights hence calculation of dsi should include multiple vegetation related limiting factors and weights of each vegetation related limiting factors in different regions to address these issues the objective of this study is to develop and evaluate a modified drought severity index mdsi based on remote sensing data for agricultural drought monitoring under different underlying surface conditions the constrained optimization method was adopted to decide the local optimal weights for mdsi across china powell 1978 hao et al 2015 our approach uses local optimal weights to integrate single agricultural drought related variables local optimal weights were selected to use regionally varying weights to reflect spatial heterogeneity of droughts the mdsi was integrated with agricultural drought related variables such as vegetation greenness water stress of crops vegetation canopy temperature vegetation structure and physiology derived from modis and glass considering that standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei has the advantage over standardized precipitation index spi in the mathematical calculation of water balance and over pdsi in multi scalar analysis spei at 3 month scale spei 3 can reveal regional agricultural drought to a certain extent and spei has been widely applied in drought monitoring across china vicente serrano et al 2010 seibert et al 2012 beguería et al 2014 yu et al 2014 xu et al 2015 ye et al 2019a thus this study used spei 3 as the in situ index and agricultural drought related variables to determine the local optimal weight of each variable and calculate mdsi by a constrained optimization method the objectives of this study therefore were to 1 develop mdsi for monitoring agricultural drought in china 2 compare avi anomaly vegetation index huete 1988 sun et al

methods the framework shown in fig 2 describes overall processes of developing an agricultural drought monitoring model and analyzing its applicability based on modis data and glass lai data in this study 3 1 meteorological drought index the spi and spei were introduced by mckee et al 1993 and vicente serrano et al 2010 respectively the 1 month spi spei has been used to monitor meteorological drought 3 month spi spei can reflect soil moisture changes and the 12 month spi spei the long term changes in run off groundwater and freshwater storage mishra and singh 2010 therefore we applied spei 3 as the in situ index and the variables related to crop growth were used to calculate mdsi by a constrained optimization method spi 3 was used to verify the sensitivity of mdsi to precipitation 3 2 modified drought severity index mdsi there are 8 widely used dis i e avi vci vswi tci cwsi tvdi dsi and vhi which can be categorized into three groups 1 drought indices considering vegetation growth such as avi vci vswi tci tvdi and vhi 2 drought index considering crop water stress only such as cwsi and 3 drought indices considering vegetation growth and sm such as dsi dsi combines ndvi et and pet where ndvi describes vegetation growth changes the ratio of et to pet better reflects the energy and water exchange among vegetation soil and atmosphere and can describe crop water stress allen et al 2011 cooke et al 2012 park et al 2016 huang et al 2018 more detailed descriptions can be found in table 1 jackson et al 1981 1988 chen et al 1994 carlson et al 1994 kogan 1995b sandholt et al 2002 kogan 2012 mu et al 2013 the algorithm of mdsi is as follows the first step is to calculate the index reflecting the greenness vci temperature tci vegetation structure and physiological parameters lap of the vegetation canopy 1 vci ndvi i ndvi min ndvi max ndvi min 2 tci lst max lst i lst max lst min 3 lap lai i lai lai while ndvi is the normalized difference vegetation index lst is the surface temperature lai is the leaf area index i is the value of the variable during the ith period within a certain year max is the maximum value of the variable in the ith period within a certain year min is the minimum value of the variable in the ith period within a certain year is the multi year average value of the variable during the ith period within a certain year the second step is to standardize vci tci lap and et pet 4 z index index i index σ index where index i is the value of the variable during the ith period of within a certain year σ index is the standard deviation of index and index is the multi year average of the index variable during the ith period within a certain year z index is vci tci lap and et pet standardized by the z score z vci denotes the greenness of the vegetation canopy the larger the z vci value the better the vegetation growth condition z tci describes the temperature of the vegetation canopy the larger the z tci value the weaker the effect of temperature stress on vegetation growth z lap indicates the structure and physiological parameters of vegetation the larger the z lap value the stronger the photosynthesis of vegetation z et pet expresses crop water stress information such that the larger the z et pet value the weaker the vegetation under water stress taking spei 3 as the in situ index we summed up z vci z tci z lap and z et pet based on the optimal weight from the constrained optimization method and then we obtained the mdsi as 5 f x y m a x e x μ x y μ y σ x σ y x s p e i 3 7 o α z vci β z tci γ z lap 1 α β γ z et pet 8 0 α 1 0 β 1 0 γ 1 9 mdsi o i o σ o while f x y is the highest correlation between x and y y is the comprehensive standard score derived from z vci z tci z lap and z et pet x is the in situ index spei 3 σ y is the standard deviation of y y i is value of the variable during the ith period within a certain year y is the multi year average value of the y variable during the ith period within a certain year mdsi is a modified version of dsi positive mdsi shows wet conditions and higher mdsi shows wetter conditions and vice versa however one issue about the constrained optimization method is regionally varying weights irrespective of regional differences across the underlying surface therefore based on the pixel scale and in situ drought index this study calculated the optimal weights of different agricultural drought related variables to improve the regional applicability of constrained optimization method both mdsi and dsi are defined by the z score the mdsi proposed in this study follows the normal distribution average value is 0 standard deviation is 1 since they have the same drought and humidity monitoring results the same drought and humidity classification standards can be used zhang and yamaguchi 2014 table 2 3 3 t test of the correlation coefficient the correlation coefficient is a statistical indicator showing the degree of correlation between two variables in this study we used the correlation coefficient to quantify the correlation between dis and sm and between spi 3 and ada at the pixel scale the significance of the correlation coefficient was evaluated using the t test 3 4 sen s slope and modified mann kendall trend test sen s slope is a robust non parametric statistical method for the detection of trends and is widely used for meteorological hydrological and vegetation data theil 1992 the modified mann kendall test mmk hamed and rao 1998 daufresne et al 2009 zhang et al 2012 was employed and more detailed algorithm of the mmk can be referred to daufresne et al 2009 based on the mmk altman and bland 2011 and sen s slope trends of mdsi were evaluated and subdivided into seven grades table 3 3 5 hurst exponent the persistency of mdsi across china was evaluated using the hurst exponent hurst 1951 based on the rescaled range r s analysis method with respect to long range correlation the hurst exponent ranges from 0 to 1 with h 0 5 indicating random nature and h 0 5 persistent tendency of the current changes the greater the h value the stronger the persistency of the time series 0 h 0 5 indicates that the future changes are opposite of the past i e the anti persistency the smaller the h value the stronger the anti persistency hurst 1951 according to the hurst exponent and sen s slope the persistency of mdsi was divided into five grades table 4 fig 2 demonstrates the entire analysis procedure of the current study 4 results 4 1 applicability of mdsi in drought monitoring across china 4 1 1 remote sensing dis vs sm relations we evaluated applicability of 9 drought indices in drought monitoring across china fig s1 and found that dis considering et and pet such as cwsi dsi and mdsi had higher correlation coefficients with sm than other dis mdsi had higher correlation coefficients with sm than did other dis all dis monitored sm changes in the southwest of slrb the yrb and the northeast of irb refer to fig 1d for the location of major river basins while mdsi described sm changes better than other dis at a larger spatial scale it was also found that relatively poor drought monitoring by dis in the south of the yzrb and mdsi had high correlation with sm furthermore comparison between cwsi dsi and mdsi indicated that significant correlation between mdsi 97 92 and sm was much higher than that between cwsi 46 36 and dsi 46 04 in the vegetation coverage area across china fig 3 correlations between dis and sm for specific river basins across china fig s2 indicated better monitoring performance of mdsi within 9 major river basins t test 2 12 p 0 05 except mdsi the other dis poorly monitored sm changes over the hrb prb swrb and serb t test value 2 12 p 0 05 for areas with different vegetation types fig s3 mdsi monitored well the sm of regions with all vegetation types t test 2 12 p 0 05 and especially the sm of the grassland crops and forest t test value 2 92 p 0 01 thus it was evident that mdsi compared to other dis had monitored sm changes well across china and deemed to be the right choice for drought monitoring practice 4 1 2 remote sensing dis vs spi 3 relations we quantified relations between dis and spi 3 and the significance of correlation was evaluated using the t test method fig s4 it was found that dis considering ndvi such as avi vci and vswi had lower correlation coefficients with spi 3 than had other dis the correlation between dis and spi 3 was similar to sm mdsi had shown advantages over other dis in terms of its relation with spi 3 in most phases expected in autumn and growing seasons the spatial pattern of relations between 9 dis and spi 3 during the growing season fig 4 showed that mdsi did better in describing spi 3 changes than other dis across china it is worth noting that mdsi can also effectively monitor drought changes in areas with sparse meteorological observation sites overcoming the spatial discontinuity of meteorological drought monitoring based on spi 3 such as the qinghai tibet plateau and north china similar to agricultural drought monitoring mdsi had relatively satisfactorily monitored meteorological drought in the south of the yzrb dsi vhi and mdsi better reflected the impact of precipitation deficit on agricultural drought compared with other dis significantly related stations between mdsi 68 32 and spi 3 were much higher than those of dsi 32 35 and vhi 29 74 for selected 1957 meteorological stations across china fig 3 for monitoring performance of dis in different river basins fig s5 mdsi adequately monitored spi 3 changes in 7 major river basins t test value 2 12 p 0 05 except prb and swrb however the meteorological drought monitored by other dis was more frustrating than mdsi in the prb and swrb for monitoring meteorological drought in regions with different vegetation types fig s6 mdsi monitored the meteorological drought of regions with all vegetation types t test 2 12 p 0 05 especially the meteorological drought of the grassland crops and forest t test value 2 92 p 0 01 thus mdsi had a more widespread and reliable applicability in monitoring meteorological drought across china 4 1 3 time lag responses of mdsi and other dis to spi 3 we analyzed correlation between dis and cumulative precipitation at time lags of 0 12 months wang et al 2003 the month of maximum correlation coefficient between drought index of the growing season scale and average spi 3 in the first 12 months is the lag time fig 5 shows the spatial heterogeneity of lag time in response of dis to spi 3 change we found a considerable lag time in response of agricultural drought to the spi 3 change comparison of lag times in response of dis to the spi 3 change indicated that dis considering vegetation greenness and canopy temperature tvdi vhi and mdsi usually had a shorter lag time than other dis particularly in yzrb hurb and prb the dis which takes into account crop water stress or vegetation greenness avi vci vswi cwsi and dsi had a longer lag time in their response to the spi 3 change especially in the yrb analysis showed that dis considering onefold factors usually had longer lag time in response to dis to spi 3 change however the lag time of mdsi 58 25 and spi 3 was 3 months which was higher than tvdi 53 45 and vhi 47 32 for selected 1957 meteorological stations across china fig 5 indicating that mdsi captured well the agrometeorological drought it can be seen from fig 4 and fig 6 that the correlation between dis and spi 3 during the growing season increased significantly given the consideration of lag time while the spatial pattern of correlation was similar before and after the consideration of lag time given the consideration of lag time the correlation between spi 3 and mdsi was still the highest when compared to other dis indicating that mdsi better monitored agricultural drought from the viewpoint of meteorological droughts for correlation between dis and spi 3 for different river basins figs s5 s7 and for regions with different vegetation types figs s6 s8 different correlations between drought indices and precipitation were observed the correlation between dis and spi 3 in the yrb slrb and irb increased greatly which indicated that the lack of precipitation in these basins had a greater impact on the development of agricultural economy the correlation between dis and spi 3 in hurb and harb was remote which indicated that the occurrence of agricultural drought in these basins was greatly affected by the precipitation in the same period from the viewpoint of vegetation types before and after considering lag time figs s6 s8 impacts on correlations between dis and spi 3 were small indicating that the lag time in response of agricultural drought to precipitation was heavily influenced by the location but not mainly by vegetation type considering the impact of irrigation on agriculture yu et al 2019 we computed maximum correlation coefficients between dis and spi 3 for different irrigation areas it can be seen from fig s9 that for different irrigation areas the maximum correlation coefficients of agricultural drought response to meteorological drought followed the following order i e irrigated single crop rainfed crop irrigated double crop irrigated triple crop comparison of the t test values of the correlation coefficients between mdsi and other dis and spi 3 in different irrigation areas after considering the lag time showed that lower drought monitoring performance was observed for drought monitoring indices given irrigated single crop even so mdsi still showed an advantage over drought indices in monitoring agricultural droughts in different agricultural areas 4 1 4 correlation between dis and drought affected areas previous studies mostly focused on the verification of remote sensing drought indices using sm precipitation or meteorological drought indices sun et al 2017 zhang et al 2018c jiao et al 2019 yu et al 2019 li et al 2020 correlation coefficients were computed between the drought affected area of each province from the national bureau of statistics and the average of the nine annual scale dis fig 7 it can be seen from fig 7 that except for tci and tvdi drought indices considered in this study successfully monitored agricultural drought affected area over 50 of the provinces in china while mdsi monitored well agriculture drought affected areas in all the provinces in addition dsi vhi and mdsi monitored the total drought affected area over 40 of the provinces while mdsi monitored well the total drought affected area over 50 of the provinces results indicated that mdsi considering greenness and temperature of the vegetation canopy structure and physiological parameters of vegetation and water shortage degree of crops better captured crop yields and was of considerable applicability for agricultural drought monitoring 4 2 spatiotemporal pattern of mdsi droughts across china during 2001 to 2018 4 2 1 temporal changes of annual droughts across china we analyzed drought changes across china using the mdsi variation within nine river basins and related cumulative anomalies of mdsi it can be seen from fig 8 that an extremely significant wetting tendency was observed in yzrb yrb prb and slrb with a long term trend 0 25 10a meanwhile a significant wetting tendency was found in the serb with long term trends of 0 27 10a insignificant wetting tendency was identified in hurb harb and swrb the cumulative anomalies of mdsi decreased and then increased in the yzrb the yrb the prb the slrb and the serb specifically cumulative anomalies of mdsi reached the trough value in 2009 in the yrb the slrb the irb and the serb indicating that 2009 was the time point for transition from drying to wetting conditions for these basins similarly the transition from drying to wetting conditions in the yzrb and prb occurred in 2013 4 2 2 trends of droughts across china according to table 3 the change trend of mdsi was divided and the results are shown in fig 9 at the monthly scale a slight drying trend was found in the xilin gol grassland in march and the drying tendency may have a serious impact on the greening of grass the periods of january to march and july to august witnessed intensifying droughts over the hurb particularly for the period from july to august while the period of july to august was the critical period for summer maize and rice the period from november to february of the following year witnessed a drying tendency in the hinterland of the qinghai tibet plateau a remarkable wetting tendency was found during may to september over middle and upper reaches of the yrb the period from september to january witnessed a considerable wetting tendency in regions south to the yzrb the spatial pattern of trends in seasonal droughts was similar to that of monthly droughts drought trends during the growing season and at the annual scale were consistent in spatial pattern with the trends of autumn droughts implying a larger contribution of autumn trends to trends of droughts at the annual scale during the growing season changes in the underlying surface have an impact on the changing trend of regional drought we set up four scenarios and control scenarios unchanged area according to the spatial distribution of the transformed land use pattern fig 1b then calculated the average of trends in monthly droughts for five scenarios fig 10 the trend values of mdsi in the yrb the hurb and the harb were significantly higher than those in the unchanged area showing that ecological restoration helped mitigate droughts fig 10 nevertheless the trend of mdsi in the irb was significantly lower than that in the regions with unchanged area since the irb is mostly the pastoral area and overgrazing leads to further deterioration of the ecological environment qiu et al 2020 for drought trends influenced by urbanization in the yzrb the yrb the harb the prb the serb mdsi over the urbanized regions was lower than that over the regions with unchanged area this result indicates that urbanization can potentially intensify droughts for the cultivated land reclamation area in the yrb and irb the increased irrigation consumption can help mitigate agricultural droughts in the regions with grassland degraded grasslands are found mainly in the irb fig 2b d and the intensified drought in turn will enhance grassland degradation and reduce grassland productivity mainly in the xilin gol grasslands in march and in the qinghai tibetan plateau from november to february 4 2 3 persistency of droughts across china according to table 3 the change trend of mdsi was divided and the results are shown in fig 11 it can be seen from fig 11 that general anti persistency of droughts was observed across china indicating that the tendency of drought in the near future was opposite to that in the past at the monthly scale in the near future most areas of the xilin gol grassland was dominated by a drying tendency from june to february meanwhile the periods of july witnessed a drying tendency in the paddy areas of the hurb and future drought would potentially be intensified the periods of may to september witnessed intensified droughts in the slrb and the yrb in the near future in addition the seasonal and monthly drought trends had a strong similarity in the spatial distribution while the spatial pattern of persistency of drought during the growing season and that at the annual scale was more consistent with that of summer drought therefore the persistency of summer drought contributed the most to the persistency of droughts during the growing season and that at the annual scale fig 11 we also analyzed the hurst exponents of msdi over five scenarios from 2000 to 2018 showing the impacts of land use changes on drought persistency fig 1b it can be seen from fig 12 that the average value of the hurst exponent of the nine major river basins in china ranged from 0 40 to 0 50 and droughts within these 9 major river basins generally had weak anti persistency the degraded grassland enhanced anti persistency of drought mainly referring to irb droughts over the regions with urban expansion areas and cultivated land reclamation areas were subject to weakened anti persistency to a certain extent from the hurst variation range under the five scenarios indicating that changes in the underlying features of the yzrb the irb and the swrb remarkably modified the persistency of drought 5 discussion our overall goal was to enhance the accuracy of drought monitoring by developing an mdsi that can be applied across countries with large areas and it was suitable for areas with sparse stations a tremendous amount of studies has reached a consensus that constructing drought indices based on univariate or bivariate is likely to be insufficient for accurate drought monitoring huang et al 2015 chen et al 2020 in addition how to effectively integrate different drought related variables is the key to construct comprehensive drought index however previous works mostly used fixed weights to blend different drought related variables rhee et al 2010 hao et al 2015 sun et al 2017 which ignored the impact of regional differences on weights in this study mdsi was developed based on the constrained optimization method to calculate the assigned weights for inputs at multi temporal scales to reflect the agricultural drought information and verified its applicability at the national level figs 3 4 7 in general ndvi based dis poorly monitored droughts in southern china where forests and crops were dominant with abundant precipitation and strong vegetation transpiration li et al 2017a li et al 2017b however ndvi constructed by the visible light and near infrared monitored the health of vegetation through chlorophyll content but could not provide timely information about energy and water exchange among vegetation soil and atmosphere olsen et al 2015 in addition previous works have confirmed that there is a strong linear relationship between ndvi and lai fensholt et al 2004 qiao et al 2019 but some studies show that the impact of climate change on ndvi and lai has a certain degree of difference myneni et al 2007 lee et al 2013 and there is the spatial heterogeneity in the impact of lai change on terrestrial water storage in china tao et al 2020 given the limitation of dsi when used for drought monitoring at a large scale with complex underlying surface mdsi combines multiple vegetation growth limiting factors thereby leading to the best performance among dis xu et al 2018 found that the response of vegetation index to long term drought was mainly in northeast china and yrb which is similar to our results as shown in fig 5 the main reason is that afforestation caused high water holding capacity of the soil and short term increase or decrease of precipitation could not trigger significant sm changes in yrb while the northeastern and southern coastal areas of the slrb are dominated by woodlands and shrubs higher vegetation coverage and relative stable ecological environment caused lower responses of dis to precipitation changes he et al 2017b however the lag response of dis for a long time to meteorological drought makes it difficult to assess the impact of insufficient precipitation on vegetation while mdsi has greatly improved in this aspect some researchers have focused on the spatial temporal distribution of drought in china based on the meteorological station data or remote sensing drought index using the palmer drought severity index yan et al 2016 found that an extreme drought event occurred in 2001 and relatively severe droughts occurred in north china which is similar to our results shown in fig 8 the main reason is that the strong la niña phenomenon occurred in 2000 2001 which led to the abundant precipitation in the south and the dry precipitation in the north li et al 2019 in addition based on the integrated surface drought index isdi and modified temperature vegetation drought index mtvdi zhou et al 2017 and zhao et al 2017 found that drought in northeast china and the south of the yzrb showed an obvious decreasing trend in different periods zhu et al 2019 showed that the sm of farmland increased fastest in summer and autumn many studies above have focused on the temporal spatial pattern of drought across the china while there is comparability in the temporal spatial pattern of drought across the china between this study and previous studies the results of the study demonstrated that ecological restoration helped mitigate droughts in huang huai hai plain and a remarkable wetting tendency was found during may to september in the middle and upper reaches of the yrb ye et al 2019b confirmed that ecological restoration has a negative impact on sm in humid and semi humid areas while it has a positive impact on sm in arid and semi arid areas under the influence of china s widespread greening summer precipitation increased in the huang huai hai plain yu et al 2020 however some studies also showed that ecological restoration reduced sm feng et al 2017 li et al 2018b these results suggest that if vegetation greening leads to reduced sm mdsi can overestimate the increase of soil wetness in response to ecological restoration across china in addition urbanized areas have a potentially negative effect on drought mitigation these areas are urbanizing rapidly and the rate of urban expansion exceeds the capacity of the ecological environment leading to the contradiction between people and land liao et al 2020 our study made an improvement of drought severity index dsi and the results could provide references for the development of agricultural drought in china and china s food security in this study the relationship between in situ drought index spei 3 and several factors limiting vegetation growth was considered compared with the application of spei 3 limited to regions with available meteorological ground observations establishing reliable integrated remote sensing based agricultural drought related variables which could be applied in various environmental regions without relying on ground observations was an important avenue for future work ayantobo et al 2017 liu et al 2019 jiao et al 2019 also in situ observations of meteorological variables cannot completely reflect areal drought characteristics sun et al 2017 in addition mdsi has higher spatial resolution than reanalysis data allowing for high spatial resolution agricultural and meteorological drought monitoring however the accuracy of drought monitoring is still affected by terrain snow cover soil water holding capacity and human activities which is also the main reason for the unsatisfactory monitoring in a few areas in addition the hurst exponent is also used to study the persistency of drought but the prediction of future drought has great uncertainty in further studies we will consider the influence of other factors on the accuracy of drought monitoring and try to use a variety of methods to evaluate the future trend of drought 6 conclusion in this study mdsi with vegetation greenness crop water shortage canopy temperature vegetation structure and physiological status as input variables was constructed we compared di and mdsi with sm precipitation and drought affected area in order to evaluate drought monitoring by evidencing the applicability of mdsi in drought monitoring across china based on mdsi we analyzed droughts across china in both space and time the main conclusions can be drawn as follows 1 mdsi described sm changes at a larger spatial scale better than other dis especially in south of the yzrb it has been significantly improved at most time scales mdsi had a higher correlation coefficient with sm spi 3 than other dis and had highest correlation in agricultural regions indicating that mdsi had remarkable advantages over dis in monitoring agricultural droughts besides mdsi can monitor well drought affected areas further corroborating the applicability of mdsi in agricultural drought monitoring across china 2 the nine major river basins in china showed a wetting tendency during 2001 2018 especially in the yzrb yrb prb and slrb xilin gol grasslands underwent a drying tendency in march a wetting tendency can be found mainly in the regions south of the yzrb during september to january droughts across most regions of china are subject to anti persistency showing a drought tendency in the near future may be opposite of the past 3 the relationship between drought trends and changes in the underlying surface showed that grassland degradation in irb intensified drought and enhanced anti persistency of drought the ecological restoration in the huang huai hai plain decreased drought risks rapid urbanization can potentially intensify droughts while the cultivated land reclamation areas of the yrb and irb have promoted drought alleviation 4 degraded grassland enhanced anti persistency of drought mainly refer to irb droughts over the regions with urban expansion areas and cultivated land reclamation areas were subject to weakened anti persistency from the hurst variation range under the five scenarios drought persistency of the yzrb the irb and the swrb is most affected by the change of underlying features credit authorship

3194,with advancement of remote sensing techniques remote sensing drought indices have been widely used for drought monitoring however the monitoring accuracy of a specific drought index regionally varies considering the deficiency of existing drought indices in reflecting vegetation growth here we propose a modified drought severity index mdsi with local optimization method constrained by the inclusion of vegetation greenness crop water shortage canopy temperature vegetation structure and physiological status we evaluated drought monitoring performance of mdsi across china and detected high correlations between mdsi and soil moisture sm standardized precipitation index at a 3 month scale spi 3 actual drought affected areas ada evidencing higher drought performance of mdsi when compared to 8 widely used drought indices besides mdsi performed better in monitoring agricultural drought we found amplifying short term drought intensity in the future ecological restoration and cultivated land reclamation can alleviate drought effects however urbanization can potentially intensify droughts how to adapt human behavior to droughts is a challenging task keywords modified drought severity index drought monitoring soil moisture drought affected croplands spatiotemporal pattern data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the united nations proposed sustainable development goals sdgs in 2015 which include 17 goals and 169 targets droughts directly exacerbates water stress and hence threatens food security and causes ecological crisis and poverty and hampers sustainable development pradhan et al 2017 zhang and yuan 2020 drought is usually viewed as one of the costliest natural hazards over the globe mishra and singh 2010 zargar et al 2011 zhang et al 2015 shen et al 2022 causing damaging impacts on society and eco environment zhang et al 2017 global economic losses caused by droughts have been estimated to be as high as 6 to 8 billion us dollars annually far larger than those caused by other meteorological disasters wilhite 2000 furthermore accelerated hydrological cycle can be expected in the backdrop of global warming allen and ingram 2002 zhang et al 2013 which potentially increases the frequency and or intensity of climate extremes at regional and global scales such as floods and droughts li et al 2015 hu et al

drought indices have been widely used in the analysis and monitoring of drought events um et al 2018 the first step for drought analysis is to develop an appropriate drought monitoring index coats

of vegetation canopy kogan et al 2012 bokusheva et al 2016 li et al 2020 leaf area index lai can well reflect vegetation structure and physiological parameters and some previous studies found decreased lai due to water shortage fisher et al 2007 yazdani et al 2007 mu et al 2013 compared dsi drought severity index and pdsi palmer drought severity index during the growing season and evaluated the applicability of dsi in drought monitoring but did not evaluate dsi from multiple time scale perspectives from the perspective of vegetation growth it is critical to consider responses of vegetation canopy temperature vegetation structure and physiological parameters to regional agricultural drought in addition dsi is the sum of crop water stress index et pet and vegetation greenness index ndvi on the basis of equal weight however obvious spatial heterogeneity in climate changes may differentiate combination values of different regional weights hence calculation of dsi should include multiple vegetation related limiting factors and weights of each vegetation related limiting factors in different regions to address these issues the objective of this study is to develop and evaluate a modified drought severity index mdsi based on remote sensing data for agricultural drought monitoring under different underlying surface conditions the constrained optimization method was adopted to decide the local optimal weights for mdsi across china powell 1978 hao et al 2015 our approach uses local optimal weights to integrate single agricultural drought related variables local optimal weights were selected to use regionally varying weights to reflect spatial heterogeneity of droughts the mdsi was integrated with agricultural drought related variables such as vegetation greenness water stress of crops vegetation canopy temperature vegetation structure and physiology derived from modis and glass considering that standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei has the advantage over standardized precipitation index spi in the mathematical calculation of water balance and over pdsi in multi scalar analysis spei at 3 month scale spei 3 can reveal regional agricultural drought to a certain extent and spei has been widely applied in drought monitoring across china vicente serrano et al 2010 seibert et al 2012 beguería et al 2014 yu et al 2014 xu et al 2015 ye et al 2019a thus this study used spei 3 as the in situ index and agricultural drought related variables to determine the local optimal weight of each variable and calculate mdsi by a constrained optimization method the objectives of this study therefore were to 1 develop mdsi for monitoring agricultural drought in china 2 compare avi anomaly vegetation index huete 1988 sun et al

methods the framework shown in fig 2 describes overall processes of developing an agricultural drought monitoring model and analyzing its applicability based on modis data and glass lai data in this study 3 1 meteorological drought index the spi and spei were introduced by mckee et al 1993 and vicente serrano et al 2010 respectively the 1 month spi spei has been used to monitor meteorological drought 3 month spi spei can reflect soil moisture changes and the 12 month spi spei the long term changes in run off groundwater and freshwater storage mishra and singh 2010 therefore we applied spei 3 as the in situ index and the variables related to crop growth were used to calculate mdsi by a constrained optimization method spi 3 was used to verify the sensitivity of mdsi to precipitation 3 2 modified drought severity index mdsi there are 8 widely used dis i e avi vci vswi tci cwsi tvdi dsi and vhi which can be categorized into three groups 1 drought indices considering vegetation growth such as avi vci vswi tci tvdi and vhi 2 drought index considering crop water stress only such as cwsi and 3 drought indices considering vegetation growth and sm such as dsi dsi combines ndvi et and pet where ndvi describes vegetation growth changes the ratio of et to pet better reflects the energy and water exchange among vegetation soil and atmosphere and can describe crop water stress allen et al 2011 cooke et al 2012 park et al 2016 huang et al 2018 more detailed descriptions can be found in table 1 jackson et al 1981 1988 chen et al 1994 carlson et al 1994 kogan 1995b sandholt et al 2002 kogan 2012 mu et al 2013 the algorithm of mdsi is as follows the first step is to calculate the index reflecting the greenness vci temperature tci vegetation structure and physiological parameters lap of the vegetation canopy 1 vci ndvi i ndvi min ndvi max ndvi min 2 tci lst max lst i lst max lst min 3 lap lai i lai lai while ndvi is the normalized difference vegetation index lst is the surface temperature lai is the leaf area index i is the value of the variable during the ith period within a certain year max is the maximum value of the variable in the ith period within a certain year min is the minimum value of the variable in the ith period within a certain year is the multi year average value of the variable during the ith period within a certain year the second step is to standardize vci tci lap and et pet 4 z index index i index σ index where index i is the value of the variable during the ith period of within a certain year σ index is the standard deviation of index and index is the multi year average of the index variable during the ith period within a certain year z index is vci tci lap and et pet standardized by the z score z vci denotes the greenness of the vegetation canopy the larger the z vci value the better the vegetation growth condition z tci describes the temperature of the vegetation canopy the larger the z tci value the weaker the effect of temperature stress on vegetation growth z lap indicates the structure and physiological parameters of vegetation the larger the z lap value the stronger the photosynthesis of vegetation z et pet expresses crop water stress information such that the larger the z et pet value the weaker the vegetation under water stress taking spei 3 as the in situ index we summed up z vci z tci z lap and z et pet based on the optimal weight from the constrained optimization method and then we obtained the mdsi as 5 f x y m a x e x μ x y μ y σ x σ y x s p e i 3 7 o α z vci β z tci γ z lap 1 α β γ z et pet 8 0 α 1 0 β 1 0 γ 1 9 mdsi o i o σ o while f x y is the highest correlation between x and y y is the comprehensive standard score derived from z vci z tci z lap and z et pet x is the in situ index spei 3 σ y is the standard deviation of y y i is value of the variable during the ith period within a certain year y is the multi year average value of the y variable during the ith period within a certain year mdsi is a modified version of dsi positive mdsi shows wet conditions and higher mdsi shows wetter conditions and vice versa however one issue about the constrained optimization method is regionally varying weights irrespective of regional differences across the underlying surface therefore based on the pixel scale and in situ drought index this study calculated the optimal weights of different agricultural drought related variables to improve the regional applicability of constrained optimization method both mdsi and dsi are defined by the z score the mdsi proposed in this study follows the normal distribution average value is 0 standard deviation is 1 since they have the same drought and humidity monitoring results the same drought and humidity classification standards can be used zhang and yamaguchi 2014 table 2 3 3 t test of the correlation coefficient the correlation coefficient is a statistical indicator showing the degree of correlation between two variables in this study we used the correlation coefficient to quantify the correlation between dis and sm and between spi 3 and ada at the pixel scale the significance of the correlation coefficient was evaluated using the t test 3 4 sen s slope and modified mann kendall trend test sen s slope is a robust non parametric statistical method for the detection of trends and is widely used for meteorological hydrological and vegetation data theil 1992 the modified mann kendall test mmk hamed and rao 1998 daufresne et al 2009 zhang et al 2012 was employed and more detailed algorithm of the mmk can be referred to daufresne et al 2009 based on the mmk altman and bland 2011 and sen s slope trends of mdsi were evaluated and subdivided into seven grades table 3 3 5 hurst exponent the persistency of mdsi across china was evaluated using the hurst exponent hurst 1951 based on the rescaled range r s analysis method with respect to long range correlation the hurst exponent ranges from 0 to 1 with h 0 5 indicating random nature and h 0 5 persistent tendency of the current changes the greater the h value the stronger the persistency of the time series 0 h 0 5 indicates that the future changes are opposite of the past i e the anti persistency the smaller the h value the stronger the anti persistency hurst 1951 according to the hurst exponent and sen s slope the persistency of mdsi was divided into five grades table 4 fig 2 demonstrates the entire analysis procedure of the current study 4 results 4 1 applicability of mdsi in drought monitoring across china 4 1 1 remote sensing dis vs sm relations we evaluated applicability of 9 drought indices in drought monitoring across china fig s1 and found that dis considering et and pet such as cwsi dsi and mdsi had higher correlation coefficients with sm than other dis mdsi had higher correlation coefficients with sm than did other dis all dis monitored sm changes in the southwest of slrb the yrb and the northeast of irb refer to fig 1d for the location of major river basins while mdsi described sm changes better than other dis at a larger spatial scale it was also found that relatively poor drought monitoring by dis in the south of the yzrb and mdsi had high correlation with sm furthermore comparison between cwsi dsi and mdsi indicated that significant correlation between mdsi 97 92 and sm was much higher than that between cwsi 46 36 and dsi 46 04 in the vegetation coverage area across china fig 3 correlations between dis and sm for specific river basins across china fig s2 indicated better monitoring performance of mdsi within 9 major river basins t test 2 12 p 0 05 except mdsi the other dis poorly monitored sm changes over the hrb prb swrb and serb t test value 2 12 p 0 05 for areas with different vegetation types fig s3 mdsi monitored well the sm of regions with all vegetation types t test 2 12 p 0 05 and especially the sm of the grassland crops and forest t test value 2 92 p 0 01 thus it was evident that mdsi compared to other dis had monitored sm changes well across china and deemed to be the right choice for drought monitoring practice 4 1 2 remote sensing dis vs spi 3 relations we quantified relations between dis and spi 3 and the significance of correlation was evaluated using the t test method fig s4 it was found that dis considering ndvi such as avi vci and vswi had lower correlation coefficients with spi 3 than had other dis the correlation between dis and spi 3 was similar to sm mdsi had shown advantages over other dis in terms of its relation with spi 3 in most phases expected in autumn and growing seasons the spatial pattern of relations between 9 dis and spi 3 during the growing season fig 4 showed that mdsi did better in describing spi 3 changes than other dis across china it is worth noting that mdsi can also effectively monitor drought changes in areas with sparse meteorological observation sites overcoming the spatial discontinuity of meteorological drought monitoring based on spi 3 such as the qinghai tibet plateau and north china similar to agricultural drought monitoring mdsi had relatively satisfactorily monitored meteorological drought in the south of the yzrb dsi vhi and mdsi better reflected the impact of precipitation deficit on agricultural drought compared with other dis significantly related stations between mdsi 68 32 and spi 3 were much higher than those of dsi 32 35 and vhi 29 74 for selected 1957 meteorological stations across china fig 3 for monitoring performance of dis in different river basins fig s5 mdsi adequately monitored spi 3 changes in 7 major river basins t test value 2 12 p 0 05 except prb and swrb however the meteorological drought monitored by other dis was more frustrating than mdsi in the prb and swrb for monitoring meteorological drought in regions with different vegetation types fig s6 mdsi monitored the meteorological drought of regions with all vegetation types t test 2 12 p 0 05 especially the meteorological drought of the grassland crops and forest t test value 2 92 p 0 01 thus mdsi had a more widespread and reliable applicability in monitoring meteorological drought across china 4 1 3 time lag responses of mdsi and other dis to spi 3 we analyzed correlation between dis and cumulative precipitation at time lags of 0 12 months wang et al 2003 the month of maximum correlation coefficient between drought index of the growing season scale and average spi 3 in the first 12 months is the lag time fig 5 shows the spatial heterogeneity of lag time in response of dis to spi 3 change we found a considerable lag time in response of agricultural drought to the spi 3 change comparison of lag times in response of dis to the spi 3 change indicated that dis considering vegetation greenness and canopy temperature tvdi vhi and mdsi usually had a shorter lag time than other dis particularly in yzrb hurb and prb the dis which takes into account crop water stress or vegetation greenness avi vci vswi cwsi and dsi had a longer lag time in their response to the spi 3 change especially in the yrb analysis showed that dis considering onefold factors usually had longer lag time in response to dis to spi 3 change however the lag time of mdsi 58 25 and spi 3 was 3 months which was higher than tvdi 53 45 and vhi 47 32 for selected 1957 meteorological stations across china fig 5 indicating that mdsi captured well the agrometeorological drought it can be seen from fig 4 and fig 6 that the correlation between dis and spi 3 during the growing season increased significantly given the consideration of lag time while the spatial pattern of correlation was similar before and after the consideration of lag time given the consideration of lag time the correlation between spi 3 and mdsi was still the highest when compared to other dis indicating that mdsi better monitored agricultural drought from the viewpoint of meteorological droughts for correlation between dis and spi 3 for different river basins figs s5 s7 and for regions with different vegetation types figs s6 s8 different correlations between drought indices and precipitation were observed the correlation between dis and spi 3 in the yrb slrb and irb increased greatly which indicated that the lack of precipitation in these basins had a greater impact on the development of agricultural economy the correlation between dis and spi 3 in hurb and harb was remote which indicated that the occurrence of agricultural drought in these basins was greatly affected by the precipitation in the same period from the viewpoint of vegetation types before and after considering lag time figs s6 s8 impacts on correlations between dis and spi 3 were small indicating that the lag time in response of agricultural drought to precipitation was heavily influenced by the location but not mainly by vegetation type considering the impact of irrigation on agriculture yu et al 2019 we computed maximum correlation coefficients between dis and spi 3 for different irrigation areas it can be seen from fig s9 that for different irrigation areas the maximum correlation coefficients of agricultural drought response to meteorological drought followed the following order i e irrigated single crop rainfed crop irrigated double crop irrigated triple crop comparison of the t test values of the correlation coefficients between mdsi and other dis and spi 3 in different irrigation areas after considering the lag time showed that lower drought monitoring performance was observed for drought monitoring indices given irrigated single crop even so mdsi still showed an advantage over drought indices in monitoring agricultural droughts in different agricultural areas 4 1 4 correlation between dis and drought affected areas previous studies mostly focused on the verification of remote sensing drought indices using sm precipitation or meteorological drought indices sun et al 2017 zhang et al 2018c jiao et al 2019 yu et al 2019 li et al 2020 correlation coefficients were computed between the drought affected area of each province from the national bureau of statistics and the average of the nine annual scale dis fig 7 it can be seen from fig 7 that except for tci and tvdi drought indices considered in this study successfully monitored agricultural drought affected area over 50 of the provinces in china while mdsi monitored well agriculture drought affected areas in all the provinces in addition dsi vhi and mdsi monitored the total drought affected area over 40 of the provinces while mdsi monitored well the total drought affected area over 50 of the provinces results indicated that mdsi considering greenness and temperature of the vegetation canopy structure and physiological parameters of vegetation and water shortage degree of crops better captured crop yields and was of considerable applicability for agricultural drought monitoring 4 2 spatiotemporal pattern of mdsi droughts across china during 2001 to 2018 4 2 1 temporal changes of annual droughts across china we analyzed drought changes across china using the mdsi variation within nine river basins and related cumulative anomalies of mdsi it can be seen from fig 8 that an extremely significant wetting tendency was observed in yzrb yrb prb and slrb with a long term trend 0 25 10a meanwhile a significant wetting tendency was found in the serb with long term trends of 0 27 10a insignificant wetting tendency was identified in hurb harb and swrb the cumulative anomalies of mdsi decreased and then increased in the yzrb the yrb the prb the slrb and the serb specifically cumulative anomalies of mdsi reached the trough value in 2009 in the yrb the slrb the irb and the serb indicating that 2009 was the time point for transition from drying to wetting conditions for these basins similarly the transition from drying to wetting conditions in the yzrb and prb occurred in 2013 4 2 2 trends of droughts across china according to table 3 the change trend of mdsi was divided and the results are shown in fig 9 at the monthly scale a slight drying trend was found in the xilin gol grassland in march and the drying tendency may have a serious impact on the greening of grass the periods of january to march and july to august witnessed intensifying droughts over the hurb particularly for the period from july to august while the period of july to august was the critical period for summer maize and rice the period from november to february of the following year witnessed a drying tendency in the hinterland of the qinghai tibet plateau a remarkable wetting tendency was found during may to september over middle and upper reaches of the yrb the period from september to january witnessed a considerable wetting tendency in regions south to the yzrb the spatial pattern of trends in seasonal droughts was similar to that of monthly droughts drought trends during the growing season and at the annual scale were consistent in spatial pattern with the trends of autumn droughts implying a larger contribution of autumn trends to trends of droughts at the annual scale during the growing season changes in the underlying surface have an impact on the changing trend of regional drought we set up four scenarios and control scenarios unchanged area according to the spatial distribution of the transformed land use pattern fig 1b then calculated the average of trends in monthly droughts for five scenarios fig 10 the trend values of mdsi in the yrb the hurb and the harb were significantly higher than those in the unchanged area showing that ecological restoration helped mitigate droughts fig 10 nevertheless the trend of mdsi in the irb was significantly lower than that in the regions with unchanged area since the irb is mostly the pastoral area and overgrazing leads to further deterioration of the ecological environment qiu et al 2020 for drought trends influenced by urbanization in the yzrb the yrb the harb the prb the serb mdsi over the urbanized regions was lower than that over the regions with unchanged area this result indicates that urbanization can potentially intensify droughts for the cultivated land reclamation area in the yrb and irb the increased irrigation consumption can help mitigate agricultural droughts in the regions with grassland degraded grasslands are found mainly in the irb fig 2b d and the intensified drought in turn will enhance grassland degradation and reduce grassland productivity mainly in the xilin gol grasslands in march and in the qinghai tibetan plateau from november to february 4 2 3 persistency of droughts across china according to table 3 the change trend of mdsi was divided and the results are shown in fig 11 it can be seen from fig 11 that general anti persistency of droughts was observed across china indicating that the tendency of drought in the near future was opposite to that in the past at the monthly scale in the near future most areas of the xilin gol grassland was dominated by a drying tendency from june to february meanwhile the periods of july witnessed a drying tendency in the paddy areas of the hurb and future drought would potentially be intensified the periods of may to september witnessed intensified droughts in the slrb and the yrb in the near future in addition the seasonal and monthly drought trends had a strong similarity in the spatial distribution while the spatial pattern of persistency of drought during the growing season and that at the annual scale was more consistent with that of summer drought therefore the persistency of summer drought contributed the most to the persistency of droughts during the growing season and that at the annual scale fig 11 we also analyzed the hurst exponents of msdi over five scenarios from 2000 to 2018 showing the impacts of land use changes on drought persistency fig 1b it can be seen from fig 12 that the average value of the hurst exponent of the nine major river basins in china ranged from 0 40 to 0 50 and droughts within these 9 major river basins generally had weak anti persistency the degraded grassland enhanced anti persistency of drought mainly referring to irb droughts over the regions with urban expansion areas and cultivated land reclamation areas were subject to weakened anti persistency to a certain extent from the hurst variation range under the five scenarios indicating that changes in the underlying features of the yzrb the irb and the swrb remarkably modified the persistency of drought 5 discussion our overall goal was to enhance the accuracy of drought monitoring by developing an mdsi that can be applied across countries with large areas and it was suitable for areas with sparse stations a tremendous amount of studies has reached a consensus that constructing drought indices based on univariate or bivariate is likely to be insufficient for accurate drought monitoring huang et al 2015 chen et al 2020 in addition how to effectively integrate different drought related variables is the key to construct comprehensive drought index however previous works mostly used fixed weights to blend different drought related variables rhee et al 2010 hao et al 2015 sun et al 2017 which ignored the impact of regional differences on weights in this study mdsi was developed based on the constrained optimization method to calculate the assigned weights for inputs at multi temporal scales to reflect the agricultural drought information and verified its applicability at the national level figs 3 4 7 in general ndvi based dis poorly monitored droughts in southern china where forests and crops were dominant with abundant precipitation and strong vegetation transpiration li et al 2017a li et al 2017b however ndvi constructed by the visible light and near infrared monitored the health of vegetation through chlorophyll content but could not provide timely information about energy and water exchange among vegetation soil and atmosphere olsen et al 2015 in addition previous works have confirmed that there is a strong linear relationship between ndvi and lai fensholt et al 2004 qiao et al 2019 but some studies show that the impact of climate change on ndvi and lai has a certain degree of difference myneni et al 2007 lee et al 2013 and there is the spatial heterogeneity in the impact of lai change on terrestrial water storage in china tao et al 2020 given the limitation of dsi when used for drought monitoring at a large scale with complex underlying surface mdsi combines multiple vegetation growth limiting factors thereby leading to the best performance among dis xu et al 2018 found that the response of vegetation index to long term drought was mainly in northeast china and yrb which is similar to our results as shown in fig 5 the main reason is that afforestation caused high water holding capacity of the soil and short term increase or decrease of precipitation could not trigger significant sm changes in yrb while the northeastern and southern coastal areas of the slrb are dominated by woodlands and shrubs higher vegetation coverage and relative stable ecological environment caused lower responses of dis to precipitation changes he et al 2017b however the lag response of dis for a long time to meteorological drought makes it difficult to assess the impact of insufficient precipitation on vegetation while mdsi has greatly improved in this aspect some researchers have focused on the spatial temporal distribution of drought in china based on the meteorological station data or remote sensing drought index using the palmer drought severity index yan et al 2016 found that an extreme drought event occurred in 2001 and relatively severe droughts occurred in north china which is similar to our results shown in fig 8 the main reason is that the strong la niña phenomenon occurred in 2000 2001 which led to the abundant precipitation in the south and the dry precipitation in the north li et al 2019 in addition based on the integrated surface drought index isdi and modified temperature vegetation drought index mtvdi zhou et al 2017 and zhao et al 2017 found that drought in northeast china and the south of the yzrb showed an obvious decreasing trend in different periods zhu et al 2019 showed that the sm of farmland increased fastest in summer and autumn many studies above have focused on the temporal spatial pattern of drought across the china while there is comparability in the temporal spatial pattern of drought across the china between this study and previous studies the results of the study demonstrated that ecological restoration helped mitigate droughts in huang huai hai plain and a remarkable wetting tendency was found during may to september in the middle and upper reaches of the yrb ye et al 2019b confirmed that ecological restoration has a negative impact on sm in humid and semi humid areas while it has a positive impact on sm in arid and semi arid areas under the influence of china s widespread greening summer precipitation increased in the huang huai hai plain yu et al 2020 however some studies also showed that ecological restoration reduced sm feng et al 2017 li et al 2018b these results suggest that if vegetation greening leads to reduced sm mdsi can overestimate the increase of soil wetness in response to ecological restoration across china in addition urbanized areas have a potentially negative effect on drought mitigation these areas are urbanizing rapidly and the rate of urban expansion exceeds the capacity of the ecological environment leading to the contradiction between people and land liao et al 2020 our study made an improvement of drought severity index dsi and the results could provide references for the development of agricultural drought in china and china s food security in this study the relationship between in situ drought index spei 3 and several factors limiting vegetation growth was considered compared with the application of spei 3 limited to regions with available meteorological ground observations establishing reliable integrated remote sensing based agricultural drought related variables which could be applied in various environmental regions without relying on ground observations was an important avenue for future work ayantobo et al 2017 liu et al 2019 jiao et al 2019 also in situ observations of meteorological variables cannot completely reflect areal drought characteristics sun et al 2017 in addition mdsi has higher spatial resolution than reanalysis data allowing for high spatial resolution agricultural and meteorological drought monitoring however the accuracy of drought monitoring is still affected by terrain snow cover soil water holding capacity and human activities which is also the main reason for the unsatisfactory monitoring in a few areas in addition the hurst exponent is also used to study the persistency of drought but the prediction of future drought has great uncertainty in further studies we will consider the influence of other factors on the accuracy of drought monitoring and try to use a variety of methods to evaluate the future trend of drought 6 conclusion in this study mdsi with vegetation greenness crop water shortage canopy temperature vegetation structure and physiological status as input variables was constructed we compared di and mdsi with sm precipitation and drought affected area in order to evaluate drought monitoring by evidencing the applicability of mdsi in drought monitoring across china based on mdsi we analyzed droughts across china in both space and time the main conclusions can be drawn as follows 1 mdsi described sm changes at a larger spatial scale better than other dis especially in south of the yzrb it has been significantly improved at most time scales mdsi had a higher correlation coefficient with sm spi 3 than other dis and had highest correlation in agricultural regions indicating that mdsi had remarkable advantages over dis in monitoring agricultural droughts besides mdsi can monitor well drought affected areas further corroborating the applicability of mdsi in agricultural drought monitoring across china 2 the nine major river basins in china showed a wetting tendency during 2001 2018 especially in the yzrb yrb prb and slrb xilin gol grasslands underwent a drying tendency in march a wetting tendency can be found mainly in the regions south of the yzrb during september to january droughts across most regions of china are subject to anti persistency showing a drought tendency in the near future may be opposite of the past 3 the relationship between drought trends and changes in the underlying surface showed that grassland degradation in irb intensified drought and enhanced anti persistency of drought the ecological restoration in the huang huai hai plain decreased drought risks rapid urbanization can potentially intensify droughts while the cultivated land reclamation areas of the yrb and irb have promoted drought alleviation 4 degraded grassland enhanced anti persistency of drought mainly refer to irb droughts over the regions with urban expansion areas and cultivated land reclamation areas were subject to weakened anti persistency from the hurst variation range under the five scenarios drought persistency of the yzrb the irb and the swrb is most affected by the change of underlying features credit authorship
