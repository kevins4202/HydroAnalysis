particulate solids ps based on the combination of crystallization properties of fog and density based separation due to stirring three different process parameters such as water temperature rate of stirring time period of stirring were optimized to enhance the crystallization of fog leading to its separation from the wastewater and ps this concept was applied to an agro industrial coconut industry ci wastewater containing agglomerates of fog and ps at concentrations of 2 50 g l and 3 90 g l respectively an optimum temperature of 17 c stirring speed of 1440 rpm for 10 min extricated 85

of coconut oil and coconut kernel particles respectively the longer holding of wastewater generates foul odor due to microbial decomposition whereas the aggregated afp at the interface turns rancid e g the conversion of saturated to unsaturated fatty acids due to exposure with air and sunlight the afp is manually scooped followed by its boiling at 80 100 c to simultaneously liquefy the fog and separate it from the settled ps the conventional process is laborious recovers merely 50 60 of the total fog from the wastewater moreover the thermal recovery process enhances the rancidification of fog simultaneously destroying the comestible properties and commercial values of both fog and ps to overcome the aforementioned difficulties this study aimed to exploit the crystallization property of fog to ensure its faster and efficient separation from wastewater and ps fog is polymorphic in nature hence undergoes a transformation from a liquid state to a crystalline state governed by various factors such as seeding shear pressure temperature presence of solvents critical rate of cooling critical crystallization temperature tc etc 8 10 the process of crystallization happens through a series of intermediary steps such as nucleation agglomeration and solidification 11 the crystallization of fog is accelerated at specific tc which is unique to the structure of tag and fatty acids

crystallization properties of fog is widely explored in food industries to separate fats and lipids fractionate the tag and high melting fats 9 the research focused on optimizing the process of crystallization through the simultaneous manipulation of temperature and stirring to effectively separate the fog this novel concept was tested on the raw wastewater discharged by the food and oil processing industry e g ci 2 materials and methods the wastewater discharged by ci contains 2 50 g l fog and 3 90 g l ps the physicochemical properties of ci wastewater have been described in our previous study 13 the temperature of ci wastewater varies between 25 40 c the ci wastewater was collected in bulk quantities from the holding tank 5 10 m3 at m s mahaveer desiccated coconut industries karnataka india transferred to the laboratory and stored at 15 c voltas deep freezer for further analysis the samples were thawed to room temperature for analysis the ci wastewater was cooled from room temperature to the desired temperatures ranging between 8 23 c in the deep freezer voltas deep freezer the temperature of wastewater was measured manually using standard glass mercury thermometer after attaining the respective temperature approximately 1 l of the sample was transferred to a wide mouth beaker followed by its stirring with help of an overhead mechanical stirrer subsequently transferred into a 1 l standard measuring cylinder for phase separation and settling the mechanical stirrer was procured from shree veer products india rated at 125 watt 1440 rpm rotor speed the stirring time was varied between 0 24 min the stirrer was similar to the commonly available kitchen butter stirrer churner the stirring was not performed under thermostatic conditions which led to an increase in the temperature of wastewater by 2 3 c therefore the heat gain was compensated by cooling the wastewater sample to 2 3 c below the desired temperatures subsequent to stirring the mixture was allowed to settle leading to the formation of three distinct layers the top one being the floating fog bottom layer contains settled ps and the middle layer is made up of wastewater devoid of ps and fog fig 1 the accumulated mass fog ps at the surface of the measuring cylinder was manually scooped and subsequently dried in a hot air oven 103 105 c for 6 8 h and quantified gravimetrically as per the standard methods for total solids ts analysis apha 2006 the obtained values represented the dry weight of total floating mass fog ps subsequently fog was fractionated from the dried mixture of fog ps by hexane extraction method and quantified gravimetrically as per the standard methods apha 2006 the extracted fog was termed as floating fog whereas the residual solids were termed as floating ps the settled ps was the ps collected at the bottom of the measuring cylinder after 6 h of settling time the settling velocity of the solids was estimated as per the standard methods apha 2006 3 results and discussion the freshly collected malodorous wastewater discharged by ci was subjected to the aforementioned method of phase separation the optimum temperature necessary for efficient fractionation of fog agglomerates were estimated by cooling the ci wastewater to a narrow range of temperatures ranging between 10 23 c the experiments were conducted between 10 23 c because the tc of coconut oil has been reported to be 29 c 10 the optimum separation of phases was obtained at 17 c and stirring rates of 1440 rpm for 10 min fig 2 resulting in a relatively higher fog content 85 and lower floating ps 16 in the overall floating mass at room temperature 24 26 c a floating mass was commonly observed however it consisted of both floating ps 38 and fog 61 this was mainly attributed to the fact that room temperature was below the tc of fog similarly at temperatures below 15 c the floating ps 33 36 remained as an agglomerate with fog 63 66 at the surface despite the stirring that can be attributed to the formation of a dense solid mass ps and entrapment of ps within fog an increase in stirring time up to 21 min and the rate of stirring to 1600 rpm had no significant impact on the phase separation or settling velocity of ps figs 4 5 and data not shown moreover either of the steps i e cooling or stirring when executed individually did not yield the separation of phases indicating the importance of both the steps i e cooling followed by stirring fig 1 relatively faster fractionation and recovery of fog from the ci wastewater reduces its propensity of rancidification and preserves its sensory qualities moreover the wastewater devoid of ps could be immediately subjected to biological treatment before the onset of microbial fermentation conventional methods of holding the ci wastewater in open tanks for 5 15 days would initiate microbial fermentation of sugars to volatile fatty acids vfa leading to ph 5 hence downstream microbial treatment would further require ph neutralization to 7 5 by the addition of alkali the proposed process thus simplifies the downstream treatment by avoiding the aforementioned difficulties the wastewater was precooled to the desired temperature followed by stirring leading to the separation of ps and fog from the wastewater in a relatively short period of time subsequent to stirring the mixture was allowed to settle leading to the formation of three distinct layers the top one being the floating fog bottom layer contains settled ps and the middle layer is made up of wastewater devoid of ps and fog fig 1 the proposed physical process of cooling and stirring is hypothesized to perform multiple activities simultaneously such as i breaking of fog and water emulsion ii coalescences of the fog particles to form a solid mass at the surface iii breaking of fog and ps agglomerates leading to the separation of more than 85 of the ps from the fog iv phase separation based on the density of individual components i e density of fog wastewater ps the formation of crystalline fog agglomerates is weakly miscible in water and tends to accumulate at the surface of water due to its relatively lower density hence the formation of crystalline agglomerates at the surface of water leads to its floatation that can be scooped from the surface easily on the other hand ps that were earlier adhered to fog undergoes separation and settling at a velocity of 12 cm hr figs 3 and 4 the proposed process relies on the crystallization behavior of fog which is governed by its chemical composition hence the pre determination of unknown fogs chemical composition will aid in discerning the tc temperature the recovery of oil and pollutants from wastewater through the manipulation of crystallization properties have been relatively contemporary feng et al 14 recovered 95 oil from the cutting fluid wastewater through sequential freezing at 8 c and mixing at 300 rpm multiple freeze thaw processes at sub zero and room temperatures led to the recovery of 11 5 g organic and inorganic pollutants from industrial wastewater 15 in practice the aforementioned method of fractionation is scalable and economically feasible the pre cooling of ci wastewater to 17 c can be performed in a batch mixing tank or through an online cooling of the wastewater discharge tubes followed by mechanical agitation at 1440 rpm at the designated time of 10 min respectively thereafter the processed wastewater has to be held in vats tanks to ensure effective phase separation the higher commercial value of coconut lipids at us 3 kg or 200 kg and ps at us 0 15 10 kg contemplates making this process economically viable assuming a ci discharging 50m3 of wastewater per day constituting a nominal amount of 2 g l lipids and 3 g l ps with a recovery efficiency of 80 by the above process is expected to yield a daily return of us 240 16 000 from lipids and us 18 1200 from ps moreover the recovery of lipids and ps would enhance the efficiency of biological treatment e g anaerobic aerobic by simultaneously reducing the overall organic loads and hydraulic retention time 4 conclusion this research demonstrates a novel process for a relatively faster separation of fog and ps from the wastewater the crystallization process of fog was accelerated through simultaneous cooling of ci wastewater to 17 c and stirring at 1440 rpm for 10 min this process led to the formation of three distinct layers the top layer of fog free from 85 ps a middle layer of wastewater the bottom layer of ps the crystalline fog agglomerates could be easily scooped from the surface of wastewater followed by decantation or pumping of wastewater into the bioreactors without any remnants of ps and fog this process minimizes the exposure time of fog and wastewater with air hence reducing the propensity for rancidification or fermentation of wastewater respectively this process has the potential for wide scale application in fog rich wastewater treatment plants across the globe declarations of competing interest none acknowledgments the authors acknowledge the financial assistance provided by the karnataka state pollution

14101,sodium dodecyl benzenesulfonate sdbs is a common anionic surfactant used in detergents and a major household pollutant sdbs released with bathing and laundry wastewater causes eutrophication of water bodies and toxicity in aquatic organisms we compared the degradation of sdbs in aqueous solution by vacuum ultraviolet vuv 254 nm and 185 nm and ultraviolet irradiation uv 254 nm using lab scale reactors vuv degraded sdbs more efficiently than uv also achieving a higher mineralization rate ho was the main reactive oxygen species produced by vuv sdbs concentration affected the distribution of absorbed vuv and uv photons and influenced the reaction triggered vuv was more efficient at lower concentrations when indirect oxidation by ho was prevalent the uv process relied mostly on direct photolysis and was affected slightly by initial concentration vuv was more efficient at solution ph of 5 and 9 while uv performed better at alkaline conditions temperature increased the degradation rates for both processes the addition of so4 2 slightly promoted sdbs degradation in the vuv process while cl and hco3 inhibited it for uv so4 2 and cl illustrated no significant difference on the degradation while hco3 had a positive impact on the system we identified the four photoproducts of sdbs degradation by vuv and proposed a degradation pathway finally the fact the vuv could be efficiently used to remove anionic surfactant from real wastewater proved that it can be applied efficiently with low energetic consumption keywords sdbs vacuum ultraviolet vuv ultraviolet uv bathing and laundry wastewater 1 introduction surfactants are widely employed in household cleaning detergents personal care products and in the industrial medical and biological fields they are one of the main household pollutants released with wastewater 1 5 the most common surfactants in detergents are anionic linear alkylbenzene sulfonates las 6 7 extensive use of las including the pervasive sodium dodecyl benzenesulfonate sdbs has serious environmental consequences through eutrophication of water bodies and toxic effects to aquatic organisms 8 9 various water treatment technologies including biological degradation coagulation advanced oxidation process aop membrane filtration and their combinations have been applied to las removal with variable results while an activated sludge process could remove 95 99 of las from sewage 10 11 the process was disturbed around 50 mg l las and even inhibited at higher concentrations 9 coagulation flocculation by fecl3 could efficiently remove 99 high surfactant concentrations from industrial wastewater but required large amounts of coagulant 12 polyethersulphone or polysulphone membrane filtration has also been used to remove surfactants but only retained 32 78 depending on the concentration 13 recently aops have been developed as part of water or wastewater treatment process they deployed potent oxidants including cl2 clo2 kmno4 o3 o3 h2o2 and o3 activated carbon oxidizing irradiation e g uv ultrasound and electron beam and plasma treatments 14 19 interestingly previous reports indicated that sdbs has a high reactivity with ho formed during o3 h2o2 process but slow reactivity with cl2 clo2 kmno4 and o3 18 this indicates that ho could be one of the most effective species for surfactant degradation recently vacuum ultraviolet vuv has gained great attention as an efficient and environmentally friendly method to produce ho during water or wastewater purification 20 vuv has wavelengths of 100 200 nm and is photo chemically active 21 185 nm photons are strongly absorbed by water molecules coefficient of 1 8 cm 1 causing the hemolysis and ionization of water molecules powerfully oxidizing hydroxyl radicals ho and h are then produced through eqs 1 and 2 22 23 the vuv process is more efficient than most uv based aops for degrading organic contaminants and inorganic ions and does not require additional oxidizing chemicals 24 it has been successfully applied to degrade multiple organic pollutant e g algal organic matter pesticides antibiotics phenolic compound in aqueous solution 25 30 high degradation rate 90 of five typical pesticides aldicarb alachlor chloroneb methiocarb and atrazine were achieved under vuv fluence of 12 mj cm 2 27 vuv was technically efficient for degradation of cloxacillin antibiotic and the addition of fe2 was more energy effective 28 vuv photo fenton process significantly enhanced the degradation and mineralization of sulfamethazine 29 all these studies have demonstrated the potential of vuv process for the water containing organic contaminants since sdbs can be efficiently removed by hydroxyl radicals an obvious removal effect can be expected under vuv irradiation 1 h2o hv185nm ho h ф1 0 33 2 h2o hv185nm h eaq ho ф2 0 045 bathing and laundry wastewater reuse has been limited by the lack of effective purification methods for example biodegradation requires long incubation cycles and adsorption has low recycling rates moreover uv based aops require the addition of oxidizing agents to the wastewater pipes which can be challenging and lead to toxicity of the treated solution hence the vuv process poses as a sustainable and oxidant free method to remove surfactant and other micro pollutants from wastewater allowing its reuse 31 despite the efforts to develop processes for surfactant removal the mechanisms of vuv and uv photo induced sdbs degradation have not been investigated before the aim of this paper was to investigate the mechanisms involved in sdbs oxidation by vuv and uv and identify the role of reactive species in each process we also analyzed the effects of different parameters in the systems including initial sdbs concentration ph temperature and presence of inorganic anions the pathway of sdbs degradation by vuv was also proposed finally the vuv and uv processwas seperately applied to real bathing and laundry wastewater to evaluate its practicability the results of this work offer a better understanding of the reaction mechanisms and outcomes of vuv which can be applied to the degradation of various organic micro pollutants 2 materials and method 2 1 chemicals all chemicals used were of analytical grade or higher and were used without further purification sdbs ar grade mixture seen in fig s1 sodium salts nacl na2so4 and nahco3 tert butyl alcohol tba and formic acid fa ar grade 88 were all supplied by aladdin shanghai china stock solutions were prepared with ultra pure water generated by a milli q heal

china the samples were stored in a refrigerator at 4 2 2 experimental procedures photochemical experiments were performed in a sealed cylindrical borosilicate glass reactor with approximately 700 ml in volume the reactor was covered with a 6 mm layer of thick pvc to prevent ultraviolet leakage vuv gph150t5vh 4 heraeus co or uv gph150t5l 4 heraeus co 6 w low pressure mercury lamps were placed in the reactor protected by a quartz tube and at 1 cm from its surface fig s2 the vuv lamp emitted radiation both at 254 nm 90 and 185 nm 10 according to 1 9 28 with the light intensities of 0 064 mw cm2 and 0 006 mw cm2 respectively the uv lamp emitted at 254 nm with an intensity of 0 069 mw cm2 light intensities were measured with a digital light power meter cel np2000 2 to reach a stable light output the lamps were turned on at least 20 min prior to the photochemical experiments the ph of the sdbs solution was adjusted to 3 5 7 9 or 11 with 0 1 mol l hcl or 0 1 mol l naoh the temperature was controlled in a water bath equipped with a thermostat and ranged from 273 k to 303 k the effects of inorganic anions so4 2 cl and hco3 on sdbs degradation was investigated at 0 1 and 2 mm all results reported are average values of triplicate experiments 2 3 analytical methods the ph was determined with a thermo ph meter shanghai china calibrated daily using ph buffer solutions total organic carbon toc was measured by a vario toc cube analyzer elementar germany we monitored the time course of benzene ring cleavage by the benzene ring spectral band positioned at 224 nm using uv vis 32 sdbs concentration was determined in a uv vis detector uv2600 china at 223 nm 33 anionic surfactants were measured in real bathing and laundry wastewater samples as methylene blue active substances using standard methods 34 chemical oxygen demand codcr was determined as described before 35 intermediates during sdbs degradation were identified with an agilent 1290 infinity 6460 lc qqq ms equipped with an electrospray ionization esi source and operated in the negative esi electrospray ionization mode the spray voltage was 3 5 kv and capillary temperature was 300 c the mobile phase was a mixture of methanol and ultrapure water 0 1 formic acid at a flow rate of 0 2 ml min 1 the elution process was 0 4 min 25 5 methanol 4 5 min 5 25 methanol and 5 8 min 25 methanol inorganic anions were analyzed at 25 in a chromatographer metrohm 883 basic ic plus and equipped with a metrosep a supp 250 0 mm 4 0 mm column the eluent used was a 3 2 mmol l na2co3 and 0 1 mmol l nahco3 solution flow was 0 700 ml min and the sample volume was 20 u l the epr spectra were recorded in duplicate or triplicate on a electron spin resonance spectrometer jeol jes fa200 at room temperature ca 25 dmpo solutions were mixed vigorously in the presence of vuv or uv irradiation and then loaded into a capillary tube 0 5 mm 10 cm the kinetics of sdbs degradation were fitted based on a pseudo first order kinetic model 18 where c0 mg l is the initial concentration of sdbs mg l ct is the concentration at time t min and k min 1 is the pseudo first order rate constant eq 3 3 ln ct c0 kt 3 results and discussion 3 1 sdbs degradation by the vuv and uv processes fig 1 shows the degradation of sdbs by the vuv and uv processes over a 120 min period overall vuv was more efficient than uv under the same conditions within 60 min of the treatment 91 of sdbs had been degraded by vuv while uv only achieved 67 at the final time point data for both treatments could be fitted with high linearity r2 0 999 with eq 3 indicating that they follow pseudo first order kinetics the sdbs degradation rate for vuv kvuv and uv kuv was 0 0400 and 0 0104 min 1 respectively next we investigated the mechanisms of sdbs degradation by vuv and uv while the uv process should rely almost exclusively on direct photolysis by λ 254 nm 29 vuv may act by direct photolysis by λ 185 nm and λ 254 nm and or indirect oxidation by reactive species e g ho ho2 o2 uv vis spectra ring cleavage total organic carbon toc and concentration of so4 2 for vuv and vu over 120 min are depicted in fig 2 we monitored benzene ring cleavage at the 224 nm spectral band fig 2 a and b 32 the rate of benzene cleavage was almost 3 2 times higher with vuv 91 at 60 min than uv 77 at 120 min interestingly the absorption peaks became wider and developed slight shoulders with the progression of both treatments indicating the presence of intermediate products vuv also had higher mineralization capacity than uv as indicated in fig 2 c by the lower toc content at 120 min 53 and 68 respectively so4 2 concentration followed a similar trend to benzene ring cleavage for both processes production of so4 2 ions accelerated dramatically after 30 min of vuv but not uv reaching a final ion concentration of 1 66 mg l and 0 63 mg l respectively so4 2 ions are produced by the breaking of a sulfonyl bond and their presence indicates that indirect advanced oxidation and direct photolysis both had effect these data suggest that indirect advanced oxidation occurred in vuv leading to more cleavage of sdbs benzene rings and sulfonyl groups than direct photolysis to identify the primary reactive species produced in each process we added radical scavengers tba or fa to the reactions fig 3 tba is a commonly used ho scavenger due to its high reaction rate constant 6 0 108 m 1s 1 36 as shown in fig 3 a tba inhibited sdbs degradation in a concentration dependent manner with k values of 0 0400 0 0142 0 0116 and 0 0084 min 1 for 0 1 10 and 100 mm respectively these results demonstrated that ho was the predominant reactive oxygen species formed by vuv for uv the k decreased slightly from 0 0125 to 0 0123 0 0102 and 0 0094 min 1 for the same concentrations to verify the generation of ho epr spectra were recorded using dmpo as the spin trapping agent vuv led to the formation of four lined spectra with relative intensities of 1 2 2 1 fig 4 a while the characteristic dmpo oh peaks were inconspicuous for the uv process fig 4 b hence the epr analysis confirmed that ho was produced exclusively by indirect oxidation in the vuv process and not by direct photolysis as seen in eq 4 8 fa can simultaneously scavenge ho and h and absorb 185 nm photons 37 38 as for tba fa gradually inhibited sdbs degradation by vuv fig 3 b with k values of 0 0400 0 0247 and 0 0195 min 1 for 0 20 and 50 u l respectively at 0 20 u l the degradation rate of sdbs tended to be stable because of the limitation of scavenging ho capacity however when the addition of fa increased to 50 u l the degradation rate of sdbs decreased significantly this result suggested that fa absorbed 185 nm photons фfa 185 фh2o 185 leading to a decrease in ho production 39 the uv process was almost unaffected by fa confirming that it hardly generates radical species relying on photolysis for sdbs degradation 4 hcooh or hco o hv 185 nm h 2 o co φ fa 185 1 5 hcooh ho hcoo h2o k 1 3 108 m 1s 1 6 hcooh h hcoo h2 k 6 1 107 m 1s 1 7 hcoo ho coo h2o k 3 2 109 m 1s 1 8 hcoo h coo h2 k 2 1 108 m 1s 1 3 2 effects of various factors on sdbs degradation 3 2 1 effect of initial sdbs concentration fig 5 shows the effect of initial sdbs concentration sdbs 0 on the kinetics of its degradation by vuv and uv increasing sdbs 0 steadily reduced the efficiency of the vuv process contrarily the effect was positive but mild with uv it is likely that sdbs 0 affected vuv and uv photon absorption in the aqueous solution which would alter the proportion of direct photolysis and indirect oxidation in the reaction the photon absorption fraction for each solution component was calculated for sdbs 0 of 10 15 and 20 mg l by eq 9 29 9 p i λ ε i λ c i i 1 i ε i λ c i 100 p i λ and ε i λ are respectively the photon absorption fraction and molar absorption coefficient cm 1m 1 determined with uv vis spectrophotometer based on the lambert beer law of a specific solution component i at a certain wavelength λ nm ci is the molar concentration m of a solution component i εi λci is the molar absorption of solution component i at λ nm wavelength note we used a molar absorption coefficient of 190 nm ε190 instead of 185 nm ε185 in these calculations as they were similar and the spectrophotometer available had a lower limit of 190 nm 29 we monitored the molar absorptions of sdbs at 190 nm and 254 nm by uv vis detector according to the molar absorption values of εi λci we could calculate the fraction of vuv and uv photons with eq 9 the molar absorption of sbds measured by uv vis at 190 nm was 1 0129 1 3335 1 5085 at varied concentrations of 10 15 20 mg l respectively vuv photons were mainly absorbed by h2o due to its high molarity ca 55 6 m and high molar absorption coefficient at 185 nm εh2o 185 3 2 10 2 cm 1m 1 and the molar absorption of h2o at 190 nm was 1 7792 the fraction of vuv photons absorbed by sdbs increased with the initial concentration 36 28 42 84 and 45 88 for 10 15 and 20 mg l respectively fig 6 a in diluted sdbs solutions with deionized water vuv photons absorbed by h2o could trigger the generation of large amounts of reactive species eqs 1 and 2 and more efficient degradation by indirect oxidation sdbs absorbed fewer photons and photolysis was limited higher initial sdbs concentrations allocated more vuv photons towards the less efficient photolysis the correspondent degradation rate also decreased 0 0400 0 0310 and 0 0269 min 1 with the concentration increasing other studies have also shown a reduced rate of contaminant degradation by vuv at higher initial concentrations 40 confirming that indirect oxidation is more efficient than photolysis uv photons behaved differently than vuv in their absorption and distribution the molar absorptions of sdbs measured by uv vis at 254 nm were 0 0116 0 0179 0 0225 at varied concentrations of 10 15 20 mg l respectively sdbs 0 affected slightly the adsorption of photons by h2o likely due to the small molar adsorption coefficient of h2o at 254 nm εh2o 254 2 0 10 4 cm 1m 1 40 and the low energy of photons u254 4 71 105 j einstein 1 the molar absorption of h2o was 0 01112 at 254 nm however the fraction of uv photons absorbed by sdbs increased to 51 06 61 68 and 66 92 at 10 15 and 20 mg l respectively fig 6 b the degradation rate also increased slightly 0 0104 0 0107 and 0 0111 min 1 for the same concentrations hence higher sdbs 0 slightly enhanced direct uv photolysis due to increases in the utilization rate of 254 nm photons in summary the distribution of vuv and uv absorbed photons suggested both indirect oxidation ho and direct photolysis contributed to sdbs degradation sdbs 0 considerably limited the efficiency of the vuv process due to reduction in reactive species generated and increase of sdbs photolysis yet vuv was still much more efficient than uv confirming indirect oxidation has a bigger role on sdbs degradation 3 2 2 effects of initial ph in fig 7 we analyzed the effect of solution ph from 3 to11 on the degradation of sdbs by vuv and uv ph had variable effects on the vuv process but influenced the uv system steadily we observed a higher degradation rate by vuv at ph of 5 and 9 k of 4 56 10 2 and 4 34 10 2 for ph 5 and 9 respectively several explanations are possible 1 deprotonated sdbs compounds at ph 9 could be more vulnerable to hydroxyl radicals than their undissociated forms at ph 3 41 2 the presence of h could enhance the scavenging of ho 42 3 the effect could be caused by a reduction in oxidation capacity as increasing ph from 0 to 7 will inhibit ho production and reduce its oxidation potential 2 59 v to 2 18 v 43 at higher ph ho dissociates into the oxygen anion radical o eq 10 44 and the h2o2 equilibrium equation right shifts from h2o2 to ho2 eq 11 45 increasing ho consumption o2 could be produced from ho2 and ho eqs 12 and 13 the lower oxidation potential of o and o2 compared to ho would reduce the degradation rate of sdbs at ph above the optimal value of 9 additionally the aqueous concentration of bicarbonate and carbonate increase with mineralization at high ph also contributing to a decrease in ho utilization the fact that ph 5 0 and 9 0 were optimal indicated that ho had comparative reactivity to around neutral ph condition and anionic forms of sdbs previous studies have shown similar effects of ph on the efficiency of vuv irradiation kutschera et al found that the degradation efficiency of geosmin and 2 methylisoborneol was higher at ph from 4 0 8 0 45 furthermore imoberdorf and mohseni reported that the optimal ph for the elimination of nom by vuv ranged from 5 0 9 0 38 by contrast degradation by uv increased progressively with the ph value the highest degradation rate was obtained in alkaline media k of 1 20 10 2 for a ph of 11 the effect is likely due to the presence of a higher fraction of dissociated sdbs at higher ph this process mimics the photolysis of deprotonated phenolic compounds which are decomposed almost an order of magnitude faster than their undissociated form 30 46 fig 7 effect of initial ph on sdbs degradation by vuv and uv conditions sdbs 0 10 mg l t 298 k reaction time 120 min the solid lines represent the best linear fit to the data the relative standard deviation for all data points was less than 5 10 ho o h pka 11 9 11 ho ho h2o2 pka 11 6 12 h2o2 ho2 h 13 ho2 ho o2 h2o these results indicate that ph can significantly affect target aqueous compound degradation by vuv and uv irradiation while sdbs photodegradation was enhanced by uv in alkaline media this condition was adverse for the vuv process nevertheless vuv still led to higher sdbs degradation rates than uv independent of ph 3 2 3 effects of temperature in fig 8 we tested the effect of solution temperatures ranging from 273 k to 303 k the temperature of the vuv and uv lamps was kept stable in these experiments to ensure the irradiation output was not affected elevating the temperature caused an obvious acceleration of sdbs degradation in both vuv and uv systems although with a smaller impact on the uv process k from 1 58 10 2 to 7 16 10 2 in vuv and 0 55 10 2 to 1 51 10 2 min 1 in uv from 273 to 303 k respectively this suggests that oxidation by ho could be dramatically enhanced by increasing the temperature of the vuv process generally the effective quantum yield of reactive radicals is determined by their instantaneous quantum yield and the fraction that can escape from the solvent cage there is a positive correlation between temperature and the quantum yield of reactive radicals due to the reduction in water viscosity and the improvement of diffusion controlled dissociation of the photo fragments 47 48 thus it is likely that higher temperatures led to more efficient vuv sdbs degradation by increasing the quantum yield of ho through the photolysis of water 49 to better understand the influence of temperature on the rate of sdbs degradation we created ln kobs vs 1 t plots for the four temperatures tested see insert on fig 8 the data had a good fit to the arrhenius equation calculated with the activation energy ea for photolysis of sdbs at 37 23 and 25 32 kj mol for vuv and uv respectively 3 2 4 effects of co existing inorganic anions fig 9 shows the effects of different concentrations 0 1 and 2 mm of inorganic anions so4 2 cl and hco3 on sdbs degradation by vuv and uv under vuv irradiation adding 1 mm of so4 2 accelerated the sdbs degradation by 4 while cl and hco3 inhibited it by 3 and 5 respectively the effects were more pronounced at 2 mm a 7 and 8 inhibition with cl and hco3 and 26 increase with so4 2 the competition of so4 2 with ho was insignificant due to its slow reaction eq 14 50 moreover the so4 produced under vuv irradiation could form ho eqs 15 and 16 51 which also promoted sdbs degradation to some extent other studies also found that so4 2 promoted pesticides degradation by vuv 27 51 the redox potential of so4 is comparable or higher than that of oh 2 5 3 1 v and 2 8 v respectively and so4 can oxidize most organics found in wastewater its lifespan is relatively long in the order of 30 40 μs 52 thus it is more stable than oh 20 ns with an enhanced chance to reacts with targeted pollutants contrarily eqs 17 and 18 27 show that cl and hco3 are scavengers of ho moreover the cl and hco3 can react with ho to form less reactive species thus suppressing sdbs degradation previous research showed that so4 based aops are more efficient for the abatement of most micropollutants than ho based 53 other studies have analyzed the effects of different inorganic anions on the degradation of multiple chemicals by vuv irradiation 27 51 cl and hco3 competed for vuv photons low absorption of uv photons at 254 nm with the other solution components thus suppressing both direct photolysis and indirect oxidation of sdbs moreover the results obtained in the presence of scavengers indicated that ho is a more efficient aop than cl or co3 14 so4 2 ho so4 oh 15 s o 4 2 hv 200 nm s o 4 e aq 16 so4 h2o hso4 ho 17 cl ho cl oh k 3 0 109m 1s 1 18 hco3 ho co3 h2o k 1 0 107m 1s 1 for the uv process so4 2 and cl did not affect sdbs degradation though hco3 promoted it slightly this phenomenon could be due to changes in solution ph as uv produces few active species and inorganic anions have low absorption of 254 nm photons accordingly the ph of the solution decreased from 8 64 to 7 42 and 7 28 for 1 and 2 mm of so4 2 and from 8 64 to 7 83 and 7 42 for 1 mm and 2 mm of cl sodium bicarbonate caused the ph to increase from 8 64 to 9 13 and 9 41 at 1 mm and 2 mm respectively this was consistent with the results obtained in the ph studies above fig 7 3 3 pathway of sdbs degradation by vuv to identify the pathway of degradation by the vuv process we analyzed a sdbs solution with 50 mg l by esi lc ms the fundamental peak in the mass spectrogram of the initial solution had marker ions for four main isomers at m h 297 311 325 and 339 m z substances with 325 m z corresponded to the dbs resulting from sdbs hydrolysis in water which also releases na sdbs molecules contain sulfonic acid groups which are easy to esterify with methanol and formic acid generating molecules with fragment ions 340 and 369 m z sdbs molecules lose hydrogen in the esi mode and become negatively charged by one unit the ion peak generated is 339 m z seen in mass spectrogram signal peaks 5 8 fig s1 the base peak of peak 5 was the product of propyl removal m h 297 another main ion peak present m h 339 corresponded to esterification products this indicated that the alkyl chain of sdbs had a propyl branch chain the base peak of peak 6 is 311 m z and four ions were present m h 297 311 325 and 339 m z the marker at 297 m z was the deethyl product of sdbs to be removed and at 311 and 339 were its esterification products this indicated that peak 6 corresponded to an ethyl branch chain of sdbs peak 7 had the base peak at 339 m z and two main fragment ion peaks at 311 and 325 m z the signal at 339 m z corresponded to a esterification product of sdbs 325 m z to the sdbs molecule or 339 m z demethylation products and m h 311 to sdbs demethylation products this indicated that the alkyl chain corresponding to peak 7 had a methyl branch chain the base peak of signal peak 8 is 339 m z in which there was a main fragment at 325 m z this corresponded to sdbs and its esterification products indicating that there was no branched chain in the alkyl chain of the sdbs isomer the main chemistry structural formula for sdbs in solution inferred from these data is in fig s3 from 20 90 min of vuv four predominant products were present at high concentrations m h 315 329 271 177 figs s8 s12 the relative abundance of intermediates increased and then decreased with irradiation time as seen in the fig s1 continuous attack of aromatic benzene ring derivatives by the ho radicals can lead to ring cleavage and complete mineralization hence it is important to note that the intermediates identified could represent only part of the sdbs degradation products there are two main mechanisms for ho action on sdbs 1 attack to the alkyl chain 2 attack to the ortho positions of the alkyl chain on the benzene ring 15 17 most of the primary photoproducts identified contained the sulphonate group this indicated that the carbon at the α position of the aromatic ring was the principal site of ho radical action that lead to the cleavage of the alkyl chain previous studies proposed a pathway leading to ho addition to the benzene ring at the ortho site of the alkyl chain due to the ortho and meta directing nature of the alkyl and sulphonate groups respectively 17 we could identify the reaction from intermediates p1 p2 and p3 table 1 in theory the attack of ho on the alkyl chain of sdbs can be expected to occur along the whole alkyl chain although it is more pausible that it occurs at the α and β positions yet it was the branched carbon that was affected as the molecular weight of the product generated by attacking α carbon and β carbon is much smaller than that of the base peak obtained we used the inferred molecular weight of the products to determine the branch chain position and concluded that r1 and r2 contained four carbon atoms and r3 and r4 contained five this indicated the presence of methyl ethyl and propyl groups in the branched chain which is consistent with the inferred sdbs mixture composition in the initial solution after comprehensive analysis we concluded that both methods of action 1 and 2 existed in this reaction based on the major indetified by products mentioned and the analysis above we propose the pathway sbds degradation in fig 10 at the beginning free electrons formed by the action of ho in the alkyl chain of sdbs which made the carbon atom active those reacted with the oxygen then ho cleaved the alkyl chain at the β position which led to the formation of a carbonyl group generating p3 and p4 finally ho and dissolved oxygen converted the alkyl chain of sdbs into a carboxyl group generating the p1 and p2 3 4 application of vuv and uv processes to real bathing and laundry wastewater to elucidate the influence of the water matrix on the degradation of anionic surfactants we applied vuv and uv to real bathing and laundry wastewater both treatments led to the degradation of surfactants fig 11 with vuv performing slightly better than uv surfactant degradation was accompanied with decreases in codcr and toc in bathing wastewater cod was reduced from 242 5 mg l to 207 6 mg l with vuv and 216 6 mg l with uv after 180 min toc declined from 69 18 mg l to 52 91 mg l and 60 03 mg l with vuv and uv respectively for laundry wastewater codcr went from 490 5 mg l to 439 2 mg l with vuv and 452 6 mg l with uv after 180 min toc declined from 158 56 mg l to 147 93 mg l and 153 18 mg l with vuv and uv respectively the degradation rate was inferior for wastewater than for the sdbs pure water experiments above this might be due to the scavenging of ho and uv photons by inorganic anions and organic matter present in sewage additionally sewage high turbidity might impede vuv and uv photons from propagating efficiently 4 conclusions in these experiments both vuv and uv irradiation could decompose sdbs efficiently yet the vuv process had a better removal performance at a same power consumption the main conclusions of this work were 1 indirect oxidation has a higher mineralization capacity than direct photolysis cleavage of benzene ring was completed after 60 min of vuv but uncompleted after 120 min of uv vuv also achieved a higher sdbs mineralization with toct toc0 decreasing to 53 within 120 min with uv it reached only 68 so4 2 ion concentration produced by the breaking of a sulfonyl bond reached 1 66 and 0 63 mg l for vuv and uv respectively 2 the vuv process was more efficient at solution ph of 5 and 9 while uv performed better at alkaline conditions temperature promoted the degradation of sdbs in both processes but with a higher impact on vuv adding so4 2 slightly accelerated degradation by vuv while cl and hco3 inhibited the process with uv so4 2 and cl had no effect but hco3 slightly promoted sdbs degradation by increasing the solution ph 3 indirection oxidation predominant in vuv was more susceptible to changes in external conditions than direct photolysis predominant in uv nevertheless indirect oxidation was overall more efficient in the degradation of sdbs than direct photolysis 4 at a high initial concentration we identified four sdbs isomers four possible major by products p1 p2 p3 p4 were identified with the analysis by lc ms of vuv irradiation with these data we proposed the pathway of sdbs degradation by the vuv process 5 vuv and uv at 180 min irradiation led to the degradation of 66 4 and 58 0 of anionic surfactants present in bathing wastewater for laundry wastewater 64 9 and 51 8 were degraded with vuv and uv respectively the vuv process was more efficient and led to a higher mineralization of surfactants in both samples tested this work will help the development of processes with optimal conditions for degradation of sdbs and find new ways to treat bathing and laundry wastewater declaration of competing interest the authors declared that they have no

14101,sodium dodecyl benzenesulfonate sdbs is a common anionic surfactant used in detergents and a major household pollutant sdbs released with bathing and laundry wastewater causes eutrophication of water bodies and toxicity in aquatic organisms we compared the degradation of sdbs in aqueous solution by vacuum ultraviolet vuv 254 nm and 185 nm and ultraviolet irradiation uv 254 nm using lab scale reactors vuv degraded sdbs more efficiently than uv also achieving a higher mineralization rate ho was the main reactive oxygen species produced by vuv sdbs concentration affected the distribution of absorbed vuv and uv photons and influenced the reaction triggered vuv was more efficient at lower concentrations when indirect oxidation by ho was prevalent the uv process relied mostly on direct photolysis and was affected slightly by initial concentration vuv was more efficient at solution ph of 5 and 9 while uv performed better at alkaline conditions temperature increased the degradation rates for both processes the addition of so4 2 slightly promoted sdbs degradation in the vuv process while cl and hco3 inhibited it for uv so4 2 and cl illustrated no significant difference on the degradation while hco3 had a positive impact on the system we identified the four photoproducts of sdbs degradation by vuv and proposed a degradation pathway finally the fact the vuv could be efficiently used to remove anionic surfactant from real wastewater proved that it can be applied efficiently with low energetic consumption keywords sdbs vacuum ultraviolet vuv ultraviolet uv bathing and laundry wastewater 1 introduction surfactants are widely employed in household cleaning detergents personal care products and in the industrial medical and biological fields they are one of the main household pollutants released with wastewater 1 5 the most common surfactants in detergents are anionic linear alkylbenzene sulfonates las 6 7 extensive use of las including the pervasive sodium dodecyl benzenesulfonate sdbs has serious environmental consequences through eutrophication of water bodies and toxic effects to aquatic organisms 8 9 various water treatment technologies including biological degradation coagulation advanced oxidation process aop membrane filtration and their combinations have been applied to las removal with variable results while an activated sludge process could remove 95 99 of las from sewage 10 11 the process was disturbed around 50 mg l las and even inhibited at higher concentrations 9 coagulation flocculation by fecl3 could efficiently remove 99 high surfactant concentrations from industrial wastewater but required large amounts of coagulant 12 polyethersulphone or polysulphone membrane filtration has also been used to remove surfactants but only retained 32 78 depending on the concentration 13 recently aops have been developed as part of water or wastewater treatment process they deployed potent oxidants including cl2 clo2 kmno4 o3 o3 h2o2 and o3 activated carbon oxidizing irradiation e g uv ultrasound and electron beam and plasma treatments 14 19 interestingly previous reports indicated that sdbs has a high reactivity with ho formed during o3 h2o2 process but slow reactivity with cl2 clo2 kmno4 and o3 18 this indicates that ho could be one of the most effective species for surfactant degradation recently vacuum ultraviolet vuv has gained great attention as an efficient and environmentally friendly method to produce ho during water or wastewater purification 20 vuv has wavelengths of 100 200 nm and is photo chemically active 21 185 nm photons are strongly absorbed by water molecules coefficient of 1 8 cm 1 causing the hemolysis and ionization of water molecules powerfully oxidizing hydroxyl radicals ho and h are then produced through eqs 1 and 2 22 23 the vuv process is more efficient than most uv based aops for degrading organic contaminants and inorganic ions and does not require additional oxidizing chemicals 24 it has been successfully applied to degrade multiple organic pollutant e g algal organic matter pesticides antibiotics phenolic compound in aqueous solution 25 30 high degradation rate 90 of five typical pesticides aldicarb alachlor chloroneb methiocarb and atrazine were achieved under vuv fluence of 12 mj cm 2 27 vuv was technically efficient for degradation of cloxacillin antibiotic and the addition of fe2 was more energy effective 28 vuv photo fenton process significantly enhanced the degradation and mineralization of sulfamethazine 29 all these studies have demonstrated the potential of vuv process for the water containing organic contaminants since sdbs can be efficiently removed by hydroxyl radicals an obvious removal effect can be expected under vuv irradiation 1 h2o hv185nm ho h ф1 0 33 2 h2o hv185nm h eaq ho ф2 0 045 bathing and laundry wastewater reuse has been limited by the lack of effective purification methods for example biodegradation requires long incubation cycles and adsorption has low recycling rates moreover uv based aops require the addition of oxidizing agents to the wastewater pipes which can be challenging and lead to toxicity of the treated solution hence the vuv process poses as a sustainable and oxidant free method to remove surfactant and other micro pollutants from wastewater allowing its reuse 31 despite the efforts to develop processes for surfactant removal the mechanisms of vuv and uv photo induced sdbs degradation have not been investigated before the aim of this paper was to investigate the mechanisms involved in sdbs oxidation by vuv and uv and identify the role of reactive species in each process we also analyzed the effects of different parameters in the systems including initial sdbs concentration ph temperature and presence of inorganic anions the pathway of sdbs degradation by vuv was also proposed finally the vuv and uv processwas seperately applied to real bathing and laundry wastewater to evaluate its practicability the results of this work offer a better understanding of the reaction mechanisms and outcomes of vuv which can be applied to the degradation of various organic micro pollutants 2 materials and method 2 1 chemicals all chemicals used were of analytical grade or higher and were used without further purification sdbs ar grade mixture seen in fig s1 sodium salts nacl

the reactor protected by a quartz tube and at 1 cm from its surface fig s2 the vuv lamp emitted radiation both at 254 nm 90 and 185 nm 10 according to 1 9 28 with the light intensities of 0 064 mw cm2 and 0 006 mw cm2 respectively the uv lamp emitted at 254 nm with an intensity of 0 069 mw cm2 light intensities were measured with a digital light power meter cel np2000 2 to reach a stable light output the lamps were turned on at least 20 min prior to the photochemical experiments the ph of the sdbs solution was adjusted to 3 5 7 9 or 11 with 0 1 mol l hcl or 0 1 mol l naoh the temperature was controlled in a water bath equipped with a thermostat and ranged from 273 k to 303 k the effects of inorganic anions so4 2 cl and hco3 on sdbs degradation was investigated at 0 1 and 2 mm all

1 sdbs degradation by the vuv and uv processes fig 1 shows the degradation of sdbs by the vuv and uv processes over a 120 min period overall vuv was more efficient than uv under the same conditions within 60 min of the treatment 91 of sdbs had been degraded by vuv while uv only achieved 67 at the final time point data for both treatments could be fitted with high linearity r2 0 999 with eq 3 indicating that they follow pseudo first order kinetics the sdbs degradation rate for vuv kvuv and uv kuv was 0 0400 and 0 0104 min 1 respectively next we investigated the mechanisms of sdbs degradation by vuv and uv while the uv process should rely almost exclusively on direct photolysis by λ 254 nm 29 vuv may act by direct photolysis by λ 185 nm and λ 254 nm and or indirect oxidation by reactive species e g ho ho2 o2 uv vis spectra ring cleavage total organic carbon toc and concentration of so4 2 for vuv and vu over 120 min are depicted in fig 2 we monitored benzene ring cleavage at the 224 nm spectral band fig 2 a and b 32 the rate of benzene cleavage was almost 3 2 times higher with vuv 91 at 60 min than uv 77 at 120 min interestingly the absorption peaks became wider and developed slight shoulders with the progression of both treatments indicating the presence of intermediate products vuv also had higher mineralization capacity than uv as indicated in fig 2 c by the lower toc content at 120 min 53 and 68 respectively so4 2 concentration followed a similar trend to benzene ring cleavage for both processes production of so4 2 ions accelerated dramatically after 30 min of vuv but not uv reaching a final ion concentration of 1 66 mg l and 0 63 mg l respectively so4 2 ions are produced by the breaking of a sulfonyl bond and their presence indicates that indirect advanced oxidation and direct photolysis both had effect these data suggest that indirect advanced oxidation occurred in vuv leading to more cleavage of sdbs benzene rings and sulfonyl groups than direct photolysis to identify the primary reactive species produced in each process we added radical scavengers tba or fa to the reactions fig 3 tba is a commonly used ho scavenger due to its high reaction rate constant 6 0 108 m 1s 1 36 as shown in fig 3 a tba inhibited sdbs degradation in a concentration dependent manner with k values of 0 0400 0 0142 0 0116 and 0 0084 min 1 for 0 1 10 and 100 mm respectively these results demonstrated that ho was the predominant reactive oxygen species formed by vuv for uv the k decreased slightly from 0 0125 to 0 0123 0 0102 and 0 0094 min 1 for the same concentrations to verify the generation of ho epr spectra were recorded using dmpo as the spin trapping agent vuv led to the formation of four lined spectra with relative intensities of 1 2 2 1 fig 4 a while the characteristic dmpo oh peaks were inconspicuous for the uv process fig 4 b hence the epr analysis confirmed that ho was produced exclusively by indirect oxidation in the vuv process and not by direct photolysis as seen in eq 4 8 fa can simultaneously scavenge ho and h and absorb 185 nm photons 37 38 as for tba fa gradually inhibited sdbs degradation by vuv fig 3 b with k values of 0 0400 0 0247 and 0 0195 min 1 for 0 20 and 50 u l respectively at 0 20 u l the degradation rate of sdbs tended to be stable because of the limitation of scavenging ho capacity however when the addition of fa increased to 50 u l the degradation rate of sdbs decreased significantly this result suggested that fa absorbed 185 nm photons фfa 185 фh2o 185 leading to a decrease in ho production 39 the uv process was almost unaffected by fa confirming that it hardly generates radical species relying on photolysis for sdbs degradation 4 hcooh or hco o hv 185 nm h 2 o co φ fa 185 1 5 hcooh ho hcoo h2o k 1 3 108 m 1s 1 6 hcooh h hcoo h2 k 6 1 107 m 1s 1 7 hcoo ho coo h2o k 3 2 109 m 1s 1 8 hcoo h coo h2 k 2 1 108 m 1s 1 3 2 effects of various factors on sdbs degradation 3 2 1 effect of initial sdbs concentration fig 5 shows the effect of initial sdbs concentration sdbs 0 on the kinetics of its degradation by vuv and uv increasing sdbs 0 steadily reduced the efficiency of the vuv process contrarily the effect was positive but mild with uv it is likely that sdbs 0 affected vuv and uv photon absorption in the aqueous solution which would alter the proportion of direct photolysis and indirect oxidation in the reaction the photon absorption fraction for each solution component was calculated for sdbs 0 of 10 15 and 20 mg l by eq 9 29 9 p i λ ε i λ c i i 1 i ε i λ c i 100 p i λ and ε i λ are respectively the photon absorption fraction and molar absorption coefficient cm 1m 1 determined with uv vis spectrophotometer based on the lambert beer law of a specific solution component i at a certain wavelength λ nm ci is the molar concentration m of a solution component i εi λci is the molar absorption of solution component i at λ nm wavelength note we used a molar absorption coefficient of 190 nm ε190 instead of 185 nm ε185 in these calculations as they were similar and the spectrophotometer available had a lower limit of 190 nm 29 we monitored the molar absorptions of sdbs at 190 nm and 254 nm by uv vis detector according to the molar absorption values of εi λci we could calculate the fraction of vuv and uv photons with eq 9 the molar absorption of sbds measured by uv vis at 190 nm was 1 0129 1 3335 1 5085 at varied concentrations of 10 15 20 mg l respectively vuv photons were mainly absorbed by h2o due to its high molarity ca 55 6 m and high molar absorption coefficient at 185 nm εh2o 185 3 2 10 2 cm 1m 1 and the molar absorption of h2o at 190 nm was 1 7792 the fraction of vuv photons absorbed by sdbs increased with the initial concentration 36 28 42 84 and 45 88 for 10 15 and 20 mg l respectively fig 6 a in diluted sdbs solutions with deionized water vuv photons absorbed by h2o could trigger the generation of large amounts of reactive species eqs 1 and 2 and more efficient degradation by indirect oxidation sdbs absorbed fewer photons and photolysis was limited higher initial sdbs concentrations allocated more vuv photons towards the less efficient photolysis the correspondent degradation rate also decreased 0 0400 0 0310 and 0 0269 min 1 with the concentration increasing other studies have also shown a reduced rate of contaminant degradation by vuv at higher initial concentrations 40 confirming that indirect oxidation is more efficient than photolysis uv photons behaved differently than vuv in their absorption and distribution the molar absorptions of sdbs measured by uv vis at 254 nm were 0 0116 0 0179 0 0225 at varied concentrations of 10 15 20 mg l respectively sdbs 0 affected slightly the adsorption of photons by h2o likely due to the small molar adsorption coefficient of h2o at 254 nm εh2o 254 2 0 10 4 cm 1m 1 40 and the low energy of photons u254 4 71 105 j einstein 1 the molar absorption of h2o was 0 01112 at 254 nm however the fraction of uv photons absorbed by sdbs increased to 51 06 61 68 and 66 92 at 10 15 and 20 mg l respectively fig 6 b the degradation rate also increased slightly 0 0104 0 0107 and 0 0111 min 1 for the same concentrations hence higher sdbs 0 slightly enhanced direct uv photolysis due to increases in the utilization rate of 254 nm photons in summary the distribution of vuv and uv absorbed photons suggested both indirect oxidation ho and direct photolysis contributed to sdbs degradation sdbs 0 considerably limited the efficiency of the vuv process due to reduction in reactive species generated and increase of sdbs photolysis yet vuv was still much more efficient than uv confirming indirect oxidation has a bigger role on sdbs degradation 3 2 2 effects of initial ph in fig 7 we analyzed the effect of solution ph from 3 to11 on the degradation of sdbs by vuv and uv ph had variable effects on the vuv process but influenced the uv system steadily we observed a higher degradation rate by vuv at ph of 5 and 9 k of 4 56 10 2 and 4 34 10 2 for ph 5 and 9 respectively several explanations are possible 1 deprotonated sdbs compounds at ph 9 could be more vulnerable to hydroxyl radicals than their undissociated forms at ph 3 41 2 the presence of h could enhance the scavenging of ho 42 3 the effect could be caused by a reduction in oxidation capacity as increasing ph from 0 to 7 will inhibit ho production and reduce its oxidation potential 2 59 v to 2 18 v 43 at higher ph ho dissociates into the oxygen anion radical o eq 10 44 and the h2o2 equilibrium equation right shifts from h2o2 to ho2 eq 11 45 increasing ho consumption o2 could be produced from ho2 and ho eqs 12 and 13 the lower oxidation potential of o and o2 compared to ho would reduce the degradation rate of sdbs at ph above the optimal value of 9 additionally the aqueous concentration of bicarbonate and carbonate increase with mineralization at high ph also contributing to a decrease in ho utilization the fact that ph 5 0 and 9 0 were optimal indicated that ho had comparative reactivity to around neutral ph condition and anionic forms of sdbs previous studies have shown similar effects of ph on the efficiency of vuv irradiation kutschera et al found that the degradation efficiency of geosmin and 2 methylisoborneol was higher at ph from 4 0 8 0 45 furthermore imoberdorf and mohseni reported that the optimal ph for the elimination of nom by vuv ranged from 5 0 9 0 38 by contrast degradation by uv increased progressively with the ph value the highest degradation rate was obtained in alkaline media k of 1 20 10 2 for a ph of 11 the effect is likely due to the presence of a higher fraction of dissociated sdbs at higher ph this process mimics the photolysis of deprotonated phenolic compounds which are decomposed almost an order of magnitude faster than their undissociated form 30 46 fig 7 effect of initial ph on sdbs degradation by vuv and uv conditions sdbs 0 10 mg l t 298 k reaction time 120 min the solid lines represent the best linear fit to the data the relative standard deviation for all data points was less than 5 10 ho o h pka 11 9 11 ho ho h2o2 pka 11 6 12 h2o2 ho2 h 13 ho2 ho o2 h2o these results indicate that ph can significantly affect target aqueous compound degradation by vuv and uv irradiation while sdbs photodegradation was enhanced by uv in alkaline media this condition was adverse for the vuv process nevertheless vuv still led to higher sdbs degradation rates than uv independent of ph 3 2 3 effects of temperature in fig 8 we tested the effect of solution temperatures ranging from 273 k to 303 k the temperature of the vuv and uv lamps was kept stable in these experiments to ensure the irradiation output was not affected elevating the temperature caused an obvious acceleration of sdbs degradation in both vuv and uv systems although with a smaller impact on the uv process k from 1 58 10 2 to 7 16 10 2 in vuv and 0 55 10 2 to 1 51 10 2 min 1 in uv from 273 to 303 k respectively this suggests that oxidation by ho could be dramatically enhanced by increasing the temperature of the vuv process generally the effective quantum yield of reactive radicals is determined by their instantaneous quantum yield and the fraction that can escape from the solvent cage there is a positive correlation between temperature and the quantum yield of reactive radicals due to the reduction in water viscosity and the improvement of diffusion controlled dissociation of the photo fragments 47 48 thus it is likely that higher temperatures led to more efficient vuv sdbs degradation by increasing the quantum yield of ho through the photolysis of water 49 to better understand the influence of temperature on the rate of sdbs degradation we created ln kobs vs 1 t plots for the four temperatures tested see insert on fig 8 the data had a good fit to the arrhenius equation calculated with the activation energy ea for photolysis of sdbs at 37 23 and 25 32 kj mol for vuv and uv respectively 3 2 4 effects of co existing inorganic anions fig 9 shows the effects of different concentrations 0 1 and 2 mm of inorganic anions so4 2 cl and hco3 on sdbs degradation by vuv and uv under vuv irradiation adding 1 mm of so4 2 accelerated the sdbs degradation by 4 while cl and hco3 inhibited it by 3 and 5 respectively the effects were more pronounced at 2 mm a 7 and 8 inhibition with cl and hco3 and 26 increase with so4 2 the competition of so4 2 with ho was insignificant due to its slow reaction eq 14 50 moreover the so4 produced under vuv irradiation could form ho eqs 15 and 16 51 which also promoted sdbs degradation to some extent other studies also found that so4 2 promoted pesticides degradation by vuv 27 51 the redox potential of so4 is comparable or higher than that of oh 2 5 3 1 v and 2 8 v respectively and so4 can oxidize most organics found in wastewater its lifespan is relatively long in the order of 30 40 μs 52 thus it is more stable than oh 20 ns with an enhanced chance to reacts with targeted pollutants contrarily eqs 17 and 18 27 show that cl and hco3 are scavengers of ho moreover the cl and hco3 can react with ho to form less reactive species thus suppressing sdbs degradation previous research showed that so4 based aops are more efficient for the abatement of most micropollutants than ho based 53 other studies have analyzed the effects of different inorganic anions on the degradation of multiple chemicals by vuv irradiation 27 51 cl and hco3 competed for vuv photons low absorption of uv photons at 254 nm with the other solution components thus suppressing both direct photolysis and indirect oxidation of sdbs moreover the results obtained in the presence of scavengers indicated that ho is a more efficient aop than cl or co3 14 so4 2 ho so4 oh 15 s o 4 2 hv 200 nm s o 4 e aq 16 so4 h2o hso4 ho 17 cl ho cl oh k 3 0 109m 1s 1 18 hco3 ho co3 h2o k 1 0 107m 1s 1 for the uv process so4 2 and cl did not affect sdbs degradation though hco3 promoted it slightly this phenomenon could be due to changes in solution ph as uv produces few active species and inorganic anions have low absorption of 254 nm photons accordingly the ph of the solution decreased from 8 64 to 7 42 and 7 28 for 1 and 2 mm of so4 2 and from 8 64 to 7 83 and 7 42 for 1 mm and 2 mm of cl sodium bicarbonate caused the ph to increase from 8 64 to 9 13 and 9 41 at 1 mm and 2 mm respectively this was consistent with the results obtained in the ph studies above fig 7 3 3 pathway of sdbs degradation by vuv to identify the pathway of degradation by the vuv process we analyzed a sdbs solution with 50 mg l by esi lc ms the fundamental peak in the mass spectrogram of the initial solution had marker ions for four main isomers at m h 297 311 325 and 339 m z substances with 325 m z corresponded to the dbs resulting from sdbs hydrolysis in water which also releases na sdbs molecules contain sulfonic acid groups which are easy to esterify with methanol and formic acid generating molecules with fragment ions 340 and 369 m z sdbs molecules lose hydrogen in the esi mode and become negatively charged by one unit the ion peak generated is 339 m z seen in mass spectrogram signal peaks 5 8 fig s1 the base peak of peak 5 was the product of propyl removal m h 297 another main ion peak present m h 339 corresponded to esterification products this indicated that the alkyl chain of sdbs had a propyl branch chain the base peak of peak 6 is 311 m z and four ions were present m h 297 311 325 and 339 m z the marker at 297 m z was the deethyl product of sdbs to be removed and at 311 and 339 were its esterification products this indicated that peak 6 corresponded to an ethyl branch chain of sdbs peak 7 had the base peak at 339 m z and two main fragment ion peaks at 311 and 325 m z the signal at 339 m z corresponded to a esterification product of sdbs 325 m z to the sdbs molecule or 339 m z demethylation products and m h 311 to sdbs demethylation products this indicated that the alkyl chain corresponding to peak 7 had a methyl branch chain the base peak of signal peak 8 is 339 m z in which there was a main fragment at 325 m z this corresponded to sdbs and its esterification products indicating that there was no branched chain in the alkyl chain of the sdbs isomer the main chemistry structural formula for sdbs in solution inferred from these data is in fig s3 from 20 90 min of vuv four predominant products were present at high concentrations m h 315 329 271 177 figs s8 s12 the relative abundance of intermediates increased and then decreased with irradiation time as seen in the fig s1 continuous attack of aromatic benzene ring derivatives by the ho radicals can lead to ring cleavage and complete mineralization hence it is important to note that the intermediates identified could represent only part of the sdbs degradation products there are two main mechanisms for ho action on sdbs 1 attack to the alkyl chain 2 attack to the ortho positions of the alkyl chain on the benzene ring 15 17 most of the primary photoproducts identified contained the sulphonate group this indicated that the carbon at the α position of the aromatic ring was the principal site of ho radical action that lead to the cleavage of the alkyl chain previous studies proposed a pathway leading to ho addition to the benzene ring at the ortho site of the alkyl chain due to the ortho and meta directing nature of the alkyl and sulphonate groups respectively 17 we could identify the reaction from intermediates p1 p2 and p3 table 1 in theory the attack of ho on the alkyl chain of sdbs can be expected to occur along the whole alkyl chain although it is more pausible that it occurs at the α and β positions yet it was the branched carbon that was affected as the molecular weight of the product generated by attacking α carbon and β carbon is much smaller than that of the base peak obtained we used the inferred molecular weight of the products to determine the branch chain position and concluded that r1 and r2 contained four carbon atoms and r3 and r4 contained five this indicated the presence of methyl ethyl and propyl groups in the branched chain which is consistent with the inferred sdbs mixture composition in the initial solution after comprehensive analysis we concluded that both methods of action 1 and 2 existed in this reaction based on the major indetified by products mentioned and the analysis above we propose the pathway sbds degradation in fig 10 at the beginning free electrons formed by the action of ho in the alkyl chain of sdbs which made the carbon atom active those reacted with the oxygen then ho cleaved the alkyl chain at the β position which led to the formation of a carbonyl group generating p3 and p4 finally ho and dissolved oxygen converted the alkyl chain of sdbs into a carboxyl group generating the p1 and p2 3 4 application of vuv and uv processes to real bathing and laundry wastewater to elucidate the influence of the water matrix on the degradation of anionic surfactants we applied vuv and uv to real bathing and laundry wastewater both treatments led to the degradation of surfactants fig 11 with vuv performing slightly better than uv surfactant degradation was accompanied with decreases in codcr and toc in bathing wastewater cod was reduced from 242 5 mg l to 207 6 mg l with vuv and 216 6 mg l with uv after 180 min toc declined from 69 18 mg l to 52 91 mg l and 60 03 mg l with vuv and uv respectively for laundry wastewater codcr went from 490 5 mg l to 439 2 mg l with vuv and 452 6 mg l with uv after 180 min toc declined from 158 56 mg l to 147 93 mg l and 153 18 mg l with vuv and uv respectively the degradation rate was inferior for wastewater than for the sdbs pure water experiments above this might be due to the scavenging of ho and uv photons by inorganic anions and organic matter present in sewage additionally sewage high turbidity might impede vuv and uv photons from propagating efficiently 4 conclusions in these experiments both vuv and uv irradiation could decompose sdbs efficiently yet the vuv process had a better removal performance at a same power consumption the main conclusions of this work were 1 indirect oxidation has a higher mineralization capacity than direct photolysis cleavage of benzene ring was completed after 60 min of vuv but uncompleted after 120 min of uv vuv also achieved a higher sdbs mineralization with toct toc0 decreasing to 53 within 120 min with uv it reached only 68 so4 2 ion concentration produced by the breaking of a sulfonyl bond reached 1 66 and 0 63 mg l for vuv and uv respectively 2 the vuv process was more efficient at solution ph of 5 and 9 while uv performed better at alkaline conditions temperature promoted the degradation of sdbs in both processes but with a higher impact on vuv adding so4 2 slightly accelerated degradation by vuv while cl and hco3 inhibited the process with uv so4 2 and cl had no effect but hco3 slightly promoted sdbs degradation by increasing the solution ph 3 indirection oxidation predominant in vuv was more susceptible to changes in external conditions than direct photolysis predominant in uv nevertheless indirect oxidation was overall more efficient in the degradation of sdbs than direct photolysis 4 at a high initial concentration we identified four sdbs isomers four possible major by products p1 p2 p3 p4 were identified with the analysis by lc ms of vuv irradiation with these data we proposed the pathway of sdbs degradation by the vuv process 5 vuv and uv at 180 min irradiation led to the degradation of 66 4 and 58 0 of anionic surfactants present in bathing wastewater for laundry wastewater 64 9 and 51 8 were degraded with vuv and uv respectively the vuv process was more efficient and led to a higher mineralization of surfactants in both samples tested this work will help the development of processes with optimal conditions for degradation of sdbs and find new ways to treat bathing and laundry wastewater declaration of competing interest the authors declared that they have no

14102,nanofiltration nf is an attractive surface water treatment option for the enhanced removal of natural organic matter nom to comply with the regulations of potentially toxic disinfection by products dbps formation however organic fouling has remained an unresolved issue which makes the process less cost effective to address this problem the current study reports on the fabrication of a new thin film nanocomposite tfn membrane incorporated with and decorated by amine functionalized boron nitride bn nh2 nanosheets physicochemical investigations revealed 60 and 40 enhancement in hydrophilicity and negative charge density of the modified membranes respectively which translated into 69 improvement in flux as well as boosted nom removal and fouling resistance compared with control counterparts additionally the modified membranes exhibited a better filtration performance under detrimental solution chemistry conditions of low ph and high ca2 concentration liquid chromatography coupled with organic carbon detection lc ocd profiles and fluorescence excitation emission matrices feem demonstrated the capability of the modified membranes in removing humics and lower molecular sized compounds from water as opposed to moderate removals achieved in a conventional water treatment plant finally aquasim simulations showed the lower chlorine demand of the nf treated water which can reflect on its decreased dbps formation potential keywords thin film nanocomposite membrane boron nitride nanosheets bn nh2 natural organic matter removal fouling resistance aquasim simulation 1 introduction chlorine is the most widely used disinfectant in water treatment plants which provides an economical approach to prevent microbial contamination in the treated water however residual chlorine can react with natural organic matter nom which is ubiquitous in all surface waters and produce potentially carcinogenic disinfection by products dbps 1 considering drastic changes in surface water quality associated with rising nom concentrations conventional treatment processes can no longer guarantee sufficient nom removal which will increase the risk of the formation of dbps 2 the application of nanofiltration nf in surface water treatment is a promising strategy to comply with the strict drinking water guidelines in relation to dbps 3 the unique ability of nf to separate low molecular weight lmw organics has resulted in its recent rapid growth to replace conventional processes or to be integrated with them for surface water treatment 4 7 significant reductions of over 90 in chlorine demand of treated waters have also been reported for nf as opposed to 72 obtained for conventional treatment 8 the simultaneous increase in nom removal and decrease in chlorine demand achieved with nf can reduce the formation of dbps thus providing consumers with better water quality in spite of the aforementioned advantages organic fouling disrupts the sustained operation of the nf by reducing the permeation over time 9 10 organic fouling which originates from the attachment of nom onto the membrane surface is strongly affected by the feed solution chemistry for instance acidic ph conditions and high ca2 concentrations exacerbate the fouling by facilitating the chemisorption of nom onto the membrane surface leading to fast kinetics of dense cake layer formation 11 12 furthermore both ph and presence of cations have a fundamental influence on the molecular size and shape of nom species which can also affect the membrane separation efficiency 13 an effective approach to mitigate the fouling propensity and enhancing the separation efficiency is optimizing the physicochemical properties of the selective polypiperazine amide ppa layer of thin film composite tfc membranes this may be achieved by introducing nanomaterials during the interfacial polymerization ip process to enhance the hydrophilicity and negative charge density of the ppa film 14 application of nanomaterials within the thin film has progressed from conventional metal oxides to the state of the art nanoarchitectures like functionalized carbon nanotubes cnts graphene based nanoparticles metal organic frameworks mofs cellulose nanocrystals and zwitterionic nanomaterials 15 19 as new additions to the class of 2 dimentional 2d materials amine functionalized boron nitride bn nh2 nanosheets that are synthesized via a sustainable approach based on the ball milling of hexagonal bn and urea can also be employed as nanofillers during the ip process 20 chemical bonding between unreacted b atoms nh2 moieties at the edges of nanosheets and available acyl chloride groups of the ppa layer enhances their stability in the thin film which is advantageous in long term filtration operations additionally polarity of amine functional groups and their tendency to absorb water molecules through hydrogen bonding and electron deficiency of unreacted b atoms which make them prone to acquire hydroxyl ligands in water can boost the membrane surface hydrophilicity and negative charge density respectively thus mitigating the organic fouling of membranes 20 22 in spite of the aforementioned improvements in the materials and modification of membranes most research works to date have mainly focused on the implementation of thin film nanocomposite tfn membranes for desalination or employed limited model nom compounds to evaluate the membrane filtration performance 23 25 little is known regarding the efficiency of tfn membranes in dealing with different fractions of nom in real water bodies and the associated fouling phenomenon additionally there is merit in modifying the ip technique to fabricate thin films which exhibit the highest possible exposure and interaction of nanomaterials with foulants to address these shortcomings the current study focuses on the fabrication of a high flux loose tfn membrane modified with amine functionalized boron nitride bn nh2 nanosheets to exploit the ultimate potential of nanosheets and maximize the filtration efficiency ip process was tuned in a way to yield a double functionalized ppa film incorporated with and decorated by bn nh2 nanosheets physicochemical properties of the resultant membranes were carefully characterized and the nf performance was evaluated through cross flow filtration of a surface water with a moderate nom content experimental results were benchmarked by control membranes and the process efficiency in term of nom removal and permeate chlorine demand was also compared with that of a conventional drinking water treatment plant finally effects of solution chemistry on membranes filtration performance was investigated by varying ph and ca2 concentration and the nature of foulants was identified through spectroscopic studies on the fouled membranes 2 experimental section 2 1 chemicals and materials commercial trisep xn45 nf membrane 500 da was purchased from sterlitech

aqueous 2 wt pip 2 wt tea and 2 wt csa in water and organic 0 1 wt tmc in n hexane solutions on the pes substrate a plate and frame assembly was used to hold the membrane in place while being contacted with aqueous and organic solutions for 2 and 1 min respectively the established ppa layer was then heat treated in an oven at 50 c for 5 min to evaporate the residual solvents and enhance

electrolyte revealed the surface charge density of membranes under varying ph conditions which were adjusted by 0 1 m sodium hydroxide or hydrogen chloride solutions mwco value of membranes was evaluated by measuring the rejection of neutral solutes i e glucose maltose raffinose and α cyclodextrine at 6 bar where applicable measurements were performed on triplicate samples and average results were reported 2 4 sample collection surface water samples used in this study were collected from the wurdee boluc wb treatment plant situated in the geelong region state of victoria australia raw water to the treatment plant is sourced from the nearby wb reservoir samples of treated water were also collected from the treatment plant for comparison noteworthy is that wb treatment plant uses a conventional treatment chain composed of coagulation filtration disinfection and fluorination to treat water table 1 shows the characteristics of the raw and treated water samples collected from the treatment plant 2 5 design of nf experiments cross flow filtration experiments were conducted on a sterlitech cf042 module connected to a hydra cell pump to measure the permeation nom removal fouling resistance and long term operational performance of membranes a schematic diagram of nf setup used for the filtration experiments is presented in fig s1 in the supplementary material section membrane coupons were first compacted with di water at 8 bar for 150 min prior to pure water flux measurements at 6 bar according to eq 1 1 j v s t where j is the membrane flux in l m 2 h 1 v is the permeate volume in l collected in time t h and s is the membrane surface area in m2 filtration of the feed solution was conducted at 6 bar and room temperature and normalized flux as an indicator of membrane fouling propensity was calculated at the termination of the experiment according to eq 2 2 n o r m a l i z e d f l u x j t j 0 100 where jt is the flux at the termination of the experiment and j0 is the flux at the start of the filtration since all surface water samples were pre filtered using the 0 45 μm cn membranes prior to use biological organisms were not considered to be a significant part of the membrane fouling operational stability of membranes were evaluated through long term filtration experiments 52 h at 6 bar preceded by a 2 h compaction with di water at 8 bar to avoid nom decay feed reservoir was kept refrigerated at 4 c and concentrate stream was circulated in 44 m of stainless steel coils kept in a 0 8 c water bath before being recirculated to the feed reservoir 2 6 water quality analyses and characterization the treated water from the wb treatment plant along with the feed and permeate samples of the filtration experiments were evaluated for nom content through a variety of techniques doc was measured using a total organic carbon analyzer from shimadzu japan and uv254 was quantified employing a paro 300 spectrophotometer equipped with a quartz cuvette rejection values were then calculated according to eq 3 3 r c f c p c f 100 where r is the rejection in and cf and cp are the solute concentrations in the feed and permeate wb treated water samples respectively in mg l 1 for doc and cm 1 for uv254 performance of the membranes in removing different fractions of nom were investigated through size exclusion chromatography sec and fluorescence spectroscopy sec was performed on a model 8 liquid chromatography organic carbon detector lc ocd from doc labor germany samples were filtered using a pre rinsed 0 45 μm cellulose acetate filter before analysis a 2 ml injection volume was used for a retention time of 120 min in a single sec column with mobile phase at 1 1 ml min 1 the sec column separates nom species based on their hydrodynamic molecular size at varying retention times where smaller molecules have long retention times and larger molecules elute faster accordingly biopolymers and humic substances elute at 30 min t 45 min and 45 min t 59 min respectively while lmw acids and lmw neutral compounds elute at 59 min t 66 min and t 66 min in turn fluorescence excitation emission matrix feem of water samples was recorded on a carry eclipse varian usa spectrophotometer in the excitation range 220 420 nm and emission range 300 600 nm with the excitation and emission slits of 5 nm in order to remove the raman scattering and reducing the background noise fluorescence spectra of milli q water was obtained under similar conditions and subtracted from the samples spectra 2 7 application of aquasim software to model the chlorine decay upon disinfection in water treatment plants chlorine decay occurs in bulk waters due to the simultaneous reactions of chlorine with a variety of residual nom this process can be theoretically modelled to determine the chlorine demand of the feed and or the waters treated employing different treatment options allowing to evaluate the efficiency of selected process in reducing dbps formation potential 26 free chlorine cl2 dosed to the system can react with fast reducing agents fra fast reducing nitrogenous substances frn slow reducing agents sra and slow reducing nitrogenous substances srn a reaction scheme provided by jegatheesan et al suggested that the reaction between cl2 and fra sra will produce inert products and dbps and the reaction between cl2 and frn srn will generate inert products and combined chlorine cc where cc will be further converted into inert products the combination of cl2 and cc is translated into the total chlorine tc and it is the tc demand that determine the effectiveness of the treatment process in reducing dbps formation potential 8 a mathematical model that takes into account both the initial rapid decay and the continuing slow decay employing the following eqs 4 6 can be constructed in aquasim to determine the decay of cl2 and cc by performing parameter estimation and approximating the tc demand of the water 4 d c l 2

fra frn sra and srn respectively and k5 is the reaction rate of the conversion of cc to inert products to perform the experiments samples of feed wb treated and ppa bn permeate waters were used for chlorine decay evaluations briefly two 2 l batches of each sample were dosed with sodium hypochlorite to yield 2 and 4 mg l 1 of free chlorine and were kept in brown glass bottles to avoid the interfering effects of light the total and free chlorine concentrations were recorded immediately after sodium hypochlorite dosing and then at specific time intervals for a total of 168 h the chlorine measurements were conducted using a hach pocket colorimeter equipped with swiftest dpd reagent dispensers the measurement results were then used to obtain the aquasim model parameters and estimate the chlorine demand of the samples 2 8 effect of solution chemistry on nf performance in order to study the effect of solution chemistry on the nom rejection and fouling resistance properties of membranes filtration experiments were performed under two different conditions being a 6 bar pressure and ph 5 and b 6 bar pressure 1 mm ca2 and ph 7 ph values of the raw surface water were adjusted using 0 1 m hydrogen chloride or sodium hydroxide solutions and ca2 concentration was adjusted using calcium chloride at the termination of the experiments normalized flux values and nom rejection in terms of doc and uv254 were calculated using eqs 2 and 3 atr ftir was also employed to investigate the chemical structure of foulants deposited on the fouled membranes measurement were performed on triplicate samples to ensure the reproducibility of the results 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of membranes the as fabricated ppa and ppa bn as well as the commercial xn45 membranes were characterized physically and chemically to probe the determinative surface properties in relation to filtration performance as shown in the sem and afm images presented in fig 2 a d both ppa and ppa bn membranes exhibit a finely nodular background matrix signature of interfacially polymerized pip tmc networks referring to fig 2 a and c introduction of nanosheets during the modified ip process visibly changed the micromorphology of the surface to yield a thin film consisting of wrinkle shaped bulges and studded with bn nh2 nanosheets as indicated with the red circles in fig 2 c formation of these wrinkle shaped tufts is mainly ascribed to the interference of bn nh2 nanosheets with pip diffusion towards the interface of immiscible solutions during the ip process thus manipulating the reaction kinetics accordingly amine moieties and unreacted b atoms available at the edges of nanosheets can compete with pip to react with tmc and may result in ppa formation following multiple growth directions 27 28 further functionalization of the already formed bn nh2 incorporated pip tmc network with nanosheets will also result in the formation of covalent cb bonds between the unreacted acyl chlorides of tmc and electron deficient b atoms 21 therefore chemical bonding rather than physical blending can promise stable performance of the ppa bn membrane and will eliminate the possibility of nanosheet leaching out from the membrane surface during filtration practices 29 morphological observations made through sem images are consistent with the surface topography and roughness parameters obtained from the afm micrographs presented in fig 2 b and d as can be seen the bare ppa membrane possesses a smooth surface with an rq value of only 8 0 94 nm while the ppa bn membrane exhibits a slightly rougher surface at rq of 12 1 67 nm due to the formation of wrinkle shaped microarchitectures both membrane can be categorized as being extremely smooth compared with the literature data on similar types of tfn membranes 30 32 with regards to the xn45 membrane fig 2 e and f show that the membrane surface is firmly packed with evenly distributed globular nodules which are bigger in size and density compared to those of the ppa and ppa bn membranes therefore the xn45 membrane possesses a higher surface roughness while still being categorized as a smooth membrane high surface roughness is generally expected to enhance water permeability and deteriorate the membrane fouling at the same time as water flows from ridges to valleys the diffusion path length becomes shorter and the surface area available for the formation of a hydration layer expands which will result in an overall higher flow rate however the foulants may also be trapped and accumulate in the valleys deteriorating the fouling 17 25 nevertheless the ultimate fouling resistance property of a membrane is also dependent upon surface chemical characteristics and is therefore a function of both hydrophilicity and charge density in addition to roughness so it is of paramount importance to define the filtration performance and fouling behavior of membranes with respect to both physical and chemical properties of the thin films the chemical composition of the surface of membranes was investigated by atr ftir spectroscopy presented in fig 3 a as indicated with the orange shaded areas all membranes exhibit characteristic bands of a polysulfone substrate in the wavenumber ranges of 3060 3030 and or 1145 1100 cm 1 representing ch aromatic ring and symmetric so2 stretching vibration respectively 33 34 while the ppa and ppa bn membranes exhibit bands in both regions the xn45 commercial membrane possess strong bands only in the 1145 1100 cm 1 range and the signals are rather weak in the 3060 3030 cm 1 region traces of the ppa chemistry can also be clearly seen in the spectra of all membranes for instance the broad band at 3440 cm 1 corresponds to the nh and oh stretching the band at 1727 1663 cm 1 arise from the co stretching of amide group and the band appearing at 1441 cm 1 is related to the cn stretching and in plane nh deformation vibrations 32 34 also the signal of the band located at 1375 cm 1 grows in intensity for the ppa bn membrane which indicates the existence of more amine functional groups on the membrane surface after bn nh2 addition it is worth noting that the spectrum of the xn45 membrane also shows a band at 1375 cm 1 that may originate from the ch symmetric deformation of aliphatic carbon moieties of a preserving coating layer such as polyvinyl alcohol which is not usually revealed by the manufacturers this may be further confirmed by the additional bands at 3000 2900 cm 1 as well as the higher intensity of the band at 3440 cm 1 compared with other membranes proving the existence of additional oh groups arising from a coating layer 33 nevertheless the higher intensity of the 3440 cm 1 band can also be ascribed to the higher content of ppa on the surface of the xn45 membrane surface hydrophilicity is an important characteristic in controlling the fouling phenomenon and improving the permeation and rejection properties of membranes through changing the physical and chemical interactions of nom with the membrane surface 35 the surface hydrophilicity of the membranes was evaluated by ca measurements and presented in fig 3 b the recorded ca values descended from 32 1 8 for the ppa membrane to 9 0 9 for the xn45 exhibiting the super hydrophilic behavior of the thin films also double functionalization of the ppa layer with bn nh2 nanosheets improved the hydrophilic character of the membrane due to the polarity of amine functional groups and their tendency to absorb water molecules through hydrogen bonding 27 36 as a results the ppa bn membrane possessed a ca of 20 1 9 showing 60 greater hydrophilicity than the control ppa counterpart streaming potential measurements were conducted to investigate the surface charge properties of the membranes under varying solution ph conditions the existence of carboxyl and amine functional groups in the structure of ppa films affect the material charge typically leading to more negatively charged films for high carboxylic contents membranes possess positive charge under acidic conditions due to the protonation of amine moieties and hold negative charge with increasing ph above their isoelectric point iep due to the dissociation of carboxylic groups 37 as seen in fig 3 c presence of bn nh2 nanosheets inside and above the ppa film enhanced the membrane surface negative charge density significantly so that at ph 7 the streaming potential value of the ppa bn membrane at 70 mv was 40 greater than that of the ppa at 50 mv this improvement can be attributed to the lewis acidity of electron deficient b atoms available at the edges of nanosheets and their tendency to acquire hydroxyl ligands 38 39 our previous studies have also shown that tfn membranes incorporated with or decorated by bn nh2 where the nanosheets are either within the ppa layer or above it possessed greater negative charge density compared with the control counterpart 21 22 eventually neutral solute rejection and mwco of fabricated membranes were estimated through filtration of glucose maltose raffinose and α cyclodextrin according to the literature mwco is referred to the molecular weight of a neutral solute 90 of which is rejected by the membrane 40 fig 3 d presents that the rejection figures of both ppa and ppa bn membranes to neutral solutes with different molecular weights ranging from 180 16 to 972 84 g mol 1 followed a linear trend upon fitting the data the mwco values of the ppa and ppa bn membranes were estimated at 890 and 978 da respectively these values stand well within the range reported for loose nf membranes derived from the polycondensation reaction between pip and tmc which yields a semi aromatic and partially cross linked network 41 compared to the control ppa membrane the increased mwco of the ppa bn membrane can be ascribed to the formation of nanogaps due to the interfering effect of nanosheets in the ip process yielding a thin film with lower degree of cross linking indeed formation of the nanogaps between nanosheets and polymeric matrix may result in the generation of wider pathways for the transport of solutes through the microstructure of the thin film 35 although separation performance of charged nf membranes is based on charge interaction and size exclusion sieving effects mechanisms considering the neutral nature of the model solutes only sieving mechanism was responsible for the rejection performance of the membranes and as a result rejection decreased with increasing the membrane free volume 42 3 2 effect of bn nh2 nanosheets on the filtration performance of membranes results of the filtration performance of the membranes including pure water flux nom rejection and normalized flux after 6 h filtration at 6 bar ph 7 and ambient temperature conditions are presented in fig 4 a accordingly the pure water flux of the ppa membrane is 43 2 l m 2 h 1 which increases by almost 69 to 72 9 l m 2 h 1 after the introduction of bn nh2 nanosheets during the ip process as discussed in the previous section the ppa bn membrane possesses more free volume under the effect of nanogaps formed in the presence of bn nh2 nanosheets compared to the ppa counterpart which results in the generation of higher water flux through the membrane also greater hydrophilicity and surface roughness of the ppa bn enhance the wettability characteristics of the membrane and facilitate the mobility of water molecules through the thin film the pure water flux of the xn45 membrane is lower than that of the ppa bn at 50 4 0 51 l m 2 h 1 which can be ascribed to its tighter structure mwco 500 da accommodating lower flow of water nevertheless when compared with the ppa counterpart possessing a looser network mwco 890 da it can be deduced that greater surface roughness and hydrophilicity of the xn45 membrane played a major role in enhancing the flux in this regard boussu et al have also shown that despite its tighter structure the desal51hl 190 da membrane yielded a higher water permeance at 11 4 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 compared with 5 7 and 3 8 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 for ntr7450 310 and n30 f 680 respectively that can originate from its higher hydrophilicity and surface roughness 43 referring to the data in the table 1 on the characteristics of the raw surface water used as the feed in this study the specific uv absorbance suva value can be calculated at 1 2 l mg 1 m 1 the suva has been shown to strongly correlate with the hydrophobic organic acid fraction of nom and is a useful approximation of nom aromaticity and molecular weight 44 46 therefore the suva value obtained for the feed water indicates that organic species are of low aromaticity and molecular weight hence it is expected that the tightest membrane xn45 exhibits the greatest nom removal as long as steric exclusion mechanism is concerned nevertheless fig 4 a shows that the rejection of nom in terms of uv254 and doc increases in the order of xn45 500 da ppa 890 da ppa bn 978 da quantitatively the ppa and ppa bn membranes fabricated in this study supported the removal of more than 90 of nom expressed as uv254 and 83 3 and 89 respectively in terms of doc whereas the xn45 removed around 87 and 71 of uv254 and doc in turn since nom is predominantly composed of negatively charged species 47 the low rejection figure for xn45 can be attributed to its lower surface negative charge density compared to that of the ppa bn reducing the extent of charge repulsions between nom and the membrane surface 48 therefore it can be concluded that charge interactions play a more significant role than steric exclusion in controlling the removal of nom using membranes other research groups have also delivered similar conclusion among which song et al have shown that a negatively charged uf membrane with a mwco of 100 kda can separate more nom at 84 7 than a neutral but tighter counterpart with a mwco of 30 kda at 68 9 they have further claimed that charge modified uf membranes can be potential substitutes for nf membranes in nom removal applications 48 despite carrying a higher surface negative charge density compared to the ppa membrane the lower rejection of the xn45 may also originate from its superhydrophilic surface facilitating the passage of hydrophilic nom through the thin film microstructure 49 accordingly the xn45 membrane possesses a more hydrophilic surface than the ppa and since the nom used in the current study is also of hydrophilic nature as confirmed by suva measurements it can be deduced that the xn45 membrane can facilitate the passage of organics specifically the low molecular weight neutral compounds that are abundant in the feed solution through its nanoporous network this can be confirmed by referring to the uv254 rejection values where both membrane exhibited similar removal efficiency for larger more aromatic and hydrophobic compounds therefore it can be deduced that smaller and more hydrophilic organics were responsible for the lower nom removal in terms of doc of the xn45 membrane furthermore the surface of the ppa membrane has lower hydrophilicity and negative charge density than that of the xn45 which results in its higher fouling the fouling layer formed above the ppa surface can act as an additional barrier towards the passage of nom and results in higher rejection figures for this membrane also aggregation of the negatively charged foulants on the membrane can enhance the negative charge density of the ppa further repelling the organics away from the surface 29 50 overall due to the complexity of nom composition and its physicochemical interactions with the membrane surface different factors can affect nom retention to varied extents briefly characterization of some other australian surface water resources has shown great variations across the nom concentration and aromaticity with reported doc and suva values ranging from 5 2 mg l 1 and 2 5 l mg 1 m 1 for the moondarra reservoir in victoria to 12 8 mg l 1 and 3 6 l mg 1 m 1 for myponga reservoir in south australia 51 the fouling resistance properties of membranes were also evaluated at the termination of the filtration experiments through measurements of the normalized flux and results are presented in fig 4 a compared to the ppa membrane the ppa bn maintained a greater extent of the initial flux at 95 after 6 h which is due to the improved hydrophilicity and negative charge density of its surface enhanced wettability and the facilitated development of a water hydration layer over the surface together with the improved electrostatic repulsive forces in the presence of bn nh2 nanosheets helped keeping nom away from the membrane surface thus mitigating the organic fouling phenomenon 48 the longevity and operational stability of membranes were assessed through long term 52 h filtration studies results of which are presented in fig s2 in the supplementary material section all membranes underwent reductions in the initial flux to varying extents with the ppa membrane exhibiting the greatest decline to 54 compared to 80 for the ppa bn also in the case of the ppa and xn45 membranes a significant proportion of the flux reduction occurred during the first hours 0 8 h of the filtration experiments in contrast the ppa bn counterpart showed the most stable performance at the beginning and throughout the 52 h filtration which can be ascribed to its desirable surface properties in terms of charge and hydrophilicity li and elimelech have shown that the fouling process at the early stage is controlled by the interactions between the foulants and the clean membrane surface and therefore the interaction forces determine the initial rate of fouling 52 also according to fane and chang membrane fouling in loose nf membranes is dominated by the pore constriction mechanism during the initial stage of the fouling process that can lead to irreversible entrapment of foulants inside the thin film 53 taken together it can be suggested that the greater initial fouling can result in the more severe irreversible fouling of membranes that require intermittent chemical cleaning for the partial complete recovery of the initial flux 54 in the current study both ppa and xn45 membranes underwent severe initial fouling in the first two hours of the filtration whereas the ppa bn membrane exhibited a more stable behaviour at the beginning and throughout the experiment while the rapid flux decline of the ppa and xn45 membranes can be due to pore constriction and irreversible fouling the gradual flux decline of the ppa bn can be attributed to the build up of a loose organic fouling layer over the membrane in the course of the experiment being more responsive to physical cleaning nevertheless this requires further investigation through running cyclic fouling cleaning experiments fig s3 in the supplementary material section exhibits the photographs of the fouled membranes at the termination of the long term filtration experiments fig s2 also shows that the rejection of the membranes to uv254 absorbing species were pretty stable with the ppa bn membrane showing the highest retention fig 4 b depicts the residual nom concentration in permeates from the ppa and ppa bn membranes in comparison to what is achieved using the commercial xn45 membrane or in the wb treatment plant it is obvious that the ppa bn membrane performs very well in removing nom from surface waters since it separates 650 and 341 more of uv254 and doc compared to the wb treatment plant although formation potential of dbps is a function of both concentration and characteristics of nom it has been reported that 1 mg of doc is capable of producing 100 μg of dbps which is beyond the global regulations 3 55 overall considering the filtration performance in terms of pure water flux nom removal and dbps formation potential and fouling resistance properties it can be concluded that the ppa bn membrane outperform the other treatment options investigated in the current study a complementary assessment of lc ocd and feem analyses has the potential to provide significant insights into the nom removal performance of selected water treatment processes the identification of specific nom components that present the greatest challenge to membrane performance is also valuable particularly for lab scale studies that seek to modify or optimize the implemented filtration process at pilot industrial scale the lc ocd profiles of the feed and wb treated samples as well as the permeates of the ppa 890 da ppa bn 978 da and xn45 500 da membranes are illustrated in fig 5 and the quantitative results on all fractions of these samples are listed in table s1 in the supplementary material section accordingly the feed is mainly composed of humic substances and lmw neutral compounds accounting for almost 45 and 37 of the overall nom respectively followed by building blocks and biopolymers at 12 and 6 in turn representing the first peak in the lc ocd chromatograms biopolymers in surface waters originate from algal matter and bacteria and account for a relatively small proportion of the overall nom they represent a fraction of organics with high molecular weights 20 kda and hydrophilicity including polysaccharides proteins and amino sugars 56 58 fig 5 shows that all membranes performed very well in separating biopolymers from water potentially through steric exclusion mechanism whereas wb treatment plant achieved 62 2 removal although removal of biopolymers from surface waters is not well studied in the literature siembida lösch et al reported 22 38 removal through coagulation flocculation sedimentation chain in a full scale drinking water treatment plant 57 the next peak in the lc ocd chromatograms is assigned to humic substances which are composed of humic acids and fulvic acids in varying amounts and possess a molecular weight of around 1 kda also the building blocks fraction which eludes from the size exclusion column after the humic substances consists of humics hydrolysates or breakdown products of humics in the molecular weight range of 300 500 da 56 these substances carry a high level of negative charge originating from the presence of ionized groups such as carboxylic and phenolic moieties in their structures and negatively charged membranes can remove them through charge repulsion mechanism in addition to steric exclusion 48 accordingly the ppa bn membrane removed more than 92 of humics and 94 of building blocks the xn45 membrane exhibited a lower retention at 87 and 92 for humics and building blocks in turn despite possessing a loser structure than the xn45 the better separation performance of the ppa bn membrane can be ascribed to its higher surface negative charge density enhancing the removal through charge repulsion mechanism referring to fig 5 and table s1 the wb treatment plant performed only moderately in removing these fractions from water as discussed earlier suva is an indicator of aromaticity and hydrophobicity of nom and since fulvic acids are more aliphatic and less aromatic than humic acids it can be suggested that the low suva value of the feed water indicates the dominance of fulvic acid type organics within the humics fraction 59 this will be further proved through feem studies also compared to humic acids fulvic acids are relatively hydrophilic and smaller in average molecular weight and possess higher oxygen and carboxylic acid content and therefore negative charge 60 as a result they are more recalcitrant to destabilization by coagulant dosages commonly applied in water treatment plants noteworthy is that insufficient removal of humic substances from drinking water is undesirable and detrimental to human health since these materials adversely affect the organoleptic quality of water serve as the precursors to the formation of carcinogenic dbps and exhibit ion exchange and complexing behavior towards toxic elements and micropollutants 61 referring to chromatograms in fig 5 lmw neutrals 350 da which are weakly charged hydrophilic to slightly hydrophobic organics such as lmw alcohols aldehydes ketones amino acids and sugars constituted the second largest fraction of nom accordingly the ppa and ppa bn membranes outperformed the commercial membrane in removing lmw neutrals from water at 74 and 83 respectively versus 38 for the xn45 compared with the ppa possessing a looser structure the lower rejection of the xn45 stems from its superhydrophilic surface allowing the passage of lmw neutrals through the thin film 49 the higher fouling propensity of the ppa can also play a role in its better rejection due to the development of a fouling layer which can obstruct nom pathways through the membrane 29 50 despite the recalcitrance of lmw compounds to removal by coagulation 62 it is apparent that a considerable amount of lmw neutral species at 78 were removed through the conventional chain in the wb treatment plant this substantial separation may be ascribed either to the presence of biopolymers in the feed water that can act as binding agents or flocculants aids to entrap the lmw substances 63 64 or to the effective adsorption of lmw organics onto the coagulated flocs 65 the eem contours of the feed and wb treated water samples as well as permeates of the ppa ppa bn and xn45 membranes are presented in fig s4 a to e according to chen et al eems were divided into five regions regions i ex em 220 270 nm 280 330 nm and ii ex em 220 270 nm 330 380 nm represent the fluorescence responses of tyrosine and tryptophan aromatic proteins respectively with regions iii ex em 220 270 nm 380 550 nm iv ex em 270 440 nm 280 380 nm and v ex em 270 440 nm 380 550 nm corresponding to fulvic acid like materials soluble microbial product smp like matter and humic acid like materials in turn 66 according to fig s4 a and in accordance with the lc ocd results and uv254 measurements fulvic acid like materials constituted a great proportion of the feed water showing the greatest fluorescence intensity in the region iii of the eem contour after treatment in wb treatment plant or through membranes an overall decrease in the fluorescence intensity of all samples can be observed as shown in fig s4 b through to e for instance the intensity of regions iii and v decreased in the order of ppa bn ppa xn45 wb treated sample which closely reflects on the similar trend of declining peak intensities for the humics and building blocks components in the lc ocd chromatograms however while lc ocd results indicated poor rejection of the materials identified as humic peak the feem profile showed a significant decline in the region defined as fulvic acid like material although humic and fulvic terms are sometimes changed interchangeably it is important to note that the two analytical tools used to quantify them have very different detection mechanisms and could lead to this apparent contradiction 67 a more detailed assessment of the exact size range and functional groups of this organic material would be required to offer a reasonable explanation for this discrepancy despite the membranes substantial removal of biopolymers as evidenced by the lc ocd profiles the aromatic protein like materials in the regions i and ii of feem contours were only partially removed the discrepancy in the removal of biopolymers obtained employing the two different characterization techniques may be attributed to the pre filtration of the feed water using the 0 45 μm ca filter it has been shown that pre filtration removes colloidal particulate protein like materials which can otherwise act as adsorption sites for smaller nom components 68 therefore in the absence of colloidal particulate proteins more small sized fluorophore containing proteins may pass through the membranes giving a rise to the fluorescence intensities in regions i and ii in fig s4 c through to e additionally reynolds has shown that protein like or tryptophan like fluorescence in surface waters is specifically related to the presence of free tryptophan which is a lmw amino acid being inclined to pass through the microstructure of membranes 69 therefore it can be suggested that the presence of protein breakdowns such as amino acids also detected as lc ocd lmw neutrals can lead to the residual fluorescence in the feem contours in accordance with lc ocd results where the ppa bn membrane performed better than the other counterparts in removing lmw neutral compounds fig s4 d shows the reduced fluorescence intensity of region iv for the ppa bn compared to those of the ppa and xn45 membranes in fig s4 c and e respectively region iv represents the existence of fluorescent substances of smp type that are products of bacterial activity in surface waters and may also enter the drinking water resources through municipal discharge 70 the precise definition of smp is open to debate but some fractions of smp have been identified as humic and fulvic acids proteins polysaccharides and amino acids 71 therefore it can be deduced that some fractions of smp can be categorized into lmw neutral compounds that are recalcitrant to removal by loose nf membranes as those fabricated employed in the current study overall due to the complex composition of nom a thorough characterization using lc ocd molecular size based and feem fluorophore composition based techniques is worthwhile to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the performance of selected processes in removing nom from a given source water this is vital since various nom fractions will affect the drinking water treatment issues such as membrane fouling or dbps formation in different manners 3 3 chlorine demand investigations aquasim software was used to simulate chlorine decay and estimate the parameters of the model using real experimental data obtained in the laboratory for the feed and wb treated water samples as well as the permeate of the ppa bn membrane 26 the rationale behind designing the chlorine demand studies was to first identify the optimum membrane in terms of flux nom rejection and fouling resistance behaviour through filtration experiments and then compare the chlorine demand of the optimum membrane s permeate with that of the conventionally treated water of the wb treatment plant this was supposed to provide a comparison between conventional and advanced methods in surface water treatment and nom removal fig 6 a and b show the real time data and the respective model fittings for the free and total chlorine decay in the feed water sample using the results obtained from parameter estimation the total chlorine demand of each water sample can be calculated as the sum of the chlorine equivalents of fra sra frn and srn components accordingly the total chlorine demand of feed wb treated and ppa bn permeate samples followed a decreasing trend and were calculated at 4 7 2 1 and 1 1 mg l 1 respectively these findings are in close agreement with the nom removal trends reported earlier in the manuscript where the ppa bn membrane appeared as the most effective in separating nom from water since nom is the major source of chlorine consumption in water through the reaction of cl2 with the suggested fra sra frn and srn components reduced chlorine demand of the ppa bn permeate reflects on the decreased content of organic matter reactive towards chlorine after membrane filtration as the formation potential of dbps is linked to the residual organic matter in water and presence of chlorine as the disinfectant it can be concluded that decreased nom concentration and the associated lower chlorine demand of the ppa bn permeate water will reduce the risk of dbps formation 72 73 therefore compared to the conventional treatment method employed in the wb treatment plant effective separation of nom from the feed water using the ppa bn membrane will not only benefit the economics of the treatment process due to 48 9 reduction in chlorine demand for disinfection but will also produce a healthier water complying with the drinking water regulations real time chlorine decay data and the associated aquasim model fittings for the wb treated and the ppa bn permeate water samples are provided in fig s5 in the supplementary material section 3 4 effect of the feed solution chemistry on nf performance and the resultant fouling the majority of nf membranes possess negatively charged surfaces to boost the separation properties and discourage the adsorption of foulants thus retarding the organic fouling phenomenon through imposing electrostatic repulsive forces towards organics nevertheless due to the dependence of the electrostatic properties of membranes upon solution ph as illustrated in fig 3 c acidic environments will shield the negative charges and diminish the repulsive forces towards organics 74 75 additionally nom is a mixture of predominantly negatively charged substances with their size and configuration being substantially associated with solution chemistry 76 according to the polyelectrolyte solution theory proposed by ghosh and schnitzer 77 nom exists as a rigid spherocolloid at low ph due to the decreased intramolecular repulsive forces among neighbouring functional groups resulting from the charge shielding effects and neutralization of carboxylic moieties therefore decreased size and negative charge of nom together with the reduced negative charge of the membranes will deteriorate the rejection under acidic conditions accordingly fig 7 a shows that the rejection of all membranes decreased when the solution ph was adjusted to 5 compared to those obtained at ph 7 as illustrated in fig 4 a among all the ppa membrane exhibited the most severe reductions at 12 7 and 17 2 in uv254 and doc respectively while the ppa bn membrane only exhibited 5 9 and 6 7 decrease in the same in turn among all the xn45 membrane exhibited the slightest difference in rejection at varying ph values of 7 and 5 similar results have been reported by hong and elimelech who investigated the physical and chemical aspects of nom fouling of nf membranes accordingly they monitored the rejection of suwannee river humic acid sha and aldrich humic acid aha at ph 4 and 8 and reported 89 versus 93 rejection which is a minor difference respectively for aha and 81 versus 94 rejection in turn for sha 78 therefore due to the complex nature of nom and different characteristics of nf membranes it would be difficult to predict or even compare the nom rejection in various nf operations as such verliefde and colleagues have observed almost no difference in rejection of lactic and malonic acids at varying ph values of 5 and 8 using a nf membrane despite both nom and the membrane being negatively charged while reporting a significant difference for formic and acetic acids under similar conditions they described this trend based on the molecular weight and degree of dissociation of the selected compounds 79 nevertheless this discussion may be limited when it comes to translation of nom rejection from real surface waters due to the wide range of organic substances being present in such systems for instance yang et al have reported zero difference in rejection of neutral organics under varying ph conditions of 3 5 near iep 5 5 and 7 5 despite the change that is expected to occur in the structure of nf90 and nf270 membranes under these solution chemistries 80 in the current study the feed is mainly composed of humic and neutral substances and while neutrals can exhibit a ph independent rejection humics may be of diverse molecular weights and dissociate to different degrees that can affect their rejection through various trends however as a more general observation it has been shown that all membranes exhibit lower nom rejection at lower ph further to diminishing the rejection acidic conditions also exacerbates the fouling propensity of membranes on the one hand reduced electrostatic repulsive forces between the membrane and nom can increase the accumulation rate of organics onto the surface and on the other hand the coiled and rigid conformation of nom can lead to the development of a denser gel layer onto the membrane 78 as such when the solution ph was reduced to 5 fig 7 a shows that the normalized flux values of the ppa and ppa bn membranes decreased to 66 and 84 respectively compared to 89 and 95 at ph 7 the commercial xn45 membrane also exhibited a moderate reduction to 80 calcium ions ca2 exist in varying amounts in surface water systems and have been found to significantly affect the organic fouling propensity of membranes according to the derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory presence of ca2 ions will decrease the electrostatic repulsive forces among the nom molecules through compressing the electrical double layer of organics leading to colloidal instability and thus intensifying nom aggregation near the surface 81 many studies have shown that ca2 ions can form complexes with the negatively charged functional groups mostly carboxylic of nom and membranes so acting as bridges near the surface firmly linking nom to the membrane and promoting foulant deposition and aggravating gel layer formation and organic fouling 76 82 84 similarly the current study confirmed the deteriorative effect of ca2 ions on membrane fouling as shown in fig 7 b the flux of all membranes decreased to some extent in the presence of 1 mm ca2 ions when compared with normal conditions presented in fig 4 a however the reductions were not as significant as those observed under acidic solution chemistry environment interestingly some researchers have reported decreased retarded organic fouling at ca2 concentrations higher than a critical value usually above 2 5 3 mm which was ascribed to the bulk complexation among ca2 ions and nom and the resulted reduction in the doc content of the feed 76 82 it is also expected that formation of larger aggregates under high ca2 concentrations improves the rejection 82 nevertheless since the current study employed a moderate concentration 1 mm shielded electrostatic repulsion among the membranes and nom species might have led to slightly lower rejection trends as depicted in fig 7 b compared with normal conditions overall it can be concluded that under solution chemistry conditions deteriorative for filtration applications the ppa bn membrane exhibited the most stable performance in nom separation and fouling resistance which can be ascribed to its additional surface negative charge imparted through the introduction of bn nh2 nanosheets the effect of the feed solution chemistry on the fouling behavior of membranes along with information on the type chemistry of foulants were evaluated by collecting and normalizing the atr ftir spectra of membranes after the filtration experiments and comparing the results with those of the virgin membranes as shown in fig 8 a c considering the ftir spectra of the fouled membranes it is evident that the characteristics bands of the virgin membranes are still visible suggesting the formation of a very thin fouling layer the broad bands at around 914 and 1040 cm 1 reflect on the coc and co ring vibrations from polysaccharides 85 these bands have a greater intensity in the presence of ca2 that can be ascribed to the bridging phenomenon among the membranes and the negatively charged polysaccharides 86 for the xn45 the band at 1040 cm 1 already exists in the spectrum of the virgin membrane which can originate from the presence of co stretching vibrations probably from its protective coating layer traces of in plane oh bending vibrations of alcohol and phenol functional group containing fractions of nom can be found in the spectra of fouled ppa and ppa bn membranes at 1375 cm 1 representing the presence of humic substances and most likely fulvic acid fractions in the foulant layer 87 notwithstanding the spectra of the fouled xn45 membrane is almost unaffected in this wavenumber which can be ascribed to its lower retention of humic substances as evidenced in the fig 5 eventually the broad band at 1534 cm 1 represents nh bending vibrations of amines and the co stretching vibrations of carboxylic acids and derivatives in the foulant layers of membranes appeared at 1727 cm 1 therefore it is concluded that the fouling substances were mostly of hydrophilic character attributable to polysaccharide and fulvic acid like organic matter resulting from the almost complete rejection of these substances by the membranes 4 conclusions a new tfn nf membrane is developed using a modified ip process to yield a ppa layer functionalized by bn nh2 nanosheets for enhanced surface water treatment and nom removal the ppa bn membrane exhibited 69 higher flux and better nom rejection than the control counterpart with comparable fouling resistance this performance enhancement was attributed to the improved membrane surface physicochemical properties in the presence of bn nh2 nanosheets such as increased hydrophilicity and negative charge these improvements also boosted the membrane performance under detrimental solution chemistry conditions of low ph and high ca2 concentration due to the complex composition of organics performance of membranes in rejecting different fractions of nom was thoroughly evaluated using lc ocd and feem techniques and it was revealed that besides the complete removal of biopolymers the ppa bn membrane performed better than the control counterparts in separating lmw organics from water noteworthy is that the complete biopolymer removal resulted in the dominance of the polysaccharide like substances in the fouling layer of membranes the greater nom removal achieved using the ppa bn membrane together with the lower chlorine demand of the permeate calculated through aquasim simulation demonstrated the superiority of the tfn membranes compared to

14102,nanofiltration nf is an attractive surface water treatment option for the enhanced removal of natural organic matter nom to comply with the regulations of potentially toxic disinfection by products dbps formation however organic fouling has remained an unresolved issue which makes the process less cost effective to address this problem the current study reports on the fabrication of a new thin film nanocomposite tfn membrane incorporated with and decorated by amine functionalized boron nitride bn nh2 nanosheets physicochemical investigations revealed 60 and 40 enhancement in hydrophilicity and negative charge density of the modified membranes respectively which translated into 69 improvement in flux as well as boosted nom removal and fouling resistance compared with control counterparts additionally the modified membranes exhibited a better filtration performance under detrimental solution chemistry conditions of low ph and high ca2 concentration liquid chromatography coupled with organic carbon detection lc ocd profiles and fluorescence excitation emission matrices feem demonstrated the capability of the modified membranes in removing humics and lower molecular sized compounds from water as opposed to moderate removals achieved in a conventional water treatment plant finally aquasim simulations showed the lower chlorine demand of the nf treated water which can reflect on its decreased dbps formation potential keywords thin film nanocomposite membrane boron nitride nanosheets bn nh2 natural organic matter removal fouling resistance aquasim simulation 1 introduction chlorine is the most widely used disinfectant in water treatment plants which provides an economical approach to prevent microbial contamination in the treated water however residual chlorine can react with natural organic matter nom which is ubiquitous in all surface waters and produce potentially carcinogenic disinfection by products dbps 1 considering drastic changes in surface water quality associated with rising nom concentrations conventional treatment processes can no longer guarantee sufficient nom removal which will increase the risk of the formation of dbps 2 the application of nanofiltration nf in surface water treatment is a promising strategy to comply with the strict drinking water guidelines in relation to dbps 3 the unique ability of nf to separate low molecular weight lmw organics has resulted in its recent rapid growth to replace conventional processes or to be integrated with them for surface water treatment 4 7 significant reductions of over 90 in chlorine demand of treated waters have also been reported for nf as opposed to 72 obtained for conventional treatment 8 the simultaneous increase in nom removal and decrease in chlorine demand achieved with nf can reduce the formation of dbps thus providing consumers with better water quality in spite of the aforementioned advantages organic fouling disrupts the sustained operation of the nf by reducing the permeation over time 9 10 organic fouling which originates from the attachment of nom onto the membrane surface is strongly affected by the feed solution chemistry for instance acidic ph conditions and high ca2 concentrations exacerbate the fouling by facilitating the chemisorption of nom onto the membrane surface leading to fast kinetics of dense cake layer formation 11 12 furthermore both ph and presence of cations have a fundamental influence on the molecular size and shape of nom species which can also affect the membrane separation efficiency 13 an effective approach to mitigate the fouling propensity and enhancing the separation efficiency is optimizing the physicochemical properties of the selective polypiperazine amide ppa layer of thin film composite tfc membranes this may be achieved by introducing nanomaterials during the interfacial polymerization ip process to enhance the hydrophilicity and negative charge density of the ppa film 14 application of nanomaterials within the thin film has progressed from conventional metal oxides to the state of the art nanoarchitectures like functionalized carbon nanotubes cnts graphene based nanoparticles metal organic frameworks mofs cellulose nanocrystals and zwitterionic nanomaterials 15 19 as new additions to the class of 2 dimentional 2d materials amine functionalized boron nitride bn nh2 nanosheets that are synthesized via a sustainable approach based on the ball milling of hexagonal bn and urea can also be employed as nanofillers during the ip process 20 chemical bonding between unreacted b atoms nh2 moieties at the edges of nanosheets and available acyl chloride groups of the ppa layer enhances their stability in the thin film which is advantageous in long term filtration operations additionally polarity of amine functional groups and their tendency to absorb water molecules through hydrogen bonding and electron deficiency of unreacted b atoms which make them prone to acquire hydroxyl ligands in water can boost the membrane surface hydrophilicity and negative charge density respectively thus mitigating the organic fouling of membranes 20 22 in spite of the aforementioned improvements in the materials and modification of membranes most research works to date have mainly focused on the implementation of thin film nanocomposite tfn membranes for desalination or employed limited model nom compounds to evaluate the membrane filtration performance 23 25 little is known regarding the efficiency of tfn membranes in dealing with different fractions of nom in real water bodies and the associated fouling phenomenon additionally there is merit in modifying the ip technique to fabricate thin films which exhibit the highest possible exposure and interaction of nanomaterials with foulants to address these shortcomings the current study focuses on the fabrication of a high flux loose tfn membrane modified with amine functionalized boron nitride bn nh2 nanosheets to exploit the ultimate potential of nanosheets and maximize the filtration efficiency ip process was tuned in a way to yield a double functionalized ppa film incorporated with and decorated by bn nh2 nanosheets physicochemical properties of the resultant membranes were carefully characterized and the nf performance was evaluated through cross flow filtration of a surface water with a moderate nom content experimental results were benchmarked by control membranes and the process efficiency in term of nom removal and permeate chlorine demand was also compared with that of a conventional drinking water treatment plant finally effects of solution chemistry on membranes filtration performance was investigated by varying ph and ca2 concentration and the nature of foulants was identified through spectroscopic studies on the fouled membranes 2 experimental section 2 1 chemicals and materials commercial trisep xn45 nf membrane 500 da was purchased from sterlitech polyethersulfone pes ultrafiltration uf membrane 50 kda was supplied by risingsun membrane technology and cellulose nitrite membrane 0 45 μm was obtained from microanalytix piperazine pip 99

used as received without further purification bn nh2 nanosheets were fabricated via a facile low cost and environmentally friendly one step exfoliation and functionalization approach concisely hexagonal bn and urea weight ratio 1 60 were ball milled together under nitrogen atmosphere and ambient temperature at 700 rpm for 20 h and the resultant exfoliated bn nh2 nanosheets were dialyzed in pure water for one week to remove unreacted urea and obtain stable aqueous dispersions of bn nh2 in water 20 the approximate size and thickness of few layered bn nh2 nanosheets are 100 200 and 1 5 5 nm respectively and detailed characterization results were reported in our previous studies 21 22 2 2 preparation of the membranes tfn membranes were fabricated following the ip reaction between aqueous 2 wt pip 2 wt tea and 2 wt csa in water and organic 0 1 wt tmc in n hexane solutions on the pes substrate a plate and frame assembly was used to hold the membrane in place while being contacted with aqueous and organic solutions for 2 and 1 min respectively the established ppa layer was then heat treated in an oven at 50 c for 5 min to evaporate the residual solvents and enhance the cross linking the boron nitride modified tfn membranes were fabricated following the same procedure except for 0 003 wt bn nh2 addition in the aqueous solution as well as post functionalization of the as prepared ppa layer with a solution of 0 003 wt bn nh2 in ipa for 3 min to obtain a homogenous dispersion of nanosheets the solutions were sonicated for 15 min under ambient conditions the resultant membranes hereinafter are referred to as ppa and ppa bn the commercial xn45 membrane was also used to further benchmark the filtration experiments noteworthy is that the xn45 is a ppa based membrane with a loose structure and a molecular weight cut off mwco value of 500 da which according to the manufacturer can be used for surface water treatment all membranes were kept in di water and stored at 4 c until use fig 1 shows the procedure used to fabricate tfn membranes in the current study 2 3 characterization of membranes physical and chemical surface properties of membranes were evaluated through microscopy and spectroscopy techniques micromorphology of the thin films was probed via field emission scanning electron microscopy fe sem on a supra 55 v p zeiss instrument at 5 kv

total reflectance fourier transform infrared atr ftir spectroscopy using a bruker vertex 70 ftir equipped with miracle single reflection atr accessory to obtain the spectra 32 scans were collected at wavenumbers 600 4000 cm 1 and a resolution of 4 cm 1 surface hydrophilicity of membranes were evaluated through contact angle ca measurements on a cam 101 contact angle surface tension measuring system ksv finland using a 3 μl di water droplet at 200 s equilibrium time streaming potential measurements using a surpass anton paar electro kinetic analyzer eka with a 1 mm nacl background electrolyte revealed the surface charge density of membranes under varying ph conditions which were adjusted by 0 1 m sodium hydroxide or hydrogen chloride solutions mwco value of membranes was evaluated by measuring the rejection of neutral solutes i e glucose maltose raffinose and α cyclodextrine at 6 bar where applicable measurements were performed on triplicate samples and average results were reported 2 4 sample collection surface water samples used in this study were collected from the wurdee boluc wb treatment plant situated in the geelong region state of victoria australia raw water to the treatment plant is sourced from the nearby wb reservoir samples of treated water were also collected from the treatment plant for comparison noteworthy is that wb treatment plant uses a conventional treatment chain composed of coagulation filtration disinfection and fluorination to treat water table 1 shows the characteristics of the raw and treated water samples collected from the treatment plant 2 5 design of nf experiments cross flow filtration experiments were conducted on a sterlitech cf042 module connected to a hydra cell pump to measure the permeation nom removal fouling resistance and long term operational performance of membranes a schematic diagram of nf setup used for the filtration experiments is presented in fig s1 in the supplementary material section membrane coupons were first compacted with di water at 8 bar for 150 min prior to pure water flux measurements at 6 bar according to eq 1 1 j v s t where j is the membrane flux in l m 2 h 1 v is the permeate volume in l collected in time t h and s is the membrane surface area in m2 filtration of the feed solution was conducted at 6 bar and room temperature and normalized flux as an indicator of membrane fouling propensity was calculated at the termination of the experiment according to eq 2 2 n o r m a l i z e d f l u x j t j 0 100 where jt is the flux at the termination of the experiment and j0 is the flux at the start of the filtration since all surface water samples were pre filtered using the 0 45 μm cn membranes prior to use biological organisms were not considered to be a significant part of the membrane fouling operational stability of membranes were evaluated through long term filtration experiments 52 h at 6 bar preceded by a 2 h compaction with di water at 8 bar to avoid nom decay feed reservoir was kept refrigerated at 4 c and concentrate stream was circulated in 44 m of stainless steel coils kept in a 0 8 c water bath before being recirculated to the feed reservoir 2 6 water quality analyses and characterization the treated water from the wb treatment plant along with the feed and permeate samples of the filtration experiments were evaluated for nom content through a variety of techniques doc was measured using a total organic carbon analyzer from shimadzu japan and uv254 was quantified employing a paro 300 spectrophotometer equipped with a quartz cuvette rejection values were then calculated according to eq 3 3 r c f c p c f 100 where r is the rejection in and cf and cp are the solute concentrations in the feed and permeate wb treated water samples respectively in mg l 1 for doc and cm 1 for uv254 performance of the membranes in removing different fractions of nom were investigated through size exclusion chromatography sec and fluorescence spectroscopy sec was performed on a model 8 liquid chromatography organic carbon detector lc ocd from doc labor germany samples were filtered using a pre rinsed 0 45 μm cellulose acetate filter before analysis a 2 ml injection volume was used for a retention time of 120 min in a single sec column with mobile phase at 1 1 ml min 1 the sec column separates nom species based on their hydrodynamic molecular size at varying retention times where smaller molecules have long retention times and larger molecules elute faster accordingly biopolymers and humic substances elute at 30 min t 45 min and 45 min t 59 min respectively while lmw acids and lmw neutral compounds elute at 59 min t 66 min and t 66 min in turn fluorescence excitation emission matrix feem of water samples was recorded on a carry eclipse varian usa spectrophotometer in the excitation range 220 420 nm and emission range 300 600 nm with the excitation and emission slits of 5 nm in order to remove the raman scattering and reducing the background noise fluorescence spectra of milli q water was obtained under similar conditions and subtracted from the samples spectra 2 7 application of aquasim software to model the chlorine decay upon disinfection in water treatment plants chlorine decay occurs in bulk waters due to the simultaneous reactions of chlorine with a variety of residual nom this process can be theoretically modelled to determine the chlorine demand of the feed and or the waters treated employing different treatment options allowing to evaluate the efficiency of selected process in reducing dbps formation potential 26 free chlorine cl2 dosed to the system can react with fast reducing agents fra fast reducing nitrogenous substances frn slow reducing agents sra and slow reducing nitrogenous substances srn a reaction scheme provided by jegatheesan et al suggested that the reaction between cl2 and fra sra will produce inert products and dbps and the reaction between cl2 and frn srn will generate inert products and combined chlorine cc where cc will be further converted into inert products the combination of cl2 and cc is translated into the total chlorine tc and it is the tc demand that determine the effectiveness of the treatment process in reducing dbps formation potential 8 a mathematical model that takes into account both the initial rapid decay and the continuing slow decay employing the following eqs 4 6 can be constructed in aquasim to determine the decay of cl2 and cc by performing parameter estimation and approximating the tc demand of the water 4 d c l 2

fra frn sra and srn respectively and k5 is the reaction rate of the conversion of cc to inert products to perform the experiments samples of feed wb treated and ppa bn permeate waters were used for chlorine decay evaluations briefly two 2 l batches of each sample were dosed with sodium hypochlorite to yield 2 and 4 mg l 1 of free chlorine and were kept in brown glass bottles to avoid the interfering effects of light the total and free chlorine concentrations were recorded immediately after sodium hypochlorite dosing and then at specific time intervals for a total of 168 h the chlorine measurements were conducted using a hach pocket colorimeter equipped with swiftest dpd reagent dispensers the measurement results were then used to obtain the aquasim model parameters and estimate the chlorine demand of the samples 2 8 effect of solution chemistry on nf performance in order to study the effect of solution chemistry on the nom rejection and fouling resistance properties of membranes filtration experiments were performed under two different conditions being a 6 bar pressure and ph 5 and b 6 bar pressure 1 mm ca2 and ph 7 ph values of the raw surface water were adjusted using 0 1 m hydrogen chloride or sodium hydroxide solutions and ca2 concentration was adjusted using calcium chloride at the termination of the experiments normalized flux values and nom rejection in terms of doc and uv254 were calculated using eqs 2 and 3 atr ftir was also employed to investigate the chemical structure of foulants deposited on the fouled membranes measurement were performed on triplicate samples to ensure the reproducibility of the results 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of membranes the as fabricated ppa and ppa bn as well as the commercial xn45 membranes were characterized physically and chemically to probe the determinative surface properties in relation to filtration performance as shown in the sem and afm images presented in fig 2 a d both ppa and ppa bn membranes exhibit a finely nodular background matrix signature of interfacially polymerized pip tmc networks referring to fig 2 a and c introduction of nanosheets during the modified ip process visibly changed the micromorphology of the surface to yield a thin film consisting of wrinkle shaped bulges and studded with bn nh2 nanosheets as indicated with the red circles in fig 2 c formation of these wrinkle shaped tufts is mainly ascribed to the interference of bn nh2 nanosheets with pip diffusion towards the interface of immiscible solutions during the ip process thus manipulating the reaction kinetics accordingly amine moieties and unreacted b atoms available at the edges of nanosheets can compete with pip to react with tmc and may result in ppa formation following multiple growth directions 27 28 further functionalization of the already formed bn nh2 incorporated pip tmc network with nanosheets will also result in the formation of covalent cb bonds between the unreacted acyl chlorides of tmc and electron deficient b atoms 21 therefore chemical bonding rather than physical blending can promise stable performance of the ppa bn membrane and will eliminate the possibility of nanosheet leaching out from the membrane surface during filtration practices 29 morphological observations made through sem images are consistent with the surface topography and roughness parameters obtained from the afm micrographs presented in fig 2 b and d as can be seen the bare ppa membrane possesses a smooth surface with an rq value of only 8 0 94 nm while the ppa bn membrane exhibits a slightly rougher surface at rq of 12 1 67 nm due to the formation of wrinkle shaped microarchitectures both membrane can be categorized as being extremely smooth compared with the literature data on similar types of tfn membranes 30 32 with regards to the xn45 membrane fig 2 e and f show that the membrane surface is firmly packed with evenly distributed globular nodules which are bigger in size and density compared to those of the ppa and ppa bn membranes therefore the xn45 membrane possesses a higher surface roughness while still being categorized as a smooth membrane high surface roughness is generally expected to enhance water permeability and deteriorate the membrane fouling at the same time as water flows from ridges to valleys the diffusion path length becomes shorter and the surface area available for the formation of a hydration layer expands which will result in an overall higher flow rate however the foulants may also be trapped and accumulate in the valleys deteriorating the fouling 17 25 nevertheless the ultimate fouling resistance property of a membrane is also dependent upon surface chemical characteristics and is therefore a function of both hydrophilicity and charge density in addition to roughness so it is of paramount importance to define the filtration performance and fouling behavior of membranes with respect to both physical and chemical properties of the thin films the chemical composition of the surface of membranes was investigated by atr ftir spectroscopy presented in fig 3 a as indicated with the orange shaded areas all membranes exhibit characteristic bands of a polysulfone substrate in the wavenumber ranges of 3060 3030 and or 1145 1100 cm 1 representing ch aromatic ring and symmetric so2 stretching vibration respectively 33 34 while the ppa and ppa bn membranes exhibit bands in both regions the xn45 commercial membrane possess strong bands only in the 1145 1100 cm 1 range and the signals are rather weak in the 3060 3030 cm 1 region traces of the ppa chemistry can also be clearly seen in the spectra of all membranes for instance the broad band at 3440 cm 1 corresponds to the nh and oh stretching the band at 1727 1663 cm 1 arise from the co stretching of amide group and the band appearing at 1441 cm 1 is related to the cn stretching and in plane nh deformation vibrations 32 34 also the signal of the band located at 1375 cm 1 grows in intensity for the ppa bn membrane which indicates the existence of more amine functional groups on the membrane surface after bn nh2 addition it is worth noting that the spectrum of the xn45 membrane also shows a band at 1375 cm 1 that may originate from the ch symmetric deformation of aliphatic carbon moieties of a preserving coating layer such as polyvinyl alcohol which is not usually revealed by the manufacturers this may be further confirmed by the additional bands at 3000 2900 cm 1 as well as the higher intensity of the band at 3440 cm 1 compared with other membranes proving the existence of additional oh groups arising from a coating layer 33 nevertheless the higher intensity of the 3440 cm 1 band can also be ascribed to the higher content of ppa on the surface of the xn45 membrane surface hydrophilicity is an important characteristic in controlling the fouling phenomenon and improving the permeation and rejection properties of membranes through changing the physical and chemical interactions of nom with the membrane surface 35 the surface hydrophilicity of the membranes was evaluated by ca measurements and presented in fig 3 b the recorded ca values descended from 32 1 8 for the ppa membrane to 9 0 9 for the xn45 exhibiting the super hydrophilic behavior of the thin films also double functionalization of the ppa layer with bn nh2 nanosheets improved the hydrophilic character of the membrane due to the polarity of amine functional groups and their tendency to absorb water molecules through hydrogen bonding 27 36 as a results the ppa bn membrane possessed a ca of 20 1 9 showing 60 greater hydrophilicity than the control ppa counterpart streaming potential measurements were conducted to investigate the surface charge properties of the membranes under varying solution ph conditions the existence of carboxyl and amine functional groups in the structure of ppa films affect the material charge typically leading to more negatively charged films for high carboxylic contents membranes possess positive charge under acidic conditions due to the protonation of amine moieties and hold negative charge with increasing ph above their isoelectric point iep due to the dissociation of carboxylic groups 37 as seen in fig 3 c presence of bn nh2 nanosheets inside and above the ppa film enhanced the membrane surface negative charge density significantly so that at ph 7 the streaming potential value of the ppa bn membrane at 70 mv was 40 greater than that of the ppa at 50 mv this improvement can be attributed to the lewis acidity of electron deficient b atoms available at the edges of nanosheets and their tendency to acquire hydroxyl ligands 38 39 our previous studies have also shown that tfn membranes incorporated with or decorated by bn nh2 where the nanosheets are either within the ppa layer or above it possessed greater negative charge density compared with the control counterpart 21 22 eventually neutral solute rejection and mwco of fabricated membranes were estimated through filtration of glucose maltose raffinose and α cyclodextrin according to the literature mwco is referred to the molecular weight of a neutral solute 90 of which is rejected by the membrane 40 fig 3 d presents that the rejection figures of both ppa and ppa bn membranes to neutral solutes with different molecular weights ranging from 180 16 to 972 84 g mol 1 followed a linear trend upon fitting the data the mwco values of the ppa and ppa bn membranes were estimated at 890 and 978 da respectively these values stand well within the range reported for loose nf membranes derived from the polycondensation reaction between pip and tmc which yields a semi aromatic and partially cross linked network 41 compared to the control ppa membrane the increased mwco of the ppa bn membrane can be ascribed to the formation of nanogaps due to the interfering effect of nanosheets in the ip process yielding a thin film with lower degree of cross linking indeed formation of the nanogaps between nanosheets and polymeric matrix may result in the generation of wider pathways for the transport of solutes through the microstructure of the thin film 35 although separation performance of charged nf membranes is based on charge interaction and size exclusion sieving effects mechanisms considering the neutral nature of the model solutes only sieving mechanism was responsible for the rejection performance of the membranes and as a result rejection decreased with increasing the membrane free volume 42 3 2 effect of bn nh2 nanosheets on the filtration performance of membranes results of the filtration performance of the membranes including pure water flux nom rejection and normalized flux after 6 h filtration at 6 bar ph 7 and ambient temperature conditions are presented in fig 4 a accordingly the pure water flux of the ppa membrane is 43 2 l m 2 h 1 which increases by almost 69 to 72 9 l m 2 h 1 after the introduction of bn nh2 nanosheets during the ip process as discussed in the previous section the ppa bn membrane possesses more free volume under the effect of nanogaps formed in the presence of bn nh2 nanosheets compared to the ppa counterpart which results in the generation of higher water flux through the membrane also greater hydrophilicity and surface roughness of the ppa bn enhance the wettability characteristics of the membrane and facilitate the mobility of water molecules through the thin film the pure water flux of the xn45 membrane is lower than that of the ppa bn at 50 4 0 51 l m 2 h 1 which can be ascribed to its tighter structure mwco 500 da accommodating lower flow of water nevertheless when compared with the ppa counterpart possessing a looser network mwco 890 da it can be deduced that greater surface roughness and hydrophilicity of the xn45 membrane played a major role in enhancing the flux in this regard boussu et al have also shown that despite its tighter structure the desal51hl 190 da membrane yielded a higher water permeance at 11 4 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 compared with 5 7 and 3 8 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 for ntr7450 310 and n30 f 680 respectively that can originate from its higher hydrophilicity and surface roughness 43 referring to the data in the table 1 on the characteristics of the raw surface water used as the feed in this study the specific uv absorbance suva value can be calculated at 1 2 l mg 1 m 1 the suva has been shown to strongly correlate with the hydrophobic organic acid fraction of nom and is a useful approximation of nom aromaticity and molecular weight 44 46 therefore the suva value obtained for the feed water indicates that organic species are of low aromaticity and molecular weight hence it is expected that the tightest membrane xn45 exhibits the greatest nom removal as long as steric exclusion mechanism is concerned nevertheless fig 4 a shows that the rejection of nom in terms of uv254 and doc increases in the order of xn45 500 da ppa 890 da ppa bn 978 da quantitatively the ppa and ppa bn membranes fabricated in this study supported the removal of more than 90 of nom expressed as uv254 and 83 3 and 89 respectively in terms of doc whereas the xn45 removed around 87 and 71 of uv254 and doc in turn since nom is predominantly composed of negatively charged species 47 the low rejection figure for xn45 can be attributed to its lower surface negative charge density compared to that of the ppa bn reducing the extent of charge repulsions between nom and the membrane surface 48 therefore it can be concluded that charge interactions play a more significant role than steric exclusion in controlling the removal of nom using membranes other research groups have also delivered similar conclusion among which song et al have shown that a negatively charged uf membrane with a mwco of 100 kda can separate more nom at 84 7 than a neutral but tighter counterpart with a mwco of 30 kda at 68 9 they have further claimed that charge modified uf membranes can be potential substitutes for nf membranes in nom removal applications 48 despite carrying a higher surface negative charge density compared to the ppa membrane the lower rejection of the xn45 may also originate from its superhydrophilic surface facilitating the passage of hydrophilic nom through the thin film microstructure 49 accordingly the xn45 membrane possesses a more hydrophilic surface than the ppa and since the nom used in the current study is also of hydrophilic nature as confirmed by suva measurements it can be deduced that the xn45 membrane can facilitate the passage of organics specifically the low molecular weight neutral compounds that are abundant in the feed solution through its nanoporous network this can be confirmed by referring to the uv254 rejection values where both membrane exhibited similar removal efficiency for larger more aromatic and hydrophobic compounds therefore it can be deduced that smaller and more hydrophilic organics were responsible for the lower nom removal in terms of doc of the xn45 membrane furthermore the surface of the ppa membrane has lower hydrophilicity and negative charge density than that of the xn45 which results in its higher fouling the fouling layer formed above the ppa surface can act as an additional barrier towards the passage of nom and results in higher rejection figures for this membrane also aggregation of the negatively charged foulants on the membrane can enhance the negative charge density of the ppa further repelling the organics away from the surface 29 50 overall due to the complexity of nom composition and its physicochemical interactions with the membrane surface different factors can affect nom retention to varied extents briefly characterization of some other australian surface water resources has shown great variations across the nom concentration and aromaticity with reported doc and suva values ranging from 5 2 mg l 1 and 2 5 l mg 1 m 1 for the moondarra reservoir in victoria to 12 8 mg l 1 and 3 6 l mg 1 m 1 for myponga reservoir in south australia 51 the fouling resistance properties of membranes were also evaluated at the termination of the filtration experiments through measurements of the normalized flux and results are presented in fig 4 a compared to the ppa membrane the ppa bn maintained a greater extent of the initial flux at 95 after 6 h which is due to the improved hydrophilicity and negative charge density of its surface enhanced wettability and the facilitated development of a water hydration layer over the surface together with the improved electrostatic repulsive forces in the presence of bn nh2 nanosheets helped keeping nom away from the membrane surface thus mitigating the organic fouling phenomenon 48 the longevity and operational stability of membranes were assessed through long term 52 h filtration studies results of which are presented in fig s2 in the supplementary material section all membranes underwent reductions in the initial flux to varying extents with the ppa membrane exhibiting the greatest decline to 54 compared to 80 for the ppa bn also in the case of the ppa and xn45 membranes a significant proportion of the flux reduction occurred during the first hours 0 8 h of the filtration experiments in contrast the ppa bn counterpart showed the most stable performance at the beginning and throughout the 52 h filtration which can be ascribed to its desirable surface properties in terms of charge and hydrophilicity li and elimelech have shown that the fouling process at the early stage is controlled by the interactions between the foulants and the clean membrane surface and therefore the interaction forces determine the initial rate of fouling 52 also according to fane and chang membrane fouling in loose nf membranes is dominated by the pore constriction mechanism during the initial stage of the fouling process that can lead to irreversible entrapment of foulants inside the thin film 53 taken together it can be suggested that the greater initial fouling can result in the more severe irreversible fouling of membranes that require intermittent chemical cleaning for the partial complete recovery of the initial flux 54 in the current study both ppa and xn45 membranes underwent severe initial fouling in the first two hours of the filtration whereas the ppa bn membrane exhibited a more stable behaviour at the beginning and throughout the experiment while the rapid flux decline of the ppa and xn45 membranes can be due to pore constriction and irreversible fouling the gradual flux decline of the ppa bn can be attributed to the build up of a loose organic fouling layer over the membrane in the course of the experiment being more responsive to physical cleaning nevertheless this requires further investigation through running cyclic fouling cleaning experiments fig s3 in the supplementary material section exhibits the photographs of the fouled membranes at the termination of the long term filtration experiments fig s2 also shows that the rejection of the membranes to uv254 absorbing species were pretty stable with the ppa bn membrane showing the highest retention fig 4 b depicts the residual nom concentration in permeates from the ppa and ppa bn membranes in comparison to what is achieved using the commercial xn45 membrane or in the wb treatment plant it is obvious that the ppa bn membrane performs very well in removing nom from surface waters since it separates 650 and 341 more of uv254 and doc compared to the wb treatment plant although formation potential of dbps is a function of both concentration and characteristics of nom it has been reported that 1 mg of doc is capable of producing 100 μg of dbps which is beyond the global regulations 3 55 overall considering the filtration performance in terms of pure water flux nom removal and dbps formation potential and fouling resistance properties it can be concluded that the ppa bn membrane outperform the other treatment options investigated in the current study a complementary assessment of lc ocd and feem analyses has the potential to provide significant insights into the nom removal performance of selected water treatment processes the identification of specific nom components that present the greatest challenge to membrane performance is also valuable particularly for lab scale studies that seek to modify or optimize the implemented filtration process at pilot industrial scale the lc ocd profiles of the feed and wb treated samples as well as the permeates of the ppa 890 da ppa bn 978 da and xn45 500 da membranes are illustrated in fig 5 and the quantitative results on all fractions of these samples are listed in table s1 in the supplementary material section accordingly the feed is mainly composed of humic substances and lmw neutral compounds accounting for almost 45 and 37 of the overall nom respectively followed by building blocks and biopolymers at 12 and 6 in turn representing the first peak in the lc ocd chromatograms biopolymers in surface waters originate from algal matter and bacteria and account for a relatively small proportion of the overall nom they represent a fraction of organics with high molecular weights 20 kda and hydrophilicity including polysaccharides proteins and amino sugars 56 58 fig 5 shows that all membranes performed very well in separating biopolymers from water potentially through steric exclusion mechanism whereas wb treatment plant achieved 62 2 removal although removal of biopolymers from surface waters is not well studied in the literature siembida lösch et al reported 22 38 removal through coagulation flocculation sedimentation chain in a full scale drinking water treatment plant 57 the next peak in the lc ocd chromatograms is assigned to humic substances which are composed of humic acids and fulvic acids in varying amounts and possess a molecular weight of around 1 kda also the building blocks fraction which eludes from the size exclusion column after the humic substances consists of humics hydrolysates or breakdown products of humics in the molecular weight range of 300 500 da 56 these substances carry a high level of negative charge originating from the presence of ionized groups such as carboxylic and phenolic moieties in their structures and negatively charged membranes can remove them through charge repulsion mechanism in addition to steric exclusion 48 accordingly the ppa bn membrane removed more than 92 of humics and 94 of building blocks the xn45 membrane exhibited a lower retention at 87 and 92 for humics and building blocks in turn despite possessing a loser structure than the xn45 the better separation performance of the ppa bn membrane can be ascribed to its higher surface negative charge density enhancing the removal through charge repulsion mechanism referring to fig 5 and table s1 the wb treatment plant performed only moderately in removing these fractions from water as discussed earlier suva is an indicator of aromaticity and hydrophobicity of nom and since fulvic acids are more aliphatic and less aromatic than humic acids it can be suggested that the low suva value of the feed water indicates the dominance of fulvic acid type organics within the humics fraction 59 this will be further proved through feem studies also compared to humic acids fulvic acids are relatively hydrophilic and smaller in average molecular weight and possess higher oxygen and carboxylic acid content and therefore negative charge 60 as a result they are more recalcitrant to destabilization by coagulant dosages commonly applied in water treatment plants noteworthy is that insufficient removal of humic substances from drinking water is undesirable and detrimental to human health since these materials adversely affect the organoleptic quality of water serve as the precursors to the formation of carcinogenic dbps and exhibit ion exchange and complexing behavior towards toxic elements and micropollutants 61 referring to chromatograms in fig 5 lmw neutrals 350 da which are weakly charged hydrophilic to slightly hydrophobic organics such as lmw alcohols aldehydes ketones amino acids and sugars constituted the second largest fraction of nom accordingly the ppa and ppa bn membranes outperformed the commercial membrane in removing lmw neutrals from water at 74 and 83 respectively versus 38 for the xn45 compared with the ppa possessing a looser structure the lower rejection of the xn45 stems from its superhydrophilic surface allowing the passage of lmw neutrals through the thin film 49 the higher fouling propensity of the ppa can also play a role in its better rejection due to the development of a fouling layer which can obstruct nom pathways through the membrane 29 50 despite the recalcitrance of lmw compounds to removal by coagulation 62 it is apparent that a considerable amount of lmw neutral species at 78 were removed through the conventional chain in the wb treatment plant this substantial separation may be ascribed either to the presence of biopolymers in the feed water that can act as binding agents or flocculants aids to entrap the lmw substances 63 64 or to the effective adsorption of lmw organics onto the coagulated flocs 65 the eem contours of the feed and wb treated water samples as well as permeates of the ppa ppa bn and xn45 membranes are presented in fig s4 a to e according to chen et al eems were divided into five regions regions i ex em 220 270 nm 280 330 nm and ii ex em 220 270 nm 330 380 nm represent the fluorescence responses of tyrosine and tryptophan aromatic proteins respectively with regions iii ex em 220 270 nm 380 550 nm iv ex em 270 440 nm 280 380 nm and v ex em 270 440 nm 380 550 nm corresponding to fulvic acid like materials soluble microbial product smp like matter and humic acid like materials in turn 66 according to fig s4 a and in accordance with the lc ocd results and uv254 measurements fulvic acid like materials constituted a great proportion of the feed water showing the greatest fluorescence intensity in the region iii of the eem contour after treatment in wb treatment plant or through membranes an overall decrease in the fluorescence intensity of all samples can be observed as shown in fig s4 b through to e for instance the intensity of regions iii and v decreased in the order of ppa bn ppa xn45 wb treated sample which closely reflects on the similar trend of declining peak intensities for the humics and building blocks components in the lc ocd chromatograms however while lc ocd results indicated poor rejection of the materials identified as humic peak the feem profile showed a significant decline in the region defined as fulvic acid like material although humic and fulvic terms are sometimes changed interchangeably it is important to note that the two analytical tools used to quantify them have very different detection mechanisms and could lead to this apparent contradiction 67 a more detailed assessment of the exact size range and functional groups of this organic material would be required to offer a reasonable explanation for this discrepancy despite the membranes substantial removal of biopolymers as evidenced by the lc ocd profiles the aromatic protein like materials in the regions i and ii of feem contours were only partially removed the discrepancy in the removal of biopolymers obtained employing the two different characterization techniques may be attributed to the pre filtration of the feed water using the 0 45 μm ca filter it has been shown that pre filtration removes colloidal particulate protein like materials which can otherwise act as adsorption sites for smaller nom components 68 therefore in the absence of colloidal particulate proteins more small sized fluorophore containing proteins may pass through the membranes giving a rise to the fluorescence intensities in regions i and ii in fig s4 c through to e additionally reynolds has shown that protein like or tryptophan like fluorescence in surface waters is specifically related to the presence of free tryptophan which is a lmw amino acid being inclined to pass through the microstructure of membranes 69 therefore it can be suggested that the presence of protein breakdowns such as amino acids also detected as lc ocd lmw neutrals can lead to the residual fluorescence in the feem contours in accordance with lc ocd results where the ppa bn membrane performed better than the other counterparts in removing lmw neutral compounds fig s4 d shows the reduced fluorescence intensity of region iv for the ppa bn compared to those of the ppa and xn45 membranes in fig s4 c and e respectively region iv represents the existence of fluorescent substances of smp type that are products of bacterial activity in surface waters and may also enter the drinking water resources through municipal discharge 70 the precise definition of smp is open to debate but some fractions of smp have been identified as humic and fulvic acids proteins polysaccharides and amino acids 71 therefore it can be deduced that some fractions of smp can be categorized into lmw neutral compounds that are recalcitrant to removal by loose nf membranes as those fabricated employed in the current study overall due to the complex composition of nom a thorough characterization using lc ocd molecular size based and feem fluorophore composition based techniques is worthwhile to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the performance of selected processes in removing nom from a given source water this is vital since various nom fractions will affect the drinking water treatment issues such as membrane fouling or dbps formation in different manners 3 3 chlorine demand investigations aquasim software was used to simulate chlorine decay and estimate the parameters of the model using real experimental data obtained in the laboratory for the feed and wb treated water samples as well as the permeate of the ppa bn membrane 26 the rationale behind designing the chlorine demand studies was to first identify the optimum membrane in terms of flux nom rejection and fouling resistance behaviour through filtration experiments and then compare the chlorine demand of the optimum membrane s permeate with that of the conventionally treated water of the wb treatment plant this was supposed to provide a comparison between conventional and advanced methods in surface water treatment and nom removal fig 6 a and b show the real time data and the respective model fittings for the free and total chlorine decay in the feed water sample using the results obtained from parameter estimation the total chlorine demand of each water sample can be calculated as the sum of the chlorine equivalents of fra sra frn and srn components accordingly the total chlorine demand of feed wb treated and ppa bn permeate samples followed a decreasing trend and were calculated at 4 7 2 1 and 1 1 mg l 1 respectively these findings are in close agreement with the nom removal trends reported earlier in the manuscript where the ppa bn membrane appeared as the most effective in separating nom from water since nom is the major source of chlorine consumption in water through the reaction of cl2 with the suggested fra sra frn and srn components reduced chlorine demand of the ppa bn permeate reflects on the decreased content of organic matter reactive towards chlorine after membrane filtration as the formation potential of dbps is linked to the residual organic matter in water and presence of chlorine as the disinfectant it can be concluded that decreased nom concentration and the associated lower chlorine demand of the ppa bn permeate water will reduce the risk of dbps formation 72 73 therefore compared to the conventional treatment method employed in the wb treatment plant effective separation of nom from the feed water using the ppa bn membrane will not only benefit the economics of the treatment process due to 48 9 reduction in chlorine demand for disinfection but will also produce a healthier water complying with the drinking water regulations real time chlorine decay data and the associated aquasim model fittings for the wb treated and the ppa bn permeate water samples are provided in fig s5 in the supplementary material section 3 4 effect of the feed solution chemistry on nf performance and the resultant fouling the majority of nf membranes possess negatively charged surfaces to boost the separation properties and discourage the adsorption of foulants thus retarding the organic fouling phenomenon through imposing electrostatic repulsive forces towards organics nevertheless due to the dependence of the electrostatic properties of membranes upon solution ph as illustrated in fig 3 c acidic environments will shield the negative charges and diminish the repulsive forces towards organics 74 75 additionally nom is a mixture of predominantly negatively charged substances with their size and configuration being substantially associated with solution chemistry 76 according to the polyelectrolyte solution theory proposed by ghosh and schnitzer 77 nom exists as a rigid spherocolloid at low ph due to the decreased intramolecular repulsive forces among neighbouring functional groups resulting from the charge shielding effects and neutralization of carboxylic moieties therefore decreased size and negative charge of nom together with the reduced negative charge of the membranes will deteriorate the rejection under acidic conditions accordingly fig 7 a shows that the rejection of all membranes decreased when the solution ph was adjusted to 5 compared to those obtained at ph 7 as illustrated in fig 4 a among all the ppa membrane exhibited the most severe reductions at 12 7 and 17 2 in uv254 and doc respectively while the ppa bn membrane only exhibited 5 9 and 6 7 decrease in the same in turn among all the xn45 membrane exhibited the slightest difference in rejection at varying ph values of 7 and 5 similar results have been reported by hong and elimelech who investigated the physical and chemical aspects of nom fouling of nf membranes accordingly they monitored the rejection of suwannee river humic acid sha and aldrich humic acid aha at ph 4 and 8 and reported 89 versus 93 rejection which is a minor difference respectively for aha and 81 versus 94 rejection in turn for sha 78 therefore due to the complex nature of nom and different characteristics of nf membranes it would be difficult to predict or even compare the nom rejection in various nf operations as such verliefde and colleagues have observed almost no difference in rejection of lactic and malonic acids at varying ph values of 5 and 8 using a nf membrane despite both nom and the membrane being negatively charged while reporting a significant difference for formic and acetic acids under similar conditions they described this trend based on the molecular weight and degree of dissociation of the selected compounds 79 nevertheless this discussion may be limited when it comes to translation of nom rejection from real surface waters due to the wide range of organic substances being present in such systems for instance yang et al have reported zero difference in rejection of neutral organics under varying ph conditions of 3 5 near iep 5 5 and 7 5 despite the change that is expected to occur in the structure of nf90 and nf270 membranes under these solution chemistries 80 in the current study the feed is mainly composed of humic and neutral substances and while neutrals can exhibit a ph independent rejection humics may be of diverse molecular weights and dissociate to different degrees that can affect their rejection through various trends however as a more general observation it has been shown that all membranes exhibit lower nom rejection at lower ph further to diminishing the rejection acidic conditions also exacerbates the fouling propensity of membranes on the one hand reduced electrostatic repulsive forces between the membrane and nom can increase the accumulation rate of organics onto the surface and on the other hand the coiled and rigid conformation of nom can lead to the development of a denser gel layer onto the membrane 78 as such when the solution ph was reduced to 5 fig 7 a shows that the normalized flux values of the ppa and ppa bn membranes decreased to 66 and 84 respectively compared to 89 and 95 at ph 7 the commercial xn45 membrane also exhibited a moderate reduction to 80 calcium ions ca2 exist in varying amounts in surface water systems and have been found to significantly affect the organic fouling propensity of membranes according to the derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory presence of ca2 ions will decrease the electrostatic repulsive forces among the nom molecules through compressing the electrical double layer of organics leading to colloidal instability and thus intensifying nom aggregation near the surface 81 many studies have shown that ca2 ions can form complexes with the negatively charged functional groups mostly carboxylic of nom and membranes so acting as bridges near the surface firmly linking nom to the membrane and promoting foulant deposition and aggravating gel layer formation and organic fouling 76 82 84 similarly the current study confirmed the deteriorative effect of ca2 ions on membrane fouling as shown in fig 7 b the flux of all membranes decreased to some extent in the presence of 1 mm ca2 ions when compared with normal conditions presented in fig 4 a however the reductions were not as significant as those observed under acidic solution chemistry environment interestingly some researchers have reported decreased retarded organic fouling at ca2 concentrations higher than a critical value usually above 2 5 3 mm which was ascribed to the bulk complexation among ca2 ions and nom and the resulted reduction in the doc content of the feed 76 82 it is also expected that formation of larger aggregates under high ca2 concentrations improves the rejection 82 nevertheless since the current study employed a moderate concentration 1 mm shielded electrostatic repulsion among the membranes and nom species might have led to slightly lower rejection trends as depicted in fig 7 b compared with normal conditions overall it can be concluded that under solution chemistry conditions deteriorative for filtration applications the ppa bn membrane exhibited the most stable performance in nom separation and fouling resistance which can be ascribed to its additional surface negative charge imparted through the introduction of bn nh2 nanosheets the effect of the feed solution chemistry on the fouling behavior of membranes along with information on the type chemistry of foulants were evaluated by collecting and normalizing the atr ftir spectra of membranes after the filtration experiments and comparing the results with those of the virgin membranes as shown in fig 8 a c considering the ftir spectra of the fouled membranes it is evident that the characteristics bands of the virgin membranes are still visible suggesting the formation of a very thin fouling layer the broad bands at around 914 and 1040 cm 1 reflect on the coc and co ring vibrations from polysaccharides 85 these bands have a greater intensity in the presence of ca2 that can be ascribed to the bridging phenomenon among the membranes and the negatively charged polysaccharides 86 for the xn45 the band at 1040 cm 1 already exists in the spectrum of the virgin membrane which can originate from the presence of co stretching vibrations probably from its protective coating layer traces of in plane oh bending vibrations of alcohol and phenol functional group containing fractions of nom can be found in the spectra of fouled ppa and ppa bn membranes at 1375 cm 1 representing the presence of humic substances and most likely fulvic acid fractions in the foulant layer 87 notwithstanding the spectra of the fouled xn45 membrane is almost unaffected in this wavenumber which can be ascribed to its lower retention of humic substances as evidenced in the fig 5 eventually the broad band at 1534 cm 1 represents nh bending vibrations of amines and the co stretching vibrations of carboxylic acids and derivatives in the foulant layers of membranes appeared at 1727 cm 1 therefore it is concluded that the fouling substances were mostly of hydrophilic character attributable to polysaccharide and fulvic acid like organic matter resulting from the almost complete rejection of these substances by the membranes 4 conclusions a new tfn nf membrane is developed using a modified ip process to yield a ppa layer functionalized by bn nh2 nanosheets for enhanced surface water treatment and nom removal the ppa bn membrane exhibited 69 higher flux and better nom rejection than the control counterpart with comparable fouling resistance this performance enhancement was attributed to the improved membrane surface physicochemical properties in the presence of bn nh2 nanosheets such as increased hydrophilicity and negative charge these improvements also boosted the membrane performance under detrimental solution chemistry conditions of low ph and high ca2 concentration due to the complex composition of organics performance of membranes in rejecting different fractions of nom was thoroughly evaluated using lc ocd and feem techniques and it was revealed that besides the complete removal of biopolymers the ppa bn membrane performed better than the control counterparts in separating lmw organics from water noteworthy is that the complete biopolymer removal resulted in the dominance of the polysaccharide like substances in the fouling layer of membranes the greater nom removal achieved using the ppa bn membrane together with the lower chlorine demand of the permeate calculated through aquasim simulation demonstrated the superiority of the tfn membranes compared to the conventional treatment employed in the wb treatment plant in tackling the increasingly concerning nom issue and decreasing the risk of dbps formation declaration of competing interest the authors

14103,literature frequently reports that colloids in aqueous matrices sorb a large fraction of pharmaceuticals since coagulation flocculation removes colloids it is expected that coagulation flocculation in principle should be useful in concentrating pharmaceuticals in wastewater treatment which would facilitate the treatment of these refractory compounds in our present work we researched the potential of coagulation flocculation for removing pharmaceuticals from raw sewage results from jar tests showed that pharmaceuticals are hardly removed from sewage with coagulation flocculation to investigate the discrepancy between reported colloidal sorption and the lack of removal when removing colloids we tested a commonly applied experimental setup which makes use of ultra filtration uf for determining the colloidal sorption of pharmaceuticals the uf method under research was compared with an assessment making use of flocculation both methods uf and flocculation showed similar removal of colloids however during uf the retention of pharmaceuticals reached values up to 93 4 in contrast when removing the colloids with flocculation no pharmaceutical removal was observed these results confirm that it is very likely to introduce an analysis bias in using uf membranes in the determination of colloidal sorption of pharmaceuticals in fact results predict an over estimation caused by a direct retention of pharmaceuticals without any binding to colloidal matter overall results of the current work show that pharmaceuticals hardly sorb to colloids and herewith the absence of removal of pharmaceuticals during coagulation flocculation is explained keywords pharmaceutical filtration sorption wastewater colloids 1 introduction in general pharmaceuticals consumed by humans are subsequently transferred into the sewer through human excreta since pharmaceuticals in many cases are recalcitrant towards biological degradation sewage treatment plants stps often do not completely remove these pharmaceutical compounds 1 2 therefore the main source of pharmaceuticals in surface waters is often stp effluent discharge 3 although the pharmaceutical concentrations in these discharges are low ng l to μg l 1 4 8 enhanced removal is necessary in order to prevent adverse effects on ecology and accumulation in the aquatic environment especially when considering an increase in pharmaceutical consumption in europe is observed over time 9 1 1 mechanisms of removal of organic micro pollutants with coagulation flocculation treatment of organic micro pollutants omps in low concentrations such as pharmaceuticals is challenging hence current practice of treatment in common stps is not sufficient yet 7 10 11 a feasible strategy to enhance the treatment effectiveness might be to concentrate omps in the sludge stream prior to super critical sludge gasification the research platform of the dutch water authorities showed that supercritical gasification of sewage sludge is potentially a feasible option for future stps 12 and this treatment would likely destroy all pharmaceutical molecules in relatively clean water such as drinking water or ultra pure water the removal of pharmaceuticals by coagulation flocculation is very poor 13 16 however adding organic matter before coagulation flocculation can increase the pharmaceutical removal significantly 16 in wastewaters rich in organic compounds such as sewage omp removal up to 80 is observed using coagulation flocculation 4 17 choi et al 18 showed that antibiotics are removed to approximately 50 from river water applying poly aluminium chloride these results indicate that the presence of organic matter may enhance the removal of pharmaceuticals during coagulation flocculation coagulation flocculation comprises of two different processes 19 1 the tendency for suspended matter to form larger aggregates promoted by altered surface properties and 2 the removal of dissolved matter by precipitation to our knowledge precipitation of pharmaceuticals in wastewater as a mean of removal has not been reported in literature therefore if removal of pharmaceuticals due to coagulants flocculants is observed the responsible removal mechanism is likely linked to the removal of suspended matter that acts as a vehicle for pharmaceuticals this would imply that there is a relation between sorption of pharmaceuticals to suspended matter expressed by the adsorption desorption distribution coefficient kd l kg and their removal efficiencies by coagulation flocculation this hypothesis is supported by results of carballa et al 4 suarez et al 17 and ruan et al 1 that show that coagulation in raw sewage yields a more or less linear relationship between removal efficiencies and log kd values of omps fig 1 the higher the sorption the higher the removal efficiency in addition the observation is made that pharmaceuticals in milliq water so without solids are hardly removed by coagulation 16 1 2 plain sorption mechanism the pharmaceuticals sorbed to solids described by the sorption coefficient kd may be removed from wastewater by removing the solids in that case pharmaceutical removal during coagulation flocculation can be predicted based on the kd values in this study this mechanism is referred to as plain sorption in fig 1 the percentage of sorbed pharmaceuticals in wastewater with a typical total suspended solids tss concentration of 250 g l is displayed red dashed line plotted against the log kd when a suspended solids removal efficiency of 100 due to coagulation flocculation is assumed the red dashed line describes the removal of pharmaceuticals by the plain sorption mechanism the formula of this line is given in eq 1 with kd as sorption coefficient in l kg and tss as total suspended solids in kg l 1 r e m o v a l p e r c e n t a g e 100 k d 1 t s s k d in the higher log kd range 3 5 the observed removal percentages correspond well with the percentages of predicted removal however in the lower log kd ranges 3 5 lower removal is predicted by the plain sorption mechanism then what was measured in order to optimize the removal efficiency of pharmaceuticals the mechanism of removal by flocculation and coagulation should be understood starting with the explanation of the difference in predicted and empirically observed removal in raw sewage 1 3 the colloid mechanism in fig 1 there seems to be a discrepancy between predicted removal based on the kd value red dashed line and observed removal in the low kd value range this discrepancy could be explained by the role of colloids colloids are often said to play an important role in the fate of pharmaceuticals 20 23 table 1 shows the sorption to colloids reported in literature which indicates that even pharmaceuticals with low reported kd values such as carbamazepine can have strong affinity with colloids since coagulation flocculation can be applied to remove particulates of colloidal size 19 and colloids are reported to bind a disproportionally large fraction of pharmaceuticals colloids could explain the difference between expected removal of pharmaceuticals during coagulation flocculation and observed removal the possibility of removal of colloidally sorbed pharmaceuticals with coagulation flocculation is referred to as the colloid mechanism in this study with the colloid mechanism a larger fraction of pharmaceuticals can be removed from water with coagulation flocculation than what is expected based on the kd value plain sorption mechanism because there is a disproportionally large fraction of pharmaceuticals sorbed to colloids 1 4 aims of this study the hypothesis of this study is that pharmaceuticals can be removed from wastewater by coagulation flocculation of pharmaceutical containing colloids this was tested by studying the removal of 16 measured pharmaceuticals in raw wastewater when applying coagulation flocculation after it appeared that pharmaceuticals could not be removed in the mentioned test we investigated the discrepancy between reported colloidal sorption of pharmaceuticals and the lack of

filtration of colloids raises the question if retaining pharmaceuticals is a matter of sorption to retained colloids as is often stated or mere retention of non sorbed pharmaceutical molecules in the

over 90 of the pharmaceuticals 33 35 in the lower range of the cut off 0 09 kda the retention is dominated by steric size exclusion in the higher range 0 270 kda both steric size exclusion and electrostatic repulsion causes the removal of these large molecules 33 36 37 however also larger pore sizes have been shown to retain pharmaceuticals burba et al 38 showed that over 70 of diclofenac in colloid free water is retained with a 1 kda cut off polyethersulfon pes membrane but also in matrices with colloids the pharmaceuticals retention of the membrane may be guided by other factors than colloidal sorption for 0 270 kda membranes cake built up on the membrane surface can decrease pharmaceutical retention 39 therefore using membrane filtration with membrane pore sizes of 1 kda for colloidal sorption determination may yield unreliable results because of direct filtration of the pharmaceuticals or by pharmaceutical interactions with the cake layer on the membrane 3 3 ultra filtration of pharmaceuticals to test the possibility of direct removal retention of unbound pharmaceuticals by uf an experiment was performed in which colloids in a solution with pharmaceuticals were removed in two ways by uf and by flocculation the pharmaceutical removal during the removal of colloids in the form of hs by uf was compared to pharmaceutical removal with colloids removal by flocculation in fig 3 the pharmaceutical removal efficiencies of the uf and flocculation experiment are shown in both cases the removal of hs was near complete 91 with uf and 85 with flocculation

kd value or the octanol partition coefficient log kow table 3 because the removal of hs with uf and flocculation were comparable the difference in pharmaceutical removal efficiency cannot be explained by sorption to hs these results show that the use of uf for determining colloidal sorption may lead to overestimation of pharmaceuticals sorbed to colloids what factors play a role in the removal with uf should be investigated further 4 conclusion pharmaceuticals were not removed from sewage by settling even when coagulation flocculation was applied therewith the hypothesis of this study was rejected despite the reports of colloidal sorption of pharmaceuticals in literature and the fact that colloids are removed during coagulation flocculation the measured 16 pharmaceuticals were apparently not attached to these colloids for the determination of colloidal sorption of pharmaceuticals many authors use a lower cut off as low as 1 kda for colloids during uf filtration in a comparison of pharmaceutical removal in an experiment where colloids were removed by coagulation flocculation and an experiment where colloids were removed by uf it was observed that the 1 kda cut off can cause direct retention of pharmaceuticals direct retention may lead to an overestimation of colloidal sorption of pharmaceuticals this possible overestimation using uf for estimating colloidal sorption of pharmaceuticals may explain why there is no observed removal of pharmaceuticals when applying coagulation flocculation on sewage it can be concluded that coagulation flocculation is not a

14103,literature frequently reports that colloids in aqueous matrices sorb a large fraction of pharmaceuticals since coagulation flocculation removes colloids it is expected that coagulation flocculation in principle should be useful in concentrating pharmaceuticals in wastewater treatment which would facilitate the treatment of these refractory compounds in our present work we researched the potential of coagulation flocculation for removing pharmaceuticals from raw sewage results from jar tests showed that pharmaceuticals are hardly removed from sewage with coagulation flocculation to investigate the discrepancy between reported colloidal sorption and the lack of removal when removing colloids we tested a commonly applied experimental setup which makes use of ultra filtration uf for determining the colloidal sorption of pharmaceuticals the uf method under research was compared with an assessment making use of flocculation both methods uf and flocculation showed similar removal of colloids however during uf the retention of pharmaceuticals reached values up to 93 4 in contrast when removing the colloids with flocculation no pharmaceutical removal was observed these results confirm that it is very likely to introduce an analysis bias in using uf membranes in the determination of colloidal sorption of pharmaceuticals in fact results predict an over estimation caused by a direct retention of pharmaceuticals without any binding to colloidal matter overall results of the current work show that pharmaceuticals hardly sorb to colloids and herewith the absence of removal of pharmaceuticals during coagulation flocculation is explained keywords pharmaceutical filtration sorption wastewater colloids 1 introduction in general pharmaceuticals consumed by humans are subsequently transferred into the sewer through human excreta since pharmaceuticals in many cases are recalcitrant towards biological degradation sewage treatment plants stps often do not completely remove these pharmaceutical compounds 1 2 therefore the main source of pharmaceuticals in surface waters is often stp effluent discharge 3 although the pharmaceutical concentrations in these discharges are low ng l to μg l 1 4 8 enhanced removal is necessary in order to prevent adverse effects on ecology and accumulation in the aquatic environment especially when considering an increase in pharmaceutical consumption in europe is observed over time 9 1 1 mechanisms of removal of organic micro pollutants with coagulation flocculation treatment of organic micro pollutants omps in low concentrations such as pharmaceuticals is challenging hence current practice of treatment in common stps is not sufficient yet 7 10 11 a feasible strategy to enhance the treatment effectiveness might be to concentrate omps in the sludge stream prior to super critical sludge gasification the research platform of the dutch water authorities showed that supercritical gasification of sewage sludge is potentially a feasible option for future stps 12 and this treatment would likely destroy all pharmaceutical molecules in relatively clean water such as drinking water or ultra pure water the removal of pharmaceuticals by coagulation flocculation is very poor 13 16 however adding organic matter before coagulation flocculation can increase the pharmaceutical removal significantly 16 in wastewaters rich in organic compounds such as sewage omp removal up to 80 is observed using coagulation flocculation 4 17 choi et al 18 showed that antibiotics are removed to approximately 50 from river water applying poly aluminium chloride these results indicate that the presence of organic matter may enhance the removal of pharmaceuticals during coagulation flocculation coagulation flocculation comprises of two different processes 19 1 the tendency for suspended matter to form larger aggregates promoted by altered surface properties and 2 the removal of dissolved matter by precipitation to our knowledge precipitation of pharmaceuticals in wastewater as a mean of removal has not been reported in literature therefore if removal of pharmaceuticals due to coagulants flocculants is observed the responsible removal mechanism is likely linked to the removal of suspended matter that acts as a vehicle for pharmaceuticals this would imply that there is a relation between sorption of pharmaceuticals to suspended matter expressed by the adsorption desorption distribution coefficient kd l kg and their removal efficiencies by coagulation flocculation this hypothesis is supported by results of carballa et al 4 suarez et al 17 and ruan et al 1 that show that coagulation in raw sewage yields a more or less linear relationship between removal efficiencies and log kd values of omps fig 1 the higher the sorption the higher the removal efficiency in addition the observation is made that pharmaceuticals in milliq water so without solids are hardly removed by coagulation 16 1 2 plain sorption mechanism the pharmaceuticals sorbed to solids described by the sorption coefficient kd may be removed from wastewater by removing the solids in that case pharmaceutical removal during coagulation flocculation can be predicted based on the kd values in this study this mechanism is referred to as plain sorption in fig 1 the percentage of sorbed pharmaceuticals in wastewater with a typical total suspended solids tss concentration of 250 g l is displayed red dashed line plotted against the log kd when a suspended solids removal efficiency of 100 due to coagulation flocculation is assumed the red dashed line describes the removal of pharmaceuticals by the plain sorption mechanism the formula of this line is given in eq 1 with kd as sorption coefficient in l kg and tss as total suspended solids in kg l 1 r e m o v a l p e r c e n t a g e 100 k d 1 t s s k d in the higher log kd range 3 5 the observed removal percentages correspond well with the percentages of predicted removal however in the lower log kd ranges 3 5 lower removal is predicted by the plain sorption mechanism then what was measured in order to optimize the removal efficiency of pharmaceuticals the mechanism of removal by flocculation and coagulation should be understood starting with the explanation of the difference in predicted and empirically observed removal in raw sewage 1 3 the colloid mechanism in fig 1 there seems to be a discrepancy between predicted removal based on the kd value red dashed line and observed removal in the low kd value range this discrepancy could be explained by the role of colloids colloids are often said to play an important role in the fate of pharmaceuticals 20 23 table 1 shows the sorption to colloids reported in literature which indicates that even pharmaceuticals with low reported kd values such as carbamazepine can have strong affinity with colloids since coagulation flocculation can be applied to remove particulates of colloidal size 19 and colloids are reported to bind a disproportionally large fraction of pharmaceuticals colloids could explain the difference between expected removal of pharmaceuticals during coagulation flocculation and observed removal the possibility of removal of colloidally sorbed pharmaceuticals with coagulation flocculation is referred to as the colloid mechanism in this study with the colloid mechanism a larger fraction of pharmaceuticals can be removed from water with coagulation flocculation than what is expected based on the kd value plain sorption mechanism because there is a disproportionally large fraction of pharmaceuticals sorbed to colloids 1 4 aims of this study the hypothesis of this study is that pharmaceuticals can be removed from wastewater by coagulation flocculation of pharmaceutical containing colloids this was tested by studying the removal of 16 measured pharmaceuticals in raw wastewater when applying coagulation

zno layer on pp hollow fiber membrane separation properties and organic fouling tendency of the composite membrane are investigated during the peat water filtration results show that psf peg400 zno layer is successfully deposited on pp membrane evidenced by scanning electron microscopy and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis zno particles increase membrane hydrophilicity shown by decreasing water contact angle from 97 7 to 77 1 which results in higher pure water permeability from 16 to 46 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 higher hydrophilicity also reduces organic fouling tendency of the membrane during peat water treatment the flux recovery ratio increases from 63 to 66 while relative flux reduction decreases from 53 to 44 the composite pp membrane m zno 40 is able to remove 70 humic substances from peat water results of this study show that the addition psf peg400 zno layer can effectively improve membrane permeability selectivity and anti organic fouling of pp hollow fiber membrane keywords additive fouling hydrophilic peat water polymeric membrane 1 introduction peat water is a potential water source that can be used for supplying clean or drinking water in a remote area especially for those who live in peatland however peat water contains a high concentration of dissolved organic matters thus peat water treatment process is required several technologies have been proposed for peat water treatment among the technologies ultrafiltration membrane provides the interesting features of simple operation less energy consumption lower footprint and lower cost 1 5 in membrane operation fouling becomes a major challenge 6 9 fouling is associated with the accumulation of substances on the membrane surface or within the membrane pores this fouling not only leads to productivity decline but also requires of additional energy supply to keep the membrane performance constant 10 12 to solve this problem various strategies have been proposed which include pre treatment optimization controlling operating conditions and developing membrane with antifouling properties 13 17 one of the most important identified foulants found in surface water sources is organic substances organic fouling on the membrane surface can be controlled by endowing membrane surface with a more hydrophilic layer the hydrophilic surface will reduce the fouling tendency of organic substances which are typically hydrophobic on the membrane membranes with the hydrophilic surface are able to form a hydrogen bond with water molecules thus produce water layer on the membrane surface the presence of the water layer is able to prevent or reduce the undesirable adsorption or adhesion of foulants at the membrane surface thus enhances water permeate flux and mitigate membrane fouling 18 20 modification of membrane can be done by blending of the original polymer with polymers having more suitable properties or by addition of polymer layers on the active surface of membrane there are several methods for modifying the membrane surface such as plasma treatment in situ polymerization dip coating etc dip coating is a facile method modifying membrane surface in previous study 21 it has been demonstrated that the dip coating method has successfully increased the hydrophobicity of a polypropylene pp membrane by creating a rougher surface however dip coating method for increasing hydrophilicity of pp membrane in water treatment especially for peat water filtration application is rarely reported nanoparticles and various hydrophilic additives have been used for hydrophilic modification on pp membrane 22 29 among the additives zno has increasingly been used due to its antibacterial and antifouling properties as well as lower cost the zno particles are toxic to several bacteria both gram positive and gram negative 30 34 therefore zno can be used for two purposes i e increasing antifouling and antimicrobial properties in this work composite polypropylene based membrane pp with lower organic fouling is prepared by coating psf peg400 zno layer on pp hollow fiber membrane via the dip coating method separation properties and organic fouling tendency of the composite membrane are studied during the peat water filtration in addition membrane morphology and its chemical structure are also analyzed 2 materials and method 2 1 materials polypropylene

curve water contact angle wca between a water droplet and the outer surfaces of the membrane was measured using goniometry method demineralized water was dropped on the membrane surface by using a

morphology of composite membrane chemical structure of the membrane was examined by ftir and the result is shown in fig 2 compared to the bear pp membrane the composite membrane shows several new peaks a broad band at 3000 to 3600 cm 1 shows functional group of oh which indicates the presence of peg400 in the membrane coating layer the composite pp membrane also shows peaks at 1200 and 1100 cm 1 which can be attributed to the sulfonic groups these groups may be associated with the psf a sharp peak is also found at 560 cm 1 showing the presence of zno therefore ir spectra of the composite membrane show that additional layer containing psf peg400 and zno was successfully coated on the pp membrane surface the results also indicate that the simple dip coating method may be used as an alternative technique for preparing composite uf membrane sem images of the bear pp and composite pp membranes are shown in fig 3 fig 3 b1 shows the surface of pp membrane the pore size of the pp membrane is about 40 50 nm after being coated by psf the pp membrane shows a new layer on the membrane surface fig 3 a2 and a3 fig 3 b2 is the sem image of m zno 0 membrane at a similar magnification 10 000 the m zno 0 displays the new surface which is attributed to the psf layer as shown in fig 3 b2 the psf layer has relatively large pores even though the psf layer was formed by evaporation method the formation of relatively large pores may be due to the presence of peg400 unlike m zno 0 membrane m zno 40 membrane shows several aggregates on the psf layer which represents zno particles the presence of zno particles in the m zno 40 leads to the formation of larger pores than those formed in m zno 0 membrane the particles decrease the interconnection of the polymer during membrane formation thus it creates voids in the polymeric layer 3 2 pure water permeability pwp and water contact angle wca fig 4 a shows the pwp of the composite pp membrane the pwp increases with the increase of zno concentration it is well known that peg400 and zno are hydrophilic additives thus the introduction of these additives results in higher hydrophilicity it is in accordance with the results of this study where the pwp of the composite membrane is increased by zno in addition the higher zno results in a higher porosity fig 4 a the higher porosity may also contribute to the improved permeability by introducing zno nanoparticles new voids may be formed between zno and polymer as the effect of incompatibility consequently the porosity is increased by increasing zno content the increase of membrane hydrophilicity is confirmed by the decrease in wca fig 4b as shown of fig 4b the wca of m zno 40 membrane is lower than the m zno 0 according to those results the zno may have roles in increasing hydrophilicity and inducing a higher porosity 3 3 peat water filtration and fouling analysis to evaluate the separation properties and organic fouling tendency the composite membrane was used in peat water filtration natural peat water obtained from a local river in riau indonesia was used as the feed the filtration was operated at dead end filtration mode several composite membrane fibers were used to fabricate a mini module pp fibers were potted in u configuration which may simplify membrane operation for those who live in the remote area the peat water and permeate of composite membrane were analyzed and the absorbances and photographs are shown in fig 5 a and b respectively the composite membrane can reduce the absorbance up to 68 the decrease in absorbance value is associated with the reduction of humic substances content in other words it may imply that the composite membrane is able to remove 68 humic substances from the peat water fig 5 b also shows that the composite membranes are able to increase the clarity of the peat water even though m zno 40 membrane displays a drastic increase almost 3 times in pwp compared to m zno 0 the m zno 40 membrane exhibits almost a similar humic substances removal fig 5c this result indicates that combining peg400 and zno particles can produce membrane with better permeability and selectivity peat water contains humic substances which can cause fouling formation on the membrane surface a rapid decrease of membrane flux was observed since the membrane was operated at dead end filtration mode the flux was reduced to almost half of its initial value fig 6 a the m zno 40 membrane exhibited a lower flux reduction than the m zno 0 membrane fig 6a this may be due to the presence of zno which helps to reduce the fouling tendency of organic substances on the membrane surface as zno increases membrane hydrophilicity 37 38 m zno 40 membrane also display higher flux recovery than the m zno 0 a flux recovery of 80 was obtained by a simple back flushing with the membrane permeate for determining fouling mechanism several models were used a cake filtration b complete blocking c combined cake filtration complete blocking and d cake filtration followed by complete blocking the models show the declining water flux j as the function of filtration time t models describing those mechanism are as follow 39 40 cake filtration 2 j jo 1 2 kcf jo2 t 1 2 complete blocking 3 j jo exp kcb t combined cake filtration complete blocking 4 j jo exp kcb kcf jo 2 1 2 kcf jo 2 t 1 2 1 1 2kcf jo2 t 1 2 where jo is intial water flux and kcf and kcb are fouling parameter for cake filtration and complete blocking respectively fig 6 b shows that model cake filtration complete blocking gives the best result the lowest error of 6 5 therefore it may imply that the fouling mechanism in the peat water filtration was cake filtration followed by complete blocking cake filtration occurred in the first 330 s followed by the formation of complete blocking in the next operation time fouling parameters of m zno 0 and m zno 40 membranes are shown in fig 6 c overall m zno 40 has lower fouling parameters i e rfr rr rir and rt than m zno 40 but higher frr than m zno 0 this might be due to the weaker attachment of organic substances on the m zno 40 than m zno 0 therefore the foulant could be easier to remove from the m zno 40 membrane surface 41 the weaker attachment may due to the fact that more hydrophilic surface has lower membrane foulant interaction as the result anti organic fouling of m zno 40 was improved due to the hydrophilic nature of zno 4 conclusion in this work composite pp based membrane with lower organic fouling tendency was prepared by coating psf peg400 zno layer on pp hollow fiber membrane via dip coating method results show that the simple dip coating method was successfully employed to deposit psf peg400 zno layer on pp membrane surface evidenced by the results of ftir and sem analysis zno particles could increase membrane hydrophilicity shown by decreasing wca from 97 7 to 77 1 which resulted in higher pwp from 16 to 46 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 the higher hydrophilicity also reduced organic fouling tendency of the membrane during peat water treatment frr from 63 to 66 and rfr from 53 to 44 in addition the composite pp membrane m zno 40 was able to remove about 70 humic substances from peat water declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

membrane keywords additive fouling hydrophilic peat water polymeric membrane 1 introduction peat water is a potential water source that can be used for supplying clean or drinking water in a remote area especially for those who live in peatland however peat water contains a high concentration of dissolved organic matters thus peat water treatment process is required several technologies have been proposed for peat water treatment among the technologies ultrafiltration membrane provides the interesting features of simple operation less energy consumption lower footprint and lower cost 1 5 in membrane operation fouling becomes a major challenge 6 9 fouling is associated with the accumulation of substances on the membrane surface or within the membrane pores this fouling not only leads to productivity decline but also requires of additional energy supply to keep the membrane performance constant 10 12 to solve this problem various strategies have been proposed which include pre treatment optimization controlling operating conditions and developing membrane with antifouling properties 13 17 one of the most important identified foulants found in surface water sources is organic substances organic fouling on the membrane surface can be controlled by endowing membrane surface with a more hydrophilic layer the hydrophilic surface will reduce the fouling tendency of organic substances which are typically hydrophobic on the membrane membranes with the hydrophilic surface are able to form a hydrogen bond with water molecules thus produce water layer on the membrane surface the presence of the water layer is able to prevent or reduce the undesirable adsorption or adhesion of foulants at the membrane surface thus enhances water permeate flux and mitigate membrane fouling 18 20 modification of membrane can be done by blending of the original polymer with polymers having more suitable properties or by addition of polymer layers on the active surface of membrane there are several methods for modifying the membrane surface such as plasma treatment in situ polymerization dip coating etc dip coating is a facile method modifying membrane surface in previous study 21 it has been demonstrated that the dip coating method has successfully increased the hydrophobicity of a polypropylene pp membrane by creating a rougher surface however dip coating method for increasing hydrophilicity of pp membrane in water treatment especially for peat water filtration application is rarely reported nanoparticles and various hydrophilic additives have been used for hydrophilic modification on pp membrane 22 29 among the additives zno has increasingly been used due to its antibacterial and antifouling properties as well as lower cost the zno particles are toxic to several bacteria both gram positive and gram negative 30 34 therefore zno can be used for two purposes i e increasing antifouling and antimicrobial properties in this work composite polypropylene
