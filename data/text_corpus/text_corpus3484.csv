17420,effective pollution control and remediation strategies are the key to providing a major progress in conservation of coastal and marine biodiversity for the development of such strategies quantitative assessment of potentially toxic metals ptms and the accurate identification of the pollutant sources are essential in this study we seek to find out spatial ptms distribution in the coastal sediments of the persian gulf iran to assess the potential eco environmental risks and to identify the metal pollution sources total and fraction analysis indicated considerable metal zn cu mn fe al hg pb cd as cr co ni and v pollution levels albeit in most cases ptms were predominantly associated with the oxidizable and residual fractions the obtained ptms concentrations were in the range of 22 8 156 3 16 6 161 9 2 7 88 10 4 107 3 1 1 35 8 0 8 27 9 0 1 1 3 1 1 21 3 0 04 1 9 mg kg 1 for v ni cu zn cr co hg pb and cd respectively the combined ptm pca pmf modeling approach identified four main metal sources anthropogenic vehicle related agricultural and lithogenic in the study area several recognizable hot spots with extremely high metal concentrations were observed in the spatial metal pollution patterns some of those locations were predominantly affected by the nearby industrial activities while others have demonstrated contributions from several sources not only anthropogenic but also agricultural and vehicle related the same spots of elevated pollution were found to demonstrate higher potential eco environmental risk various indexes indicated more or less similar trends the eco environmental risk was gradually increasing towards the northwestern part of the study area with several peaks in the central and eastern parts directly affected by the nearby industrial activities graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords coastal ecosystem sediment spatial patterns fractionation risk assessment co occurrence network pca pmf 1 introduction the persian gulf hosts a huge variety of important natural coastal habitats such as coral reefs seagrass beds mangroves estuarine ecosystems sandy and rocky shores sharifinia et al 2019 not only do these habitats provide nutrients and shelter for various marine species they also prevent the coast from erosion and the destructive actions of storms and provide an array for fishing and recreational activities duraiappah et al 2005 sharifinia et al 2019 despite their enormous importance nearly 60 of such ecosystems have been degraded worldly duraiappah 2005 ivanov et al al 2019 rapid changes in the marine environment along the iranian coasts are reported as well sheppard et al 2010 kamrani et al 2016 ecological disturbance in this sensitive area arises in large part due to the oil related activities sharifinia et al 2018 moreover a serious threat is caused by the intense coastal habitat modification dredging infilling and conversion of shallow waters into land and urbanization sheppard et al 2010 al ghadban and price 2002 the loss or impairment of biodiversity comes hand in hand with the increasing anthropogenic activities and urbanization sharifinia et al 2019 and the coastal sediments are usually strongly affected by the aeolian and alluvial processes libes 2009 resulting in high loadings of the terrigenous matter which in turn is responsible for the intense accumulation of the land derived pollutants gao et al 2012 the polluted sediment could subsequently serve as an inner pollution source for water via resuspension wang et al 2020 ranjbar jafarabadi et al 2020 to provide a major progress in conservation of coastal and marine biodiversity management and pollution control is an urgency potentially toxic metals ptms pollution has been a growing problem for decades maghrebi et al 2018 wang et al 2020 due to their high toxicity persistence and non biodegradability arambourou et al 2020 there is a critical need to understand the spatial distribution chemical fractionation potential risk and contamination sources of metals in the marine environments ranjbar jafarabadi et al 2020 2018 lintern et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 moreover it is urgent to create strategies that could prevent or at least diminish the ptms pollution for the development of such strategies the accurate identification of pollutant sources is essential xia et al 2020 lintern et al 2016 multiple methods have been applied to qualitatively identify metal sources in sediments receptor models such as principal component analysis pca and positive matrix factorization pmf being often the preferred options duodu et al 2017 xia et al 2020 pca explains the variance of large datasets by contracting them into a set of factors with reduced dimensions salim et al 2019 ogwueleka 2014 the pmf model proposed by usepa provides qualitative source apportionment and contribution calculation of the environmental pollutants if combined with the spatial analysis pmf enables exploration of a detailed information on the factors regulating metal pollutant distribution comero et al 2014 xia et al 2020 pmf is very useful for the effective classification of the pollutants and development of the heavy metals hms remediation strategies xia et al 2020 despite numerous researches reported on hms pollution in the persian gulf only a handful of studies were dealing with the coastal sediment pollution arfaeinia et al 2019 maghrebi et al 2018 lahijanzadeh et al 2019 kazemi et al al 2012 agah et al 2012 pourang et al 2005 moreover to best of our knowledge there is a lack of the large scale studies covering broad coastal areas of the gulf the aim of this study was to determine the current status of ptms contamination in the persian gulf coastal ecosystem s sediments to pinpoint the major ptms regions with high ecological risks and find the potential pollution sources primary objectives of this research were to 1 analyze and map the ptms spatial variation at a large scale 2 reveal ptms chemical fractions and mobility 4 demonstrate the trends and patterns of eco environmental risks using geo statistics and gis 5 explore source types and quantify the proportion of various sources for each ptm using the co occurrence network and pca pmf based approaches this study provides wide pivotal information and guidance for hms pollution risk control and remediation strategies in coastal ecosystems 2 materials and methods 2 1 site descriptions and sampling points the persian gulf is a semi enclosed shallow water body with a limited water exchange sharifinia et al 2018 the unique features of the gulf such as high organic carbon content anoxic reduced conditions and high primary productivity create perfect conditions for the uptake and accumulation of various pollutants ranjbar jafarabadi et al 2020 hosting about two thirds of the world s oil sources the gulf is exposed to high risks associated with oil extraction refineries transportation and direct effluents discharge generated in coastal cities khazaali et al 2016 moreover agriculture lands urban areas and industrial centers fig 1 are located along the coast of the gulf lahijanzadeh et al 2019 in the present large scale study we seek to cover the areas of varying land use to this end 54 sampling sites were selected from the coastal area of the persian gulf fig 1 in july 2016 the sampling sites were classified based on their location hormozgan province s coastal zone hpcz pg1 pg36 bushehr province s coastal zone bpcz pg37 pg52 and khuzestan province s coastal zone kpcz pg53 pg54 sediment samples were taken from the top sediment layer 0 5 cm using a stainless steel grab sampler beneath the sediment water interface and then samples were stored on ice bag until being returned to the laboratory as soon as possible three distinct particle size fractions were separated to evaluate the influence of grain size on ptms distribution in the studied coastal sediments each grain size fraction was weighed and stored in plastic bags prior to analysis 2 2 sediment preparation a detailed description of the sediment preparation and analysis is given in the appendix section a1 distribution of particle size was conducted using a laser scattering analyzer horiba la 950v2 and detailed information has been described in our previous work ranjbar jafarabadi et al 2018 the calcium carbonate content of sediments was measured using the procedure described by muller and gastner i971 this method uses the increase in pressure produced by mixing hci with a sample contained in a carbonate bomb the organic matter om content was determined by the walkley black method faniran and areola 1978 and the chemical speciation for partitioning of trace metals into fractions was conducted as suggested by tessier et al 1979 and chao 1972 for the metal analysis samples were prepared according to saher and siddiqui 2019 descriptions of the quality control and assurance statistical analysis evaluation of the sediment contamination are reported in the appendix info sections a3 a5 3 results 3 1 coastal sediment characteristics one way anova results indicated a significant difference in toc tom bc and grain size values among the industrial and non industrial sites p 0 05 the grain size range average declined in the order of clay 8 07 96 67 81 10 silt sand in bpcz silt 1 31 91 80 13 68 clay 0 19 10 59 2 22 sand in kpcz sand 2 32 97 57 80 42 silt 0 99 97 68 12 11 and clay 0 00 20 00 7 47 in hpcz overall the contents of fine particles in the coastal zones of the persian gulf clay and silt augmented towards the west whereas an opposite trend was observed for sand fig 2 caco3 content varied from 30 to 80 in clay from 8 to 50 in silt and from 2 to 30 in sand it s content in sediment fractions was proportional to the sediment grain size the concentrations of toc and tom mg g 1 were 2 85 16 76 g kg 1 9 77 g kg 1 respectively and 2 85 16 76 g kg 1 9 77 g kg 1 in hpcz 1 50 13 49 g kg 1 9 64 g kg 1 and 2 85 16 76 g kg 1 9 77 g kg 1 in kpcz and 1 50 13 49 g kg 9 64 g kg 1 and 2 85 16 76 g kg 9 77 gkg 1 in bpcz a significant fluctuation was observed in the horizontal distribution of the toc and tom contents with spatial location for all the sites fig 2 spatially the concentrations of toc tom and bc increased towards the west of the persian gulf fig 2 ph values varied from 5 92 to 8 74 and demonstrated a complex spatial pattern in general a decreasing trend towards the west was observed with the lowest values being found in industrial stations pg35 pg36 pg44 48 pg51 54 eh varied between 397and 83 3 2 ptms concentrations in the coastal sediments one way anova f test p 0 05 revealed significant differences in the ptms concentrations along the study area the highest concentrations and a uniform spatial distribution in the coastal sediment were recorded for al mn and fe the second highest loadings were observed for v and ni their concentrations varied from 22 8 to 156 3 and from 16 6 to 161 9 respectively cu zn cr co hg pb cd concentrations were in the range of 2 7 88 10 4 107 3 1 1 35 8 0 8 27 9 0 1 1 3 1 1 21 3 0 04 1 9 mg kg respectively all of the above mentioned metals exhibited increasing loadings in the following order hpcz kpcz bpcz in contrast an increasing trend towards the east was observed for as the highest as loadings were observed in the stations pg6 pg7 and pg1 which have been characterized by relatively low loadings of the remaining metals a representative for pb pollution in three different zones of the study area is given in fig 3 for the sake of brevity such figure was only drawn for pb as drawing them for all the investigated metals would have required 10 additional figures fig 3 reveals that the highest metal loadings were observed in the sampling stations pg22 23 pg26 pg28 pg37 38 pg39 42 and pg52 54 similar spatial trends were observed for other metals except for as 3 3 determining ptm pollution sources 3 3 1 co occurrence network to assess the relationships between ptms and to detect the presence of their common sources in the study area a co occurrence network analysis was performed liu et al 2015 the co occurrence network was constructed using the spearman s correlation coefficients p 0 6 between ptms as was excluded from the co occurrence network due to its weak or insignificant correlations with the other metals the most significant co occurrence correlations were obtained between zn cd and cu fig 4 high co occurrence correlations were also observed for these three metals and ni cr and pb pb correlated also well with co v cr and showed a significant correlation with al and fe weaker albeit still significant co occurrence correlations were observed for hg and v with cu cd and pb mn has shown relatively low co occurrence correlations with all the metals except ni 3 3 2 principle component analysis pca and pmf model pca analysis is typically applied for the identification of the potential pollution sources zhi et al 2016 kang et al 2017 in addition pca analysis could be run prior to pmf modeling in order to determine the number of factors for pmf models xia et al 2020 in this study pca analysis was applied for both purposes when the pca analysis was performed with all the metals included into a dataset it resulted in 5 factors being obtained however one of them was predominantly loaded with as it could be seen from the fig 6 that as had a completely different spatial distribution pattern and was distinguished from other metals by the cluster analysis moreover arsenic did not have a significant correlation with any of the remaining metals considering this we decided to exclude as from the final pca analysis for the sake of clarity and to assume that a separate as source is present in the study area with this being done four main driving factors were identified in the study area covering 92 2 of the total variance fig 5 determining the optimum number of factors for the pmf analysis was done by readjusting the number of sources from 2 to 6 till the value of q closest to the number of degrees of freedom was obtained the number of factors providing the minimum q robust qexp value was considered as an optimum one just like in the case of pca analysis four was the optimum number of factors for the base model run as and al did not demonstrate a significant correlation between the observed and the predicted values neither were their peak values reproduced well by the model thus both al and as were determined as bad and were excluded from the model mn v and hg had more significant correlation between the observed and predicted values 0 540 0 623 and 0 497 respectively but their peak values were not well reproduced by the model in relation to that their contribution to the model was down weighted and these three metals were set as weak in the base model run the measured ptm concentrations were compared to the ones predicted by the pmf model and determination coefficients r2 were used to evaluate the efficacy of the model predictions the lowest r2 of 0 550 was recorded for fe whereas r 2 for the remaining metals were in the range of 0 769 and 1 00 the highest r 2 values were found for cu 1 00 ni 1 00 pb 1 00 and zn 0 999 and the ptm concentrations predicted by the selected source factors in the pmf model were well explained results of the pmf model analysis are summarized in fig 8 4 discusion 4 1 ptms pollution hazardous areas in the coastal ecosystem s sediments of the persian gulf metal distribution patterns in sediments are affected by environmental parameters such as organic matter content ph redox conditions to mention just a few sundaray et al 2011 spatially except for as metal concentration increased towards the north western part of the study area hpcz kpcz bpcz several recognizable hot spots hazardous areas were identified in the spatial metal pollution patterns sampling stations pg52 pg54 and pg41 pg42 fig 6 the extremely high metal concentrations observed in the kpcz hot spot sites were most likely associated with the runoff from the industrial parks located nearby in a meanwhile a more complex source to sink metal transport mechanism should be attributed to the north western part of the study area bpcz not only is this region affected by several industrial objects located nearby it is situated in the impact zone of several large cities and vast agricultural lands moreover this zone is largely affected by the river inflow pollutants collected from a broad catchment area of the tigris euphrates karun helleh hendijan and mond rivers enter the persian gulf in the northwestern part of the study area cunningham et al 2019 hence this zone is most probably affected by multiple metal pollution sources rivers atmospheric deposition and runoff from the industrial sites being the main pollution transportation routes in contrast as was characterized by an increasing trend towards the east the highest as loadings were observed in the stations pg6 pg7 and pg1 which have been characterized by relatively low loadings of the remaining metals fig 6 whereas stations pg6 and pg7 are located in the vicinity of the factories no potential pollution sources could be identified close to pg1 the distinct origin of as was further confirmed by the dual hierarchical clustering analysis which produced two main clusters where cluster 1 was attributed to as and cluster 2 to the remaining metals the cluster 2 was further sub divided into 6 sub clusters hg sub cluster 1 cd cu and cr sub cluster 2 pb al fe sub cluster 3 co v sub cluster 4 ni and zn sub cluster 5 and finally mn sub cluster 6 similar results were obtained for the iranian coral islands fig 6 whereas other metals had shown similar spatial distribution patterns as demonstrated the opposite trend ranjbar et al 2018 it indicates the presence of a separate source of arsenic in the persian gulf clay demonstrated higher ptm loadings than sand and silt this was further supported by the correlation analysis r was in the range of 0 46 and 0 75 between clay and metal concentrations p 0 005 this owes to the fact that clay is characterized by high fraction of the fine grained particles zhu et al 2019 moreover the presence of considerable content of caco3 in clay may have resulted in the increased sorbtion of metals jamshidi zanjani et al 2017 only as exhibited high concentrations in the sandy sediment with higher eh whereas clay has demonstrated high loadings of all the remaining ptms fig 7 in the sandy sediment fraction significant amount of caco3 was detected in the stations pg22 27 pg45 pg48 however caco3 content in sand did not play a prominent role in determining the metal pollution different trends were observed for silt and clay caco3 content in clay was found to play an important role in the sampling stations pg49 54 where the highest metal concentrations were recorded fig 7 carbonates are usually found to affect the distribution of cd and pb jamshidi zanjani et al 2017 in our study the highest correlation coefficients between caco3clay and metals were recorded for mn vu zn cr and cd r ranging from 0 32 to 0 46 p 0 005 the obtained results also reveal that carbonates in clay control variations of pb cd cu and cr in the sampling stations pg51 54 fig 7 whereas carbonates present in silt fraction play an important role for co and pb accumulation in the sampling stations pg22 23 fig 7 other factors such as high organic matter content are more important in the remaining sampling stations all the ptms except as showed significant affinity with tom and toc fig 7 the highest correlation coefficient was obtained between toc and al cu ni cr mn and fe r was in the range of 0 62 0 76 p 0 005 negative correlation r 0 37 was observed between as and toc for the remaining metals r was in the range of 0 49 0 56 p 0 005 organic carbon plays an important role in determining the metal distribution due to its large surface to volume ratio moreover it is also capable of forming complexes which would stabilize ptms in the sediment li et al 2019 all the ptms except as showed significant affinity with tom and toc fig 7 the highest correlation coefficient was obtained between toc and al cu ni cr mn and fe r was in the range of 0 62 0 76 p 0 005 negative correlation r 0 37 was observed between as and toc for the remaining metals r was in the range of 0 49 0 56 p 0 005 moreover it is also capable of forming complexes which would stabilize ptms in the sediment li et al 2019 the observed ptms concentrations were comparable to those detected in the coastal sediment of the persian gulf previously cu and cr loadings were similar to those recorded by arfaenia et al 2019 albeit lahijanzadeh et al 2019 has reported significantly higher levels of these two metals and the ones detected by sharifinia et al 2018 were much lower zn ni and pb demonstrated comparable loadings to the ones reported by maghrebi et al 2018 and mirza et al 2019 ni and pb levels were also comparable to those detected by lahijanzadeh et al 2019 table 1 as and co levels were also comparable to those observed by lahijanzadeh et al 2019 in a meantime cd concentrations were lower than the ones detected by arfaenia et al 2019 sharifinia et al 2018 and bastami et al 2015 but higher than those reported by lahijanzadeh et al 2019 maghrebi et al 2018 and mirza et al 2019 table 1 if compared to the studies conducted on the coral reefs of the persian gulf ranjbar et al 2020 2018 ptms loadings were significantly higher in the coastal sediment 4 2 pmf dynamics and identification of ptms pollution sources in our study high co occurrence correlations among the metals were obtained indicating the presence of common metal sources in the study area xia et al 2020 the highest co occurrence correlations were found between zn cd cu ni cr and pb revealing their common anthropogenic origin liu et al 2015 and xia et al 2020 have found high co occurrence correlations between pb zn cu ni and cr in the industrial sites characterized by highly complex human induced processes in agreement with that elevated concentrations of cu pb cd and zn were reported to originate from anthropogenic activities yu et al 2010 ranjbar et al 2020 mehr et al 2019 hu et al 2019 cunningham et al 2019 on the other hand fe and al are often used as the reference parameters to distinguish between the natural background and human induced pollution sources liu et al 2015 woods et al 2012 strong co occurrence correlation between al fe and the selected heavy metal would be indicative of its natural origin liu et al 2015 the potential industrial source pollutants zn cd cu and ni showed rather weak correlations with the reference items fe al indicating their human induced sources liu et al 2015 in a meanwhile pb and cr demonstrated both high correlations with the anthropogenic metals zn cd cu ni and high association with the reference metals al and fe which could mean their contribution to multiple sources part of cr and pb might be associated with the mineral lattice while some of the loading might arise from the human activities industrial processes vehicles agriculture liu et al 2015 pca analysis distinguished four main driving factors in the study area f1 was heavily loaded with cu cr pb cd co and was assumed to represent the local anthropogenic sources fig 5 f2 was prevailed by pb cd cu and zn and had a minor contribution of ni and cr we assumed that this component could be related to the vehicle activities and parking lots cu and cd are known to be used for car tires production while ni zn are used in automotive lubricants and pb pollution is often associated with the motorways salim et al 2019 the third component was characterized by high loadings of co and cd which have demonstrated rather weak co occurrence correlation fig 4 with the other metals the fourth component was heavily loaded with hg fig 5 this was consistent with the cluster analysis results hg was separated from the block of other elements revealing its distinct origin pmf modeling analysis gave different results than those observed by pca factor 1 demonstrated high contribution of cu 48 ni 49 and cd 49 the values given in the brackets represent the factor contribution on each metal whereas metal contributions to each factor can be seen in fig 8 ni is widely applied as an automotive lubricant while cu and cd are used in the car tire production and thus their presence in the sediment could be attributed to the vehicle brake emissions salim et al 2019 hwang et al 2016 high content of ptms in the urban coastal sediments of the persian gulf were attributed to the intense traffic of vehicle related activities runoff from the roads car repair shops and the gas stations degradation of tires and brakes arfaeinia et al 2019 speaking of the spatial f1 loadings its highest contribution was observed in the northwestern part of the study area pg39 pg54 in addition to several industrial objects located in the area it also contains large urban populations centers such as mahshahr and bandar e eman cities rastegari mehr et al 2019 moreover this zone is largely affected by the river inflow rivers are known to be the main transportation route for the vehicle related contaminants heavy metals originating from vehicles are deposited in the ambient environment and stay at the surficial soil layer or other nearby surfaces during the dry periods but stormwater runoff carries the deposited contaminants into the local receiving waters such as lakes ponds streams rivers and bays hwang et al 2016 dash et al 2020 pollutants collected from a broad catchment area of the tigris euphrates karun helleh hendijan and mond rivers enter the persian gulf in the northwestern part of the study area cunningham et al 2019 taking all of the above into account f1 was attributed to the vehicle related emission from the roadways and parking lots factor 2 demonstrated high loading of pb 63 cd 45 cr 39 co 39 and significant loadings of hg 28 and cu 28 the usage of leaded petrol burning of fossil fuel and the maritime traffic pb is utilized in the production of antifouling paints are named as the main sources of anthropogenic pb ranjbar et al 2020 mehr et al 2019 farag et al 2006 arfaeinia et al 2019 reported high pb and cu loadings in the northern part of the persian gulf and suggested that industrial combustion processes are responsible for such a trend whereas lahijanzadeh et al 2019 named mining activities industrial effluents metal processing units distillery units landfill leachates urban storm water fly ash of coal powered plants as the main sources of copper in the musa estuary the wastewater of the petrochemical companies paper dyeing and printing are among the main sources of hg pollution rastegari mehr et al 2019 cr pollution is closely related to the textile industry whereas cd is known to be mainly originating from the mining activities and refining of the non ferrous metal deposits hu et al 2019 cunningham et al 2019 the intense maritime traffic in the area should also contribute significantly to f2 farag et al 2006 all of the above suggest that f2 represents the local anthropogenic impact in agreement with that f2 played the most significant role in the sampling stations pg3 pg5 pg22 pg23 pg26 pg28 pg37 pg42 pg 52 pg54 fig 5 most of these stations are known to be affected by the intense industrial activities pg 22 pg 28 pg37 pg42 pg 52 pg54 in a meanwhile sampling stations pg3 pg 5 are located near the hormuz island and are affected by the tourism fishing and indigenous activities factor 3 was heavily loaded with zn 58 and was characterized by a significant contribution of cr 51 and cu 30 cuso4 used as a fungicide for fruits is a well known agricultural source of cu whereas zinc is used in the production of fungicides that are applied to crops and vegetables wu et al 2019 based on this we assumed that the third factor could be attributed to the agriculture this was only objected by the considerable loadings of chromium on the 3rd component cr is known to predominantly originate from the industrial activities ertani et al 2017 on the other hand sewage irrigation and sludge application for agriculture is a common practice in many countries wu et al 2019 ertani et al 2017 guan et al 2018 moreover significant cr loadings were observed by arfaeinia et al 2019 in the coastal sediments surrounded by agricultural lands northern persian gulf considering this high cr concentration recorded in the study area could be agriculture related despite the fact that its primary source should be of anthropogenic origin in addition to the high cr concentrations being observed arfaeinia et al 2019 has also reported high levels of zn and cu in the agricultural lands in the northern part of the persian gulf lahijanzadeh et al 2019 has suggested that some of the copper found in the sediment of musa estuary persian gulf might originate from the agricultural waste disposal fertilizers poultry sewage and compost a study by hu et al 2018 revealed large heavy metal loadings in the soil of agricultural regions in china which could be related to the use of various fertilizers and irrigation with contaminated water the assumption that factor 3 might be attributed to the agriculture was further confirmed by its spatial distribution trends they were similar to those observed for f1 a steady increase towards the northwestern part of the study area this zone is not only affected by the industrial activities and urban runoff it is also surrounded by the agricultural lands rastegari mehr et al 2019 arfaeinia et al 2019 and the large riverine input is the main route of the agriculture derived pollution in the northwestern part of the persian gulf ertani et al 2017 the fourth factor was attributed to the lithogenic heavy metal sources it was heavily loaded with fe 50 and mn 52 and had significant loadings of ni 42 zn 35 and v 39 high loadings of these metals are indicative of the natural soil parent materials which can be deposited in the sediment column through natural processes such as erosion weathering from the nearby areas dash et al 2020 guan et al 2018 relatively homogeneous spatial distribution pattern was exhibited by this factor stations located in the industrial parks did not demonstrate significantly increased loadings for f4 confirming the natural origin of these metals 4 3 eco environmental risk assessment 4 3 1 chemical fractionation and rac in the marine environment heavy metals tend to exist in a form of exchangeable carbonate bound reducible oxidizable or residual fraction kang et al 2017 zaaboub et al 2015 in this study derived metal fractions are presented in fig 9 al and mn were predominantly found in the residual f5 fraction elements accumulated in this fraction are not available for bio uptake as they are bounded within the silicate mineral lattices while the non residual fractions could participate in the biochemical reactions under favorable conditions zaaboub et al 2015 kang et al 2017 surprisingly fe did not demonstrate high loadings on f5 and was predominantly found at the reducible f3 fraction the same trend was observed for zn v was predominantly loaded on f4 as cr hg cd and cu demonstrated high loadings on both oxidizable f4 and residual f5 fractions whereas co pb ni and cr have also demonstrated occasional high loadings on f3 elevated proportions of exchangeable metals were observed in the sampling stations with higher anthropogenic input pg3 pg5 pg20 pg22 pg23 pg26 pg28 pg37 pg42 pg52 pg54 elements detected in the labile exchangeable fraction are often classified as the anthropogenic ones ji et al 2019 nazneen et al 2019 they enter the environment in a form of inorganic complexes or hydrate ions and are readily absorbed onto the sediment fine particles nazneen et al 2019 it was observed by several authors that the metal content in the mobile fraction increases with the increasing level of anthropogenic contamination tang et al 2015 ji et al 2019 xia et al 2020 exchangeable fraction is defined as the one posing the highest potential adverse biological effects due to its high lability and bioavailability while carbonate fraction is also generally accepted to have a direct effect on the marine biota świetlik et al 2015 the two remaining mobile fractions f3 and f4 are considered to be less dangerous forms świetlik et al 2015 in order to gain a deeper insight into the sediment toxicity and elements mobility risk assessment code was applied sundaray et al 2011 zhang et al 2017 based on the obtained rac values co cr and hg posed low to medium risk to the aquatic biota of the study area fig 10 as cd ni possessed low to high risk while pb and v have demonstrated occasional cases of a very high risk stations pg21 pg 27 pg 29 pg 30 from the hpcz and posed low to high risk in the remaining area the results are in agreement with other studies held in the persian gulf area as cd and cu were also found to pose moderate environmental risk by neyestani et al 2016 whereas ranjbar et al 2018 determined an elevated risk of v ni and cd and an occasional moderate risk of pb in the iranian coral reef islands in a most recent study of our group even higher rac values were obtained mn v ni cu and cr were found to pose a very high risk whereas pb cd as and hg demonstrated a high risk in the surficial sediment layer of the iranian coral islands fig 10 ranjbar et al 2020 in general all the elements posed a medium risk throughout the study area with some relatively safe regions of low risk and several local hot spots elevated rac values for as pb ni and v were observed in the northwestern part of the study area pg52 pg54 as v and ni have also demonstrated increased rac values in the stations pg3 pg5 and pg37 pg42 hotspots for pb were identified in the zones around pg3 pg10 pg22 pg30 and pg41 pg42 4 3 2 enrichment and contamination factors of all the metals analyzed cd has demonstrated the highest ef values and was followed by hg ni and cu fig a1 in the most affected sites ef values for cd reached 40 and indicated a very high enrichment even though the highest ef values for hg were twice lower around 22 they still did correspond to a very high enrichment the highest ef values for ni and cu were found to be 14 and 12 respectively and corresponded to a significant enrichment the remaining metals have demonstrated minimal to moderate enrichment comparable results were demonstrated in the persian gulf area by hyperlink l bib31 mehr et al 2019 mirza et al 2019 and lahijanzadeh et al 2019 sediment was the most heavily enriched with hg cd and ni indicating the impact of anthropogenic activities keshavarzi et al 2018 cf values for pb zn mn fe al as cr fell within the range of low pollution fig a2 the highest cf values for v cu co and ni corresponded to moderate pollution cf for hg corresponded to a considerable contamination at some points whereas cf values for cd in the most polluted sites were above 6 which classifies these zones as heavily polluted hakanson 1980 both cf and ef values have demonstrated similar spatial distribution trends varying between individual metals fig a1 fig a2 a unique spatial distribution pattern was attributed to as the highest cf and ef values being observed in the eastern part of the study area for the remaining metals the two factor values were increasing towards the north western part of the study area cu ni cr fe mn and zn have demonstrated similar patterns with the most polluted sites being recognized in the north western part of the study area stations pg51 pg54 medium levels in the central part and the lowest pollution in the eastern part the same was also true for cd and co except that they have also demonstrated high ef and cf values around the stations pg37 pg42 figs a1 a2 for hg v and pb both the north western and the central parts of the study area were identified as the mostly polluted sites 4 3 3 overall metal pollution effects metal pollution index and nemerow synthetic pollution index have demonstrated similar spatial pattern in both cases the hotspots were identified in the zones of the sampling stations pg51 54 and pg37 pg42 severe contamination with hms was observed in these regions han et al 2018 the central part of the study area has been slightly to moderately contaminated han et al 2018 whereas eastern part of the area was classified as non contaminated an obvious trend was observed for the m ermq values in the study area they were gradually increasing towards the north western part of the persian gulf fig 8 stations pg1 pg25 hpcz were attributed to the lowest priority sites pg51 pg54 bpzc and kpzc were characterized as high medium priority sites whereas the remaining stations in the central zone bpzc of the study area could be described as medium low priority sites similar trends were demonstrated by the metal risk index its highest values corresponding to a very high risk above 600 zhu et al 2012 were observed in the north western part of the study area stations pg51 pg54 bpzc and kpzc and were gradually decreasing towards east however differently from the previously described index occasional local zones of considerable risk were observed in the central part bpzc of the study area pg37 pg42 the eastern part of the study area hpzc was mainly characterized as an area of a low risk albeit several spots with elevated mri pg3 pg5 moderate risk have been observed 5 conclusion coastal sediments along the persian gulf were considerably contaminated by ptms which resulted in potential risks to aquatic ecosystems as it was indicated by various indices v and ni concentrations in the sediment varied from 22 8 to 156 3 and from 16 6 to 161 9 mg kg 1 respectively cu zn cr co hg pb cd concentrations were in the range of 2 7 88 10 4 107 3 1 1 35 8 0 8 27 9 0 1 1 3 1 1 21 3 0 04 1 9 mg kg 1 respectively as pb ni and v have demonstrated high ecological risk due to a high proportion in the bioavailable fractions however cd has demonstrated the highest ef values and was followed by hg ni and cu cd and hg were also identified as the main risk drivers based on the cf values mpi and npi based evaluation revealed several hotspots of the study area which were localized around the sampling stations pg37 pg42 central part and pg51 54 northern part mri and m ermq values were gradually increasing towards the north western part of the persian gulf four main metal sources were identified in the study area by the pca pmf approach whereas lithogenic sources showed more or less uniform spatial distribution agricultural and vehicle related metal sources have demonstrated a steadily increasing trend towards the north western part of the study area which is largely affected by the riverine inflow in a meanwhile anthropogenic sources mainly impacted the identified ptms pollution hotspots located as a rule close to the industrial objects this study provided metal pollution data on a large scale covering a vast region along the coast of the persian gulf the obtained results are important for the development of the source control and remediation strategies for the effective conservation of coastal and marine biodiversity table 1 declaration of

17420,effective pollution control and remediation strategies are the key to providing a major progress in conservation of coastal and marine biodiversity for the development of such strategies quantitative assessment of potentially toxic metals ptms and the accurate identification of the pollutant sources are essential in this study we seek to find out spatial ptms distribution in the coastal sediments of the persian gulf iran to assess the potential eco environmental risks and to identify the metal pollution sources total and fraction analysis indicated considerable metal zn cu mn fe al hg pb cd as cr co ni and v pollution levels albeit in most cases ptms were predominantly associated with the oxidizable and residual fractions the obtained ptms concentrations were in the range of 22 8 156 3 16 6 161 9 2 7 88 10 4 107 3 1 1 35 8 0 8 27 9 0 1 1 3 1 1 21 3 0 04 1 9 mg kg 1 for v ni cu zn cr co hg pb and cd respectively the combined ptm pca pmf modeling approach identified four main metal sources anthropogenic vehicle related agricultural and lithogenic in the study area several recognizable hot spots with extremely high metal concentrations were observed in the spatial metal pollution patterns some of those locations were predominantly affected by the nearby industrial activities while others have demonstrated contributions from several sources not only anthropogenic but also agricultural and vehicle related the same spots of elevated pollution were found to demonstrate higher potential eco environmental risk various indexes indicated more or less similar trends the eco environmental risk was gradually increasing towards the northwestern part of the study area with several peaks in the central and eastern parts directly affected by the nearby industrial activities graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords coastal ecosystem sediment spatial patterns fractionation risk assessment co occurrence network pca pmf 1 introduction the persian gulf hosts a huge variety of important natural coastal habitats such as coral reefs seagrass beds mangroves estuarine ecosystems sandy and rocky shores sharifinia et al 2019 not only do these habitats provide nutrients and shelter for various marine species they also prevent the coast from erosion and the destructive actions of storms and provide an array for fishing and recreational activities duraiappah et al 2005 sharifinia et al 2019 despite their enormous importance nearly 60 of such ecosystems have been degraded worldly duraiappah 2005 ivanov et al al 2019 rapid changes in the marine environment along the iranian coasts are reported as well sheppard et al 2010 kamrani et al 2016 ecological disturbance in this sensitive area arises in large part due to the oil related activities sharifinia et al 2018 moreover a serious threat is caused by the intense coastal habitat modification dredging infilling and conversion of shallow waters into land and urbanization sheppard et al 2010 al ghadban and price 2002 the loss or impairment of biodiversity comes hand in hand with the increasing anthropogenic activities and urbanization sharifinia et al 2019 and the coastal sediments are usually strongly affected by the aeolian and alluvial processes libes 2009 resulting in high loadings of the terrigenous matter which in turn is responsible for the intense accumulation of the land derived pollutants gao et al 2012 the polluted sediment could subsequently serve as an inner pollution source for water via resuspension wang et al 2020 ranjbar jafarabadi et al 2020 to provide a major progress in conservation of coastal and marine biodiversity management and pollution control is an urgency potentially toxic metals ptms pollution has been a growing problem for decades maghrebi et al 2018 wang et al 2020 due to their high toxicity persistence and non biodegradability arambourou et al 2020 there is a critical need to understand the spatial distribution chemical fractionation potential risk and contamination sources of metals in the marine environments ranjbar jafarabadi et al 2020 2018 lintern et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 moreover it is urgent to create strategies that could prevent or at least diminish the ptms pollution for the development of such strategies the accurate identification of pollutant sources is essential xia et al 2020 lintern et al 2016 multiple methods have been applied to qualitatively identify metal sources in sediments receptor models such as principal component analysis pca and positive matrix factorization pmf being often the preferred options duodu et al 2017 xia et al 2020 pca explains the variance of large datasets by contracting them into a set of factors with reduced dimensions salim et al 2019 ogwueleka 2014 the pmf model proposed by usepa provides qualitative source apportionment and contribution calculation of the environmental pollutants if combined with the spatial analysis pmf enables exploration of a detailed information on the factors regulating metal pollutant distribution comero et al 2014 xia et al 2020 pmf is very useful for the effective classification of the pollutants and development of the heavy metals hms remediation strategies xia et al 2020 despite numerous researches reported on hms pollution in the persian gulf only a handful of studies were dealing with the coastal sediment pollution arfaeinia et al 2019 maghrebi et al 2018 lahijanzadeh et al 2019 kazemi et al al 2012 agah et al 2012 pourang et al 2005 moreover to best of our knowledge there is a lack of the large scale studies covering broad coastal areas of the gulf the aim of this study was to determine the current status of ptms contamination in the persian gulf coastal ecosystem s sediments to pinpoint the major ptms regions with high ecological risks and find the potential pollution sources primary objectives of this research were to 1 analyze and map the ptms spatial variation at a large scale 2 reveal ptms chemical fractions and mobility 4 demonstrate the trends and patterns of eco environmental risks using geo statistics and gis 5 explore source types and quantify the proportion of various sources for each ptm using the co occurrence network and pca pmf based approaches this study provides wide pivotal information and guidance for hms pollution risk control and remediation strategies in coastal ecosystems 2 materials and methods 2 1 site descriptions and sampling points the persian gulf is a semi enclosed shallow water body with a limited water exchange sharifinia et al 2018 the unique features of the gulf such as high organic carbon content anoxic reduced conditions and high primary productivity create perfect conditions for the uptake and accumulation of various pollutants ranjbar jafarabadi et al 2020 hosting about two thirds of the world s oil sources the gulf is exposed to high risks associated with oil extraction refineries transportation and direct effluents discharge generated in coastal cities khazaali et al 2016 moreover agriculture lands urban areas and industrial centers fig 1 are located along the coast of the gulf lahijanzadeh et al 2019 in the present large scale study we seek to cover the areas of varying land use to this end 54 sampling sites were selected from the coastal area of the persian gulf fig 1 in july 2016 the sampling sites were classified based on their location hormozgan province s coastal zone hpcz pg1 pg36 bushehr province s coastal zone bpcz pg37 pg52 and khuzestan province s coastal zone kpcz pg53 pg54 sediment samples were taken from the top sediment layer 0 5 cm using a stainless steel grab sampler beneath the sediment water interface and then samples were stored on ice bag until being returned to the laboratory as soon as possible three distinct particle size fractions were separated to evaluate the influence of grain size on ptms distribution in the studied coastal sediments each grain size fraction was weighed and stored in plastic bags prior to analysis 2 2 sediment preparation a detailed description of the sediment preparation and analysis is given in the appendix section a1 distribution of particle size was conducted using a laser scattering analyzer horiba la 950v2 and detailed information has been described in our previous work ranjbar jafarabadi et al 2018 the calcium carbonate content of sediments was measured using the procedure described by muller and gastner i971 this method uses the increase in pressure produced by mixing hci with a sample contained in a carbonate bomb the organic matter om content was determined by the walkley black method faniran and areola 1978 and the chemical speciation for partitioning of trace metals into fractions was conducted as suggested by tessier et al 1979 and chao 1972 for the metal analysis samples were prepared according to saher and siddiqui 2019 descriptions of the quality control and assurance statistical analysis evaluation of the sediment contamination are reported in the appendix info sections a3 a5 3 results 3 1 coastal sediment characteristics one way anova results indicated a significant difference in toc tom bc and grain size values among the industrial and non industrial sites p 0 05 the grain size range average declined in the order of clay 8 07 96 67 81 10 silt sand in bpcz silt 1 31 91 80 13 68 clay 0 19 10 59 2 22 sand in kpcz sand 2 32 97 57 80 42 silt 0 99 97 68 12 11 and clay 0 00 20 00 7 47 in hpcz overall the contents of fine particles in the coastal zones of the persian gulf clay and silt augmented towards the west whereas an opposite trend was observed for sand fig 2 caco3 content varied from 30 to 80 in clay from 8 to 50 in silt and from 2 to 30 in sand it s content in sediment fractions was proportional to the sediment grain size the concentrations of toc and tom mg g 1 were 2 85 16 76 g kg 1 9 77 g kg 1 respectively and 2 85 16 76 g kg 1 9 77 g kg 1 in hpcz 1 50 13 49 g kg 1 9 64 g kg 1 and 2 85 16 76 g kg 1 9 77 g kg 1 in kpcz and 1 50 13 49 g kg 9 64 g kg 1 and 2 85 16 76 g kg 9 77 gkg 1 in bpcz a significant fluctuation was observed in the horizontal distribution of the toc and tom contents with spatial location for all the sites fig 2 spatially the concentrations of toc tom and bc increased towards the west of the persian gulf fig 2 ph values varied from 5 92 to 8 74 and demonstrated a complex spatial pattern in general a decreasing trend towards the west was observed with the lowest values being found in industrial stations pg35 pg36 pg44 48 pg51 54 eh varied between 397and 83 3 2 ptms concentrations in the coastal sediments one way anova f test p 0 05 revealed significant differences in the ptms concentrations along the study area the highest concentrations and a uniform spatial distribution in the coastal sediment were recorded for al mn and fe the second highest loadings were observed for v and ni their concentrations varied from 22 8 to 156 3 and from 16 6 to 161 9 respectively cu zn cr co hg pb cd concentrations were in the range of 2 7 88 10 4 107 3 1 1 35 8 0 8 27 9 0 1 1 3 1 1 21 3 0 04 1 9 mg kg respectively all of the above mentioned metals exhibited increasing loadings in the following order hpcz kpcz bpcz in contrast an increasing trend towards the east was observed for as the highest as loadings were observed in the stations pg6 pg7 and pg1 which have been characterized by relatively low loadings of the remaining metals a representative for pb pollution in three different zones of the study area is given in fig 3 for the sake of brevity such figure was only drawn for pb as drawing them for all the investigated metals would have required 10 additional figures fig 3 reveals that the highest metal loadings were observed in the sampling stations pg22 23 pg26 pg28 pg37 38 pg39 42 and pg52 54 similar spatial trends were observed for other metals except for as 3 3 determining ptm pollution sources 3 3 1 co occurrence network to assess the relationships between ptms and to detect the presence of their common sources in the study area a co occurrence network analysis was performed liu et al 2015 the co occurrence network was constructed using the spearman s correlation coefficients p 0 6 between ptms as was excluded from the co occurrence network due to its weak or insignificant correlations with the other metals the most significant co occurrence correlations were obtained between zn cd and cu fig 4 high co occurrence correlations were also observed for these three metals and ni cr and pb pb correlated also well with co v cr and showed a significant correlation with al and fe weaker albeit still significant co occurrence correlations were observed for hg and v with cu cd and pb mn has shown relatively low co occurrence correlations with all the metals except ni 3 3 2 principle component analysis pca and pmf model pca analysis is typically applied for the identification of the potential pollution sources zhi et al 2016 kang et al 2017 in addition pca analysis could be run prior to pmf modeling in order to determine the number of factors for pmf models xia et al 2020 in this study pca analysis was applied for both purposes when the pca analysis was performed with all the metals included into a dataset it resulted in 5 factors being obtained however one of them was predominantly loaded with as it could be seen from the fig 6 that as had a completely different spatial distribution pattern and was distinguished from other metals by the cluster analysis moreover arsenic did not have a significant correlation with any of the remaining metals considering this we decided to exclude as from the final pca analysis for the sake of clarity and to assume that a separate as source is present in the study area with this being done four main driving factors were identified in the study area covering 92 2 of the total variance fig 5 determining the optimum number of factors for the pmf analysis was done by readjusting the number of sources from 2 to 6 till the value of q closest to the number of degrees of freedom was obtained the number of factors providing the minimum q robust qexp value was considered as an optimum one just like in the case of pca analysis four was the optimum number of factors for the base model run as and al did not demonstrate a significant correlation between the observed and the predicted values neither were their peak values reproduced well by the model thus both al and as were determined as bad and were excluded from the model mn v and hg had more significant correlation between the observed and predicted values 0 540 0 623 and 0 497 respectively but their peak values were not well reproduced by the model in relation to that their contribution to the model was down weighted and these three metals were set as weak in the base model run the measured ptm concentrations were compared to the ones predicted by the pmf model and determination coefficients r2 were used to evaluate the efficacy of the model predictions the lowest r2 of 0 550 was recorded for fe whereas r 2 for the remaining metals were in the range of 0 769 and 1 00 the highest r 2 values were found for cu 1 00 ni 1 00 pb 1 00 and zn 0 999 and the ptm concentrations predicted by the selected source factors in the pmf model were well explained results of the pmf model analysis are summarized in fig 8 4 discusion 4 1 ptms pollution hazardous areas in the coastal ecosystem s sediments of the persian gulf metal distribution patterns in sediments are affected by environmental parameters such as organic matter content ph redox conditions to mention just a few sundaray et al 2011 spatially except for as metal concentration increased towards the north western part of the study area hpcz kpcz bpcz several recognizable hot spots hazardous areas were identified in the spatial metal pollution patterns sampling stations pg52 pg54 and pg41 pg42 fig 6 the extremely high metal concentrations observed in the kpcz hot spot sites were most likely associated with the runoff from the industrial parks located nearby in a meanwhile a more complex source to sink metal transport mechanism should be attributed to the north western part of the study area bpcz not only is this region affected by several industrial objects located nearby it is situated in the impact zone of several large cities and vast agricultural lands moreover this zone is largely affected by the river inflow pollutants collected from a broad catchment area of the tigris euphrates karun helleh hendijan and mond rivers enter the persian gulf in the northwestern part of the study area cunningham et al 2019 hence this zone is most probably affected by multiple metal pollution sources rivers atmospheric deposition and runoff from the industrial sites being the main pollution transportation routes in contrast as was characterized by an increasing trend towards the east the highest as loadings were observed in the stations pg6 pg7 and pg1 which have been characterized by relatively low loadings of the remaining metals fig 6 whereas stations pg6 and pg7 are located in the vicinity of the factories no potential pollution sources could be identified close to pg1 the distinct origin of as was further confirmed by the dual hierarchical clustering analysis which produced two main clusters where cluster 1 was attributed to as and cluster 2 to the remaining metals the cluster 2 was further sub divided into 6 sub clusters hg sub cluster 1 cd cu and cr sub cluster 2 pb al fe sub cluster 3 co v sub cluster 4 ni and zn sub cluster 5 and finally mn sub cluster 6 similar results were obtained for the iranian coral islands fig 6 whereas other metals had shown similar spatial distribution patterns as demonstrated the opposite trend ranjbar et al 2018 it indicates the presence of a separate source of arsenic in the persian gulf clay demonstrated higher ptm loadings than sand and silt this was further supported by the correlation analysis r was in the range of 0 46 and 0 75 between clay and metal concentrations p 0 005 this owes to the fact that clay is characterized by high fraction of the fine grained particles zhu et al 2019 moreover the presence of considerable content of caco3 in clay may have resulted in the increased sorbtion of metals jamshidi zanjani et al 2017 only as exhibited high concentrations in the sandy sediment with higher eh whereas clay has demonstrated high loadings of all the remaining ptms fig 7 in the sandy sediment fraction significant amount of caco3 was detected in the stations pg22 27 pg45 pg48 however caco3 content in sand did not play a prominent role in determining the metal pollution different trends were observed for silt and clay caco3 content in clay was found to play an important role in the sampling stations pg49 54 where the highest metal concentrations were recorded fig 7 carbonates are usually found to affect the distribution of cd and pb jamshidi zanjani et al 2017 in our study the highest correlation coefficients between caco3clay and metals were recorded for mn vu zn cr and cd r ranging from 0 32 to 0 46 p 0 005 the obtained results also reveal that carbonates in clay control variations of pb cd cu and cr in the sampling stations pg51 54 fig 7 whereas carbonates present in silt fraction play an important role for co and pb accumulation in the sampling stations pg22 23 fig 7 other factors such as high organic matter content are more important in the remaining sampling stations all the ptms except as showed significant affinity with tom and toc fig 7 the highest correlation coefficient was obtained between toc and al cu ni cr mn and fe r was in the range of 0 62 0 76 p 0 005 negative correlation r 0 37 was observed between as and toc for the remaining metals r was in the range of 0 49 0 56 p 0 005 organic carbon plays an important role in determining the metal distribution due to its large surface to volume ratio moreover it is also capable of forming complexes which would stabilize ptms in the sediment li et al 2019 all the ptms except as showed significant affinity with tom and toc fig 7 the highest correlation coefficient was obtained between toc and al cu ni cr mn and fe r was in the range of 0 62 0 76 p 0 005 negative correlation r 0 37 was observed between as and toc for the remaining metals r was in the range of 0 49 0 56 p 0 005 moreover it is also capable of forming complexes which would stabilize ptms in the sediment li et al 2019 the observed ptms concentrations were comparable to those detected in the coastal sediment of the persian gulf previously cu and cr loadings were similar to those recorded by arfaenia et al 2019 albeit lahijanzadeh et al 2019 has reported significantly higher levels of these two metals and the ones detected by sharifinia et al 2018 were much lower zn ni and pb demonstrated comparable loadings to the ones reported by maghrebi et al 2018 and mirza et al 2019 ni and pb levels were also comparable to those detected by lahijanzadeh et al 2019 table 1 as and co levels were also comparable to those observed by lahijanzadeh et al 2019 in a meantime cd concentrations were lower than the ones detected by arfaenia et al 2019 sharifinia et al 2018 and bastami et al 2015 but higher than those reported by lahijanzadeh et al 2019 maghrebi et al 2018 and mirza et al 2019 table 1 if compared to the studies conducted on the coral reefs of the persian gulf ranjbar et al 2020 2018 ptms loadings were significantly higher in the coastal sediment 4 2 pmf dynamics and identification of ptms pollution sources in our study high co occurrence correlations among the metals were obtained indicating the presence of common metal sources in the study area xia et al 2020 the highest co occurrence correlations were found between zn cd cu ni cr and pb revealing their common anthropogenic origin liu et al 2015 and xia et al 2020 have found high co occurrence correlations between pb zn cu ni and cr in the industrial sites characterized by highly complex human induced processes in agreement with that elevated concentrations of cu pb cd and zn were reported to originate from anthropogenic activities yu et al 2010 ranjbar et al 2020 mehr et al 2019 hu et al 2019 cunningham et al 2019 on the other hand fe and al are often used as the reference parameters to distinguish between the natural background and human induced pollution sources liu et al 2015 woods et al 2012 strong co occurrence correlation between al fe and the selected heavy metal would be indicative of its natural origin liu et al 2015 the potential industrial source pollutants zn cd cu and ni showed rather weak correlations with the reference items fe al indicating their human induced sources liu et al 2015 in a meanwhile pb and cr demonstrated both high correlations with the anthropogenic metals zn cd cu ni and high association with the reference metals al and fe which could mean their contribution to multiple sources part of cr and pb might be associated with the mineral lattice while some of the loading might arise from the human activities industrial processes vehicles agriculture liu et al 2015 pca analysis distinguished four main driving factors in the study area f1 was heavily loaded with cu cr pb cd co and was assumed to represent the local anthropogenic sources fig 5 f2 was prevailed by pb cd cu and zn and had a minor contribution of ni and cr we assumed that this component could be related to the vehicle activities and parking lots cu and cd are known to be used for car tires production while ni zn are used in automotive lubricants and pb pollution is often associated with the motorways salim et al 2019 the third component was characterized by high loadings of co and cd which have demonstrated rather weak co occurrence correlation fig 4 with the other metals the fourth component was heavily loaded with hg fig 5 this was consistent with the cluster analysis results hg was separated from the block of other elements revealing its distinct origin pmf modeling analysis gave different results than those observed by pca factor 1 demonstrated high contribution of cu 48 ni 49 and cd 49 the values given in the brackets represent the factor contribution on each metal whereas metal contributions to each factor can be seen in fig 8 ni is widely applied as an automotive lubricant while cu and cd are used in the car tire production and thus their presence in the sediment could be attributed to the vehicle brake emissions salim et al 2019 hwang et al 2016 high content of ptms in the urban coastal sediments of the persian gulf were attributed to the intense traffic of vehicle related activities runoff from the roads car repair shops and the gas stations degradation of tires and brakes arfaeinia et al 2019 speaking of the spatial f1 loadings its highest contribution was observed in the northwestern part of the study area pg39 pg54 in addition to several industrial objects located in the area it also contains large urban populations centers such as mahshahr and bandar e eman cities rastegari mehr et al 2019 moreover this zone is largely affected by the river inflow rivers are known to be the main transportation route for the vehicle related contaminants heavy metals originating from vehicles are deposited in the ambient environment and stay at the surficial soil layer or other nearby surfaces during the dry periods but stormwater runoff carries the deposited contaminants into the local receiving waters such as lakes ponds streams rivers and bays hwang et al 2016 dash et al 2020 pollutants collected from a broad catchment area of the tigris euphrates karun helleh hendijan and mond rivers enter the persian gulf in the northwestern part of the study area cunningham et al 2019 taking all of the above into account f1 was attributed to the vehicle related emission from the roadways and parking lots factor 2 demonstrated high loading of pb 63 cd 45 cr 39 co 39 and significant loadings of hg 28 and cu 28 the usage of leaded petrol burning of fossil fuel and the maritime traffic pb is utilized in the production of antifouling paints are named as the main sources of anthropogenic pb ranjbar et al 2020 mehr et al 2019 farag et al 2006 arfaeinia et al 2019 reported high pb and cu loadings in the northern part of the persian gulf and suggested that industrial combustion processes are responsible for such a trend whereas lahijanzadeh et al 2019 named mining activities industrial effluents metal processing units distillery units landfill leachates urban storm water fly ash of coal powered plants as the main sources of copper in the musa estuary the wastewater of the petrochemical companies paper dyeing and printing are among the main sources of hg pollution rastegari mehr et al 2019 cr pollution is closely related to the textile industry whereas cd is known to be mainly originating from the mining activities and refining of the non ferrous metal deposits hu et al 2019 cunningham et al 2019 the intense maritime traffic in the area should also contribute significantly to f2 farag et al 2006 all of the above suggest that f2 represents the local anthropogenic impact in agreement with that f2 played the most significant role in the sampling stations pg3 pg5 pg22 pg23 pg26 pg28 pg37 pg42 pg 52 pg54 fig 5 most of these stations are known to be affected by the intense industrial activities pg 22 pg 28 pg37 pg42 pg 52 pg54 in a meanwhile sampling stations pg3 pg 5 are located near the hormuz island and are affected by the tourism fishing and indigenous activities factor 3 was heavily loaded with zn 58 and was characterized by a significant contribution of cr 51 and cu 30 cuso4 used as a fungicide for fruits is a well known agricultural source of cu whereas zinc is used in the production of fungicides that are applied to crops and vegetables wu et al 2019 based on this we assumed that the third factor could be attributed to the agriculture this was only objected by the considerable loadings of chromium on the 3rd component cr is known to predominantly originate from the industrial activities ertani et al 2017 on the other hand sewage irrigation and sludge application for agriculture is a common practice in many countries wu et al 2019 ertani et al 2017 guan et al 2018 moreover significant cr loadings were observed by arfaeinia et al 2019 in the coastal sediments surrounded by agricultural lands northern persian gulf considering this high cr concentration recorded in the study area could be agriculture related despite the fact that its primary source should be of anthropogenic origin in addition to the high cr concentrations being observed arfaeinia et al 2019 has also reported high levels of zn and cu in the agricultural lands in the northern part of the persian gulf lahijanzadeh et al 2019 has suggested that some of the copper found in the sediment of musa estuary persian gulf might originate from the agricultural waste disposal fertilizers poultry sewage and compost a study by hu et al 2018 revealed large heavy metal loadings in the soil of agricultural regions in china which could be related to the use of various fertilizers and irrigation with contaminated water the assumption that factor 3 might be attributed to the agriculture was further confirmed by its spatial distribution trends they were similar to those observed for f1 a steady increase towards the northwestern part of the study area this zone is not only affected by the industrial activities and urban runoff it is also surrounded by the agricultural lands rastegari mehr et al 2019 arfaeinia et al 2019 and the large riverine input is the main route of the agriculture derived pollution in the northwestern part of the persian gulf ertani et al 2017 the fourth factor was attributed to the lithogenic heavy metal sources it was heavily loaded with fe 50 and mn 52 and had significant loadings of ni 42 zn 35 and v 39 high loadings of these metals are indicative of the natural soil parent materials which can be deposited in the sediment column through natural processes such as erosion weathering from the nearby areas dash et al 2020 guan et al 2018 relatively homogeneous spatial distribution pattern was exhibited by this factor stations located in the industrial parks did not demonstrate significantly increased loadings for f4 confirming the natural origin of these metals 4 3 eco environmental risk assessment 4 3 1 chemical fractionation and rac in the marine environment heavy metals tend to exist in a form of exchangeable carbonate bound reducible oxidizable or residual fraction kang et al 2017 zaaboub et al 2015 in this study derived metal fractions are presented in fig 9 al and mn were predominantly found in the residual f5 fraction elements accumulated in this fraction are not available for bio uptake as they are bounded within the silicate mineral lattices while the non residual fractions could participate in the biochemical reactions under favorable conditions zaaboub et al 2015 kang et al 2017 surprisingly fe did not demonstrate high loadings on f5 and was predominantly found at the reducible f3 fraction the same trend was observed for zn v was predominantly loaded on f4 as cr hg cd and cu demonstrated high loadings on both oxidizable f4 and residual f5 fractions whereas co pb ni and cr have also demonstrated occasional high loadings on f3 elevated proportions of exchangeable metals were observed in the sampling stations with higher anthropogenic input pg3 pg5 pg20 pg22 pg23 pg26 pg28 pg37 pg42 pg52 pg54 elements detected in the labile exchangeable fraction are often classified as the anthropogenic ones ji et al 2019 nazneen et al 2019 they enter the environment in a form of inorganic complexes or hydrate ions and are readily absorbed onto the sediment fine particles nazneen et al 2019 it was observed by several authors that the metal content in the mobile fraction increases with the increasing level of anthropogenic contamination tang et al 2015 ji et al 2019 xia et al 2020 exchangeable fraction is defined as the one posing the highest potential adverse biological effects due to its high lability and bioavailability while carbonate fraction is also generally accepted to have a direct effect on the marine biota świetlik et al 2015 the two remaining mobile fractions f3 and f4 are considered to be less dangerous forms świetlik et al 2015 in order to gain a deeper insight into the sediment toxicity and elements mobility risk assessment code was applied sundaray et al 2011 zhang et al 2017 based on the obtained rac values co cr and hg posed low to medium risk to the aquatic biota of the study area fig 10 as cd ni possessed low to high risk while pb and v have demonstrated occasional cases of a very high risk stations pg21 pg 27 pg 29 pg 30 from the hpcz and posed low to high risk in the remaining area the results are in agreement with other studies held in the persian gulf area as cd and cu were also found to pose moderate environmental risk by neyestani et al 2016 whereas ranjbar et al 2018 determined an elevated risk of v ni and cd and an occasional moderate risk of pb in the iranian coral reef islands in a most recent study of our group even higher rac values were obtained mn v ni cu and cr were found to pose a very high risk whereas pb cd as and hg demonstrated a high risk in the surficial sediment layer of the iranian coral islands fig 10 ranjbar et al 2020 in general all the elements posed a medium risk throughout the study area with some relatively safe regions of low risk and several local hot spots elevated rac values for as pb ni and v were observed in the northwestern part of the study area pg52 pg54 as v and ni have also demonstrated increased rac values in the stations pg3 pg5 and pg37 pg42 hotspots for pb were identified in the zones around pg3 pg10 pg22 pg30 and pg41 pg42 4 3 2 enrichment and contamination factors of all the metals analyzed cd has demonstrated the highest ef values and was followed by hg ni and cu fig a1 in the most affected sites ef values for cd reached 40 and indicated a very high enrichment even though the highest ef values for hg were twice lower around 22 they still did correspond to a very high enrichment the highest ef values for ni and cu were found to be 14 and 12 respectively and corresponded to a significant enrichment the remaining metals have demonstrated minimal to moderate enrichment comparable results were demonstrated in the persian gulf area by hyperlink l bib31 mehr et al 2019 mirza et al 2019 and lahijanzadeh et al 2019 sediment was the most heavily enriched with hg cd and ni indicating the impact of anthropogenic activities keshavarzi et al 2018 cf values for pb zn mn fe al as cr fell within the range of low pollution fig a2 the highest cf values for v cu co and ni corresponded to moderate pollution cf for hg corresponded to a considerable contamination at some points whereas cf values for cd in the most polluted sites were above 6 which classifies these zones as heavily polluted hakanson 1980 both cf and ef values have demonstrated similar spatial distribution trends varying between individual metals fig a1 fig a2 a unique spatial distribution pattern was attributed to as the highest cf and ef values being observed in the eastern part of the study area for the remaining metals the two factor values were increasing towards the north western part of the study area cu ni cr fe mn and zn have demonstrated similar patterns with the most polluted sites being recognized in the north western part of the study area stations pg51 pg54 medium levels in the central part and the lowest pollution in the eastern part the same was also true for cd and co except that they have also demonstrated high ef and cf values around the stations pg37 pg42 figs a1 a2 for hg v and pb both the north western and the central parts of the study area were identified as the mostly polluted sites 4 3 3 overall metal pollution effects metal pollution index and nemerow synthetic pollution index have demonstrated similar spatial pattern in both cases the hotspots were identified in the zones of the sampling stations pg51 54 and pg37 pg42 severe contamination with hms was observed in these regions han et al 2018 the central part of the study area has been slightly to moderately contaminated han et al 2018 whereas eastern part of the area was classified as non contaminated an obvious trend was observed for the m ermq values in the study area they were gradually increasing towards the north western part of the persian gulf fig 8 stations pg1 pg25 hpcz were attributed to the lowest priority sites pg51 pg54 bpzc and kpzc were characterized as high medium priority sites whereas the remaining stations in the central zone bpzc of the study area could be described as medium low priority sites similar trends were demonstrated by the metal risk index its highest values corresponding to a very high risk above 600 zhu et al 2012 were observed in the north western part of the study area stations pg51 pg54 bpzc and kpzc and were gradually decreasing towards east however differently from the previously described index occasional local zones of considerable risk were observed in the central part bpzc of the study area pg37 pg42 the eastern part of the study area hpzc was mainly characterized as an area of a low risk albeit several spots with elevated mri pg3 pg5 moderate risk have been observed 5 conclusion coastal sediments along the persian gulf were considerably contaminated by ptms which resulted in potential risks to aquatic ecosystems as it was indicated by various indices v and ni concentrations in the sediment varied from 22 8 to 156 3 and from 16 6 to 161 9 mg kg 1 respectively cu zn cr co hg pb cd concentrations were in the range of 2 7 88 10 4 107 3 1 1 35 8 0 8 27 9 0 1 1 3 1 1 21 3 0 04 1 9 mg kg 1 respectively as pb ni and v have demonstrated high ecological risk due to a high proportion in the bioavailable fractions however cd has demonstrated the highest ef values and was followed by hg ni and cu cd and hg were also identified as the main risk drivers based on the cf values mpi and npi based evaluation revealed several hotspots of the study area which were localized around the sampling stations pg37 pg42 central part and pg51 54 northern part mri and m ermq values were gradually increasing towards the north western part of the persian gulf four main metal sources were identified in the study area by the pca pmf approach whereas lithogenic sources showed more or less uniform spatial distribution agricultural and vehicle related metal sources have demonstrated a steadily increasing trend towards the north western part of the study area which is largely affected by the riverine inflow in a meanwhile anthropogenic sources mainly impacted the identified ptms pollution hotspots located as a rule close to the industrial objects this study provided metal pollution data on a large scale covering a vast region along the coast of the persian gulf the obtained results are important for the development of the source control and remediation strategies for the effective conservation of coastal and marine biodiversity table 1 declaration of

17421,biofiltration systems can help mitigate the impact of urban runoff as they can treat retain and attenuate stormwater it is important to select the optimal design characteristics of biofilters e g vegetation filter media depth to ensure high treatment performance operational conditions e g infiltration rate can also lead to significant changes in biofilter treatment performance over time the impact of specific operational conditions on water quality treatment performance of stormwater biofilters is still not well understood furthermore despite the importance of design characteristics and operational conditions on biofilter treatment performance there is a lack of models that can be used to determine the optimal design and operation in this paper we developed a series of statistical models to predict the total phosphorus tp and total nitrogen tn removal performance of stormwater biofilters using various numbers of design characteristics and operational conditions these statistical models were tested using data collected from four extensive laboratory scale biofilter column studies it was found that all models performed relatively well with a nash sutcliffe efficiency nse of 0 42 0 61 for tp and 0 37 0 63 for tn the most important design characteristics were filter media type and depth for tp treatment and vegetation type and submerged zone depth for tn treatment in addition infiltration rate and inflow concentrations were the operational conditions that greatly influence outflow tp and tn concentrations from stormwater biofilters as such these variables need to be carefully considered when designing and operating stormwater biofilters sensitivity analysis results indicate that the model was quite sensitive to all regression coefficients and intercepts additional modelling exercises show that the model could be further simplified by reducing the number of cross correlated parameters these models can be used by practitioners for not just optimising the design but also operating biofilters using real time monitoring and control to achieve optimum performance graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords treatment hierarchical model nutrients data driven infiltration rate 1 introduction urban stormwater is a major contributor to the declining health of waterways changes to catchment hydrology as a result of urbanisation often leads to the physical degradation of urban streams and activities in urban areas generate pollutants that are carried into receiving water bodies by stormwater mcgrane 2016 the increase in the pollutants in streams can lead to eutrophication and reduced aquatic biodiversity stormwater biofilters also known as bioretention systems or rain gardens developed under the concept of water sensitive urban design also known as low impact development sustainable urban drainage systems fletcher et al 2015 are becoming one of the most popular technologies to control and treat polluted urban stormwater at or near its source payne et al 2019 biofilters typically consist of a vegetated basin or a trench containing soil or sand based media that subjects stormwater inflows to a number of treatment processes such as sedimentation fine filtration adsorption and biological uptake li and davis 2009 these systems are able to reduce the concentrations of typical stormwater pollutants while also being very versatile and relatively easy to fit into the urban landscape e g davis et al 2009 passeport et al 2009 water quality treatment and pollutant removal by biofilters largely depend on their design configurations e g afrooz and boehm 2017 dagenais et al 2018 muerdter et al 2018 bratieres et al 2008 found that due to the large number of physical and bio chemical processes involved in the removal of nutrients the selection of a few critical design characteristics such as vegetation and filter media type is required for effective nutrient removal others have reported similar findings for example several studies showed that total phosphorus tp removal varied widely with filter media type hsieh and davis 2005 hunt et al 2006 while henderson et al 2007 reported that total nitrogen tn outflow concentrations ranged from 6 09 mg l for non vegetated gravel filters to 1 23 mg l for vegetated loam filters 12 and 77 reduction respectively in addition inclusion of a submerged anoxic zone sz has been shown to improve the nitrogen removal performance by enhancing denitrification and providing a temporary reservoir for longer detention of water and support of plants and microbial communities during dry periods afrooz and boehm 2017 while optimised design configurations are important performance of stormwater biofilters may still vary substantially over time depending on the operational conditions for example many researchers e g hatt et al 2007 afrooz and boehm 2017 found that prolonged dry periods can have an adverse impact on biofilter treatment performance due to the reduced function of the plants and microbial communities and the creation of macropores in the filter media through root dieback leading to higher infiltration rates and preferential flow paths this effect however can be mitigated to some extent by the inclusion of submerged zones in the system design wang et al 2018 hydraulic loading has also been observed to impact system performance high hydraulic loading can lead to higher outflow pollution levels due to reduced detention and thus treatment time bratieres et al 2008 moreover higher infiltration rates which depends on the filter media properties presence of macropores formed due to long dry periods or the use of coarse rooted vegetation can also lead to poor performance due to the lower residence time for pollution removal le coustumer et al 2009 however contradictory results were presented by mohanty and boehm 2014 who observed that biofilter treatment performance in microbes is not greatly affected by infiltration rates the contradictory findings indicate that more studies are necessary to explore the impact of operational conditions on biofilter treatment performance this is especially important when the treated stormwater from biofilters is considered for re use due to potential health consequences while there are numerous studies looking into biofilter treatment performance there is a paucity of models that can predict biofiltration treatment performance most of the available models deal with the hydrologic balance of biofiltration systems or infiltration systems in general with water treatment included as conceptual models such as first order decay like in swmm rossman 2010 or music ewater 2014 water quality in terms of particulate capture is included in the process based model developed by li and davis 2008 randelovic et al 2016 developed a process based stormwater biofilter treatment model to simulate different removal processes of organic micropollutants one major drawback of these physically based models is the need for data for simulations which may not be easily available and also the difficulties in model calibration due to the fact that we often lack the data needed for calibration khan et al 2013 more recently data driven approaches have been used to establish relationships between biofilter performance and a range of input variables for example khan et al 2013 developed general linear regression models with nine different predictors to predict biofilter hydrological performance in terms of pollution treatment performance general linear models have been applied to understand the relationship between inflow and outflow nutrient concentrations for 11 biofilters mcnett et al 2011 in a more recent study wang et al 2019 used machine learning methods to investigate biofilter pollutant removal efficiency with a large range of design features however they did not take into account operational conditions of biofilter despite the evidence indicating the important role that operational conditions play in pollutant removal efficiency by stormwater biofilters le coustumer et al 2009 afrooz and boehm 2017 in addition the operational conditions are often not fully reported making it very difficult to perform data driven modelling approaches therefore there is a need to build on data driven studies but with an increased emphasis on including operational conditions in the models this would not onlyimprove model performance but also offer a proper and better understanding of their impact on biofilter performance this study aims to fill this gap by developing a series of statistical models of stormwater biofilter treatment performance using a data driven modelling approach the novelty in this approach lies in the fact that both design characteristics static factors and operational conditions dynamic factors were included in the statistical models dynamic factors have been rarely considered in previous stormwater biofilter models e g wang et al 2019 three innovative and different model structures single level and multi level were proposed these types of models have been previously used to identify the important explanatory variables that predict stream water quality guo et al 2020 identify key factors affecting stream bank erosion vietz et al 2018 and predict spatio temporal trends in macroinvertebrate levels in urban streams webb and king 2009 but have not been applied in stormwater biofilter studies yet in this study we focus on the removal of tp and tn four extensive laboratory experimental data sets representing a rare and important resource for such an analysis are used to develop and validate the data driven models the specific objectives of this paper are to understand the impact of design characteristics vegetation filter media type and depth submerged zone presence and operational conditions antecedent dry weather periods inflow flux inflow concentrations and infiltration rate on tp and tn removal performance to determine which and how many design and operational variables are needed to predict system performance and to develop a series of statistical models to design and operate stormwater biofilters for optimal nutrient removal the findings from this study provide insight into how operational conditions affect the pollutant removal performance of stormwater biofilters this will enable us to consider operational conditions as part of the design process but also implement real time control strategies to optimise system operation and ensure optimal tp and tn removal performance for both the health of receiving waterways and stormwater re use 2 method 2 1 data collection four large comprehensive laboratory column experiments conducted at monash university table 1 over the past 15 years provide the extensive dataset of stormwater biofilter pollutant removal performance used to undertake this analysis these datasets were selected because they recorded a range of key design and operational variables also all four studies used similar and consistent approaches to constructing and setting up the columns this helps us to eliminate other potential confounding factors during the modelling process the whole dataset comprised a total of 85 different biofilter designs covering typical recommended biofilter designs e g payne et al 2015 and centre for watershed protection 2009 53 sampling events with event mean concentrations emcs of inflow and outflow for tn and tp and a total of 3 904 observations refer to table s1 of the supplementary materials for details of the design and operational characteristics the details of the four experiments can be found in previously published papers table 1 and as such are only briefly explained below 2 1 1 design study 1 a laboratory scale column study was conducted to assess the influence of three biofilter design characteristics vegetation filter media type filter media depth and two operational conditions inflow concentration and inflow volume on biofilter treatment performance in total there were 24 design configurations each with five replicates the columns were tested using semi synthetic stormwater prepared using sediments from stormwater ponds and chemicals which had target concentrations typical of urban runoff tp 0 35 mg l and tn 2 1 mg l taylor et al 2005 each column was dosed twice a week and following a six month establishment period inflow and outflow water quality samples were collected approximately every seven weeks over 16 months 2 1 2 design study 2 a total of 245 columns with five replicates of each design were tested in this study the two key design factors tested in this study were vegetation type and presence and submerged zone presence or absence dosing frequency and hydraulic loading were also tested as operational factors the columns were dosed with semi synthetic stormwater twice a week the experiment lasted for 12 months and 14 dosing events were sampled infiltration rates were measured every three months and six infiltration rate measurements were taken during the experiment 2 1 3 dry weather study 1 in this laboratory study seven types of biofilter designs with five replicates each were tested for tp and tn removal two design factors filter media type and vegetation type and two operational factors dosing frequency and dosing volume were tested after a seven week column establishment period the columns were dosed with semi synthetic stormwater twice a week under normal operational conditions with target tp and tn concentrations of 0 37 mg l and 2 5 mg l respectively during the 36 week experiment the columns were subjected to one two and four weeks of extended drying as well as three challenge events where stormwater dosing volumes were double of what was usually applied nineteen sampling events were conducted in total infiltration rates were also measured at every sampling event as per chandrasena et al 2014 2 1 4 dry weather study 2 five different design configurations were tested in this study with five replicates each two design factors filter media type and vegetation type and three operational conditions dosing frequency dosing volume infiltration rate was tested after a seven week establishment phase columns were dosed twice a week with semi synthetic stormwater over a period of 45 weeks 15 sampling events were conducted in these four studies all water quality samples were analysed for tp and tn using standard methods hosomi and sudo 1986 apha awwa wpcf 1998 at national association of testing authorities nata accredited http www nata asn au laboratories 2 2 data preparation four biofilter key design variables and four operational variables table 2 were included in the statistical modelling all of them were previously reported to influence biofilter treatment performance e g mohanty and boehm 2014 afrooz and boehm 2017 dagenais et al 2018 chandrasena et al 2019 muerdter et al 2020 the type of plant species as well as filter media type were converted into binary values 1 or 0 to represent effective or non effective types respectively detailed information with regards to plant and media types e g effective or non effective as well as the statistics of numerical data values covered in the four different datasets are summarised in table s1 of the supplementary materials it should be noted that in some studies only 1 2 values of a particular variables were studied e g dry weather study 2 by chandrasena et al 2019 had a constant filter media depth of 0 40 m thus it was necessary to combine all of the four different datasets to have a range of values for different design or operational variables all numerical data i e excluding veg and fm were log transformed to ensure better symmetry in the distributions of the data to meet the assumptions of linear regression 2 3 proposed statistical model structures three statistical model structures were proposed as a way to conceptualise the impact of design factors and operational conditions on the treatment performance of stormwater biofilters as shown in table 3 model 1 variability around the mean model assumes that outflow concentration c outi j is modelled with a mean outflow concentration determined by specific system design j o u t f l o w j and a noise caused by real time operational conditions at time i δoutflow i j model 2 operational conditions model is a multi level hierarchical model which assumes outflow concentration at time i for design j c outi j is a linear function of operational variables adwp ir flux and c in with the regression coefficients aj bj cj and dj determined by the design characteristics of each system i e veg fm fmd and szd model 3 design characteristics model is another multi level model with the same structure as model 2 but with the design characteristics being the main variables in the model and the operational conditions determining the regression coefficients 2 4 model development and testing calibration and validation for each model structure we created all possible combinations of design factors and operational conditions to i investigate how different variables impact the treatment performance of biofilters and ii identify the model structures and the combination of design and operational variables that best predict outflow concentrations of tp and tn from stormwater biofilters for example if only adwp and fm are to be included in model 2 then the specific model will be c outi j int aj adwpi j and aj inta xa fmi j as there were four design characteristics total combinations c 4 1 c 4 2 c 4 3 c 4 4 15 and four operational conditions for each pollutant also 15 combinations this led to the development of 15 15 225 models for each pollutant and each model structure i e in total 2 pollutants 3 structures 225 models 1350 models a 5 fold calibration and validation approach was used to fit and rigorously test the 1350 models i e randomly selecting 80 data from the full datasets for model calibration and using the remaining 20 for validation the process was repeated five times to ensure the robustness of testing the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 for c out was used as performance indicator for calibration and validation python 3 7 and the function scipy optimize minimise in the sicpy package was adopted for parameter optimisation this package has also been applied in previous stormwater modelling studies selbig and fienen 2012 scipy optimize minimise minimises the objective function in this case nse value to maximise nse value using user defined optimisation methods e g bfgs nerlder mead powerll cg etc for details please refer to the documentation of the function at docs scipy org starting from an intial guess of parameter values preliminary modelling exercises were performed to select an optimisation method and initial model parameter values it was found that model performance was not sensitive to the selection of optimisation method or initial parameter values with the maximum nse values across all different combinations only differing slightly 5 thus for the full model runs i e five fold calibration and validation the default optimisation method bfgs was selected and initial regression coefficient values were all set to zero the biofilter design characteristics and operational conditions with the greatest predictive power were identified in two ways firstly from the results of the 5 fold calibration and validation the best performing combination of design characteristics and operational variables for each of the three model structures were extracted based on nse values this included the best performing models with one design and one operational variable termed as bo1 two design and two operational variables bo2 three design characteristics and three operational conditions bo3 and four design characteristics and four operational conditions bo4 i e four models were extracted for each of the three model structures in totaltwelve models secondly the contribution of each design characteristic and operational condition in improving the predictive performance of the statistical models was identified by evaluating the average drop in nse when the variables were not included in the models regardless of the number of predictors included in the model compared to when they were included in the models both of these methods were used to identify the design characteristics and operational conditions that are factors with the highest predictive performance of tp and tn removal performance using two methods enabled us to identify the most important predictors in a robust way 2 5 model uncertainty analysis model uncertainty analysis was conducted using the optimum models for tp and tn in terms of the specific number of predictors included and the statistical model structure type observed based on the results of 5 fold calibration and validation as such uncertainty analysis was conducted on one tp model and one tn model the glue method beven and binley 1992 was applied using 80 of the dataset randomly selected to understand the sensitivities of all model regression coefficients with their values sampled from uniform distributions informed by their calibrated values from the 5 fold calibration and validation the coefficient sensitivity matrix was generated using all the model runs with nse 0 0 i e indicating the model performed better than if average values were studied in this study an acceptability threshold of nse 0 45 highest average nse value 5 fold calibration validation was used to define behavioural model runs which were then used to generate prediction uncertainties for the remaining 20 of the dataset 3 results and discussion 3 1 data driven predictive models 3 1 1 comparing model structures the results of 5 fold calibration and validation of twelve statistical models had minimal variability in their model selection criterion and objective functions nses as shown in table 4 the standard deviations in nses between the multiple calibration and validation runs were between 0 002 and 0 028 in addition the nses of the validations were similar to those of the calibration runs these results suggest that the calibration and validation of these models are relatively robust using the nse as the criterion model performance is generally highest for model 2 the operational conditions model for tp and for model 3 the design characteristics model for tn while model 1 the variability around the mean model always had considerably lower performance for both pollutants table 4 however it appears that the nses do not vary largely between the operational conditions model and design characteristics model table 4 for example the percentage difference in nse between bo1 of the two models were 0 003 for tp and 9 3 for tn and between bo4 of the two models were even lower at 0 2 for tp and 0 8 for tn this suggests that from a model conceptualisation perspective table 3 having the operational variables influence how the design characteristics impact treatment performance predicts the stormwater biofilter treatment performance i e model 3 is similar to conceptually having the design characteristics influence how the biofilter treatment performance responds to operational conditions i e model 2 therefore as long as the most important design and operational parameters are considered detailed in section below both structures either model 2 or model 3 perform similarly 3 1 2 important design characteristics and operational variables to include in data driven biofilter treatment models table 4 provides the design characteristics and operational variables included in the best performing bo1 bo2 bo3 and bo4 models the models containing all design characteristics and operational conditions as predictors i e bo4 had the highest performance according to nse except model 1 in which bo4 was 3 lower than bo3 due to the slight variance across the five different calibration and validation steps this is to be expected due to the fact that nse does not penalise for increased model complexity dawson and wilby 2001 it should be noted however that the greatest increase in nse for both tp and tn and for all the three model structures occurred when the number of predictors was increased from one design and operational variable to two design characteristics and operational conditions table 4 there was a 12 25 increase in nse for tp and a 26 30 increase in nse for tn with this increase in the number of predictors from bo1 to bo2 this suggests that whilst it would be ideal to develop statistical predictive models of biofilter treatment performance using all four design characteristics and operational conditions if data for several of these variables are not available using two design characteristics and operational conditions can also result in good model predictive performance as an example comparison of the observed tp and tn outflow concentrations against tp and tn concentrations modelled using the operational conditions model and design characteristics models for both bo2 and bo4 indicates that models have relatively good performance regardless of whether there are two or four variables included in the model fig 1 therefore for the sake of brevity most of the following discussion of the variables included in the models will be done for the bo2 design characteristics models for tn and bo2 operational conditions models for tp as these had the most optimal performance according to change in nse but also relatively low levels of complexity 3 2 impact of design characteristics and operational conditions 3 2 1 design characteristics the most important variables in statistically predicting the stormwater biofilter treatment performance were consistent across different model structures as shown in fig 2 which indicates the average drops in nse when certain variables were excluded from the models the nse values indicate that the design variable that influenced tp treatment performance the most was filter media depth fmd had a 20 24 increase in nse when fmd was included followed by filter media type fm had a 20 24 increase in nse when fm was included fig 2a this had good agreement to the bo2 models for tp which always include fmd and fm as predictors table 4 this was arguably expected as a number of studies have shown that the physical filtration of tp from stormwater as it moves through the stormwater biofilter as well as sorption of phosphorus to filter media are essential for tp removal davis 2007 roy poirier et al 2010 liu and davis 2014 the regression coefficients for fmd average 0 849 fig 3 in the design characteristics model for tp shows that generally deeper fmd led to lower outflow concentrations in addition the phosphorus content of filter media has previously been found to have a strong influence on phosphorus leaching from stormwater biofilters hatt et al 2009 shrestha et al 2018 indeed the results of this study showed that sandy media that has relatively low organic matter and phosphorus content assigned as binary value 1 was more efficient in removing tp than were non effective media binary value 0 this is further reflected by the negative regression coefficient values of fm average 1 26 fig 3a for tn vegetation type was found to be the design variable that most strongly influenced its treatment performance with a 25 28 increase in nse from 0 32 to 0 43 when vegetation type was included in the models fig 2b the importance of vegetation presence and type for tn removal is well recognised nitrogen can be removed by plant uptake and microbial processes enhanced by the rhizosphere within stormwater biofilter systems read et al 2010 payne et al 2014c glaister et al 2017 the regression coefficients for vegetation in the tn design characteristics model are always negative average 1 0 fig 3b indicating that poor performing vegetation treatments e g non vegetated systems or dianella revoluta binary value 0 table s1 in the supplementary materials lead to a net increase in tn concentrations leaving the stormwater biofilter submerged zone depth szd was the second most important design variable for tn removal with a 14 16 increase in nse from 0 35 to 0 42 when szd was included fig 2b this was expected as the presence of a submerged zone has been found in many studies to have an important influence on the removal of nitrogen via denitrification and the survival of vegetation through extended dry periods chandrasena et al 2014 payne et al 2014c the szd regression coefficients in the tn design characteristics model are also always negative which indicates that deeper submerged zone depths lead to lower tn outflow concentrations fig 3b these results were in good agreement with the identified bo2 models for tn which always included the vegetation and szd as the two predictors table 4 3 2 2 operational conditions infiltration rate ir was found to be the operational condition that is most important for predicting both tp and tn removal in stormwater biofilters in both the design characteristics model and the operational conditions model as shown in fig 2 the nse increased by 84 87 from 0 24 to 0 48 for tp and by 45 50 from 0 30 to 0 46 for tn when the ir was included in the statistical models the regression coefficients for ir fig 3c d indicate that an increase in ir results in an increase in tp and tn outflow concentrations from the biofilter decreased hydrological residence time in the stormwater biofilter has been hypothesised to result in decreased sorption of soluble phosphorus to filter media roy poirier et al 2010 similar findings were observed by davis et al 2006 the second most important operational condition for predicting both tp and tn treatment performance by stormwater biofilters is inflow concentration cin on average 8 increase in nse when cin is included in the models fig 2 this is suprising as bratieres et al 2008 previously found that cin did not have big influence on outflow concentrations for tp and tn davis et al 2006 however observed that there is a predefined removal rate of nutrients in biofilters and high cin results in higher outflow concentrations in this study this relationship is demonstrated in the positive regression coefficients calculated for cin in the operational conditions model for both tp and for tn fig 3c d it should be noted that adwp was not found to be an important predictor of tp and tn removal performance by stormwater biofilters this contrasts with previous studies where an adwp of about 2 4 weeks could result in considerable deterioration in biofilter treatment performance hatt et al 2008 blecken et al 2009 payne et al 2014b it is hypothesised that the statistical modelling exercise did not identify adwp as an important predictor of biofilter treatment performance because the underlying dataset used to build the statistical models included few datapoints with extended dry periods of 2 to 4 weeks table s1 in supplementary materials we do not believe that this compromises the modelling exercise as previous studies have shown that the 50th percentile of dry periods in south east australia is 4 4 days and the 50th percentile for dry periods in our underlying dataset was 3 0 days zhang 2015 indicating the datasets used in this study represents realistic conditions 3 3 regression coefficient sensitivity and model predictions uncertainties results of the sensitivity analysis of the tp operational conditions model bo2 shown in fig 4 indicate that the model is quite sensitive to the fitted model regression coefficients and intercepts similar findings were observed for the tn design characteristics model bo3 figure s1 of the supplementary material it appears that deviating from the optimal regression coefficient and intercept values can lead to a substantial drop in model performance furthermore fig 4 indicates that when regression coefficients are randomly sampled from uniform distributions model performance could deteriorate substantially a symptom of low parameter identifiability whilst the average model outputs with log transformation are in line with observed data fig 5 there is the potential for some of the extreme model outputs 2 5th or 97 5th percentile to vary substantially from the observed data figure s2 of the supplementary material as such the sensitivity analysis emphasises the need for using good quality pre cleaned data to fit the regression coefficients and the intercepts there are also high cross correlations between regression coefficients of the parameters included in the optimal tp treatment performance models and also optimal tn models shown in figure s1 this was not unexpected due to the large number of regression coefficients and the data driven approach that was applied for model testing it was hard to interpret the physical meanings of the cross correlations in these data driven models it may be argued however the proposed statistical models were able to indicate the important design characteristics and operational conditions that influence biofilter treatment performance that was the key aim of this study indeed the sensitivity analysis allowed us to learn the quantitative relationships between the coefficients fig 4 which can be used to further simplify these data driven statistical models by replacing many of the regression coefficients with the highly cross correlated coefficients thus making them even simpler and more practically applicable additional modelling exercises were done to test the simplified models full results presented in section 2 of the supplementary material briefly the additional modelling exercise showed that the operational conditions model bo2 for tp i e seven regression coefficients fig 4 can be simplified into a two regression coefficient model that has very close performance to the original seven coefficient model with only 1 5 difference in nse values based on the 5 fold calibration and validation 3 4 practical implementations of the data driven biofilter treatment models the statistical models developed in this study indicate the two most important design characteristics that stormwater managers should prioritise to ensure that nutrients are removed at the optimal rates from urban stormwater these design characteristics are vegetation type and submerged zone depth for tn and filter media type and depth for tp careful consideration and optimisation of these four design characteristics appears to be critical in ensuring high nutrient treatment performance this study also indicates that not only is it important to carefully design stormwater biofiltration systems it is highly important to control the operational conditions throughout a biofilter s lifetime to ensure that it is effectively removing nutrients from urban stormwater in particular infiltration rates and pollutant inflow concentrations were important operational conditions this highlights that it may be necessary to implement ongoing maintenance to ensure infiltration rates are kept at optimal levels and or to install real time monitoring and control sensors e g persaud et al 2019 shen et al 2020 to ensure that inflow concentrations of nutrients into the biofilter are controlled at optimal levels e g bypassing stormwater when the inflow concentrations are abnormally high the models developed in this study could eventually be used by stormwater managers for designing and operating biofiltration systems for tp and tn removal however before these models are used in practical situations they must be further calibrated and validated using field data with long term performance results or data from the international biofilter design database clary et al 2017 this is made difficult however by the fact that data collected in field studies and included in the international biofilter design database do not contain operational conditions such as infiltration rates which are extremely important for biofilter performance as such there is a need for future field studies to carefully monitor and report these operational conditions in addition this study did not find adwp as an important variable which is likely due to that the number of prolonged drying events included in the statistical analysis was small therefore the models might not be applicable to prolonged dry events and we recommend further testing of extreme weather conditions e g extreme wet and drought conditions and inclusion of these data in these statistical models this will result in models that can be used to predict biofilter treatment performance under extreme climate conditions which are expected to become more prevalent in the future although the proposed models were developed and tested based on nutrient removal in stormwater biofilters the same approach could be adopted to investigate the applicability of these models for predicting other pollutants e g metals micropollutants and microbes that biofilters receive in field conditions over the long term in addition the proposed models could be extended to include more parameters that influence pollutant removal for example microbial activity is an important factor for treatment performance that was not considered in this study although microbial activity is difficult to include as a specific parameter in statistical models it could be accounted for using a proxy variable one potential proxy variable is temperature which was found to impact nutrient levels in stormwater and their removal in biofilters hathaway et al 2016 halaburka et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 4 conclusion this study developed a series of data driven models to predict the tp and tn removal performance of stormwater biofilters these models were used to identify the relative influence of design characteristics and operational conditions on nutrient removal performance of biofilters relatively good performance of these models were observed with nses ranging from 0 42 to 0 61 for tp and 0 37 to 0 63 for tn when testing different combinations of predictors in models it was found that model performance was highest for the models which included four design characteristics and four operational conditions when using the nse as the objective function however the percentage improvement in nse was greatest for the models that included only two design characteristics and two operational conditions and thus bo2 models are preferable from the modelling perspective due to its simplicity in addition it was identified that the most important design characteristics and operational conditions that are needed for predicting nutrient removal in stormwater biofilters are filter media characteristics depth and type vegetation type and submerged zone depth as well as infiltration rate hydraulic conductivity and influent concentrations as such it is recommended that these biofilter design characteristics and operational conditions are optimised carefully when designing and installing stormwater biofiltration systems in addition this indicated that we should be trying to maintain optimal infiltration rates in biofiltrations systems via periodic maintenance and optimal influent concentrations by real time monitoring technologies the models developed and explored in this study could be be further validated and tested using field data and experimental laboratory scale data internationally for use as a predictive tool by urban planners and stormwater

17421,biofiltration systems can help mitigate the impact of urban runoff as they can treat retain and attenuate stormwater it is important to select the optimal design characteristics of biofilters e g vegetation filter media depth to ensure high treatment performance operational conditions e g infiltration rate can also lead to significant changes in biofilter treatment performance over time the impact of specific operational conditions on water quality treatment performance of stormwater biofilters is still not well understood furthermore despite the importance of design characteristics and operational conditions on biofilter treatment performance there is a lack of models that can be used to determine the optimal design and operation in this paper we developed a series of statistical models to predict the total phosphorus tp and total nitrogen tn removal performance of stormwater biofilters using various numbers of design characteristics and operational conditions these statistical models were tested using data collected from four extensive laboratory scale biofilter column studies it was found that all models performed relatively well with a nash sutcliffe efficiency nse of 0 42 0 61 for tp and 0 37 0 63 for tn the most important design characteristics were filter media type and depth for tp treatment and vegetation type and submerged zone depth for tn treatment in addition infiltration rate and inflow concentrations were the operational conditions that greatly influence outflow tp and tn concentrations from stormwater biofilters as such these variables need to be carefully considered when designing and operating stormwater biofilters sensitivity analysis results indicate that the model was quite sensitive to all regression coefficients and intercepts additional modelling exercises show that the model could be further simplified by reducing the number of cross correlated parameters these models can be used by practitioners for not just optimising the design but also operating biofilters using real time monitoring and control to achieve optimum performance graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords treatment hierarchical model nutrients data driven infiltration rate 1 introduction urban stormwater is a major contributor to the declining health of waterways changes to catchment hydrology as a result of urbanisation often leads to the physical degradation of urban streams and activities in urban areas generate pollutants that are carried into receiving water bodies by stormwater mcgrane 2016 the increase in the pollutants in streams can lead to eutrophication and reduced aquatic biodiversity stormwater biofilters also known as bioretention systems or rain gardens developed under the concept of water sensitive urban design also known as low impact development sustainable urban drainage systems fletcher et al 2015 are becoming one of the most popular technologies to control and treat polluted urban stormwater at or near its source payne et al 2019 biofilters typically consist of a vegetated basin or a trench containing soil or sand based media that subjects stormwater inflows to a number of treatment processes such as sedimentation fine filtration adsorption and biological uptake li and davis 2009 these systems are able to reduce the concentrations of typical stormwater pollutants while also being very versatile and relatively easy to fit into the urban landscape e g davis et al 2009 passeport et al 2009 water quality treatment and pollutant removal by biofilters largely depend on their design configurations e g afrooz and boehm 2017 dagenais et al 2018 muerdter et al 2018 bratieres et al 2008 found that due to the large number of physical and bio chemical processes involved in the removal of nutrients the selection of a few critical design characteristics such as vegetation and filter media type is required for effective nutrient removal others have reported similar findings for example several studies showed that total phosphorus tp removal varied widely with filter media type hsieh and davis 2005 hunt et al 2006 while henderson et al 2007 reported that total nitrogen tn outflow concentrations ranged from 6 09 mg l for non vegetated gravel filters to 1 23 mg l for vegetated loam filters 12 and 77 reduction respectively in addition inclusion of a submerged anoxic zone sz has been shown to improve the nitrogen removal performance by enhancing denitrification and providing a temporary reservoir for longer detention of water and support of plants and microbial communities during dry periods afrooz and boehm 2017 while optimised design configurations are important performance of stormwater biofilters may still vary substantially over time depending on the operational conditions for example many researchers e g hatt et al 2007 afrooz and boehm 2017 found that prolonged dry periods can have an adverse impact on biofilter treatment performance due to the reduced function of the plants and microbial communities and the creation of macropores in the filter media through root dieback leading to higher infiltration rates and preferential flow paths this effect however can be mitigated to some extent by the inclusion of submerged zones in the system design wang et al 2018 hydraulic loading has also been observed to impact system performance high hydraulic loading can lead to higher outflow pollution levels due to reduced detention and thus treatment time bratieres et al 2008 moreover higher infiltration rates which depends on the filter media properties presence of macropores formed due to long dry periods or the use of coarse rooted vegetation can also lead to poor performance due to the lower residence time for pollution removal le coustumer et al 2009 however contradictory results were presented by mohanty and boehm 2014 who observed that biofilter treatment performance in microbes is not greatly affected by infiltration rates the contradictory findings indicate that more studies are necessary to explore the impact of operational conditions on biofilter treatment performance this is especially important when the treated stormwater from biofilters is considered for re use due to potential health consequences while there are numerous studies looking into biofilter treatment performance there is a paucity of models that can predict biofiltration treatment performance most of the available models deal with the hydrologic balance of biofiltration systems or infiltration systems in general with water treatment included as conceptual models such as first order decay like in swmm rossman 2010 or music ewater 2014 water quality in terms of particulate capture is included in the process based model developed by li and davis 2008 randelovic et al 2016 developed a process based stormwater biofilter treatment model to simulate different removal processes of organic micropollutants one major drawback of these physically based models is the need for data for simulations which may not be easily available and also the difficulties in model calibration due to the fact that we often lack the data needed for calibration khan et al 2013 more recently data driven approaches have been used to establish relationships between biofilter performance and a range of input variables for example khan et al 2013 developed general linear regression models with nine different predictors to predict biofilter hydrological performance in terms of pollution treatment performance general linear models have been applied to understand the relationship between inflow and outflow nutrient concentrations for 11 biofilters mcnett et al 2011 in a more recent study wang et al 2019 used machine learning methods to investigate biofilter pollutant removal efficiency with a large range of design features however they did not take into account operational conditions of biofilter despite the evidence indicating the important role that operational conditions play in pollutant removal efficiency by stormwater biofilters le coustumer et al 2009 afrooz and boehm 2017 in addition the operational conditions are often not fully reported making it very difficult to perform data driven modelling approaches therefore there is a need to build on data driven studies but with an increased emphasis on including operational conditions in the models this would not onlyimprove model performance but also offer a proper and better understanding of their impact on biofilter performance this study aims to fill this gap by developing a series of statistical models of stormwater biofilter treatment performance using a data driven modelling approach the novelty in this approach lies in the fact that both design characteristics static factors and operational conditions dynamic factors were included in the statistical models dynamic factors have been rarely considered in previous stormwater biofilter models e g wang et al 2019 three innovative and different model structures single level and multi level were proposed these types of models have been previously used to identify the important explanatory variables that predict stream water quality guo et al 2020 identify key factors affecting stream bank erosion vietz et al 2018 and predict spatio temporal trends in macroinvertebrate levels in urban streams webb and king 2009 but have not been applied in stormwater biofilter studies yet in this study we focus on the removal of tp and tn four extensive laboratory experimental data sets representing a rare and important resource for such an analysis are used to develop and validate the data driven models the specific objectives of this paper are to understand the impact of design characteristics vegetation filter media type and depth submerged zone presence and operational conditions antecedent dry weather periods inflow flux inflow concentrations and infiltration rate on tp and tn removal performance to determine which and how many design and operational variables are needed to predict system performance and to develop a series of statistical models to design and operate stormwater biofilters for optimal nutrient removal the findings from this study provide insight into how operational conditions affect the pollutant removal performance of stormwater biofilters this will enable us to consider operational conditions as part of the design process but also implement real time control strategies to optimise system operation and ensure optimal tp and tn removal performance for both the health of receiving waterways and stormwater re use 2 method 2 1 data collection four large comprehensive laboratory column experiments conducted at monash university table 1 over the past 15 years provide the extensive dataset of stormwater biofilter pollutant removal performance used to undertake this analysis these datasets were selected because they recorded a range of key design and operational variables also all four studies used similar and consistent approaches to constructing and setting up the columns this helps us to eliminate other potential confounding factors during the modelling process the whole dataset comprised a total of 85 different biofilter designs covering typical recommended biofilter designs e g payne et al 2015 and centre for watershed protection 2009 53 sampling events with event mean concentrations emcs of inflow and outflow for tn and tp and a total of 3 904 observations refer to table s1 of the supplementary materials for details of the design and operational characteristics the details of the four experiments can be found in previously published papers table 1 and as such are only briefly explained below 2 1 1 design study 1 a laboratory scale column study was conducted to assess the influence of three biofilter design characteristics vegetation filter media type filter media depth and two operational conditions inflow concentration and inflow volume on biofilter treatment performance in total there were 24 design configurations each with five replicates the columns were tested using semi synthetic stormwater prepared using sediments from stormwater ponds and chemicals which had target concentrations typical of urban runoff tp 0 35 mg l and tn 2 1 mg l taylor et al 2005 each column was dosed twice a week and following a six month establishment period inflow and outflow water quality samples were collected approximately every seven weeks over 16 months 2 1 2 design study 2 a total of 245 columns with five replicates of each design were tested in this study the two key design factors tested in this study were vegetation type and presence and submerged zone presence or absence dosing frequency and hydraulic loading were also tested as operational factors the columns were dosed with semi synthetic stormwater twice a week the experiment lasted for 12 months and 14 dosing events were sampled infiltration rates were measured every three months and six infiltration rate measurements were taken during the experiment 2 1 3 dry weather study 1 in this laboratory study seven types of biofilter designs with five replicates each were tested for tp and tn removal two design factors filter media type and vegetation type and two operational factors dosing frequency and dosing volume were tested after a seven week column establishment period the columns were dosed with semi synthetic stormwater twice a week under normal operational conditions with target tp and tn concentrations of 0 37 mg l and 2 5 mg l respectively during the 36 week experiment the columns were subjected to one two and four weeks of extended drying as well as three challenge events where stormwater dosing volumes were double of what was usually applied nineteen sampling events were conducted in total infiltration rates were also measured at every sampling event as per chandrasena et al 2014 2 1 4 dry weather study 2 five different design configurations were tested in this study with five replicates each two design factors filter media type and vegetation type and three operational conditions dosing frequency dosing volume infiltration rate was tested after a seven week establishment phase columns were dosed twice a week with semi synthetic stormwater over a period of 45 weeks 15 sampling events were conducted in these four studies all water quality samples were analysed for tp and tn using standard methods hosomi and sudo 1986 apha awwa wpcf 1998 at national association of testing authorities nata accredited http www nata asn au laboratories 2 2 data preparation four biofilter key design variables and four operational variables table 2 were included in the statistical modelling all of them were previously reported to influence biofilter treatment performance e g mohanty and boehm 2014 afrooz and boehm 2017 dagenais et al 2018 chandrasena et al 2019 muerdter et al 2020 the type of plant species as well as filter media type were converted into binary values 1 or 0 to represent effective or non effective types respectively detailed information with regards to plant and media types e g effective or non effective as well as the statistics of numerical data values covered in the four different datasets are summarised in table s1 of the supplementary materials it should be noted that in some studies only 1 2 values of a particular variables were studied e g dry weather study 2 by chandrasena et al 2019 had a constant filter media depth of 0 40 m thus it was necessary to combine all of the four different datasets to have a range of values for different design or operational variables all numerical data i e excluding veg and fm were log transformed to ensure better symmetry in the distributions of the data to meet the assumptions of linear regression 2 3 proposed statistical model structures three statistical model structures were proposed as a way to conceptualise the impact of design factors and operational conditions on the treatment performance of stormwater biofilters as shown in table 3 model 1 variability around the mean model assumes that outflow concentration c outi j is modelled with a mean outflow concentration determined by specific system design j o u t f l o w j and a noise caused by real time operational conditions at time i δoutflow i j model 2 operational conditions model is a multi level hierarchical model which assumes outflow concentration at time i for design j c outi j is a linear function of operational variables adwp ir flux and c in with the regression coefficients aj bj cj and dj determined by the design characteristics of each system i e veg fm fmd and szd model 3 design characteristics model is another multi level model with the same structure as model 2 but with the design characteristics being the main variables in the model and the operational conditions determining the regression coefficients 2 4 model development and testing calibration and validation for each model structure we created all possible combinations of design factors and operational conditions to i investigate how different variables impact the treatment performance of biofilters and ii identify the model structures and the combination of design and operational variables that best predict outflow concentrations of tp and tn from stormwater biofilters for example if only adwp and fm are to be included in model 2 then the specific model will be c outi j int aj adwpi j and aj inta xa fmi j as there were four design characteristics total combinations c 4 1 c 4 2 c 4 3 c 4 4 15 and four operational conditions for each pollutant also 15 combinations this led to the development of 15 15 225 models for each pollutant and each model structure i e in total 2 pollutants 3 structures 225 models 1350 models a 5 fold calibration and validation approach was used to fit and rigorously test the 1350 models i e randomly selecting 80 data from the full datasets for model calibration and using the remaining 20 for validation the process was repeated five times to ensure the robustness of testing the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 for c out was used as performance indicator for calibration and validation python 3 7 and the function scipy optimize minimise in the sicpy package was adopted for parameter optimisation this package has also been applied in previous stormwater modelling studies selbig and fienen 2012 scipy optimize minimise minimises the objective function in this case nse value to maximise nse value using user defined optimisation methods e g bfgs nerlder mead powerll cg etc for details please refer to the documentation of the function at docs scipy org starting from an intial guess of parameter values preliminary modelling exercises were performed to select an optimisation method and initial model parameter values it was found that model performance was not sensitive to the selection of optimisation method or initial parameter values with the maximum nse values across all different combinations only differing slightly 5 thus for the full model runs i e five fold calibration and validation the default optimisation method bfgs was selected and initial regression coefficient values were all set to zero the biofilter design characteristics and operational conditions with the greatest predictive power were identified in two ways firstly from the results of the 5 fold calibration and validation the best performing combination of design characteristics and operational variables for each of the three model structures were extracted based on nse values this included the best performing models with one design and one operational variable termed as bo1 two design and two operational variables bo2 three design characteristics and three operational conditions bo3 and four design characteristics and four operational conditions bo4 i e four models were extracted for each of the three model structures in totaltwelve models secondly the contribution of each design characteristic and operational condition in improving the predictive performance of the statistical models was identified by evaluating the average drop in nse when the variables were not included in the models regardless of the number of predictors included in the model compared to when they were included in the models both of these methods were used to identify the design characteristics and operational conditions that are factors with the highest predictive performance of tp and tn removal performance using two methods enabled us to identify the most important predictors in a robust way 2 5 model uncertainty analysis model uncertainty analysis was conducted using the optimum models for tp and tn in terms of the specific number of predictors included and the statistical model structure type observed based on the results of 5 fold calibration and validation as such uncertainty analysis was conducted on one tp model and one tn model the glue method beven and binley 1992 was applied using 80 of the dataset randomly selected to understand the sensitivities of all model regression coefficients with their values sampled from uniform distributions informed by their calibrated values from the 5 fold calibration and validation the coefficient sensitivity matrix was generated using all the model runs with nse 0 0 i e indicating the model performed better than if average values were studied in this study an acceptability threshold of nse 0 45 highest average nse value 5 fold calibration validation was used to define behavioural model runs which were then used to generate prediction uncertainties for the remaining 20 of the dataset 3 results and discussion 3 1 data driven predictive models 3 1 1 comparing model structures the results of 5 fold calibration and validation of twelve statistical models had minimal variability in their model selection criterion and objective functions nses as shown in table 4 the standard deviations in nses between the multiple calibration and validation runs were between 0 002 and 0 028 in addition the nses of the validations were similar to those of the calibration runs these results suggest that the calibration and validation of these models are relatively robust using the nse as the criterion model performance is generally highest for model 2 the operational conditions model for tp and for model 3 the design characteristics model for tn while model 1 the variability around the mean model always had considerably lower performance for both pollutants table 4 however it appears that the nses do not vary largely between the operational conditions model and design characteristics model table 4 for example the percentage difference in nse between bo1 of the two models were 0 003 for tp and 9 3 for tn and between bo4 of the two models were even lower at 0 2 for tp and 0 8 for tn this suggests that from a model conceptualisation perspective table 3 having the operational variables influence how the design characteristics impact treatment performance predicts the stormwater biofilter treatment performance i e model 3 is similar to conceptually having the design characteristics influence how the biofilter treatment performance responds to operational conditions i e model 2 therefore as long as the most important design and operational parameters are considered detailed in section below both structures either model 2 or model 3 perform similarly 3 1 2 important design characteristics and operational variables to include in data driven biofilter treatment models table 4 provides the design characteristics and operational variables included in the best performing bo1 bo2 bo3 and bo4 models the models containing all design characteristics and operational conditions as predictors i e bo4 had the highest performance according to nse except model 1 in which bo4 was 3 lower than bo3 due to the slight variance across the five different calibration and validation steps this is to be expected due to the fact that nse does not penalise for increased model complexity dawson and wilby 2001 it should be noted however that the greatest increase in nse for both tp and tn and for all the three model structures occurred when the number of predictors was increased from one design and operational variable to two design characteristics and operational conditions table 4 there was a 12 25 increase in nse for tp and a 26 30 increase in nse for tn with this increase in the number of predictors from bo1 to bo2 this suggests that whilst it would be ideal to develop statistical predictive models of biofilter treatment performance using all four design characteristics and operational conditions if data for several of these variables are not available using two design characteristics and operational conditions can also result in good model predictive performance as an example comparison of the observed tp and tn outflow concentrations against tp and tn concentrations modelled using the operational conditions model and design characteristics models for both bo2 and bo4 indicates that models have relatively good performance regardless of whether there are two or four variables included in the model fig 1 therefore for the sake of brevity most of the following discussion of the variables included in the models will be done for the bo2 design characteristics models for tn and bo2 operational conditions models for tp as these had the most optimal performance according to change in nse but also relatively low levels of complexity 3 2 impact of design characteristics and operational conditions 3 2 1 design characteristics the most important variables in statistically predicting the stormwater biofilter treatment performance were consistent across different model structures as shown in fig 2 which indicates the average drops in nse when certain variables were excluded from the models the nse values indicate that the design variable that influenced tp treatment performance the most was filter media depth fmd had a 20 24 increase in nse when fmd was included followed by filter media type fm had a 20 24 increase in nse when fm was included fig 2a this had good agreement to the bo2 models for tp which always include fmd and fm as predictors table 4 this was arguably expected as a number of studies have shown that the physical filtration of tp from stormwater as it moves through the stormwater biofilter as well as sorption of phosphorus to filter media are essential for tp removal davis 2007 roy poirier et al 2010 liu and davis 2014 the regression coefficients for fmd average 0 849 fig 3 in the design characteristics model for tp shows that generally deeper fmd led to lower outflow concentrations in addition the phosphorus content of filter media has previously been found to have a strong influence on phosphorus leaching from stormwater biofilters hatt et al 2009 shrestha et al 2018 indeed the results of this study showed that sandy media that has relatively low organic matter and phosphorus content assigned as binary value 1 was more efficient in removing tp than were non effective media binary value 0 this is further reflected by the negative regression coefficient values of fm average 1 26 fig 3a for tn vegetation type was found to be the design variable that most strongly influenced its treatment performance with a 25 28 increase in nse from 0 32 to 0 43 when vegetation type was included in the models fig 2b the importance of vegetation presence and type for tn removal is well recognised nitrogen can be removed by plant uptake and microbial processes enhanced by the rhizosphere within stormwater biofilter systems read et al 2010 payne et al 2014c glaister et al 2017 the regression coefficients for vegetation in the tn design characteristics model are always negative average 1 0 fig 3b indicating that poor performing vegetation treatments e g non vegetated systems or dianella revoluta binary value 0 table s1 in the supplementary materials lead to a net increase in tn concentrations leaving the stormwater biofilter submerged zone depth szd was the second most important design variable for tn removal with a 14 16 increase in nse from 0 35 to 0 42 when szd was included fig 2b this was expected as the presence of a submerged zone has been found in many studies to have an important influence on the removal of nitrogen via denitrification and the survival of vegetation through extended dry periods chandrasena et al 2014 payne et al 2014c the szd regression coefficients in the tn design characteristics model are also always negative which indicates that deeper submerged zone depths lead to lower tn outflow concentrations fig 3b these results were in good agreement with the identified bo2 models for tn which always included the vegetation and szd as the two predictors table 4 3 2 2 operational conditions infiltration rate ir was found to be the operational condition that is most important for predicting both tp and tn removal in stormwater biofilters in both the design characteristics model and the operational conditions model as shown in fig 2 the nse increased by 84 87 from 0 24 to 0 48 for tp and by 45 50 from 0 30 to 0 46 for tn when the ir was included in the statistical models the regression coefficients for ir fig 3c d indicate that an increase in ir results in an increase in tp and tn outflow concentrations from the biofilter decreased hydrological residence time in the stormwater biofilter has been hypothesised to result in decreased sorption of soluble phosphorus to filter media roy poirier et al 2010 similar findings were observed by davis et al 2006 the second most important operational condition for predicting both tp and tn treatment performance by stormwater biofilters is inflow concentration cin on average 8 increase in nse when cin is included in the models fig 2 this is suprising as bratieres et al 2008 previously found that cin did not have big influence on outflow concentrations for tp and tn davis et al 2006 however observed that there is a predefined removal rate of nutrients in biofilters and high cin results in higher outflow concentrations in this study this relationship is demonstrated in the positive regression coefficients calculated for cin in the operational conditions model for both tp and for tn fig 3c d it should be noted that adwp was not found to be an important predictor of tp and tn removal performance by stormwater biofilters this contrasts with previous studies where an adwp of about 2 4 weeks could result in considerable deterioration in biofilter treatment performance hatt et al 2008 blecken et al 2009 payne et al 2014b it is hypothesised that the statistical modelling exercise did not identify adwp as an important predictor of biofilter treatment performance because the underlying dataset used to build the statistical models included few datapoints with extended dry periods of 2 to 4 weeks table s1 in supplementary materials we do not believe that this compromises the modelling exercise as previous studies have shown that the 50th percentile of dry periods in south east australia is 4 4 days and the 50th percentile for dry periods in our underlying dataset was 3 0 days zhang 2015 indicating the datasets used in this study represents realistic conditions 3 3 regression coefficient sensitivity and model predictions uncertainties results of the sensitivity analysis of the tp operational conditions model bo2 shown in fig 4 indicate that the model is quite sensitive to the fitted model regression coefficients and intercepts similar findings were observed for the tn design characteristics model bo3 figure s1 of the supplementary material it appears that deviating from the optimal regression coefficient and intercept values can lead to a substantial drop in model performance furthermore fig 4 indicates that when regression coefficients are randomly sampled from uniform distributions model performance could deteriorate substantially a symptom of low parameter identifiability whilst the average model outputs with log transformation are in line with observed data fig 5 there is the potential for some of the extreme model outputs 2 5th or 97 5th percentile to vary substantially from the observed data figure s2 of the supplementary material as such the sensitivity analysis emphasises the need for using good quality pre cleaned data to fit the regression coefficients and the intercepts there are also high cross correlations between regression coefficients of the parameters included in the optimal tp treatment performance models and also optimal tn models shown in figure s1 this was not unexpected due to the large number of regression coefficients and the data driven approach that was applied for model testing it was hard to interpret the physical meanings of the cross correlations in these data driven models it may be argued however the proposed statistical models were able to indicate the important design characteristics and operational conditions that influence biofilter treatment performance that was the key aim of this study indeed the sensitivity analysis allowed us to learn the quantitative relationships between the coefficients fig 4 which can be used to further simplify these data driven statistical models by replacing many of the regression coefficients with the highly cross correlated coefficients thus making them even simpler and more practically applicable additional modelling exercises were done to test the simplified models full results presented in section 2 of the supplementary material briefly the additional modelling exercise showed that the operational conditions model bo2 for tp i e seven regression coefficients fig 4 can be simplified into a two regression coefficient model that has very close performance to the original seven coefficient model with only 1 5 difference in nse values based on the 5 fold calibration and validation 3 4 practical implementations of the data driven biofilter treatment models the statistical models developed in this study indicate the two most important design characteristics that stormwater managers should prioritise to ensure that nutrients are removed at the optimal rates from urban stormwater these design characteristics are vegetation type and submerged zone depth for tn and filter media type and depth for tp careful consideration and optimisation of these four design characteristics appears to be critical in ensuring high nutrient treatment performance this study also indicates that not only is it important to carefully design stormwater biofiltration systems it is highly important to control the operational conditions throughout a biofilter s lifetime to ensure that it is effectively removing nutrients from urban stormwater in particular infiltration rates and pollutant inflow concentrations were important operational conditions this highlights that it may be necessary to implement ongoing maintenance to ensure infiltration rates are kept at optimal levels and or to install real time monitoring and control sensors e g persaud et al 2019 shen et al 2020 to ensure that inflow concentrations of nutrients into the biofilter are controlled at optimal levels e g bypassing stormwater when the inflow concentrations are abnormally high the models developed in this study could eventually be used by stormwater managers for designing and operating biofiltration systems for tp and tn removal however before these models are used in practical situations they must be further calibrated and validated using field data with long term performance results or data from the international biofilter design database clary et al 2017 this is made difficult however by the fact that data collected in field studies and included in the international biofilter design database do not contain operational conditions such as infiltration rates which are extremely important for biofilter performance as such there is a need for future field studies to carefully monitor and report these operational conditions in addition this study did not find adwp as an important variable which is likely due to that the number of prolonged drying events included in the statistical analysis was small therefore the models might not be applicable to prolonged dry events and we recommend further testing of extreme weather conditions e g extreme wet and drought conditions and inclusion of these data in these statistical models this will result in models that can be used to predict biofilter treatment performance under extreme climate conditions which are expected to become more prevalent in the future although the proposed models were developed and tested based on nutrient removal in stormwater biofilters the same approach could be adopted to investigate the applicability of these models for predicting other pollutants e g metals micropollutants and microbes that biofilters receive in field conditions over the long term in addition the proposed models could be extended to include more parameters that influence pollutant removal for example microbial activity is an important factor for treatment performance that was not considered in this study although microbial activity is difficult to include as a specific parameter in statistical models it could be accounted for using a proxy variable one potential proxy variable is temperature which was found to impact nutrient levels in stormwater and their removal in biofilters hathaway et al 2016 halaburka et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 4 conclusion this study developed a series of data driven models to predict the tp and tn removal performance of stormwater biofilters these models were used to identify the relative influence of design characteristics and operational conditions on nutrient removal performance of biofilters relatively good performance of these models were observed with nses ranging from 0 42 to 0 61 for tp and 0 37 to 0 63 for tn when testing different combinations of predictors in models it was found that model performance was highest for the models which included four design characteristics and four operational conditions when using the nse as the objective function however the percentage improvement in nse was greatest for the models that included only two design characteristics and two operational conditions and thus bo2 models are preferable from the modelling perspective due to its simplicity in addition it was identified that the most important design characteristics and operational conditions that are needed for predicting nutrient removal in stormwater biofilters are filter media characteristics depth and type vegetation type and submerged zone depth as well as infiltration rate hydraulic conductivity and influent concentrations as such it is recommended that these biofilter design characteristics and operational conditions are optimised carefully when designing and installing stormwater biofiltration systems in addition this indicated that we should be trying to maintain optimal infiltration rates in biofiltrations systems via periodic maintenance and optimal influent concentrations by real time monitoring technologies the models developed and explored in this study could be be further validated and tested using field data and experimental laboratory scale data internationally for use as a predictive tool by urban planners and stormwater

17422,reverse osmosis ro seawater desalination is a widely applied technological process to supply potable water worldwide recently saline groundwater sgw pumped from beach wells in coastal aquifers that penetrate beneath the freshwater seawater interface is considered as a better alternative water source to ro seawater desalination as it is naturally filtered within the sediments which reduces membrane fouling and pre treatment costs the sgw of many coastal aquifers is anoxic and thus in a low redox stage has elevated concentrations of dissolved manganese iron and sulfides we studied the influence of the sgw redox stage and chemistry on the performance permeate flux and fouling properties of ro desalination process sgws from three different coastal aquifers were sampled and characterized chemically and ro desalination experiments were performed under inert and oxidized conditions our results show that all three aquifers have anoxic saline groundwater and two of them have intensive anaerobic oxidation of organic matter two aquifers were found to be in the denitrification stage or slightly lower and the third one in the sulfate reduction stage our results indicate that the natural redox stage of sgws from coastal aquifers affects the performance of ro desalination all sgw types showed better ro performance over seawater desalination furthermore air oxidation of the sgw was accompanied with ph elevation which increased the membrane fouling hence keeping the feed water unexposed to atmospheric conditions for maintaining the natural reducing stage of the sgw is crucial for low fouling potential the observed benefits of using naturally reduced sgw in ro desalination have significant implications for reduction in overall process costs graphical abstract image

greve et al 2018 as freshwater resources become depleted due to ongoing overexploitation and contamination especially in arid and semi arid regions hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 a key technology for coping with the freshwater shortage is reverse osmosis ro desalination which accounts for almost 70 of the global desalination capacity amy et al 2017 on a global scale about 60 of the feed water for desalination is seawater 23 is brackish water and the remainder comprises wastewater and other sources shahzad et al 2017 saline groundwater sgw from coastal aquifers is an alternative source for seawater desalination dehwah and missimer 2016 sola et al 2013 stein et al 2016 as it possesses a reduced fouling propensity due to the natural filtration it undergoes through the porous media stein et al 2016 moreover its use leads to decreased greenhouse gas emissions due to lower energy consumption dehwah and missimer 2016 and reduced process costs than are required in conventional seawater desalination sgw is the saline water body in a coastal aquifer that is naturally created by seawater intrusion which is in hydrodynamic equilibrium with the freshwater body above it the natural dynamic of the fresh saline water interface fsi andersen et al 2005 michael et al 2005 yechieli et al 2010 in many coastal aquifers is altered by the overexploitation of the fresh groundwater and this pushes the fsi further inland houben and post 2017 zhou et al 2005 thereby salinizing the groundwater and degrading its quality pumping sgw from a coastal aquifer as feed for desalination plant was shown to shift the fsi toward the well thus freshening and rehabilitating the aquifer in its vicinity stein et al 2019 2020 the membranes used in ro desalination suffer from fouling the deposition and accumulation of substances on the membrane surface membrane fouling is especially problematic for ro and nanofiltration technologies in which backwashing is not applicable fouling which increases the membrane s hydraulic resistance and reduces its overall performance may comprise colloidal or mineral deposition scaling adherence of organics or biofilm growth biofouling sim et al 2018 to improve the ro process and reduce its operational costs it is critical to find an efficient solution to membrane fouling understanding the influence of sgw chemistry on the desalination performance is crucial for reducing membrane fouling in sgw desalination specifically the reduction oxidation redox stage of sgw differs from that of seawater and its effect on the desalination process is not fully understood the fsi often manifests as an oxycline wherein the upper freshwater part is oxidized while the sgw is oxygen depleted russak et al 2015 sivan et al 2005 the exhaustion of the oxygen in the saline zone causes anaerobic metabolism to dominate using other electron acceptors according to their energy yields stumm and morgan 2012 a variety of redox stages of the sgw that are driven by denitrification the reductive dissolution of manganese and iron oxide minerals sulfate reduction and finally methanogenesis with the lowest redox stage are found around the world charette et al 2005 connor et al 2015 kim et al 2014 porubsky et al 2014 roy et al 2010 santos et al 2011 snyder et al 2004 a previous study showed reductive dissolution of iron and manganese in saline groundwater of coastal environments duncan and shaw 2003 furthermore near the fsi the redox stage is altered due to oscillations in the interface level at which dissolved iron is precipitated when the environment becomes oxic sirois et al 2018 moreover another study found that the presence of natural organic matter in the groundwater enhances the rate of iron reduction chen et al 2003 the use of anaerobic groundwater as feed water for desalination may enhance fouling because upon exposure of the effluents to atmospheric oxygen dissolved iron and sulfur may precipitate as sulfur and iron oxides at a desalination plant in bahrein colloidal sulfur concentrations of 5 ppm in anoxic raw water caused severe fouling in the pretreatment cartridge filters and in the ro membranes by sulfur deposits within two days of operation ning et al 2005 at a desalination plant in fort myers nanofiltration treatment of anoxic groundwater was affected by particle fouling due to the precipitation of iron hydroxide and elemental sulfur nederlof et al 2000 in laboratory experiments researchers found that the addition of reduced iron to oxic feed water resulted in the rapid precipitation of iron oxides and extensive membrane fouling yiantsios and karabelas 2003 hence the unique redox conditions of saline groundwater may affect the ro process and membrane fouling behavior the aim of the present study was to investigate how the natural redox stage of the sgw from coastal aquifers affects the performance of the ro desalination process we sampled and characterized the sgw of three different coastal zones the eastern mediterranean the red sea and the dead sea coastal aquifers with potentially different compositions and redox stages ro desalination experiments of the different sgw types were then carried out to test the performance and fouling characteristics of the process additionally different exposures of the feed water to atmospheric oxygen were tested and the effects on the water chemistry and fouling behavior were examined to the best of our knowledge this study provides the first insight on desalination of naturally reduced saline groundwater in coastal regions and its implications for control of membrane fouling 2 methods 2 1 sampling sites 2 1 1 the eastern mediterranean coastal aquifer nitsanim nature reserve the nitsanim nature reserve is located on the southern

36 m in a gravel layer that layer is confined by upper and lower impermeable clay layers with thicknesses of 3 and 1 m respectively seawater from the desalination plant in ashkelon fig 1 was also

sampling sites and aquifers 2 2 water sampling and field procedures sgw in the nitsanim and eilat sampling campaigns was collected with a submersible pump grundfos bjerringbro denmark in the ein feshkha dead sea sampling campaign a pump was not needed due to the artesian nature of the well seawater was collected from the inlet of the ashkelon desalination plant to sample the feed water source of an industrial seawater desalination plant sgw was sampled in an inert environment by collecting the water in a 200 l tank filled with nitrogen gas during water sampling the gas was released from the tank through an outlet pipe and a gas trap for eilat and ein feshkha waters half of the sampled volume 100 l was kept inert as described and the other half was oxidized by opening the tank and

sw30hr dow filmtec at a constant pressure while monitoring the permeate flux decline the ro filtration system is shown schematically in fig 2 the large water tank 200 l of sgw or seawater sampled in the field was kept in an inert atmosphere n2 during the sampling and during the filtration experiment and was mixed by a small circulation pump immersed in the tank for the oxidized waters no nitrogen atmosphere was applied the filtration system was operated in a feed and bleed mode feed water was pumped from the 200 l tank at 100 ml min 1 into the ro system by a peristaltic pump mrc while the permeate and concentrate were recycled back into a small water tank 10 l fig 2 water was drained from the small tank at a rate flux equal to the inlet flux 100 ml min 1 that maintained a constant

compositions of specific particles 3 results and discussion 3 1 water chemistry and redox conditions sgw from three different coastal aquifers and seawater from the intake pipe of the ashkelon desalination plant prior to treatment were sampled fig 1 all sgws were sampled several meters below the fsi and their water chemistries were analyzed table 1 the average salinity measurement total dissolved solids tds for all the sgw samples was around 30 ppt compared with the 42 ppt of the eastern mediterranean seawater indicating some mixing with the fresh groundwater body the slightly lower average salinity observed in the sgw samples which was close to that of the nearby seawater is typical to the levels of salinity in many other sgws from coastal aquifers around the world russak and sivan 2010 sivan et al 2005 yechieli et al 2009 the ion concentrations of the sgw from all three aquifers were however deviated from simple mixing with fresh groundwater the simple mixing was calculated using the concentration of the cl ion see si equation s5 which was shown to be a conservative chemical specie in those coastal aquifers and mimics the tds of the water avrahamov et al 2010 russak and sivan 2010 among the non conservative ions in the sgw are ca2 na k and sr2 compared with the relative concentrations of ca2 in the seawater samples those in the sgws of nitsanim and eilat were enriched exhibiting increases from 11 45 mm in the mediterranean sea to 15 2 mm in nitsanim and from 12 2 mm in the gulf of aqaba lazar et al 2004 to 15 2 mm in eilat groundwater na showed the opposite trend and it was depleted in the sgws of nitsanim and eilat 460 mm and 325 mm respectively compared with seawater concentrations in the mediterranean sea and in the red sea 592 mm and 561 mm respectively al ouran 2005 which were 6 and 10 below conservative mixing these processes of depletion and enrichment are caused mainly by cation exchange in aquifers due to salinization and freshening events russak and sivan 2010 other geochemical processes such as the dissolution and precipitation of minerals e g caco3 which occur during salinization or freshening events affect also the chemical composition of the water andersen et al 2005 barker et al 1998 magaritz and luzier 1985 price and herman 1991 russak and sivan 2010 wicks et al 1995 wicks and herman 1996 at ein feshkha the discrepancies between the sgw and seawater concentrations of various ions due to simple mixing in the aquifer may possibly be attributed to the precipitation of different minerals such as gypsum kiro et al 2013 celestine and barite kiro et al 2012 in the fsi zone an additional process that has marked effect on the ion compositions of the different groundwater types is biogeochemical mediated organic matter oxidation in many sgws it has been shown that intensive organic matter oxidation by oxygen leads to its depletion and subsequently suboxic to anoxic conditions indeed the oxygen levels measured in each of our studied aquifers were from 0 to 0 13 mg l 1 and the obtained orp values were negative 60 230 mv table 1 the negative orp values found in ein feshkha were the lowest of the sample sites followed by eilat and then nitsanim and all of the sites exhibited anaerobic respiration processes anaerobic oxidation of organic matter releases hco3 thus elevating the dic concentration and alkalinity by the same ratio aerobic oxidation of organic matter in contrast releases mainly co2 but has almost no effect on the alkalinity sivan et al 2005 in all three groundwater systems organic matter was most likely oxidized anaerobically which was evidenced by the increase in both alkalinity and dic by a ratio of 1 fig 3 a the trend corresponds only to the reduced samples it can also be seen that the increases in alkalinity and dic were accompanied by lower δ13cdic values fig 3b this association supports intense microbial oxidation of organic carbon in which the light carbon isotope is preferable appelo and postma 2005 this suggests that the ein feshkha aquifer has the most intense microbial activity of the examined aquifers and that the eilat site has the lowest microbial activity another explanation for the low δ13cdic of ein feshkha can be attributed to the relative high dilution of the dead sea water with value of 0 with fresh groundwater with low value of 10 o even though it possesses similar salinities with the other coastal aquifers the total organic carbon toc found in the aquifers also supports the conclusion of intense microbial activity as the aquifer in ein feshkha possessed the highest toc concentration 2 ppm relative to the aquifers in nitsanim 1 12 ppm and in eilat 0 5 ppm table 1 the low bacterial activity of the red sea coastal aquifer can be explained by the oligotrophic nature of the red sea reiss and hottinger 2012 the different extents of organic carbon oxidation that led to varied redox conditions observed in the three aquifers may also lead to the dominance of correspondingly different anaerobic microbial respiration processes in the aquifers stumm and morgan 2012 previous studies of the mediterranean coastal aquifer at nitsanim found that denitrification was the dominant process for anaerobic bacterial respiration russak et al 2015 sivan et al 2005 in the current study the concentrations detected for nitrate 80 µm nitrite 0 9 µm and ammonium 2 4 µm matched the redox condition denitrification that was found within the fsi zone fig 4 and table 1 the concentrations of ammonium and nitrite in the sgw were higher than their concentrations in seawater this is expected for anaerobic conditions when ammonium is not oxidized and denitrification takes place nitrite is an intermediate species in this process furthermore ferrous and manganese were not detected in the sgw of nitsanim and the sulfate concentration was that expected from simple mixing dilution of seawater fig 4a implying that the redox stage in this aquifer had only reached denitrification and not sulfate reduction the aquifer in eilat showed no depletion in sulfate and no dissolved iron or manganese moreover it contained 50 µm of nitrate 0 47 µm of nitrite and 0 58 µm of ammonium table 1 these findings suggest the presence of mutual microbial nitrification and denitrification processes but these occur at low rates due to the low organic matter content of the groundwater in the ein feshkha coastal aquifer nitrogen compounds comprised a very low concentration of nitrate 0 1 µm a high concentration of ammonium 4 5 µm and a relatively high concentration of nitrite 0 6 µm table 1 fig 4b d these findings suggest that the redox conditions enable the occurrence of denitrification however dissolved manganese 1 4 µm and iron 4 3 µm were also found at this site indicating that the redox stage has reached reduction of manganese and iron oxides furthermore the sulfide concentration of 32 2 µm and a sulfate concentration that was lower than expected from simple mixing of dead sea water fig 4a imply that sulfate reduction is occurring although the coexistence of sulfide and fe2 is uncommon due to their tendency to precipitate as iron monosulfide and pyrite canfield 1989 kraal et al 2013 previous studies reported their coexistence in other coastal aquifers e g georgia delaware and south korea kim et al 2014 mcallister et al 2015 snyder et al 2004 yet another study showed by measuring methane and sulfate concentrations and their isotopes that sulfate reduction in the dead sea coastal aquifer was coupled to the anaerobic oxidation of methane avrahamov et al 2014 which in this aquifer may be produced in deep layers avrahamov et al 2015 it can therefore be concluded that the redox stage of the ein feshkha aquifer has favored sulfate reduction 3 2 ro desalination and fouling experiments with the different water types fouling experiments were conducted in the ro cross flow filtration system fig 2 to evaluate the fouling potential of seawater and of the sgw sampled from the different coastal aquifers the desalination experiments with the three sgw types were conducted in their natural anaerobic conditions by keeping the water samples under nitrogen atmosphere during the experiment furthermore the oxidized sgw of ein feshkha and eilat were tested as well to determine the potential outcome of oxidation of the feed water prior to the desalination process flat sheet commercial ro membranes sw30hr membrane were first compacted with a nacl solution for 24 h with 50 bars of pressure and initial flux of 30 l m 2 h 1 the filtration experiments of the different water types started with an initial permeate flux j0 of 29 8 3 6 l m 2 h 1 by adjusting the applied pressure due to the difference in water salinities and the permeate flux over time was recorded at constant pressure the results from the seawater experiment showed that the permeate flux declined from the initial value to an average of 20 1 l m 2 h 1 j j0 of 0 75 during 8 h which represents a 34 reduction fig 5 the desalination with all the sgw types showed better performance than that with seawater as a result of the lower fouling propensity of the sgw compared to that of the seawater which resulted in accordingly smaller reductions in flux under sgw desalination the experiment with the sgw from the mediterranean coastal aquifer nitsanim showed a permeate flux decline of 10 fig 5 the higher fouling propensity of mediterranean seawater compared with the low fouling propensity of sgw from the nearby coastal aquifer nitsanim was observed in a previous study stein et al 2016 and is in agreement with the flux decline observed in the current study the experiment with the sgw from the red sea coastal aquifer eilat showed a flux reduction of 8 fig 5 the experiment with the sgw from the dead sea coastal aquifer ein feshkha stabilized at an average normalized flux of 0 92 which is an 8 reduction from the initial flux as in the eilat aquifer despite the different redox stages of the nitsanim and eilat sgws compared to that of the ein feshkha sgw all three aquifers showed generally the same reduction in flux the lower fouling propensity of sgw is a major benefit of using it rather than seawater as the feed for desalination the lower applied pressure required in sgw desalination translates into reduced energy demand less membrane cleaning and lower operational costs evaluation of the sdi values for the sgw of nitsanim eilat and ein feshkha showed 4 6 5 44 and 0 91 min 1 respectively which are lower than the sdi of seawater 6 35 min 1 table 1 a sensitive parameter sdi can be used to predict fouling potential mosset et al 2008 and indeed in this study the seawater had a higher sdi and showed a higher fouling propensity than the sgw samples in some cases such as in almeria and saudi arabia the natural filtration of the aquifer reduces the sdi values by more than 90 rachman et al 2014 sola et al 2013 other possible causes for the higher fouling of seawater compared with that of sgw are the oxygen levels and the presence of transparent exopolymer particles that are secreted by marine microorganisms in seawater bar zeev et al 2009 the lower oxygen levels in sgw than in seawater table 1 is beneficial as it inhibits biofilm production on the membrane and was shown to prolong membrane life span beyer et al 2014 in our experiment although significant biofouling is not expected during the operation of the ro experiments the potentially reduced biofouling propensity of sgw may be an additional important advantage for continuous ro desalination practices the sgws of eilat and ein feshkha were oxidized by opening the tank and stirring for 24 h after which the do of the water was at saturation ro filtration experiments were then conducted with the oxidized waters the experiment with the oxidized water of eilat showed a permeate flux decline that reached an average flux of 27 1 l m 2 h 1 which is a 13 reduction from the initial flux j j0 of 0 87 fig 5 the flux decline of the oxidized sgw of eilat was larger than the flux decline found for the natural reduced water of eilat permeate flux during the ro filtration of the ein feshkha oxidized water was reduced to 26 6 l m 2 h 1 j j0 of 0 88 which is a 12 reduction in flux fig 5 similar to our findings for the oxidized eilat water in tests of the ein feshkha water a greater reduction in flux was obtained with the oxidized compared with the natural reduced state water the higher fouling levels observed for the oxidized compared with the natural reduced waters of both eilat and ein feshkha imply that the redox stages of the waters may influence their fouling propensities in the ro desalination process the oxidation of naturally reduced water can cause precipitation due to changes in the solution chemistry where reduced species that are naturally dissolved may precipitate due to the change of their oxidation state also the enhanced fouling and scaling of the oxidized waters can be attributed to the increased ph values of the two aquifer waters the natural ph values of eilat and ein feshkha are 7 06 and 6 75 respectively while after the oxidation process those values were elevated to 7 5 and 7 7 respectively these observed increases in ph which are attributed to co2 release to the atmosphere during the oxidation stage may cause mineral precipitation especially of carbonates whose solubility decreases at high ph values indeed caco3 precipitation was observed in the water tank confirmed by x ray diffraction xrd analysis fig s1 during the 24 h oxidation of the ein feshkha water which exhibited the largest change in ph the ca2 and the dic concentrations of the oxidized ein feshkha water were lower than in the natural reduced form table 1 findings that are in agreement with the caco3 precipitation hence both the change in the redox stage and with the increase in ph upon oxidation contributed to the increased fouling propensity of the oxidized water 3 3 characteristics of the fouling layer on the ro membranes to study the fouling properties of each water type the fouled membranes from each experiment were examined the ionic compositions of the foulants were determined by dissolving the precipitates in a fixed volume of nitric acid followed by icp measurement the membrane of the seawater desalination experiment showed a high silicon content and relatively high levels of sulfur iron and magnesium table 2 silicon and iron were also observed by surface elemental analysis by xps of the seawater membrane table s1 the observation that silicon and iron were observed in high concentrations on the fouled membrane but were below the detection limit in the feed seawater indicates their being aggregated and concentrated on the membrane during the ro filtration process other studies detected silicate and iron fouling during seawater desalination aubry et al 2014 li et al 2012 and in some cases the fouling resulted from the dissolved ionic forms of silicates and iron li et al 2012 when these were present recent review articles indicated that the most common foulant types of seawater ro desalination are colloidal iron and silica badruzzaman et al 2019 jiang et al 2017 generally iron fouling on ro membranes is mostly colloidal usually as silicates ning 2009 the foulant composition of the membrane used in the nitsanim natural reduced sgw experiment showed high contents of silicon calcium and magnesium table 2 in this case it is plausible that colloidal magnesium silicates were the dominant foulants due to the sand stone dominance in this aquifer the fouling layer of the eilat reduced sgw ro experiment was dominated by calcium and it had relatively equal depositions of magnesium sulfur and silicon calcium sulfur and silicon were also detected by the xps surface analysis table s1 these elements probably originated from the magmatic and metamorphic crystalline host rocks of the alluvial aquifer in eilat sem analysis shows depositions of aluminosilicates with high iron content including iron particles in the µm size range fig s2 the ionic profiles of the membrane depositions from the ro experiment with the oxidized eilat water were similar to those of its natural reduced form table 2 and sem analysis detected particle deposition with the above elements fig s3 the oxidation of the eilat water did not substantially change the chemical composition of the feed water table 1 which is in agreement with similar fouling properties of eilat natural and oxidized waters the membrane from the ro experiment with the ein feshkha natural water was fouled mainly with calcium and magnesium with silicon deposits table 2 xps surface analysis shows a similar trend of finding calcium magnesium and silicon on the membrane table s1 the fouled membrane from the experiment of oxidized ein feshkha water shows a similar deposition pattern namely mostly calcium and magnesium with additional silicon but in this case the calcium and magnesium were present in much higher concentrations table 2 this finding is probably due to the formation of calcium and magnesium precipitates in the oxidized groundwater as discussed above for caco3 and it agrees with the more intense fouling observed for the oxidized water fig 5 ferrous iron is often observed in anoxic groundwaters but when these are exposed to the partial pressure of oxygen in the atmosphere it is oxidized and precipitates as ferric hydroxide within minutes to hours sung and forbes 1984 in the natural reduced ein feshkha water iron was in its dissolved reduced form however oxidation of the water did not significantly increase the level of iron deposition on the membrane probably due to its low concentration in the bulk ein feshkha water 4 µm table 1 sulfur was detected in higher concentrations on the membrane of the oxidized experiment compared with the natural reduced form of the ein feshkha water this may be due to the behavior of dissolved reduced sulfur sulfide as hs 32 2 µm in ein feshkha sgw table 1 and the deposition of elemental sulfur when oxidized a coastal aquifer in delaware bay was found to have dissolved ferrous iron concentrations of 1000 µm and sulfide concentrations of up to 466 µm mcallister et al 2015 that upon oxidation may strongly precipitate these findings indicate that the redox stage of coastal aquifers may have a marked impact on ro processes therefore to predict the potential fouling and associated challenges of applying the ro system in the treatment of saline groundwaters it is essential that the concentrations of the redox species present in the water and their dynamics be accurately measured and fully understood ning et al showed that running an ro desalination plant with feed water from an aquifer in bahrein that contained 90 µm of sulfide resulted in severe elemental sulfur fouling within two days of starting operation ning et al 2005 saturation index calculations for different minerals in the studied water types were performed by phreeqc software parkhurst and appelo 1999 taking into account the concentration polarization in the ro system used for the filtration experiments table 3 in addition the si includes further explanation about the calculations for concentration polarization and salt rejection fig s2 in general almost all of the minerals presented in table 3 had higher saturation index values for the oxidized sgw than for the natural reduced form all water types exhibited a tendency for the precipitation of caco3 aragonite and calcite and calcium magnesium carbonate huntite camg3 co3 4 thus scaling by these minerals can explain the calcium and magnesium deposits that were found on all membranes silicate minerals such as talc antigorite and quartz were each found to have a positive saturation index in all experiments besides those with seawater because silicon was not detected in the seawater thus silicates are a potential scaling factor in the sgw desalination process in the oxidized ein feshkha water the silicate mineral anthophyllite was found to have a positive saturation index interestingly iron minerals such as goethite and pyrite had high positive saturation index values in the natural reduced ein feshkha water elemental sulfur deposition is likely to occur both in ein feshkha natural water and in its oxidized form which had sulfide concentrations of 32 2 and 1 53 µm respectively sem analyses indicated the presence of sulfur dominated spots on the membranes used for the natural and oxidized ein feshkha water filtrations figures s4 and s5 4 conclusions the findings of this work show how the natural redox stage of sgws from coastal aquifers affects the performance of ro desalination in addition this study demonstrates the benefits of sgw desalination over seawater desalination the natural reducing conditions of the sgw have major implications for the ro process as it results in a lower fouling propensity compared with the oxidized form of the water and the seawater maintenance of the natural reducing stage of the water may prevent precipitation by keeping the iron and sulfur species in their reduced dissolved forms and by reducing the saturation index of relevant minerals thereby reducing the membrane scaling phenomenon one of the principal conclusions from this study therefore is the importance of preventing the feed water from being exposed to atmospheric conditions due to their potential oxidation and to co2 release and a subsequent rise in ph that was shown to enhance mineral precipitation keeping the groundwater in its natural state will reduce the total cost of the ro process as the need for feed stream pretreatments is reduced significantly this work shows that low redox stage of the feed water improves desalination performance reduced conditions cause less fouling where different redox levels of anaerobic natural waters have comparable ro system performance the sgws from nitsanim and eilat were found to be in a denitrification stage while ein feshkha was in a sulfate reduction stage but all three water types showed comparable fouling propensities fig 5b using naturally reduced sgws from coastal aquifers as the feed water for ro desalination may result in reduced membrane fouling thus ameliorating the associated problems and costs typically encountered during ro process operation these findings together with the lower salinity of the sgw relative to seawater indicate that the use of sgw in ro desalination systems may reduce the energy demand and overall operational costs of the ro process declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

17422,reverse osmosis ro seawater desalination is a widely applied technological process to supply potable water worldwide recently saline groundwater sgw pumped from beach wells in coastal aquifers that penetrate beneath the freshwater seawater interface is considered as a better alternative water source to ro seawater desalination as it is naturally filtered within the sediments which reduces membrane fouling and pre treatment costs the sgw of many coastal aquifers is anoxic and thus in a low redox stage has elevated concentrations of dissolved manganese iron and sulfides we studied the influence of the sgw redox stage and chemistry on the performance permeate flux and fouling properties of ro desalination process sgws from three different coastal aquifers were sampled and characterized chemically and ro desalination experiments were performed under inert and oxidized conditions our results show that all three aquifers have anoxic saline groundwater and two of them have intensive anaerobic oxidation of organic matter two aquifers were found to be in the denitrification stage or slightly lower and the third one in the sulfate reduction stage our results indicate that the natural redox stage of sgws from coastal aquifers affects the performance of ro desalination all sgw types showed better ro performance over seawater desalination furthermore air oxidation of the sgw was accompanied with ph elevation which increased the membrane fouling hence keeping the feed water unexposed to atmospheric conditions for maintaining the natural reducing stage of the sgw is crucial for low fouling potential the observed benefits of using naturally reduced sgw in ro desalination have significant implications for reduction in overall process costs graphical abstract image

greve et al 2018 as freshwater resources become depleted due to ongoing overexploitation and contamination especially in arid and semi arid regions hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 a key technology for coping with the freshwater shortage is reverse osmosis ro desalination which accounts for almost 70 of the global desalination capacity amy et al 2017 on a global scale about 60 of the feed water for desalination is seawater 23 is brackish water and the remainder comprises wastewater and other sources shahzad et al 2017 saline groundwater sgw from coastal aquifers is an alternative source for seawater desalination dehwah and missimer 2016 sola et al 2013 stein et al 2016 as it possesses a reduced fouling propensity due to the natural filtration it undergoes through the porous media stein et al 2016 moreover its use leads to decreased greenhouse gas emissions due to lower energy consumption dehwah and missimer 2016 and reduced process costs than are required in conventional seawater desalination sgw is the saline water body in a coastal aquifer that is naturally created by seawater intrusion which is in hydrodynamic equilibrium with the freshwater body above it the natural dynamic of the fresh saline water interface fsi andersen et al 2005 michael et al 2005 yechieli et al 2010 in many coastal aquifers is altered by the overexploitation of the fresh groundwater and this pushes the fsi further inland houben and post 2017 zhou et al 2005 thereby salinizing the groundwater and degrading its quality pumping sgw from a coastal aquifer as feed for desalination plant was shown to shift the fsi toward the well thus freshening and rehabilitating the aquifer in its vicinity stein et al 2019 2020 the membranes used in ro desalination suffer from fouling the deposition and accumulation of substances on the membrane surface membrane fouling is especially problematic for ro and nanofiltration technologies in which backwashing is not applicable fouling which increases the membrane s hydraulic resistance and reduces its overall performance may comprise colloidal or mineral deposition scaling adherence of organics or biofilm growth biofouling sim et al 2018 to improve the ro process and reduce its operational costs it is critical to find an efficient solution to membrane fouling understanding the influence of sgw chemistry on the desalination performance is crucial for reducing membrane fouling in sgw desalination specifically the reduction oxidation redox stage of sgw differs from that of seawater and its effect on the desalination process is not fully understood the fsi often manifests as an oxycline wherein the upper freshwater part is oxidized while the sgw is oxygen depleted russak et al 2015 sivan et al 2005 the exhaustion of the oxygen in the saline zone causes anaerobic metabolism to dominate using other electron acceptors according to their energy yields stumm and morgan 2012 a variety of redox stages of the sgw that are driven by denitrification the reductive dissolution of manganese and iron oxide minerals sulfate reduction and finally methanogenesis with the lowest redox stage are found around the world charette et al 2005 connor et al 2015 kim et al 2014 porubsky et al 2014 roy et al 2010 santos et al 2011 snyder et al 2004 a previous study showed reductive dissolution of iron and manganese in saline groundwater of coastal environments duncan and shaw 2003 furthermore near the fsi the redox stage is altered due to oscillations in the interface level at which dissolved iron is precipitated when the environment becomes oxic sirois et al 2018 moreover another study found that the presence of natural organic matter in the groundwater enhances the rate of iron reduction chen et al 2003 the use of anaerobic groundwater as feed water for desalination may enhance fouling because upon exposure of the effluents to atmospheric oxygen dissolved iron and sulfur may precipitate as sulfur and iron oxides at a desalination plant in bahrein colloidal sulfur concentrations of 5 ppm in anoxic raw water caused severe fouling in the pretreatment cartridge filters and in the ro membranes by sulfur deposits within two days of operation ning et al 2005 at a desalination plant in fort myers nanofiltration treatment of anoxic groundwater was affected by particle fouling due to the precipitation of iron hydroxide and elemental sulfur nederlof et al 2000 in laboratory experiments researchers found that the addition of reduced iron to oxic feed water resulted in the rapid precipitation of iron oxides and extensive membrane fouling yiantsios and karabelas 2003 hence the unique redox conditions of saline groundwater may affect the ro process and membrane fouling behavior the aim of the present study was to investigate how the natural redox stage of the sgw from coastal aquifers affects the performance of the ro desalination process we sampled and characterized the sgw of three different coastal zones the eastern mediterranean the red sea and the dead sea coastal aquifers with potentially different compositions and redox stages ro desalination experiments of the different sgw types were then carried out to test the performance and fouling characteristics of the process additionally different exposures of the feed water to atmospheric oxygen were tested and the effects on the water chemistry and fouling behavior were examined to the best of our knowledge this study provides the first insight on desalination of naturally reduced saline groundwater in coastal regions and its implications for control of membrane fouling 2 methods 2 1 sampling sites 2 1 1 the eastern mediterranean coastal aquifer nitsanim nature reserve the nitsanim nature reserve is located on the southern part of the coastal plain of israel fig 1 the well that was used for this study 112 w is located 230 m from shore and is 55 m deep it cuts through the sandy cross section while the well screen is

this study was sampled from an observation well ez 112 that is an artesian well the well is cut through the alluvial aquifer of the dead sea fig 1 to a depth of 40 m and is screened at depths of 31 to 36 m in a gravel layer that layer is confined by upper and lower impermeable clay layers with thicknesses of 3 and 1 m respectively seawater from the desalination plant in ashkelon fig 1 was also sampled and examined the desalination plant started operating in 2006 and produces 100 million m3 y 1 of potable water the supplementary materials include detailed descriptions of the different sampling sites and aquifers 2 2 water sampling and field procedures sgw in the nitsanim and eilat sampling campaigns was collected with a submersible pump grundfos bjerringbro denmark in the ein feshkha dead sea sampling campaign a pump was not needed due to the artesian nature of the well seawater was collected from the inlet of the ashkelon desalination plant to sample the feed water source of an industrial seawater desalination plant sgw was sampled in an inert environment by collecting the water in a 200 l tank filled with nitrogen gas during water sampling the gas was released from the tank through an outlet pipe and a gas trap for eilat and ein feshkha waters half of the sampled volume 100 l was kept inert as described and the other half was oxidized by opening the tank and

sw30hr dow filmtec at a constant pressure while monitoring the permeate flux decline the ro filtration system is shown schematically in fig 2 the large water tank 200 l of sgw or seawater sampled in the field was kept in an inert atmosphere n2 during the sampling and during the filtration experiment and was mixed by a small circulation pump immersed in the tank for the oxidized waters no nitrogen atmosphere was applied the filtration system was operated in a feed and bleed mode feed water was pumped from the 200 l tank at 100 ml min 1 into the ro system by a peristaltic pump mrc while the permeate and concentrate were recycled back into a small water tank 10 l fig 2 water was drained from the small tank at a rate flux equal to the inlet flux 100 ml min 1 that maintained a constant

the feed brine circulation flow was set to 1 3 l min 1 cross flow velocity of 0 24 m sec 1 to obtain an overall similar ratio between the shear and the drag forces on the membrane 2 5 membrane autopsy

compositions of specific particles 3 results and discussion 3 1 water chemistry and redox conditions sgw from three different coastal aquifers and seawater from the intake pipe of the ashkelon desalination plant prior to treatment were sampled fig 1 all sgws were sampled several meters below the fsi and their water chemistries were analyzed table 1 the average salinity measurement total dissolved solids tds for all the sgw samples was around 30 ppt compared with the 42 ppt of the eastern mediterranean seawater indicating some mixing with the fresh groundwater body the slightly lower average salinity observed in the sgw samples which was close to that of the nearby seawater is typical to the levels of salinity in many other sgws from coastal aquifers around the world russak and sivan 2010 sivan et al 2005 yechieli et al 2009 the ion concentrations of the sgw from all three aquifers were however deviated from simple mixing with fresh groundwater the simple mixing was calculated using the concentration of the cl ion see si equation s5 which was shown to be a conservative chemical specie in those coastal aquifers and mimics the tds of the water avrahamov et al 2010 russak and sivan 2010 among the non conservative ions in the sgw are ca2 na k and sr2 compared with the relative concentrations of ca2 in the seawater samples those in the sgws of nitsanim and eilat were enriched exhibiting increases from 11 45 mm in the mediterranean sea to 15 2 mm in nitsanim and from 12 2 mm in the gulf of aqaba lazar et al 2004 to 15 2 mm in eilat groundwater na showed the opposite trend and it was depleted in the sgws of nitsanim and eilat 460 mm and 325 mm respectively compared with seawater concentrations in the mediterranean sea and in the red sea 592 mm and 561 mm respectively al ouran 2005 which were 6 and 10 below conservative mixing these processes of depletion and enrichment are caused mainly by cation exchange in aquifers due to salinization and freshening events russak and sivan 2010 other geochemical processes such as the dissolution and precipitation of minerals e g caco3 which occur during salinization or freshening events affect also the chemical composition of the water andersen et al 2005 barker et al 1998 magaritz and luzier 1985 price and herman 1991 russak and sivan 2010 wicks et al 1995 wicks and herman 1996 at ein feshkha the discrepancies between the sgw and seawater concentrations of various ions due to simple mixing in the aquifer may possibly be attributed to the precipitation of different minerals such as gypsum kiro et al 2013 celestine and barite kiro et al 2012 in the fsi zone an additional process that has marked effect on the ion compositions of the different groundwater types is biogeochemical mediated organic matter oxidation in many sgws it has been shown that intensive organic matter oxidation by oxygen leads to its depletion and subsequently suboxic to anoxic conditions indeed the oxygen levels measured in each of our studied aquifers were from 0 to 0 13 mg l 1 and the obtained orp values were negative 60 230 mv table 1 the negative orp values found in ein feshkha were the lowest of the sample sites followed by eilat and then nitsanim and all of the sites exhibited anaerobic respiration processes anaerobic oxidation of organic matter releases hco3 thus elevating the dic concentration and alkalinity by the same ratio aerobic oxidation of organic matter in contrast releases mainly co2 but has almost no effect on the alkalinity sivan et al 2005 in all three groundwater systems organic matter was most likely oxidized anaerobically which was evidenced by the increase in both alkalinity and dic by a ratio of 1 fig 3 a the trend corresponds only to the reduced samples it can also be seen that the increases in alkalinity and dic were accompanied by lower δ13cdic values fig 3b this association supports intense microbial oxidation of organic carbon in which the light carbon isotope is preferable appelo and postma 2005 this suggests that the ein feshkha aquifer has the most intense microbial activity of the examined aquifers and that the eilat site has the lowest microbial activity another explanation for the low δ13cdic of ein feshkha can be attributed to the relative high dilution of the dead sea water with value of 0 with fresh groundwater with low value of 10 o even though it possesses similar salinities with the other coastal aquifers the total organic carbon toc found in the aquifers also supports the conclusion of intense microbial activity as the aquifer in ein feshkha possessed the highest toc concentration 2 ppm relative to the aquifers in nitsanim 1 12 ppm and in eilat 0 5 ppm table 1 the low bacterial activity of the red sea coastal aquifer can be explained by the oligotrophic nature of the red sea reiss and hottinger 2012 the different extents of organic carbon oxidation that led to varied redox conditions observed in the three aquifers may also lead to the dominance of correspondingly different anaerobic microbial respiration processes in the aquifers stumm and morgan 2012 previous studies of the mediterranean coastal aquifer at nitsanim found that denitrification was the dominant process for anaerobic bacterial respiration russak et al 2015 sivan et al 2005 in the current study the concentrations detected for nitrate 80 µm nitrite 0 9 µm and ammonium 2 4 µm matched the redox condition denitrification that was found within the fsi zone fig 4 and table 1 the concentrations of ammonium and nitrite in the sgw were higher than their concentrations in seawater this is expected for anaerobic conditions when ammonium is not oxidized and denitrification takes place nitrite is an intermediate species in this process furthermore ferrous and manganese were not detected in the sgw of nitsanim and the sulfate concentration was that expected from simple mixing dilution of seawater fig 4a implying that the redox stage in this aquifer had only reached denitrification and not sulfate reduction the aquifer in eilat showed no depletion in sulfate and no dissolved iron or manganese moreover it contained 50 µm of nitrate 0 47 µm of nitrite and 0 58 µm of ammonium table 1 these findings suggest the presence of mutual microbial nitrification and denitrification processes but these occur at low rates due to the low organic matter content of the groundwater in the ein feshkha coastal aquifer nitrogen compounds comprised a very low concentration of nitrate 0 1 µm a high concentration of ammonium 4 5 µm and a relatively high concentration of nitrite 0 6 µm table 1 fig 4b d these findings suggest that the redox conditions enable the occurrence of denitrification however dissolved manganese 1 4 µm and iron 4 3 µm were also found at this site indicating that the redox stage has reached reduction of manganese and iron oxides furthermore the sulfide concentration of 32 2 µm and a sulfate concentration that was lower than expected from simple mixing of dead sea water fig 4a imply that sulfate reduction is occurring although the coexistence of sulfide and fe2 is uncommon due to their tendency to precipitate as iron monosulfide and pyrite canfield 1989 kraal et al 2013 previous studies reported their coexistence in other coastal aquifers e g georgia delaware and south korea kim et al 2014 mcallister et al 2015 snyder et al 2004 yet another study showed by measuring methane and sulfate concentrations and their isotopes that sulfate reduction in the dead sea coastal aquifer was coupled to the anaerobic oxidation of methane avrahamov et al 2014 which in this aquifer may be produced in deep layers avrahamov et al 2015 it can therefore be concluded that the redox stage of the ein feshkha aquifer has favored sulfate reduction 3 2 ro desalination and fouling experiments with the different water types fouling experiments were conducted in the ro cross flow filtration system fig 2 to evaluate the fouling potential of seawater and of the sgw sampled from the different coastal aquifers the desalination experiments with the three sgw types were conducted in their natural anaerobic conditions by keeping the water samples under nitrogen atmosphere during the experiment furthermore the oxidized sgw of ein feshkha and eilat were tested as well to determine the potential outcome of oxidation of the feed water prior to the desalination process flat sheet commercial ro membranes sw30hr membrane were first compacted with a nacl solution for 24 h with 50 bars of pressure and initial flux of 30 l m 2 h 1 the filtration experiments of the different water types started with an initial permeate flux j0 of 29 8 3 6 l m 2 h 1 by adjusting the applied pressure due to the difference in water salinities and the permeate flux over time was recorded at constant pressure the results from the seawater experiment showed that the permeate flux declined from the initial value to an average of 20 1 l m 2 h 1 j j0 of 0 75 during 8 h which represents a 34 reduction fig 5 the desalination with all the sgw types showed better performance than that with seawater as a result of the lower fouling propensity of the sgw compared to that of the seawater which resulted in accordingly smaller reductions in flux under sgw desalination the experiment with the sgw from the mediterranean coastal aquifer nitsanim showed a permeate flux decline of 10 fig 5 the higher fouling propensity of mediterranean seawater compared with the low fouling propensity of sgw from the nearby coastal aquifer nitsanim was observed in a previous study stein et al 2016 and is in agreement with the flux decline observed in the current study the experiment with the sgw from the red sea coastal aquifer eilat showed a flux reduction of 8 fig 5 the experiment with the sgw from the dead sea coastal aquifer ein feshkha stabilized at an average normalized flux of 0 92 which is an 8 reduction from the initial flux as in the eilat aquifer despite the different redox stages of the nitsanim and eilat sgws compared to that of the ein feshkha sgw all three aquifers showed generally the same reduction in flux the lower fouling propensity of sgw is a major benefit of using it rather than seawater as the feed for desalination the lower applied pressure required in sgw desalination translates into reduced energy demand less membrane cleaning and lower operational costs evaluation of the sdi values for the sgw of nitsanim eilat and ein feshkha showed 4 6 5 44 and 0 91 min 1 respectively which are lower than the sdi of seawater 6 35 min 1 table 1 a sensitive parameter sdi can be used to predict fouling potential mosset et al 2008 and indeed in this study the seawater had a higher sdi and showed a higher fouling propensity than the sgw samples in some cases such as in almeria and saudi arabia the natural filtration of the aquifer reduces the sdi values by more than 90 rachman et al 2014 sola et al 2013 other possible causes for the higher fouling of seawater compared with that of sgw are the oxygen levels and the presence of transparent exopolymer particles that are secreted by marine microorganisms in seawater bar zeev et al 2009 the lower oxygen levels in sgw than in seawater table 1 is beneficial as it inhibits biofilm production on the membrane and was shown to prolong membrane life span beyer et al 2014 in our experiment although significant biofouling is not expected during the operation of the ro experiments the potentially reduced biofouling propensity of sgw may be an additional important advantage for continuous ro desalination practices the sgws of eilat and ein feshkha were oxidized by opening the tank and stirring for 24 h after which the do of the water was at saturation ro filtration experiments were then conducted with the oxidized waters the experiment with the oxidized water of eilat showed a permeate flux decline that reached an average flux of 27 1 l m 2 h 1 which is a 13 reduction from the initial flux j j0 of 0 87 fig 5 the flux decline of the oxidized sgw of eilat was larger than the flux decline found for the natural reduced water of eilat permeate flux during the ro filtration of the ein feshkha oxidized water was reduced to 26 6 l m 2 h 1 j j0 of 0 88 which is a 12 reduction in flux fig 5 similar to our findings for the oxidized eilat water in tests of the ein feshkha water a greater reduction in flux was obtained with the oxidized compared with the natural reduced state water the higher fouling levels observed for the oxidized compared with the natural reduced waters of both eilat and ein feshkha imply that the redox stages of the waters may influence their fouling propensities in the ro desalination process the oxidation of naturally reduced water can cause precipitation due to changes in the solution chemistry where reduced species that are naturally dissolved may precipitate due to the change of their oxidation state also the enhanced fouling and scaling of the oxidized waters can be attributed to the increased ph values of the two aquifer waters the natural ph values of eilat and ein feshkha are 7 06 and 6 75 respectively while after the oxidation process those values were elevated to 7 5 and 7 7 respectively these observed increases in ph which are attributed to co2 release to the atmosphere during the oxidation stage may cause mineral precipitation especially of carbonates whose solubility decreases at high ph values indeed caco3 precipitation was observed in the water tank confirmed by x ray diffraction xrd analysis fig s1 during the 24 h oxidation of the ein feshkha water which exhibited the largest change in ph the ca2 and the dic concentrations of the oxidized ein feshkha water were lower than in the natural reduced form table 1 findings that are in agreement with the caco3 precipitation hence both the change in the redox stage and with the increase in ph upon oxidation contributed to the increased fouling propensity of the oxidized water 3 3 characteristics of the fouling layer on the ro membranes to study the fouling properties of each water type the fouled membranes from each experiment were examined the ionic compositions of the foulants were determined by dissolving the precipitates in a fixed volume of nitric acid followed by icp measurement the membrane of the seawater desalination experiment showed a high silicon content and relatively high levels of sulfur iron and magnesium table 2 silicon and iron were also observed by surface elemental analysis by xps of the seawater membrane table s1 the observation that silicon and iron were observed in high concentrations on the fouled membrane but were below the detection limit in the feed seawater indicates their being aggregated and concentrated on the membrane during the ro filtration process other studies detected silicate and iron fouling during seawater desalination aubry et al 2014 li et al 2012 and in some cases the fouling resulted from the dissolved ionic forms of silicates and iron li et al 2012 when these were present recent review articles indicated that the most common foulant types of seawater ro desalination are colloidal iron and silica badruzzaman et al 2019 jiang et al 2017 generally iron fouling on ro membranes is mostly colloidal usually as silicates ning 2009 the foulant composition of the membrane used in the nitsanim natural reduced sgw experiment showed high contents of silicon calcium and magnesium table 2 in this case it is plausible that colloidal magnesium silicates were the dominant foulants due to the sand stone dominance in this aquifer the fouling layer of the eilat reduced sgw ro experiment was dominated by calcium and it had relatively equal depositions of magnesium sulfur and silicon calcium sulfur and silicon were also detected by the xps surface analysis table s1 these elements probably originated from the magmatic and metamorphic crystalline host rocks of the alluvial aquifer in eilat sem analysis shows depositions of aluminosilicates with high iron content including iron particles in the µm size range fig s2 the ionic profiles of the membrane depositions from the ro experiment with the oxidized eilat water were similar to those of its natural reduced form table 2 and sem analysis detected particle deposition with the above elements fig s3 the oxidation of the eilat water did not substantially change the chemical composition of the feed water table 1 which is in agreement with similar fouling properties of eilat natural and oxidized waters the membrane from the ro experiment with the ein feshkha natural water was fouled mainly with calcium and magnesium with silicon deposits table 2 xps surface analysis shows a similar trend of finding calcium magnesium and silicon on the membrane table s1 the fouled membrane from the experiment of oxidized ein feshkha water shows a similar deposition pattern namely mostly calcium and magnesium with additional silicon but in this case the calcium and magnesium were present in much higher concentrations table 2 this finding is probably due to the formation of calcium and magnesium precipitates in the oxidized groundwater as discussed above for caco3 and it agrees with the more intense fouling observed for the oxidized water fig 5 ferrous iron is often observed in anoxic groundwaters but when these are exposed to the partial pressure of oxygen in the atmosphere it is oxidized and precipitates as ferric hydroxide within minutes to hours sung and forbes 1984 in the natural reduced ein feshkha water iron was in its dissolved reduced form however oxidation of the water did not significantly increase the level of iron deposition on the membrane probably due to its low concentration in the bulk ein feshkha water 4 µm table 1 sulfur was detected in higher concentrations on the membrane of the oxidized experiment compared with the natural reduced form of the ein feshkha water this may be due to the behavior of dissolved reduced sulfur sulfide as hs 32 2 µm in ein feshkha sgw table 1 and the deposition of elemental sulfur when oxidized a coastal aquifer in delaware bay was found to have dissolved ferrous iron concentrations of 1000 µm and sulfide concentrations of up to 466 µm mcallister et al 2015 that upon oxidation may strongly precipitate these findings indicate that the redox stage of coastal aquifers may have a marked impact on ro processes therefore to predict the potential fouling and associated challenges of applying the ro system in the treatment of saline groundwaters it is essential that the concentrations of the redox species present in the water and their dynamics be accurately measured and fully understood ning et al showed that running an ro desalination plant with feed water from an aquifer in bahrein that contained 90 µm of sulfide resulted in severe elemental sulfur fouling within two days of starting operation ning et al 2005 saturation index calculations for different minerals in the studied water types were performed by phreeqc software parkhurst and appelo 1999 taking into account the concentration polarization in the ro system used for the filtration experiments table 3 in addition the si includes further explanation about the calculations for concentration polarization and salt rejection fig s2 in general almost all of the minerals presented in table 3 had higher saturation index values for the oxidized sgw than for the natural reduced form all water types exhibited a tendency for the precipitation of caco3 aragonite and calcite and calcium magnesium carbonate huntite camg3 co3 4 thus scaling by these minerals can explain the calcium and magnesium deposits that were found on all membranes silicate minerals such as talc antigorite and quartz were each found to have a positive saturation index in all experiments besides those with seawater because silicon was not detected in the seawater thus silicates are a potential scaling factor in the sgw desalination process in the oxidized ein feshkha water the silicate mineral anthophyllite was found to have a positive saturation index interestingly iron minerals such as goethite and pyrite had high positive saturation index values in the natural reduced ein feshkha water elemental sulfur deposition is likely to occur both in ein feshkha natural water and in its oxidized form which had sulfide concentrations of 32 2 and 1 53 µm respectively sem analyses indicated the presence of sulfur dominated spots on the membranes used for the natural and oxidized ein feshkha water filtrations figures s4 and s5 4 conclusions the findings of this work show how the natural redox stage of sgws from coastal aquifers affects the performance of ro desalination in addition this study demonstrates the benefits of sgw desalination over seawater desalination the natural reducing conditions of the sgw have major implications for the ro process as it results in a lower fouling propensity compared with the oxidized form of the water and the seawater maintenance of the natural reducing stage of the water may prevent precipitation by keeping the iron and sulfur species in their reduced dissolved forms and by reducing the saturation index of relevant minerals thereby reducing the membrane scaling phenomenon one of the principal conclusions from this study therefore is the importance of preventing the feed water from being exposed to atmospheric conditions due to their potential oxidation and to co2 release and a subsequent rise in ph that was shown to enhance mineral precipitation keeping the groundwater in its natural state will reduce the total cost of the ro process as the need for feed stream pretreatments is reduced significantly this work shows that low redox stage of the feed water improves desalination performance reduced conditions cause less fouling where different redox levels of anaerobic natural waters have comparable ro system performance the sgws from nitsanim and eilat were found to be in a denitrification stage while ein feshkha was in a sulfate reduction stage but all three water types showed comparable fouling propensities fig 5b using naturally reduced sgws from coastal aquifers as the feed water for ro desalination may result in reduced membrane fouling thus ameliorating the associated problems and costs typically encountered during ro process operation these findings together with the lower salinity of the sgw relative to seawater indicate that the use of sgw in ro desalination systems may reduce the energy demand and overall operational costs of the ro process declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

17423,we analyzed mid to long term 137cs wash off from the catchments contaminated due to the chernobyl accident in 1986 and the fukushima dai ichi nuclear power plant accident in 2011 a semi empirical diffusional model for radionuclide wash off is proposed to enable estimation of the dissolved and particulate 137cs wash off ratios for the chernobyl and fukushima contaminated catchments the differences in the wash off characteristics for these two regions are explained and their long term trends predicted the model is based on the premise that the catchment topsoil layer is the source of sediments in the rivers and the radionuclide concentration in the topsoil can be described by a simple diffusion equation the particulate 137cs wash off ratios for the fukushima contaminated catchments appear to be comparable or slightly lower than those for chernobyl the dissolved 137cs wash off ratios for fukushima catchments are at least an order of magnitude lower than those for chernobyl mainly due to an order of magnitude difference in the 137cs distribution coefficients for the fukushima and chernobyl rivers the proposed semi empirical diffusional model for radionuclide wash off satisfactorily describes the temporal trends in the 137cs wash off characteristics for both the chernobyl and fukushima cases and can be used as a tool for predicting 137cs wash off after a nuclear accident graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords chernobyl fukushima dissolved particulate radiocesium wash off 1 introduction in the event of a major nuclear accident radioactive contamination of water bodies and rivers running through the contaminated areas becomes a concern since these are usually a source of drinking water for the public and used for fishing and irrigation in 1986 as a result of the chernobyl accident extensive areas of the dnieper river basin including the watershed of its right tributary the pripyat river were contaminated with the long lived radionuclides 137cs and 90sr having half lives of about 30 years borzilov et al 1988 konoplev et al 1992 through transport by the river systems radionuclides are distributed beyond the initially contaminated areas and across boundaries iaea 2006 likewise after the fukushima dai ichi nuclear power plant fdnpp accident in 2011 the river basins of the abukuma mano niida ohta ukedo maeda kuma and others evrard et al 2015 konoplev 2016 taniguchi et al 2019 yoshimura et al 2015 flowing into the pacific ocean were exposed to contamination with 137cs transported both in a particulate and dissolved state the principal long term process leading to secondary contamination of natural waters is radionuclide wash off from contaminated land borzilov et al 1988 garcia sanchez 2008 konoplev et al 1996 2016a the issue of wash off from contaminated watersheds is on the priority list starting from studies of environmental behavior of radionuclides originated from nuclear weapon tests and kyshtym accident bobovnikova et al 1977 makhon ko et al 1977 pavlotskaya 1974 pisarev et al 1972 onishi et al 1981 following the chernobyl accident major advances were made in parameterization of radionuclide wash off from contaminated watersheds konoplev et al 1992 after the fukushima accident 137cs wash off characteristics from the contaminated catchments were compared with those for chernobyl for the initial phase konoplev 2016 it was demonstrated that the dissolved 137cs transfer from soil to surface runoff was much lower in fukushima than in chernobyl which was also confirmed by taniguchi et al 2019 in the present study the dynamics of 137cs wash off from contaminated catchments following the two major nuclear accidents is analyzed over a more extended period based on a semi empirical model coupling radionuclide wash off and river transport with its migration in catchment soils util now the processes of vertical migration in catchment soil wash off and river transport were considered separately irrespective of each other herein an integrated approach is implemented based on analysis of key physical chemical processes rather than using empirical approximations the behavior of accidentally released radionuclides in the environment is determined by their properties and environmental characteristics which are key for their mobility and bioavailability konoplev 2020 the climate and geographical conditions for fukushima prefecture of japan and the chernobyl contaminated areas of ukraine belarus and russia display substantial differences the catchments of the chernobyl zone are flat and characterized by minor slopes whereas fukushima s catchments are mainly hilly and have relatively steep slopes annual precipitation also differs markedly and is more than 2 times higher in the fdnpp area 1420 mm laceby et al 2016 than at chernobyl 625 mm konoplev 2016 besides in fukushima region high flow events in rivers occur especially during typhoon s season which facilitate radionuclide wash off from contaminated catchments and its lateral migration evrard et al 2014 konoplev et al 2018 nagao et al 2013 yamashiki et al 2014 the soils of the fukushima and chernobyl contaminated areas differ markedly the chernobyl soils are made of outwash sands and alluvial deposits mainly of loamy sand composition containing a lower proportion of silty fraction as compared to the fukushima region parent rock materials in fukushima are primarily granites and volcanic ashes that are subject to physico chemical weathering in the humid monsoon climate conditions the proportion of clays is 20 30 in fukushima which is higher than in the sandy loam soils of the chernobyl area even though the sand fraction makes 40 50 in both fukushima and chernobyl on the average in addition to geoclimatic differences the speciation of initially deposited 137cs at fukushima and chernobyl differed the principal distinction of the chernobyl fallout was that a considerable fraction of 137cs up to 75 was embedded in water insoluble fuel particles bobovnikova et al 1991 konoplev et al 1992 therefore the 137cs speciation in the fallout was a function of distance from the chernobyl npp since fuel particles were mostly deposited in the vicinity of the reactor and 137cs transported over long distances was incorporated into fine condensation particles konoplev and bulgakov 1999 137cs was leached from fuel particles over time due to their decomposition and oxidation konoplev and bulgakov 1999 konoplev 2020 after the fdnpp accident 137cs was first believed to have deposited in a mobile state as water soluble sulfates kaneyasu et al 2012 later however data became available indicating that a fraction of 137cs up to 40 and even more deposited as glassy water insoluble cs rich microparticles csmp ikehara et al 2020 environmental leaching from these particles is much slower than that from the chernobyl derived fuel particles okumura et al 2019 in fukushima compared to chernobyl particulate 137cs flux is predominant konoplev et al 2016a nagao et al 2013 ochiai et al 2015 ueda et al 2013 in our view this is associated with two factors first 137cs in fukushima is stronger bound to soil particles and sediments in contrast to chernobyl which is enhanced by the presence of water insoluble csmp konoplev 2015 nakanishi and sakuma 2019 taniguchi et al 2019 yoshimura et al 2015 second the greater annual precipitation with extreme floods during typhoons and much higher average inclinations of typical catchments in fukushima compared to chernobyl lead to more significant erosion of the topsoil layer and wash off of particulate 137cs strongly bound to topsoil particles evrard et al 2014 konoplev 2016 laceby et al 2016 nagao et al 2013 another hypothesis was also discussed in the literature naulier et al 2017 suggested that particulate organic matter could have contributed significantly to the increased particulate concentrations of radiocesium in river sediments this hypothesis however is different from the prevalent and generally accepted view in post chernobyl radioecology regarding the role of organic matter in radiocesium dynamics valcke and cremers 1994 some of post fukushima studies have not confirmed this either iwagami et al 2017 and hence this hypothesis requires further investigation thus the difference in the initial speciation of 137cs in chernobyl and fukushima as well as the difference in the composition of the soils that govern radionuclide selective sorption and fixation along with the difference in geoclimatic conditions are responsible for the differences in characteristics of 137cs wash off from the contaminated catchments 2 theoretical background 2 1 quantitative characteristics of radionuclide wash off and their parameterization the most important quantitative characteristic of radionuclide wash off used for predicting secondary contamination of water bodies is the wash off coefficient representing the fraction of radionuclide inventory in the catchment transported by surface runoff to water bodies bobovnikova et al 1977 borzilov et al 1988 makhon ko et al 1977 pisarev et al 1972 in surface runoff radionuclides can occur in dissolved and particulate forms since the physicochemical state of the radionuclide to a great extent determines its further behavior in surface waters dissolved and particulate wash off should be considered separately the particulate wash off coefficient wp and dissolved wash off coefficient wd represent the fractions of radionuclide washed off from the catchment as suspended particles and in solution respectively they are determined for the period of interest or a single runoff event and are defined as follows borzilov et al 1988 garcia sanchez and konoplev 2009 konoplev 2016 1 w p 0 t c p t m t d t s σ s d s c p m σ s w d 0 t c d t q t d t s σ s d s c d v σ s where cp t and c p are the instantaneous and weighted average radionuclide activity concentrations on suspended particles bq g respectively m t and м are the erosion rate g s and the sediment yield g for the period of interest or the single runoff event cd t and c d are the instantaneous and weighted average radionuclide concentrations in solution bq l q t is the runoff rate l s v is the total runoff volume l σ s is the local radionuclide deposition for the watershed section ds bq m2 σ is the radionuclide mean deposition over the entire catchment area bq m2 s is the catchment area m2 0 and t are the starting time and duration of the runoff event or the period of interest s respectively and t is time s for practical application the wash off coefficients have been normalized through the runoff characteristics essential for radionuclide wash off for dissolved wash off this is the runoff volume divided by the area of catchment i e runoff layer while the particulate wash off coefficient is proportional to the sediment yield from the catchment area borzilov et al 1988 konoplev et al 1992 dividing wd by the runoff layer and wp by the mass of eroded material from the area unit we get the normalized dissolved and particulate wash off coefficients which according to eq 1 are equal to the ratio of the corresponding mean activity concentration and the average deposition of the radionuclide on the catchment 2 n d w d h w d s v c d σ n p w p q w p s m с p σ where is h is the runoff depth m q is the mass of eroded material from the catchment area g m2 nd is the normalized dissolved wash off coefficient m 1 for the period of interest and np is the normalized particulate wash off coefficient m2 g for the period of interest we will refer to these parameters as nd dissolved wash off ratio and np particulate wash off ratio the proportionality of the dissolved wash off coefficient wd and runoff depth was noted in early studies of radionuclide wash off resulting from the global nuclear weapon tests fallout rovinsky et al 1976 1979 to study the time dependence of wash off characteristics the use of instantaneous wash off ratios is convenient bulgakov et al 1991a 3 n d c d t σ n p c p t σ a major advantage of the wash off ratios is that they can be used to predict the radionuclide wash off from contaminated catchments and their concentrations in rivers and other water bodies borzilov et al 1989 1993 to estimate the fraction of the radionuclide washed off in solution the dissolved wash off ratio is multiplied by the expected runoff depth for a given runoff event or period of interest the fraction of radionuclide washed off with sediments is estimated by multiplying the particulate wash off ratio by the predicted sediment yield during the runoff event or period of interest borzilov et al 1988 konoplev et al 1992 this is how the contamination of surface waters due to snowmelt or rainfall floods after the chernobyl accident was predicted in the early phase borzilov et al 1989 1993 2 2 semi empirical modeling of long term dynamics of radionuclide wash off from contaminated catchments the main source of suspended particles for surface runoff is the top layer of catchment soil multiple studies of wash off of contaminants of different nature have shown that the depth of the soil layer from which the contaminant is effectively transferred to the surface runoff is several millimeters up to 1 cm ahuja et al 1981 borzilov et al 1989 bulgakov et al 1991a 2000 donigian et al 1977 knisel 1980 the radionuclide concentration in topsoil decreases over time due to its vertical migration to deeper soil layers the analysis of the vertical distribution of radionuclides such as 137cs and 241am strongly bound to soil particles has indicated that as late as 30 years after the chernobyl accident the highest concentrations of these radionuclides occurred in the top layer of undisturbed meadow and forest soils konoplev et al 2020 therefore the vertical migration of 137cs in soil after a one time fallout from the atmosphere as is the case with a nuclear accident with certain simplifications can be approximated by a quasi diffusional model bulgakov et al 1991b 2000 ivanov et al 1997 konoplev et al 2020 4 c s t σ 0 ρ π d e f f t e x 2 4 d e f f λ t where σ 0 is the initial average deposition of radionuclide on the catchment deff is the effective dispersion coefficient λ is the radioactive decay rate constant ρ is the average bulk density of the topsoil over the catchment x is the depth from the soil surface and t is time in this case the time dependence of radionuclide concentration in the topsoil layer at x 0 and hence on suspended particles entrained by the surface runoff is approximated by the equation konoplev et al 2020 5 c p t σ ρ π d eff t e λ t here it is assumed that radionuclide deposition and land use types are uniform across the catchment area the dissolved radionuclide concentration in the surface runoff or river is related to the particulate radionuclide concentration through the distribution coefficient k d which by definition is the ratio of these concentrations at equilibrium iaea 2010 konoplev 2015 6 k d t c p t c d t more than 30 years of 137cs monitoring in the major rivers pripyat and dnieper of the chernobyl zone has shown that after the early phase 1 2 years the k d 137cs value displayed some variation but no statistically significant trend was observed konoplev et al 2020 then with allowance for eqs 5 and 6 the time dependence of dissolved 137cs concentration in a river can be approximated by the equation konoplev et al 2020 7 c d t σ ρ k d π d e f f t e λ t substituting eqs 5 and 7 into eq 3 and assuming the 137cs deposition in the catchment decreases with time only due to radioactive decay i e ignoring the minor losses due to wash off soil plant transfer and wind resuspension with subsequent atmospheric transport we get 8 n p t 1 ρ π d e f f t n p 0 t n p 0 ρ π d e f f 1 9 n d t 1 ρ k d π d e f f t n d 0 t n d 0 ρ k d π d e f f 1 eqs 8 and 9 estimate the wash off ratios after the early phase of a nuclear accident and predict the mid and long term dynamics of radionuclide wash off it should be emphasized that the equations are not applicable for the first days weeks and months after the accident because at t 0 eqs 8 and 9 are meaningless the merit of the proposed semi empirical diffusional approach is that it enables prediction of the radionuclide wash off and secondary contamination of surface waters for the mid and long term phases after a nuclear accident using only two key physicochemical parameters of radionuclide dispersion and distribution in the sediment water system the main parameter determining particulate radionuclide wash off is the effective dispersion coefficient deff for catchment topsoil which depends on radionuclide chemical properties sorption and fixation ability of catchment soil and climatic conditions e g mean annual rainfall mean annual air temperature etc another critical parameter controlling dissolved radionuclide wash off besides deff is the distribution coefficient kd in the sediment water system these parameters can be estimated from literature data regarding vertical migration of radionuclides in soil and their distribution in the sediment water system bulgakov et al 1991b 2000 ivanov et al 1997 konoplev 2015 konoplev et al 2016b the values n p 0 and n d 0 can also be derived from monitoring data of the first few years after the accident and then used for mid and long term predictions an alternative approach to modeling the dynamics of radionuclide wash off is application of an empirical multi exponential transfer function his empirical model was developed and widely used in post chernobyl studies garcia sanchez 2008 hilton et al 1997 monte et al 2004 smith et al 2005 such an approach was followed by a number of researchers in post fukushima investigations of radiocesium dynamics in rivers funaki et al 2020 iwagami et al 2017 nakanishi and sakuma 2019 taniguchi et al 2019 in our view the semi empirical diffusional model proposed in this work has important advantages as compared to the empirical multi exponential model first the diffusional model has only two parameters deff and kd which have a clear physical meaning second it integrates the processes of radionuclide migration in catchment soils with the processes of its wash off and river transport notably the proposed here diffusional model is valid for long lived radionuclides strongly bound to soil particles such as 137cs but cannot be applied to short lived radioisotopes and radionuclides passing into solution easily as the conditions are not met in such cases also the basic assumption of the model that the main source of sediments in surface runoff is the topsoil layer can be invalid in some cases for fukushima for instance huon et al 2018 claimed that up to 25 of deposited sediments in the mano dam reservoir in fukushima come from subsoil however the sources of sediments for surface runoff and dam deposits can be different and the above proportion can be overestimation for surface runoff we do realize that our assumption is to some extent a limitation of the model and may not always be fulfilled in specific circumstances of fukushima especially in case of extreme floods etc and hence some model predictions can deviate from observations such deviations however are not expected to be significant for averaged characteristics one of the purposes of this work was to evaluate the relevance of this simplification another constraint is associated with potential impact of remediation the model is based on the assumption that radionuclide concentration in the topsoil layer changes due to natural environmental processes in case of remediation the natural environment is disturbed and strictly speaking application of the model becomes problematic if the scale and efficacy of remediation for a specific catchment is known its impact can be allowed for through certain corrections 3 study sites to test the proposed semi empirical diffusional model of radionuclide wash off the 137cs monitoring data for the contaminated river systems after the chernobyl and fukushima accidents were used for the chernobyl zone data were collected for the rivers pripyat and dnieper in the case of the pripyat river the cross sections under study were mozyr belarus and chernobyl ukraine for the dnieper river the cross sections rechitsa belarus and nedanchichi ukraine were studied fig 1 although the areas contaminated after the chernobyl accident are more extensive than those in fukushima they still occupy a minor part of dnieper and pripyat catchments and thus average 137cs deposition is rather low as compared to the smaller fukushima catchments table 1 for all the chernobyl zone cross sections investigated data for 1987 2001 from the database db runoff were used the db runoff was developed as part of program 2 radioecology of the french german initiative for chernobyl which was led by institute for radiological protection and nuclear safety irsn france and institute for plant and reactor safety grs fgi 2006 the database contains detailed information on radionuclide transfer by surface runoff for heavily contaminated catchments in belarus russia and ukraine general characteristics of the contaminated watersheds such as meteorology hydrology soils radionuclide deposition and radionuclide concentrations in 5 large rivers including the dnieper and pripyat and 17 smaller rivers together with their hydrochemical characteristics are available in the database detailed description of the database can be found in konoplev et al 2002a the db runoff is owned by irsn and grs and can be requested from them for 2002 2017 the monitoring data by ukrainian state specialized enterprise ecocenter and ukrainian hydrometeorological institute uhmi were used for the chernobyl cross section for the nedanchichi cross section data for 2002 2017 were obtained from the uhmi and central geophysical observatory kiev ukraine for the monitoring period 2002 2017 data of belarus hydrometeorological service for the cross sections mozyr pripyat and rechitsa dnieper were taken from regular annual reports for 2003 2017 such as shershakov et al 2018 and earlier issues available at http www rpatyphoon ru products pollution media php data for 137cs activity concentrations in the rivers at studied cross sections have been published recently konoplev et al 2020 voitsekhovych et al 2016 based on the monitoring data the mean annual 137cs concentrations in the rivers were determined notably after the chernobyl accident the primary focus of the monitoring system was on dissolved radionuclides as they were mainly transported in solution konoplev 2016 whereas reliable data about the particulate 137cs were not available for many rivers and cross sections furthermore the particulate 137cs concentrations were sometimes measured in bq l which precluded credible estimation of the particulate wash off characteristics trustworthy data from long term monitoring of particulate 137cs is only available for two cross sections chernobyl pripyat and nedanchichi dnieper the situation in the fdnpp zone differed markedly the contribution of particulate 137cs was higher than that of dissolved 137cs and data on particulate 137cs activity concentrations in rivers and on topsoil erosion started to be collected shortly after the accident evrard et al 2015 yoshimura et al 2015 for comparative analysis we calculated the characteristics of 137cs wash off from the ukedo river and ohta river catchments two of the most contaminated rivers in the fdnpp zone based on the dissolved and particulate 137cs monitoring data nakanishi and sakuma 2019 which were added by data from taniguchi et al 2019 yoshimura et al 2015 about 60 of these rivers catchments are occupied by forests 33 40 are occupied by grass and bare fields including abandoned farmlands and paddy fields taniguchi et al 2019 table 1 these catchments can be categorized as highly contaminated the mean 137cs depositions of these catchments 3 mbq m2 for ukedo river and 1 7 mbq m2 for ohta river nakanishi and sakuma 2019 are higher than those of the rivers pripyat and dnieper and only the sakhan river the right bank tributary of the pripyat river in the chernobyl exclusion zone has similar 137cs deposition on its catchment konoplev 2016 4 results and discussion long term monitoring of the chernobyl rivers has not revealed any time trend in the apparent kd 137cs despite distinct variations konoplev et al 2020 until now this can be also stated concerning fukushima rivers nakanishi and sakuma 2019 taniguchi et al 2019 this is illustrated by fig 2 which compares time dependences of the apparent kd 137cs in the pripyat river at chernobyl for 1990 2016 konoplev et al 2020 and in the ukedo river fukushima for 2012 2018 based on the data from nakanishi and sakuma 2019 yoshimura et al 2015 therefore a single value of the apparent kd 137cs can be taken for the whole period of observations for the pripyat river and ukedo river respectively fig 2 confirms the earlier finding that the apparent kd for fukushima rivers is about an order of magnitude higher than for chernobyl rivers konoplev 2015 and is comparable with the apparent kd value for chernobyl derived 137cs in the lake constance having distinct conditions konoplev et al 2002b fig 3 shows the mean annual values of particulate 137cs wash off ratios np for the catchments of the pripyat river at chernobyl and the dnieper river at nedanchichi in the chernobyl contaminated area based on monitoring data after 1986 konoplev et al 2020 and the rivers ukedo and ohta in the fukushima contaminated area based on data after 2011 nakanishi and sakuma 2019 the values of np 137cs were calculated using eq 2 with decay correction for the mean deposition on the catchment assuming that the temporal change in 137cs inventory was only due to radioactive decay and disregarding the contribution of wash off and wind resuspension fig 3 also shows results of estimations using the proposed semi empirical model of particulate 137cs wash off for two values of deff 0 5 cm2 year solid line and 5 cm2 year dashed line the effective dispersion coefficient for the chernobyl soils deff 137cs can be taken to be 0 5 cm2 year bulgakov et al 1991b ivanov et al 1997 konoplev et al 2016b whereas the fukushima soils are characterized by higher deff values in the range of 1 10 cm2 year konoplev et al 2016a 2016b the high variability of deff in soils leads to uncertainty in the assessment and prediction of 137cs wash off from specific catchments however this uncertainty can be reduced by conducting a large scale survey of radionuclide vertical distribution within a catchment as a function of soil type and land use obviously such a study would require huge efforts and material resources which is hardly feasible there can be several reasons for the marked difference in the particulate 137cs wash off ratios for the rivers pripyat and dnieper as shown in fig 3 the most important in our opinion is the non uniformity in the radionuclide deposition over the catchment area and hence the location of the most contaminated parts of the catchment with respect to the observational cross section as shown in fig 1 the contamination levels at the chernobyl cross section located where the pripyat river exits the chernobyl exclusion zone exceed 3000 kbq m2 the sediments freshly washed off from this most contaminated section of the catchment including highly contaminated sub catchments of smaller tributaries of the pripyat river konoplev 2016 are directly transported to the chernobyl cross section in contrast 137cs deposition in the dnieper river catchment the so called bryansk belarus cesium spot mostly occurs upstream of the dnieper river more than 100 km from the observed nedanchichi cross section the contaminated sediments of the bryansk belarus spot are transported by the river sozh and its tributaries flowing through the contaminated areas after the sozh river joins the dnieper river and down to the nedanchichi cross section the catchment section is less contaminated and the contaminated sediments from upstream are retained in the accumulation zones moreover relatively clean sediments from the uncontaminated sections enter the dnieper river here diluting and reducing particulate 137cs activity concentrations this seems to explain the lower values of the particulate 137cs wash off ratios at the nedanchichi cross section on the dnieper river compared to the chernobyl cross section on the pripyat river another possible reason for the difference in the particulate wash off characteristics for the chernobyl and nedanchichi cross sections is the difference in the mean deff values for the corresponding catchments as follows from eq 8 the value of the particulate 137cs wash off ratio is reversely proportional to d e f f for arable lands the apparent deff values are more than those for meadows forests and abandoned lands the territories adjacent to the chernobyl cross section were withdrawn from agricultural use in 1986 and the soils there have a lower deff and expected higher values of the particulate wash off ratio as shown in fig 3 the change in np over time for the pripyat river the chernobyl cross section is well described by the model at the values of deff 0 5 cm2 year whereas for the dnieper river nedanchichi the time dependence of np is described by the proposed diffusional model at deff values of 2 3 times higher the comparison with the ukedo and ohta rivers in the fdnpp zone shows that the np values for these rivers are 2 3 times lower than those for the pripyat river chernobyl and similar to those for the dnieper river nedanchichi this is consistent with the higher deff 137cs values in the fukushima soils compared to the typical deff 137cs values for the chernobyl soils which is associated with higher annual precipitation higher mean annual air temperature and higher biological activity in the fukushima soils konoplev et al 2016a 2016b the np 137cs value and its time dependence for the ukedo and ohta rivers in the fdnpp zone is in agreement with the calculations using the proposed semi empirical model at deff 137cs of about 5 cm2 year fig 4 shows the time dependence of the mean annual dissolved 137cs wash off ratios for four catchments in the chernobyl area see table 1 and two catchments in the fukushima area as can be observed in fig 4 the nd 137cs values for three cross sections chernobyl pripyat mozyr pripyat and rechitsa dnieper are similar and their change over time is well described by the semi empirical diffusional model in eq 9 when deff 137cs 0 5 cm2 year bulgakov et al 1991b ivanov et al 1997 konoplev et al 2016b and kd 137cs 34 000 l kg konoplev et al 2020 as is the case with the particulate wash off the values of nd 137cs are lower for the nedanchichi dnieper cross section in addition to the circumstances regarding np values the higher values of deff 137cs and the distance of the nedanchichi from the contamination site there is another rationale for the lower values of nd 137cs at nedanchichi compared with the three other cross sections the mean multi annual value of kd 137cs at nedanchichi dnieper is about twice as high as that at chernobyl pripyat konoplev et al 2020 which alone results in a two times lower nd 137cs value for nedanchichi dnieper compared with the pripyat river and other catchments in the chernobyl contaminated area as can be seen from fig 4 twenty years after the chernobyl accident the nd 137cs values for the pripyat river at mozyr started to decrease faster than predicted by the diffusional model in our opinion this can be explained by changes in land use on the catchment and specifically extensive road construction and planting forest on abandoned farmlands supposedly such changes could lead to an effective increase of deff and as a result a reduction in nd 137cs at this point this is just our speculation and it would be necessary to investigate this problem further for the catchments of the rivers ukedo and ohta in the fukushima area the nd 137cs values are an order of magnitude lower than those for the chernobyl catchments which confirms previous findings konoplev 2016 konoplev et al 2016a for the first years after the fdnpp accident this difference is mainly explained by the values of kd 137cs at least an order of magnitude higher for most of the rivers in the fukushima area konoplev 2015 fig 2 the changes in nd 137cs values over time for both catchments of the ukedo and ohta rivers are described by the proposed diffusional model for dissolved 137cs wash off using a catchment area average of deff 137cs 5 cm2 year konoplev et al 2016b and mean kd 137cs 2 5 105 l kg konoplev 2015 nakanishi and sakuma 2019 taniguchi et al 2019 in general our semiempirical model describes reasonably well the mid and long term dynamics of the particulate and dissolved 137cs wash off both in chernobyl and fukushima rivers comparison of results of recent studies of radionuclide wash off from runoff plots in the chernobyl exclusion zone igarashi et al 2020 with data of similar research at the early phase after the accident borzilov et al 1988 bulgakov et al 1991a konoplev et al 1992 garcia sanchez et al 2005 has also confirmed the relevance of the presented approach until now the processes of radionuclide vertical migration in soil and wash off were considered separately irrespective of each other the proposed model couples the processes of radionuclide vertical migration in catchment soil with wash off based on the assumption that suspended sediments in surface runoff and consequently in river flow originate from the topsoil layer of the catchment thus the model is based on the integrated approach drawing on analysis of key physical chemical processes rather than using empirical approximations 5 conclusions wash off is the principle long term process responsible for radiocesium secondary contamination of surface waters on accidentally contaminated areas for its characterization the particulate and dissolved wash off ratios are used both of them were found to decrease in the mid and long term as a result of radiocesium depletion in the topsoil layer due to its vertical migration in catchment soils the processes of wash off river transport and radionuclide vertical migration in catchment soils were considered in an integrated way by the proposed semi empirical diffusional model this is a novel approach enabling description of changes in the particulate and dissolved 137cs wash off ratios using only two physically meaningful parameters deff the 137cs effective dispersion coefficient in the topsoil layer and kd the 137cs apparent distribution coefficient the mid to long term monitoring data for both chernobyl and fukushima rivers did not reveal any time trend in the apparent 137cs distribution coefficient kd despite distinct interannual variations comparison of collected data set for chernobyl rivers pripyat and dnieper with available data for fukushima rivers ukedo and ohta confirmed that the apparent kd 137cs value for fukushima rivers is about an order of magnitude higher than for chernobyl rivers particulate 137cs wash off ratios from the catchments of the fukushima area display only minor differences compared to those in the chernobyl area being at the lower limit of the chernobyl values somewhat lower values of np 137cs in the fukushima area are explained by higher values of the effective dispersion coefficient deff 137cs in typical fukushima soils dissolved 137cs wash off ratios for fukushima catchments are at least an order of magnitude lower than those for chernobyl mainly due to an order of magnitude difference in the 137cs distribution coefficients for the fukushima and chernobyl rivers the temporal trends for the 137cs wash off ratios both in chernobyl and fukushima areas were satisfactorily described by the proposed model this model can be used as a tool to predict 137cs wash off after a

17423,we analyzed mid to long term 137cs wash off from the catchments contaminated due to the chernobyl accident in 1986 and the fukushima dai ichi nuclear power plant accident in 2011 a semi empirical diffusional model for radionuclide wash off is proposed to enable estimation of the dissolved and particulate 137cs wash off ratios for the chernobyl and fukushima contaminated catchments the differences in the wash off characteristics for these two regions are explained and their long term trends predicted the model is based on the premise that the catchment topsoil layer is the source of sediments in the rivers and the radionuclide concentration in the topsoil can be described by a simple diffusion equation the particulate 137cs wash off ratios for the fukushima contaminated catchments appear to be comparable or slightly lower than those for chernobyl the dissolved 137cs wash off ratios for fukushima catchments are at least an order of magnitude lower than those for chernobyl mainly due to an order of magnitude difference in the 137cs distribution coefficients for the fukushima and chernobyl rivers the proposed semi empirical diffusional model for radionuclide wash off satisfactorily describes the temporal trends in the 137cs wash off characteristics for both the chernobyl and fukushima cases and can be used as a tool for predicting 137cs wash off after a nuclear accident graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords chernobyl fukushima dissolved particulate radiocesium wash off 1 introduction in the event of a major nuclear accident radioactive contamination of water bodies and rivers running through the contaminated areas becomes a concern since these are usually a source of drinking water for the public and used for fishing and irrigation in 1986 as a result of the chernobyl accident extensive areas of the dnieper river basin including the watershed of its right tributary the pripyat river were contaminated with the long lived radionuclides 137cs and 90sr having half lives of about 30 years borzilov et al 1988 konoplev et al 1992 through transport by the river systems radionuclides are distributed beyond the initially contaminated areas and across boundaries iaea 2006 likewise after the fukushima dai ichi nuclear power plant fdnpp accident in 2011 the river basins of the abukuma mano niida ohta ukedo maeda kuma and others evrard et al 2015 konoplev 2016 taniguchi et al 2019 yoshimura et al 2015 flowing into the pacific ocean were exposed to contamination with 137cs transported both in a particulate and dissolved state the principal long term process leading to secondary contamination of natural waters is radionuclide wash off from contaminated land borzilov et al 1988 garcia sanchez 2008 konoplev et al 1996 2016a the issue of wash off from contaminated watersheds is on the priority list starting from studies of environmental behavior of radionuclides originated from nuclear weapon tests and kyshtym accident bobovnikova et al 1977 makhon ko et al 1977 pavlotskaya 1974 pisarev et al 1972 onishi et al 1981 following the chernobyl accident major advances were made in parameterization of radionuclide wash off from contaminated watersheds konoplev et al 1992 after the fukushima accident 137cs wash off characteristics from the contaminated catchments were compared with those for chernobyl for the initial phase konoplev 2016 it was demonstrated that the dissolved 137cs transfer from soil to surface runoff was much lower in fukushima than in chernobyl which was also confirmed by taniguchi et al 2019 in the present study the dynamics of 137cs wash off from contaminated catchments following the two major nuclear accidents is analyzed over a more extended period based on a semi empirical model coupling radionuclide wash off and river transport with its migration in catchment soils util now the processes of vertical migration in catchment soil wash off and river transport were considered separately irrespective of each other herein an integrated approach is implemented based on analysis of key physical chemical processes rather than using empirical approximations the behavior of accidentally released radionuclides in the environment is determined by their properties and environmental characteristics which are key for their mobility and bioavailability konoplev 2020 the climate and geographical conditions for fukushima prefecture of japan and the chernobyl contaminated areas of ukraine belarus and russia display substantial differences the catchments of the chernobyl zone are flat and characterized by minor slopes whereas fukushima s catchments are mainly hilly and have relatively steep slopes annual precipitation also differs markedly and is more than 2 times higher in the fdnpp area 1420 mm laceby et al 2016 than at chernobyl 625 mm konoplev 2016 besides in fukushima region high flow events in rivers occur especially during typhoon s season which facilitate radionuclide wash off from contaminated catchments and its lateral migration evrard et al 2014 konoplev et al 2018 nagao et al 2013 yamashiki et al 2014 the soils of the fukushima and chernobyl contaminated areas differ markedly the chernobyl soils are made of outwash sands and alluvial deposits mainly of loamy sand composition containing a lower proportion of silty fraction as compared to the fukushima region parent rock materials in fukushima are primarily granites and volcanic ashes that are subject to physico chemical weathering in the humid monsoon climate conditions the proportion of clays is 20 30 in fukushima which is higher than in the sandy loam soils of the chernobyl area even though the sand fraction makes 40 50 in both fukushima and chernobyl on the average in addition to geoclimatic differences the speciation of initially deposited 137cs at fukushima and chernobyl differed the principal distinction of the chernobyl fallout was that a considerable fraction of 137cs up to 75 was embedded in water insoluble fuel particles bobovnikova et al 1991 konoplev et al 1992 therefore the 137cs speciation in the fallout was a function of distance from the chernobyl npp since fuel particles were mostly deposited in the vicinity of the reactor and 137cs transported over long distances was incorporated into fine condensation particles konoplev and bulgakov 1999 137cs was leached from fuel particles over time due to their decomposition and oxidation konoplev and bulgakov 1999 konoplev 2020 after the fdnpp accident 137cs was first believed to have deposited in a mobile state as water soluble sulfates kaneyasu et al 2012 later however data became available indicating that a fraction of 137cs up to 40 and even more deposited as glassy water insoluble cs rich microparticles csmp ikehara et al 2020 environmental leaching from these particles is much slower than that from the chernobyl derived fuel particles okumura et al 2019 in fukushima compared to chernobyl particulate 137cs flux is predominant konoplev et al 2016a nagao et al 2013 ochiai et al 2015 ueda et al 2013 in our view this is associated with two factors first 137cs in fukushima is stronger bound to soil particles and sediments in contrast to chernobyl which is enhanced by the presence of water insoluble csmp konoplev 2015 nakanishi and sakuma 2019 taniguchi et al 2019 yoshimura et al 2015 second the greater annual precipitation with extreme floods during typhoons and much higher average inclinations of typical catchments in fukushima compared to chernobyl lead to more significant erosion of the topsoil layer and wash off of particulate 137cs strongly bound to topsoil particles evrard et al 2014 konoplev 2016 laceby et al 2016 nagao et al 2013 another hypothesis was also discussed in the literature naulier et al 2017 suggested that particulate organic matter could have contributed significantly to the increased particulate concentrations of radiocesium in river sediments this hypothesis however is different from the prevalent and generally accepted view in post chernobyl radioecology regarding the role of organic matter in radiocesium dynamics valcke and cremers 1994 some of post fukushima studies have not confirmed this either iwagami et al 2017 and hence this hypothesis requires further investigation thus the difference in the initial speciation of 137cs in chernobyl and fukushima as well as the difference in the composition of the soils that govern radionuclide selective sorption and fixation along with the difference in geoclimatic conditions are responsible for the differences in characteristics of 137cs wash off from the contaminated catchments 2 theoretical background 2 1 quantitative characteristics of radionuclide wash off and their parameterization the most important quantitative characteristic of radionuclide wash off used for predicting secondary contamination of water bodies is the wash off coefficient representing the fraction of radionuclide inventory in the catchment transported by surface runoff to water bodies bobovnikova et al 1977 borzilov et al 1988 makhon ko et al 1977 pisarev et al 1972 in surface runoff radionuclides can occur in dissolved and particulate forms since the physicochemical state of the radionuclide to a great extent determines its further behavior in surface waters dissolved and particulate wash off should be considered separately the particulate wash off coefficient wp and dissolved wash off coefficient wd represent the fractions of radionuclide washed off from the catchment as suspended particles and in solution respectively they are determined for the period of interest or a single runoff event and are defined as follows borzilov et al 1988 garcia sanchez and konoplev 2009 konoplev 2016 1 w p 0 t c p t m t d t s σ s d s c p m σ s w d 0 t c d t q t d t s σ s d s c d v σ s where cp t and c p are the instantaneous and weighted average radionuclide activity concentrations on suspended particles bq g respectively m t and м are the erosion rate g s and the sediment yield g for the period of interest or the single runoff event cd t and c d are the instantaneous and weighted average radionuclide concentrations in solution bq l q t is the runoff rate l s v is the total runoff volume l σ s is the local radionuclide deposition for the watershed section ds bq m2 σ is the radionuclide mean deposition over the entire catchment area bq m2 s is the catchment area m2 0 and t are the starting time and duration of the runoff event or the period of interest s respectively and t is time s for practical application the wash off coefficients have been normalized through the runoff characteristics essential for radionuclide wash off for dissolved wash off this is the runoff volume divided by the area of catchment i e runoff layer while the particulate wash off coefficient is proportional to the sediment yield from the catchment area borzilov et al 1988 konoplev et al 1992 dividing wd by the runoff layer and wp by the mass of eroded material from the area unit we get the normalized dissolved and particulate wash off coefficients which according to eq 1 are equal to the ratio of the corresponding mean activity concentration and the average deposition of the radionuclide on the catchment 2 n d w d h w d s v c d σ n p w p q w p s m с p σ where is h is the runoff depth m q is the mass of eroded material from the catchment area g m2 nd is the normalized dissolved wash off coefficient m 1 for the period of interest and np is the normalized particulate wash off coefficient m2 g for the period of interest we will refer to these parameters as nd dissolved wash off ratio and np particulate wash off ratio the proportionality of the dissolved wash off coefficient wd and runoff depth was noted in early studies of radionuclide wash off resulting from the global nuclear weapon tests fallout rovinsky et al 1976 1979 to study the time dependence of wash off characteristics the use of instantaneous wash off ratios is convenient bulgakov et al 1991a 3 n d c d t σ n p c p t σ a major advantage of the wash off ratios is that they can be used to predict the radionuclide wash off from contaminated catchments and their concentrations in rivers and other water bodies borzilov et al 1989 1993 to estimate the fraction of the radionuclide washed off in solution the dissolved wash off ratio is multiplied by the expected runoff depth for a given runoff event or period of interest the fraction of radionuclide washed off with sediments is estimated by multiplying the particulate wash off ratio by the predicted sediment yield during the runoff event or period of interest borzilov et al 1988 konoplev et al 1992 this is how the contamination of surface waters due to snowmelt or rainfall floods after the chernobyl accident was predicted in the early phase borzilov et al 1989 1993 2 2 semi empirical modeling of long term dynamics of radionuclide wash off from contaminated catchments the main source of suspended particles for surface runoff is the top layer of catchment soil multiple studies of wash off of contaminants of different nature have shown that the depth of the soil layer from which the contaminant is effectively transferred to the surface runoff is several millimeters up to 1 cm ahuja et al 1981 borzilov et al 1989 bulgakov et al 1991a 2000 donigian et al 1977 knisel 1980 the radionuclide concentration in topsoil decreases over time due to its vertical migration to deeper soil layers the analysis of the vertical distribution of radionuclides such as 137cs and 241am strongly bound to soil particles has indicated that as late as 30 years after the chernobyl accident the highest concentrations of these radionuclides occurred in the top layer of undisturbed meadow and forest soils konoplev et al 2020 therefore the vertical migration of 137cs in soil after a one time fallout from the atmosphere as is the case with a nuclear accident with certain simplifications can be approximated by a quasi diffusional model bulgakov et al 1991b 2000 ivanov et al 1997 konoplev et al 2020 4 c s t σ 0 ρ π d e f f t e x 2 4 d e f f λ t where σ 0 is the initial average deposition of radionuclide on the catchment deff is the effective dispersion coefficient λ is the radioactive decay rate constant ρ is the average bulk density of the topsoil over the catchment x is the depth from the soil surface and t is time in this case the time dependence of radionuclide concentration in the topsoil layer at x 0 and hence on suspended particles entrained by the surface runoff is approximated by the equation konoplev et al 2020 5 c p t σ ρ π d eff t e λ t here it is assumed that radionuclide deposition and land use types are uniform across the catchment area the dissolved radionuclide concentration in the surface runoff or river is related to the particulate radionuclide concentration through the distribution coefficient k d which by definition is the ratio of these concentrations at equilibrium iaea 2010 konoplev 2015 6 k d t c p t c d t more than 30 years of 137cs monitoring in the major rivers pripyat and dnieper of the chernobyl zone has shown that after the early phase 1 2 years the k d 137cs value displayed some variation but no statistically significant trend was observed konoplev et al 2020 then with allowance for eqs 5 and 6 the time dependence of dissolved 137cs concentration in a river can be approximated by the equation konoplev et al 2020 7 c d t σ ρ k d π d e f f t e λ t substituting eqs 5 and 7 into eq 3 and assuming the 137cs deposition in the catchment decreases with time only due to radioactive decay i e ignoring the minor losses due to wash off soil plant transfer and wind resuspension with subsequent atmospheric transport we get 8 n p t 1 ρ π d e f f t n p 0 t n p 0 ρ π d e f f 1 9 n d t 1 ρ k d π d e f f t n d 0 t n d 0 ρ k d π d e f f 1 eqs 8 and 9 estimate the wash off ratios after the early phase of a nuclear accident and predict the mid and long term dynamics of radionuclide wash off it should be emphasized that the equations are not applicable for the first days weeks and months after the accident because at t 0 eqs 8 and 9 are meaningless the merit of the proposed semi empirical diffusional approach is that it enables prediction of the radionuclide wash off and secondary contamination of surface waters for the mid and long term phases after a nuclear accident using only two key physicochemical parameters of radionuclide dispersion and distribution in the sediment water system the main parameter determining particulate radionuclide wash off is the effective dispersion coefficient deff for catchment topsoil which depends on radionuclide chemical properties sorption and fixation ability of catchment soil and climatic conditions e g mean annual rainfall mean annual air temperature etc another critical parameter controlling dissolved radionuclide wash off besides deff is the distribution coefficient kd in the sediment water system these parameters can be estimated from literature data regarding vertical migration of radionuclides in soil and their distribution in the sediment water system bulgakov et al 1991b 2000 ivanov et al 1997 konoplev 2015 konoplev et al 2016b the values n p 0 and n d 0 can also be derived from monitoring data of the first few years after the accident and then used for mid and long term predictions an alternative approach to modeling the dynamics of radionuclide wash off is application of an empirical multi exponential transfer function his empirical model was developed and widely used in post chernobyl studies garcia sanchez 2008 hilton et al 1997 monte et al 2004 smith et al 2005 such an approach was followed by a number of researchers in post fukushima investigations of radiocesium dynamics in rivers funaki et al 2020 iwagami et al 2017 nakanishi and sakuma 2019 taniguchi et al 2019 in our view the semi empirical diffusional model proposed in this work has important advantages as compared to the empirical multi exponential model first the diffusional model has only two parameters deff and kd which have a clear physical meaning second it integrates the processes of radionuclide migration in catchment soils with the processes of its wash off and river transport notably the proposed here diffusional model is valid for long lived radionuclides strongly bound to soil particles such as 137cs but cannot be applied to short lived radioisotopes and radionuclides passing into solution easily as the conditions are not met in such cases also the basic assumption of the model that the main source of sediments in surface runoff is the topsoil layer can be invalid in some cases for fukushima for instance huon et al 2018 claimed that up to 25 of deposited sediments in the mano dam reservoir in fukushima come from subsoil however the sources of sediments for surface runoff and dam deposits can be different and the above proportion can be overestimation for surface runoff we do realize that our assumption is to some extent a limitation of the model and may not always be fulfilled in specific circumstances of fukushima especially in case of extreme floods etc and hence some model predictions can deviate from observations such deviations however are not expected to be significant for averaged characteristics one of the purposes of this work was to evaluate the relevance of this simplification another constraint is associated with potential impact of remediation the model is based on the assumption that radionuclide concentration in the topsoil layer changes due to natural environmental processes in case of remediation the natural environment is disturbed and strictly speaking application of the model becomes problematic if the scale and efficacy of remediation for a specific catchment is known its impact can be allowed for through certain corrections 3 study sites to test the proposed semi empirical diffusional model of radionuclide wash off the 137cs monitoring data for the contaminated river systems after the chernobyl and fukushima accidents were used for the chernobyl zone data were collected for the rivers pripyat and dnieper in the case of the pripyat river the cross sections under study were mozyr belarus and chernobyl ukraine for the dnieper river the cross sections rechitsa belarus and nedanchichi ukraine were studied fig 1 although the areas contaminated after the chernobyl accident are more extensive than those in fukushima they still occupy a minor part of dnieper and pripyat catchments and thus average 137cs deposition is rather low as compared to the smaller fukushima catchments table 1 for all the chernobyl zone cross sections investigated data for 1987 2001 from the database db runoff were used the db runoff was developed as part of program 2 radioecology of the french german initiative for chernobyl which was led by institute for radiological protection and nuclear safety irsn france and institute for plant and reactor safety grs fgi 2006 the database contains detailed information on radionuclide transfer by surface runoff for heavily contaminated catchments in belarus russia and ukraine general characteristics of the contaminated watersheds such as meteorology hydrology soils radionuclide deposition and radionuclide concentrations in 5 large rivers including the dnieper and pripyat and 17 smaller rivers together with their hydrochemical characteristics are available in the database detailed description of the database can be found in konoplev et al 2002a the db runoff is owned by irsn and grs and can be requested from them for 2002 2017 the monitoring data by ukrainian state specialized enterprise ecocenter and ukrainian hydrometeorological institute uhmi were used for the chernobyl cross section for the nedanchichi cross section data for 2002 2017 were obtained from the uhmi and central geophysical observatory kiev ukraine for the monitoring period 2002 2017 data of belarus hydrometeorological service for the cross sections mozyr pripyat and rechitsa dnieper were taken from regular annual reports for 2003 2017 such as shershakov et al 2018 and earlier issues available at http www rpatyphoon ru products pollution media php data for 137cs activity concentrations in the rivers at studied cross sections have been published recently konoplev et al 2020 voitsekhovych et al 2016 based on the monitoring data the mean annual 137cs concentrations in the rivers were determined notably after the chernobyl accident the primary focus of the monitoring system was on dissolved radionuclides as they were mainly transported in solution konoplev 2016 whereas reliable data about the particulate 137cs were not available for many rivers and cross sections furthermore the particulate 137cs concentrations were sometimes measured in bq l which precluded credible estimation of the particulate wash off characteristics trustworthy data from long term monitoring of particulate 137cs is only available for two cross sections chernobyl pripyat and nedanchichi dnieper the situation in the fdnpp zone differed markedly the contribution of particulate 137cs was higher than that of dissolved 137cs and data on particulate 137cs activity concentrations in rivers and on topsoil erosion started to be collected shortly after the accident evrard et al 2015 yoshimura et al 2015 for comparative analysis we calculated the characteristics of 137cs wash off from the ukedo river and ohta river catchments two of the most contaminated rivers in the fdnpp zone based on the dissolved and particulate 137cs monitoring data nakanishi and sakuma 2019 which were added by data from taniguchi et al 2019 yoshimura et al 2015 about 60 of these rivers catchments are occupied by forests 33 40 are occupied by grass and bare fields including abandoned farmlands and paddy fields taniguchi et al 2019 table 1 these catchments can be categorized as highly contaminated the mean 137cs depositions of these catchments 3 mbq m2 for ukedo river and 1 7 mbq m2 for ohta river nakanishi and sakuma 2019 are higher than those of the rivers pripyat and dnieper and only the sakhan river the right bank tributary of the pripyat river in the chernobyl exclusion zone has similar 137cs deposition on its catchment konoplev 2016 4 results and discussion long term monitoring of the chernobyl rivers has not revealed any time trend in the apparent kd 137cs despite distinct variations konoplev et al 2020 until now this can be also stated concerning fukushima rivers nakanishi and sakuma 2019 taniguchi et al 2019 this is illustrated by fig 2 which compares time dependences of the apparent kd 137cs in the pripyat river at chernobyl for 1990 2016 konoplev et al 2020 and in the ukedo river fukushima for 2012 2018 based on the data from nakanishi and sakuma 2019 yoshimura et al 2015 therefore a single value of the apparent kd 137cs can be taken for the whole period of observations for the pripyat river and ukedo river respectively fig 2 confirms the earlier finding that the apparent kd for fukushima rivers is about an order of magnitude higher than for chernobyl rivers konoplev 2015 and is comparable with the apparent kd value for chernobyl derived 137cs in the lake constance having distinct conditions konoplev et al 2002b fig 3 shows the mean annual values of particulate 137cs wash off ratios np for the catchments of the pripyat river at chernobyl and the dnieper river at nedanchichi in the chernobyl contaminated area based on monitoring data after 1986 konoplev et al 2020 and the rivers ukedo and ohta in the fukushima contaminated area based on data after 2011 nakanishi and sakuma 2019 the values of np 137cs were calculated using eq 2 with decay correction for the mean deposition on the catchment assuming that the temporal change in 137cs inventory was only due to radioactive decay and disregarding the contribution of wash off and wind resuspension fig 3 also shows results of estimations using the proposed semi empirical model of particulate 137cs wash off for two values of deff 0 5 cm2 year solid line and 5 cm2 year dashed line the effective dispersion coefficient for the chernobyl soils deff 137cs can be taken to be 0 5 cm2 year bulgakov et al 1991b ivanov et al 1997 konoplev et al 2016b whereas the fukushima soils are characterized by higher deff values in the range of 1 10 cm2 year konoplev et al 2016a 2016b the high variability of deff in soils leads to uncertainty in the assessment and prediction of 137cs wash off from specific catchments however this uncertainty can be reduced by conducting a large scale survey of radionuclide vertical distribution within a catchment as a function of soil type and land use obviously such a study would require huge efforts and material resources which is hardly feasible there can be several reasons for the marked difference in the particulate 137cs wash off ratios for the rivers pripyat and dnieper as shown in fig 3 the most important in our opinion is the non uniformity in the radionuclide deposition over the catchment area and hence the location of the most contaminated parts of the catchment with respect to the observational cross section as shown in fig 1 the contamination levels at the chernobyl cross section located where the pripyat river exits the chernobyl exclusion zone exceed 3000 kbq m2 the sediments freshly washed off from this most contaminated section of the catchment including highly contaminated sub catchments of smaller tributaries of the pripyat river konoplev 2016 are directly transported to the chernobyl cross section in contrast 137cs deposition in the dnieper river catchment the so called bryansk belarus cesium spot mostly occurs upstream of the dnieper river more than 100 km from the observed nedanchichi cross section the contaminated sediments of the bryansk belarus spot are transported by the river sozh and its tributaries flowing through the contaminated areas after the sozh river joins the dnieper river and down to the nedanchichi cross section the catchment section is less contaminated and the contaminated sediments from upstream are retained in the accumulation zones moreover relatively clean sediments from the uncontaminated sections enter the dnieper river here diluting and reducing particulate 137cs activity concentrations this seems to explain the lower values of the particulate 137cs wash off ratios at the nedanchichi cross section on the dnieper river compared to the chernobyl cross section on the pripyat river another possible reason for the difference in the particulate wash off characteristics for the chernobyl and nedanchichi cross sections is the difference in the mean deff values for the corresponding catchments as follows from eq 8 the value of the particulate 137cs wash off ratio is reversely proportional to d e f f for arable lands the apparent deff values are more than those for meadows forests and abandoned lands the territories adjacent to the chernobyl cross section were withdrawn from agricultural use in 1986 and the soils there have a lower deff and expected higher values of the particulate wash off ratio as shown in fig 3 the change in np over time for the pripyat river the chernobyl cross section is well described by the model at the values of deff 0 5 cm2 year whereas for the dnieper river nedanchichi the time dependence of np is described by the proposed diffusional model at deff values of 2 3 times higher the comparison with the ukedo and ohta rivers in the fdnpp zone shows that the np values for these rivers are 2 3 times lower than those for the pripyat river chernobyl and similar to those for the dnieper river nedanchichi this is consistent with the higher deff 137cs values in the fukushima soils compared to the typical deff 137cs values for the chernobyl soils which is associated with higher annual precipitation higher mean annual air temperature and higher biological activity in the fukushima soils konoplev et al 2016a 2016b the np 137cs value and its time dependence for the ukedo and ohta rivers in the fdnpp zone is in agreement with the calculations using the proposed semi empirical model at deff 137cs of about 5 cm2 year fig 4 shows the time dependence of the mean annual dissolved 137cs wash off ratios for four catchments in the chernobyl area see table 1 and two catchments in the fukushima area as can be observed in fig 4 the nd 137cs values for three cross sections chernobyl pripyat mozyr pripyat and rechitsa dnieper are similar and their change over time is well described by the semi empirical diffusional model in eq 9 when deff 137cs 0 5 cm2 year bulgakov et al 1991b ivanov et al 1997 konoplev et al 2016b and kd 137cs 34 000 l kg konoplev et al 2020 as is the case with the particulate wash off the values of nd 137cs are lower for the nedanchichi dnieper cross section in addition to the circumstances regarding np values the higher values of deff 137cs and the distance of the nedanchichi from the contamination site there is another rationale for the lower values of nd 137cs at nedanchichi compared with the three other cross sections the mean multi annual value of kd 137cs at nedanchichi dnieper is about twice as high as that at chernobyl pripyat konoplev et al 2020 which alone results in a two times lower nd 137cs value for nedanchichi dnieper compared with the pripyat river and other catchments in the chernobyl contaminated area as can be seen from fig 4 twenty years after the chernobyl accident the nd 137cs values for the pripyat river at mozyr started to decrease faster than predicted by the diffusional model in our opinion this can be explained by changes in land use on the catchment and specifically extensive road construction and planting forest on abandoned farmlands supposedly such changes could lead to an effective increase of deff and as a result a reduction in nd 137cs at this point this is just our speculation and it would be necessary to investigate this problem further for the catchments of the rivers ukedo and ohta in the fukushima area the nd 137cs values are an order of magnitude lower than those for the chernobyl catchments which confirms previous findings konoplev 2016 konoplev et al 2016a for the first years after the fdnpp accident this difference is mainly explained by the values of kd 137cs at least an order of magnitude higher for most of the rivers in the fukushima area konoplev 2015 fig 2 the changes in nd 137cs values over time for both catchments of the ukedo and ohta rivers are described by the proposed diffusional model for dissolved 137cs wash off using a catchment area average of deff 137cs 5 cm2 year konoplev et al 2016b and mean kd 137cs 2 5 105 l kg konoplev 2015 nakanishi and sakuma 2019 taniguchi et al 2019 in general our semiempirical model describes reasonably well the mid and long term dynamics of the particulate and dissolved 137cs wash off both in chernobyl and fukushima rivers comparison of results of recent studies of radionuclide wash off from runoff plots in the chernobyl exclusion zone igarashi et al 2020 with data of similar research at the early phase after the accident borzilov et al 1988 bulgakov et al 1991a konoplev et al 1992 garcia sanchez et al 2005 has also confirmed the relevance of the presented approach until now the processes of radionuclide vertical migration in soil and wash off were considered separately irrespective of each other the proposed model couples the processes of radionuclide vertical migration in catchment soil with wash off based on the assumption that suspended sediments in surface runoff and consequently in river flow originate from the topsoil layer of the catchment thus the model is based on the integrated approach drawing on analysis of key physical chemical processes rather than using empirical approximations 5 conclusions wash off is the principle long term process responsible for radiocesium secondary contamination of surface waters on accidentally contaminated areas for its characterization the particulate and dissolved wash off ratios are used both of them were found to decrease in the mid and long term as a result of radiocesium depletion in the topsoil layer due to its vertical migration in catchment soils the processes of wash off river transport and radionuclide vertical migration in catchment soils were considered in an integrated way by the proposed semi empirical diffusional model this is a novel approach enabling description of changes in the particulate and dissolved 137cs wash off ratios using only two physically meaningful parameters deff the 137cs effective dispersion coefficient in the topsoil layer and kd the 137cs apparent distribution coefficient the mid to long term monitoring data for both chernobyl and fukushima rivers did not reveal any time trend in the apparent 137cs distribution coefficient kd despite distinct interannual variations comparison of collected data set for chernobyl rivers pripyat and dnieper with available data for fukushima rivers ukedo and ohta confirmed that the apparent kd 137cs value for fukushima rivers is about an order of magnitude higher than for chernobyl rivers particulate 137cs wash off ratios from the catchments of the fukushima area display only minor differences compared to those in the chernobyl area being at the lower limit of the chernobyl values somewhat lower values of np 137cs in the fukushima area are explained by higher values of the effective dispersion coefficient deff 137cs in typical fukushima soils dissolved 137cs wash off ratios for fukushima catchments are at least an order of magnitude lower than those for chernobyl mainly due to an order of magnitude difference in the 137cs distribution coefficients for the fukushima and chernobyl rivers the temporal trends for the 137cs wash off ratios both in chernobyl and fukushima areas were satisfactorily described by the proposed model this model can be used as a tool to predict 137cs wash off after a

17424,natural swimming ponds nsps are artificially created bodies of water intended for human recreation characterised by the substitution of chemical disinfection with natural biological processes for water purification nsps are growing in popularity however little is known regarding the public health risks a screening level risk assessment was undertaken as an initial step in assessing the first canadian public nsp located in edmonton alberta risk of enteric pathogens originating from pool bathers was assessed under normal conditions and following accidental faecal release events the performance of the natural treatment train for health protection was quantified with and without the addition of uv disinfection of naturally treated water and compared to the us epa benchmark to provide a reference point to consider acceptability estimated levels of pathogen contamination of the pond were dependant upon the discrete number of shedders present which in turn depended upon the prevalence of infection in the population overall performance of the natural disinfection system was dependant upon the filtration rate of the natural treatment system or turnover time addition of uv disinfection reduced the uncertainty around the removal efficacy and mitigated the impact of larger shedding events however the impact of uv disinfection on the natural treatment biome is unknown further information is needed on the performance of natural barriers for pathogen removal and therefore challenge studies are recommended given the identified risks the pool is posted that there is risk from accidental faecal releases as in any natural water body with swimmers screening level risk assessment was a valuable first step in understanding the processes driving the system and in identifying important data gaps graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords qmra recreational water quality cryptosporidium norovirus campylobacter natural swimming ponds 1 introduction natural swimming ponds nsps are artificially created bodies of water intended for human recreation characterised by the substitution of chemical disinfection with natural biological processes for water purification the first nsp in recent times was built in austria in the early 1980s and by 2010 more than 20 000 nsps had been constructed of which a hundred were open to the public littlewood 2005 cited in casanovas massana and blanch 2013 despite the growing popularity of these natural systems little is known regarding the adequacy of the natural processes for enteric pathogen removal to provide adequate water quality for swimmers also it is well known by health authorities that most recreational disease is not identified in normal health surveillance programs fewtrell and kay 2015 hence the majority go unreported even though there may be significant impacts on society including lost work days dwight et al 2005 in general the chlorine resistant parasitic protozoan cryptosporidium hominis is the leading cause of gastroenteritis in swimming pools and results from faecal accidents releases suppes et al 2016 referred to in this paper as bather shedding human faeces may contain pathogens and is a known pathway of infection in recreational water environments chalmers 2012 dale et al 2010 graciaa et al 2018 pond 2005 hence in a natural pool without chemical disinfectant residual expected bather shedding of pathogens will go untreated until the pool water is passed through sufficient natural barriers with human enteric viruses the most numerous and infectious of these enteric pathogens ashbolt 2015 while the social and health benefits associated with recreational water environments are well recognized various outbreaks have been associated with microbiological contamination of recreational waters in natural ponds and lakes blostein 1991 paunio et al 1999 sinclair et al 2009 and inadequately disinfected swimming pools barna and kádár 2012 sinclair et al 2009 hence the efficacy and reliability of disinfection treatments natural or artificial is central to maintaining the microbial safety of recreational waters the design and operation of the first canadian nsp in edmonton was the focus of this microbial risk assessment the nsp treatment system designed by polyplan kreikenbaum group gmbh www polyplan umwelt de was part of a municipal pool upgrade as part of the planning process potential faecal pathogen risks were evaluated using a quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra framework it is recommended to undertake qmra at increasing levels of detail referred to as a tiered approach who 2016 beginning simply and only increasing complexity as needed this paper documents the first screening level risk assessment of pathogen risk undertaken of a nsp the objective of the screening level assessment was to characterize the system in a very simplistic way based on average flow rates within a simple box flow model and using available literature data assess factors driving illness risks from accidental ingestion of enteric viruses bacteria and parasitic protozoa and to identify future data collection needs for the purpose of quantify risks adequately to support health protection 2 materials and methods the nsp is part of a redevelopment of a public pool at borden park edmonton canada https www edmonton ca activities parks recreation borden park outdoor pool aspx the design consists of a large rectangular main pool a shallow children s pool referred to as kiddie pool and an area of floor nozzles designed for children s water play the water flow is connected between all pools see fig 1 via the pump well b1 and is directed to external filtration units neptune filter hydrobotanic and submerse filters for purification the public pool is fenced from wildlife and fed by potable water from the mains drinking water supply therefore the significant only source of faecal contamination considered in the assessment was from bathers the first step in any qmra is to undertake a problem formulation defining clearly the purpose and scope of the assessment who 2016 to address each class of microbial pathogen viral bacterial parasitic protozoan for the first tier in the qmra process the following reference pathogens were selected to represent each microbial group norovirus campylobacter jejuni and cryptosporidium hominis with norovirus and c jejuni representing some of the most prevalent pathogenic enteric viruses and bacteria reported in edmonton sewage banting et al 2016 qiu et al 2015 and known to infect recreational swimmers guy et al 2018 c hominis was selected as oocysts are known to be far more resistant to environmental decay processes than giardia cysts hamilton et al 2018 risk to adults and children were considered separately and compared with the gastrointestinal benchmark of the u s epa for freshwaters of 35 cases of gastroenteritis per 1000 swimming events epa 2012 exposure scenarios included in the risk assessment were for unintentional shedding during normal operation nominal load 252 adults and 17 children high bather load estimated as 1 5 times the nominal value 378 adults and 26 children and larger faecal release events first the magnitude of pathogen contamination due to unintentional bather shedding was estimated and the level of treatment required in order to achieve the benchmark risk was quantified the capacity of the designed filtration system for treating the pathogen load at the benchmark risk level was then assessed including the system response to larger pathogen release incidents the overall objective of the assessment was to assess the adequacy of the proposed treatment system for managing pathogen risks to bathers and to identify future research needs to better characterize safety 2 1 magnitude of pathogen contamination due to unintentional bather shedding enteric pathogens are transmitted by the faecal oral route and therefore the presence of pathogens in the water column is caused by shedding of faecal material by swimmers in this model the pathogen loading under typical operating conditions was estimated as n fs crp where n is the discrete number of people visiting the facility per day infected with a reference pathogen fs is the amount of faecal material grams shed per person per day and crp is the concentration of reference pathogens in the faeces of infected individuals organisms g 1 number of people shedding only infected people excrete pathogens the point prevalence of each of the reference pathogens was estimated in order to model the expected number of excreters present at the pool by day the point prevalence was estimated from the reported number of cases by week for the province of alberta canada for each pathogen using the formula p o i n t p r e v a l e n c e r u d 7 n 1 a where r is the reported number of cases per week u is the underreporting factor d is the duration of excretion days n is the population of alberta 4200 000 and a is the asymptomatic infection rate a summary of inputs is included in table 1 while campylobacterosis is a reportable illness in alberta cryptosporidiosis and norovirus infections are not and therefore data regarding the identified number of cases is not available for analysis the selection of a conservative on the high end of the realistic range weekly rate of reporting was made via discussions with alberta health services the number of visitors shedding shedders reference pathogens on any given day will be a discrete number given the number of visitors n and the point prevalence pp of shedding in the general population the discrete number of shedders on any given day was modelled using a binomial distribution with parameters n and pp a sample of the number of shedders was generated using monte carlo simulation 10 000 iterations faecal shedding unintentional shedding of faecal material by bathers is widely documented elmir et al 2009 elmir et al 2007 gerba 2000 the amount of faeces shed per person is highly uncertain and was estimated relying on measurements from the literature of faecal indicator concentrations in bathing waters details of this analysis is included in supplementary material given the uncertainty in shedding mass a reference distribution to describe the variability in faecal excretion was implemented in the model a reference distribution is recommended to explicitly represent a plausible range when there is a lack of data to fully describe a distribution who 2016 we chose a triangular distribution a distribution often used as a rough modelling tool where the range and most likely value within that range can be estimated vose 2008 for faecal excretion with a mode equal to 0 6 and lower and upper bounds of 0 06 and 6 gs pathogen shedding density reported concentrations of pathogens in the faeces shedding density is variable the shedding density appears to vary between individuals and over the course of an infection bambic et al 2011 reviewed the published data and reported the following relevant to our chosen reference pathogens a median campylobacter concentration of 107 cfu g 1 ranging 101 108 for norovirus the median was 108 copies g 1 and a range of 104 1010 and for cryptosporidium the median was 105 oocysts g 1 ranging 103 106 the range limits and medians were used to define triangular distributions for the shedding density of each reference pathogen using a model constructed in mathematica wolfram international version 11 1 a monte caro simulation 10 000 random samples was undertaken to obtain a random sample of the concentration of each reference pathogen in the main pool and the kiddie pool assuming complete mixing the sensitivity of the estimated concentration to each of the model input variables number of shedders pathogen density in faeces and magnitude of faecal shedding by bathers was evaluating using the spearman rank correlation coefficient to compare each of the input random samples with the generated concentration sample 2 2 assessment of treatment requirements qmra quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra was used to assess the amount of treatment required in order to achieve the u s epa benchmark risk using the approach illustrated in fig 2 and the sample of pathogen concentrations from unintentional bather shedding the required log10 reduction was estimated a random sample representing the variability in the treatment requirements was generated using the pathogen concentration samples described in the previous section a summary of the model input assumptions is included in table 2 2 3 pathogen reduction capacity of designed natural treatment system a simple box model was applied assuming complete mixing within each component of the model over each time step to evaluate the overall pathogen reduction capacity of the treatment system given the flow paths represented in fig 1 and the standard and maximum flow rates included in table 3 together with the assumed log10 removal capacity of each of the barriers the change in pathogen concentration over time was estimated five removal barriers were considered in the scoping of the qmra a wetland system consisting of zooplankton filtering a hydro botanic filter and submerse sand root filter a commercial designed neptune surface spray gravel media filter and uv disinfection fig 1 however there is very limited published data on the performance of these nsp barriers bruns and pepper 2019 so in combination with related literature estimates we provided reasonable point estimate and plausible ranges in log10 removals for each barrier to be applied within the screening level qmra model table 4 as such triangular distributions defined by mode min and max were selected to describe the variability and uncertainty associated with the log10 removals zooplankton filtering zooplankton grazing is proposed to provide important in situ disinfection in nsps bruns and peppler 2019 yet requires careful consideration as to how well it may be expected to perform as a barrier for protection of human health studies have shown that free living environmental protozoa can ingest human enteric bacteria and protozoan pathogens including cryptosporidium oocysts agasild and nõges 2005 connelly et al 2007 stott et al 2003 trout et al 2002 yet very little is known regarding the rate that zooplankton can clear oo cysts from the surrounding water however rates of 22 24 ml grazer 1 day 1 and 15 19 ml grazer 1 day 1 for cryptosporidium oocysts and giardia cysts respectively have been reported connelly et al 2007 the filtration capacity of zooplankton reported by eydeler and spieker 2010 cited in bruns and peppler 2019 ranged from 8 5 to 64 8 ml grazer 1 day 1 for rotatoria copepoda and cladocera protozoa the more pressing issue relates to the poorly documented fate of ingested pathogens within zooplankton and their faecal pellets rather than inactivate and digest all ingested pathogens there is growing evidence that pathogens may be concentrated within zooplankton where they may be protected from external environmental stressors ultimately favoring their survival bichai et al 2010 bichai et al 2014 bichai et al 2008 folkins et al 2020 tang et al 2011 so while faecal pellets may accumulate within sediments and on plant surfaces and unknown fraction may stay suspended or be resuspended for these reasons zooplankton filtering was not included as a barrier for pathogen removal within this screening level assessment of the nsp system hydro botanic and submerse filter two parallel filters were proposed in the design of the nsp including 1 hydro botanic filter with a bed thickness of 2 00 m and a design retention time of 6 8 h and 2 submerse filter with a bed thickness of 2 00 m and a design retention time of 4 5 h while these two filters operate in parallel regarding their likely removal efficiency they are considered here together due to the similarity of mechanisms mechanisms of pathogen removal within these filters include adsorption to soil and filter substratum predation noting issues identified for zooplankton filtering above sedimentation physical filtering of larger organisms and inactivation due to environmental exposure ph temperature sunlight only for the hydro botanic filter both filters have been estimated to achieve 10 reduction of e coli bruns and peppler 2019 limited data is available in the literature specifically for hydro botanic and submerse filters however a range of removal performances for microorganisms have been reported for wastewater systems using subsurface wetlands rock filters and reed beds reviewed by verbyla 2015 bacterial reductions are in the range of 1 25 2 5 log10 viruses 0 5 to 2 log10 and parasitic protozoa between 0 4 and 3 log10 adhikari et al 2013 bastos et al 2010 garcia et al 2010 gerba et al 1999 jackson and jackson 2008 karim et al 2004 reinoso et al 2008 stevik et al 2004 vidales contreras et al 2012 vidales et al 2003 vymazal 2005 however noting that a key driver of removal is often the retention time within the filter and retention times in these studies were typically in the order of days rather than hours proposed for the nsp while the design only assumes 10 removal for each of these filters it seems reasonable to assume that at least 1 log10 would be achieved for bacteria and protozoa with a lower value of 0 5 log10 for viruses neptune filter the neptune filter system has a gravel medium depth of 2 00 to 2 20 m and a retention time of 20 min was assumed by designers to have a higher e coli removal efficacy of 90 in comparison to the hydro botanic and submerse filters challenge studies with coliphage assumed to be a reasonable human enteric virus surrogate to mimic their on similar filters has shown between 95 and 99 reduction bruns and peppler 2019 uv disinfection uv disinfection is considered as an option in the design of the treatment system the most extensive meta analysis review of data relating to pathogen sensitivity to uv has is by hijnen et al hijnen et al 2006 inactivation of reference pathogens can be estimated from the models reported in this review for the expected uv doses at the nsp system of 25 mj cm 2 and 40 mj cm 2 for bacteria and protozoa estimated reductions were similar between reference pathogens of the same group i e e coli o157 h7 was similar to campylobacter and cryptosporidium was similar to giardia however for viruses there was a strong difference between adenoviruses compared to other enteric virus types ye et al 2018 while the values for norovirus inactivation are based on the calicivirus surrogate data from hijnen et al 2006 it is noted that if human adenovirus results were used the log10 would be 0 5 rather than 2 6 given a starting level of contamination of 500 campylobacter per l 10 000 norovirus per l and 10 cryptosporidium oocysts per l the flow path model was run to estimate the decrease in concentration over time and the subsequent log10 reduction in the main pool and the kiddie pool at 1 min time steps for 24 h the model was run with and without the proposed uv disinfection units given the importance of system water turnover time through treatment on the overall estimated pathogen reduction estimated log10 reductions were evaluated for turnover periods of 1 2 4 6 and 8 h noting that current design turnover of the main pool was specified at 11 and 7 4 h for standard and maximum flow rates respectively and in the kiddie pool 4 and 2 7 h respectively 2 5 event scenarios in addition to regular contamination the response of the system to a larger scale faecal release event was investigated the flow model was applied to assess the response to an accidental release by an ill swimmer the fate of a large pathogen release faeces or vomitus 1010 campylobacter 1012 norovirus and 108 cryptosporidium oocysts occurring in either the main pool kiddie pool or at the floor nozzles was modelled in all three locations over 24 h 3 results 3 1 normal operation estimated distribution of pathogen contamination the monte carlo sample of the number of shedders visiting the pool per day is illustrated for the main pool and the kiddie pool in figs 3 4 respectively the number of shedders was driven by the estimated point prevalence of each reference pathogen in the population table 1 with the assumption of random variation following the binomial distribution used with the highest point prevalence of norovirus 0 8 resulted in the highest estimated number of shedders reaching up to nine at high visitor loads the lowest point prevalence reference pathogen used cryptosporidium at 0 11 led to a high likelihood of zero shedders the resulting distribution of estimated pathogen concentration in the main pool and kiddie pool together with the required log10 reduction to achieve the benchmark risk level is summarised in table 5 and illustrated in figs 5 and 6 the highest loading and removal requirements were for enteric viruses ranging up to 4 5 log10 the risk from cryptosporidium under baseline shedding conditions was estimated to be extremely low the sensitivity of the estimated pathogen loadings to the model input variables is illustrated with the spearman rank correlation coefficient in fig 7 when prevalence was low the estimated concentration was primarily driven by the number of shedders present in the pool as the prevalence of infection increased for example from cryptosporidium to norovirus and hence the likelihood of one or more shedders increased the modelled concentration was then driven by the pathogen density in faeces 3 2 pathogen removal capacity of the treatment system the estimated decrease in average pathogen concentration over time and subsequent log10 reduction in the main swimming pool is illustrated for norovirus in fig 8 campylobacter and cryptosporidium are illustrated in figures s 2 and s 3 the lower 2 5 and upper 97 5 quantiles of the monte carlo simulation are illustrated with dashed lines around the solid median line in all cases the maximum log10 reduction that could be achieved over a 24 h period in the main pool both with and without the application of uv disinfection was around 1 log10 in each case the achievable log10 reduction was limited by the flow rate through the external filtration treatment system the dashed lines 95 quantile interval of the monte carlo sample represent the influence that the uncertainty in assumed pathogen removal performance by treatment had on the overall estimated reduction in pathogen concentration and hence the achieved log10 reduction this uncertainty was highest for viruses since a low reduction was assumed across treatment barriers and the plausible range included in the stochastic analysis was broad however the addition of uv disinfection eliminated the impact of this uncertainty on estimated pathogen reduction in all cases clearly demonstrating the limiting factor of system return flow rate and pool water dilution for the kiddie pool a higher overall log10 reduction could be achieved within the kiddie pool in comparison to the main pool due to the decrease in turnover time 4 h in comparison to 11 h for the main pool for the system flow rates illustrated in figures s 4 s 5 and s 6 the maximum achievable reduction in concentration with uv disinfection was more than 3 5 log10 for all pathogens with the maximum flow rate over 24 h the relationship between turnover time and achievable log10 reduction for each reference pathogen is illustrated in fig 9 reducing the turnover time increases the achievable log10 reduction nevertheless achieving greater than 3 log10 reduction in concentration over 8 h regardless of treatment barriers would require an hourly turnover time 3 3 event analysis aside from the unintentional faecal wash off assumed by normal bathing accidental faecal releases afr or vomitus releases can and do occur in public swimming pools this situation was modelled as an event that could occur in one of three locations the main pool the kiddie pool or the floor nozzles fig 2 the full results for event analysis are included in the supplementary material highest risks and hence greatest removal performance was required for norovirus followed by campylobacter even under the modelled event scenarios the risks from cryptosporidium were calculated to be low when the release occurred within the kiddie pool or the main pool the recovery of the system was slow within that pool uv disinfection did not improve this recovery period nevertheless uv disinfection reduced or prevented the risks being carried across the entire system for example for norovirus risks following an event in the kiddie pool figure s 8 uv disinfection reduced the peak reduction requirements in the main pool from over 4 log10 to below 2 log10 and the risk at the floor nozzles was reduced from requiring around 5 log10 to just over 2 log10 for campylobacter for a pathogen release in the main pool event 3 the inclusion of uv disinfection totally mitigated the risk in the kiddie pool or at the floor nozzle figure s 13 4 discussion it is well established that the prime source of pathogen risks in artificial swimming pools are the swimmers who unintentionally or accidentally due to illness shed pathogens into the water column hence we estimated the likely level of pathogen contamination of the edmonton natural swimming pool under normal operation and during potential event situations to explore how events and which pathogen groups may drive risk therefore risks were summed on a log scale and the combined risk of illness was driven by the highest risk group enteric viruses the approach applied for normal operation was based on the number of visitors to the pool and relied on assumptions regarding the incidence of infection in alberta and estimates of faecal and pathogen shedding from the literature the estimated concentration was variable and uncertain given the extreme ranges of values reported in the literature for example shedding of noroviruses was estimated to range from 101 to 107 copies g 1 nevertheless some important observations are made firstly given that not all individuals are expected to shed pathogens only those who are infected with low prevalence pathogens so the chance of no shedders present was relatively high for our simulations under nominal visitor loading there was more than 75 chance that no one would be shedding cryptosporidium on any given day these results highlight that the enteric pathogen risks can be transient and variable dependant upon the number of shedders present furthermore our prevalence calculations were likely to be an overestimate given that we assumed that all people would be equally likely to attend the pool regardless of their health status or whether they were recovering from an infection it is unlikely that an individual who was actively ill would desire to attend the nsp yet asymptomatic carriers would in the absence of quantitative estimates on this and recognizing that asymptomatic and extended shedding of pathogens over weeks post illness has been widely reported in the literature it seemed wise to be cautious with the prevalence estimates and include all cases it is important to note that the variability in the number of shedders is a critical driver of the pathogen risk and additional attention may be needed during periods of known higher community infection rates e g during an outbreak this points to the importance of public education programs that encourage those who are or who have been unwell to avoid swimming as signposted at the edmonton nsp a message perhaps made easier given the covid 19 pandemic when shedders were present and engaged in water activities the pathogen concentration and hence treatment requirements to maintain safety of other swimmers was estimated risk from cryptosporidium were consistently low in the calculations however a reduction of up to 2 log10 and 4 log10 were estimated to be required within the main pool for campylobacter and norovirus respectively similar values applied to the kiddie pool when shedders were present these values were calculated for complete mixing and hence do not account for variability e g clumping in the pathogen concentration within the pool itself at any given time proximity to an infected shedder may substantially increase the momentary risks while this is potentially concerning it is the case with all recreational swimming activities where one is in close proximity to others in waters with no residual disinfectant what is referred to as the voluntary risk by individuals made aware of this risk when bathing with other people it was considered relevant to evaluate how well the proposed designed system could performs at various likely daily pathogen loads over each 8 or 12 h periods of use this was assessed in the simplest way using a box flow model with log10 reductions applied for each treatment barrier all the simulations presented in this study show that the key limitation to removal performance of the system was the flow rate through the external treatment barriers the maximum that could be achieved in a 24 h period in the main pool with normal flow rates regardless of treatment performance was around 1 log10 for all pathogens the alberta health swimming pool standards alberta health 2014 stipulate that a traditional chlorinated swimming pool constructed after november 2006 must have a turnover time of four hours while the turnover time for a recirculating water spray park is lower at two hours the standards also state that if a wading pool or recirculating water spray park is connected to a swimming pool the turnover time for the swimming pool shall apply to the wading pool or water spray park under the assumptions of the presented model a four hour turnover time would achieve less than 1 log10 reduction for all reference pathogens recently the provincial agency undertaking recreational water quality testing provlab moved to qpcr testing for enterococcus spp to indicate potential faecal contamination along with molecular testing for a human faecal marker hf183 to detect faecal loadings which are used on a daily basis at the edmonton nsp to inform management given that the full scale efficiency of the external filtration system is limited by turnover time lack of knowledge regarding the impact of zooplankton grazing on viable pathogen numbers in the water column is a critical data gap in assessing the safety of the system several studies have highlighted that pathogens are internalized by zooplankton in freshwater systems burnet et al 2017 connelly et al 2007 hahn and höfle 2001 the question however remains as to whether internalization leads to permanent removal inactivation of the pathogen or whether pathogens are actually protected and their survival enhanced by internalization bichai et al 2014 bichai et al 2008 neogi et al 2014 therefore not only is an approach for quantifying the internalization rate of pathogens by zooplankton under full scale conditions needed but also an understanding of the ultimate fate of internalized pathogens and what health risk they may pose to bathers in addition other internal inactivation processes including predation considering now the entire microbiome biofilm rather than zooplankton alone and sunlight disinfection may be important health protection mechanisms unfortunately the role of the natural microbiome in inactivation of pathogens is poorly understood and at this stage not quantifiable investigation of the microbial inactivation within the site specific water matrix of the nsp would be of great value while data does exist on sunlight inactivation of pathogens in fresh water bolton et al 2010 dahl et al 2017 davies colley et al 1999 fujioka and yoneyama 2002 mendez hermida et al 2005 silverman et al 2015 sinton et al 2007 sinton et al 2002 the relevance of these data to the nsp situation is uncertain sunlight is expected to be effective at the very surface however the extent that solar radiation can penetrate the water column is variable and likely to be affected by site specific water quality and resuspension of particulates due to bather activities in situ measurement of solar radiation during pool operation at appropriate depths would facilitate incorporation of sunlight disinfection kinetics from literature values to improve the safety of the system uv disinfection was a design suggestion for the pool water return lines however the inclusion of uv had limited benefit on overall performance during normal operation but could reduce the spread of infectious pathogens between pools following a faecal accident the uv disinfection units are considered to be particularly valuable on the outflow of the floor nozzles given the higher likelihood of faecal contamination by children in this zone and the need to protect the larger pools from this contamination the log10 reduction value assumed for viruses was based on calicivirus results reviewed by hijnen et al 2006 representative for human noroviruses 2 6 log10 but not as conservative as expected from some human adenovirus 0 5 log10 hence the protection provided by uv disinfection may be less for some human enteric viruses than shown by these preliminary modelling results for norovirus the predicted performance of the uv units was based on a review of published laboratory studies for a range of different pathogens hijnen et al 2006 there are two important limitations linked with using this laboratory data firstly the performance of uv disinfection in natural waters will be suppressed by the variable organic content of the water validation of the uv units would be required to ensure that the required effective uv dose is achieved using an approach similar to that recommended for drinking water treatment usepa 2006b secondly the impact of uv disinfection on the natural biome of the water column and hence the natural elimination efficiency of the overall system is poorly understood disrupting the natural biome through uv disinfection must be undertaken with caution overall in situ challenge testing trials are recommended once the system is operational to investigate the impact of the uv disinfection on microbial survival 5 conclusions a screening level risk assessment is a valuable starting point for assessing waterborne risks from enteric pathogens and to identify risk drivers and research needs even with the simplistic box flow model applied to the nsp described the following important lessons regarding the likely performance of the system were identified enteric pathogen risks associated with natural swimming pools depend upon how many swimmers are infected modelling pathogen concentration needs to account for the likelihood of one or more shedders being present the overall performance of the filtration system was driven by the system water turnover time and using the 11 and 4 h designed turnover time would achieve less than 1 log10 reduction for all reference pathogens evaluated natural disinfection mechanisms for nsp are poorly understood making reliance upon them for health protection in public pools challenging specific data is needed to better describe the fate of pathogens in natural waters and performance of natural filtration barriers in the nsp environment are poorly understood and challenge studies of in situ systems are recommended to reduce uncertainties in the current study declaration of competing

17424,natural swimming ponds nsps are artificially created bodies of water intended for human recreation characterised by the substitution of chemical disinfection with natural biological processes for water purification nsps are growing in popularity however little is known regarding the public health risks a screening level risk assessment was undertaken as an initial step in assessing the first canadian public nsp located in edmonton alberta risk of enteric pathogens originating from pool bathers was assessed under normal conditions and following accidental faecal release events the performance of the natural treatment train for health protection was quantified with and without the addition of uv disinfection of naturally treated water and compared to the us epa benchmark to provide a reference point to consider acceptability estimated levels of pathogen contamination of the pond were dependant upon the discrete number of shedders present which in turn depended upon the prevalence of infection in the population overall performance of the natural disinfection system was dependant upon the filtration rate of the natural treatment system or turnover time addition of uv disinfection reduced the uncertainty around the removal efficacy and mitigated the impact of larger shedding events however the impact of uv disinfection on the natural treatment biome is unknown further information is needed on the performance of natural barriers for pathogen removal and therefore challenge studies are recommended given the identified risks the pool is posted that there is risk from accidental faecal releases as in any natural water body with swimmers screening level risk assessment was a valuable first step in understanding the processes driving the system and in identifying important data gaps graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords qmra recreational water quality cryptosporidium norovirus campylobacter natural swimming ponds 1 introduction natural swimming ponds nsps are artificially created bodies of water intended for human recreation characterised by the substitution of chemical disinfection with natural biological processes for water purification the first nsp in recent times was built in austria in the early 1980s and by 2010 more than 20 000 nsps had been constructed of which a hundred were open to the public littlewood 2005 cited in casanovas massana and blanch 2013 despite the growing popularity of these natural systems little is known regarding the adequacy of the natural processes for enteric pathogen removal to provide adequate water quality for swimmers also it is well known by health authorities that most recreational disease is not identified in normal health surveillance programs fewtrell and kay 2015 hence the majority go unreported even though there may be significant impacts on society including lost work days dwight et al 2005 in general the chlorine resistant parasitic protozoan cryptosporidium hominis is the leading cause of gastroenteritis in swimming pools and results from faecal accidents releases suppes et al 2016 referred to in this paper as bather shedding human faeces may contain pathogens and is a known pathway of infection in recreational water environments chalmers 2012 dale et al 2010 graciaa et al 2018 pond 2005 hence in a natural pool without chemical disinfectant residual expected bather shedding of pathogens will go untreated until the pool water is passed through sufficient natural barriers with human enteric viruses the most numerous and infectious of these enteric pathogens ashbolt 2015 while the social and health benefits associated with recreational water environments are well recognized various outbreaks have been associated with microbiological contamination of recreational waters in natural ponds and lakes blostein 1991 paunio et al 1999 sinclair et al 2009 and inadequately disinfected swimming pools barna and kádár 2012 sinclair et al 2009 hence the efficacy and reliability of disinfection treatments natural or artificial is central to maintaining the microbial safety of recreational waters the design and operation of the first canadian nsp in edmonton was the focus of this microbial risk assessment the nsp treatment system designed by polyplan kreikenbaum group gmbh www polyplan umwelt de was part of a municipal pool upgrade as part of the planning process potential faecal pathogen risks were evaluated using a quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra framework it is recommended to undertake qmra at increasing levels of detail referred to as a tiered approach who 2016 beginning simply and only increasing complexity as needed this paper documents the first screening level risk assessment of pathogen risk undertaken of a nsp the objective of the screening level assessment was to characterize the system in a very simplistic way based on average flow rates within a simple box flow model and using available literature data assess factors driving illness risks from accidental ingestion of enteric viruses bacteria and parasitic protozoa and to identify future data collection needs for the purpose of quantify risks adequately to support health protection 2 materials and methods the nsp is part of a redevelopment of a public pool at borden park edmonton canada https www edmonton ca activities parks recreation borden park outdoor pool aspx the design consists of a large rectangular main pool a shallow children s pool referred to as kiddie pool and an area of floor nozzles designed for children s water play the water flow is connected between all pools see fig 1 via the pump well b1 and is directed to external filtration units neptune filter hydrobotanic and submerse filters for purification the public pool is fenced from wildlife and fed by potable water from the mains drinking water supply therefore the significant only source of faecal contamination considered in the assessment was from bathers the first step in any qmra is to undertake a problem formulation defining clearly the purpose and scope of the assessment who 2016 to address each class of microbial pathogen viral bacterial parasitic protozoan for the first tier in the qmra process the following reference pathogens were selected to represent each microbial group norovirus campylobacter jejuni and cryptosporidium hominis with norovirus and c jejuni representing some of the most prevalent pathogenic enteric viruses and bacteria reported in edmonton sewage banting et al 2016 qiu et al 2015 and known to infect recreational swimmers guy et al 2018 c hominis was selected as oocysts are known to be far more resistant to environmental decay processes than giardia cysts hamilton et al 2018 risk to adults and children were considered separately and compared with the gastrointestinal benchmark of the u s epa for freshwaters of 35 cases of gastroenteritis per 1000 swimming events epa 2012 exposure scenarios included in the risk assessment were for unintentional shedding during normal operation nominal load 252 adults and 17 children high bather load estimated as 1 5 times the nominal value 378 adults and 26 children and larger faecal release events first the magnitude of pathogen contamination due to unintentional bather shedding was estimated and the level of treatment required in order to achieve the benchmark risk was quantified the capacity of the designed filtration system for treating the pathogen load at the benchmark risk level was then assessed including the system response to larger pathogen release incidents the overall objective of the assessment was to assess the adequacy of the proposed treatment system for managing pathogen risks to bathers and to identify future research needs to better characterize safety 2 1 magnitude of pathogen contamination due to unintentional bather shedding enteric pathogens are transmitted by the faecal oral route and therefore the presence of pathogens in the water column is caused by shedding of faecal material by swimmers in this model the pathogen loading under typical operating conditions was estimated as n fs crp where n is the discrete number of people visiting the facility per day infected with a reference pathogen fs is the amount of faecal material grams shed per person per day and crp is the concentration of reference pathogens in the faeces of infected individuals organisms g 1 number of people shedding only infected people excrete pathogens the point prevalence of each of the reference pathogens was estimated in order to model the expected number of excreters present at the pool by day the point prevalence was estimated from the reported number of cases by week for the province of alberta canada for each pathogen using the formula p o i n t p r e v a l e n c e r u d 7 n 1 a where r is the reported number of cases per week u is the underreporting factor d is the duration of excretion days n is the population of alberta 4200 000 and a is the asymptomatic infection rate a summary of inputs is included in table 1 while campylobacterosis is a reportable illness in alberta cryptosporidiosis and norovirus infections are not and therefore data regarding the identified number of cases is not available for analysis the selection of a conservative on the high end of the realistic range weekly rate of reporting was made via discussions with alberta health services the number of visitors shedding shedders reference pathogens on any given day will be a discrete number given the number of visitors n and the point prevalence pp of shedding in the general population the discrete number of shedders on any given day was modelled using a binomial distribution with parameters n and pp a sample of the number of shedders was generated using monte carlo simulation 10 000 iterations faecal shedding unintentional shedding of faecal material by bathers is widely documented elmir et al 2009 elmir et al 2007 gerba 2000 the amount of faeces shed per person is highly uncertain and was estimated relying on measurements from the literature of faecal indicator concentrations in bathing waters details of this analysis is included in supplementary material given the uncertainty in shedding mass a reference distribution to describe the variability in faecal excretion was implemented in the model a reference distribution is recommended to explicitly represent a plausible range when there is a lack of data to fully describe a distribution who 2016 we chose a triangular distribution a distribution often used as a rough modelling tool where the range and most likely value within that range can be estimated vose 2008 for faecal excretion with a mode equal to 0 6 and lower and upper bounds of 0 06 and 6 gs pathogen shedding density reported concentrations of pathogens in the faeces shedding density is variable the shedding density appears to vary between individuals and over the course of an infection bambic et al 2011 reviewed the published data and reported the following relevant to our chosen reference pathogens a median campylobacter concentration of 107 cfu g 1 ranging 101 108 for norovirus the median was 108 copies g 1 and a range of 104 1010 and for cryptosporidium the median was 105 oocysts g 1 ranging 103 106 the range limits and medians were used to define triangular distributions for the shedding density of each reference pathogen using a model constructed in mathematica wolfram international version 11 1 a monte caro simulation 10 000 random samples was undertaken to obtain a random sample of the concentration of each reference pathogen in the main pool and the kiddie pool assuming complete mixing the sensitivity of the estimated concentration to each of the model input variables number of shedders pathogen density in faeces and magnitude of faecal shedding by bathers was evaluating using the spearman rank correlation coefficient to compare each of the input random samples with the generated concentration sample 2 2 assessment of treatment requirements qmra quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra was used to assess the amount of treatment required in order to achieve the u s epa benchmark risk using the approach illustrated in fig 2 and the sample of pathogen concentrations from unintentional bather shedding the required log10 reduction was estimated a random sample representing the variability in the treatment requirements was generated using the pathogen concentration samples described in the previous section a summary of the model input assumptions is included in table 2 2 3 pathogen reduction capacity of designed natural treatment system a simple box model was applied assuming complete mixing within each component of the model over each time step to evaluate the overall pathogen reduction capacity of the treatment system given the flow paths represented in fig 1 and the standard and maximum flow rates included in table 3 together with the assumed log10 removal capacity of each of the barriers the change in pathogen concentration over time was estimated five removal barriers were considered in the scoping of the qmra a wetland system consisting of zooplankton filtering a hydro botanic filter and submerse sand root filter a commercial designed neptune surface spray gravel media filter and uv disinfection fig 1 however there is very limited published data on the performance of these nsp barriers bruns and pepper 2019 so in combination with related literature estimates we provided reasonable point estimate and plausible ranges in log10 removals for each barrier to be applied within the screening level qmra model table 4 as such triangular distributions defined by mode min and max were selected to describe the variability and uncertainty associated with the log10 removals zooplankton filtering zooplankton grazing is proposed to provide important in situ disinfection in nsps bruns and peppler 2019 yet requires careful consideration as to how well it may be expected to perform as a barrier for protection of human health studies have shown that free living environmental protozoa can ingest human enteric bacteria and protozoan pathogens including cryptosporidium oocysts agasild and nõges 2005 connelly et al 2007 stott et al 2003 trout et al 2002 yet very little is known regarding the rate that zooplankton can clear oo cysts from the surrounding water however rates of 22 24 ml grazer 1 day 1 and 15 19 ml grazer 1 day 1 for cryptosporidium oocysts and giardia cysts respectively have been reported connelly et al 2007 the filtration capacity of zooplankton reported by eydeler and spieker 2010 cited in bruns and peppler 2019 ranged from 8 5 to 64 8 ml grazer 1 day 1 for rotatoria copepoda and cladocera protozoa the more pressing issue relates to the poorly documented fate of ingested pathogens within zooplankton and their faecal pellets rather than inactivate and digest all ingested pathogens there is growing evidence that pathogens may be concentrated within zooplankton where they may be protected from external environmental stressors ultimately favoring their survival bichai et al 2010 bichai et al 2014 bichai et al 2008 folkins et al 2020 tang et al 2011 so while faecal pellets may accumulate within sediments and on plant surfaces and unknown fraction may stay suspended or be resuspended for these reasons zooplankton filtering was not included as a barrier for pathogen removal within this screening level assessment of the nsp system hydro botanic and submerse filter two parallel filters were proposed in the design of the nsp including 1 hydro botanic filter with a bed thickness of 2 00 m and a design retention time of 6 8 h and 2 submerse filter with a bed thickness of 2 00 m and a design retention time of 4 5 h while these two filters operate in parallel regarding their likely removal efficiency they are considered here together due to the similarity of mechanisms mechanisms of pathogen removal within these filters include adsorption to soil and filter substratum predation noting issues identified for zooplankton filtering above sedimentation physical filtering of larger organisms and inactivation due to environmental exposure ph temperature sunlight only for the hydro botanic filter both filters have been estimated to achieve 10 reduction of e coli bruns and peppler 2019 limited data is available in the literature specifically for hydro botanic and submerse filters however a range of removal performances for microorganisms have been reported for wastewater systems using subsurface wetlands rock filters and reed beds reviewed by verbyla 2015 bacterial reductions are in the range of 1 25 2 5 log10 viruses 0 5 to 2 log10 and parasitic protozoa between 0 4 and 3 log10 adhikari et al 2013 bastos et al 2010 garcia et al 2010 gerba et al 1999 jackson and jackson 2008 karim et al 2004 reinoso et al 2008 stevik et al 2004 vidales contreras et al 2012 vidales et al 2003 vymazal 2005 however noting that a key driver of removal is often the retention time within the filter and retention times in these studies were typically in the order of days rather than hours proposed for the nsp while the design only assumes 10 removal for each of these filters it seems reasonable to assume that at least 1 log10 would be achieved for bacteria and protozoa with a lower value of 0 5 log10 for viruses neptune filter the neptune filter system has a gravel medium depth of 2 00 to 2 20 m and a retention time of 20 min was assumed by designers to have a higher e coli removal efficacy of 90 in comparison to the hydro botanic and submerse filters challenge studies with coliphage assumed to be a reasonable human enteric virus surrogate to mimic their on similar filters has shown between 95 and 99 reduction bruns and peppler 2019 uv disinfection uv disinfection is considered as an option in the design of the treatment system the most extensive meta analysis review of data relating to pathogen sensitivity to uv has is by hijnen et al hijnen et al 2006 inactivation of reference pathogens can be estimated from the models reported in this review for the expected uv doses at the nsp system of 25 mj cm 2 and 40 mj cm 2 for bacteria and protozoa estimated reductions were similar between reference pathogens of the same group i e e coli o157 h7 was similar to campylobacter and cryptosporidium was similar to giardia however for viruses there was a strong difference between adenoviruses compared to other enteric virus types ye et al 2018 while the values for norovirus inactivation are based on the calicivirus surrogate data from hijnen et al 2006 it is noted that if human adenovirus results were used the log10 would be 0 5 rather than 2 6 given a starting level of contamination of 500 campylobacter per l 10 000 norovirus per l and 10 cryptosporidium oocysts per l the flow path model was run to estimate the decrease in concentration over time and the subsequent log10 reduction in the main pool and the kiddie pool at 1 min time steps for 24 h the model was run with and without the proposed uv disinfection units given the importance of system water turnover time through treatment on the overall estimated pathogen reduction estimated log10 reductions were evaluated for turnover periods of 1 2 4 6 and 8 h noting that current design turnover of the main pool was specified at 11 and 7 4 h for standard and maximum flow rates respectively and in the kiddie pool 4 and 2 7 h respectively 2 5 event scenarios in addition to regular contamination the response of the system to a larger scale faecal release event was investigated the flow model was applied to assess the response to an accidental release by an ill swimmer the fate of a large pathogen release faeces or vomitus 1010 campylobacter 1012 norovirus and 108 cryptosporidium oocysts occurring in either the main pool kiddie pool or at the floor nozzles was modelled in all three locations over 24 h 3 results 3 1 normal operation estimated distribution of pathogen contamination the monte carlo sample of the number of shedders visiting the pool per day is illustrated for the main pool and the kiddie pool in figs 3 4 respectively the number of shedders was driven by the estimated point prevalence of each reference pathogen in the population table 1 with the assumption of random variation following the binomial distribution used with the highest point prevalence of norovirus 0 8 resulted in the highest estimated number of shedders reaching up to nine at high visitor loads the lowest point prevalence reference pathogen used cryptosporidium at 0 11 led to a high likelihood of zero shedders the resulting distribution of estimated pathogen concentration in the main pool and kiddie pool together with the required log10 reduction to achieve the benchmark risk level is summarised in table 5 and illustrated in figs 5 and 6 the highest loading and removal requirements were for enteric viruses ranging up to 4 5 log10 the risk from cryptosporidium under baseline shedding conditions was estimated to be extremely low the sensitivity of the estimated pathogen loadings to the model input variables is illustrated with the spearman rank correlation coefficient in fig 7 when prevalence was low the estimated concentration was primarily driven by the number of shedders present in the pool as the prevalence of infection increased for example from cryptosporidium to norovirus and hence the likelihood of one or more shedders increased the modelled concentration was then driven by the pathogen density in faeces 3 2 pathogen removal capacity of the treatment system the estimated decrease in average pathogen concentration over time and subsequent log10 reduction in the main swimming pool is illustrated for norovirus in fig 8 campylobacter and cryptosporidium are illustrated in figures s 2 and s 3 the lower 2 5 and upper 97 5 quantiles of the monte carlo simulation are illustrated with dashed lines around the solid median line in all cases the maximum log10 reduction that could be achieved over a 24 h period in the main pool both with and without the application of uv disinfection was around 1 log10 in each case the achievable log10 reduction was limited by the flow rate through the external filtration treatment system the dashed lines 95 quantile interval of the monte carlo sample represent the influence that the uncertainty in assumed pathogen removal performance by treatment had on the overall estimated reduction in pathogen concentration and hence the achieved log10 reduction this uncertainty was highest for viruses since a low reduction was assumed across treatment barriers and the plausible range included in the stochastic analysis was broad however the addition of uv disinfection eliminated the impact of this uncertainty on estimated pathogen reduction in all cases clearly demonstrating the limiting factor of system return flow rate and pool water dilution for the kiddie pool a higher overall log10 reduction could be achieved within the kiddie pool in comparison to the main pool due to the decrease in turnover time 4 h in comparison to 11 h for the main pool for the system flow rates illustrated in figures s 4 s 5 and s 6 the maximum achievable reduction in concentration with uv disinfection was more than 3 5 log10 for all pathogens with the maximum flow rate over 24 h the relationship between turnover time and achievable log10 reduction for each reference pathogen is illustrated in fig 9 reducing the turnover time increases the achievable log10 reduction nevertheless achieving greater than 3 log10 reduction in concentration over 8 h regardless of treatment barriers would require an hourly turnover time 3 3 event analysis aside from the unintentional faecal wash off assumed by normal bathing accidental faecal releases afr or vomitus releases can and do occur in public swimming pools this situation was modelled as an event that could occur in one of three locations the main pool the kiddie pool or the floor nozzles fig 2 the full results for event analysis are included in the supplementary material highest risks and hence greatest removal performance was required for norovirus followed by campylobacter even under the modelled event scenarios the risks from cryptosporidium were calculated to be low when the release occurred within the kiddie pool or the main pool the recovery of the system was slow within that pool uv disinfection did not improve this recovery period nevertheless uv disinfection reduced or prevented the risks being carried across the entire system for example for norovirus risks following an event in the kiddie pool figure s 8 uv disinfection reduced the peak reduction requirements in the main pool from over 4 log10 to below 2 log10 and the risk at the floor nozzles was reduced from requiring around 5 log10 to just over 2 log10 for campylobacter for a pathogen release in the main pool event 3 the inclusion of uv disinfection totally mitigated the risk in the kiddie pool or at the floor nozzle figure s 13 4 discussion it is well established that the prime source of pathogen risks in artificial swimming pools are the swimmers who unintentionally or accidentally due to illness shed pathogens into the water column hence we estimated the likely level of pathogen contamination of the edmonton natural swimming pool under normal operation and during potential event situations to explore how events and which pathogen groups may drive risk therefore risks were summed on a log scale and the combined risk of illness was driven by the highest risk group enteric viruses the approach applied for normal operation was based on the number of visitors to the pool and relied on assumptions regarding the incidence of infection in alberta and estimates of faecal and pathogen shedding from the literature the estimated concentration was variable and uncertain given the extreme ranges of values reported in the literature for example shedding of noroviruses was estimated to range from 101 to 107 copies g 1 nevertheless some important observations are made firstly given that not all individuals are expected to shed pathogens only those who are infected with low prevalence pathogens so the chance of no shedders present was relatively high for our simulations under nominal visitor loading there was more than 75 chance that no one would be shedding cryptosporidium on any given day these results highlight that the enteric pathogen risks can be transient and variable dependant upon the number of shedders present furthermore our prevalence calculations were likely to be an overestimate given that we assumed that all people would be equally likely to attend the pool regardless of their health status or whether they were recovering from an infection it is unlikely that an individual who was actively ill would desire to attend the nsp yet asymptomatic carriers would in the absence of quantitative estimates on this and recognizing that asymptomatic and extended shedding of pathogens over weeks post illness has been widely reported in the literature it seemed wise to be cautious with the prevalence estimates and include all cases it is important to note that the variability in the number of shedders is a critical driver of the pathogen risk and additional attention may be needed during periods of known higher community infection rates e g during an outbreak this points to the importance of public education programs that encourage those who are or who have been unwell to avoid swimming as signposted at the edmonton nsp a message perhaps made easier given the covid 19 pandemic when shedders were present and engaged in water activities the pathogen concentration and hence treatment requirements to maintain safety of other swimmers was estimated risk from cryptosporidium were consistently low in the calculations however a reduction of up to 2 log10 and 4 log10 were estimated to be required within the main pool for campylobacter and norovirus respectively similar values applied to the kiddie pool when shedders were present these values were calculated for complete mixing and hence do not account for variability e g clumping in the pathogen concentration within the pool itself at any given time proximity to an infected shedder may substantially increase the momentary risks while this is potentially concerning it is the case with all recreational swimming activities where one is in close proximity to others in waters with no residual disinfectant what is referred to as the voluntary risk by individuals made aware of this risk when bathing with other people it was considered relevant to evaluate how well the proposed designed system could performs at various likely daily pathogen loads over each 8 or 12 h periods of use this was assessed in the simplest way using a box flow model with log10 reductions applied for each treatment barrier all the simulations presented in this study show that the key limitation to removal performance of the system was the flow rate through the external treatment barriers the maximum that could be achieved in a 24 h period in the main pool with normal flow rates regardless of treatment performance was around 1 log10 for all pathogens the alberta health swimming pool standards alberta health 2014 stipulate that a traditional chlorinated swimming pool constructed after november 2006 must have a turnover time of four hours while the turnover time for a recirculating water spray park is lower at two hours the standards also state that if a wading pool or recirculating water spray park is connected to a swimming pool the turnover time for the swimming pool shall apply to the wading pool or water spray park under the assumptions of the presented model a four hour turnover time would achieve less than 1 log10 reduction for all reference pathogens recently the provincial agency undertaking recreational water quality testing provlab moved to qpcr testing for enterococcus spp to indicate potential faecal contamination along with molecular testing for a human faecal marker hf183 to detect faecal loadings which are used on a daily basis at the edmonton nsp to inform management given that the full scale efficiency of the external filtration system is limited by turnover time lack of knowledge regarding the impact of zooplankton grazing on viable pathogen numbers in the water column is a critical data gap in assessing the safety of the system several studies have highlighted that pathogens are internalized by zooplankton in freshwater systems burnet et al 2017 connelly et al 2007 hahn and höfle 2001 the question however remains as to whether internalization leads to permanent removal inactivation of the pathogen or whether pathogens are actually protected and their survival enhanced by internalization bichai et al 2014 bichai et al 2008 neogi et al 2014 therefore not only is an approach for quantifying the internalization rate of pathogens by zooplankton under full scale conditions needed but also an understanding of the ultimate fate of internalized pathogens and what health risk they may pose to bathers in addition other internal inactivation processes including predation considering now the entire microbiome biofilm rather than zooplankton alone and sunlight disinfection may be important health protection mechanisms unfortunately the role of the natural microbiome in inactivation of pathogens is poorly understood and at this stage not quantifiable investigation of the microbial inactivation within the site specific water matrix of the nsp would be of great value while data does exist on sunlight inactivation of pathogens in fresh water bolton et al 2010 dahl et al 2017 davies colley et al 1999 fujioka and yoneyama 2002 mendez hermida et al 2005 silverman et al 2015 sinton et al 2007 sinton et al 2002 the relevance of these data to the nsp situation is uncertain sunlight is expected to be effective at the very surface however the extent that solar radiation can penetrate the water column is variable and likely to be affected by site specific water quality and resuspension of particulates due to bather activities in situ measurement of solar radiation during pool operation at appropriate depths would facilitate incorporation of sunlight disinfection kinetics from literature values to improve the safety of the system uv disinfection was a design suggestion for the pool water return lines however the inclusion of uv had limited benefit on overall performance during normal operation but could reduce the spread of infectious pathogens between pools following a faecal accident the uv disinfection units are considered to be particularly valuable on the outflow of the floor nozzles given the higher likelihood of faecal contamination by children in this zone and the need to protect the larger pools from this contamination the log10 reduction value assumed for viruses was based on calicivirus results reviewed by hijnen et al 2006 representative for human noroviruses 2 6 log10 but not as conservative as expected from some human adenovirus 0 5 log10 hence the protection provided by uv disinfection may be less for some human enteric viruses than shown by these preliminary modelling results for norovirus the predicted performance of the uv units was based on a review of published laboratory studies for a range of different pathogens hijnen et al 2006 there are two important limitations linked with using this laboratory data firstly the performance of uv disinfection in natural waters will be suppressed by the variable organic content of the water validation of the uv units would be required to ensure that the required effective uv dose is achieved using an approach similar to that recommended for drinking water treatment usepa 2006b secondly the impact of uv disinfection on the natural biome of the water column and hence the natural elimination efficiency of the overall system is poorly understood disrupting the natural biome through uv disinfection must be undertaken with caution overall in situ challenge testing trials are recommended once the system is operational to investigate the impact of the uv disinfection on microbial survival 5 conclusions a screening level risk assessment is a valuable starting point for assessing waterborne risks from enteric pathogens and to identify risk drivers and research needs even with the simplistic box flow model applied to the nsp described the following important lessons regarding the likely performance of the system were identified enteric pathogen risks associated with natural swimming pools depend upon how many swimmers are infected modelling pathogen concentration needs to account for the likelihood of one or more shedders being present the overall performance of the filtration system was driven by the system water turnover time and using the 11 and 4 h designed turnover time would achieve less than 1 log10 reduction for all reference pathogens evaluated natural disinfection mechanisms for nsp are poorly understood making reliance upon them for health protection in public pools challenging specific data is needed to better describe the fate of pathogens in natural waters and performance of natural filtration barriers in the nsp environment are poorly understood and challenge studies of in situ systems are recommended to reduce uncertainties in the current study declaration of competing
