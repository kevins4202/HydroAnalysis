2960,karst springs serve as major drinking water sources for the global population yet there remains uncertainty regarding how contaminants like sediment are routed through karst we find knowledge gaps pertaining to the processes that control the timing and magnitude of sediment delivery to close these knowledge gaps we 1 collected high frequency sediment and conductivity data from three surface streams and two cave sites in the inner bluegrass region of kentucky usa 2 analyzed sediment hysteresis for 51 storm events over a two year period 3 numerically modeled sediment transport through the aquifer and 4 contextualized our results with a meta analysis of ten karst springs in europe and north america our results showed that 80 of storm events derived their sediment from external inputs through sinking streams while the remaining 20 were characterized by only internal resuspension of previously deposited cave sediment we found that internal sediment transport was proportional to fluid shear stress in the cave and occurred exclusively during fully saturated aquifer conditions prior to the storm event during partially saturated aquifer conditions externally sourced sediment pulses were efficiently routed to the spring irrespective of shear in the conduit network sediment hysteresis in surface streams was clockwise whereas the cave sites experienced counter clockwise behavior clockwise and counter clockwise hysteresis typically refer to proximal and distal sourcing for streams but our findings suggest that this interpretation is not valid for subsurface karst settings hysteresis patterns for karst show dependence on the antecedent water conditions in the aquifer and internal versus external sourcing meta analysis results show that despite high variability counter clockwise patterns of sediment hysteresis are very common for karst which contrasts sediment hysteresis in surface streams results suggest that external sediment loading rather than internal resuspension is the most common control of sediment load at springs which should inform management of karst groundwater resources keywords sediment transport karst sediment sources hysteresis antecedent conditions sediment timing data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction twenty five percent of the world s drinking water originates from karst aquifers leibundgut 1998 which are particularly susceptible to contamination due to fast travel times in the subsurface white 2002 we find knowledge gaps regarding the sediment transport processes in karst which limits our ability to accurately formulate predictive equations and understand the timing and source of sediment arriving at karst springs two decades ago white 2002 reported sediment transport in karst as an open topic with many areas that still need to be investigated since that time scientists advanced our understanding of sediment transport in karst aquifers and cave systems with results such as the occurrence of internal erosion of stored sediment in caves and externally sourced sediment transport from sinking streams during storm events herman et al 2008 goldscheider et al 2010 a suite of erosion deposition and transport processes potentially occurring in karst caves herman et al 2008 reed et al 2010 and the control of hydraulic conveyance limits on the sediment transport carrying capacity of the flow husic et al 2017a b however prediction methods and interpretation of hydrologic data remains understudied for sediment transport in karst despite the potential detrimental impacts of sediment on drinking water sediment transport in karst relies on both external and internal processes herman et al 2008 goldscheider et al 2010 external sediment sources can be transported into the subsurface through surficial connections to the karst aquifer which include sinkholes and sinking streams white 2002 the high permeability of karst aquifers defined by fracture networks and cave systems enables this external sediment to transport relatively quickly to karst springs sediment deposits can also occur in caves as the transport capacity of the fluid reduced due to the loss in flow energy from sinking streams entrance husic et al 2017a these sediment deposits become internal sediment that can be resuspended in subsequent hydrologic events dogwiler wicks 2004 reed et al 2010 however the distribution of hydrologic events causing transport of internal and external sediment and the processes controlling their transfer remains an advancement needed for prediction cheng et al 2020 nerantzaki et al 2015 sediment hysteresis is a method to infer sediment sources and transport processes e g williams 1989 hysteresis refers to the asynchronous behavior between two processes such as sediment and discharge and sediment and conductivity as mentioned by a recent literature review by liu et al 2021 the processes and mechanisms behind hysteresis patterns are not fully understood one common inference of sediment concentration versus discharge hysteresis is a clockwise pattern indicates an easily depleted sediment source lying proximal to the measurement point while a counter clockwise pattern suggests a distal source from the measurement point williams 1989 lefrançois et al 2007 eder et al 2010 eludoyin et al 2017 zarnaghsh and husic 2021 recently published a fundamental study uses sediment continuity modelling with experiments and supports the proximal and distal inference for surface streams juez et al 2021 however the process pattern linkage has primarily been applied to surface streams and remains under studied for karst springs sediment concentration versus electrical conductivity hysteresis may also be useful for inferring processes in karst because conductivity is often distinct for surface water and groundwater dahaan et al 2016 clockwise patterns are reported to indicate sediment resuspension in karst caves while counter clockwise patterns indicate sediment deposition fournier et al 2006 schiperski et al 2015 valdes et al 2006 however the linkage of the interpretation to processes has not been carefully examined sediment hysteresis applications and interpretation for karst systems have been generally limited to hysteresis being part of broader objectives to characterize various facets of karst systems lloyd et al 2016 point out that hysteresis results from systems with fractures and caves can be of high complexity but a useful way to provide a cross comparison of different sites and events because karst springs differ so strongly from fluvial streams in their hydrologic controls we hypothesize that the conventional interpretation of hysteresis patterns for karst will differ from that of surface systems the objectives were to 1 gain knowledge of karst sediment transport behavior particularly with respect to internal versus external controls on loading and 2 advance interpretation sediment hysteresis patterns and their inference in karst basins to meet these objectives we analyze of a new dataset from sinking streams and phreatic cave sites for an epigenetic karst basin in the inner bluegrass region of kentucky usa carry out numerical modelling and perform meta analysis of published sediment datasets for karst 2 methods 2 1 study site the study site was the cane run watershed 62 km2 and royal spring karst groundwater basin 58 km2 located in the inner bluegrass region of central kentucky usa the surface stream network of cane run creek which carries water and sediment during storm events is densely packed with over 60 swallets in stream sinkholes along its length husic et al 2017a these swallets partially redirect water and sediment to the subsurface karst system together cane run and royal spring form a surface and sub surface coupled drainage basin with mature karst development a primary cave approximately 5 5 m2 in cross sectional area drains groundwater to royal spring which provides drinking water for the city of georgetown fraley 2019 royal spring is the largest perennial spring in the inner bluegrass region currens et al 2015 this karst cave has been studied by many including husic et al 2017a b and al aamery et al 2021 providing evidence that the aquifer is always phreatic while the overlaying epigenetic aquifer has varying levels of saturation phreatic conduits are very common and have been studied by white 2002 drysdale et al 2001 massei et al 2003 herman et al 2008 and others a description of the soils and geology of the royal spring basin can be found in husic et al 2017a b we chose five sampling locations fig 1 including three surface sites in the cane run creek network and two sites along the primary cave system surface site 1 and surface site 2 drain urban and rural portions respectively of cane run creek surface site 3 is situated at the outlet of upper cane run creek watershed the two cave sites are located in the longitudinal upper section of the cave termed the upstream cave site and at the spring where the cave daylights termed the downstream cave site at royal spring 2 2 data collection and quality control in situ pressure transducers were installed at surface sites 1 2 and 3 to collect water depth data in 10 minute intervals a stage discharge relationship was used to calculate the water flowrate values from the stage height recordings of the pressure transducers husic 2015 at the upstream cave site a pressure transducer was installed in a monitoring well to measure stage and a stage discharge relationship was established using velocity measurements in the conduit deployed temporarily in the well husic 2015 the united states geological survey usgs gage station 032881100 provided flowrate data for the downstream cave site sensor platforms were used measure the turbidity and the electrical conductivity data were collected at the three surface sites and upstream cave site using ysi 6920v2 2 multiparameter water quality sondes connected to campbell scientific cr 20 data loggers at a 10 minute resolution husic 2015 data were collected at the downstream cave site using a ysi 6600v2 multiparameter sonde and a ysi 600 oms v2 optical sonde connected to campbell scientific cr 1000 data logger total suspended sediment tss samples were used to establish relationships with turbidity so that continuous turbidity data could be used as a tss surrogate e g walling et al 2006 tss samples were collected with teledyne isco 6712 automated pump samplers during storm events grab samples were collected at approximately on a weekly basis at all locations the samples were returned to the lab where they were processed through 0 45 µm whatman filters to retain the sediment and used to estimate sediment mass usepa 1999 surrogate relationships between tss and turbidity were established with regression optimized through the data separately for each site cao et al 2021 drysdale et al 2001 quality control of data followed several steps detailed in bettel 2021 and outlined here in brief water flowrate at the spring was corrected using data from the georgetown water treatment plant gwtp to account for their intake located upstream of the usgs gage all instrumentation was checked weekly for power concerns damage by flow events electrical short circuiting or animals chewing on instruments and data were downloaded and batteries switched at that time the sensor probes and connecting cables were cleaned and calibrated following the steps of the manufacturer raw data at the spring were evaluated for erroneous data with the help of the gce data toolbox a software for metadata based processing analysis visualization and transformation of environmental data georgia coastal ecosystems lter n d run in matlab version 2021b the toolbox was applied to evaluate each data point for possible errors that arose during data collection categorization of problems associated with data included invalid data range questionable data not expected to be recorded but are physically possible under certain circumstances percentage for flagging data points for checking with a large change in their value standard deviation flagging to mark outliers in the dataset and missing data points for periods during which the datalogger was not supplied with power during the quality control process monthly data quality reports were completed and are archived in clare 2019 and bettel 2021 2 3 event analyses of data hysteresis and mixing modelling we identified hydrologic storm events for periods during which all three parameters discharge q total suspended solids tss and electric conductivity ec measurements were available fig 1 sampled events highlighted in red events were manually extracted starting at the point at which a pronounced increase in discharge was observed and ending when flow had returned to pre event conditions or when a new event started each event was evaluated for its duration and the magnitude and timing of initial peak and ending values of q tss and ec the parameters were each normalized by creating percentiles using their respective event maxima so that cross site and cross event analyses could be carried out cao et al 2021 fournier et al 2006 lloyd et al 2016 to further facilitate cross event comparison all sites were adjusted to a common time datum corresponding to t 0 when the respective hydrographs reached their maximum flowrate event analyses included data from 25 h before the hydrograph peak to 75 h after the hydrograph peak this event duration allows focus on the important information without omitting any substantial data associated with the precipitation events as events do not typically show pulses in q tss or ec 75 h after the hydrograph peak see fig s1 a few uncharacteristic events did show additional pulses at late time periods in the event and these events were sampled during an in stream construction operation in cane run creek see fig s2 we carried out hysteresis analysis following visual and quantitative methods the tss q and tss ec hysteresis patterns were observed after plotting the normalized data several metrics commonly applied in hysteresis analyses were calculated for each event and then were evaluated separately and cumulatively liu et al 2021 zarnaghsh and husic 2021 tss peak lag time was calculated as 1 ts s lag t max q t max t s s where t max q is the time at which q reaches its maximum flow t max t s s the time at which tss reaches its maximum concentration the hysteresis index was calculated as 2 hi tss i rl tss i fl n where hi is the hysteresis index of normalized discharge tss i rl is the normalized sediment concentration on the rising limb at percentile i tss i fl is the normalized sediment concentration on the falling limb at percentile i and n is the number of percentiles i cao et al 2021 heathwaite bieroza 2020 lloyd et al 2016 the flushing index fi was calculated as 3 fi tss max q tss min q max t s s where tss q max is the total suspended solids concentration at qmax and tss q o is the total suspended solids concentration at the beginning of the event heathwaite bieroza 2020 histograms were plotted for tss lag times hi and fi to investigate distributions and the mode mean variance skewness and kurtosis were calculated and analyzed we performed end member unmixing with ec as the tracer to separate the contribution of water sources in the aquifer from surface derived runoff in the sinking streams and antecedent groundwater in the karst aquifer ec has been deemed fairly conservative for surface and groundwater mixing during storm events massei et al 2003 pellerin et al 2008 the solution is algebraic for two sources and one tracer as 4 ec i t ec i b x i b ec i r x i r a n d 5 x i b x i r 1 where ecb is the conductivity of the baseflow groundwater ecr is the conductivity of the runoff and ect is the total conductivity at timestep i and x indicates the mass fractions the mass fractions use the ratio of volumetric flowrates for incompressible flow as 6 x i b q i b q i t 7 x i r q i r q i t where q i t is the total averaged flow at timestep i q i b is the baseflow at timestep i and q i r is the stormflow at timestep i we carried out hysteresis loops for the unmixed signal including runoff and tss concentrations at each site we plotted q r against the tss concentrations for the 15 minute intervals identified looping direction 2 4 fluvial erosion modelling in the cave we modelled fluid shear stress τ f sediment flux q ss and commonly reported fluvial erosion formula for the cave the analysis was carried out to investigate potential evidence that fluid shear stress in the cave controls sediment flux of internally sourced sediment transported through the cave fluid shear stress was modelled using the darcy weisbach approach as 8 τ f 1 8 f ρ v 2 where the fluid shear stress τ f is in pa f is the darcy weisbach friction factor and is dimensionless ρ is the fluid density kg m 3 and v is the bulk streamwise velocity through the cave m s 1 the friction factor was parameterized for the primary cave of the royal spring groundwater basin in husic et al 2017b and was carried forward herein velocity was estimated every 15 min using the usgs measurements for water flowrate and approximation of the cave s bathymetry the shape of the underground cave was estimated as elliptical based on our previous research of the spring and the elliptical long diameter was estimated as 6 m while the elliptical short diameter was 0 9 m this estimate is based on a great deal of historic research of the cave bathymetry over the past 40 years by the kentucky geological survey kgs and researchers at the university of kentucky dye tracers were used to find connectivity of the cave system across the extent as well as travel time for different hydrologic conditions within the cave by spangler 1982 taylor 1992 and paylor and currens 2004 thrailkill and gouzie 1984 investigated linear velocity cave geometry and conveyance in the conduit and tripathi 2009 used electrical resistivity to determine the footprint of the cave the kgs used down hole images in combination with doppler sonar instruments to determine the approximate geometry of the conduit husic 2015 the combined results of the mentioned methods made it possible to estimate the general shape of the cave which was estimated as an elliptical conduit i e an average short diameter in the vertical direction of 0 9 m and an average long diameter in the transverse direction of 6 2 m husic 2015 husic et al 2017a b sediment flux was estimated every 15 min using the sediment sensor and water flowrate measurements the potential of the fluvial erosion process controlling erosion of internal sediment in the cave and in turn controlling sediment flux was assessed using the fluvial erosion formula of partheniades the partheniades equation is a widely used erosion and resuspension formula for cohesive sediment and is given as 9 ε a eff k d τ f τ c m where ε is the sediment flux via the fluvial erosion process g s a eff is a supply term defined as the effective area of the cave bed supplying sediment k d is the erodibility coefficient τ c is the critical shear stress pa and m is the erodibility exponent and is near 1 the erodibility coefficient was parameterized as a function of τ c following the work of hanson and simon 2001 the effective area reflects the concept that some portions of the cave bed are covered with fluvial sediment and other portions of the bed are bedrock with no available fluvial sediment in this way the potential to adjust a eff for different conditions was investigated 2 5 numerical modelling of sediment pulses in the karst aquifer numerical modelling using the conservation of mass for water and sediment was carried out to simulate the effect of an externally sourced sediment pulse that enters the subsurface and transports through the aquifer and cave system during a storm event a sediment pulse from the sinking streams was input using the sediment concentration data water and sediment routing through the upper aquifer was accomplished via a reservoir model approach for the system e g husic et al 2019 routing through the cave system was accomplished by discretizing the cave and treating the system as pipeflow e g husic et al 2017b al aamery et al 2021 the model was formulated for the karst aquifer as a reservoir and the cave system as 10 d s res dt q sw q gw q cave i n 11 d tss res s res dt tss sw q sw tss gw q gw tss cave q cave i n 12 d s cave dt q cave i n q cave o u t a n d 13 d tss cave s cave dt tss cave i n q cave i n tss cave o u t q cave o u t the first two equations were setup for the karst aquifer reservoir that is modelled as an unsteady flow detention basin and the second two equations are for the phreatic that is modelled as pipeflow s and tss indicate water storage m3 and sediment concentration g l 1 and subscripts sw gw cave in and cave out indicate swallet water from the sinking streams groundwater recharge from the fracture flow and phreatic matrix draining the soil and epikarst cave water inputs and cave outputs respectively parameterization of model fluxes and model discretization was accomplished using commonly applied karst reservoir routing formula and conduit approaches hartmann et al 2014 husic et al 2017b 2019 a reservoir approach was applied to both the exit from the karst aquifer to the cave and the groundwater recharge from fractures and the rock matrix as 14 q α s res β where α and β are reservoir coefficients the storage in the karst aquifer was treated as the product of the reservoir depth and effective area sres hresaeff a constant value was applied for the sinking streams net water flowrate recharging the karst aquifer via the swallets and this input was adjusted to zero when the karst aquifer was saturated these assumptions are reasonable given the 50 plus swallets for which subsequent filling and overtopping has been observed in the creek system the equations were discretized in time and one reservoir was used for the system following the work of husic et al 2019 and five cave segments were modelled the unsteady terms were set to zero in the cave since the cave is always phreatic and therefore the water flowrate at the spring was useful to set initial conditions for the karst aquifer coefficients of the reservoir fluxes the effective area of the aquifer were adjusted to agree with mean water flow rate conditions at the cave s spring sediment concentration from the sinking streams entering the aquifer via swallets was set to match the surface stream sediment concentration mean distribution given the relative similarities across events sediment deposition and erosion in the cave were assumed to be equal in amount and therefore were not included in the simulations so that we could isolate impacts of mixing the sediment laden surface derived water with the clear water groundwater in the aquifer and observe the constraint on water discharge in the cave that slows the transport velocity 3 results 3 1 internal and external sources of sediment during events results from data collection at royal spring produced 51 individual hydrologic events with coinciding turbidity and conductivity data fig 1 despite hydrograph responses at the spring 10 events had no pronounced pulses of tss or ec and two events showed irregular behavior and were difficult to interpret fig 2 the remaining 39 events showed pronounced tss and ec pulses in temporal proximity to q peaks fig 2 close examination of the 10 sedigraphs with no observable pulses showed tss experienced a slight increase and then decreased with the rising and falling limb of the hydrograph fig 2 however this dependence was very low in comparison to other 39 events that exhibited a noticeable sediment pulse the sediment pulses occurred in conjunction with the hydrograph response albeit at times out of phase with q and included a steep incline in tss peaking which was then followed by a decrease to pre event tss conditions we examined factors controlling the presence or absence of sediment pulses observed at the spring for the 39 and 10 events respectively the peak water flowrate for each event as measured at the spring showed no significance as a factor controlling the classification of events as showing the presence or absence of the sediment pulses p value 0 21 two tail t test assuming unequal variances however the hydrograph range qrange clustered to two types of event and significantly controlled classification of the events as showing the presence or absence of sediment pulses p value 0 005 qrange is defined as the difference between the peak water flowrate and the pre event flowrate for each individual event eight of the 10 events with no tss and ec pulse had a qrange less than 0 5 cms while 32 out of 39 events with tss and ec pulse had a qrange greater than 0 5 cms the clustering metric is not absolute but qrange does separate 82 of the events and suggests an underlying hydrologic process we attribute the absence of pulses in the sedigraphs and chemographs fig 2 left column to saturated conditions for the karst aquifer at the start of the event a pre event condition of saturated aquifer prevents externally sourced sediment transported into the aquifer by preventing high tss runoff water from entering the cave the surface streams overtop the swallet openings and in turn a relatively small increase in water flowrate is observed at the spring i e 0 5 cms increase in q at royal spring this interpretation is consistent with the ec distribution on the other hand the presence of pulses in the sedigraphs and chemographs fig 2 right column provide evidence that externally sourced sediment has entered the cave events with the presence of an ec pulse show a sharp decrease of ec consistent with recharge from the surface streams to the karst aquifer the results suggest that only sediment internal to the karst cave was transported during events with no tss or ec pulse while both internal and externally derived sediment was transported to royal spring during events with tss and ec pulses fluvial erosion modelling results for the cave supported the separation of the 10 events with no tss and ec pulses and 39 events with pulses as internal sediment only and combined internal external sediment respectively fig 3 sediment flux estimated from the measured data qss is plotted as a function of fluid shear stress in the cave τf for the 10 events with no tss and ec pulse fig 3a and for data from a sample of events with pulses fig 3b sediment flux shows a direct dependence on fluid shear stress in the cave for the events with no tss and ec pulses we interpret this result to reflect the process of fluvial erosion in the cave in which fluid shear stress at the floor of the cave causes internal sediment transport sediment flux shows a dependence on fluid shear stress in the cave for some of the data collected for events with pulses however the majority show clustering and scattered behavior with no clear dependence on shear stress in the cave we interpret this result to reflect mixed processes of fluvial erosion in the cave and sediment influx to the cave through swallets from the sinking streams indicating both internal and externally sourced sediment transport we plot the fluvial erosion formula modified from partheniades via the work for silt sized sediment by hanson and simon 2001 the fluvial erosion formula was optimized well for data from events that showed no pulses in fig 3a however much of the data in fig 3b does not agree with the fluvial erosion formula owing to the interpretation that this is externally originated sediment that moves through the system as a pulse of sediment 3 2 time series results time series results for events with sediment pulses showed a shift in behavior longitudinally in the basin from surface sites to royal spring indicating increased water and sediment retention the longitudinal trends are seen when observing hydrographs q versus time sedigraphs tss versus time and chemographs ec versus time data from the cane run streams the upper cave site and downstream cave site at royal spring fig 4 the mean distributions dashed black lines in fig 4 a e show the base of the hydrograph widens reflecting increased residence time of surface derived runoff and in turn longer duration events moving from upstream to downstream the time series at surface site 1 shows the sharpest hydrograph peak and the narrowest base followed by surface site 2 surface site 3 upstream cave site and with the widest base the downstream cave site for the surface streams the shifts are expected because of an increase in drainage area across the three locations for the cave the longer duration hydrographs and sedigraphs reflect an increase in water and sediment retention time with some events showing the cave hydrographs extending an order of magnitude longer than the duration of hydrographs in the surface streams the water velocity in the cave is on average 16 of the water velocity in the surface streams this result agrees with water conveyance estimates in the karst aquifer and conveyance is greatly reduced in the cave relative to the surface streams because the cave experiences pipeflow mechanics and thus is limited in its cross section al aamery et al 2021 sediment concentration and electrical conductivity time series results from the cave sites point toward externally sourced sediment and water the sedigraphs and chemographs show consistent pulses during the events the mean sedigraph pulses at each site dashed black lines in fig 4 f j had a general inverse agreement with the mean chemograph pulses dashed black lines in fig 4 k o the surface sites show primary sediment pulses attributed to surface erosion and sediment transport as runoff is generated surface sites 2 and 3 show secondary pulses attributed to streambank erosion in the main corridor as these sites show the greater height of streambanks and experienced degradation the past decade bettel 2021 the chemographs show pronounced negative pulses at surface sites consistent with the observation that ec of runoff in surface streams is typically considerably lower than that of groundwater e g dahaan et al 2016 these transfers of water and sediment to the subsurface karst are visually evident as primary pulses are observable although elongated in duration due to the previously mentioned increase in residence time instantaneous sedigraph results at royal spring colored lines in fig 4j showed examples of observed primary and secondary pulses attributed to surface and bank erosion transferred from the sinking streams 3 3 tss q hysteresis results of hysteresis patterns and metrics for sediment concentration as a function of water flowrate tss q hysteresis show a shift in behavior from clockwise patterns for the surface stream to figure eight at the upstream cave site to counter clockwise patterns and very high variability at royal spring see mean loops and instantaneous loops in fig 5 out of the 39 events that showed tss and ec pulses visually 19 were clearly counter clockwise 0 were clearly clockwise 5 events were a figure eight pattern showing clockwise and counter clockwise loops 9 events appeared linear and 6 events showed complex patterns that were difficult to summarize of the 39 events 29 events showed a positive tsslag indicating more counter clockwise behavior 8 events showed a negative tsslag indicating clockwise hysteresis and two events showed a tsslag equal to zero indicating linear behavior the mode of the tsslag shifts from 5 h to 5 h for surface streams to the cave indicating a shift to counter clockwise behavior at royal spring fig 6 the central mode of the hysteresis index hi shifts from 0 3 for surface stream sites to 0 15 at the upstream cave site to 0 15 at royal spring where a negative hi indicates counter clockwise the central mode for the flushing index shifts from 0 85 for the surface stream sites to 0 6 for the upstream cave site to 0 2 at royal spring the flushing index indicates the system shifts from an almost exclusive concentration response at the surface to a mixed concentration and dilution response at royal spring variability of hysteresis shows that hi ranges from 0 4 to 0 3 at royal spring demonstrating that various degrees of counter clockwise and clockwise patterns that reflect the varying arrivals of tss pulses surface streams are reported to most often show clockwise patterns for tss q hysteresis hamshaw et al 2018 cao et al 2021 and our results in the cane run stream network agrees with this result clockwise hysteresis patterns are typically interpreted as erosion of proximal close by sediment sources that are easily transported during a hydrologic event cao et al 2021 in surface streams the clockwise pattern is common because the sediment sources are close to the measurement location of the instrument causing the sediment peak to occur early in the event before the hydrograph peak lloyd et al 2016 this interpretation is reasonable for the surface streams of cane run creek because the primary sediment source is stored sediment in the ephemeral network which is entrained during the rising limb of the hydrograph the shift to commonly shown counter clockwise pattern with high variability for tss q hysteresis at karst spring are unique results to the literature and counter clockwise patterns are less commonly reported for sediment hysteresis hamshaw et al 2018 krajewski et al 2018 lloyd et al 2016 although some work has shown that intense urbanization pushes streams toward counter clockwise behavior zarnaghsh and husic 2021 the common interpretation of counter clockwise patterns for tss q hysteresis is dominance of sediment transport from distal far away sediment sources that are not well connected to the measurement location of the instrument juez et al 2018 zarnaghsh and husic 2021 however this interpretation may not hold for sediment hysteresis in karst caves the hysteresis in the cave varies between clockwise and counter clockwise depending on events with net counter clockwise behavior this behavior is likely a function of pre event water storage in the karst aquifer numerical modeling results and comparison with data support the dependence of counter clockwise and clockwise hysteresis on the pre event water storage in the aquifer the data and numerical modeling results show that the modelled variation of the tsslag as a function of the time for the rising limb of the hydrograph trl in which the latter can be used as a surrogate to determine pre event water storage conditions within the aquifer fig 7 a b high trl occurs because the aquifer is initially unsaturated and takes a long time to fill while low trl occurs because the aquifer is initially near saturation and takes a shorter time to fill the saturation state of the aquifer as a function of the rising limb time is illustrated in fig 7 when simulated as initially unsaturated i e near empty fig 7c the aquifer takes approximately 60 h to fill with water and for the water flowrate to reach its peak flow i e time for rising limb trl when simulated as initially saturated i e near full fig 7d the aquifer takes approximately 10 h to fill with water and for the water flowrate to reach its peak flow i e time for rising limb trl this result is consistent with conceptualizing the karst aquifer as a reservoir with the primary phreatic cave as the reservoir outlet the consistent behavior of the saturation states on sediment transport was also shown via the modelling i e fig 7 sediment results storm events with an initially saturated aquifer and thus short trl have longer and net positive tsslag times while events with an initially unsaturated karst aquifer show long trl and negative tsslag times this concept can be seen visually in time series results from the numerical model of fig 7c where sediment transport occurs for an event with an initially unsaturated karst aquifer the tss peak occurs before the hydrograph peak similar to a surface stream fig 7d shows the modeling results for an event with an initially saturated aquifer the sediment peak response is delayed due to the transport of clear water to the spring and pressure response of the system for the nine data points on the top shown in fig 7a we qualify that there is no visual dependence of tsslag on trl these events occurred during the months from february to september 2018 when stream restoration contractors were restoring an approximately 1 6 km reach of the streambanks in the upper portion of the cane run creek this restoration activity intersected with the rain events of springtime 2018 which was the wettest year on the 150 year precipitation record from 1870 to 2020 bettel 2021 the very high tsslag values are attributed to streambank erosion on the falling limb of the surface hydrographs during this time period fig 4j bettel 2021 results suggest the tss q hysteresis for the karst cave is a function of the pre event water storage of the aquifer this contradicts the idea that the system shifts from proximal to distal sources royal spring shows both counter clockwise and clockwise behavior for different events fig 6 and both patterns reflect the same external source of sediment from the sinking streams that is transported through the cave the arrival of the sediment pulse is interpreted as a function of the initial water storage in the aquifer as opposed to the spatial location of the source an aquifer that is initially unsaturated or dry will show arrival of the tss pulse prior to qpeak and exhibit clockwise behavior similar to a surface stream an aquifer that is nearly saturated will show a tss pulse after qpeak and exhibit counter clockwise behavior because the pressure response of the pre stored clear aquifer water arrives at the spring prior to the tss pulse 3 4 tss ec hysteresis results results of sediment concentration and electrical conductivity tss ec hysteresis provide evidence about the sources of water and sediment in the surface streams and the cave clockwise tss ec hysteresis loops occurred for all sites including the cave and spring sites fig 8 a e the main mode of sediment transport is from runoff water that arrives at each site causing the ec values to drop as well as the tss values increase we also used mixing analyses for water sources and carry out hysteresis and the hysteresis analyses of tss and surface runoff support the tss ec hysteresis interpretation the general trend from the upstream surface sites to the downstream cave site is that as the sites move further down and the amount of runoff qr at the total hydrograph qt peak decreases this trend is observed for the runoff qr contribution at the tss peak time the further downstream in the cave the site is located the less runoff is contributing to the total flow at the time the tss peak occurs regardless the tss qrunoff hysteresis loops are consistently clockwise patterns and agree with the tss ec results the tss ec hysteresis is valuable because it isolates the water s runoff origin and relationship to the sediment results provide evidence that all sediment pulse are from the same source external sediment that transports to the subsurface karst from the sinking streams in this manner the tss ec hysteresis removes the effect of the pre event storage of water in the karst aquifer and shows that sediment is not distal or proximal in all cases the tss peak occurs before the ec peak because the tss pulse occurs during the rising limb of the runoff hydrograph as entrainment occurs at the surface 4 discussion 4 1 sediment transport in karst results lead to a conceptual model for behavior of sediment transport in the phreatic karst system and interpretation of hysteresis patterns fig 9 three modes of sediment transport behavior in the karst cave are conceptualized including 1 internal sediment transport with no hysteresis at the spring 2 externally sourced sediment transport with counter clockwise hysteresis and 3 externally sourced sediment transport with clockwise hysteresis all three modes of sediment transport are hypothesized to be a function of initial water storage in the karst aquifer as indicated with saturated and unsaturated rock matrices these aquifer conditions include initially saturated initially partially saturated and nearly empty of water initially the unsteady sediment arrival to the aquifer also controls externally sourced sediment transport in modes two and three the first mode of sediment transport in the karst cave is internal sediment transport only with no hysteresis at the spring top panel in fig 9 and this mode is attributed to the karst aquifer that is initially full of water the initial fully saturated rock matrix leads to the surface stream overtopping the swallets sediment laden water cannot enter the karst aquifer however the increased free surface of the surface stream associated with the flood wave causes an increased hydraulic head for the aquifer in turn the water flowrate in the cave is increased as is the fluvial shear stress this condition leads to internal fluvial erosion of sediment from the bed of the cave at the spring the hydrograph shows a slight increase in flowrate that is mirrored by the sedigraph and no hysteresis loop occurs the second and third modes of sediment transport reflect the unsteady arrival of sediment from external surface streams and the pre event water storage of the aquifer the surface stream sedigraph shows increasing sediment concentration on the rising limb of the hydrograph and a sharp decline in sediment concentration immediately before the peak water flowrate middle panel fig 9 the hysteresis pattern is a clockwise loop and this is the most commonly occurring hysteresis pattern for relatively undisturbed surface streams hamshaw et al 2018 the surface streams sink to the karst aquifer and carry the sediment laden water sediment pulses are attenuated and extended over longer time durations in the karst aquifer this attenuation and longer duration is seen in fig 4 when comparing surface stream and spring hydrographs and sedigraphs the attenuation and longer duration occurs because the inflow of water exceeds the outflow of water during the event the sediment laden water mixes with clear cave water and the hydraulic conveyance of the aquifer is reduced relative to the surface streams the pre event water storage of the aquifer controls the timing of the water and sediment arrival at the spring and therefore controls the hysteresis patterns the second mode of sediment transport is external sediment transport with counter clockwise hysteresis at the spring middle panel in fig 9 and this mode is attributed to the karst aquifer that is partially full of water initially the aquifer contains unsaturated and saturated matrices sediment laden water enters the aquifer where it pushes a pulse of prior stored clear water out of the aquifer at the same time the hydraulic head of the aquifer increases relatively quickly due to partial water storage causing an increased water flowrate and a peak in the hydrograph the delay of sediment laden water reaching the spring causes a lag in the peak of the sedigraph beyond that of the hydrograph and in turn produces a counter clockwise hysteresis loop the third mode of sediment transport in the karst cave is external sediment transport with clockwise hysteresis bottom panel in fig 9 this mode is attributed to a karst aquifer that is initially very unsaturated an initially unsaturated aquifer causes the sediment concentration peak occur early in the event before the hydrograph peak in time the hydrograph peak does not arrive until the aquifer has become fully saturated to produce a maximum pressure response at the spring so the sediment reaches the spring before the aquifer is fully saturated clear water is pushed out of the cave sediment laden water is transported through the cave to the spring then the aquifer reaches saturation and q peak arrives at the spring in turn the onset of the sediment peak arriving prior to the water flowrate peak causes the clockwise hysteresis loop fig 9 the sediment transport behavior of fig 9 is conceptualized for the karst system of the present study and those karst systems that show similar geomorphology in this study the cave draining the aquifer is always phreatic meaning that the conduit is always filled with water however the overlaying epigenetic aquifer has varying levels of saturation where if the aquifer is fully saturated then the fracture network and rock matrix is filled with water or if it is unsaturated where the fracture network and is not filled with water it is at a lower potentiometric surface the primary cave draining the aquifer is phreatic because there is a downstream control on the cave husic et al 2017a b al aamery et al 2021 phreatic conduits are very common in the karst literature and examples of phreatic cave studies are studied in white 2002 drysdale et al 2001 massei et al 2003 and herman et al 2008 if the cave is not phreatic it is plausible that we have a behavior similar to the surface including the first flush phenomenon picking up sediment on the rising limb of the hydrograph and therefore causing a clockwise hysteresis looping direction in this case we might expected the same commonly occuring clockwise hysteresis as surface streams for the phreatic system as in this study we show that the answer could be either clockwise or counterclockwise and it is really a function of the saturation in the aquifer 4 2 sediment hysteresis in karst we provide comparison of our conceptual model for royal spring fig 9 with a meta analysis for existing datasets from karst springs without already existing tss q hysteresis analysis table 1 the studies listed in the meta analysis were studies that provided tss or turbidity data as well as water flowrate data for karst springs however hysteresis loops were not carried out in these studies and therefore we carried out the hysteresis analyses for comparison sediment concentration or turbidity and water flowrate data were extracted from published datasets for karst springs from germany italy france united states switzerland and romania schiperski et al 2015 drysdale et al 2001 fournier et al 2006 reed et al 2010 luhmann et al 2012 goldscheider et al 2010 herman et al 2008 florea et al 2019 mahler lynch 1999 and hysteresis patterns were quantified using the data distributions see our hysteresis analyses of these datasets in fig s3 results are reported in table 1 and the meta analysis results were that 7 out of 13 results showed counterclockwise hysteresis patterns and 4 out of 13 results show clockwise hysteresis patterns the two events from the karst swiss plateau switzerland showed multiple patterns and loops and investigation of this dataset and the text in the paper showed that the first half of the events showed no hysteresis associated with internal sediment followed by some looping later in the event associated with an externally originating sediment source goldscheider et al 2010 the meta analysis results agree well with royal spring and suggest commonality of counter clockwise hysteresis with high variability resulting from pre event water storage in the aquifers we qualify the small number of storm events in the meta analysis and many papers only presented one storm event of sediment concentration or turbidity data nevertheless 54 of the meta analysis results and 57 of royal spring results 29 events show counter clockwise hysteresis applying the concept models hypothesized in fig 9 the meta analysis suggests externally sourced sediment entering karst aquifers that are partially full of water controls the commonly occurring sediment transport behavior for karst aquifers at the same time the presumed importance of pre event water storage in the aquifers is reasonable with 31 and 15 of events showing clockwise and irregular behavior respectively this compares well with the overall temporal variability of royal spring with 44 of events showing no hysteresis clockwise patterns or irregularity our findings suggest an expanded view of sediment hysteresis for the tss q patterns for phreatic karst systems beyond that of proximal and distal sediment source initiation common to surface stream interpretation e g juez et al 2018 results herein provide evidence that tss q hysteresis patterns of clockwise and counter clockwise behavior in phreatic karst reflect the pre event water storage in the aquifer the external sediment source and its time of initiation can be the same and the hysteresis pattern in the karst system is rather a phenomenon of antecedent water conditions regarding ec tss hysteresis results suggest that clockwise patterns occur as a result of the time varying nature of sediment concentration entering the karst aquifer from sinking streams this interpretation contradicts interpretation of hysteresis patterns adopted in some previous karst studies where researchers suggest resuspension of internal cave sediment causes hysteresis fournier et al 2006 schiperski et al 2015 valdes et al 2006 fournier et al 2006 states that clockwise hysteresis for ec tss is due to resuspension of previously deposited sediment and counter clockwise hysteresis for ec tss is due to deposition of sediment onto the cave floor this interpretation is not consistent with the mechanics of phreatic caves similar to the royal spring system because sediment transport occurs via fluvial erosion one scenario where the interpretation of fournier et al 2006 seems reasonable could be an extensive network of dry cave bottoms with very loose unconsolidated sediment that is resuspended as water makes contact with the sediment this phenomenon will be similar to a first flush in surface dominated watersheds however for phreatic caves that already have sinking streams flowing through them we see no available sediment mechanics to suggest a first flush phenomenon 5 conclusion sediment transport investigation in the karst aquifer suggests potential controls on internal versus external sediment origin and the impact of aquifer saturation on hysteresis twenty percent of events measured at royal spring were characterized by transport of internal cave sediment only which is associated with fully saturated aquifer conditions prior to the event that causes limited external inputs is proportional to fluid shear in the subsurface cave and can be modeled by a modified formulation of the partheniades equation the remaining 80 of events were characterized to include both externally originated and internally resuspended sediment transport of externally sourced sediment caused pulses of sediment through the karst aquifer and prolongs the duration of sediment discharge at the spring the arrival time of sediment pulses is predictable using a metric of the amount of pre event water storage the pre event water storage or aquifer saturation is also suggested to control sediment hysteresis results hysteresis shows a shift from clockwise patterns for the sinking streams to highly variably counter clockwise patterns for the karst spring results suggest that sediment hysteresis at the spring is a function of pre event water storage contrasting interpretations for surface systems that state sediment hysteresis depends on the distribution of proximal to distal sediment sources meta analysis of ten karst springs shows counter clockwise patterns are the most common result found for sediment hysteresis review of the literature suggests that clockwise patterns are more common for surface stream systems whereas the opposite may be true for karst s underground stream systems this difference may be a function of pre event water storage in karst which alters flow pathway connectivity in a way that is not possible

2960,karst springs serve as major drinking water sources for the global population yet there remains uncertainty regarding how contaminants like sediment are routed through karst we find knowledge gaps pertaining to the processes that control the timing and magnitude of sediment delivery to close these knowledge gaps we 1 collected high frequency sediment and conductivity data from three surface streams and two cave sites in the inner bluegrass region of kentucky usa 2 analyzed sediment hysteresis for 51 storm events over a two year period 3 numerically modeled sediment transport through the aquifer and 4 contextualized our results with a meta analysis of ten karst springs in europe and north america our results showed that 80 of storm events derived their sediment from external inputs through sinking streams while the remaining 20 were characterized by only internal resuspension of previously deposited cave sediment we found that internal sediment transport was proportional to fluid shear stress in the cave and occurred exclusively during fully saturated aquifer conditions prior to the storm event during partially saturated aquifer conditions externally sourced sediment pulses were efficiently routed to the spring irrespective of shear in the conduit network sediment hysteresis in surface streams was clockwise whereas the cave sites experienced counter clockwise behavior clockwise and counter clockwise hysteresis typically refer to proximal and distal sourcing for streams but our findings suggest that this interpretation is not valid for subsurface karst settings hysteresis patterns for karst show dependence on the antecedent water conditions in the aquifer and internal versus external sourcing meta analysis results show that despite high variability counter clockwise patterns of sediment hysteresis are very common for karst which contrasts sediment hysteresis in surface streams results suggest that external sediment loading rather than internal resuspension is the most common control of sediment load at springs which should inform management of karst groundwater resources keywords sediment transport karst sediment sources hysteresis antecedent conditions sediment timing data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction twenty five percent of the world s drinking water originates from karst aquifers leibundgut 1998 which are particularly susceptible to contamination due to fast travel times in the subsurface white 2002 we find knowledge gaps regarding the sediment transport processes in karst which limits our ability to accurately formulate predictive equations and understand the timing and source of sediment arriving at karst springs two decades ago white 2002 reported sediment transport in karst as an open topic with many areas that still need to be investigated since that time scientists advanced our understanding of sediment transport in karst aquifers and cave systems with results such as the occurrence of internal erosion of stored sediment in caves and externally sourced sediment transport from sinking streams during storm events herman et al 2008 goldscheider et al 2010 a suite of erosion deposition and transport processes potentially occurring in karst caves herman et al 2008 reed et al 2010 and the control of hydraulic conveyance limits on the sediment transport carrying capacity of the flow husic et al 2017a b however prediction methods and interpretation of hydrologic data remains understudied for sediment transport in karst despite the potential detrimental impacts of sediment on drinking water sediment transport in karst relies on both external and internal processes herman et al 2008 goldscheider et al 2010 external sediment sources can be transported into the subsurface through surficial connections to the karst aquifer which include sinkholes and sinking streams white 2002 the high permeability of karst aquifers defined by fracture networks and cave systems enables this external sediment to transport relatively quickly to karst springs sediment deposits can also occur in caves as the transport capacity of the fluid reduced due to the loss in flow energy from sinking streams entrance husic et al 2017a these sediment deposits become internal sediment that can be resuspended in subsequent hydrologic events dogwiler wicks 2004 reed et al 2010 however the distribution of hydrologic events causing transport of internal and external sediment and the processes controlling their transfer remains an advancement needed for prediction cheng et al 2020 nerantzaki et al 2015 sediment hysteresis is a method to infer sediment sources and transport processes e g williams 1989 hysteresis refers to the asynchronous behavior between two processes such as sediment and discharge and sediment and conductivity as mentioned by a recent literature review by liu et al 2021 the processes and mechanisms behind hysteresis patterns are not fully understood one common inference of sediment concentration versus discharge hysteresis is a clockwise pattern indicates an easily depleted sediment source lying proximal to the measurement point while a counter clockwise pattern suggests a distal source from the measurement point williams 1989 lefrançois et al 2007 eder et al 2010 eludoyin et al 2017 zarnaghsh and husic 2021 recently published a fundamental study uses sediment continuity modelling with experiments and supports the proximal and distal inference for surface streams juez et al 2021 however the process pattern linkage has primarily been applied to surface streams and remains under studied for karst springs sediment concentration versus electrical conductivity hysteresis may also be useful for inferring processes in karst because conductivity is often distinct for surface water and groundwater dahaan et al 2016 clockwise patterns are reported to indicate sediment resuspension in karst caves while counter clockwise patterns indicate sediment deposition fournier et al 2006 schiperski et al 2015 valdes et al 2006 however the linkage of the interpretation to processes has not been carefully examined sediment hysteresis applications and interpretation for karst systems have been generally limited to hysteresis being part of broader objectives to characterize various facets of karst systems lloyd et al 2016 point out that hysteresis results from systems with fractures and caves can be of high complexity but a useful way to provide a cross comparison of different sites and events because karst springs differ so strongly from fluvial streams in their hydrologic controls we hypothesize that the conventional interpretation of hysteresis patterns for karst will differ from that of surface systems the objectives were to 1 gain knowledge of karst sediment transport behavior particularly with respect to internal versus external controls on loading and 2 advance interpretation sediment hysteresis patterns and their inference in karst basins to meet these objectives we analyze of a new dataset from sinking streams and phreatic cave sites for an epigenetic karst basin in the inner bluegrass region of kentucky usa carry out numerical modelling and perform meta analysis of published sediment datasets for karst 2 methods 2 1 study site the study site was the cane run watershed 62 km2 and royal spring karst groundwater basin 58 km2 located in the inner bluegrass region of central kentucky usa the surface stream network of cane run creek which carries water and sediment during storm events is densely packed with over 60 swallets in stream sinkholes along its length husic et al 2017a these swallets partially redirect water and sediment to the subsurface karst system together cane run and royal spring form a surface and sub surface coupled drainage basin with mature karst development a primary cave approximately 5 5 m2 in cross sectional area drains groundwater to royal spring which provides drinking water for the city of georgetown fraley 2019 royal spring is the largest perennial spring in the inner bluegrass region currens et al 2015 this karst cave has been studied by many including husic et al 2017a b and al aamery et al 2021 providing evidence that the aquifer is always phreatic while the overlaying epigenetic aquifer has varying levels of saturation phreatic conduits are very common and have been studied by white 2002 drysdale et al 2001 massei et al 2003 herman et al 2008 and others a description of the soils and geology of the royal spring basin can be found in husic et al 2017a b we chose five sampling locations fig 1 including three surface sites in the cane run creek network and two sites along the primary cave system surface site 1 and surface site 2 drain urban and rural portions respectively of cane run creek surface site 3 is situated at the outlet of upper cane run creek watershed the two cave sites are located in the longitudinal upper section of the cave termed the upstream cave site and at the spring where the cave daylights termed the downstream cave site at royal spring 2 2 data collection and quality control in situ pressure transducers were installed at surface sites 1 2 and 3 to collect water depth data in 10 minute intervals a stage discharge relationship was used to calculate the water flowrate values from the stage height recordings of the pressure transducers husic 2015 at the upstream cave site a pressure transducer was installed in a monitoring well to measure stage and a stage discharge relationship was established using velocity measurements in the conduit deployed temporarily in the well husic 2015 the united states geological survey usgs gage station 032881100 provided flowrate data for the downstream cave site sensor platforms were used measure the turbidity and the electrical conductivity data were collected at the three surface sites and upstream cave site using ysi 6920v2 2 multiparameter water quality sondes connected to campbell scientific cr 20 data loggers at a 10 minute resolution husic 2015 data were collected at the downstream cave site using a ysi 6600v2 multiparameter sonde and a ysi 600 oms v2 optical sonde connected to campbell scientific cr 1000 data logger total suspended sediment tss samples were used to establish relationships with turbidity so that continuous turbidity data could be used as a tss surrogate e g walling et al 2006 tss samples were collected with teledyne isco 6712 automated pump samplers during storm events grab samples were collected at approximately on a weekly basis at all locations the samples were returned to the lab where they were processed through 0 45 µm whatman filters to retain the sediment and used to estimate sediment mass usepa 1999 surrogate relationships between tss and turbidity were established with regression optimized through the data separately for each site cao et al 2021 drysdale et al 2001 quality control of data followed several steps detailed in bettel 2021 and outlined here in brief water flowrate at the spring was corrected using data from the georgetown water treatment plant gwtp to account for their intake located upstream of the usgs gage all instrumentation was checked weekly for power concerns damage by flow events electrical short circuiting or animals chewing on instruments and data were downloaded and batteries switched at that time the sensor probes and connecting cables were cleaned and calibrated following the steps of the manufacturer raw data at the spring were evaluated for erroneous data with the help of the gce data toolbox a software for metadata based processing analysis visualization and transformation of environmental data georgia coastal ecosystems lter n d run in matlab version 2021b the toolbox was applied to evaluate each data point for possible errors that arose during data collection categorization of problems associated with data included invalid data range questionable data not expected to be recorded but are physically possible under certain circumstances percentage for flagging data points for checking with a large change in their value standard deviation flagging to mark outliers in the dataset and missing data points for periods during which the datalogger was not supplied with power during the quality control process monthly data quality reports were completed and are archived in clare 2019 and bettel 2021 2 3 event analyses of data hysteresis and mixing modelling we identified hydrologic storm events for periods during which all three parameters discharge q total suspended solids tss and electric conductivity ec measurements were available fig 1 sampled events highlighted in red events were manually extracted starting at the point at which a pronounced increase in discharge was observed and ending when flow had returned to pre event conditions or when a new event started each event was evaluated for its duration and the magnitude and timing of initial peak and ending values of q tss and ec the parameters were each normalized by creating percentiles using their respective event maxima so that cross site and cross event analyses could be carried out cao et al 2021 fournier et al 2006 lloyd et al 2016 to further facilitate cross event comparison all sites were adjusted to a common time datum corresponding to t 0 when the respective hydrographs reached their maximum flowrate event analyses included data from 25 h before the hydrograph peak to 75 h after the hydrograph peak this event duration allows focus on the important information without omitting any substantial data associated with the precipitation events as events do not typically show pulses in q tss or ec 75 h after the hydrograph peak see fig s1 a few uncharacteristic events did show additional pulses at late time periods in the event and these events were sampled during an in stream construction operation in cane run creek see fig s2 we carried out hysteresis analysis following visual and quantitative methods the tss q and tss ec hysteresis patterns were observed after plotting the normalized data several metrics commonly applied in hysteresis analyses were calculated for each event and then were evaluated separately and cumulatively liu et al 2021 zarnaghsh and husic 2021 tss peak lag time was calculated as 1 ts s lag t max q t max t s s where t max q is the time at which q reaches its maximum flow t max t s s the time at which tss reaches its maximum concentration the hysteresis index was calculated as 2 hi tss i rl tss i fl n where hi is the hysteresis index of normalized discharge tss i rl is the normalized sediment concentration on the rising limb at percentile i tss i fl is the normalized sediment concentration on the falling limb at percentile i and n is the number of percentiles i cao et al 2021 heathwaite bieroza 2020 lloyd et al 2016 the flushing index fi was calculated as 3 fi tss max q tss min q max t s s where tss q max is the total suspended solids concentration at qmax and tss q o is the total suspended solids concentration at the beginning of the event heathwaite bieroza 2020 histograms were plotted for tss lag times hi and fi to investigate distributions and the mode mean variance skewness and kurtosis were calculated and analyzed we performed end member unmixing with ec as the tracer to separate the contribution of water sources in the aquifer from surface derived runoff in the sinking streams and antecedent groundwater in the karst aquifer ec has been deemed fairly conservative for surface and groundwater mixing during storm events massei et al 2003 pellerin et al 2008 the solution is algebraic for two sources and one tracer as 4 ec i t ec i b x i b ec i r x i r a n d 5 x i b x i r 1 where ecb is the conductivity of the baseflow groundwater ecr is the conductivity of the runoff and ect is the total conductivity at timestep i and x indicates the mass fractions the mass fractions use the ratio of volumetric flowrates for incompressible flow as 6 x i b q i b q i t 7 x i r q i r q i t where q i t is the total averaged flow at timestep i q i b is the baseflow at timestep i and q i r is the stormflow at timestep i we carried out hysteresis loops for the unmixed signal including runoff and tss concentrations at each site we plotted q r against the tss concentrations for the 15 minute intervals identified looping direction 2 4 fluvial erosion modelling in the cave we modelled fluid shear stress τ f sediment flux q ss and commonly reported fluvial erosion formula for the cave the analysis was carried out to investigate potential evidence that fluid shear stress in the cave controls sediment flux of internally sourced sediment transported through the cave fluid shear stress was modelled using the darcy weisbach approach as 8 τ f 1 8 f ρ v 2 where the fluid shear stress τ f is in pa f is the darcy weisbach friction factor and is dimensionless ρ is the fluid density kg m 3 and v is the bulk streamwise velocity through the cave m s 1 the friction factor was parameterized for the primary cave of the royal spring groundwater basin in husic et al 2017b and was carried forward herein velocity was estimated every 15 min using the usgs measurements for water flowrate and approximation of the cave s bathymetry the shape of the underground cave was estimated as elliptical based on our previous research of the spring and the elliptical long diameter was estimated as 6 m while the elliptical short diameter was 0 9 m this estimate is based on a great deal of historic research of the cave bathymetry over the past 40 years by the kentucky geological survey kgs and researchers at the university of kentucky dye tracers were used to find connectivity of the cave system across the extent as well as travel time for different hydrologic conditions within the cave by spangler 1982 taylor 1992 and paylor and currens 2004 thrailkill and gouzie 1984 investigated linear velocity cave geometry and conveyance in the conduit and tripathi 2009 used electrical resistivity to determine the footprint of the cave the kgs used down hole images in combination with doppler sonar instruments to determine the approximate geometry of the conduit husic 2015 the combined results of the mentioned methods made it possible to estimate the general shape of the cave which was estimated as an elliptical conduit i e an average short diameter in the vertical direction of 0 9 m and an average long diameter in the transverse direction of 6 2 m husic 2015 husic et al 2017a b sediment flux was estimated every 15 min using the sediment sensor and water flowrate measurements the potential of the fluvial erosion process controlling erosion of internal sediment in the cave and in turn controlling sediment flux was assessed using the fluvial erosion formula of partheniades the partheniades equation is a widely used erosion and resuspension formula for cohesive sediment and is given as 9 ε a eff k d τ f τ c m where ε is the sediment flux via the fluvial erosion process g s a eff is a supply term defined as the effective area of the cave bed supplying sediment k d is the erodibility coefficient τ c is the critical shear stress pa and m is the erodibility exponent and is near 1 the erodibility coefficient was parameterized as a function of τ c following the work of hanson and simon 2001 the effective area reflects the concept that some portions of the cave bed are covered with fluvial sediment and other portions of the bed are bedrock with no available fluvial sediment in this way the potential to adjust a eff for different conditions was investigated 2 5 numerical modelling of sediment pulses in the karst aquifer numerical modelling using the conservation of mass for water and sediment was carried out to simulate the effect of an externally sourced sediment pulse that enters the subsurface and transports through the aquifer and cave system during a storm event a sediment pulse from the sinking streams was input using the sediment concentration data water and sediment routing through the upper aquifer was accomplished via a reservoir model approach for the system e g husic et al 2019 routing through the cave system was accomplished by discretizing the cave and treating the system as pipeflow e g husic et al 2017b al aamery et al 2021 the model was formulated for the karst aquifer as a reservoir and the cave system as 10 d s res dt q sw q gw q cave i n 11 d tss res s res dt tss sw q sw tss gw q gw tss cave q cave i n 12 d s cave dt q cave i n q cave o u t a n d 13 d tss cave s cave dt tss cave i n q cave i n tss cave o u t q cave o u t the first two equations were setup for the karst aquifer reservoir that is modelled as an unsteady flow detention basin and the second two equations are for the phreatic that is modelled as pipeflow s and tss indicate water storage m3 and sediment concentration g l 1 and subscripts sw gw cave in and cave out indicate swallet water from the sinking streams groundwater recharge from the fracture flow and phreatic matrix draining the soil and epikarst cave water inputs and cave outputs respectively parameterization of model fluxes and model discretization was accomplished using commonly applied karst reservoir routing formula and conduit approaches hartmann et al 2014 husic et al 2017b 2019 a reservoir approach was applied to both the exit from the karst aquifer to the cave and the groundwater recharge from fractures and the rock matrix as 14 q α s res β where α and β are reservoir coefficients the storage in the karst aquifer was treated as the product of the reservoir depth and effective area sres hresaeff a constant value was applied for the sinking streams net water flowrate recharging the karst aquifer via the swallets and this input was adjusted to zero when the karst aquifer was saturated these assumptions are reasonable given the 50 plus swallets for which subsequent filling and overtopping has been observed in the creek system the equations were discretized in time and one reservoir was used for the system following the work of husic et al 2019 and five cave segments were modelled the unsteady terms were set to zero in the cave since the cave is always phreatic and therefore the water flowrate at the spring was useful to set initial conditions for the karst aquifer coefficients of the reservoir fluxes the effective area of the aquifer were adjusted to agree with mean water flow rate conditions at the cave s spring sediment concentration from the sinking streams entering the aquifer via swallets was set to match the surface stream sediment concentration mean distribution given the relative similarities across events sediment deposition and erosion in the cave were assumed to be equal in amount and therefore were not included in the simulations so that we could isolate impacts of mixing the sediment laden surface derived water with the clear water groundwater in the aquifer and observe the constraint on water discharge in the cave that slows the transport velocity 3 results 3 1 internal and external sources of sediment during events results from data collection at royal spring produced 51 individual hydrologic events with coinciding turbidity and conductivity data fig 1 despite hydrograph responses at the spring 10 events had no pronounced pulses of tss or ec and two events showed irregular behavior and were difficult to interpret fig 2 the remaining 39 events showed pronounced tss and ec pulses in temporal proximity to q peaks fig 2 close examination of the 10 sedigraphs with no observable pulses showed tss experienced a slight increase and then decreased with the rising and falling limb of the hydrograph fig 2 however this dependence was very low in comparison to other 39 events that exhibited a noticeable sediment pulse the sediment pulses occurred in conjunction with the hydrograph response albeit at times out of phase with q and included a steep incline in tss peaking which was then followed by a decrease to pre event tss conditions we examined factors controlling the presence or absence of sediment pulses observed at the spring for the 39 and 10 events respectively the peak water flowrate for each event as measured at the spring showed no significance as a factor controlling the classification of events as showing the presence or absence of the sediment pulses p value 0 21 two tail t test assuming unequal variances however the hydrograph range qrange clustered to two types of event and significantly controlled classification of the events as showing the presence or absence of sediment pulses p value 0 005 qrange is defined as the difference between the peak water flowrate and the pre event flowrate for each individual event eight of the 10 events with no tss and ec pulse had a qrange less than 0 5 cms while 32 out of 39 events with tss and ec pulse had a qrange greater than 0 5 cms the clustering metric is not absolute but qrange does separate 82 of the events and suggests an underlying hydrologic process we attribute the absence of pulses in the sedigraphs and chemographs fig 2 left column to saturated conditions for the karst aquifer at the start of the event a pre event condition of saturated aquifer prevents externally sourced sediment transported into the aquifer by preventing high tss runoff water from entering the cave the surface streams overtop the swallet openings and in turn a relatively small increase in water flowrate is observed at the spring i e 0 5 cms increase in q at royal spring this interpretation is consistent with the ec distribution on the other hand the presence of pulses in the sedigraphs and chemographs fig 2 right column provide evidence that externally sourced sediment has entered the cave events with the presence of an ec pulse show a sharp decrease of ec consistent with recharge from the surface streams to the karst aquifer the results suggest that only sediment internal to the karst cave was transported during events with no tss or ec pulse while both internal and externally derived sediment was transported to royal spring during events with tss and ec pulses fluvial erosion modelling results for the cave supported the separation of the 10 events with no tss and ec pulses and 39 events with pulses as internal sediment only and combined internal external sediment respectively fig 3 sediment flux estimated from the measured data qss is plotted as a function of fluid shear stress in the cave τf for the 10 events with no tss and ec pulse fig 3a and for data from a sample of events with pulses fig 3b sediment flux shows a direct dependence on fluid shear stress in the cave for the events with no tss and ec pulses we interpret this result to reflect the process of fluvial erosion in the cave in which fluid shear stress at the floor of the cave causes internal sediment transport sediment flux shows a dependence on fluid shear stress in the cave for some of the data collected for events with pulses however the majority show clustering and scattered behavior with no clear dependence on shear stress in the cave we interpret this result to reflect mixed processes of fluvial erosion in the cave and sediment influx to the cave through swallets from the sinking streams indicating both internal and externally sourced sediment transport we plot the fluvial erosion formula modified from partheniades via the work for silt sized sediment by hanson and simon 2001 the fluvial erosion formula was optimized well for data from events that showed no pulses in fig 3a however much of the data in fig 3b does not agree with the fluvial erosion formula owing to the interpretation that this is externally originated sediment that moves through the system as a pulse of sediment 3 2 time series results time series results for events with sediment pulses showed a shift in behavior longitudinally in the basin from surface sites to royal spring indicating increased water and sediment retention the longitudinal trends are seen when observing hydrographs q versus time sedigraphs tss versus time and chemographs ec versus time data from the cane run streams the upper cave site and downstream cave site at royal spring fig 4 the mean distributions dashed black lines in fig 4 a e show the base of the hydrograph widens reflecting increased residence time of surface derived runoff and in turn longer duration events moving from upstream to downstream the time series at surface site 1 shows the sharpest hydrograph peak and the narrowest base followed by surface site 2 surface site 3 upstream cave site and with the widest base the downstream cave site for the surface streams the shifts are expected because of an increase in drainage area across the three locations for the cave the longer duration hydrographs and sedigraphs reflect an increase in water and sediment retention time with some events showing the cave hydrographs extending an order of magnitude longer than the duration of hydrographs in the surface streams the water velocity in the cave is on average 16 of the water velocity in the surface streams this result agrees with water conveyance estimates in the karst aquifer and conveyance is greatly reduced in the cave relative to the surface streams because the cave experiences pipeflow mechanics and thus is limited in its cross section al aamery et al 2021 sediment concentration and electrical conductivity time series results from the cave sites point toward externally sourced sediment and water the sedigraphs and chemographs show consistent pulses during the events the mean sedigraph pulses at each site dashed black lines in fig 4 f j had a general inverse agreement with the mean chemograph pulses dashed black lines in fig 4 k o the surface sites show primary sediment pulses attributed to surface erosion and sediment transport as runoff is generated surface sites 2 and 3 show secondary pulses attributed to streambank erosion in the main corridor as these sites show the greater height of streambanks and experienced degradation the past decade bettel 2021 the chemographs show pronounced negative pulses at surface sites consistent with the observation that ec of runoff in surface streams is typically considerably lower than that of groundwater e g dahaan et al 2016 these transfers of water and sediment to the subsurface karst are visually evident as primary pulses are observable although elongated in duration due to the previously mentioned increase in residence time instantaneous sedigraph results at royal spring colored lines in fig 4j showed examples of observed primary and secondary pulses attributed to surface and bank erosion transferred from the sinking streams 3 3 tss q hysteresis results of hysteresis patterns and metrics for sediment concentration as a function of water flowrate tss q hysteresis show a shift in behavior from clockwise patterns for the surface stream to figure eight at the upstream cave site to counter clockwise patterns and very high variability at royal spring see mean loops and instantaneous loops in fig 5 out of the 39 events that showed tss and ec pulses visually 19 were clearly counter clockwise 0 were clearly clockwise 5 events were a figure eight pattern showing clockwise and counter clockwise loops 9 events appeared linear and 6 events showed complex patterns that were difficult to summarize of the 39 events 29 events showed a positive tsslag indicating more counter clockwise behavior 8 events showed a negative tsslag indicating clockwise hysteresis and two events showed a tsslag equal to zero indicating linear behavior the mode of the tsslag shifts from 5 h to 5 h for surface streams to the cave indicating a shift to counter clockwise behavior at royal spring fig 6 the central mode of the hysteresis index hi shifts from 0 3 for surface stream sites to 0 15 at the upstream cave site to 0 15 at royal spring where a negative hi indicates counter clockwise the central mode for the flushing index shifts from 0 85 for the surface stream sites to 0 6 for the upstream cave site to 0 2 at royal spring the flushing index indicates the system shifts from an almost exclusive concentration response at the surface to a mixed concentration and dilution response at royal spring variability of hysteresis shows that hi ranges from 0 4 to 0 3 at royal spring demonstrating that various degrees of counter clockwise and clockwise patterns that reflect the varying arrivals of tss pulses surface streams are reported to most often show clockwise patterns for tss q hysteresis hamshaw et al 2018 cao et al 2021 and our results in the cane run stream network agrees with this result clockwise hysteresis patterns are typically interpreted as erosion of proximal close by sediment sources that are easily transported during a hydrologic event cao et al 2021 in surface streams the clockwise pattern is common because the sediment sources are close to the measurement location of the instrument causing the sediment peak to occur early in the event before the hydrograph peak lloyd et al 2016 this interpretation is reasonable for the surface streams of cane run creek because the primary sediment source is stored sediment in the ephemeral network which is entrained during the rising limb of the hydrograph the shift to commonly shown counter clockwise pattern with high variability for tss q hysteresis at karst spring are unique results to the literature and counter clockwise patterns are less commonly reported for sediment hysteresis hamshaw et al 2018 krajewski et al 2018 lloyd et al 2016 although some work has shown that intense urbanization pushes streams toward counter clockwise behavior zarnaghsh and husic 2021 the common interpretation of counter clockwise patterns for tss q hysteresis is dominance of sediment transport from distal far away sediment sources that are not well connected to the measurement location of the instrument juez et al 2018 zarnaghsh and husic 2021 however this interpretation may not hold for sediment hysteresis in karst caves the hysteresis in the cave varies between clockwise and counter clockwise depending on events with net counter clockwise behavior this behavior is likely a function of pre event water storage in the karst aquifer numerical modeling results and comparison with data support the dependence of counter clockwise and clockwise hysteresis on the pre event water storage in the aquifer the data and numerical modeling results show that the modelled variation of the tsslag as a function of the time for the rising limb of the hydrograph trl in which the latter can be used as a surrogate to determine pre event water storage conditions within the aquifer fig 7 a b high trl occurs because the aquifer is initially unsaturated and takes a long time to fill while low trl occurs because the aquifer is initially near saturation and takes a shorter time to fill the saturation state of the aquifer as a function of the rising limb time is illustrated in fig 7 when simulated as initially unsaturated i e near empty fig 7c the aquifer takes approximately 60 h to fill with water and for the water flowrate to reach its peak flow i e time for rising limb trl when simulated as initially saturated i e near full fig 7d the aquifer takes approximately 10 h to fill with water and for the water flowrate to reach its peak flow i e time for rising limb trl this result is consistent with conceptualizing the karst aquifer as a reservoir with the primary phreatic cave as the reservoir outlet the consistent behavior of the saturation states on sediment transport was also shown via the modelling i e fig 7 sediment results storm events with an initially saturated aquifer and thus short trl have longer and net positive tsslag times while events with an initially unsaturated karst aquifer show long trl and negative tsslag times this concept can be seen visually in time series results from the numerical model of fig 7c where sediment transport occurs for an event with an initially unsaturated karst aquifer the tss peak occurs before the hydrograph peak similar to a surface stream fig 7d shows the modeling results for an event with an initially saturated aquifer the sediment peak response is delayed due to the transport of clear water to the spring and pressure response of the system for the nine data points on the top shown in fig 7a we qualify that there is no visual dependence of tsslag on trl these events occurred during the months from february to september 2018 when stream restoration contractors were restoring an approximately 1 6 km reach of the streambanks in the upper portion of the cane run creek this restoration activity intersected with the rain events of springtime 2018 which was the wettest year on the 150 year precipitation record from 1870 to 2020 bettel 2021 the very high tsslag values are attributed to streambank erosion on the falling limb of the surface hydrographs during this time period fig 4j bettel 2021 results suggest the tss q hysteresis for the karst cave is a function of the pre event water storage of the aquifer this contradicts the idea that the system shifts from proximal to distal sources royal spring shows both counter clockwise and clockwise behavior for different events fig 6 and both patterns reflect the same external source of sediment from the sinking streams that is transported through the cave the arrival of the sediment pulse is interpreted as a function of the initial water storage in the aquifer as opposed to the spatial location of the source an aquifer that is initially unsaturated or dry will show arrival of the tss pulse prior to qpeak and exhibit clockwise behavior similar to a surface stream an aquifer that is nearly saturated will show a tss pulse after qpeak and exhibit counter clockwise behavior because the pressure response of the pre stored clear aquifer water arrives at the spring prior to the tss pulse 3 4 tss ec hysteresis results results of sediment concentration and electrical conductivity tss ec hysteresis provide evidence about the sources of water and sediment in the surface streams and the cave clockwise tss ec hysteresis loops occurred for all sites including the cave and spring sites fig 8 a e the main mode of sediment transport is from runoff water that arrives at each site causing the ec values to drop as well as the tss values increase we also used mixing analyses for water sources and carry out hysteresis and the hysteresis analyses of tss and surface runoff support the tss ec hysteresis interpretation the general trend from the upstream surface sites to the downstream cave site is that as the sites move further down and the amount of runoff qr at the total hydrograph qt peak decreases this trend is observed for the runoff qr contribution at the tss peak time the further downstream in the cave the site is located the less runoff is contributing to the total flow at the time the tss peak occurs regardless the tss qrunoff hysteresis loops are consistently clockwise patterns and agree with the tss ec results the tss ec hysteresis is valuable because it isolates the water s runoff origin and relationship to the sediment results provide evidence that all sediment pulse are from the same source external sediment that transports to the subsurface karst from the sinking streams in this manner the tss ec hysteresis removes the effect of the pre event storage of water in the karst aquifer and shows that sediment is not distal or proximal in all cases the tss peak occurs before the ec peak because the tss pulse occurs during the rising limb of the runoff hydrograph as entrainment occurs at the surface 4 discussion 4 1 sediment transport in karst results lead to a conceptual model for behavior of sediment transport in the phreatic karst system and interpretation of hysteresis patterns fig 9 three modes of sediment transport behavior in the karst cave are conceptualized including 1 internal sediment transport with no hysteresis at the spring 2 externally sourced sediment transport with counter clockwise hysteresis and 3 externally sourced sediment transport with clockwise hysteresis all three modes of sediment transport are hypothesized to be a function of initial water storage in the karst aquifer as indicated with saturated and unsaturated rock matrices these aquifer conditions include initially saturated initially partially saturated and nearly empty of water initially the unsteady sediment arrival to the aquifer also controls externally sourced sediment transport in modes two and three the first mode of sediment transport in the karst cave is internal sediment transport only with no hysteresis at the spring top panel in fig 9 and this mode is attributed to the karst aquifer that is initially full of water the initial fully saturated rock matrix leads to the surface stream overtopping the swallets sediment laden water cannot enter the karst aquifer however the increased free surface of the surface stream associated with the flood wave causes an increased hydraulic head for the aquifer in turn the water flowrate in the cave is increased as is the fluvial shear stress this condition leads to internal fluvial erosion of sediment from the bed of the cave at the spring the hydrograph shows a slight increase in flowrate that is mirrored by the sedigraph and no hysteresis loop occurs the second and third modes of sediment transport reflect the unsteady arrival of sediment from external surface streams and the pre event water storage of the aquifer the surface stream sedigraph shows increasing sediment concentration on the rising limb of the hydrograph and a sharp decline in sediment concentration immediately before the peak water flowrate middle panel fig 9 the hysteresis pattern is a clockwise loop and this is the most commonly occurring hysteresis pattern for relatively undisturbed surface streams hamshaw et al 2018 the surface streams sink to the karst aquifer and carry the sediment laden water sediment pulses are attenuated and extended over longer time durations in the karst aquifer this attenuation and longer duration is seen in fig 4 when comparing surface stream and spring hydrographs and sedigraphs the attenuation and longer duration occurs because the inflow of water exceeds the outflow of water during the event the sediment laden water mixes with clear cave water and the hydraulic conveyance of the aquifer is reduced relative to the surface streams the pre event water storage of the aquifer controls the timing of the water and sediment arrival at the spring and therefore controls the hysteresis patterns the second mode of sediment transport is external sediment transport with counter clockwise hysteresis at the spring middle panel in fig 9 and this mode is attributed to the karst aquifer that is partially full of water initially the aquifer contains unsaturated and saturated matrices sediment laden water enters the aquifer where it pushes a pulse of prior stored clear water out of the aquifer at the same time the hydraulic head of the aquifer increases relatively quickly due to partial water storage causing an increased water flowrate and a peak in the hydrograph the delay of sediment laden water reaching the spring causes a lag in the peak of the sedigraph beyond that of the hydrograph and in turn produces a counter clockwise hysteresis loop the third mode of sediment transport in the karst cave is external sediment transport with clockwise hysteresis bottom panel in fig 9 this mode is attributed to a karst aquifer that is initially very unsaturated an initially unsaturated aquifer causes the sediment concentration peak occur early in the event before the hydrograph peak in time the hydrograph peak does not arrive until the aquifer has become fully saturated to produce a maximum pressure response at the spring so the sediment reaches the spring before the aquifer is fully saturated clear water is pushed out of the cave sediment laden water is transported through the cave to the spring then the aquifer reaches saturation and q peak arrives at the spring in turn the onset of the sediment peak arriving prior to the water flowrate peak causes the clockwise hysteresis loop fig 9 the sediment transport behavior of fig 9 is conceptualized for the karst system of the present study and those karst systems that show similar geomorphology in this study the cave draining the aquifer is always phreatic meaning that the conduit is always filled with water however the overlaying epigenetic aquifer has varying levels of saturation where if the aquifer is fully saturated then the fracture network and rock matrix is filled with water or if it is unsaturated where the fracture network and is not filled with water it is at a lower potentiometric surface the primary cave draining the aquifer is phreatic because there is a downstream control on the cave husic et al 2017a b al aamery et al 2021 phreatic conduits are very common in the karst literature and examples of phreatic cave studies are studied in white 2002 drysdale et al 2001 massei et al 2003 and herman et al 2008 if the cave is not phreatic it is plausible that we have a behavior similar to the surface including the first flush phenomenon picking up sediment on the rising limb of the hydrograph and therefore causing a clockwise hysteresis looping direction in this case we might expected the same commonly occuring clockwise hysteresis as surface streams for the phreatic system as in this study we show that the answer could be either clockwise or counterclockwise and it is really a function of the saturation in the aquifer 4 2 sediment hysteresis in karst we provide comparison of our conceptual model for royal spring fig 9 with a meta analysis for existing datasets from karst springs without already existing tss q hysteresis analysis table 1 the studies listed in the meta analysis were studies that provided tss or turbidity data as well as water flowrate data for karst springs however hysteresis loops were not carried out in these studies and therefore we carried out the hysteresis analyses for comparison sediment concentration or turbidity and water flowrate data were extracted from published datasets for karst springs from germany italy france united states switzerland and romania schiperski et al 2015 drysdale et al 2001 fournier et al 2006 reed et al 2010 luhmann et al 2012 goldscheider et al 2010 herman et al 2008 florea et al 2019 mahler lynch 1999 and hysteresis patterns were quantified using the data distributions see our hysteresis analyses of these datasets in fig s3 results are reported in table 1 and the meta analysis results were that 7 out of 13 results showed counterclockwise hysteresis patterns and 4 out of 13 results show clockwise hysteresis patterns the two events from the karst swiss plateau switzerland showed multiple patterns and loops and investigation of this dataset and the text in the paper showed that the first half of the events showed no hysteresis associated with internal sediment followed by some looping later in the event associated with an externally originating sediment source goldscheider et al 2010 the meta analysis results agree well with royal spring and suggest commonality of counter clockwise hysteresis with high variability resulting from pre event water storage in the aquifers we qualify the small number of storm events in the meta analysis and many papers only presented one storm event of sediment concentration or turbidity data nevertheless 54 of the meta analysis results and 57 of royal spring results 29 events show counter clockwise hysteresis applying the concept models hypothesized in fig 9 the meta analysis suggests externally sourced sediment entering karst aquifers that are partially full of water controls the commonly occurring sediment transport behavior for karst aquifers at the same time the presumed importance of pre event water storage in the aquifers is reasonable with 31 and 15 of events showing clockwise and irregular behavior respectively this compares well with the overall temporal variability of royal spring with 44 of events showing no hysteresis clockwise patterns or irregularity our findings suggest an expanded view of sediment hysteresis for the tss q patterns for phreatic karst systems beyond that of proximal and distal sediment source initiation common to surface stream interpretation e g juez et al 2018 results herein provide evidence that tss q hysteresis patterns of clockwise and counter clockwise behavior in phreatic karst reflect the pre event water storage in the aquifer the external sediment source and its time of initiation can be the same and the hysteresis pattern in the karst system is rather a phenomenon of antecedent water conditions regarding ec tss hysteresis results suggest that clockwise patterns occur as a result of the time varying nature of sediment concentration entering the karst aquifer from sinking streams this interpretation contradicts interpretation of hysteresis patterns adopted in some previous karst studies where researchers suggest resuspension of internal cave sediment causes hysteresis fournier et al 2006 schiperski et al 2015 valdes et al 2006 fournier et al 2006 states that clockwise hysteresis for ec tss is due to resuspension of previously deposited sediment and counter clockwise hysteresis for ec tss is due to deposition of sediment onto the cave floor this interpretation is not consistent with the mechanics of phreatic caves similar to the royal spring system because sediment transport occurs via fluvial erosion one scenario where the interpretation of fournier et al 2006 seems reasonable could be an extensive network of dry cave bottoms with very loose unconsolidated sediment that is resuspended as water makes contact with the sediment this phenomenon will be similar to a first flush in surface dominated watersheds however for phreatic caves that already have sinking streams flowing through them we see no available sediment mechanics to suggest a first flush phenomenon 5 conclusion sediment transport investigation in the karst aquifer suggests potential controls on internal versus external sediment origin and the impact of aquifer saturation on hysteresis twenty percent of events measured at royal spring were characterized by transport of internal cave sediment only which is associated with fully saturated aquifer conditions prior to the event that causes limited external inputs is proportional to fluid shear in the subsurface cave and can be modeled by a modified formulation of the partheniades equation the remaining 80 of events were characterized to include both externally originated and internally resuspended sediment transport of externally sourced sediment caused pulses of sediment through the karst aquifer and prolongs the duration of sediment discharge at the spring the arrival time of sediment pulses is predictable using a metric of the amount of pre event water storage the pre event water storage or aquifer saturation is also suggested to control sediment hysteresis results hysteresis shows a shift from clockwise patterns for the sinking streams to highly variably counter clockwise patterns for the karst spring results suggest that sediment hysteresis at the spring is a function of pre event water storage contrasting interpretations for surface systems that state sediment hysteresis depends on the distribution of proximal to distal sediment sources meta analysis of ten karst springs shows counter clockwise patterns are the most common result found for sediment hysteresis review of the literature suggests that clockwise patterns are more common for surface stream systems whereas the opposite may be true for karst s underground stream systems this difference may be a function of pre event water storage in karst which alters flow pathway connectivity in a way that is not possible

2961,low impact development lid facilities are the key to realizing the source control of stormwater however there are few studies on the control effects of different lid facilities on runoff volume and runoff quality in this paper based on the storm water management model swmm a monte carlo method was used to simulate the runoff process for five lid facilities the correlation analysis and scoring of the three indicators of runoff coefficient peak runoff and suspended solid ss wash off in the simulation results were conducted to evaluate the control effects of different lid facilities the simulation results showed an evident law of decreasing marginal effect in the deployed area of lid facilities in addition the uncertainty of the hydrological response of permeable pavement is the smallest among the five types of lid facilities and the uncertainty of vegetative swales is the largest under the suitable combination of parameters the area percentage of permeable pavement reaching the upper limit of the control effect of three indicators is the smallest the control effect of three indicators of infiltration trench is the best correlation analysis showed that the three indicators of the lid facilities could be estimated from each other through the regression relationship equation keywords low impact development storm water management model unit plot monte carlo runoff impact data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction with the rapid development of global urbanization the proportion of underlying permeable surfaces in urban areas has significantly decreased resulting in reduced interception ability and poor infiltration of urban rainwater locatelli et al 2017 sutton et al 2009 it also leads to the advance of peak runoff and increased runoff li et al 2018 moreover it is a common cause of waterlogging huong and pathirana 2011 at the same time rainfall and runoff usually deteriorate the water environment due to the lack of control over the pollution of urban non point sources and combined sewer overflow cso mailhot et al 2015 to mitigate the adverse hydrological effects of urban development the united states proposed the low impact development lid concept for rainwater control at the end of the twentieth century dietz 2007 this concept aims to reduce runoff volume and runoff pollution by controlling rainwater at the source of runoff by using small scale and decentralized facilities for infiltration and retention similar concepts of rainwater control include the sustainable urban drainage system suds in the united kingdom ferrans et al 2022 low impact urban design and development liudd in new zealand roon 2011 water sensitive urban design wsud in australia morison and brown 2011 and sponge city sc in china li et al 2017 through source control lid facilities can enable multi objective stormwater control such as runoff pollution runoff volume and peak runoff conventional lid facilities mainly include green roofs gr rain gardens rg vegetative swales vs bio retention cells brc rain barrels rb and permeable pavement pp in recent years several researchers have studied the hydrological control effects of these facilities through models and experiments in terms of peak runoff and total runoff volume sin et al 2014 and liu et al 2015a analyzed the roles of lid facilities in delaying the peak time of runoff and reducing the runoff volume based on the simulation of hydrological models swmm storm water management model and l thia lid hou et al 2020 and tirpak et al 2021 analyzed the water retention capability of rain gardens bio retention cells and permeable pavements by conducting long term hydrological monitoring of the study area harper et al 2015 conducted simulated rainfall experiments on green and concrete roof installations and found that green roofs can reduce runoff by 40 60 by calculating the effectiveness of stormwater control in several cities in the united states and europe that were retrofitted with lid facilities wang et al 2009 found that lid facilities can reduce stormwater runoff by 30 to 99 and delay the peak of stormwater runoff by 5 to 20 min zhu et al 2019 simulated the runoff process of permeable pavement under different rainfall return periods the results show that permeable pavement can reduce surface runoff by 50 95 and delay the flood peak time in addition lid facilities are also effective in removing runoff pollutants fan et al 2022 for suspended solids ss liu et al 2019 monitored the control effect of permeable pavements in several locations in shanghai and found that the removal rate of ss by permeable pavements ranged from 50 to 85 yin et al 2019 found that the removal rate of event mean concentration emc of ss for three types of green roofs ranged from 52 5 to 65 9 by monitoring natural rainfall over a long calendar period and artificially simulated rainfall experiments in addition many studies have verified that lid facilities can effectively remove nitrogen and phosphorus pollutants from runoff bing zheng et al 2013 kong et al 2021 taghizadeh et al 2021 stormwater problems vary from city to city due to many factors such as climatic conditions underlying surface types landforms and soils as a technical measure that can mitigate various stormwater problems baek et al 2015 lid facilities are widely used because of the advantages of a small footprint and low cost in recent years more studies have used swmm primarily to analyze the effects of hydrological control of lid facilities akter et al 2020 baek et al 2020 cipolla et al 2016 heidari et al 2022 however as the actual control effect of lid on runoff is affected by regional factors such as rainfall topography land use and soil there are few comparisons between lid facilities in different studies therefore this paper conducted stochastic simulations based on the swmm to compare the hydrological control effects of lid facilities under different parameter combinations and conducted correlation analyses for three indicators runoff coefficient peak runoff and ss wash off the queuing scoring method evaluated the hydrological control effects of lid facilities this study can provide a reference for the scientific selection of lid facilities 2 materials and methods 2 1 lid module in swmm the swmm is a rainfall runoff model proposed by the us environmental protection agency in the early 1970s gironás et al 2010 and has been widely used babaei et al 2018 rong et al 2021 zeng et al 2021 since version 5 1 013 the swmm has added the simulation function of lid facilities including eight conventional lid facilities biological retention cells rain gardens green roofs permeable pavements infiltration trenches rain barrels rooftop disconnections and vegetative swales wen liang et al 2012 in swmm lid facilities consisted of different component layers such as surface pavement soil storage and drain the specific component layers of different lid facilities are shown in table 1 the drain layer plays a role in conveying the runoff to the municipal pipeline network to reduce the uncertainty arising from the connection of lid facilities to the pipeline network the influence of the drain layer was not considered in this study 2 2 scenario settings to minimize the interference of other factors the sub catchment in the model is set as a square unit plot with a slope of 0 003 an area of 100 ha and imperviousness of 50 parameter settings for a unit plot refer to urban china geographic data a et al 2015 ai bing et al 2015 tang et al 2020 this type is representative of most plain cities in general arnold and gibbons 1996 brezonik and stadelmann 2002 to avoid the influence of the pipeline network on the lid control effect no drainage pipes are arranged on the unit plot the horton model is used to simulate the process of surface runoff infiltration and the runoff calculation method is dynamic wave the pollutant accumulation on the ground is according to the sat method with a maximum accumulation of 270 kg ha the parameter values of the unit plot are set as shown in table 2 in this study a plain city in northern china is used as an example with the design return period of rainfall being set to one year and the rainfall duration being set to one hour the distribution of typical rainfall time series is shown in fig 1 2 3 model simulation 2 3 1 monte carlo stochastic method the monte carlo stochastic method obtains multiple sets of parameters or combinations of variables by random sampling methods it simulates each set of numerical variables separately to get many outputs for statistical analysis which is usually used to analyze the uncertainty of hydrological models jeremiah et al 2012 liu et al 2015b turgut et al 2021 in this study each type of lid facility was simulated 10 000 times according to the range of values of input parameters of lid facilities in the model manual the parameters were randomly sampled modified by matlab program scripts and completed the swmm simulations the results of multiple simulations for each type of facility were statistically analyzed regarding the guidance on promoting sponge city construction issued by the general office of the state council of the people s republic of china runoff coefficient peak runoff and pollutant flushing were selected as evaluation indicators of the lid control effect ss wash off is selected as the analysis object for pollutant flushing as an essential carrier of urban runoff pollution ss adsorbs various insoluble organic and inorganic substances sediment and microorganisms so it correlates well with cod tn tp and other common runoff pollutant indicators zhao et al 2015 2 3 2 lid facility parameters in the manual for the swmm the value range of each parameter is given for example the parameter thickness in the soil layer which describes the thickness of the soil layer is 450 900 mm for rain gardens and bio retention cells so in the random sampling of this parameter in this study the upper limit was set to 900 mm the lower limit was set to 450 mm and the sampling distribution was chosen to be uniform regarding pollutant flushing the swmm manual gives the emc event mean concentrations parameters for tss total suspended solid in the range of 180 548 mg l the range of parameter values for different lid facilities is shown in table 3 2 4 queuing score for lid facility effect the queuing scoring method is widely used due to its simplicity and ease of implementation fei yan et al 2014 zhang et al 2021 the indicators were ranked according to their strengths and weaknesses for the three indicators of runoff coefficient peak runoff and ss wash off in the simulation results positive indicators are ranked from most significant to most minor and negative indicators are ranked from smallest to largest the first ranked indicator corresponds to 100 points the last ranked indicator corresponds to 0 points and the rest of the scores are calculated according to the following formula 1 x 100 n 1 n 1 100 where x is the score of queuing for the actual value of an indicator n is the total number of simulation results participating in queuing and n is the ranking of the actual value of the indicator the frequency of the actual value of each indicator is counted and the actual value of all indicators in the queue is multiplied by the corresponding frequency of occurrence the expected value of the indicator is obtained by summing up the multiplied results in this study when the strengths and weaknesses of indicators in different parameter combinations are the same the area ratio is used as their scoring criteria the smaller the floor area of the lid facility under the same indicator merit condition the higher the score of that parameter combination because of the large number of parameter combinations involved in scoring the scoring process would be too cumbersome if all indicators of each combination were scored to simplify the scoring process and reduce the number of calculations all parameter combinations are divided into ranges according to the degree of superiority and inferiority of the indicators and the size of area ratio 3 results and discussion 3 1 uncertainty analysis of different lid facilities vegetative swales vs infiltration trenches it bio retention cells brc permeable pavements pp and rain gardens rg are typical lid facilities that can accept water from upstream vegetative swales and infiltration trenches carry the role of diversion in contrast bio retention cells permeable pavements and rain gardens care for detention and water storage according to the monte carlo simulation results the control effect of each type of lid facility on hydrology with different combinations of parameters can be seen as shown in fig 2 each point in the scatter plot represents a simulation result the uncertainty of the hydrological response of the vegetative swales increased with the area at an area ratio of 5 the variation of the runoff coefficient per unit plot ranges from 0 3 to 0 4 when the area ratio increased to 10 the runoff coefficient per unit plot variation increased to between 0 25 and 0 4 moreover the peak runoff and ss wash off had similar effects which indicated that the selection of parameter combinations significantly impacted the lid facility s hydrologic response even within the conventional parameter range in the it simulation results the uncertainty of the simulation increases first and then decreases when the it area ratio is less than 3 5 the simulated uncertainty of the three indicators runoff coefficient peak runoff and ss wash off increases with the increase of the area which indicates that parameter setting will have a more significant impact on the hydrological response of lid facilities with a larger area however when the area ratio of it facilities exceeds 3 5 the uncertainties of runoff coefficient peak flow and ss wash off are significantly reduced as shown in fig 2 the lower scatter of the simulation results of the three indicators forms a horizontal straight line at the bottom while the upper scatter mainly presents a downward trend however this reduction in uncertainty is not due to the it infrastructure itself but rather the combination of it and the case plot itself due to the limitation of actual water collection capacity part of rainwater in the sub catchment cannot flow into lid so when lid is further expanded it will not significantly change the hydrological control effect of the whole area for areas with similar case plots more than 3 5 of the it area is not necessary to cope with annual rainfall resulting in a significant reduction in the facilities utility among the simulation results for vs the best control effect occurs in the lower edge of the scatter forming region these points represent the minimum runoff coefficient peak runoff and ss wash off that may occur in the sub catchment with the increase in lid area ratio the three hydrological indicators decreased but it could be seen that their decline rate did not remain unchanged but started fast and then showed a slight slowing trend it shows that the increase of lid facility area has a diminishing marginal effect especially in the control of peak runoff within a reasonable area ratio with the increase of area ratio lid facilities have gradually increased their effectiveness in controlling runoff coefficient peak runoff and ss wash off however the impact played by different types of facilities is significantly different in the transfer lid the hydrological control effect of vs is generally weaker than it when the area ratio is the same there are overlaps in the scatterplot of peak runoff control between two facilities which indicates that the peak control effect is close under some parameter combinations with the same area ratio still these overlaps are few and only exist in cases where the area ratio is below 5 for bio retention cells permeable pavements and rain gardens which are lid facilities that belong to detention and water storage detention lids the differences in their hydrological control effects are not noticeable however when the lid facilities operate normally without considering blockage the permeable pavement has the best control impact of the three indicators and requires the smallest footprint for the unit plot when the combination of parameters of lid facilities is ideal a 2 5 area ratio of permeable pavement can reach the upper limit of the control effect on the three indicators bio retention cells and rain gardens have similar control effects and require at least a 4 5 area ratio to reach the three indicators upper limit of control effects from the perspective of uncertainty bio retention cells and rain gardens are similar and more than permeable pavements table 4 lists pearson correlation coefficients of the lid area ratio and three hydrological indicators for the five lid facilities it can be seen that lid area ratio is negatively correlated with the three hydrological indicators while there are positive correlations between the three hydrological indicators and the correlation coefficients are high except for the correlation coefficient between the runoff coefficient of vs and the peak runoff the rest are all above 0 9 3 2 optimization of lid facilities parameters from fig 2 and fig 3 we can see that parameters significantly influence the simulation result although the value of each parameter used in this study is within the reasonable range it does not mean that the combination of parameters is reasonable enough when the parameter combination of lid facilities is not reasonable the rainwater s storage infiltration and transfer efficiency among each layer of lid facilities can t be smooth which is easy to produce a bottleneck effect to fail to achieve the expected runoff control effect only under the condition of reasonable parameter combination can the model simulation more accurately reflect the hydrological control effect of typical lid facilities therefore random combinations of parameters without constraints can lead to significant uncertainty in general designers of experienced lid facilities can design coordinated drainage systems according to regional conditions and simultaneously satisfy multiple hydrological control effects reducing uncertainty in order to avoid the bottleneck of lid facilities and realize the hydrological control effect as efficiently as possible under the limited area pareto optimal principle is adopted here to find the optimal combination of its parameters the pareto optimal principle obtains the optimized parameter combination with a relatively minimum runoff coefficient a relatively minimum peak runoff a relatively minimum ss wash off and a relatively minimum area ratio the orange points in fig 4 a are the pareto optimal simulation results and the corresponding parameter combinations are optimal pareto optimal result is an optimal scheme that guarantees multiple indexes simultaneously taking the bio retention cells as an example in the figure of the runoff coefficient index some blue points on the left boundary represent the optimal results for controlling the runoff coefficient however these points are not marked orange because the combination of parameters corresponding to these results does not optimize the other indicators peak runoff and ss wash off 3 3 correlationship of hydrological indicators lid facilities can simultaneously affect runoff coefficient peak flow and ss wash off in pareto optimal results the correlation between each pair of different indicators can be obtained by regression analysis as shown in fig 5 r2 is the coefficient of determination used to evaluate the likelihood of the statistical model according to the fitting function the relationship among the hydrological impact effects of each type of lid facility can be seen the correlations among the hydrological indicators of lid facilities are usually pronounced r2 greater than 0 95 except vs when the combination of parameters is reasonable the runoff coefficient and peak runoff ss wash off and peak runoff all show positive correlationship and conform to the response relationship of the exponential function runoff coefficient and ss wash off also show positive correlation characteristics but offer the response relationship of the linear function in fig 5 the functional relationship among the three indicators of each lid facility is demonstrated the functional relationship between runoff coefficient peak runoff and ss wash off are as follows 2 y 1 a e x p d y 3 3 y 2 k y 3 e 4 y 1 a e x p d y 2 where a b c d and e are parameters of the functional relationship y1 y2 and y3 are peak runoff ss wash off and runoff coefficient respectively among the five lid facilities the fitting effects of hydrological indicators of it pp rg and brc are ideal r2 0 98 when the scatter plot composed of the three indexes of lid facilities is concentrated on the trend line any index can more accurately estimate the values of other indexes it shows that it pp rg and brc are relatively easy to be estimated for their hydrological effects by measuring one of the hydrological indicators among peak flow runoff coefficient and ss wash off other indicators can be estimated according to the functional relationship in a large number of simulation results for vs the first two scatter plots can roughly present a narrow trend line when the runoff coefficient is less than 0 35 with the increase of runoff coefficient the scattered point gradually diverges and no longer presents the shape of a line it indicates that when the runoff coefficient increases the uncertainty of relying on vs to control the peak runoff or ss is relatively large it cannot be estimated between hydrological indicators like the other four types of lid facilities moreover the fitting function between ss wash off and peak flow is not accurate enough r2 0 77 it indicates that the response relationship between vs hydrological indicators is complex 3 4 lid facility scoring results the optimized parameter combinations after pareto optimal processing were ranked and scored for the indicators and the score was shown in table 5 for the runoff coefficient as an example when the percentage of lid area is between 0 and 2 and the runoff coefficient is between 0 and 4 the index score for this parameter combination is 100 points this scoring method gives a higher score when a parameter combination achieves better runoff control in a smaller area radar charts of the three indicators were drawn based on the results of the queuing scores as shown in fig 6 in terms of total control effect infiltration trenches scored higher than other lid facilities for all three indicators followed by permeable pavements rain gardens bio retention cells and vegetative swales therefore infiltration trenches are preferred when the optimal rainfall control effect is the goal followed by permeable pavements regarding the single indicator control effect the three indicator scores five types of lid facilities have the highest peak runoff followed by the ss wash off and runoff coefficient it can be considered that the lid facilities one year rainfall control effect is mainly reflected in the peak runoff the high scores and slight differences among the three indicators of infiltration trenches and detention lids indicate satisfying control effects on all three indicators the differences among the three indicator scores of vegetative swales are more pronounced vegetative swales have a better control effect of peak runoff while ss wash off and runoff coefficient are poorly controlled 4 conclusion this paper implemented stochastic runoff process simulation by modifying and calling the parameters of lid facilities in the swmm model through matlab the output results were optimized as well as uncertainty analysis to evaluate the effect of the five lid facilities on the control of runoff and came to the following conclusions 1 the scale of lid facilities should not be expanded blindly on the one hand the actual service area of lid facilities should be considered on the other hand the increase of lid facilities area has a diminishing marginal effect especially in controlling peak runoff 2 among the five types of lid facilities the permeable pavement requires the smallest area to achieve optimal control with 2 5 of the area to gain optimal control infiltration trenches follow with 3 5 of the area to achieve optimal control bio retention cells and rain gardens have similar control effects requiring 4 5 of the area vegetative swales have the worst control and require the highest area requiring at least 15 of the area therefore when the urban construction land is constrained permeable pavements are preferred for the detention lids and infiltration trenches are preferred for the transfer lids 3 within the conventional parameter range of lid the parameter values significantly affect the hydrological response of lid facilities among them the uncertainty of vegetative swales is the largest and the uncertainty of permeable pavement is the smallest with the increase of lid setting area the uncertainty of the effect of lid facilities also changes 4 the correlations among peak runoff runoff coefficient and ss wash off of the four types of lid facilities it pp rg and brc are good each index can be accurately estimated by using exponential functions or linear functions through any other index for vs when the runoff coefficient is greater than 0 35 the precision of the fitting function of the three indicators decreases obviously 5 infiltration trenches have the best control of runoff coefficient peak runoff and ss wash off infiltration trenches are preferred for optimal control of rainfall runoff and runoff pollutants followed by permeable pavements credit authorship contribution statement zhiming zhang conceptualization formal analysis funding

2961,low impact development lid facilities are the key to realizing the source control of stormwater however there are few studies on the control effects of different lid facilities on runoff volume and runoff quality in this paper based on the storm water management model swmm a monte carlo method was used to simulate the runoff process for five lid facilities the correlation analysis and scoring of the three indicators of runoff coefficient peak runoff and suspended solid ss wash off in the simulation results were conducted to evaluate the control effects of different lid facilities the simulation results showed an evident law of decreasing marginal effect in the deployed area of lid facilities in addition the uncertainty of the hydrological response of permeable pavement is the smallest among the five types of lid facilities and the uncertainty of vegetative swales is the largest under the suitable combination of parameters the area percentage of permeable pavement reaching the upper limit of the control effect of three indicators is the smallest the control effect of three indicators of infiltration trench is the best correlation analysis showed that the three indicators of the lid facilities could be estimated from each other through the regression relationship equation keywords low impact development storm water management model unit plot monte carlo runoff impact data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction with the rapid development of global urbanization the proportion of underlying permeable surfaces in urban areas has significantly decreased resulting in reduced interception ability and poor infiltration of urban rainwater locatelli et al 2017 sutton et al 2009 it also leads to the advance of peak runoff and increased runoff li et al 2018 moreover it is a common cause of waterlogging huong and pathirana 2011 at the same time rainfall and runoff usually deteriorate the water environment due to the lack of control over the pollution of urban non point sources and combined sewer overflow cso mailhot et al 2015 to mitigate the adverse hydrological effects of urban development the united states proposed the low impact development lid concept for rainwater control at the end of the twentieth century dietz 2007 this concept aims to reduce runoff volume and runoff pollution by controlling rainwater at the source of runoff by using small scale and decentralized facilities for infiltration and retention similar concepts of rainwater control include the sustainable urban drainage system suds in the united kingdom ferrans et al 2022 low impact urban design and development liudd in new zealand roon 2011 water sensitive urban design wsud in australia morison and brown 2011 and sponge city sc in china li et al 2017 through source control lid facilities can enable multi objective stormwater control such as runoff pollution runoff volume and peak runoff conventional lid facilities mainly include green roofs gr rain gardens rg vegetative swales vs bio retention cells brc rain barrels rb and permeable pavement pp in recent years several researchers have studied the hydrological control effects of these facilities through models and experiments in terms of peak runoff and total runoff volume sin et al 2014 and liu et al 2015a analyzed the roles of lid facilities in delaying the peak time of runoff and reducing the runoff volume based on the simulation of hydrological models swmm storm water management model and l thia lid hou et al 2020 and tirpak et al 2021 analyzed the water retention capability of rain gardens bio retention cells and permeable pavements by conducting long term hydrological monitoring of the study area harper et al 2015 conducted simulated rainfall experiments on green and concrete roof installations and found that green roofs can reduce runoff by 40 60 by calculating the effectiveness of stormwater control in several cities in the united states and europe that were retrofitted with lid facilities wang et al 2009 found that lid facilities can reduce stormwater runoff by 30 to 99 and delay the peak of stormwater runoff by 5 to 20 min zhu et al 2019 simulated the runoff process of permeable pavement under different rainfall return periods the results show that permeable pavement can reduce surface runoff by 50 95 and delay the flood peak time in addition lid facilities are also effective in removing runoff pollutants fan et al 2022 for suspended solids ss liu et al 2019 monitored the control effect of permeable pavements in several locations in shanghai and found that the removal rate of ss by permeable pavements ranged from 50 to 85 yin et al 2019 found that the removal rate of event mean concentration emc of ss for three types of green roofs ranged from 52 5 to 65 9 by monitoring natural rainfall over a long calendar period and artificially simulated rainfall experiments in addition many studies have verified that lid facilities can effectively remove nitrogen and phosphorus pollutants from runoff bing zheng et al 2013 kong et al 2021 taghizadeh et al 2021 stormwater problems vary from city to city due to many factors such as climatic conditions underlying surface types landforms and soils as a technical measure that can mitigate various stormwater problems baek et al 2015 lid facilities are widely used because of the advantages of a small footprint and low cost in recent years more studies have used swmm primarily to analyze the effects of hydrological control of lid facilities akter et al 2020 baek et al 2020 cipolla et al 2016 heidari et al 2022 however as the actual control effect of lid on runoff is affected by regional factors such as rainfall topography land use and soil there are few comparisons between lid facilities in different studies therefore this paper conducted stochastic simulations based on the swmm to compare the hydrological control effects of lid facilities under different parameter combinations and conducted correlation analyses for three indicators runoff coefficient peak runoff and ss wash off the queuing scoring method evaluated the hydrological control effects of lid facilities this study can provide a reference for the scientific selection of lid facilities 2 materials and methods 2 1 lid module in swmm the swmm is a rainfall runoff model proposed by the us environmental protection agency in the early 1970s gironás et al 2010 and has been widely used babaei et al 2018 rong et al 2021 zeng et al 2021 since version 5 1 013 the swmm has added the simulation function of lid facilities including eight conventional lid facilities biological retention cells rain gardens green roofs permeable pavements infiltration trenches rain barrels rooftop disconnections and vegetative swales wen liang et al 2012 in swmm lid facilities consisted of different component layers such as surface pavement soil storage and drain the specific component layers of different lid facilities are shown in table 1 the drain layer plays a role in conveying the runoff to the municipal pipeline network to reduce the uncertainty arising from the connection of lid facilities to the pipeline network the influence of the drain layer was not considered in this study 2 2 scenario settings to minimize the interference of other factors the sub catchment in the model is set as a square unit plot with a slope of 0 003 an area of 100 ha and imperviousness of 50 parameter settings for a unit plot refer to urban china geographic data a et al 2015 ai bing et al 2015 tang et al 2020 this type is representative of most plain cities in general arnold and gibbons 1996 brezonik and stadelmann 2002 to avoid the influence of the pipeline network on the lid control effect no drainage pipes are arranged on the unit plot the horton model is used to simulate the process of surface runoff infiltration and the runoff calculation method is dynamic wave the pollutant accumulation on the ground is according to the sat method with a maximum accumulation of 270 kg ha the parameter values of the unit plot are set as shown in table 2 in this study a plain city in northern china is used as an example with the design return period of rainfall being set to one year and the rainfall duration being set to one hour the distribution of typical rainfall time series is shown in fig 1 2 3 model simulation 2 3 1 monte carlo stochastic method the monte carlo stochastic method obtains multiple sets of parameters or combinations of variables by random sampling methods it simulates each set of numerical variables separately to get many outputs for statistical analysis which is usually used to analyze the uncertainty of hydrological models jeremiah et al 2012 liu et al 2015b turgut et al 2021 in this study each type of lid facility was simulated 10 000 times according to the range of values of input parameters of lid facilities in the model manual the parameters were randomly sampled modified by matlab program scripts and completed the swmm simulations the results of multiple simulations for each type of facility were statistically analyzed regarding the guidance on promoting sponge city construction issued by the general office of the state council of the people s republic of china runoff coefficient peak runoff and pollutant flushing were selected as evaluation indicators of the lid control effect ss wash off is selected as the analysis object for pollutant flushing as an essential carrier of urban runoff pollution ss adsorbs various insoluble organic and inorganic substances sediment and microorganisms so it correlates well with cod tn tp and other common runoff pollutant indicators zhao et al 2015 2 3 2 lid facility parameters in the manual for the swmm the value range of each parameter is given for example the parameter thickness in the soil layer which describes the thickness of the soil layer is 450 900 mm for rain gardens and bio retention cells so in the random sampling of this parameter in this study the upper limit was set to 900 mm the lower limit was set to 450 mm and the sampling distribution was chosen to be uniform regarding pollutant flushing the swmm manual gives the emc event mean concentrations parameters for tss total suspended solid in the range of 180 548 mg l the range of parameter values for different lid facilities is shown in table 3 2 4 queuing score for lid facility effect the queuing scoring method is widely used due to its simplicity and ease of implementation fei yan et al 2014 zhang et al 2021 the indicators were ranked according to their strengths and weaknesses for the three indicators of runoff coefficient peak runoff and ss wash off in the simulation results positive indicators are ranked from most significant to most minor and negative indicators are ranked from smallest to largest the first ranked indicator corresponds to 100 points the last ranked indicator corresponds to 0 points and the rest of the scores are calculated according to the following formula 1 x 100 n 1 n 1 100 where x is the score of queuing for the actual value of an indicator n is the total number of simulation results participating in queuing and n is the ranking of the actual value of the indicator the frequency of the actual value of each indicator is counted and the actual value of all indicators in the queue is multiplied by the corresponding frequency of occurrence the expected value of the indicator is obtained by summing up the multiplied results in this study when the strengths and weaknesses of indicators in different parameter combinations are the same the area ratio is used as their scoring criteria the smaller the floor area of the lid facility under the same indicator merit condition the higher the score of that parameter combination because of the large number of parameter combinations involved in scoring the scoring process would be too cumbersome if all indicators of each combination were scored to simplify the scoring process and reduce the number of calculations all parameter combinations are divided into ranges according to the degree of superiority and inferiority of the indicators and the size of area ratio 3 results and discussion 3 1 uncertainty analysis of different lid facilities vegetative swales vs infiltration trenches it bio retention cells brc permeable pavements pp and rain gardens rg are typical lid facilities that can accept water from upstream vegetative swales and infiltration trenches carry the role of diversion in contrast bio retention cells permeable pavements and rain gardens care for detention and water storage according to the monte carlo simulation results the control effect of each type of lid facility on hydrology with different combinations of parameters can be seen as shown in fig 2 each point in the scatter plot represents a simulation result the uncertainty of the hydrological response of the vegetative swales increased with the area at an area ratio of 5 the variation of the runoff coefficient per unit plot ranges from 0 3 to 0 4 when the area ratio increased to 10 the runoff coefficient per unit plot variation increased to between 0 25 and 0 4 moreover the peak runoff and ss wash off had similar effects which indicated that the selection of parameter combinations significantly impacted the lid facility s hydrologic response even within the conventional parameter range in the it simulation results the uncertainty of the simulation increases first and then decreases when the it area ratio is less than 3 5 the simulated uncertainty of the three indicators runoff coefficient peak runoff and ss wash off increases with the increase of the area which indicates that parameter setting will have a more significant impact on the hydrological response of lid facilities with a larger area however when the area ratio of it facilities exceeds 3 5 the uncertainties of runoff coefficient peak flow and ss wash off are significantly reduced as shown in fig 2 the lower scatter of the simulation results of the three indicators forms a horizontal straight line at the bottom while the upper scatter mainly presents a downward trend however this reduction in uncertainty is not due to the it infrastructure itself but rather the combination of it and the case plot itself due to the limitation of actual water collection capacity part of rainwater in the sub catchment cannot flow into lid so when lid is further expanded it will not significantly change the hydrological control effect of the whole area for areas with similar case plots more than 3 5 of the it area is not necessary to cope with annual rainfall resulting in a significant reduction in the facilities utility among the simulation results for vs the best control effect occurs in the lower edge of the scatter forming region these points represent the minimum runoff coefficient peak runoff and ss wash off that may occur in the sub catchment with the increase in lid area ratio the three hydrological indicators decreased but it could be seen that their decline rate did not remain unchanged but started fast and then showed a slight slowing trend it shows that the increase of lid facility area has a diminishing marginal effect especially in the control of peak runoff within a reasonable area ratio with the increase of area ratio lid facilities have gradually increased their effectiveness in controlling runoff coefficient peak runoff and ss wash off however the impact played by different types of facilities is significantly different in the transfer lid the hydrological control effect of vs is generally weaker than it when the area ratio is the same there are overlaps in the scatterplot of peak runoff control between two facilities which indicates that the peak control effect is close under some parameter combinations with the same area ratio still these overlaps are few and only exist in cases where the area ratio is below 5 for bio retention cells permeable pavements and rain gardens which are lid facilities that belong to detention and water storage detention lids the differences in their hydrological control effects are not noticeable however when the lid facilities operate normally without considering blockage the permeable pavement has the best control impact of the three indicators and requires the smallest footprint for the unit plot when the combination of parameters of lid facilities is ideal a 2 5 area ratio of permeable pavement can reach the upper limit of the control effect on the three indicators bio retention cells and rain gardens have similar control effects and require at least a 4 5 area ratio to reach the three indicators upper limit of control effects from the perspective of uncertainty bio retention cells and rain gardens are similar and more than permeable pavements table 4 lists pearson correlation coefficients of the lid area ratio and three hydrological indicators for the five lid facilities it can be seen that lid area ratio is negatively correlated with the three hydrological indicators while there are positive correlations between the three hydrological indicators and the correlation coefficients are high except for the correlation coefficient between the runoff coefficient of vs and the peak runoff the rest are all above 0 9 3 2 optimization of lid facilities parameters from fig 2 and fig 3 we can see that parameters significantly influence the simulation result although the value of each parameter used in this study is within the reasonable range it does not mean that the combination of parameters is reasonable enough when the parameter combination of lid facilities is not reasonable the rainwater s storage infiltration and transfer efficiency among each layer of lid facilities can t be smooth which is easy to produce a bottleneck effect to fail to achieve the expected runoff control effect only under the condition of reasonable parameter combination can the model simulation more accurately reflect the hydrological control effect of typical lid facilities therefore random combinations of parameters without constraints can lead to significant uncertainty in general designers of experienced lid facilities can design coordinated drainage systems according to regional conditions and simultaneously satisfy multiple hydrological control effects reducing uncertainty in order to avoid the bottleneck of lid facilities and realize the hydrological control effect as efficiently as possible under the limited area pareto optimal principle is adopted here to find the optimal combination of its parameters the pareto optimal principle obtains the optimized parameter combination with a relatively minimum runoff coefficient a relatively minimum peak runoff a relatively minimum ss wash off and a relatively minimum area ratio the orange points in fig 4 a are the pareto optimal simulation results and the corresponding parameter combinations are optimal pareto optimal result is an optimal scheme that guarantees multiple indexes simultaneously taking the bio retention cells as an example in the figure of the runoff coefficient index some blue points on the left boundary represent the optimal results for controlling the runoff coefficient however these points are not marked orange because the combination of parameters corresponding to these results does not optimize the other indicators peak runoff and ss wash off 3 3 correlationship of hydrological indicators lid facilities can simultaneously affect runoff coefficient peak flow and ss wash off in pareto optimal results the correlation between each pair of different indicators can be obtained by regression analysis as shown in fig 5 r2 is the coefficient of determination used to evaluate the likelihood of the statistical model according to the fitting function the relationship among the hydrological impact effects of each type of lid facility can be seen the correlations among the hydrological indicators of lid facilities are usually pronounced r2 greater than 0 95 except vs when the combination of parameters is reasonable the runoff coefficient and peak runoff ss wash off and peak runoff all show positive correlationship and conform to the response relationship of the exponential function runoff coefficient and ss wash off also show positive correlation characteristics but offer the response relationship of the linear function in fig 5 the functional relationship among the three indicators of each lid facility is demonstrated the functional relationship between runoff coefficient peak runoff and ss wash off are as follows 2 y 1 a e x p d y 3 3 y 2 k y 3 e 4 y 1 a e x p d y 2 where a b c d and e are parameters of the functional relationship y1 y2 and y3 are peak runoff ss wash off and runoff coefficient respectively among the five lid facilities the fitting effects of hydrological indicators of it pp rg and brc are ideal r2 0 98 when the scatter plot composed of the three indexes of lid facilities is concentrated on the trend line any index can more accurately estimate the values of other indexes it shows that it pp rg and brc are relatively easy to be estimated for their hydrological effects by measuring one of the hydrological indicators among peak flow runoff coefficient and ss wash off other indicators can be estimated according to the functional relationship in a large number of simulation results for vs the first two scatter plots can roughly present a narrow trend line when the runoff coefficient is less than 0 35 with the increase of runoff coefficient the scattered point gradually diverges and no longer presents the shape of a line it indicates that when the runoff coefficient increases the uncertainty of relying on vs to control the peak runoff or ss is relatively large it cannot be estimated between hydrological indicators like the other four types of lid facilities moreover the fitting function between ss wash off and peak flow is not accurate enough r2 0 77 it indicates that the response relationship between vs hydrological indicators is complex 3 4 lid facility scoring results the optimized parameter combinations after pareto optimal processing were ranked and scored for the indicators and the score was shown in table 5 for the runoff coefficient as an example when the percentage of lid area is between 0 and 2 and the runoff coefficient is between 0 and 4 the index score for this parameter combination is 100 points this scoring method gives a higher score when a parameter combination achieves better runoff control in a smaller area radar charts of the three indicators were drawn based on the results of the queuing scores as shown in fig 6 in terms of total control effect infiltration trenches scored higher than other lid facilities for all three indicators followed by permeable pavements rain gardens bio retention cells and vegetative swales therefore infiltration trenches are preferred when the optimal rainfall control effect is the goal followed by permeable pavements regarding the single indicator control effect the three indicator scores five types of lid facilities have the highest peak runoff followed by the ss wash off and runoff coefficient it can be considered that the lid facilities one year rainfall control effect is mainly reflected in the peak runoff the high scores and slight differences among the three indicators of infiltration trenches and detention lids indicate satisfying control effects on all three indicators the differences among the three indicator scores of vegetative swales are more pronounced vegetative swales have a better control effect of peak runoff while ss wash off and runoff coefficient are poorly controlled 4 conclusion this paper implemented stochastic runoff process simulation by modifying and calling the parameters of lid facilities in the swmm model through matlab the output results were optimized as well as uncertainty analysis to evaluate the effect of the five lid facilities on the control of runoff and came to the following conclusions 1 the scale of lid facilities should not be expanded blindly on the one hand the actual service area of lid facilities should be considered on the other hand the increase of lid facilities area has a diminishing marginal effect especially in controlling peak runoff 2 among the five types of lid facilities the permeable pavement requires the smallest area to achieve optimal control with 2 5 of the area to gain optimal control infiltration trenches follow with 3 5 of the area to achieve optimal control bio retention cells and rain gardens have similar control effects requiring 4 5 of the area vegetative swales have the worst control and require the highest area requiring at least 15 of the area therefore when the urban construction land is constrained permeable pavements are preferred for the detention lids and infiltration trenches are preferred for the transfer lids 3 within the conventional parameter range of lid the parameter values significantly affect the hydrological response of lid facilities among them the uncertainty of vegetative swales is the largest and the uncertainty of permeable pavement is the smallest with the increase of lid setting area the uncertainty of the effect of lid facilities also changes 4 the correlations among peak runoff runoff coefficient and ss wash off of the four types of lid facilities it pp rg and brc are good each index can be accurately estimated by using exponential functions or linear functions through any other index for vs when the runoff coefficient is greater than 0 35 the precision of the fitting function of the three indicators decreases obviously 5 infiltration trenches have the best control of runoff coefficient peak runoff and ss wash off infiltration trenches are preferred for optimal control of rainfall runoff and runoff pollutants followed by permeable pavements credit authorship contribution statement zhiming zhang conceptualization formal analysis funding

2962,urbanisation is a recognized driver of changes in catchment river flow however quantifying the urban influence remains a major challenge due to the brevity of land cover records and the challenge of isolating this signal from other drivers this study assesses the contribution of urbanisation to changes in river discharge across different seasons and quantiles low median high mean and peak flows twelve catchments 21 1660 km2 are selected after screening all gauged uk catchments for minimal human influences other than significant changes in urban land cover generalized additive models for location scale and shape gamlss are developed using long 40 63 years historical records of precipitation temperature urban land cover and daily river discharge m3 s model coefficients reveal that increased urban area is associated with a rise in discharge across all flow quantiles and seasons on average and the contribution of urbanisation to non stationarity is stronger for low flows and average flows than it is for high flows for every 1 increase in urban land cover there is an associated increase in the median of 1 9 2 8 1 s d for low flow 0 9 2 3 1 s d for median flow 0 9 1 9 1 s d for mean flow 1 1 2 0 1 s d for high flow and 0 5 2 2 1 s d for seasonal maximum flow across seasons the urbanisation flow signal tends to be greatest in catchments with less initial urban extent and low bedrock permeability keywords urbanisation river flow non stationary urban extent statistical modelling attribution data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction historical trends in both mean and peak river flow in the uk broadly reveal increases in the northwest and a mix of increases and decreases in the southeast hannaford et al 2021 hannaford and buys 2012 hannaford and marsh 2006 hannaford and marsh 2008 harrigan et al 2018 prosdocimi et al 2014 these regional variations differ from river flow projections of mean and peak flow for coming decades based on the latest uk climate projections ukcp outlooks suggest increases for western britain with some decreases in central and eastern england and eastern scotland kay 2021 lane et al 2021 yet historical and projected climate show similar trends since 1960 the uk has warmed by about 0 2 c per decade and with 6 increase in annual average precipitation mcsweeney et al 2009 kendon et al 2020 by the 2060s the country is expected to witness 1 2 1 8 c further warming and 1 8 7 2 increase in annual precipitation depending on the emission scenario lowe et al 2018 mcsweeney et al 2009 thus the spatial discrepancy in observed and projected river flow trends as well as the heterogeneity of local trends raises the question of whether future climate driven river flow projection should be taken at face value or whether we may be missing some key drivers of non stationary river flow slater et al 2021 wilby et al 2008 local catchment specific drivers may also play an important role such as urbanisation dawson et al 2006 faulkner et al 2020 hannaford et al 2021 quantifying the effect of urbanisation on river flow is not straightforward some authors have found that urbanisation increases flows as impervious land cover leads to reduced infiltration increased runoff volume as well as shortened runoff response time blum et al 2020 cuo 2016 de niel and willems 2019 prosdocimi et al 2015 teuling et al 2019 anderson et al 2022 various modelling approaches have been applied for example prosdocimi et al 2015 employed point process models in a paired catchment study that included one urbanised catchment and a nearby rural catchment with similar hydrological characteristics and detected an increase in high flows due to urbanisation especially in summer blum et al 2020 employed panel regression models with a large sample of us catchments and estimated that a 1 increase in urban cover leads to on average 3 3 increase in annual maximum floods de niel and willems 2019 fitted statistical regression models to 29 catchments in belgium and found the land cover effect on peak flows varies signicantly across catchments depending on soil textures and slopes they estimated that a 1 increase in urban area could cause up to a 5 increase in peak flows in steep catchments with a high percentage of loamic soils by applying conceptual rainfall runoff models to 95 catchments in the rhine basin hundecha and bárdossy 2004 found that urbanisation increased summer peak flows and also caused a modest rise in winter peak flows using distributional regression models in 290 catchments in the us midwest slater and villarini 2017 found that a 10 increase in population density a proxy for urbanisation was associated with more than a 20 increase in median streamflow in summer some studies report contrary responses in catchments with specific characteristics using linear mixed effects modelling of 19 watersheds in central arizona usa mcphillips et al 2019 found that in arid catchments urbanisation decreases flood flashiness flow variability and hydrograph rise and fall rates the decreasing effects were explained in terms of increased retention by engineered basins of water during storm events instead of flowing directly to the river others suggest that urbanisation effects on river flow or hydrologic response are inconsistent or difficult to detect this could reflect differences in the methods applied e g anderson et al 2022 or the difficulty in quantifying urbanisation typically quantified as the catchment urban area fraction or the mean areal imperviousness such urbanisation metrics may not sufficiently explain the location distribution and character of impervious cover within a given catchment salavati et al 2016 like tolstoy s unhappy families every urban catchment is urbanised in its own way for example impervious areas that drain runoff to pervious surfaces may have less effect on river flow than impervious areas that are directly connected to the drainage system jacobson 2011 vesuviano and miller 2019 found that in an urban catchment in swindon uk the effect of draining to pervious surfaces could even reduce the peak flows to below what would be expected for a rural catchment other reasons may be that it is difficult to isolate the signal of urbanisation from other drivers e g climate change and other headwater land cover changes or from background hydrologic noise e g the imports and exports of sewage water across catchment boundaries upstream river regulation and ground and surface water abstraction beyond uncertainties in the underlying river flow observations wilby et al 2017 the river flow response can differ significantly between catchments due to poorly observed confounding factors such as variable soil composition subsurface geology infrastructure systems and water resources management strategies steinschneider et al 2013 furthermore absence of an urban signal may be due to the offsetting influence of other factors for instance the positive effects of urbanisation on runoff may become insignificant due to flood reduction measures such as sustainable urban drainage systems and flood attenuation features although various studies have shown that urbanisation may alter river flow distributions the role of catchment properties combined with rates of urbanisation are poorly understood this paper is the first to quantify and compare the contribution of urbanisation to trends in river discharge using carefully selected catchments across the uk with long median 58 years observed records under different flow quantiles and seasons we ask to what extent do urbanisation signatures manifest differentially by 1 river flow quantiles low to high flows 2 season 3 underlying geology and flow regime in summary we explore the sensitivity of the urban signature to flow quantile season and catchment properties 2 study catchments and data 2 1 selection of study catchments the study catchments were selected from the national river flow archive nrfa https nrfa ceh ac uk the primary source of hydrometric information in the uk the total number of nrfa stations available is 1598 after applying strict filtering criteria see fig 1 a sub set of 12 eligible sites were retained for detailed investigation filtering was applied to identify only sites where an urban influence might be objectively detectable by excluding sites with 1 less than 90 of daily discharge values in each year during the period 1985 2015 coinciding with the initial period with satellite observations of urbanisation 2 upstream storage or impounding reservoirs as denoted by nrfa factors affecting runoff far codes which indicate artificial influences within the catchment that might alter the natural runoff 3 stationary flood series on the basis that it only makes sense to detect a non stationary driver if there is non stationarity in the underlying time series based on the change point and expert assessment compiled by faulkner et al 2021 sites identified as suitable by faulkner et al 2021 are those with non stationary annual maximum flow amax and where the data quality is sufficient to detect non stationarity sufficient data quality means the length of flow data the percentage of missing data and the consistency of the data are good enough to be used in statistical tests it is worth noting that although the flood series are non stationary other flow quantiles may not be 4 less than 5 urban cover change during the study period 40 63 years depending on the length of the observed river discharge record the rationale being that a minimum amount of change in the predictor variable is necessary for robust statistical detection 5 suspect values for urban data which had a 30 discrepancy between extracted satellite based urban percent from liu et al 2020 compared with the urban extent from nrfa for the year 1990 and camels gb for the year 2015 as well as one site with an unrealistic decrease in the reconstructed urban extent time series using household based estimates we retained only the sites with non stationary streamflow to objectively quantify the contribution of urbanisation to observed streamflow trends across all the flow quantiles from low to high if instead the aim was to assess whether urbanization has a detectable effect on streamflow we might have included sites with stationary flood series however there are only 4 additional stationary sites that meet the criteria good flow record absence of major human influence such as reservoirs presence of significant urban land change and reliable urban data sites 17003 19001 27030 and 28026 sites that have experienced significant urbanisation but show stationary flow are very likely have other drivers or other artificial influences that affect river flow for instance the 4 additional stationary sites all reported either public water supply abstraction industrial and or agricultural abstraction or groundwater abstraction nrfa 2022 stationary sites were therefore excluded to focus on the contribution of urbanisation to flow non stationarity this catchment selection workflow is also theoretically applicable to other global catchments through adapting each criterion based on available datasets for example by employing alternative data sources as a comparison an equal number of non urbanising catchments 12 which have less than 2 5 urban change over the study period were also selected using the same site selection procedure as described above but changing only the urban change criterion from more than 5 to less than 2 5 after applying all the filtering steps the locations of the short listed 12 urbanising catchments and 12 non urbanising catchments are presented in fig 2 and the summary of urbanising catchments is in table 1 most of the urban sites are near large cities that have experienced rapid urbanisation over recent decades including london and birmingham drainage areas range between 21 km2 and 1660 km2 mean annual precipitation from 604 mm to 868 mm and mean daily discharge varies between 0 17 m3 s to 11 53 m3 s land cover according to the nrfa includes woodland 3 9 to 41 7 of catchment area arable horticultural 3 7 to 69 grassland 13 7 to 29 7 heath bog 0 to 2 8 and urban extent 8 2 to 72 5 the catchments are underlain by various geological and superficial deposits the strata span high e g fissured aquifer for bedrock sand and gravel for superficial deposits low e g impermeable rock for bedrock clay and peat for superficial deposits and mixed permeability e g confined aquifer for bedrock brickearth and alluvium for superficial deposits nrfa 2022 2 2 data collection and processing daily flow data were retrieved for the selected catchments using the rnrfa r package vitolo et al 2016 catchment shapefiles were automatically extracted from camels gb coxon et al 2020 or downloaded from the nrfa if the catchment was not included in camels gb catchment averaged daily precipitation 1950 to 2020 and monthly mean temperature 1884 to 2020 were extracted from the met office hadley centre for climate science and services haduk grid with 5 km resolution hollis et al 2019 annual urban land cover percent during 1985 to 2015 was based on satellite derived 30 m resolution global urban maps liu et al 2020 urban extent for the year 1990 from the nrfa weighted sum of urban and suburban land cover map classes and urban extent for the year 2015 from camels gb coxon et al 2020 percentage of urban and suburban extent based on the land cover map 2015 were also obtained as references to assess the extracted urban time series to reconstruct urban extent prior to 1985 time series of total households from census data available from 1951 to 2011 were downloaded and employed as a proxy for urban percent great britain historical gis project 2017 since census data are collected based on administrative units the total households from the local authority covering the main course of the river were used for each catchment a linear scaling method shrestha et al 2017 was used to relate household data to the satellite urban area series we computed the conversion factor as shown in table 1 between the extracted 30 m resolution urban percent time series red line in fig 3 and the household data over the period 1985 2011 we applied the same conversion factor to the raw household data then employed the converted household data blue line in fig 3 to reconstruct the urban percent time series back to 1951 under the assumption that pre 1985 and post 1985 periods have the same developed area associated with each household the final extended urban percent time series is a blend of the household based estimates for 1951 1984 with the satellite based urban percent for 1985 2015 figs 2 3 to investigate whether other factors may modulate the contribution of urbanization to observed non stationarity on river discharge catchment attributes such as drainage area base flow index bfi factors affecting runoff far urban extent land cover and geology data were obtained from the nrfa catalogue nrfa 2022 detailed water import export information at the catchment level including the fully licenced quantity of surface water abstraction groundwater abstraction and discharge were obtained from environment agency environment agency 2021 3 methodology 3 1 model development and performance evaluation generalized additive models for location scale and shape gamlss were used to quantify the contribution of urbanisation to trends in river discharge gamlss were introduced by rigby and stasinopoulos 2005 and are flexible semiparametric regression models they allow any parametric distribution for the response variable and allow a variety of additive terms for the distribution parameters which can be modelled as linear non linear or non parametric smooth functions of the explanatory variables stasinopoulos and rigby 2007 we implemented gamlss using the gamlss r package stasinopoulos et al 2017 two gamlss models were developed at each site to estimate relationships between the river flow and the predictors precipitation x p temperature x t antecedent precipitation x ap and urbanisation area x u for different seasons and flow quantiles variable x p is the seasonal precipitation total mm computed as catchment averages from daily precipitation observations x ap is the accumulated catchment average precipitation mm for the previous season employed as an indicator of soil moisture initial conditions for example if the predictand is summer low flow then x p is the sum of precipitation from june to august every year and x ap is the sum of precipitation for the previous season march to may variable x t is seasonal catchment average temperature c and x u is urban land cover for the catchments on an annual basis the gamma distribution which has been frequently employed for streamflow modelling in previous studies prekopa and szantai 1978 yue 2001 yue et al 2001 was used for the response variable river flow with two parameters i e the location parameter μ which defines the location of the distribution and the scale parameter σ which defines its statistical dispersion for simplicity μ is linearly dependent on the predictors through a logarithmic function whereas σ is held constant following slater and villarini 2018 since varying this parameter over time does not systematically improve the fits of the gamlss models for river discharge villarini and strong 2014 the model formulations are shown in table 2 model 1 m1 is without urbanisation whereas model 2 m2 includes urbanisation notations a b c d and e are regression coefficients for brevity m1 is referred as q p t ap and m2 is referred as q p t ap u where q stands for river discharge and p t ap and u correspond to the predictors x p x t x ap and x u respectively the seasons are spring march april may summer june july august autumn september october november and winter december january february the analysed river discharge quantiles are low flow 10th percentile denoted by q 0 1 median flow 50th percentile denoted by q 0 5 high flow 90th percentile denoted by q 0 9 mean flow denoted by q mean and seasonal maximum flow denoted by q max calculated from daily discharge records for every season and year the akaike information criterion aic and worm plots were used to assess the goodness of fit of the gamlss models the formula of aic is defined as eq 1 where k is the number of model parameters and l is the maximum value of the log likelihood estimate akaike 1974 lower aic indicates a better model fit worm plots are detrended qq plots of the model residuals see fig s1 and fig s2 in supplementary material for a well fitted model the dots should be close to the central horizontal line and 95 of them distributed between the upper and lower curve stasinopoulos et al 2017 1 aic 2 k 2 l n l 3 2 analysis of urbanisation coefficients the coefficients for urbanisation e 2 from m2 in table 2 which describe the change in discharge for every unit change in urban area were extracted for further analysis using the regression model we assess the effect of a unit increase in the predictor in this case urban land cover on the predictand streamflow this approach allows a straightforward comparison of the effect of a unit 1 increase in urbanisation on streamflow across different locations given that our model is a logarithm model as shown in table 2 the urbanisation coefficients were then transformed to be expressed as percentage values using exp e 2 1 100 to give the percentage change in discharge for every one percent change in urbanisation the p values associated with the urbanisation coefficients were also analysed to assess their statistical significance if the p value is less than the significance level p 0 05 then it implies that the urban covariate has a statistically significant relationship with river discharge in the model and the urbanisation coefficient is significantly different from zero effects of catchment properties e g urban extent drainage area and bedrock permeability were analysed by fitting a linear regression between the extracted urbanisation coefficients and each catchment property across different flow quantiles and seasons the regression p value and coefficient of determination r2 show the significance of these relationships 3 3 effects of other model predictors additionally we assessed the effect of adding other predictors such as 1 day maximum rainfall and antecedent day maximum on the model fit and coefficients we do so because such predictors may better describe high flows q max than seasonal precipitation total x p or accumulated catchment average precipitation for the previous season x ap changes in aic and urban coefficients were analysed after including 1 day maximum rainfall and antecedent day maximum as additional predictors in the urban models m2 previous work has highlighted that beyond proving evidence of the consistency of specific drivers e g discharge change consistent with urbanisation change robust hydrological attribution also requires testing of inconsistency i e when flow change is inconsistent with changes in other drivers merz et al 2012 such evidence is particularly important in the case of statistical modelling where a monotonically increasing variable such as urbanisation or time may inadvertently track other monotonically increasing catchment drivers of river flows such as greenhouse gas concentrations or storm intensity therefore to assess the consistency inconsistency of an urban effect on river flow we also tested the effects of adding time as an additional covariate representative of any monotonically increasing driver at non urbanising sites two models q p t ap q p t ap time were fitted for both 12 urbanising and 12 non urbanising catchments for each season where the time covariate is simply the year of record the aic values for models with and without time covariate were compared to assess the effect of including a monotonically increasing covariate on model performance 4 results and discussions 4 1 performance of the urban models model fits for an exemplar catchment blackwater at swallowfield are shown in fig 4 low flow across all the seasons and fig 5 autumn season across different flow quantiles for the blackwater aic values for urban models m2 are much lower than for models without urbanisation m1 for low flow across all seasons e g spring low flow aic m2 5 87 aic m1 55 36 the model fits are also much better in autumn across low flow median flow and mean flow fig 5 this indicates that urban models perform significantly better in simulating historical flow for these quantiles the fits are satisfactory since the observations closely follow the fitted distribution and are mostly well within the 5th 95th percentiles the goodness of fit is also indicated by worm plots see figs s1 and s2 comparison between m1 and m2 for this catchment indicates that urbanisation is associated with river discharge increase figs 4 and 5 extracted coefficients indicate that a 1 increase in urban extent increases the low median high mean and seasonal maximum discharge by 3 5 2 6 1 6 2 0 and 1 0 respectively in autumn fig 5 the strongest effect is seen for the low flows whereby a 1 increase in urban extent increases discharge by 3 5 3 4 4 3 and 2 5 in autumn spring summer and winter seasons respectively fig 4 the increasing effect tends to be more significant for low flow and for the summer season one possible explanation for the greater contribution of urbanisation to low flow versus high flow may be that the absolute effect i e the magnitude of change in streamflow caused by urbanization is proportionately larger relative to the total streamflow when flows are low low flow tends to occur during the summer months when there is less rain and more evapotranspiration due to the higher temperature burn et al 2008 however we cannot discount that there may be another explanation sewer systems and hard drainage networks are usually developed as part of the urbanisation process thus discharge from sewage works may also play a role in increasing low flows smakhtin 2001 in other words it is not impossible that urbanisation may be acting as a proxy for more sewage discharge and or water imports across catchment boundaries which would have a proportionately larger effect on low flow volumes comparisons of aic values between the two models m1 model without urbanisation and m2 model with urbanisation across different seasons and flow quantiles for all the sites are shown in fig 6 the majority of m2 aic values are lower than m1 in some cases m1 shows a better aic but the aic differences between m1 and m2 are very low less than 2 differences of less than 2 imply that neither model is significantly better than the other burnham and anderson 1998 overall the aic comparisons indicate that the urban model m2 performs better the model fits are improved when urban percent is included as a covariate and the colour gradient shows the improvement is more significant for low flow median flow and mean flow across different seasons the worm plots indicate the m2 fits for the 12 sites are adequate as the dots are all near the red horizontal line and lie between the upper and lower dotted curves which denote 95 confidence intervals we show example worm plots for the blackwater at swallowfield 39007 in fig s1 and fig s2 but not all sites 4 seasons 5 flow quantiles 13 sites 4 2 assessment of the contribution of urbanisation to non stationarity distributions of the transformed urban coefficients expressed as percentages for different seasons and flow quantiles are presented in fig 7 we find that the magnitude of the contribution of urbanisation to river discharge non stationarity varies considerably by catchment depending on season flow quantile and geology as indicated in fig 7 the urbanisation contribution is typically positive increasing river discharge since all the urban coefficient medians as shown above each boxplot for all the seasons and flow quantiles are greater than zero among all the 20 boxplots 4 seasons 5 flow quantiles there are 16 in which about 75 or more of the cases show positive effects but for seasonal maximum flow approximately 50 of the cases show a positive effect and about 50 show a negative effect in winter spring and summer this suggests that the contribution of urbanisation is significantly stronger for changes in low flows and average flows than it is for seasonal maximum flows the positive urbanisation effect is likely driven by the creation of impervious surfaces e g streets and pavements and constructed drainage systems which result in losses of infiltration and faster runoff response to rainfall thus increasing runoff rate and volume e g fletcher et al 2013 decreasing effects were also detected in a much smaller number of catchments namely the pymmes brook at edmonton silver street site 38022 and the ver at hansteads site 39014 these decreases may be due to the offsetting effect of groundwater use in these two catchments as documented by british geological survey 2022 who note that sometimes river water may seep down to recharge groundwater it is however impossible to document all the water uses in every catchment so here we provide suggestions rather than definitive explanations the median and standard deviation of the urban coefficients across the 12 sites for each flow quantile and season are presented in table 3 our results show that a 1 increase in urban land cover is associated with 1 7 2 2 increase in low flow 0 8 2 5 increase in median flow 0 8 1 9 increase in mean flow 0 5 2 0 increase in high flow and 0 0 9 increase in seasonal maximum flow depending on season the increasing effect of urbanisation on streamflow non stationarity is stronger in the summer rather than in the winter and is stronger for low flow rather than high flow as mentioned earlier this may be due to the relatively lower flow volume in summer or at low flow conditions which leads to a proportionately larger effect additionally one potential explanation for the greater contribution of urbanisation to streamflow in the summer may be the greater likelihood of intense convective storms over urban land during the summer months which may amplify urban runoff li et al 2020 areas with fast urban expansion rates may exhibit stronger increases in heavy precipitation yu et al 2022 and in the uk intense convective rainfall tends to occur in the summer months the greater contribution of urbanisation to low flow may also be due to the development of sewer systems and hard drainages associated with urbanisation which potentially cause more sewage discharge and or water imports and thus increase low flows our detected percentage change in flow quantiles is consistent with unit changes reported by anderson et al 2022 who found a 0 6 0 7 increase in mean and high flows for 1 increase in urban area using panel regression for 729 us catchments some studies have reported a higher value for example blum et al 2020 found a 3 3 increase in annual maximum flood for a 1 increase in impervious basin cover using 280 us catchments yang et al 2021 found a 3 9 increase in annual maximum discharge for a 1 increase in urban area using 757 catchments in china the variations in the magnitude may be due to the different statistical approaches anderson et al 2022 salavati et al 2016 as well as the sampling sizes and methods blum et al 2020 for low to high flows the urban signal signs of changes in river discharge that are linked to urbanisation is greatest in summer with a median increase of 2 2 4 0 1 s d for low flow 2 5 3 3 1 s d for median flow 1 9 2 6 1 s d for mean flow and 2 0 2 2 1 s d for high flow respectively for seasonal maximum flow the urban signal is greatest in autumn with a median increase of 0 9 2 7 1 s d for 1 urban increase when pooling all seasons a 1 increase in urban extent yields an increase of 1 9 2 8 1 s d for low flow 0 9 2 3 1 s d for median flow 0 9 1 9 1 s d for mean flow 1 1 2 0 1 s d for high flow and 0 5 2 2 1 s d for seasonal maximum flow our results indicate that changes in low flows due to urbanisation tend to be proportionately larger than those for higher flows although distributions of urban coefficients vary somewhat between seasons and flow quantiles these differences are not statistically significant according to the kruskal wallis and pairwise wilcoxon rank sum test table s1 and table s2 in the supplementary material given that urban percent change varies across catchments for the study time period besides the effect of a 1 increase in urbanisation as reflected by the extracted urban coefficient we also checked the total urbanisation effect on river flow changes during the entire interval in all 12 catchments the 30 year period from 1985 to 2015 based on satellite based urban percent was considered and the percentage change in discharge which is associated with urbanisation over the period was calculated using exp e 2 δ x u 1 100 where δ x u is the urban percent increase over these fixed 30 years distributions of the urbanisation effect over the 30 year period for all study catchments are expressed as percentage changes in discharge in fig 8 this includes all the seasons and all flow quantiles the same findings emerge urbanisation in recent decades is highly likely associated with an increase in discharge as indicated by the positive medians for all the distributions the increase in urban land cover over 1985 to 2015 is associated with a median increase of 5 3 10 0 in low flow 4 1 10 0 in median flow 3 9 11 4 in mean flow 2 3 9 3 in high flow and 0 2 7 6 in seasonal maximum flow across the four seasons 4 3 evaluation of the consistency and inconsistency of other drivers the changes in aic and urban coefficients in each catchment when including 1 day maximum rainfall and antecedent day maximum in the urban models m2 are shown in fig s3 and table s3 including 1 day maximum rainfall and antecedent day maximum improves the aic for seasonal maximum flow but the urban coefficients do not change significantly only a few changes are larger than 0 01 the comparisons of aic for models with q p t ap time and without q p t ap a time covariate are presented in fig s4 and fig s5 adding a time covariate for non urbanising catchments does not significantly improve model performance fig s4 only one or two catchments show a consistent effect of including a monotonically increasing variable but for urbanising catchments the proportion of catchments showing improvement is greatly increased fig s5 eight catchments show a consistent effect this evaluation confirms that in our urbanising catchments there is a monotonic time varying variable affecting flow i e urbanisation whereas in our non urbanising catchment there is not i e increasing urbanisation rainfall intensity or some other unspecified drivers 4 4 assessment of catchment variation we also investigated various factors that could be modulating the contribution of urbanisation to river discharge non stationarity including baseflow bfi drainage area km2 total urban change urban extent bedrock permeability and water abstraction m3 linear regressions between the urban coefficients and each factor as well as the corresponding r2 and p value were used to assess the significance of contributions we first consider all 12 sites pooled together irrespective of the statistical significance of the individual urbanisation coefficients within each gamlss model we find no clear association between urban coefficients versus bfi urban change or water abstraction and the associations with these three factors remain statistically insignificant if we only consider the sites with significant coefficients in contrast results indicate a typically negative association between the urban regression coefficients and the urban extent in each catchment in all seasons fig 9 the regressions are significant only for some seasons and flow quantiles based on the p values this finding suggests that catchments that are less urbanised to begin with might be proportionately more sensitive to urbanisation effects on river discharge changes the high sensitivity in less urbanised catchments suggests that the contribution of urbanisation to streamflow non stationarity may be non linear i e as the degree of urbanisation increases its impacts on runoff generation processes may potentially slow down the reason for nonlinearity are not known but it could be that other effects e g greater urban heat island effect or greater evaporation are more prominent beyond certain levels of urbanisation for example the bedford ouse at roxton site 33039 is a less urbanised catchment 8 2 in 1990 and yields increases to low flow of 6 7 median flow of 4 3 high flow of 1 8 mean flow of 3 1 and seasonal maximum flow by 0 7 per 1 increase in urban area all seasons combined in contrast pymmes brook at edmonton silver street site 38022 is a heavily urbanised catchment 72 5 in 1990 where urbanisation is estimated to decrease low flow by 2 4 median flow by 2 3 high flow by 0 8 mean flow by 1 7 and seasonal maximum flow by 1 for a 1 increase in urban area hence the magnitude of the urban contribution tends to be large in the less urbanised catchment 33039 compared with highly urbanised catchment 38022 another possible reason for the differences in urban contributions may be the location and distribution of the urbanised areas in the less urbanised bedford ouse catchment where the contribution is large for instance urban area are mainly located in upstream and middle stream areas of the catchment which may be hydrologically more sensitive to land use change impacts as receiving and routing water flows in contrast in the highly urbanised pymmes brook catchment where the urban contribution is less urban land extends almost everywhere in the catchment including both the upstream and downstream areas if we consider only catchments with significant urban coefficients at p 0 05 significantly different from zero fig s6 the relationship between urban extent and urban coefficients becomes even stronger as indicated by the improved r2 and p values although the sample size is evidently much smaller we also find a negative association between the urban coefficients and the percentage of high permeability bedrock fig 10 the link is highly significant for low and median flows p 0 05 across all seasons but becomes less significant for high flows this finding suggests that urbanisation tends to increase flow most in catchments with low bedrock permeability likely because such strata slow the infiltration process and thus increase runoff for instance we compare the bedford ouse at roxton site 33039 high permeability bedrock 6 7 see above paragraph with the upper lee at water hall site 38018 high permeability bedrock 88 4 for the upper lee a 1 increase in urban extent is estimated to increase low flow by 0 2 median flow by 0 5 high flow by 0 7 mean flow by 0 5 and seasonal maximum flow by 0 9 on average hence the increases in discharge in the highly permeable upper lee are much smaller than in the bedford ouse across all quantiles overall the effect of bedrock permeability is stronger in summer rather than in winter similarly we find positive associations between the urban coefficients and drainage area fig s7 but these are significant only for some flow quantiles in autumn and summer the significance of the association remains similar if we include only the sites with statistically significant p 0 05 urban coefficients fig s8 this suggests that greater urban contributions to changes in river discharge are found in larger catchments albeit influenced by a few outliers it is possible that the contribution of urbanisation becomes more noticeable once an absolute threshold of surface area or urbanised land is reached we take the bedford ouse at roxton site 33039 again as an example since it is the largest among our study catchments drainage area 1660 km2 and compare it with a small catchment canons brook at elizabeth way site 38007 drainage area 21 km2 in the canons brook a 1 increase in urban area on average leads to 0 3 decrease in low flow 0 1 decrease in median flow 0 7 increase in high flow 0 2 increase in mean flow and 0 5 increase in seasonal maximum flow across different seasons in other words the magnitude of change is smaller than in the larger bedford ouse catchment 5 study limitations here we employ daily discharge records to assess the contribution of urbanisation to non stationary river flows for high flows the impacts may differ if we use instantaneous maximum flow rather than mean daily flow but we employ daily flow for consistency across quantiles we also employ a statistical approach in which monotonically increasing predictors such as urbanisation may inadvertently reflect the impact of other drivers within a catchment such as changes in rainfall intensity or gradual monotonic increases in flow abstraction augmentation over time for instance it is possible that increases in low flows in a catchment may be driven by imported effluent flows it is important to recognise that although statistical methods are powerful tools for detecting signals in observational data one can never be entirely sure of the drivers as with a physics based model to counter such weaknesses we developed a procedure for assessing the consistency inconsistency of predictors further recent and future urbanisation might have different effects on discharge than historic urbanisation for instance due to greater uptake of sustainable drainage systems or higher density urban development also other factors such as river management e g channelization river bed paving geomorphological differences among the catchments e g basin shape channel network density and temporal changes in transport and deposition of sediment leading to changes in channel width depth and slope e g slater et al 2019 may have certain impacts on river discharge as well as our ability to reliably measure discharge 6 conclusions in this study we investigated the contribution of changes in urban area to river discharge trends for a representative sample of uk catchments covering different flow quantiles and seasons using a stringent set of criteria 12 catchments were selected based on the completeness of their observed data records absence of major human influences significant changes in flow and changes in urban land cover two statistical models were developed at each site to estimate relationships between river flow precipitation temperature and antecedent rainfall for specified flow quantiles and seasons one model without and one with urbanisation as a predictor variable model coefficients for urbanisation were then extracted from urban models to quantify river flow quantile sensitivity to urban area results show that the model performance is generally improved in urban catchments when urbanisation is included as a covariate suggesting that non stationary river discharge is partly driven by growing urban areas the improvement is more significant for low median and mean flow relative to high flow and there are no significant differences between seasons we find urbanisation is more likely to be associated with increases than decreases of river discharge across flow quantiles and seasons however the magnitude of the association varies considerably across catchments depending on season flow quantiles and geology a unit 1 increase in urban land cover is associated with 1 9 2 8 1 s d increase in low flow 0 9 2 3 1 s d increase in median flow 0 9 1 9 1 s d increase in mean flow 1 1 2 0 1 s d increase in high flow and 0 5 2 2 1 s d increase in seasonal maximum flow across different seasons on average the contribution of urbanisation tends to be proportionately larger for low flows than the highest flows which implies that urbanisation has most significant impacts on changes in non flood flows results also indicate a greater sensitivity of river flow to urbanisation in those catchments with low initial urban extent and in catchments with less area underlain by high permeability bedrock overall our results suggest that for urbanising catchments historical river flow models and future river flow projections are unlikely to be robust if they are only driven by meteorological inputs our findings also highlight that one must be particularly cautious when estimating or projecting future river flow in catchments that are less urbanised and likely to witness rapid urbanisation

2962,urbanisation is a recognized driver of changes in catchment river flow however quantifying the urban influence remains a major challenge due to the brevity of land cover records and the challenge of isolating this signal from other drivers this study assesses the contribution of urbanisation to changes in river discharge across different seasons and quantiles low median high mean and peak flows twelve catchments 21 1660 km2 are selected after screening all gauged uk catchments for minimal human influences other than significant changes in urban land cover generalized additive models for location scale and shape gamlss are developed using long 40 63 years historical records of precipitation temperature urban land cover and daily river discharge m3 s model coefficients reveal that increased urban area is associated with a rise in discharge across all flow quantiles and seasons on average and the contribution of urbanisation to non stationarity is stronger for low flows and average flows than it is for high flows for every 1 increase in urban land cover there is an associated increase in the median of 1 9 2 8 1 s d for low flow 0 9 2 3 1 s d for median flow 0 9 1 9 1 s d for mean flow 1 1 2 0 1 s d for high flow and 0 5 2 2 1 s d for seasonal maximum flow across seasons the urbanisation flow signal tends to be greatest in catchments with less initial urban extent and low bedrock permeability keywords urbanisation river flow non stationary urban extent statistical modelling attribution data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction historical trends in both mean and peak river flow in the uk broadly reveal increases in the northwest and a mix of increases and decreases in the southeast hannaford et al 2021 hannaford and buys 2012 hannaford and marsh 2006 hannaford and marsh 2008 harrigan et al 2018 prosdocimi et al 2014 these regional variations differ from river flow projections of mean and peak flow for coming decades based on the latest uk climate projections ukcp outlooks suggest increases for western britain with some decreases in central and eastern england and eastern scotland kay 2021 lane et al 2021 yet historical and projected climate show similar trends since 1960 the uk has warmed by about 0 2 c per decade and with 6 increase in annual average precipitation mcsweeney et al 2009 kendon et al 2020 by the 2060s the country is expected to witness 1 2 1 8 c further warming and 1 8 7 2 increase in annual precipitation depending on the emission scenario lowe et al 2018 mcsweeney et al 2009 thus the spatial discrepancy in observed and projected river flow trends as well as the heterogeneity of local trends raises the question of whether future climate driven river flow projection should be taken at face value or whether we may be missing some key drivers of non stationary river flow slater et al 2021 wilby et al 2008 local catchment specific drivers may also play an important role such as urbanisation dawson et al 2006 faulkner et al 2020 hannaford et al 2021 quantifying the effect of urbanisation on river flow is not straightforward some authors have found that urbanisation increases flows as impervious land cover leads to reduced infiltration increased runoff volume as well as shortened runoff response time blum et al 2020 cuo 2016 de niel and willems 2019 prosdocimi et al 2015 teuling et al 2019 anderson et al 2022 various modelling approaches have been applied for example prosdocimi et al 2015 employed point process models in a paired catchment study that included one urbanised catchment and a nearby rural catchment with similar hydrological characteristics and detected an increase in high flows due to urbanisation especially in summer blum et al 2020 employed panel regression models with a large sample of us catchments and estimated that a 1 increase in urban cover leads to on average 3 3 increase in annual maximum floods de niel and willems 2019 fitted statistical regression models to 29 catchments in belgium and found the land cover effect on peak flows varies signicantly across catchments depending on soil textures and slopes they estimated that a 1 increase in urban area could cause up to a 5 increase in peak flows in steep catchments with a high percentage of loamic soils by applying conceptual rainfall runoff models to 95 catchments in the rhine basin hundecha and bárdossy 2004 found that urbanisation increased summer peak flows and also caused a modest rise in winter peak flows using distributional regression models in 290 catchments in the us midwest slater and villarini 2017 found that a 10 increase in population density a proxy for urbanisation was associated with more than a 20 increase in median streamflow in summer some studies report contrary responses in catchments with specific characteristics using linear mixed effects modelling of 19 watersheds in central arizona usa mcphillips et al 2019 found that in arid catchments urbanisation decreases flood flashiness flow variability and hydrograph rise and fall rates the decreasing effects were explained in terms of increased retention by engineered basins of water during storm events instead of flowing directly to the river others suggest that urbanisation effects on river flow or hydrologic response are inconsistent or difficult to detect this could reflect differences in the methods applied e g anderson et al 2022 or the difficulty in quantifying urbanisation typically quantified as the catchment urban area fraction or the mean areal imperviousness such urbanisation metrics may not sufficiently explain the location distribution and character of impervious cover within a given catchment salavati et al 2016 like tolstoy s unhappy families every urban catchment is urbanised in its own way for example impervious areas that drain runoff to pervious surfaces may have less effect on river flow than impervious areas that are directly connected to the drainage system jacobson 2011 vesuviano and miller 2019 found that in an urban catchment in swindon uk the effect of draining to pervious surfaces could even reduce the peak flows to below what would be expected for a rural catchment other reasons may be that it is difficult to isolate the signal of urbanisation from other drivers e g climate change and other headwater land cover changes or from background hydrologic noise e g the imports and exports of sewage water across catchment boundaries upstream river regulation and ground and surface water abstraction beyond uncertainties in the underlying river flow observations wilby et al 2017 the river flow response can differ significantly between catchments due to poorly observed confounding factors such as variable soil composition subsurface geology infrastructure systems and water resources management strategies steinschneider et al 2013 furthermore absence of an urban signal may be due to the offsetting influence of other factors for instance the positive effects of urbanisation on runoff may become insignificant due to flood reduction measures such as sustainable urban drainage systems and flood attenuation features although various studies have shown that urbanisation may alter river flow distributions the role of catchment properties combined with rates of urbanisation are poorly understood this paper is the first to quantify and compare the contribution of urbanisation to trends in river discharge using carefully selected catchments across the uk with long median 58 years observed records under different flow quantiles and seasons we ask to what extent do urbanisation signatures manifest differentially by 1 river flow quantiles low to high flows 2 season 3 underlying geology and flow regime in summary we explore the sensitivity of the urban signature to flow quantile season and catchment properties 2 study catchments and data 2 1 selection of study catchments the study catchments were selected from the national river flow archive nrfa https nrfa ceh ac uk the primary source of hydrometric information in the uk the total number of nrfa stations available is 1598 after applying strict filtering criteria see fig 1 a sub set of 12 eligible sites were retained for detailed investigation filtering was applied to identify only sites where an urban influence might be objectively detectable by excluding sites with 1 less than 90 of daily discharge values in each year during the period 1985 2015 coinciding with the initial period with satellite observations of urbanisation 2 upstream storage or impounding reservoirs as denoted by nrfa factors affecting runoff far codes which indicate artificial influences within the catchment that might alter the natural runoff 3 stationary flood series on the basis that it only makes sense to detect a non stationary driver if there is non stationarity in the underlying time series based on the change point and expert assessment compiled by faulkner et al 2021 sites identified as suitable by faulkner et al 2021 are those with non stationary annual maximum flow amax and where the data quality is sufficient to detect non stationarity sufficient data quality means the length of flow data the percentage of missing data and the consistency of the data are good enough to be used in statistical tests it is worth noting that although the flood series are non stationary other flow quantiles may not be 4 less than 5 urban cover change during the study period 40 63 years depending on the length of the observed river discharge record the rationale being that a minimum amount of change in the predictor variable is necessary for robust statistical detection 5 suspect values for urban data which had a 30 discrepancy between extracted satellite based urban percent from liu et al 2020 compared with the urban extent from nrfa for the year 1990 and camels gb for the year 2015 as well as one site with an unrealistic decrease in the reconstructed urban extent time series using household based estimates we retained only the sites with non stationary streamflow to objectively quantify the contribution of urbanisation to observed streamflow trends across all the flow quantiles from low to high if instead the aim was to assess whether urbanization has a detectable effect on streamflow we might have included sites with stationary flood series however there are only 4 additional stationary sites that meet the criteria good flow record absence of major human influence such as reservoirs presence of significant urban land change and reliable urban data sites 17003 19001 27030 and 28026 sites that have experienced significant urbanisation but show stationary flow are very likely have other drivers or other artificial influences that affect river flow for instance the 4 additional stationary sites all reported either public water supply abstraction industrial and or agricultural abstraction or groundwater abstraction nrfa 2022 stationary sites were therefore excluded to focus on the contribution of urbanisation to flow non stationarity this catchment selection workflow is also theoretically applicable to other global catchments through adapting each criterion based on available datasets for example by employing alternative data sources as a comparison an equal number of non urbanising catchments 12 which have less than 2 5 urban change over the study period were also selected using the same site selection procedure as described above but changing only the urban change criterion from more than 5 to less than 2 5 after applying all the filtering steps the locations of the short listed 12 urbanising catchments and 12 non urbanising catchments are presented in fig 2 and the summary of urbanising catchments is in table 1 most of the urban sites are near large cities that have experienced rapid urbanisation over recent decades including london and birmingham drainage areas range between 21 km2 and 1660 km2 mean annual precipitation from 604 mm to 868 mm and mean daily discharge varies between 0 17 m3 s to 11 53 m3 s land cover according to the nrfa includes woodland 3 9 to 41 7 of catchment area arable horticultural 3 7 to 69 grassland 13 7 to 29 7 heath bog 0 to 2 8 and urban extent 8 2 to 72 5 the catchments are underlain by various geological and superficial deposits the strata span high e g fissured aquifer for bedrock sand and gravel for superficial deposits low e g impermeable rock for bedrock clay and peat for superficial deposits and mixed permeability e g confined aquifer for bedrock brickearth and alluvium for superficial deposits nrfa 2022 2 2 data collection and processing daily flow data were retrieved for the selected catchments using the rnrfa r package vitolo et al 2016 catchment shapefiles were automatically extracted from camels gb coxon et al 2020 or downloaded from the nrfa if the catchment was not included in camels gb catchment averaged daily precipitation 1950 to 2020 and monthly mean temperature 1884 to 2020 were extracted from the met office hadley centre for climate science and services haduk grid with 5 km resolution hollis et al 2019 annual urban land cover percent during 1985 to 2015 was based on satellite derived 30 m resolution global urban maps liu et al 2020 urban extent for the year 1990 from the nrfa weighted sum of urban and suburban land cover map classes and urban extent for the year 2015 from camels gb coxon et al 2020 percentage of urban and suburban extent based on the land cover map 2015 were also obtained as references to assess the extracted urban time series to reconstruct urban extent prior to 1985 time series of total households from census data available from 1951 to 2011 were downloaded and employed as a proxy for urban percent great britain historical gis project 2017 since census data are collected based on administrative units the total households from the local authority covering the main course of the river were used for each catchment a linear scaling method shrestha et al 2017 was used to relate household data to the satellite urban area series we computed the conversion factor as shown in table 1 between the extracted 30 m resolution urban percent time series red line in fig 3 and the household data over the period 1985 2011 we applied the same conversion factor to the raw household data then employed the converted household data blue line in fig 3 to reconstruct the urban percent time series back to 1951 under the assumption that pre 1985 and post 1985 periods have the same developed area associated with each household the final extended urban percent time series is a blend of the household based estimates for 1951 1984 with the satellite based urban percent for 1985 2015 figs 2 3 to investigate whether other factors may modulate the contribution of urbanization to observed non stationarity on river discharge catchment attributes such as drainage area base flow index bfi factors affecting runoff far urban extent land cover and geology data were obtained from the nrfa catalogue nrfa 2022 detailed water import export information at the catchment level including the fully licenced quantity of surface water abstraction groundwater abstraction and discharge were obtained from environment agency environment agency 2021 3 methodology 3 1 model development and performance evaluation generalized additive models for location scale and shape gamlss were used to quantify the contribution of urbanisation to trends in river discharge gamlss were introduced by rigby and stasinopoulos 2005 and are flexible semiparametric regression models they allow any parametric distribution for the response variable and allow a variety of additive terms for the distribution parameters which can be modelled as linear non linear or non parametric smooth functions of the explanatory variables stasinopoulos and rigby 2007 we implemented gamlss using the gamlss r package stasinopoulos et al 2017 two gamlss models were developed at each site to estimate relationships between the river flow and the predictors precipitation x p temperature x t antecedent precipitation x ap and urbanisation area x u for different seasons and flow quantiles variable x p is the seasonal precipitation total mm computed as catchment averages from daily precipitation observations x ap is the accumulated catchment average precipitation mm for the previous season employed as an indicator of soil moisture initial conditions for example if the predictand is summer low flow then x p is the sum of precipitation from june to august every year and x ap is the sum of precipitation for the previous season march to may variable x t is seasonal catchment average temperature c and x u is urban land cover for the catchments on an annual basis the gamma distribution which has been frequently employed for streamflow modelling in previous studies prekopa and szantai 1978 yue 2001 yue et al 2001 was used for the response variable river flow with two parameters i e the location parameter μ which defines the location of the distribution and the scale parameter σ which defines its statistical dispersion for simplicity μ is linearly dependent on the predictors through a logarithmic function whereas σ is held constant following slater and villarini 2018 since varying this parameter over time does not systematically improve the fits of the gamlss models for river discharge villarini and strong 2014 the model formulations are shown in table 2 model 1 m1 is without urbanisation whereas model 2 m2 includes urbanisation notations a b c d and e are regression coefficients for brevity m1 is referred as q p t ap and m2 is referred as q p t ap u where q stands for river discharge and p t ap and u correspond to the predictors x p x t x ap and x u respectively the seasons are spring march april may summer june july august autumn september october november and winter december january february the analysed river discharge quantiles are low flow 10th percentile denoted by q 0 1 median flow 50th percentile denoted by q 0 5 high flow 90th percentile denoted by q 0 9 mean flow denoted by q mean and seasonal maximum flow denoted by q max calculated from daily discharge records for every season and year the akaike information criterion aic and worm plots were used to assess the goodness of fit of the gamlss models the formula of aic is defined as eq 1 where k is the number of model parameters and l is the maximum value of the log likelihood estimate akaike 1974 lower aic indicates a better model fit worm plots are detrended qq plots of the model residuals see fig s1 and fig s2 in supplementary material for a well fitted model the dots should be close to the central horizontal line and 95 of them distributed between the upper and lower curve stasinopoulos et al 2017 1 aic 2 k 2 l n l 3 2 analysis of urbanisation coefficients the coefficients for urbanisation e 2 from m2 in table 2 which describe the change in discharge for every unit change in urban area were extracted for further analysis using the regression model we assess the effect of a unit increase in the predictor in this case urban land cover on the predictand streamflow this approach allows a straightforward comparison of the effect of a unit 1 increase in urbanisation on streamflow across different locations given that our model is a logarithm model as shown in table 2 the urbanisation coefficients were then transformed to be expressed as percentage values using exp e 2 1 100 to give the percentage change in discharge for every one percent change in urbanisation the p values associated with the urbanisation coefficients were also analysed to assess their statistical significance if the p value is less than the significance level p 0 05 then it implies that the urban covariate has a statistically significant relationship with river discharge in the model and the urbanisation coefficient is significantly different from zero effects of catchment properties e g urban extent drainage area and bedrock permeability were analysed by fitting a linear regression between the extracted urbanisation coefficients and each catchment property across different flow quantiles and seasons the regression p value and coefficient of determination r2 show the significance of these relationships 3 3 effects of other model predictors additionally we assessed the effect of adding other predictors such as 1 day maximum rainfall and antecedent day maximum on the model fit and coefficients we do so because such predictors may better describe high flows q max than seasonal precipitation total x p or accumulated catchment average precipitation for the previous season x ap changes in aic and urban coefficients were analysed after including 1 day maximum rainfall and antecedent day maximum as additional predictors in the urban models m2 previous work has highlighted that beyond proving evidence of the consistency of specific drivers e g discharge change consistent with urbanisation change robust hydrological attribution also requires testing of inconsistency i e when flow change is inconsistent with changes in other drivers merz et al 2012 such evidence is particularly important in the case of statistical modelling where a monotonically increasing variable such as urbanisation or time may inadvertently track other monotonically increasing catchment drivers of river flows such as greenhouse gas concentrations or storm intensity therefore to assess the consistency inconsistency of an urban effect on river flow we also tested the effects of adding time as an additional covariate representative of any monotonically increasing driver at non urbanising sites two models q p t ap q p t ap time were fitted for both 12 urbanising and 12 non urbanising catchments for each season where the time covariate is simply the year of record the aic values for models with and without time covariate were compared to assess the effect of including a monotonically increasing covariate on model performance 4 results and discussions 4 1 performance of the urban models model fits for an exemplar catchment blackwater at swallowfield are shown in fig 4 low flow across all the seasons and fig 5 autumn season across different flow quantiles for the blackwater aic values for urban models m2 are much lower than for models without urbanisation m1 for low flow across all seasons e g spring low flow aic m2 5 87 aic m1 55 36 the model fits are also much better in autumn across low flow median flow and mean flow fig 5 this indicates that urban models perform significantly better in simulating historical flow for these quantiles the fits are satisfactory since the observations closely follow the fitted distribution and are mostly well within the 5th 95th percentiles the goodness of fit is also indicated by worm plots see figs s1 and s2 comparison between m1 and m2 for this catchment indicates that urbanisation is associated with river discharge increase figs 4 and 5 extracted coefficients indicate that a 1 increase in urban extent increases the low median high mean and seasonal maximum discharge by 3 5 2 6 1 6 2 0 and 1 0 respectively in autumn fig 5 the strongest effect is seen for the low flows whereby a 1 increase in urban extent increases discharge by 3 5 3 4 4 3 and 2 5 in autumn spring summer and winter seasons respectively fig 4 the increasing effect tends to be more significant for low flow and for the summer season one possible explanation for the greater contribution of urbanisation to low flow versus high flow may be that the absolute effect i e the magnitude of change in streamflow caused by urbanization is proportionately larger relative to the total streamflow when flows are low low flow tends to occur during the summer months when there is less rain and more evapotranspiration due to the higher temperature burn et al 2008 however we cannot discount that there may be another explanation sewer systems and hard drainage networks are usually developed as part of the urbanisation process thus discharge from sewage works may also play a role in increasing low flows smakhtin 2001 in other words it is not impossible that urbanisation may be acting as a proxy for more sewage discharge and or water imports across catchment boundaries which would have a proportionately larger effect on low flow volumes comparisons of aic values between the two models m1 model without urbanisation and m2 model with urbanisation across different seasons and flow quantiles for all the sites are shown in fig 6 the majority of m2 aic values are lower than m1 in some cases m1 shows a better aic but the aic differences between m1 and m2 are very low less than 2 differences of less than 2 imply that neither model is significantly better than the other burnham and anderson 1998 overall the aic comparisons indicate that the urban model m2 performs better the model fits are improved when urban percent is included as a covariate and the colour gradient shows the improvement is more significant for low flow median flow and mean flow across different seasons the worm plots indicate the m2 fits for the 12 sites are adequate as the dots are all near the red horizontal line and lie between the upper and lower dotted curves which denote 95 confidence intervals we show example worm plots for the blackwater at swallowfield 39007 in fig s1 and fig s2 but not all sites 4 seasons 5 flow quantiles 13 sites 4 2 assessment of the contribution of urbanisation to non stationarity distributions of the transformed urban coefficients expressed as percentages for different seasons and flow quantiles are presented in fig 7 we find that the magnitude of the contribution of urbanisation to river discharge non stationarity varies considerably by catchment depending on season flow quantile and geology as indicated in fig 7 the urbanisation contribution is typically positive increasing river discharge since all the urban coefficient medians as shown above each boxplot for all the seasons and flow quantiles are greater than zero among all the 20 boxplots 4 seasons 5 flow quantiles there are 16 in which about 75 or more of the cases show positive effects but for seasonal maximum flow approximately 50 of the cases show a positive effect and about 50 show a negative effect in winter spring and summer this suggests that the contribution of urbanisation is significantly stronger for changes in low flows and average flows than it is for seasonal maximum flows the positive urbanisation effect is likely driven by the creation of impervious surfaces e g streets and pavements and constructed drainage systems which result in losses of infiltration and faster runoff response to rainfall thus increasing runoff rate and volume e g fletcher et al 2013 decreasing effects were also detected in a much smaller number of catchments namely the pymmes brook at edmonton silver street site 38022 and the ver at hansteads site 39014 these decreases may be due to the offsetting effect of groundwater use in these two catchments as documented by british geological survey 2022 who note that sometimes river water may seep down to recharge groundwater it is however impossible to document all the water uses in every catchment so here we provide suggestions rather than definitive explanations the median and standard deviation of the urban coefficients across the 12 sites for each flow quantile and season are presented in table 3 our results show that a 1 increase in urban land cover is associated with 1 7 2 2 increase in low flow 0 8 2 5 increase in median flow 0 8 1 9 increase in mean flow 0 5 2 0 increase in high flow and 0 0 9 increase in seasonal maximum flow depending on season the increasing effect of urbanisation on streamflow non stationarity is stronger in the summer rather than in the winter and is stronger for low flow rather than high flow as mentioned earlier this may be due to the relatively lower flow volume in summer or at low flow conditions which leads to a proportionately larger effect additionally one potential explanation for the greater contribution of urbanisation to streamflow in the summer may be the greater likelihood of intense convective storms over urban land during the summer months which may amplify urban runoff li et al 2020 areas with fast urban expansion rates may exhibit stronger increases in heavy precipitation yu et al 2022 and in the uk intense convective rainfall tends to occur in the summer months the greater contribution of urbanisation to low flow may also be due to the development of sewer systems and hard drainages associated with urbanisation which potentially cause more sewage discharge and or water imports and thus increase low flows our detected percentage change in flow quantiles is consistent with unit changes reported by anderson et al 2022 who found a 0 6 0 7 increase in mean and high flows for 1 increase in urban area using panel regression for 729 us catchments some studies have reported a higher value for example blum et al 2020 found a 3 3 increase in annual maximum flood for a 1 increase in impervious basin cover using 280 us catchments yang et al 2021 found a 3 9 increase in annual maximum discharge for a 1 increase in urban area using 757 catchments in china the variations in the magnitude may be due to the different statistical approaches anderson et al 2022 salavati et al 2016 as well as the sampling sizes and methods blum et al 2020 for low to high flows the urban signal signs of changes in river discharge that are linked to urbanisation is greatest in summer with a median increase of 2 2 4 0 1 s d for low flow 2 5 3 3 1 s d for median flow 1 9 2 6 1 s d for mean flow and 2 0 2 2 1 s d for high flow respectively for seasonal maximum flow the urban signal is greatest in autumn with a median increase of 0 9 2 7 1 s d for 1 urban increase when pooling all seasons a 1 increase in urban extent yields an increase of 1 9 2 8 1 s d for low flow 0 9 2 3 1 s d for median flow 0 9 1 9 1 s d for mean flow 1 1 2 0 1 s d for high flow and 0 5 2 2 1 s d for seasonal maximum flow our results indicate that changes in low flows due to urbanisation tend to be proportionately larger than those for higher flows although distributions of urban coefficients vary somewhat between seasons and flow quantiles these differences are not statistically significant according to the kruskal wallis and pairwise wilcoxon rank sum test table s1 and table s2 in the supplementary material given that urban percent change varies across catchments for the study time period besides the effect of a 1 increase in urbanisation as reflected by the extracted urban coefficient we also checked the total urbanisation effect on river flow changes during the entire interval in all 12 catchments the 30 year period from 1985 to 2015 based on satellite based urban percent was considered and the percentage change in discharge which is associated with urbanisation over the period was calculated using exp e 2 δ x u 1 100 where δ x u is the urban percent increase over these fixed 30 years distributions of the urbanisation effect over the 30 year period for all study catchments are expressed as percentage changes in discharge in fig 8 this includes all the seasons and all flow quantiles the same findings emerge urbanisation in recent decades is highly likely associated with an increase in discharge as indicated by the positive medians for all the distributions the increase in urban land cover over 1985 to 2015 is associated with a median increase of 5 3 10 0 in low flow 4 1 10 0 in median flow 3 9 11 4 in mean flow 2 3 9 3 in high flow and 0 2 7 6 in seasonal maximum flow across the four seasons 4 3 evaluation of the consistency and inconsistency of other drivers the changes in aic and urban coefficients in each catchment when including 1 day maximum rainfall and antecedent day maximum in the urban models m2 are shown in fig s3 and table s3 including 1 day maximum rainfall and antecedent day maximum improves the aic for seasonal maximum flow but the urban coefficients do not change significantly only a few changes are larger than 0 01 the comparisons of aic for models with q p t ap time and without q p t ap a time covariate are presented in fig s4 and fig s5 adding a time covariate for non urbanising catchments does not significantly improve model performance fig s4 only one or two catchments show a consistent effect of including a monotonically increasing variable but for urbanising catchments the proportion of catchments showing improvement is greatly increased fig s5 eight catchments show a consistent effect this evaluation confirms that in our urbanising catchments there is a monotonic time varying variable affecting flow i e urbanisation whereas in our non urbanising catchment there is not i e increasing urbanisation rainfall intensity or some other unspecified drivers 4 4 assessment of catchment variation we also investigated various factors that could be modulating the contribution of urbanisation to river discharge non stationarity including baseflow bfi drainage area km2 total urban change urban extent bedrock permeability and water abstraction m3 linear regressions between the urban coefficients and each factor as well as the corresponding r2 and p value were used to assess the significance of contributions we first consider all 12 sites pooled together irrespective of the statistical significance of the individual urbanisation coefficients within each gamlss model we find no clear association between urban coefficients versus bfi urban change or water abstraction and the associations with these three factors remain statistically insignificant if we only consider the sites with significant coefficients in contrast results indicate a typically negative association between the urban regression coefficients and the urban extent in each catchment in all seasons fig 9 the regressions are significant only for some seasons and flow quantiles based on the p values this finding suggests that catchments that are less urbanised to begin with might be proportionately more sensitive to urbanisation effects on river discharge changes the high sensitivity in less urbanised catchments suggests that the contribution of urbanisation to streamflow non stationarity may be non linear i e as the degree of urbanisation increases its impacts on runoff generation processes may potentially slow down the reason for nonlinearity are not known but it could be that other effects e g greater urban heat island effect or greater evaporation are more prominent beyond certain levels of urbanisation for example the bedford ouse at roxton site 33039 is a less urbanised catchment 8 2 in 1990 and yields increases to low flow of 6 7 median flow of 4 3 high flow of 1 8 mean flow of 3 1 and seasonal maximum flow by 0 7 per 1 increase in urban area all seasons combined in contrast pymmes brook at edmonton silver street site 38022 is a heavily urbanised catchment 72 5 in 1990 where urbanisation is estimated to decrease low flow by 2 4 median flow by 2 3 high flow by 0 8 mean flow by 1 7 and seasonal maximum flow by 1 for a 1 increase in urban area hence the magnitude of the urban contribution tends to be large in the less urbanised catchment 33039 compared with highly urbanised catchment 38022 another possible reason for the differences in urban contributions may be the location and distribution of the urbanised areas in the less urbanised bedford ouse catchment where the contribution is large for instance urban area are mainly located in upstream and middle stream areas of the catchment which may be hydrologically more sensitive to land use change impacts as receiving and routing water flows in contrast in the highly urbanised pymmes brook catchment where the urban contribution is less urban land extends almost everywhere in the catchment including both the upstream and downstream areas if we consider only catchments with significant urban coefficients at p 0 05 significantly different from zero fig s6 the relationship between urban extent and urban coefficients becomes even stronger as indicated by the improved r2 and p values although the sample size is evidently much smaller we also find a negative association between the urban coefficients and the percentage of high permeability bedrock fig 10 the link is highly significant for low and median flows p 0 05 across all seasons but becomes less significant for high flows this finding suggests that urbanisation tends to increase flow most in catchments with low bedrock permeability likely because such strata slow the infiltration process and thus increase runoff for instance we compare the bedford ouse at roxton site 33039 high permeability bedrock 6 7 see above paragraph with the upper lee at water hall site 38018 high permeability bedrock 88 4 for the upper lee a 1 increase in urban extent is estimated to increase low flow by 0 2 median flow by 0 5 high flow by 0 7 mean flow by 0 5 and seasonal maximum flow by 0 9 on average hence the increases in discharge in the highly permeable upper lee are much smaller than in the bedford ouse across all quantiles overall the effect of bedrock permeability is stronger in summer rather than in winter similarly we find positive associations between the urban coefficients and drainage area fig s7 but these are significant only for some flow quantiles in autumn and summer the significance of the association remains similar if we include only the sites with statistically significant p 0 05 urban coefficients fig s8 this suggests that greater urban contributions to changes in river discharge are found in larger catchments albeit influenced by a few outliers it is possible that the contribution of urbanisation becomes more noticeable once an absolute threshold of surface area or urbanised land is reached we take the bedford ouse at roxton site 33039 again as an example since it is the largest among our study catchments drainage area 1660 km2 and compare it with a small catchment canons brook at elizabeth way site 38007 drainage area 21 km2 in the canons brook a 1 increase in urban area on average leads to 0 3 decrease in low flow 0 1 decrease in median flow 0 7 increase in high flow 0 2 increase in mean flow and 0 5 increase in seasonal maximum flow across different seasons in other words the magnitude of change is smaller than in the larger bedford ouse catchment 5 study limitations here we employ daily discharge records to assess the contribution of urbanisation to non stationary river flows for high flows the impacts may differ if we use instantaneous maximum flow rather than mean daily flow but we employ daily flow for consistency across quantiles we also employ a statistical approach in which monotonically increasing predictors such as urbanisation may inadvertently reflect the impact of other drivers within a catchment such as changes in rainfall intensity or gradual monotonic increases in flow abstraction augmentation over time for instance it is possible that increases in low flows in a catchment may be driven by imported effluent flows it is important to recognise that although statistical methods are powerful tools for detecting signals in observational data one can never be entirely sure of the drivers as with a physics based model to counter such weaknesses we developed a procedure for assessing the consistency inconsistency of predictors further recent and future urbanisation might have different effects on discharge than historic urbanisation for instance due to greater uptake of sustainable drainage systems or higher density urban development also other factors such as river management e g channelization river bed paving geomorphological differences among the catchments e g basin shape channel network density and temporal changes in transport and deposition of sediment leading to changes in channel width depth and slope e g slater et al 2019 may have certain impacts on river discharge as well as our ability to reliably measure discharge 6 conclusions in this study we investigated the contribution of changes in urban area to river discharge trends for a representative sample of uk catchments covering different flow quantiles and seasons using a stringent set of criteria 12 catchments were selected based on the completeness of their observed data records absence of major human influences significant changes in flow and changes in urban land cover two statistical models were developed at each site to estimate relationships between river flow precipitation temperature and antecedent rainfall for specified flow quantiles and seasons one model without and one with urbanisation as a predictor variable model coefficients for urbanisation were then extracted from urban models to quantify river flow quantile sensitivity to urban area results show that the model performance is generally improved in urban catchments when urbanisation is included as a covariate suggesting that non stationary river discharge is partly driven by growing urban areas the improvement is more significant for low median and mean flow relative to high flow and there are no significant differences between seasons we find urbanisation is more likely to be associated with increases than decreases of river discharge across flow quantiles and seasons however the magnitude of the association varies considerably across catchments depending on season flow quantiles and geology a unit 1 increase in urban land cover is associated with 1 9 2 8 1 s d increase in low flow 0 9 2 3 1 s d increase in median flow 0 9 1 9 1 s d increase in mean flow 1 1 2 0 1 s d increase in high flow and 0 5 2 2 1 s d increase in seasonal maximum flow across different seasons on average the contribution of urbanisation tends to be proportionately larger for low flows than the highest flows which implies that urbanisation has most significant impacts on changes in non flood flows results also indicate a greater sensitivity of river flow to urbanisation in those catchments with low initial urban extent and in catchments with less area underlain by high permeability bedrock overall our results suggest that for urbanising catchments historical river flow models and future river flow projections are unlikely to be robust if they are only driven by meteorological inputs our findings also highlight that one must be particularly cautious when estimating or projecting future river flow in catchments that are less urbanised and likely to witness rapid urbanisation

2963,interception loss is a crucial part of the hydrological cycle and can influence the water and energy balance between the soil surface and atmosphere fire alters forest structure and then can immediately modify hydrological factors that influence interception loss we monitored and simulated canopy rainfall partitioning responses to fire were monitored in a coniferous and broadleaved mixed forest the results showed that fire had significant impacts on the process of gross rainfall partitioning fire enhanced throughfall rate from 71 1 to 77 9 but reduced interception loss rate from 22 3 to 19 8 and reduced stemflow rate from 6 6 to 2 3 our analysis showed that the revised gash model can accurately predict interception loss and other rainfall fractions in the burned forest the fire altered the proportions of interception loss components and their sensitivity to model parameters however the dominant components of interception loss were still attributed to evaporation from the water saturated canopy during and after storms moreover the predicted interception loss was still highly sensitive to changes in canopy cover rain intensity and evaporation rate these findings provide useful information for evaluating post fire changes in forest canopy water budgets and for predicting rainfall partitioning in response to climate change keywords forest hydrology forest fire interception loss rainfall partitioning revised gash model data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction when rain falls on forest canopies a fairly large proportion is intercepted and subsequently evaporates i e interception loss and thus does not fall to the forest floor soto schönherr and iroumé 2016 interception loss is a major component of water and energy balance in forest ecosystems the remaining rainwater that reaches to the forest floor represents understory or net rainfall including throughfall and stemflow throughfall the main component of understory rainfall is the sum of free throughfall rainfall dropping through canopy gaps without touching canopy surfaces and release throughfall rainfall splashing or dripping from branches and leaves fathizadeh et al 2021 levia et al 2019 by contrast stemflow is temporarily intercepted by the canopy and subsequently flows along stems or trunks towards the ground stemflow represents a comparatively small proportion of gross rainfall compared to throughfall generally accounting for less than 10 of gross rainfall fathizadeh et al 2021 su et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 forest canopies affect water balance in forest ecosystems by intercepting storing and transferring rainwater between the forest canopy and soil fathizadeh et al 2020 and therefore forest canopies can regulate local precipitation patterns and regional climate system soto schönherr and iroumé 2016 the varied mechanisms of interception loss however are quite complex forest canopy properties including tree density livesley et al 2014 species composition pérez suárez et al 2014 zhang et al 2022 leaf area index sun et al 2022 and percent canopy cover staelens et al 2006 are all expected to control interception ability and water redistribution patterns in forest ecosystems accounting for these processes is necessary for understanding and predicting water balance in forest ecosystems considering the intensification of global warming and increasing prevalence of extreme drought the frequency intensity and size of wildfires have dramatically increased in recent decades with direct consequences for forest ecosystems feurdean et al 2017 onodera and van stan 2011 moreover prescribed fire is a widely used forest management and restoration strategy that is increasingly attracting public attention harper et al 2018 fire is a potentially transformative disturbance in forest ecosystems capable of producing drastic changes in forest canopy structure by altering canopy openness foliage volume boundary layer conductance bark absorbency and canopy water storage cansler et al 2022 onodera and van stan 2011 ueyama et al 2020 these structural changes subsequently influence the transfer storage and interception of rainwater quantifying variation in interception loss and its response to fire disturbance would enhance our understanding of canopy mediated hydrologic dynamics in the context of increasing disturbance under ongoing global change interception loss is a highly variable ecohydrological flux in forest ecosystems and is the most difficult time consuming and expensive flux to evaluate and quantify in the field muzylo et al 2009 návar 2020 soto schönherr and iroumé 2016 therefore interception loss is usually derived from other rainfall fractions and small uncertainties in any of them may produce relatively large errors in estimated interception loss dunkerley 2000 su et al 2016 scholars have proposed some models to predict interception loss and these models have been refined over time to reduce input data requirements and increase model flexibility eliades et al 2022 muzylo et al 2009 the rutter model is an accepted tool for predicting interception loss but its strict data requirements greatly limit its widespread application gash 1979 provided an analytical and rain event scale alternative simplified version of the rutter model that model not only preserves the fundamental physical processes of the rutter model but also simplifies its rigorous data requirements and complex programming processes gash 1979 gash et al 1995 and valente et al 1997 reformulated the original gash model by introducing canopy cover fraction to improve its applicability in forests with sparse canopies the revised gash model has been confirmed robust and accurate in naturally sparse forests fathizadeh et al 2018 lopes et al 2020 mużyło et al 2012 and thinning induced sparse forests limousin et al 2008 ma et al 2020 shinohara et al 2015 sun et al 2015 however the revised gash model has not been applied to sparse forests caused by burning we conducted a field experiment in a coniferous and broadleaved mixed forest to examine the responses of forest hydrological processes to fire disturbance the site is located in the transitional climatic zone between subtropical and warm temperate where forest ecosystems are vulnerable to climate change and increasing fire hu et al 2020 our goal was to answer the following questions 1 how does rainfall partitioning of coniferous and broadleaved mixed forest change after fire 2 how does the fire affect the canopy and meteorological parameters of the revised gash model 3 to what extent is the revised gash model appropriate for the estimation of interception loss in burned forests 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site this study took place in mount zhenlei which is located in the southeast suburb of xinyang in henan province at 32 4 n 114 9 e and an elevation of 220 m above sea level the region has a subtropical monsoon climate with a mean precipitation of 1065 mm concentrated in the growing season may to october 78 of annual total mean annual temperature is 15 2 c and ranges from 1 9 in january to 33 6 in july overstory vegetation is coniferous and broadleaved mixed fores dominated by german oak quercus acutissima and masson pine pinus massoniana trees the understory is dominated by shrubs including vitex negundo symplocos chinensis lindera glauca and rubus corchorifolius but with a few annual herbaceous species carex rigescens and lygodium japonicas the soil is categorized as haplic luvisols according to fao classification with a ph of 4 7 2 2 measurement of rainfall components a man made accidental fire occurred on 10th march 2018 on a south facing hillslope a preexisting footpath confined the fire in the west side of the study area while the east side was not disturbed by the fire the study site had not burned for more than 30 years and the overall vegetation composition was nearly homogenous before the fire therefore this fire provided an ideal opportunity for studying the impacts of fire on forest hydrology the fire reduced the proportion of canopy cover from 0 83 to 0 70 and reduced tree density from 1957 stem ha 1 to 1285 stem ha 1 according to the criteria proposed by fornwalt et al 2010 the fire was considered to be low severity overstory mortality 50 after the fire we chose one unburned and one burned plot for measurement of rainfall components the size of the plots was 50 m 50 m projected length measurement of gross rainfall and its fractions was conducted during the growing season may to october of 2019 an individual rain event was defined as a rainfall period separated from other rainfall periods by more than 8 hr given that 8 hr rain free period ensures complete canopy drying gross rainfall was measured with 3 rain gauges which were set in a clearing outside the forest the opening size was 1 m 0 2 m throughfall was monitored with 25 rain gauges that were evenly distributed throughout each 2500 m2 plot and kept stationary during the growing season the hole at the bottom of each rain gauge funneled rainwater into a plastic tank under the gauge throughfall depth was calculated using eq 1 1 tf n 1 n v a ni where tf is throughfall depth mm a is the opening area of throughfall collector m2 v is the rainfall collected by each throughfall collector l and ni is throughfall collector amount tonello et al 2021 stemflow was collected from 6 oak and 6 pine trees in each of the two plots sampled trees were representative of each plots based on several characteristics described in table 1 a plastic tube inner diameter 25 mm was cut and wrapped around each trunk we next fastened the tube with tails and filled the cracks with silicon sealant to prevent leakage of stemflow the uncut bottom of the tube was then inserted into a tank near the trunk for rain events that ceased during daylight hours rainfall components were measured within 2 h after the rain was over for rain events that extended into nighttime the rainfall fractions were measured the next morning the amount of stand scale stemflow depth was determined with eq 2 2 s f sf l mean n fa where sf is the stand scale stemflow depth mm for a given forest area fa m2 with n trees sf l mean is the mean stemflow volume of the sampled trees l zhang et al 2006 because interception loss cannot be measured directly it was indirectly determined by subtracting throughfall and stemflow from gross rainfall per eq 3 3 i gr tf sf where i tf and gr are depth of interception loss throughfall and gross precipitation respectively rodrigues et al 2021 2 3 revised gash model the revised gash model simulates interception loss on a rain event basis with the assumption of complete canopy drying after each rain event canopy sparseness is represented by scaling the mean evaporation rate during rainfall and other model parameters are reformulated based on the proportion of canopy cover the revised gash model also assumes that rainwater would not contribute to trunk storage before the canopy is saturated fathizadeh et al 2018 in the revised gash model each rain event can be divided into three periods 1 the wetting period during which the canopy does not reach saturation state 2 the saturation period during which the canopy is and remains in saturation state the mean evaporation rate of the saturated canopy is less than the mean rainfall intensity during rainfall and 3 the drying period during which the rain stops and the intercepted rainwater evaporates from the canopy into the atmosphere gash et al 1995 interception loss is a function of canopy cover proportion determining canopy parameters and meteorological variables is essential for the simulation of the revised gash model the required canopy parameters include canopy s and trunk st storage capacity free throughfall coefficient p derived from canopy cover c the sum of p and c is 1 as well as the proportion of rainfall diverted to stemflow pt the required meteorological variables consist of the total rain amount of each rain event mean rain intensity r mm h 1 and mean evaporation rate during rainfall e mm h 1 the rain amount needed to saturate the canopy grc was estimated using eq 4 4 g r c r e c s c ln 1 e c r where r is the mean rain intensity and is derived from the automatic weather station sc is the canopy storage capacity per unit cover area sc is calculated as s c canopy storage capacity s is the negative intercept of the linear equation of gross rainfall versus net rainfall the sum of throughfall and stemflow e c is the mean evaporation rate per unit cover area during rainfall and e c is calculated as e c su et al 2016 the mean evaporation rate from saturated canopy is calculated using eq 5 5 e a r where a is the slope of the linear regression between saturated canopy interception loss and gross rainfall návar 2013 sadeghi et al 2017 the rain amount needed to saturate the trunks grt was calculated using eq 6 6 gr t s c p t where pt and st are respectively the slope and negative intercept of the linear regression of stemflow versus gross rainfall the revised gash model divides the simulated interception loss into five separate fractions the formulas for which are presented in table 2 stemflow and throughfall can also be estimated from the revised gash model the estimating equations for these two hydrological fluxes are as follows eqs 7 8 7 j 1 q s f j c p tc j 1 q 1 e c j r j g r j g r c j q c s tc 8 j 1 n m tf j j 1 n m gr j j 1 n m i j j 1 q sf j where stc is the trunk storage capacity per unit cover area stc is the ratio of st to c and ptc is the proportion of rain diverted into stemflow per unit cover area and ptc is the ratio of pt to c gash et al 1995 sadeghi et al 2017 3 results 3 1 gross rainfall and rainfall partitioning over the study period we measured 30 discrete rain events producing 870 0 mm of gross rainfall incident rain events varied from 0 3 mm to 85 5 mm with an average of 29 0 mm of the 30 rain events 6 events were too small to generate measurable throughfall and 7 events were insufficient to produce stemflow cumulative throughfall for the 24 rain events for the unburned and burned plots was 619 05 mm and 677 79 mm respectively accounting for 71 1 and 77 9 of gross rainfall the linear equation between throughfall and gross rainfall for the unburned plot was th unburned 0 770gr 2 149 r2 0 99 whereas the linear equation for the burned plot was th burned 0 833gr 1 977 r2 0 99 throughfall rate increased with gross rainfall as a power function for both plots figs 1 a b and 2 total stemflow of the 23 rain events for the unburned and burned plots was 57 2 mm and 19 9 mm respectively representing 6 6 and 2 3 of gross rainfall stemflow increased linearly with increasing gross rainfall the linear equation for the unburned plot was sf unburned 0 087gr 0 772 r2 0 96 whereas the linear equation for burned plot was sf burned 0 032gr 0 306 r2 0 82 stemflow rate increased logarithmically with gross rainfall for both plots figs 1c d and 2 accumulated interception loss was 193 7 mm 22 3 of gross rainfall for the unburned plot and 172 3 mm 19 8 of gross rainfall for the burned plot the linear relationships between interception loss and gross rainfall was represented by these equations i unburned 0 145gr 2 847 r2 0 76 unburned plot and i burned 0 136gr 2 253 r2 0 82 burned plot interception loss rate decreased with increasing gross rainfall by logarithmical function for the two plots and interception loss rate was relatively large for small events because a considerable proportion of rainwater was stored by the canopy figs 1e f and 2 3 2 canopy properties and meteorological parameters burning resulted in a decrease in proportion of canopy cover c from 0 83 to 0 70 and an increase in free throughfall coefficient p from 0 17 to 0 30 after burning the canopy sc and trunk storage capacities st decreased from 2 76 mm and 0 80 mm to 1 83 mm and 0 31 mm respectively the percentage of rainfall diverted to stemflow pt was 7 8 in unburned plot and 3 2 in the burned plot the mean evaporation rate e during rainfall was slightly greater in unburned plot 0 243 mm h 1 than in the burned plot 0 229 mm h 1 the rainfall amounts required to saturate the canopy grc and trunk grt were 3 66 mm and 8 95 mm for unburned plot while corresponding values were 2 90 mm and 9 67 mm for burned plot the ratio of e c to r increased from 0 174 in the unburned plot to 0 195 in the burned plot the slopes of the linear regression interception loss versus gross rainfall a were 0 145 and 0 136 for the unburned and burned plots respectively table 3 3 3 changes in interception loss caused by fire total simulated interception loss derived from the revised gash model for the unburned plot was 205 7 mm overestimating the observed value by 6 2 12 0 mm the model underestimated observed throughfall and stemflow by 1 1 7 0 mm and 8 8 5 0 mm respectively for the burned plot the simulated interception loss throughfall and stemflow were 166 5 mm 683 1 mm and 20 4 mm respectively these simulated values underestimated observed interception loss by 3 36 5 8 mm and overestimated throughfall and stemflow by 0 8 5 3 mm and 2 3 0 5 mm respectively table 4 according to the simulation results of the revised gash model burning decreased total interception loss from 205 7 mm to 166 5 mm in the unburned plot the rate of is was the largest component of interception loss followed by ia after burning is and ia still accounted for overwhelming percentage of interception loss but the percentage of the former increased from 54 8 to 65 4 and the latter decreased from 30 9 to 25 3 it rate ranked the third in contributions to interception loss in the burned plot but its contribution to interception loss 4 2 was less than half compared to that of the unburned plot 9 0 ic and iw were the smallest components in both of these two plots and their contributions to interception loss were almost unchanged following fire disturbance figs 3 the simulated and observed interception loss values for incident rain events were compared in fig 4 as a whole the revised gash model successfully predicted interception loss for the coniferous and broadleaved mixed forest regardless of fire disturbance for most small rain events however the model slightly overestimated interception loss whereas for some large events simulated values tended to differ greatly from observed values these results indicate that total rainfall amount during rain events influences prediction accuracy of interception loss in forest ecosystems 3 4 model sensitivity we tested the sensitivities of canopy and meteorological parameters in predicting interception loss to determine to what extent fire induced changes in individual parameters can lead to changes in simulated interception loss there were clear linear positive correlations between three parameters c e and s and simulated interception loss whereas there was a nonlinear negative correlation between r and simulated interception loss in both unburned and burned plots in the unburned plot 20 decreases of c e and s suppressed interception loss by 18 2 11 0 and 5 6 respectively twenty percent decrease of r resulted in a 13 7 increase in interception loss in the burned plot deceasing twenty percent of c e and s respectively caused 19 2 13 1 and 4 5 declines in interception loss whereas a decrease of 20 in r enhanced interception loss by 16 4 in contrast 20 changes in trunk parameters st and pt only led to less than 1 changes in interception loss in both plots therefore it can be concluded that the fire did not significantly alter the sensitivity of interception loss to parameters in the revised gash model the simulated interception loss was most sensitive to changes in c and r followed by e s was the fourth most influential variable and the impacts of st and pt on interception loss can be largely neglected fig 5 4 discussions 4 1 fire effects on rainfall partitioning burning changed the water balance of the canopy resulting in an increase in throughfall and decreases in interception loss and stemflow all canopy water fluxes increased linearly with gross rainfall in the burning induced sparse forest the rates of canopy water fractions changed dramatically and stabilized gradually until gross rainfall reached a certain level figs 1 and 2 these trends are similar with thinning induced sparse forests ma et al 2020 nanko et al 2016 sun et al 2015 which suggests that fire played a similar role compared to thinning in distributing rainwater the burned forest intercepted less rainwater resulting in greater understory rainfall and water reaching the forest floor previous research has showed that consumption of understory vegetation and litter by fire reduces understory rainfall and soil infiltration resulting in increased streamflow and runoff in the short term stoof et al 2012 significant variability in canopy structure and microclimate due to fire altered the canopy hydrological parameters controlling rainfall partitioning the distribution of rainwater is strongly linked to stand structure beidokhti and moore 2021 gómez et al 2001 kaushal et al 2017 burning resulted in 34 mortality of trees in our study site and leaf area and canopy cover likely experienced corresponding decreases substantial increases incanopy openness and loss of woody biomass likely resulted in greater proportions of rain falling as direct throughfall furthermore past studies have shown that sparser canopies and reduced foliage reduce the canopy storage capacity more easily saturating the canopy and increasing release throughfall relative tointerception loss nanko et al 2016 sun et al 2018 burning not only transformed many living trees into dead trees but also knocked down some pre existing dead trees the stemflow yield of standing dead trees is very small compared to living trees and therefore can be neglected in estimating stand scale stemflow frost and levia 2014 jeong and otsuki 2021 in addition trees that survived the fire was burned to rougher bark compared to unburned trees as greater bark thickness and surface area were not conductive to the generation of stemflow these reasons together explain the lower stemflow yield in the burned forest 4 2 fire effects on interception processes forest fire which altered canopy and trunk parameters can immediately regulate rainfall redistribution patterns in forest ecosystems after burning canopy and trunk parameters changed substantially the related canopy hydrological parameters such as s sc pt and st which were favorable for intercepting and storing rainwater all decreased considerably table 3 taken together these findings indicate that post fire structural changes in forests have important implications for hydrologic cycling in forest ecosystems according to the simulation results although fire reduced the magnitude of interception loss and changed its components evaporation from the saturated canopy during and after rainfall accounted for the vast majority of interception loss for both unburned 85 7 and burned forest 90 7 these findings align with results from past studies in other forest ecosystems carlyle moses and price 1999 fathizadeh et al 2018 su et al 2016 sun et al 2022 zhang et al 2018 although c was suppressed by fire the magnitude of evaporation from the saturated canopy was almost unchanged and its contribution to total interception loss increased from 54 8 to 65 4 this increase could be attributed to the changes in evaporation rate and canopy aerodynamic conductance which increases with the decreasing tree density teklehaimanot et al 1991 consequently evaporation rate would rise accordingly and cause intercepted rainwater to evaporate faster during rainfall greater e c in the burned plot 0 327 mm h 1 relative to the unburned plot 0 293 mm h 1 supports this notion however less rainwater was retained by the sparse canopy due to burning and caused loss in evaporation from saturated canopy after the cessation of rainfall the proportion of evaporation from trunks which represents rainwater captured by the canopy that then flows down and gets absorbed by trunks decreased by half after burning which could be attributed to the decline in c this phenomenon is consistent with expectations following reduced canopy cover caused by burning 4 3 fire effects on the application of the revised gash model the predicted interception loss for the burned plot underestimated the observed value by 3 36 and the relative error was less compared to the unburned plot in which the model overestimated the observed value by 6 19 based on the predictive error muzylo et al 2009 divided the performance of interception loss into five classes extremely good error 1 very good 1 error 5 good 5 error 10 fair 10 error 30 and bad error greater than 30 the performance of the revised gash model was very good in the burned forest and good in the unburned forest moreover the simulated throughfall and stemflow were close to the observed values with 0 78 and 2 29 overestimation respectively therefore our results indicate that the performance of revised gash model could be considered sufficient for predicting interception loss and other canopy water fluxes in low severity burned forests given that the revised gash model was reformulated for application in forests with sparse canopies it is unsurprising that the revised model performed better in the burned forest where the fire killed some trees and reduced canopy cover the predictive error for interception loss mainly occurred during heavy storms and showed slight overestimation for small storms which is consistent with the results of sun et al 2014 and su et al 2016 although the model assumed that s e and r remained constant during the study period the rain intensity and evaporation rate of small storms usually cannot reach average values whereas the corresponding values for heavy storms varied dramatically therefore the modeled interception loss for most small storms tended to be larger than the observed value in contrast modeled interception loss for many large storm events can often represent over or underestimates deviated from the 1 1 line fan et al 2014 sadeghi et al 2015 sun et al 2015 in our study canopy cover c was the most important variable for predicting interception loss independent of whether or not the forest was burned which was in consistent with su et al 2016 and zhang et al 2018 many parameters eg sc e c and pt are linearly related with c limousin et al 2008 decreasing c indicates declines in the area capturing rainwater and therefore more rainwater falling as throughfall rather than getting captured as interception loss from a modeling perspective because part of the canopy was destroyed by burning model parameters that represent storage and interception of rainwater would therefore be reflected as lower values with smaller estimated corresponding fluxes r and e were also highly influential parameters in the model as presented in fig 3 evaporation from saturated canopies during storms accounted for more than half of simulated interception loss and the predictive accuracy was greatly controlled by e and r fig 5 an increase in e or a decline in r would be expected to overestimate wet canopy evaporation thereby introducing error in predicting interception loss pypker et al 2005 although canopy storage capacity s decreased from 2 76 mm to 1 83 mm due to burning these values were similar to those recorded in other forest ecosystems at similar latitudes deguchi et al 2006 gómez et al 2001 su et al 2016 in addition to being influenced by fire s was codetermined by canopy structure and meteorological variables dunkerley 2000 as tree density decreased following burning less rainwater could be absorbed by the canopy this is consistent with our observed finding of the primary importance of c in predicting interception loss in both unburned and burned forests the simulated interception loss was insensitive to trunk parameters st and pt no matter the forest was burned or not which was consistent with the findings of mużyło et al 2012 and su et al 2016 evaporation from trunks accounted for 9 0 in the unburned plot and 4 2 in the burned plot but these fractions are were too small to significantly influence the accuracy of predicted interception loss although accounting for the sensitivity of simulated interception loss to trunk parameters makes sense from a conceptual ecohydrological standpoint our results suggest that these parameters are relatively unimportant in predicting interception loss compared to other variables such as c and those directly related to c 5 conclusions we quantified changes in rainfall partitioning caused by fire in a coniferous and broadleaved mixed forest observed throughfall stemflow and interception loss derived from a water balance approach in the unburned forest were 71 1 6 6 and 22 3 of gross rainfall respectively corresponding values for the burned forest were 77 9 2 3 and 19 8 the increase in throughfall and decreases in interception loss and stemflow can be attributed to changes in canopy structure induced by burning the fire overall reduced canopy cover and foliage creating conditions unfavorable for intercepting rainwater but conducive to funneling throughfall beneath the canopy moreover the fewer remaining living trees and rough bark created conditions likely to reduce the generation of stemflow the revised gash model produced a fairly reasonable level of agreement between simulated and observed interception loss for the burned forest predictive error was 3 4 although the model slightly overestimated throughfall and stemflow by 0 8 and 2 3 respectively the predictive errors for the burned forest were lower than those of the unburned forest suggesting that the model can be considered robust and reliable in simulating rainfall fractions in burned forests although the fire changed the magnitude and components of interception loss and its sensitivity to required parameters evaporation from the saturated canopy during and after storms still dominated interception loss in addition the simulated result was most sensitive to changes in canopy cover followed by rain intensity evaporation rate and canopy storage capacity trunk parameters had only small effects on the prediction accuracy of interception loss and therefore may not need to be prioritized in similar future studies in summary our results provide empirical evidence that the revised gash model can accurately estimate key ecohydrological fluxes in disturbed forest ecosystems which has major implications for predicting and

2963,interception loss is a crucial part of the hydrological cycle and can influence the water and energy balance between the soil surface and atmosphere fire alters forest structure and then can immediately modify hydrological factors that influence interception loss we monitored and simulated canopy rainfall partitioning responses to fire were monitored in a coniferous and broadleaved mixed forest the results showed that fire had significant impacts on the process of gross rainfall partitioning fire enhanced throughfall rate from 71 1 to 77 9 but reduced interception loss rate from 22 3 to 19 8 and reduced stemflow rate from 6 6 to 2 3 our analysis showed that the revised gash model can accurately predict interception loss and other rainfall fractions in the burned forest the fire altered the proportions of interception loss components and their sensitivity to model parameters however the dominant components of interception loss were still attributed to evaporation from the water saturated canopy during and after storms moreover the predicted interception loss was still highly sensitive to changes in canopy cover rain intensity and evaporation rate these findings provide useful information for evaluating post fire changes in forest canopy water budgets and for predicting rainfall partitioning in response to climate change keywords forest hydrology forest fire interception loss rainfall partitioning revised gash model data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction when rain falls on forest canopies a fairly large proportion is intercepted and subsequently evaporates i e interception loss and thus does not fall to the forest floor soto schönherr and iroumé 2016 interception loss is a major component of water and energy balance in forest ecosystems the remaining rainwater that reaches to the forest floor represents understory or net rainfall including throughfall and stemflow throughfall the main component of understory rainfall is the sum of free throughfall rainfall dropping through canopy gaps without touching canopy surfaces and release throughfall rainfall splashing or dripping from branches and leaves fathizadeh et al 2021 levia et al 2019 by contrast stemflow is temporarily intercepted by the canopy and subsequently flows along stems or trunks towards the ground stemflow represents a comparatively small proportion of gross rainfall compared to throughfall generally accounting for less than 10 of gross rainfall fathizadeh et al 2021 su et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 forest canopies affect water balance in forest ecosystems by intercepting storing and transferring rainwater between the forest canopy and soil fathizadeh et al 2020 and therefore forest canopies can regulate local precipitation patterns and regional climate system soto schönherr and iroumé 2016 the varied mechanisms of interception loss however are quite complex forest canopy properties including tree density livesley et al 2014 species composition pérez suárez et al 2014 zhang et al 2022 leaf area index sun et al 2022 and percent canopy cover staelens et al 2006 are all expected to control interception ability and water redistribution patterns in forest ecosystems accounting for these processes is necessary for understanding and predicting water balance in forest ecosystems considering the intensification of global warming and increasing prevalence of extreme drought the frequency intensity and size of wildfires have dramatically increased in recent decades with direct consequences for forest ecosystems feurdean et al 2017 onodera and van stan 2011 moreover prescribed fire is a widely used forest management and restoration strategy that is increasingly attracting public attention harper et al 2018 fire is a potentially transformative disturbance in forest ecosystems capable of producing drastic changes in forest canopy structure by altering canopy openness foliage volume boundary layer conductance bark absorbency and canopy water storage cansler et al 2022 onodera and van stan 2011 ueyama et al 2020 these structural changes subsequently influence the transfer storage and interception of rainwater quantifying variation in interception loss and its response to fire disturbance would enhance our understanding of canopy mediated hydrologic dynamics in the context of increasing disturbance under ongoing global change interception loss is a highly variable ecohydrological flux in forest ecosystems and is the most difficult time consuming and expensive flux to evaluate and quantify in the field muzylo et al 2009 návar 2020 soto schönherr and iroumé 2016 therefore interception loss is usually derived from other rainfall fractions and small uncertainties in any of them may produce relatively large errors in estimated interception loss dunkerley 2000 su et al 2016 scholars have proposed some models to predict interception loss and these models have been refined over time to reduce input data requirements and increase model flexibility eliades et al 2022 muzylo et al 2009 the rutter model is an accepted tool for predicting interception loss but its strict data requirements greatly limit its widespread application gash 1979 provided an analytical and rain event scale alternative simplified version of the rutter model that model not only preserves the fundamental physical processes of the rutter model but also simplifies its rigorous data requirements and complex programming processes gash 1979 gash et al 1995 and valente et al 1997 reformulated the original gash model by introducing canopy cover fraction to improve its applicability in forests with sparse canopies the revised gash model has been confirmed robust and accurate in naturally sparse forests fathizadeh et al 2018 lopes et al 2020 mużyło et al 2012 and thinning induced sparse forests limousin et al 2008 ma et al 2020 shinohara et al 2015 sun et al 2015 however the revised gash model has not been applied to sparse forests caused by burning we conducted a field experiment in a coniferous and broadleaved mixed forest to examine the responses of forest hydrological processes to fire disturbance the site is located in the transitional climatic zone between subtropical and warm temperate where forest ecosystems are vulnerable to climate change and increasing fire hu et al 2020 our goal was to answer the following questions 1 how does rainfall partitioning of coniferous and broadleaved mixed forest change after fire 2 how does the fire affect the canopy and meteorological parameters of the revised gash model 3 to what extent is the revised gash model appropriate for the estimation of interception loss in burned forests 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site this study took place in mount zhenlei which is located in the southeast suburb of xinyang in henan province at 32 4 n 114 9 e and an elevation of 220 m above sea level the region has a subtropical monsoon climate with a mean precipitation of 1065 mm concentrated in the growing season may to october 78 of annual total mean annual temperature is 15 2 c and ranges from 1 9 in january to 33 6 in july overstory vegetation is coniferous and broadleaved mixed fores dominated by german oak quercus acutissima and masson pine pinus massoniana trees the understory is dominated by shrubs including vitex negundo symplocos chinensis lindera glauca and rubus corchorifolius but with a few annual herbaceous species carex rigescens and lygodium japonicas the soil is categorized as haplic luvisols according to fao classification with a ph of 4 7 2 2 measurement of rainfall components a man made accidental fire occurred on 10th march 2018 on a south facing hillslope a preexisting footpath confined the fire in the west side of the study area while the east side was not disturbed by the fire the study site had not burned for more than 30 years and the overall vegetation composition was nearly homogenous before the fire therefore this fire provided an ideal opportunity for studying the impacts of fire on forest hydrology the fire reduced the proportion of canopy cover from 0 83 to 0 70 and reduced tree density from 1957 stem ha 1 to 1285 stem ha 1 according to the criteria proposed by fornwalt et al 2010 the fire was considered to be low severity overstory mortality 50 after the fire we chose one unburned and one burned plot for measurement of rainfall components the size of the plots was 50 m 50 m projected length measurement of gross rainfall and its fractions was conducted during the growing season may to october of 2019 an individual rain event was defined as a rainfall period separated from other rainfall periods by more than 8 hr given that 8 hr rain free period ensures complete canopy drying gross rainfall was measured with 3 rain gauges which were set in a clearing outside the forest the opening size was 1 m 0 2 m throughfall was monitored with 25 rain gauges that were evenly distributed throughout each 2500 m2 plot and kept stationary during the growing season the hole at the bottom of each rain gauge funneled rainwater into a plastic tank under the gauge throughfall depth was calculated using eq 1 1 tf n 1 n v a ni where tf is throughfall depth mm a is the opening area of throughfall collector m2 v is the rainfall collected by each throughfall collector l and ni is throughfall collector amount tonello et al 2021 stemflow was collected from 6 oak and 6 pine trees in each of the two plots sampled trees were representative of each plots based on several characteristics described in table 1 a plastic tube inner diameter 25 mm was cut and wrapped around each trunk we next fastened the tube with tails and filled the cracks with silicon sealant to prevent leakage of stemflow the uncut bottom of the tube was then inserted into a tank near the trunk for rain events that ceased during daylight hours rainfall components were measured within 2 h after the rain was over for rain events that extended into nighttime the rainfall fractions were measured the next morning the amount of stand scale stemflow depth was determined with eq 2 2 s f sf l mean n fa where sf is the stand scale stemflow depth mm for a given forest area fa m2 with n trees sf l mean is the mean stemflow volume of the sampled trees l zhang et al 2006 because interception loss cannot be measured directly it was indirectly determined by subtracting throughfall and stemflow from gross rainfall per eq 3 3 i gr tf sf where i tf and gr are depth of interception loss throughfall and gross precipitation respectively rodrigues et al 2021 2 3 revised gash model the revised gash model simulates interception loss on a rain event basis with the assumption of complete canopy drying after each rain event canopy sparseness is represented by scaling the mean evaporation rate during rainfall and other model parameters are reformulated based on the proportion of canopy cover the revised gash model also assumes that rainwater would not contribute to trunk storage before the canopy is saturated fathizadeh et al 2018 in the revised gash model each rain event can be divided into three periods 1 the wetting period during which the canopy does not reach saturation state 2 the saturation period during which the canopy is and remains in saturation state the mean evaporation rate of the saturated canopy is less than the mean rainfall intensity during rainfall and 3 the drying period during which the rain stops and the intercepted rainwater evaporates from the canopy into the atmosphere gash et al 1995 interception loss is a function of canopy cover proportion determining canopy parameters and meteorological variables is essential for the simulation of the revised gash model the required canopy parameters include canopy s and trunk st storage capacity free throughfall coefficient p derived from canopy cover c the sum of p and c is 1 as well as the proportion of rainfall diverted to stemflow pt the required meteorological variables consist of the total rain amount of each rain event mean rain intensity r mm h 1 and mean evaporation rate during rainfall e mm h 1 the rain amount needed to saturate the canopy grc was estimated using eq 4 4 g r c r e c s c ln 1 e c r where r is the mean rain intensity and is derived from the automatic weather station sc is the canopy storage capacity per unit cover area sc is calculated as s c canopy storage capacity s is the negative intercept of the linear equation of gross rainfall versus net rainfall the sum of throughfall and stemflow e c is the mean evaporation rate per unit cover area during rainfall and e c is calculated as e c su et al 2016 the mean evaporation rate from saturated canopy is calculated using eq 5 5 e a r where a is the slope of the linear regression between saturated canopy interception loss and gross rainfall návar 2013 sadeghi et al 2017 the rain amount needed to saturate the trunks grt was calculated using eq 6 6 gr t s c p t where pt and st are respectively the slope and negative intercept of the linear regression of stemflow versus gross rainfall the revised gash model divides the simulated interception loss into five separate fractions the formulas for which are presented in table 2 stemflow and throughfall can also be estimated from the revised gash model the estimating equations for these two hydrological fluxes are as follows eqs 7 8 7 j 1 q s f j c p tc j 1 q 1 e c j r j g r j g r c j q c s tc 8 j 1 n m tf j j 1 n m gr j j 1 n m i j j 1 q sf j where stc is the trunk storage capacity per unit cover area stc is the ratio of st to c and ptc is the proportion of rain diverted into stemflow per unit cover area and ptc is the ratio of pt to c gash et al 1995 sadeghi et al 2017 3 results 3 1 gross rainfall and rainfall partitioning over the study period we measured 30 discrete rain events producing 870 0 mm of gross rainfall incident rain events varied from 0 3 mm to 85 5 mm with an average of 29 0 mm of the 30 rain events 6 events were too small to generate measurable throughfall and 7 events were insufficient to produce stemflow cumulative throughfall for the 24 rain events for the unburned and burned plots was 619 05 mm and 677 79 mm respectively accounting for 71 1 and 77 9 of gross rainfall the linear equation between throughfall and gross rainfall for the unburned plot was th unburned 0 770gr 2 149 r2 0 99 whereas the linear equation for the burned plot was th burned 0 833gr 1 977 r2 0 99 throughfall rate increased with gross rainfall as a power function for both plots figs 1 a b and 2 total stemflow of the 23 rain events for the unburned and burned plots was 57 2 mm and 19 9 mm respectively representing 6 6 and 2 3 of gross rainfall stemflow increased linearly with increasing gross rainfall the linear equation for the unburned plot was sf unburned 0 087gr 0 772 r2 0 96 whereas the linear equation for burned plot was sf burned 0 032gr 0 306 r2 0 82 stemflow rate increased logarithmically with gross rainfall for both plots figs 1c d and 2 accumulated interception loss was 193 7 mm 22 3 of gross rainfall for the unburned plot and 172 3 mm 19 8 of gross rainfall for the burned plot the linear relationships between interception loss and gross rainfall was represented by these equations i unburned 0 145gr 2 847 r2 0 76 unburned plot and i burned 0 136gr 2 253 r2 0 82 burned plot interception loss rate decreased with increasing gross rainfall by logarithmical function for the two plots and interception loss rate was relatively large for small events because a considerable proportion of rainwater was stored by the canopy figs 1e f and 2 3 2 canopy properties and meteorological parameters burning resulted in a decrease in proportion of canopy cover c from 0 83 to 0 70 and an increase in free throughfall coefficient p from 0 17 to 0 30 after burning the canopy sc and trunk storage capacities st decreased from 2 76 mm and 0 80 mm to 1 83 mm and 0 31 mm respectively the percentage of rainfall diverted to stemflow pt was 7 8 in unburned plot and 3 2 in the burned plot the mean evaporation rate e during rainfall was slightly greater in unburned plot 0 243 mm h 1 than in the burned plot 0 229 mm h 1 the rainfall amounts required to saturate the canopy grc and trunk grt were 3 66 mm and 8 95 mm for unburned plot while corresponding values were 2 90 mm and 9 67 mm for burned plot the ratio of e c to r increased from 0 174 in the unburned plot to 0 195 in the burned plot the slopes of the linear regression interception loss versus gross rainfall a were 0 145 and 0 136 for the unburned and burned plots respectively table 3 3 3 changes in interception loss caused by fire total simulated interception loss derived from the revised gash model for the unburned plot was 205 7 mm overestimating the observed value by 6 2 12 0 mm the model underestimated observed throughfall and stemflow by 1 1 7 0 mm and 8 8 5 0 mm respectively for the burned plot the simulated interception loss throughfall and stemflow were 166 5 mm 683 1 mm and 20 4 mm respectively these simulated values underestimated observed interception loss by 3 36 5 8 mm and overestimated throughfall and stemflow by 0 8 5 3 mm and 2 3 0 5 mm respectively table 4 according to the simulation results of the revised gash model burning decreased total interception loss from 205 7 mm to 166 5 mm in the unburned plot the rate of is was the largest component of interception loss followed by ia after burning is and ia still accounted for overwhelming percentage of interception loss but the percentage of the former increased from 54 8 to 65 4 and the latter decreased from 30 9 to 25 3 it rate ranked the third in contributions to interception loss in the burned plot but its contribution to interception loss 4 2 was less than half compared to that of the unburned plot 9 0 ic and iw were the smallest components in both of these two plots and their contributions to interception loss were almost unchanged following fire disturbance figs 3 the simulated and observed interception loss values for incident rain events were compared in fig 4 as a whole the revised gash model successfully predicted interception loss for the coniferous and broadleaved mixed forest regardless of fire disturbance for most small rain events however the model slightly overestimated interception loss whereas for some large events simulated values tended to differ greatly from observed values these results indicate that total rainfall amount during rain events influences prediction accuracy of interception loss in forest ecosystems 3 4 model sensitivity we tested the sensitivities of canopy and meteorological parameters in predicting interception loss to determine to what extent fire induced changes in individual parameters can lead to changes in simulated interception loss there were clear linear positive correlations between three parameters c e and s and simulated interception loss whereas there was a nonlinear negative correlation between r and simulated interception loss in both unburned and burned plots in the unburned plot 20 decreases of c e and s suppressed interception loss by 18 2 11 0 and 5 6 respectively twenty percent decrease of r resulted in a 13 7 increase in interception loss in the burned plot deceasing twenty percent of c e and s respectively caused 19 2 13 1 and 4 5 declines in interception loss whereas a decrease of 20 in r enhanced interception loss by 16 4 in contrast 20 changes in trunk parameters st and pt only led to less than 1 changes in interception loss in both plots therefore it can be concluded that the fire did not significantly alter the sensitivity of interception loss to parameters in the revised gash model the simulated interception loss was most sensitive to changes in c and r followed by e s was the fourth most influential variable and the impacts of st and pt on interception loss can be largely neglected fig 5 4 discussions 4 1 fire effects on rainfall partitioning burning changed the water balance of the canopy resulting in an increase in throughfall and decreases in interception loss and stemflow all canopy water fluxes increased linearly with gross rainfall in the burning induced sparse forest the rates of canopy water fractions changed dramatically and stabilized gradually until gross rainfall reached a certain level figs 1 and 2 these trends are similar with thinning induced sparse forests ma et al 2020 nanko et al 2016 sun et al 2015 which suggests that fire played a similar role compared to thinning in distributing rainwater the burned forest intercepted less rainwater resulting in greater understory rainfall and water reaching the forest floor previous research has showed that consumption of understory vegetation and litter by fire reduces understory rainfall and soil infiltration resulting in increased streamflow and runoff in the short term stoof et al 2012 significant variability in canopy structure and microclimate due to fire altered the canopy hydrological parameters controlling rainfall partitioning the distribution of rainwater is strongly linked to stand structure beidokhti and moore 2021 gómez et al 2001 kaushal et al 2017 burning resulted in 34 mortality of trees in our study site and leaf area and canopy cover likely experienced corresponding decreases substantial increases incanopy openness and loss of woody biomass likely resulted in greater proportions of rain falling as direct throughfall furthermore past studies have shown that sparser canopies and reduced foliage reduce the canopy storage capacity more easily saturating the canopy and increasing release throughfall relative tointerception loss nanko et al 2016 sun et al 2018 burning not only transformed many living trees into dead trees but also knocked down some pre existing dead trees the stemflow yield of standing dead trees is very small compared to living trees and therefore can be neglected in estimating stand scale stemflow frost and levia 2014 jeong and otsuki 2021 in addition trees that survived the fire was burned to rougher bark compared to unburned trees as greater bark thickness and surface area were not conductive to the generation of stemflow these reasons together explain the lower stemflow yield in the burned forest 4 2 fire effects on interception processes forest fire which altered canopy and trunk parameters can immediately regulate rainfall redistribution patterns in forest ecosystems after burning canopy and trunk parameters changed substantially the related canopy hydrological parameters such as s sc pt and st which were favorable for intercepting and storing rainwater all decreased considerably table 3 taken together these findings indicate that post fire structural changes in forests have important implications for hydrologic cycling in forest ecosystems according to the simulation results although fire reduced the magnitude of interception loss and changed its components evaporation from the saturated canopy during and after rainfall accounted for the vast majority of interception loss for both unburned 85 7 and burned forest 90 7 these findings align with results from past studies in other forest ecosystems carlyle moses and price 1999 fathizadeh et al 2018 su et al 2016 sun et al 2022 zhang et al 2018 although c was suppressed by fire the magnitude of evaporation from the saturated canopy was almost unchanged and its contribution to total interception loss increased from 54 8 to 65 4 this increase could be attributed to the changes in evaporation rate and canopy aerodynamic conductance which increases with the decreasing tree density teklehaimanot et al 1991 consequently evaporation rate would rise accordingly and cause intercepted rainwater to evaporate faster during rainfall greater e c in the burned plot 0 327 mm h 1 relative to the unburned plot 0 293 mm h 1 supports this notion however less rainwater was retained by the sparse canopy due to burning and caused loss in evaporation from saturated canopy after the cessation of rainfall the proportion of evaporation from trunks which represents rainwater captured by the canopy that then flows down and gets absorbed by trunks decreased by half after burning which could be attributed to the decline in c this phenomenon is consistent with expectations following reduced canopy cover caused by burning 4 3 fire effects on the application of the revised gash model the predicted interception loss for the burned plot underestimated the observed value by 3 36 and the relative error was less compared to the unburned plot in which the model overestimated the observed value by 6 19 based on the predictive error muzylo et al 2009 divided the performance of interception loss into five classes extremely good error 1 very good 1 error 5 good 5 error 10 fair 10 error 30 and bad error greater than 30 the performance of the revised gash model was very good in the burned forest and good in the unburned forest moreover the simulated throughfall and stemflow were close to the observed values with 0 78 and 2 29 overestimation respectively therefore our results indicate that the performance of revised gash model could be considered sufficient for predicting interception loss and other canopy water fluxes in low severity burned forests given that the revised gash model was reformulated for application in forests with sparse canopies it is unsurprising that the revised model performed better in the burned forest where the fire killed some trees and reduced canopy cover the predictive error for interception loss mainly occurred during heavy storms and showed slight overestimation for small storms which is consistent with the results of sun et al 2014 and su et al 2016 although the model assumed that s e and r remained constant during the study period the rain intensity and evaporation rate of small storms usually cannot reach average values whereas the corresponding values for heavy storms varied dramatically therefore the modeled interception loss for most small storms tended to be larger than the observed value in contrast modeled interception loss for many large storm events can often represent over or underestimates deviated from the 1 1 line fan et al 2014 sadeghi et al 2015 sun et al 2015 in our study canopy cover c was the most important variable for predicting interception loss independent of whether or not the forest was burned which was in consistent with su et al 2016 and zhang et al 2018 many parameters eg sc e c and pt are linearly related with c limousin et al 2008 decreasing c indicates declines in the area capturing rainwater and therefore more rainwater falling as throughfall rather than getting captured as interception loss from a modeling perspective because part of the canopy was destroyed by burning model parameters that represent storage and interception of rainwater would therefore be reflected as lower values with smaller estimated corresponding fluxes r and e were also highly influential parameters in the model as presented in fig 3 evaporation from saturated canopies during storms accounted for more than half of simulated interception loss and the predictive accuracy was greatly controlled by e and r fig 5 an increase in e or a decline in r would be expected to overestimate wet canopy evaporation thereby introducing error in predicting interception loss pypker et al 2005 although canopy storage capacity s decreased from 2 76 mm to 1 83 mm due to burning these values were similar to those recorded in other forest ecosystems at similar latitudes deguchi et al 2006 gómez et al 2001 su et al 2016 in addition to being influenced by fire s was codetermined by canopy structure and meteorological variables dunkerley 2000 as tree density decreased following burning less rainwater could be absorbed by the canopy this is consistent with our observed finding of the primary importance of c in predicting interception loss in both unburned and burned forests the simulated interception loss was insensitive to trunk parameters st and pt no matter the forest was burned or not which was consistent with the findings of mużyło et al 2012 and su et al 2016 evaporation from trunks accounted for 9 0 in the unburned plot and 4 2 in the burned plot but these fractions are were too small to significantly influence the accuracy of predicted interception loss although accounting for the sensitivity of simulated interception loss to trunk parameters makes sense from a conceptual ecohydrological standpoint our results suggest that these parameters are relatively unimportant in predicting interception loss compared to other variables such as c and those directly related to c 5 conclusions we quantified changes in rainfall partitioning caused by fire in a coniferous and broadleaved mixed forest observed throughfall stemflow and interception loss derived from a water balance approach in the unburned forest were 71 1 6 6 and 22 3 of gross rainfall respectively corresponding values for the burned forest were 77 9 2 3 and 19 8 the increase in throughfall and decreases in interception loss and stemflow can be attributed to changes in canopy structure induced by burning the fire overall reduced canopy cover and foliage creating conditions unfavorable for intercepting rainwater but conducive to funneling throughfall beneath the canopy moreover the fewer remaining living trees and rough bark created conditions likely to reduce the generation of stemflow the revised gash model produced a fairly reasonable level of agreement between simulated and observed interception loss for the burned forest predictive error was 3 4 although the model slightly overestimated throughfall and stemflow by 0 8 and 2 3 respectively the predictive errors for the burned forest were lower than those of the unburned forest suggesting that the model can be considered robust and reliable in simulating rainfall fractions in burned forests although the fire changed the magnitude and components of interception loss and its sensitivity to required parameters evaporation from the saturated canopy during and after storms still dominated interception loss in addition the simulated result was most sensitive to changes in canopy cover followed by rain intensity evaporation rate and canopy storage capacity trunk parameters had only small effects on the prediction accuracy of interception loss and therefore may not need to be prioritized in similar future studies in summary our results provide empirical evidence that the revised gash model can accurately estimate key ecohydrological fluxes in disturbed forest ecosystems which has major implications for predicting and

2964,prediction of river flow rates is an essential task for both flood protection and optimal water resource management the high uncertainty associated with basin characteristics hydrological processes and climatic factors affecting river flows make streamflow prediction a very challenging problem these reasons together with the increasingly wide availability of data relating to flow rates and rainfall frequently lead to a preference for data driven models over physically based or conceptual forecasting models this study shows the results of an in depth comparison between two different daily streamflow prediction models a novel simpler model based on the stacking of the random forest and multilayer perceptron algorithms using the elastic net algorithm as meta learner and a more complex model based on bi directional long short term memory lstm networks bayesian optimization was employed in selecting hyperparameters the two prediction models were compared through the analysis of four different case studies the bacchiglione river the raccoon river the wilson river and the trent river the two models showed comparable forecasting capabilities in the most favourable cases both models demonstrated very high accuracy r2 greater than 0 93 mean absolute percentage error approximately equal to 10 the stacked model outperformed the bi directional lstm network model in several cases in predicting peak flow rates but was less accurate in forecasting low flow rates in addition its computation times are significantly shorter the prediction accuracy of both models decreased as the forecast horizon increased the length of the time series plays an essential role in developing models with satisfactory forecasting capabilities in this study the effectiveness of forecasting models was not influenced by the river regime however a high variance of the input dataset and a large number of outliers in the time series can reduce the accuracy of prediction models keywords streamflow forecasting machine learning stacking bidirectional lstm data availability the data used are freely available online 1 introduction streamflow prediction with particular interest for floods and low flows is a matter of great practical interest both from a technical and socio economic point of view river flood forecasting is essential for risk management and for ensuring public safety on the other hand the prediction of low river flows is crucial to optimize water resources management and to assess the risk of drought ostad ali askari et al 2017a the effects of climate change which make both floods and low flow periods more frequent and severe increase the need for reliable forecasting models fatahi nafchi et al 2021 villarini wasko 2021 saedi et al 2022 accurate streamflow prediction is a complex task that can be addressed by physically based conceptual and data driven models the physically based models are based on several mathematical equations describing the hydrological processes representative of the basin s response to precipitation events the conceptual models are based on a simplification of the processes and on empirical equations between hydrological parameters the high uncertainty associated with catchment characteristics rainfall runoff processes flow paths precipitation and other climatic factors affecting river flows has gradually led researchers to increasingly consider data driven forecasting models instead of physically based and conceptual models in particular artificial intelligence algorithms have been extensively used in recent years in the development of forecasting models of hydrological quantities e g nourani et al 2008 adamowski chan 2011 deo et al 2017 yaseen et al 2019 adnan et al 2020 granata di nunno 2021a

boucher et al 2010 shiri kisi 2010 rasouli et al 2012 kisi et al 2012 a comprehensive review of many valuable articles on streamflow forecasting in the 2000 2015 period was carried out by yaseen et al 2015 artificial neural network ann was probably the most popular algorithm in streamflow prediction in those years ostad ali askari et al 2017b although in some cases it was not the most accurate shortridge et al 2016 in recent years referring to the daily streamflow the researchers efforts have been mainly oriented towards improving predictions through the development of ensemble models or hybrid models papacharalampous et al 2019 compared several stochastic and machine learning methods for the multi step ahead forecasting of hydrological processes by executing large scale computational experiments based on simulations under the assumptions of linearity and stationarity proving that stochastic and machine learning methods can be considered equally useful in univariate short time series forecasting at large time scales in addition the authors conducted a large scale real world experiment based on 405 mean annual river discharge time series this latter experiment did not assume linearity parisouj et al 2020 compared prediction models of daily and monthly streamflow based on support vector regression svr ann and extreme learning machine elm for 4 rivers in the united states showing that the svr model led to better results than the elm and ann saraiva et al 2021 performed a comparative analysis of ann and svr coupled with wavelet transform and data resampling with the bootstrap method in forecasting daily streamflow into sobradinho reservoir brazil the authors showed that the ann based models were more accurate than the svm based ones tyralis et al 2021 used super ensemble learning for one step ahead daily streamflow forecasting combining 10 different machine learning algorithms the super ensemble learning algorithm outperformed all base learners the best of which was the ann model the study was performed considering a large dataset comprising 10 years of daily data from 511 basins having noted the good performance provided by models based on neural networks more recently some authors have developed predictive models of the streamflow based on deep learning algorithms cheng et al 2020 conducted long lead time streamflow forecasting using both ann and lstm at daily and monthly scales they highlighted that the lstm model was superior to the ann based model in the daily streamflow forecasting for a long lead time feng et al 2020 proposed a flexible data integration to improve streamflow forecasting using lstm in 671 catchments of the united states finding that the greatest benefits of integration were obtained in regions with high autocorrelation in streamflow fu et al 2020 proposed a lstm based deep learning model to simulate streamflow in the kelantan river malaysia they found that the lstm based model showed high accuracy both in forecasting smooth streamflow in the dry season and rapidly fluctuant streamflow in the rainy season outperforming a classical neural network with back propagation ahmed et al 2021 developed an optimized deep hybrid learning random forest rf lstm to forecast streamflow water level at six river stations within murray darling basin australia based on the boruta feature selection algorithm brf their model considered antecedent climate indices precipitation and periodicity factor the model was compared to other hybrid and standalone models based on lstm gated recurrent units gru recurrent neural network rnn and svr outperforming all of them several other valuable studies based on machine learning algorithms have not been discussed in detail here just for the sake of brevity e g zhou et al 2019 kao et al 2020 tikhamarine et al 2020 yang et al 2020 apaydin et al 2021 kao et al 2021 kim et al 2021 mirzaei et al 2021 chang et al 2022 elbeltagi et al 2022 song 2022 etc an important limitation of the current literature is represented by the progressive trend towards increasingly complex models dependent on a large number of parameters and input data which often cannot be easily estimated or obtained such models can be computationally expensive furthermore the accuracy of the same can vary greatly depending on the case study it would therefore be very useful to have simple models based on few input variables and few parameters characterized by forecasting capabilities comparable to those of recently developed complex models with this in mind this research introduces a novel streamflow forecasting model developed by stacking two simple machine learning algorithms and tries to answer the following unresolved questions can this novel ensemble model provide results comparable to those of a more complex deep learning algorithm such as bidirectional lstm in daily streamflow prediction in particular are these models able to predict flood peaks and minimum flows accurately and promptly how does the performance of the models change as the forecast horizon increases stacking is an ensemble machine learning technique to combine multiple classification or regression models via a meta classifier stacking can harness the capabilities of a number of well performing models on a classification or regression task in order to outperform the individual models of the ensemble in making predictions the individual classification or regression models are developed based on the whole training dataset then a meta classifier is fitted based on the outputs meta features of the individual models in the ensemble the ensemble model was obtained by stacking the random forest rf and multilayer perceptron mlp algorithms elastic net en algorithm was used as meta learner rf is very accurate robust to outliers and has a low risk of overfitting on the other hand it is not suitable for dealing with many sparse features mlp can tackle complex nonlinear problems is fast in providing predictions after training and works well even with large input datasets however performance is greatly affected by the quality of the input dataset taken individually rf and mlp are generally not the best performing algorithms in predicting time series however the combination proposed in this study can significantly improve their forecasting capabilities to show the potential of the stacked algorithm it is compared with an algorithm recognized as one of the best performing for time series prediction problems lstm in its most advanced bidirectional variant for the sake of a greater generality of the results four different rivers were considered as case studies geographically distant and with different hydrological characteristics 2 materials and methods 2 1 stacking of random forest and multilayer perceptron as stated above random forest rf and multilayer perceptron mlp were used as the base learners while the elastic net en algorithm was chosen as the meta classifier to develop the stacked forecasting models rf breiman 2001 is an ensemble forecasting algorithm obtained by combining a set of individual regression trees in order to provide a single value of the target variable each individual regression tree breiman et al 2017 is characterized by a root node which includes the training dataset by internal nodes which specify conditions on the input variables and by leaves which represent the real values assigned to the target variables a regression tree model is developed through the recursive subdivision of the input data set into subsets a multivariable linear regression model provides predictions in each subset during the growth of the tree each branch is divided into smaller partitions evaluating all the possible subdivisions on each field and finding at each stage the split into two distinct partitions that minimizes the least squared deviation 1 r t 1 n t i t y i y m t 2 in which n t is the number of units in the node t yi is the value of the target variable in the i th unit and ym is the average value of the target variable in the node t r t gives an estimate of the impurity in each node the procedure ends when the minimum impurity is reached or if a different stopping rule occurs first a pruning process reduces the risk of overfitting each tree of the forest is developed from a different bootstrap of the training dataset furthermore in each node there is a random choice of only a part of the variables with respect to which to carry out the subdivision the number of these variables is constant throughout the development of the forest mlp is a class of feedforward artificial neural networks murtagh 1991 able to approximate any continuous function an mlp consists of three layers of nodes at least an input layer a hidden layer and an output layer the input layer includes the nodes receiving the input data each node in the hidden layer processes the values from the preceding layer using a weighted linear sum followed by a non linear activation function the last hidden layer passes the values to the output layer which transforms them into the final calculated values algorithm training is carried out using the backpropagation technique the neural networks used in this study had 1 hidden layer the sigmoid was selected as the activation function the squared error was chosen as the loss function elastic net zou hastie 2005 is a combination of the two most commonly employed regularized variants of linear regression the lasso least absolute shrinkage and selection operator and the ridge methods lasso also known as l1 regularization pursues the goal of selecting the most explanatory variables by introducing an absolute penalty to the ordinary least squares ols regression ridge regularization known as l2 regularization also introduces a penalty in the ols formulation penalizing square weights rather than absolute weights in this way large weights are penalized considerably and many small weights are distributed across the spectrum of features given a training dataset in which y y1 yn are the targets and x xij i 1 n j 1 p is the matrix of the predictors en algorithm aims to reduce the number of features but also to spread weights more robustly across the remaining features to achieve this the following problem must be solved 2 β arg min l λ 1 λ 2 β y x β λ 2 j 1 p β j 2 λ 1 j 1 p β j where βis the vector of the coefficients of the linear regression model while λ1 and λ 2 are fixed nonnegative values let α λ2 λ1 λ 2 the problem stated by equation 2 is equivalent to the following optimization problem 3 β arg min y x β 2 s u b j e c t t o 1 α j 1 p β j α j 1 p β j 2 t for some t therefore α is the fundamental parameter of the algorithm a flowchart illustrating the implementation of the model based on the stacking of rf and mlp is shown in fig 1 it can be shown that the elastic net can be reduced to a linear support vector machine zhou et al 2015 2 2 bidirectional long short term memory networks lstm networks hochreiter schmidhuber 1997 have proved to be particularly effective in solving complex problems involving time series of hydrological quantities granata di nunno 2021b an lstm layer is made up of a set of memory blocks connected in a recurring way each of them contains one or more recurrently connected memory cells and three multiplicative units the input the output and the forget gate which allow read write and reset operations for the cells the network can only interact with the cells through the gates each memory cell in the lstm network is interconnected through the hidden state h t referred to as short term memory and the cell state c t known as long term memory the representative equations of an lstm cell can be posed in the form 4 f t σ w f h t 1 w f i n p u t t b f 5 i t σ w i h t 1 w i i n p u t t b i 6 c t f t c t 1 i t tanh w c h t 1 w c i n p u t t b c 7 o t σ w o h t 1 w o i n p u t t b o 8 h t σ t tanh c t where ft represents the forget state it is the input gate state and ot is the output gate state while the weights and the biases associated to these gates are wf and bf wi and bi wo and bo respectively while wc and bc are the weight and the bias linked to the cell state through the cell state the lstm network is able to store crucial information for an extended period see fig 2 in standard lstm networks data processing is carried out in one direction forward while necessary information is stored or predicted based on previous data a bidirectional lstm graves schmidhuber 2005 has a more advanced architecture compared to standard lstm since data are processed simultaneously in both forward and reverse directions the output of the bidirectional lstm network at time step t is provided by a combination of two separate hidden levels where each hidden level represents a training sequence corresponding to the forward and reverse directions thus bidirectional lstm can learn both future and past information of the input sequence better than standard lstm obviously future information i e a later part of the time series is only available in the training stage in the prediction models developed in this study a dropout layer and a dense layer were added to the layers made up of lstm cells a dropout layer randomly sets input elements to zero with a given probability a dense layer is a layer that is deeply connected with its preceding layer and allows to change the dimensionality of the output from the preceding layer 2 3 case studies the four case studies considered fig 3 are the bacchiglione river italy the raccoon river iowa usa the wilson river oregon usa and the trent river uk the bacchiglione is a 118 km river in veneto northern italy it flows in the provinces of vicenza padua and the metropolitan city of venice it joins the brenta river in the locality of ca pasqua near chioggia in the south of the venetian lagoon then flows into the upper adriatic after 6 km mazzoleni et al 2018 bacchiglione river is fed by springs located in a transition plain between the gravelly piedmont plain and the clay silty sandy lower plain at 30 km north east of padua frequent floods of the river over the centuries have often caused serious damage to the city of vicenza submerging entire neighborhoods the average annual rainfall estimated at the vicenza rain gage is approximately equal to 1150 mm while the average annual temperature is equal to about 12 9 c daily measurements of river flow rate were collected at montegalda station where the river basin is about 2063 km2 flow rate and rainfall data were provided by the veneto regional agency for environmental prevention and protection www arpa veneto it the raccoon river is a 49 6 km tributary of the des moines river in central iowa upstream it flows from northwest to southeast as three streams north raccoon river middle raccoon river and south raccoon river if measured considering the longest of its three streams the north raccoon river its length increases to 364 km both north and middle raccoon rivers flow through a recently glaciated landform the des moines lobe with limited surface drainage and a low relief landscape prior 1991 instead the south raccoon river flows into an older pre illinoian landscape characterized by a well developed surface drainage system and higher relief jones and schilling 2011 the three streams converge in a single stream referred to as raccoon river which joins the des moines river at des moines city the average annual precipitation of the area is about 840 mm while the annual average temperature is 8 7 c daily measurements of river flow rate were collected at van meter station where the river basin is about 11976 km2 the wilson river is a 53 km long river that flows from the tillamook state forest to its mouth at the tillamook bay oregon the catchment area cover consists mainly of deciduous and evergreen forests the average annual precipitation is very high about 2250 mm at tillamook increasing dramatically in the coast range mountains to the east much higher than the average oregon and united states annual precipitation equal to about 695 mm and 765 mm respectively the wilson river flow rate changes significantly during the year with an average flow rate near tillamook that passes from about 3 m3 s in august to about 75 m3 s in december daily measurements of river flow rate were collected from a station located upstream of the city of tillamook where the river basin is about 600 km2 for both raccoon river and wilson river flow rate and rainfall data were provided by the u s geological survey https waterdata usgs gov the trent river is the third longest river in the united kingdom with a length of 298 km its headwater is in the staffordshire on the southern edge of the biddulph moor the river flows through different cities of the midlands from stoke on trent to nottingham before joining the ouse river at trent falls forming the humber estuary the latter empties into the north sea between the cities of hull yorkshire and immingham lincolnshire the river is also known for dramatic flooding which usually occurs after storms and spring snowmelt large and petts 1996 land use is predominantly rural with up to 70 of the basin given over to agriculture the average annual rainfall for the whole basin is about 720 mm lower than the average united kingdom and england annual rainfall equal to 1101 mm and 828 mm respectively the average flow rate passes from 0 6 m3 s in the upper reaches near stoke on trent to values of about 85 m3 s at colwick near nottingham due to the contribution of large tributaries including the sow and blithe near yoxall and the dove derwent and soar upstream of nottingham in addition the trent has marked variations in discharge during the year daily flow rate and rainfall data for the trent river collected at the colwick station where the river basin is about 12355 km2 were provided by the national river flow archive uk https nrfa ceh ac uk data search fig 4 and table 1 report the essential information to characterize the river regimes of the case studies see table 2 the bacchiglione river is characterized by higher flows in autumn and lower flows throughout the summer the raccoon river has its highest flow rates in early summer and its lowest during the winter months the wilson river has its maximum flows in the months of december and january while the flows become low in the summer months the trent river has the highest flows in the spring months and the lowest flows in the autumn months the bacchiglione river is characterized by the lowest interquartile range iqr 15 7 m3 s while the raccoon river has the highest iqr 86 79 m3 s the four rivers are characterized by clearly different regimes 2 4 evaluation metrics four different valuation metrics were used to estimate the accuracy of forecasting models the coefficient of determination root mean squared error mean directional accuracy and mean absolute percentage error coefficient of determination r2 is a statistical measure in a regression model that evaluates the goodness of fit of the model to the data by a number in the range 0 1 it is defined as 9 r 2 1 t f t y t 2 t y a y t 2 where ft is the foreseen value at time t yt is the observed value at time t and ya is the averaged value of the observed data root mean squared error rmse is a measure of the absolute error in which deviations are squared to prevent positive and negative values from cancelling each other out furthermore this measure amplifies the errors of greater value a characteristic that penalizes the models with the most significant errors 10 rmse t f t y t 2 n where n is the total amount of forecasting data in the time series mean directional accuracy mda compares the forecast direction upward or downward to the actual realized direction providing the probability that the forecasting model can detect the correct direction of the time series it is evaluated by the following equation 11 mda 1 n t 1 sgn y t y t 1 sgn f t y t 1 in which sgn is the sign function while 1 is the indicator function mean absolute percentage error mape is the average of the absolute percentage errors of the prediction model where the error is defined as actual value minus the predicted value percentage errors are considered without regard to sign to calculate mape 12 mape 100 n t y t f t y t 2 5 model development and optimization one of the essential problems to be faced in the development of any forecasting model concerns the optimal choice of input variables the streamflow forecast models developed in this study consider as input variables the lagged values of the flow rates and the lagged values of the rainfall measured at a rain gauge that is fairly representative of the precipitation in the basin the choice of the optimal number of lagged values of flow rate and precipitation as well as the selection of the optimal values of the hyperparameters was carried out by means of a bayesian optimization procedure a bayesian optimization method uses an objective function probability model to iteratively select sets of hyperparameters to evaluate a bayesian optimization process is characterized by five essential operations selection of the domain of the hyperparameters choice of the objective function which based on the values of the hyperparameters generates a score to be minimized choice of the surrogate model probability model of the objective function definition of a criterion called a selection function for choosing the next set of hyperparameters from the surrogate model identification of a history composed of pairs score hyperparameter used by the algorithm to update the surrogate model a more detailed description of the procedure is omitted here for the sake of brevity for further information please refer to the essential literature e g snoek et al 2012 in this study rmse was chosen as the score to be minimized tree structured parzen estimator tpe algorithm was selected as surrogate model while the expected improvement ei was adopted for selecting the next set of hyperparameters tpe is a sequential model based optimization that sequentially builds models to approximate the performance of hyperparameters based on observed data and then subsequently chooses new hyperparameters to test based on this model the ei algorithm favors the branch that leads to the largest amount of improvement upon a target here it should be pointed out that from a preliminary analysis of the 4 case studies the stacked model proved to be not very sensitive to the number of trees in the random forest and to the number of hidden nodes in the mlp algorithm therefore for simplicity the same value was chosen for the 4 different models also simplifying the optimization procedure the main hyperparameters of the forecasting models are shown in tab 2 based on the optimization process the forecast models for the four different case studies require the following values as input bacchiglione river q 8 q 7 q 1 h 5 h 4 h 1 raccoon river q 15 q 14 q 1 h 6 h 5 h 1 wilson river q 7 q 6 q 1 h 7 h 6 h 1 trent river q 12 q 11 q 1 h 5 h 4 h 1 where q p and h q are the lagged values of daily flow rate and daily precipitation respectively with lag equal to p and q the training of each model was carried out using 90 of the time series data while the test was conducted on the remaining 10 this subdivision led to the most accurate results the forecasting models were developed in python environment 3 results table 3 shows the values of the evaluation metrics for the forecast models of all the rivers considered with reference to the 1 day ahead flow rates the two forecasting algorithms are compared here with reference to each case study the study first considered time series of equal length for the four case studies the importance of the length of the training time series will be discussed below fig 5 shows the time series of the observed and predicted values of the flow rates for the bacchiglione river the stacked model of rf and mlp slightly outperformed the one based on bi lstm both in the training and testing stages tab 3 both models were able to predict the occurrence of floods in the testing phase however the stacked model predicted peak values closer to real ones moreover in the case of the stacked model in some events the forecasted peak values exceed those observed while the bi lstm model underestimated peak values in almost all cases in order to provide information on the accuracy of the two models in the different discharge ranges the histograms of fig 6 show respectively the mape evaluated in the 4 quartiles and the mape evaluated in the 1st and 10th decile of the test discharges it can be noted that the predictions made with bi lstm were characterized by a higher mape in the second third and fourth quartiles in addition the stacked model was characterized by greater accuracy in both the first and tenth decile thus proving to be more suitable for predicting both minimum and maximum flow rates fig 7 reports the time series of observed and predicted values of the flow rates in the raccoon river the stacked rf mlp model slightly outperformed the bi lstm based model in the training stage while the latter turned out to be more accurate in the testing stage tab 3 the stacked model showed a tendency to slightly overestimate the peak values which are instead accurately predicted by bi lstm the predictions of the stacked model were characterized by several sudden increases in range and in some cases even by peaks of small magnitude which were not reflected in the observed values the stacked model generated some noise in the predictions this occurrence explains the high value of the mape that characterizes the predictions of the stacked model in the testing stage the mape evaluation in the flow sub ranges fig 8 shows that the accuracies of the two models were similar with regard to the higher flow rates while the bi lstm was much more accurate in predicting the low flow rates of the raccoon river fig 9 shows the time series of observed and forecasted values of the flow rates in the wilson river also in this case both models provided very good forecasts however discordant evaluations were obtained from the metrics the stacked model was characterized by better values of r2 and rmse while bi lstm had better values of mape and mda both models showed a tendency to underestimate the maximum peak flow rates this tendency was more marked in the bi lstm model moreover fig 10 shows that the two models had practically the same accuracy in predicting the 4th quartile or 10th decile flow rates while the mape of the stacked model was considerably higher for the 1st quartile and 1st decile flow rates the time series of measured and predicted flows of the trent river in the testing phase are shown in fig 11 both models yielded very good outcomes for the trent river the values of r2 rmse and mape were fully satisfactory and in the testing stage the metrics had values similar to those of the training phase moreover both models demonstrated a remarkable ability to accurately predict both peak and minimum flow rates in addition the stacked model was characterized by lower mape values with reference to the 1st decile and 10th decile flow rates while the bi lstm model in turn led to lower mape values in the intermediate flow rates 2nd and 3rd quartile fig 12 considering the 2 days ahead forecasts the stacked rf mlp model outperformed the bi lstm model in the case of the bacchiglione river underperformed it in the case of the raccoon river while conflicting indications were obtained from the evaluation metrics regarding the wilson river and the trent river for the sake of brevity the time series diagrams in the testing stage are not shown however the following should be highlighted in the case of bacchiglione river both models were able to predict the occurrence of floods the stacked rf mlp model underestimated the peak flow rates in some cases overestimated them in other cases while the bi lstm model generally underestimated the peak flow rates as for the raccoon river the stacked model on the one hand showed a tendency to overestimate the flood peaks on the other hand it accentuated the tendency to generate noise in predictions the bi lstm model well predicted floods in some cases while in other cases it provided inaccurate forecasts with underestimated peaks and a slight time delay in the case of the wilson river both models and especially the bi lstm provided an underestimation of the peak flow rates in the case of the trent river both models predicted floods with a slight time delay in addition floods were underestimated by the stacked rf mlp model but not by the bi lstm however the accuracy of both models underwent a more or less significant decrease compared to the results shown above focusing on the testing stage in the case of the bacchiglione river for the stacked model r2 reduced from 0 807 to 0 773 the rmse increased from 11 47 m3 s to 12 43 m3 s while the mape increased from 11 48 to 15 26 on the other hand mda increased from 69 33 to 72 25 as for bi lstm r2 decreased from 0 799 to 0 723 rmse increased from 12 78 m3 s to 15 49 m3 s and mape increased from 12 71 to 16 94 instead mda increased from 67 96 to 70 64 more notable was the reduction in performance in the case of the raccoon river for the stacked model r2 decreased from 0 823 to 0 623 mda decreased from 64 30 to 63 07 rmse increased from 5 32 m3 s to 9 78 m3 s while mape increased from 59 42 to 95 37 regarding bi lstm r2 decreased from 0 882 to 0 733 mda decreased from 62 01 to 57 57 rmse increased from 3 65 m3 s to 5 61 m3 s and mape increased from 21 65 to 30 32 the decrease in performance of the two models was also significant in the case of the wilson river and the trent river for the values of the metrics see table 4 as for the 3 days ahead forecasts the comparison between the two models led to results similar to those obtained for the 2 days ahead prediction the stacked rf mlp model was more accurate than the bi lstm model in the case of the bacchiglione river but was less accurate in the case of the raccoon river while conflicting evaluations were provided by metrics regarding the wilson river and the trent river in any case the forecasting capabilities of the two models were still generally comparable as far as the bacchiglione river is concerned both models once again proved to be able to predict floods well but underestimated the peak flow rates underestimation is more marked for the bi lstm model in the case of the raccoon river the predictions of both models had low accuracy and the worst results were provided by the stacked rf mlp model regarding the wilson river flow rates both models were able to predict floods occurring but both underestimated the peak flows the underestimation could also be significant for the bi lstm model finally as regards the trent river both models showed that they were able to predict flood peaks with good accuracy but generally with a slight time delay compared to the observed event as indicated by the metric values shown in table 5 for the 3 day ahead forecasts the accuracies of both models underwent a further significant decrease in the testing stage the worst values of the metrics were obtained for the raccoon river r2 0 525 rmse 13 29 m3 s mda 60 69 mape 114 16 in the case of stacked rf mlp model r2 0 622 rmse 6 81 m3 s mda 57 70 mape 35 44 in the case of bi lstm the partially unsatisfactory forecasts obtained for the raccoon river can be attributed to the underfitting of the model probably the length of the time series initially considered together with some characteristics of the same i e high iqr and high number of outliers did not ensure a satisfactory training of the models therefore since daily flow rate data from 1 january 1997 to 31 december 2021 are available for the raccoon river two additional forecast models have been developed for this river based on the extended time series of the flow rates which is characterized by the following statistical parameters mean 67 03 m3 s median 28 23 m3 s standard deviation 99 11 m3 s iqr 71 87 m3 s and skewness 3 37 considering again 90 of the data for training and 10 for testing and adopting the same values of the previously selected hyperparameters the results shown in table 6 and in fig 13 were obtained as for the 1 day ahead forecasts both models provided excellent and practically equivalent results as regards the 2 day ahead forecasts they were still very accurate with the stacked model underestimating some flood peaks likewise the 3 days ahead forecasts were also very good the forecast accuracy was high for both high and low flow rates and the decline in accuracy as the forecast horizon increases was considerably smaller the stacked model outperformed bi lstm according to r2 and rmse while the performances were practically equivalent according to the mda and the mape it will be interesting to investigate in the future developments of this research the potential of models trained on long time series versus more distant time horizons 4 discussion further insight into the accuracy of the models was provided by examining the box plots of fig 14 in which the relative error absolute error actual value of the two models for the different case studies has been shown from the above plots the following can be deduced with some exceptions both models were characterized by a bias which was generally negligible or small for the 1 day ahead forecasts while it could be significant for the 2 days ahead and especially 3 days ahead forecasts from this point of view the best results were obtained for the bacchiglione river and the trent river the bias was generally greater for models based on the stacked rf mlp algorithm most of the outliers were positive overestimates and concerned with the forecasts of minimum flow rates with reference to the single case studies the greatest number of outliers was found in the case of the raccoon river considering the initial time series it is important to specify that for reasons of graphic scale the plot of fig 14b has been truncated at the top the stacked model has some other outliers with a value greater than 2 the iqr of the relative error amplified as the forecast horizon increased the distribution of the relative error in both models was asymmetrical in many cases the poor performance of the stacked model in terms of relative error for the wilson river can be attributed to the poor results achieved in this case study in predicting low flow rates this further analysis helps the understanding of the results described above in terms of metrics stacking ensemble learning has been very little used for streamflow forecasting so far the super ensemble learning model proposed by tyralis et al 2021 was based on the stacking algorithm even if in reality the authors did not introduce a meta learner but combined the results of the base learners by means of a weighted sum the authors considered 10 different base learners obtaining a very variable forecast accuracy in a large number of watercourses investigated however values of r2 were mostly in the range 0 60 0 65 lee and ahn 2021 developed a model based on four base learners svm gradient boosting machine gbm cubist and bayesian regularized neural networks brnn quantile regression was adopted as a meta learner the accuracy of the forecasts was good in the short term but not high furthermore it decreased as the forecast horizon increased as in this study the remarkable accuracy of lstm based models in predicting streamflow is already known in the literature even if the applications are still limited in number ahmed et al 2021 achieved excellent results with a brf lstm model but the aforementioned model requires a large number of climate indices as predictors in addition the model was developed specifically for the murray darling basin australia a forecasting model of the streamflow based on bi lstm was also developed by le et al 2021 as part of a study aimed at comparing different deep learning algorithms in predicting the flow rates of the red river in vietnam considering a 19 year time series the authors obtained results comparable to the best results of this study also detecting a decline in performance as the forecast horizon increased overall this study found that a streamflow prediction model based on the stacking of rf and mlp algorithms can lead to results comparable to those of a more complex model based on bi lstm especially as regards flood forecasting the great advantage of the stacked model lies in the calculation times which are in the order of 10 of those required by the bi lstm model in all the case studies as the forecast horizon increased from 1 to 3 days both models retained a good ability to predict floods in some cases both showed a slight tendency to underestimate the peaks however for the purposes of civil protection the problem can be partially overcome by using the forecast model iteratively updating the forecasts day by day the raccoon river case study shows that a predictive model of the flow rates of a river characterized by considerable variability may require a training dataset consisting of a time series of at least 20 25 years accuracy is significantly affected by the length of the time series as also highlighted by fu et al 2020 the simulations showed that the effectiveness of the forecasting models is not affected by the river regime however the greater variance of the input dataset and the greater number of outliers in the time series can reduce the accuracy of forecasting models as observed for the raccoon river in addition the results of this study did not show a dependence on the skewness of the time series of the flow rates however the influence of the intrinsic variability characteristics of time series on the accuracy of forecasting models will be the subject of future developments in this research furthermore future developments of this research will be aimed at obtaining more general and detailed results through large scale simulations in the real world using hundreds of time series from different locations one of the main limitations of this study is to not consider the spatial distribution of rainfall on the catchment area but to rely on the rainfall measured at a single station the choice of rain gage can affect the accuracy of the forecast model this question will be explored in a future study another noteworthy limitation is represented by the not having investigated rivers that flow in areas with arid climate 5 conclusions this study introduced a novel forecast model of daily flow rate based on the stacking of the random forest and multilayer perceptron algorithms and proposed an in depth comparison with a more complex model based on bidirectional long short term memory network the hyperparameters of the models were selected using a bayesian optimization algorithm the two forecasting models were compared by investigating four different case studies the bacchiglione river the raccoon river the wilson river and the trent river the two models demonstrated comparable forecasting capabilities in many cases the stacked model outperformed the model based on bidirectional lstm networks in predicting the highest flow rates but proved to be significantly less accurate in predicting low flow rates the forecast accuracy of both models decreased as the forecast horizon increased although the decrease was significantly affected by the length of the time series the stacked model has been characterized in some cases by a not negligible and increasing bias with the forecast horizon however it has the notable advantage of much shorter computation times than the bidirectional lstm model the forecasting capacities were not conditioned by the hydrological regime of the river although the dependence on some peculiar characteristics of the time series such as variance and skewness remains to be investigated in depth the proposed ensemble model is accurate based on few parameters and not at all time consuming in the context of current research which shows a marked tendency towards increasingly complex models characterized by a high number of predictors and parameters the proposed model can be considered as an effective tool to address both flood protection and water resource management problems provided that a large enough

2964,prediction of river flow rates is an essential task for both flood protection and optimal water resource management the high uncertainty associated with basin characteristics hydrological processes and climatic factors affecting river flows make streamflow prediction a very challenging problem these reasons together with the increasingly wide availability of data relating to flow rates and rainfall frequently lead to a preference for data driven models over physically based or conceptual forecasting models this study shows the results of an in depth comparison between two different daily streamflow prediction models a novel simpler model based on the stacking of the random forest and multilayer perceptron algorithms using the elastic net algorithm as meta learner and a more complex model based on bi directional long short term memory lstm networks bayesian optimization was employed in selecting hyperparameters the two prediction models were compared through the analysis of four different case studies the bacchiglione river the raccoon river the wilson river and the trent river the two models showed comparable forecasting capabilities in the most favourable cases both models demonstrated very high accuracy r2 greater than 0 93 mean absolute percentage error approximately equal to 10 the stacked model outperformed the bi directional lstm network model in several cases in predicting peak flow rates but was less accurate in forecasting low flow rates in addition its computation times are significantly shorter the prediction accuracy of both models decreased as the forecast horizon increased the length of the time series plays an essential role in developing models with satisfactory forecasting capabilities in this study the effectiveness of forecasting models was not influenced by the river regime however a high variance of the input dataset and a large number of outliers in the time series can reduce the accuracy of prediction models keywords streamflow forecasting machine learning stacking bidirectional lstm data availability the data used are freely available online 1 introduction streamflow prediction with particular interest for floods and low flows is a matter of great practical interest both from a technical and socio economic point of view river flood forecasting is essential for risk management and for ensuring public safety on the other hand the prediction of low river flows is crucial to optimize water resources management and to assess the risk of drought ostad ali askari et al 2017a the effects of climate change which make both floods and low flow periods more frequent and severe increase the need for reliable forecasting models fatahi nafchi et al 2021 villarini wasko 2021 saedi et al 2022 accurate streamflow prediction is a complex task that can be addressed by physically based conceptual and data driven models the physically based models are based on several mathematical equations describing the hydrological processes representative of the basin s response to precipitation events the conceptual models are based on a simplification of the processes and on empirical equations between hydrological parameters the high uncertainty associated with catchment characteristics rainfall runoff processes flow paths precipitation and other climatic factors affecting river flows has gradually led researchers to increasingly consider data driven forecasting models instead of physically based and conceptual models in particular artificial intelligence algorithms have been extensively used in recent years in the development of forecasting models of hydrological quantities e g nourani et al 2008 adamowski chan 2011 deo et al 2017 yaseen et al 2019 adnan et al 2020 granata di nunno 2021a

boucher et al 2010 shiri kisi 2010 rasouli et al 2012 kisi et al 2012 a comprehensive review of many valuable articles on streamflow forecasting in the 2000 2015 period was carried out by yaseen et al 2015 artificial neural network ann was probably the most popular algorithm in streamflow prediction in those years ostad ali askari et al 2017b although in some cases it was not the most accurate shortridge et al 2016 in recent years referring to the daily streamflow the researchers efforts have been mainly oriented towards improving predictions through the development of ensemble models or hybrid models papacharalampous et al 2019 compared several stochastic and machine learning methods for the multi step ahead forecasting of hydrological processes by executing large scale computational experiments based on simulations under the assumptions of linearity and stationarity proving that stochastic and machine learning methods can be considered equally useful in univariate short time series forecasting at large time scales in addition the authors conducted a large scale real world experiment based on 405 mean annual river discharge time series this latter experiment did not assume linearity parisouj et al 2020 compared prediction models of daily and monthly streamflow based on support vector regression svr ann and extreme learning machine elm for 4 rivers in the united states showing that the svr model led to better results than the elm and ann saraiva et al 2021 performed a comparative analysis of ann and svr coupled with wavelet transform and data resampling with the bootstrap method in forecasting daily streamflow into sobradinho reservoir brazil the authors showed that the ann based models were more accurate than the svm based ones tyralis et al 2021 used super ensemble learning for one step ahead daily streamflow forecasting combining 10 different machine learning algorithms the super ensemble learning algorithm outperformed all base learners the best of which was the ann model the study was performed considering a large dataset comprising 10 years of daily data from 511 basins having noted the good performance provided by models based on neural networks more recently some authors have developed predictive models of the streamflow based on deep learning algorithms cheng et al 2020 conducted long lead time streamflow forecasting using both ann and lstm at daily and monthly scales they highlighted that the lstm model was superior to the ann based model in the daily streamflow forecasting for a long lead time feng et al 2020 proposed a flexible data integration to improve streamflow forecasting using lstm in 671 catchments of the united states finding that the greatest benefits of integration were obtained in regions with high autocorrelation in streamflow fu et al 2020 proposed a lstm based deep learning model to simulate streamflow in the kelantan river malaysia they found that the lstm based model showed high accuracy both in forecasting smooth streamflow in the dry season and rapidly fluctuant streamflow in the rainy season outperforming a classical neural network with back propagation ahmed et al 2021 developed

recurrent neural network rnn and svr outperforming all of them several other valuable studies based on machine learning algorithms have not been discussed in detail here just for the sake of brevity e

important limitation of the current literature is represented by the progressive trend towards increasingly complex models dependent on a large number of parameters and input data which often cannot be easily estimated or obtained such models can be computationally expensive furthermore the accuracy of the same can vary greatly depending on the case study it would therefore be very useful to have simple models based on few input variables and few parameters characterized by forecasting capabilities comparable to those of recently developed complex models with this in mind this research introduces a novel streamflow forecasting model developed by stacking two simple machine learning algorithms and tries to answer the following unresolved questions can this novel ensemble model provide results comparable to those of a more complex deep learning algorithm such as bidirectional lstm in daily streamflow prediction in particular are these models able to predict flood peaks and minimum flows accurately and promptly how does the performance of the models change as the forecast horizon increases stacking is an ensemble machine learning technique to combine multiple classification or regression models via a meta classifier stacking can harness the capabilities of a number of well performing models on a classification or regression task in order to outperform the individual models of the ensemble in making predictions the individual classification or regression models are developed based on the whole training dataset then a meta classifier is fitted based on the outputs meta features of the individual models in the ensemble the ensemble model was obtained by stacking the random forest rf and multilayer perceptron mlp algorithms elastic net en algorithm was used as meta learner rf is very accurate robust to outliers and has a low risk of overfitting on the other hand it is not suitable for dealing with many sparse features mlp can tackle complex nonlinear problems is fast in providing predictions after training and works well even with large input datasets however performance is greatly affected by the quality of the input dataset taken individually rf and mlp are generally not the best performing algorithms in predicting time series however the combination proposed in this study can significantly improve their forecasting capabilities to show the potential of the stacked algorithm it is compared with an algorithm recognized as one of the best performing for time series prediction problems lstm in its most advanced bidirectional variant for the sake of a greater generality of the results four different rivers were considered as case studies geographically distant and with different hydrological characteristics 2 materials and methods 2 1 stacking of random forest and multilayer perceptron as stated above random forest rf and multilayer perceptron mlp were used as the base learners while the elastic net en algorithm was chosen as the meta classifier to develop the stacked forecasting models rf breiman 2001 is an ensemble forecasting algorithm obtained by combining a set of individual regression trees in order to provide a single value of the target variable each individual regression tree breiman et al 2017 is characterized by a root node which includes the training dataset by internal nodes which specify conditions on the input variables and by leaves which represent the real values assigned to the target variables a regression tree model is developed through the recursive subdivision of the input data set into subsets a multivariable linear regression model provides predictions in each subset during the growth of the tree each branch is divided into smaller partitions evaluating all the possible subdivisions on each field and finding at each stage the split into two distinct partitions that minimizes the least squared deviation 1 r t 1 n t i t y i y m t 2 in which n t is the number of units in the node t yi is the value of the target variable in the i th unit and ym is the average value of the target variable in the node t r t gives an estimate of the impurity in each node the procedure ends when the minimum impurity is reached or if a different stopping rule occurs first a pruning process reduces the risk of overfitting each tree of the forest is developed from a different bootstrap of the training dataset furthermore in each node there is a random choice of only a part of the variables with respect to which to carry out the subdivision the number of these variables is constant throughout the development of the forest mlp is a class of feedforward artificial neural networks murtagh 1991 able to approximate any continuous function an mlp consists of three layers of nodes at least an input layer a hidden layer and an output layer the input layer includes the nodes receiving the input data each node in the hidden layer processes the values from the preceding layer using a weighted linear sum followed by a non linear activation function the last hidden layer passes the values to the output layer which transforms them into the final calculated values algorithm training is carried out using the backpropagation technique the neural networks used in this study had 1 hidden layer the sigmoid was selected as the activation function the squared error was chosen as the loss function elastic net zou hastie 2005 is a combination of the two most commonly employed regularized variants of linear regression the lasso least absolute shrinkage and selection operator and the ridge methods lasso also known as l1 regularization pursues the goal of selecting the most explanatory variables by introducing an absolute penalty to the ordinary least squares ols regression ridge regularization known as l2 regularization also introduces a penalty in the ols formulation penalizing square weights rather than absolute weights in this way large weights are penalized considerably and many small weights are distributed across the spectrum of features given a training dataset in which y y1 yn are the targets and x xij i 1 n j 1 p is the matrix of the predictors en algorithm aims to reduce the number of features but also to spread weights more robustly across the remaining features to achieve this the following problem must be solved 2 β arg min l λ 1 λ 2 β y x β λ 2 j 1 p β j 2 λ 1 j 1 p β j where βis the vector of the coefficients of the linear regression model while λ1 and λ 2 are fixed nonnegative values let α λ2 λ1 λ 2 the problem stated by equation 2 is equivalent to the following optimization problem 3 β arg min y x β 2 s u b j e c t t o 1 α j 1 p β j α j 1 p β j 2 t for some t therefore α is the fundamental parameter of the algorithm a flowchart illustrating the implementation of the model based on the stacking of rf and mlp is shown in fig 1 it can be shown that the elastic net can be reduced to a linear support vector machine zhou et al 2015 2 2 bidirectional long short term memory networks lstm networks hochreiter schmidhuber 1997 have proved to be particularly effective in solving complex problems involving time series of hydrological quantities granata di nunno 2021b an lstm layer is made up of a set of memory blocks connected in a recurring way each of them contains one or more recurrently connected memory cells and three multiplicative units the input the output and the forget gate which allow read write and reset operations for the cells the network can only interact with the cells through the gates each memory cell in the lstm network is interconnected through the hidden state h t referred to as short term memory and the cell state c t known as long term memory the representative equations of an lstm cell can be posed in the form 4 f t σ w f h t 1 w f i n p u t t b f 5 i t σ w i h t 1 w i i n p u t t b i 6 c t f t c t 1 i t tanh w c h t 1 w c i n p u t t b c 7 o t σ w o h t 1 w o i n p u t t b o 8 h t σ t tanh c t where ft represents the forget state it is the input gate state and ot is the output gate state while the weights and the biases associated to these gates are wf and bf wi and bi wo and bo respectively while wc and bc are the weight and the bias linked to the cell state through the cell state the lstm network is able to store crucial information for an extended period see fig 2 in standard lstm networks data processing is carried out in one direction forward while necessary information is stored or predicted based on previous data a bidirectional lstm graves schmidhuber 2005 has a more advanced architecture compared to standard lstm since data are processed simultaneously in both forward and reverse directions the output of the bidirectional lstm network at time step t is provided by a combination of two separate hidden levels where each hidden level represents a training sequence corresponding to the forward and reverse directions thus bidirectional lstm can learn both future and past information of the input sequence better than standard lstm obviously future information i e a later part of the time series is only available in the training stage in the prediction models developed in this study a dropout layer and a dense layer were added to the layers made up of lstm cells a dropout layer randomly sets input elements to zero with a given probability a dense layer is a layer that is deeply connected with its preceding layer and allows to change the dimensionality of the output from the preceding layer 2 3 case studies the four case studies considered fig 3 are the bacchiglione river italy the raccoon river iowa usa the wilson river oregon usa and the trent river uk the bacchiglione is a 118 km river in veneto northern italy it flows in the provinces of vicenza padua and the metropolitan city of venice it joins the brenta river in the locality of ca pasqua near chioggia in the south of the venetian lagoon then flows into the upper adriatic after 6 km mazzoleni et al 2018 bacchiglione river is fed by springs located in a transition plain between the gravelly piedmont plain and the clay silty sandy lower plain at 30 km north east of padua frequent floods of the river over the centuries have often caused serious damage to the city of vicenza submerging entire neighborhoods the average annual rainfall estimated at the vicenza rain gage is approximately equal to 1150 mm while the average annual temperature is equal to about 12 9 c daily measurements of river flow rate were collected at montegalda station where the river basin is about 2063 km2 flow rate and rainfall data were provided by the veneto regional agency for environmental prevention and protection www arpa veneto it the raccoon river is a 49 6 km tributary of the des moines river in central iowa upstream it flows from northwest to southeast as three streams north raccoon river middle raccoon river and south raccoon river if measured considering the longest of its three streams the north raccoon river its length increases to 364 km both north and middle raccoon rivers flow through a recently glaciated landform the des moines lobe with limited surface drainage and a low relief landscape prior 1991 instead the south raccoon river flows into an older pre illinoian landscape characterized by a well developed surface drainage system and higher relief jones and schilling 2011 the three streams converge in a single stream referred to as raccoon river which joins the des moines river at des moines city the average annual precipitation of the area is about 840 mm while the annual average temperature is 8 7 c daily measurements of river flow rate were collected at van meter station where the river basin is about 11976 km2 the wilson river is a 53 km long river that flows from the tillamook state forest to its mouth at the tillamook bay oregon the catchment area cover consists mainly of deciduous and evergreen forests the average annual precipitation is very high about 2250 mm at tillamook increasing dramatically in the coast range mountains to the east much higher than the average oregon and united states annual precipitation equal to about 695 mm and 765 mm respectively the wilson river flow rate changes significantly during the year with an average flow rate near tillamook that passes from about 3 m3 s in august to about 75 m3 s in december daily measurements of river flow rate were collected from a station located upstream of the city of tillamook where the river basin is about 600 km2 for both raccoon river and wilson river flow rate and rainfall data were provided by the u s geological survey https waterdata usgs gov the trent river is the third longest river in the united kingdom with a length of 298 km its headwater is in the staffordshire on the southern edge of the biddulph moor the river flows through different cities of the midlands from stoke on trent to nottingham before joining the ouse river at trent falls forming the humber estuary the latter empties into the north sea between the cities of hull yorkshire and immingham lincolnshire the river is also known for dramatic flooding which usually occurs after storms and spring snowmelt large and petts 1996 land use is predominantly rural with up to 70 of the basin given over to agriculture the average annual rainfall for the whole basin is about 720 mm lower than the average united kingdom and england annual rainfall equal to 1101 mm and 828 mm respectively the average flow rate passes from 0 6 m3 s in the upper reaches near stoke on trent to values of about 85 m3 s at colwick near nottingham due to the contribution of large tributaries including the sow and blithe near yoxall and the dove derwent and soar upstream of nottingham in addition the trent has marked variations in discharge during the year daily flow rate and rainfall data for the trent river collected at the colwick station where the river basin is about 12355 km2 were provided by the national river flow archive uk https nrfa ceh ac uk data search fig 4 and table 1 report the essential information to characterize the river regimes of the case studies see table 2 the bacchiglione river is characterized by higher flows in autumn and lower flows throughout the summer the raccoon river has its highest flow rates in early summer and its lowest during the winter months the wilson river has its maximum flows in the months of december and january while the flows become low in the summer months the trent river has the highest flows in the spring months and the lowest flows in the autumn months the bacchiglione river is characterized by the lowest interquartile range iqr 15 7 m3 s while the raccoon river has the highest iqr 86 79 m3 s the four rivers are characterized by clearly different regimes 2 4 evaluation metrics four different valuation metrics were used to estimate the accuracy of forecasting models the coefficient of determination root mean squared error mean directional accuracy and mean absolute percentage error coefficient of determination r2 is a statistical measure in a regression model that evaluates the goodness of fit of the model to the data by a number in the range 0 1 it is defined as 9 r 2 1 t f t y t 2 t y a y t 2 where ft is the foreseen value at time t yt is the observed value at time t and ya is the averaged value of the observed data root mean squared error rmse is a measure of the absolute error in which deviations are squared to prevent positive and negative values from cancelling each other out furthermore this measure amplifies the errors of greater value a characteristic that penalizes the models with the most significant errors 10 rmse t f t y t 2 n where n is the total amount of forecasting data in the time series mean directional accuracy mda compares the forecast direction upward or downward to the actual realized direction providing the probability that the forecasting model can detect the correct direction of the time series it is evaluated by the following equation 11 mda 1 n t 1 sgn y t y t 1 sgn f t y t 1 in which sgn is the sign function while 1 is the indicator function mean absolute percentage error mape is the average of the absolute percentage errors of the prediction model where the error is defined as actual value minus the predicted value percentage errors are considered without regard to sign to calculate mape 12 mape 100 n t y t f t y t 2 5 model development and optimization one of the essential problems to be faced in the development of any forecasting model concerns the optimal choice of input variables the streamflow forecast models developed in this study consider as input variables the lagged values of the flow rates and the lagged values of the rainfall measured at a rain gauge that is fairly representative of the precipitation in the basin the choice of the optimal number of lagged values of flow rate and precipitation as well as the selection of the optimal values of the hyperparameters was carried out by means of a bayesian optimization procedure a bayesian optimization method uses an objective function probability model to iteratively select sets of hyperparameters to evaluate a bayesian optimization process is characterized by five essential operations selection of the domain of the hyperparameters choice of the objective function which based on the values of the hyperparameters generates a score to be minimized choice of the surrogate model probability model of the objective function definition of a criterion called a selection function for choosing the next set of hyperparameters from the surrogate model identification of a history composed of pairs score hyperparameter used by the algorithm to update the surrogate model a more detailed description of the procedure is omitted here for the sake of brevity for further information please refer to the essential literature e g snoek et al 2012 in this study rmse was chosen as the score to be minimized tree structured parzen estimator tpe algorithm was selected as surrogate model while the expected improvement ei was adopted for selecting the next set of hyperparameters tpe is a sequential model based optimization that sequentially builds models to approximate the performance of hyperparameters based on observed data and then subsequently chooses new hyperparameters to test based on this model the ei algorithm favors the branch that leads to the largest amount of improvement upon a target here it should be pointed out that from a preliminary analysis of the 4 case studies the stacked model proved to be not very sensitive to the number of trees in the random forest and to the number of hidden nodes in the mlp algorithm therefore for simplicity the same value was chosen for the 4 different models also simplifying the optimization procedure the main hyperparameters of the forecasting models are shown in tab 2 based on the optimization process the forecast models for the four different case studies require the following values as input bacchiglione river q 8 q 7 q 1 h 5 h 4 h 1 raccoon river q 15 q 14 q 1 h 6 h 5 h 1 wilson river q 7 q 6 q 1 h 7 h 6 h 1 trent river q 12 q 11 q 1 h 5 h 4 h 1 where q p and h q are the lagged values of daily flow rate and daily precipitation respectively with lag equal to p and q the training of each model was carried out using 90 of the time series data while the test was conducted on the remaining 10 this subdivision led to the most accurate results the forecasting models were developed in python environment 3 results table 3 shows the values of the evaluation metrics for the forecast models of all the rivers considered with reference to the 1 day ahead flow rates the two forecasting algorithms are compared here with reference to each case study the study first considered time series of equal length for the four case studies the importance of the length of the training time series will be discussed below fig 5 shows the time series of the observed and predicted values of the flow rates for the bacchiglione river the stacked model of rf and mlp slightly outperformed the one based on bi lstm both in the training and testing stages tab 3 both models were able to predict the occurrence of floods in the testing phase however the stacked model predicted peak values closer to real ones moreover in the case of the stacked model in some events the forecasted peak values exceed those observed while the bi lstm model underestimated peak values in almost all cases in order to provide information on the accuracy of the two models in the different discharge ranges the histograms of fig 6 show respectively the mape evaluated in the 4 quartiles and the mape evaluated in the 1st and 10th decile of the test discharges it can be noted that the predictions made with bi lstm were characterized by a higher mape in the second third and fourth quartiles in addition the stacked model was characterized by greater accuracy in both the first and tenth decile thus proving to be more suitable for predicting both minimum and maximum flow rates fig 7 reports the time series of observed and predicted values of the flow rates in the raccoon river the stacked rf mlp model slightly outperformed the bi lstm based model in the training stage while the latter turned out to be more accurate in the testing stage tab 3 the stacked model showed a tendency to slightly overestimate the peak values which are instead accurately predicted by bi lstm the predictions of the stacked model were characterized by several sudden increases in range and in some cases even by peaks of small magnitude which were not reflected in the observed values the stacked model generated some noise in the predictions this occurrence explains the high value of the mape that characterizes the predictions of the stacked model in the testing stage the mape evaluation in the flow sub ranges fig 8 shows that the accuracies of the two models were similar with regard to the higher flow rates while the bi lstm was much more accurate in predicting the low flow rates of the raccoon river fig 9 shows the time series of observed and forecasted values of the flow rates in the wilson river also in this case both models provided very good forecasts however discordant evaluations were obtained from the metrics the stacked model was characterized by better values of r2 and rmse while bi lstm had better values of mape and mda both models showed a tendency to underestimate the maximum peak flow rates this tendency was more marked in the bi lstm model moreover fig 10 shows that the two models had practically the same accuracy in predicting the 4th quartile or 10th decile flow rates while the mape of the stacked model was considerably higher for the 1st quartile and 1st decile flow rates the time series of measured and predicted flows of the trent river in the testing phase are shown in fig 11 both models yielded very good outcomes for the trent river the values of r2 rmse and mape were fully satisfactory and in the testing stage the metrics had values similar to those of the training phase moreover both models demonstrated a remarkable ability to accurately predict both peak and minimum flow rates in addition the stacked model was characterized by lower mape values with reference to the 1st decile and 10th decile flow rates while the bi lstm model in turn led to lower mape values in the intermediate flow rates 2nd and 3rd quartile fig 12 considering the 2 days ahead forecasts the stacked rf mlp model outperformed the bi lstm model in the case of the bacchiglione river underperformed it in the case of the raccoon river while conflicting indications were obtained from the evaluation metrics regarding the wilson river and the trent river for the sake of brevity the time series diagrams in the testing stage are not shown however the following should be highlighted in the case of bacchiglione river both models were able to predict the occurrence of floods the stacked rf mlp model underestimated the peak flow rates in some cases overestimated them in other cases while the bi lstm model generally underestimated the peak flow rates as for the raccoon river the stacked model on the one hand showed a tendency to overestimate the flood peaks on the other hand it accentuated the tendency to generate noise in predictions the bi lstm model well predicted floods in some cases while in other cases it provided inaccurate forecasts with underestimated peaks and a slight time delay in the case of the wilson river both models and especially the bi lstm provided an underestimation of the peak flow rates in the case of the trent river both models predicted floods with a slight time delay in addition floods were underestimated by the stacked rf mlp model but not by the bi lstm however the accuracy of both models underwent a more or less significant decrease compared to the results shown above focusing on the testing stage in the case of the bacchiglione river for the stacked model r2 reduced from 0 807 to 0 773 the rmse increased from 11 47 m3 s to 12 43 m3 s while the mape increased from 11 48 to 15 26 on the other hand mda increased from 69 33 to 72 25 as for bi lstm r2 decreased from 0 799 to 0 723 rmse increased from 12 78 m3 s to 15 49 m3 s and mape increased from 12 71 to 16 94 instead mda increased from 67 96 to 70 64 more notable was the reduction in performance in the case of the raccoon river for the stacked model r2 decreased from 0 823 to 0 623 mda decreased from 64 30 to 63 07 rmse increased from 5 32 m3 s to 9 78 m3 s while mape increased from 59 42 to 95 37 regarding bi lstm r2 decreased from 0 882 to 0 733 mda decreased from 62 01 to 57 57 rmse increased from 3 65 m3 s to 5 61 m3 s and mape increased from 21 65 to 30 32 the decrease in performance of the two models was also significant in the case of the wilson river and the trent river for the values of the metrics see table 4 as for the 3 days ahead forecasts the comparison between the two models led to results similar to those obtained for the 2 days ahead prediction the stacked rf mlp model was more accurate than the bi lstm model in the case of the bacchiglione river but was less accurate in the case of the raccoon river while conflicting evaluations were provided by metrics regarding the wilson river and the trent river in any case the forecasting capabilities of the two models were still generally comparable as far as the bacchiglione river is concerned both models once again proved to be able to predict floods well but underestimated the peak flow rates underestimation is more marked for the bi lstm model in the case of the raccoon river the predictions of both models had low accuracy and the worst results were provided by the stacked rf mlp model regarding the wilson river flow rates both models were able to predict floods occurring but both underestimated the peak flows the underestimation could also be significant for the bi lstm model finally as regards the trent river both models showed that they were able to predict flood peaks with good accuracy but generally with a slight time delay compared to the observed event as indicated by the metric values shown in table 5 for the 3 day ahead forecasts the accuracies of both models underwent a further significant decrease in the testing stage the worst values of the metrics were obtained for the raccoon river r2 0 525 rmse 13 29 m3 s mda 60 69 mape 114 16 in the case of stacked rf mlp model r2 0 622 rmse 6 81 m3 s mda 57 70 mape 35 44 in the case of bi lstm the partially unsatisfactory forecasts obtained for the raccoon river can be attributed to the underfitting of the model probably the length of the time series initially considered together with some characteristics of the same i e high iqr and high number of outliers did not ensure a satisfactory training of the models therefore since daily flow rate data from 1 january 1997 to 31 december 2021 are available for the raccoon river two additional forecast models have been developed for this river based on the extended time series of the flow rates which is characterized by the following statistical parameters mean 67 03 m3 s median 28 23 m3 s standard deviation 99 11 m3 s iqr 71 87 m3 s and skewness 3 37 considering again 90 of the data for training and 10 for testing and adopting the same values of the previously selected hyperparameters the results shown in table 6 and in fig 13 were obtained as for the 1 day ahead forecasts both models provided excellent and practically equivalent results as regards the 2 day ahead forecasts they were still very accurate with the stacked model underestimating some flood peaks likewise the 3 days ahead forecasts were also very good the forecast accuracy was high for both high and low flow rates and the decline in accuracy as the forecast horizon increases was considerably smaller the stacked model outperformed bi lstm according to r2 and rmse while the performances were practically equivalent according to the mda and the mape it will be interesting to investigate in the future developments of this research the potential of models trained on long time series versus more distant time horizons 4 discussion further insight into the accuracy of the models was provided by examining the box plots of fig 14 in which the relative error absolute error actual value of the two models for the different case studies has been shown from the above plots the following can be deduced with some exceptions both models were characterized by a bias which was generally negligible or small for the 1 day ahead forecasts while it could be significant for the 2 days ahead and especially 3 days ahead forecasts from this point of view the best results were obtained for the bacchiglione river and the trent river the bias was generally greater for models based on the stacked rf mlp algorithm most of the outliers were positive overestimates and concerned with the forecasts of minimum flow rates with reference to the single case studies the greatest number of outliers was found in the case of the raccoon river considering the initial time series it is important to specify that for reasons of graphic scale the plot of fig 14b has been truncated at the top the stacked model has some other outliers with a value greater than 2 the iqr of the relative error amplified as the forecast horizon increased the distribution of the relative error in both models was asymmetrical in many cases the poor performance of the stacked model in terms of relative error for the wilson river can be attributed to the poor results achieved in this case study in predicting low flow rates this further analysis helps the understanding of the results described above in terms of metrics stacking ensemble learning has been very little used for streamflow forecasting so far the super ensemble learning model proposed by tyralis et al 2021 was based on the stacking algorithm even if in reality the authors did not introduce a meta learner but combined the results of the base learners by means of a weighted sum the authors considered 10 different base learners obtaining a very variable forecast accuracy in a large number of watercourses investigated however values of r2 were mostly in the range 0 60 0 65 lee and ahn 2021 developed a model based on four base learners svm gradient boosting machine gbm cubist and bayesian regularized neural networks brnn quantile regression was adopted as a meta learner the accuracy of the forecasts was good in the short term but not high furthermore it decreased as the forecast horizon increased as in this study the remarkable accuracy of lstm based models in predicting streamflow is already known in the literature even if the applications are still limited in number ahmed et al 2021 achieved excellent results with a brf lstm model but the aforementioned model requires a large number of climate indices as predictors in addition the model was developed specifically for the murray darling basin australia a forecasting model of the streamflow based on bi lstm was also developed by le et al 2021 as part of a study aimed at comparing different deep learning algorithms in predicting the flow rates of the red river in vietnam considering a 19 year time series the authors obtained results comparable to the best results of this study also detecting a decline in performance as the forecast horizon increased overall this study found that a streamflow prediction model based on the stacking of rf and mlp algorithms can lead to results comparable to those of a more complex model based on bi lstm especially as regards flood forecasting the great advantage of the stacked model lies in the calculation times which are in the order of 10 of those required by the bi lstm model in all the case studies as the forecast horizon increased from 1 to 3 days both models retained a good ability to predict floods in some cases both showed a slight tendency to underestimate the peaks however for the purposes of civil protection the problem can be partially overcome by using the forecast model iteratively updating the forecasts day by day the raccoon river case study shows that a predictive model of the flow rates of a river characterized by considerable variability may require a training dataset consisting of a time series of at least 20 25 years accuracy is significantly affected by the length of the time series as also highlighted by fu et al 2020 the simulations showed that the effectiveness of the forecasting models is not affected by the river regime however the greater variance of the input dataset and the greater number of outliers in the time series can reduce the accuracy of forecasting models as observed for the raccoon river in addition the results of this study did not show a dependence on the skewness of the time series of the flow rates however the influence of the intrinsic variability characteristics of time series on the accuracy of forecasting models will be the subject of future developments in this research furthermore future developments of this research will be aimed at obtaining more general and detailed results through large scale simulations in the real world using hundreds of time series from different locations one of the main limitations of this study is to not consider the spatial distribution of rainfall on the catchment area but to rely on the rainfall measured at a single station the choice of rain gage can affect the accuracy of the forecast model this question will be explored in a future study another noteworthy limitation is represented by the not having investigated rivers that flow in areas with arid climate 5 conclusions this study introduced a novel forecast model of daily flow rate based on the stacking of the random forest and multilayer perceptron algorithms and proposed an in depth comparison with a more complex model based on bidirectional long short term memory network the hyperparameters of the models were selected using a bayesian optimization algorithm the two forecasting models were compared by investigating four different case studies the bacchiglione river the raccoon river the wilson river and the trent river the two models demonstrated comparable forecasting capabilities in many cases the stacked model outperformed the model based on bidirectional lstm networks in predicting the highest flow rates but proved to be significantly less accurate in predicting low flow rates the forecast accuracy of both models decreased as the forecast horizon increased although the decrease was significantly affected by the length of the time series the stacked model has been characterized in some cases by a not negligible and increasing bias with the forecast horizon however it has the notable advantage of much shorter computation times than the bidirectional lstm model the forecasting capacities were not conditioned by the hydrological regime of the river although the dependence on some peculiar characteristics of the time series such as variance and skewness remains to be investigated in depth the proposed ensemble model is accurate based on few parameters and not at all time consuming in the context of current research which shows a marked tendency towards increasingly complex models characterized by a high number of predictors and parameters the proposed model can be considered as an effective tool to address both flood protection and water resource management problems provided that a large enough
