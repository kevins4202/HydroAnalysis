12270,legal framework is very crucial to protect the vital resources to provide rights to public and administration to support national policy and to bring technological intervention to ensure equitable distribution fair management and effective decision making in bangladesh groundwater is not directly priced other than pumping costs perhaps such issue is not surprising that users do not meter the volumes of water usage beside the industry agricultural sector is by far the biggest groundwater consumer of this country contributing significant amount of annual meter drop in the groundwater table to the annual decline of groundwater table additionally the groundwater resources are severely affected by pollution encroachment and overexploitation national water policy 1999 and bangladesh water act 2013 are considered as country s pivotal legal framework but both of these lag behind to provide effective guidelines on permission extraction limit monitoring protection of quality water harvesting procedure and recharge mechanism existing institutions suffer from consistent crisis politics corruption absence of public participation and coordination of other institutions

management the present paper also provides an overview of established practices around the world to cope with the common challenges graphical abstract fx1 keywords water law groundwater law pollution control abstraction control governance water management institutions 1 introduction groundwater is considered as one of the most valuable water resources for its quality and quantity around the world agriculture industry and domestic usages are highly reliant on groundwater for its availability quality and low cost for abstraction increasing population growth rapid and unplanned urbanization and industrialization flourishing economic development food security and impact of climate change are putting unprecedented pressure on groundwater consumption uncsd 2012 efforts to address the key challenges are common in developing countries but it is also remain superficial in developing countries lack of attention no strict legislation and ineffective institution to manage groundwater are common in developing and underdeveloped countries mechlem 2016 it is well acknowledged that effective governance is the prerequisite for a sound water resource management governance which is of both legal framework and functions of governmental institutions provide a clear direction for the usage and allocation of resources through a transparent and accountable processes green et al 2015 reichert et al 2015 groundwater governance exists different ways in across the world many countries of asia africa and south america adopt informal or customary laws to protect and manage their groundwater developed countries put enormous efforts to address the key challenges for inclusive integrated and equitable distribution of water resources modern water law of developed countries considers comprehensive approaches with clear definitions standards management tools protection measures and research based finding for effective management in recent years bangladesh has achieved remarkable economic growth this achievement is primarily attributed to industrial revolution and significant increase of agriculture productivity dorosh 2006 consequently country s water resources are tremendously affected by traditional agricultural practices through excessive water withdrawal poor sanitation system pollution and impact of climate change freshwater scarcity not only manifests in the form of downturn of groundwater tables reduced river flows shrinking lakes and heavily polluted waters but also increases costs of supply and treatment intermittent supplies and conflicts on water in 1992 bangladesh government adopted water resource planning act water resources planning organization warpo a multidisciplinary organization came into an existence in 1992 through water resource planning act to manage country s water resource planning until 1996 warpo was mainly involved with flood control and development of nationwide flood protection action plan flood plan coordination organization fpco and warpo were merged on 1996 to formulate national scale water policy eventually country s first water related policy national water policy was published on 1999 afterwards a number of plans were implemented to support this policy in 2013 government introduced bangladesh water act to ensure effective water governance including groundwater bangladesh water development board bwdb is responsible for managing country s overall water resource with the cooperation of other governmental ministries this review article aimed to identify the key priorities for groundwater governance in bangladesh and to providing insights of relevant legislations for fostering integrated water resource management bangladesh water act national water policy and environmental act are considered as key legislations for country s water resource management this present article will discuss the insights of these legislations on groundwater protection also this study will provide an overview of existing practices of groundwater governance in different parts of the world special laws with the development of modern environment friendly techniques may reduce the impacts of these modern activities thus relevant regulations are necessary to protect the quality and quantity of groundwater to ensuring sustainable conservation are beyond the scope of this paper 2 physical context and climate bangladesh is a riverine country because of a network of 230 tributaries and distributaries is considered as one of the largest deltas of the world named as bengal delta qureshi et al 2015 this delta is largely formed by alluvium and deltaic sediment deposition of ganges brahmaputra and meghna rivers mukherjee and bhattacharya 2001 majumder et al 2013 in general four major physiographic units exist in bengal delta which are a tertiary sediments in the hilly areas b pleistocene terraces in the madhupur and barind tracts c holocene floodplains of the ganges brahmaputra and meghna rivers d the delta covering the rest of the country fig 1 ahmed et al 2004 zahid and ahmed 2006 unconsolidated pleistocene and holocene sediments are considered as the most productive aquifer 82 aquifer are covered by holocene sediments kinniburgh and smedley 2001 zahid and ahmed 2006 majumder et al 2013 in 1982 bwdb and united nation development program undp identified and named three major aquifers of bengal delta fig 2 zahid and ahmed 2006 these three major aquifers composite or shallow main or intermediate and deep are considered as the main source of groundwater in this country below surface shallow aquifer are mostly composed by silt and clay the depth of this aquifer is ranged between few meters in north to 60 m in south matin 1989 farmers ordinarily abstract water for irrigation from these aquifers intermediate or main aquifer places between shallow and deep aquifer comprises medium and coarse grained sand sediments in places with inter bedded with gravel the depth of this aquifer is ranged from 5 m in the north to 140 m in the south large industries install deep tubewell dtw to abstract water from this water bearing zone deep aquifer situated beneath the intermediate or main aquifer it is comprised of medium to coarse sand in places and inter bedded with fine silt and clay depth of this zone is ranged from 190 m to 1500 m zahid and ahmed 2006 deep aquifer contains high level of iron manganese and chloride an aquitard of clay deposit is positioned beneath the main aquifer groundwater level is generally high in north but it is usually low in southern part and sylthet depression area mpo 1987 transboundary rivers of india and myanmar carry huge amount of water and sediments fig 3 about 95 water originates outside of the country therefore the availability of the water is equally proportionate to each year ahmed et al 2001 estimated total renewable water resources are 1226 600 mm3 year 1 including 84 000 mm3 year 1 of surface water 21 000 mm3 year 1 of groundwater and 1121 600 mm3 year 1 of cross boundary river water flows fao 2011a 2011b rajmohan and prathapar 2013 during monsoon season june to september country witnesses about 80 of rainfall have been occurred in post monsoon and pre monsoon seasons bangladesh has 1200 mm average annual rainfall throughout the year chowdhury 2010 in recent years the mean rainfall decreases sharply in post monsoon season and significant changes are noted in daily basis occurrence of rainfall rana et al 2007 groundwater recharge mostly depends on seepage of rainfall and only small portion 0 04 of total recharge is done though river water mpo 1987 it was estimated that 11 of the total rainfall recharges the groundwater and the rest are lost due to evaporation and drainage to the nearest water bodies jahan et al 2010 the average infiltration rate is 1 2 mm day to 7 5 mm day in different parts of bangladesh sir macdonald and partners 1983 depending upon rainfall exploitation and seasonal variation the yearly groundwater level fluctuates in 4 23 6 26 mm each year ahmed 1996 usually groundwater recharge starts on late october and ends on mid of december as bangladesh has the shortest monsoon period and soil with poor water holding capacity 3 declination of groundwater table and water quality in bangladesh country s agrarian based structure dominates the overall economy and the structure contributes 18 6 of total gdp bangladesh bureau of statistics 2012 irrigation is considered as a pivotal precondition to enhance the agriculture production local farmers mostly practice small scale irrigation procedure prior to 1970s country s agriculture was highly reliant on surface water to produce rice undp 1982 boro rice is considered as a high yielding rice which grows during dry season december april and requires 0 4 1 5 m of irrigation ravenscroft et al 2009 government ngos and private sectors installed millions of drinking tubewell hand tubewell htw and shallow irrigation tubewell stw under clean drinking water decade and watsan programme these programs were aimed of increasing productivity of boro rice and shifting the source of drinking water warpo 2000 bgs bgs british geological survey and dphe department of public health and engineering 2001 world bank 2005a 2005b 2005c ministry of environment and forest 2012 these tubewells significantly improved irrigation practices and assisted to lessen waterborne diseases because people of bangladesh used to drink untreated surface water prior 1990s which was the main reason of high mortality rate among children due to different types of waterborne diseases e g diarrhoea cholera etc nowadays about 85 of total denizens of dhaka city and around 80 of country s total population use groundwater for drinking purpose moreover estimated 80 of total irrigation is done by groundwater general economic division 2015 groundwater consumption comparatively higher in north western and south western parts of the country and lowest in north eastern and south eastern districts fig 4 badc 2008 low manpower costs availability of water resources and supportive governmental legislations facilitate industrial growth in bangladesh textile tannery and steel are the main water consuming industries and they are highly reliant upon groundwater to produce products estimated 9500 000 m3 of groundwater is used annually by country s industrial sectors and the usage of groundwater has been increasing each year general economic division 2015 in addition to water quantity the effect of the industry on water quality remains a significant concern the textile industry uses around 2000 different chemicals as inputs auxiliaries in processing however most of the textile factories have improper or inefficient wastewater treatment facility as a result a significant amount of chemicals and salts are discharged into surface water and caused severe water and soil pollution world bank 2005a 2005b 2005c consequently surface water of industrial area becomes unusable for domestic agriculture and industrial activities by 2011 large portion of abstracted groundwater 88 are being used for irrigation or agricultural purpose hence agriculture sector is considered as the highest groundwater consumer in bangladesh fig 5 to support country s growing boro rice production the government and ngos have installed huge number of stw and deep tubewells dtw across the country the stw based irrigation area has increased into 3044 000 ha from 57 000 ha and dtw supplied area has also increased to 702 000 ha from 138 000 ha in 2007 in comparison with 1975 fig 6 groundwater fed irrigation is was found most common in northern parts and less common in the southern parts of the country fig 4 several studies have been conducted to assess potential shallow aquifer recharge status in bangladesh one of the important studies was conducted by international bank of reconstruction and development ibrd through separating effective rainfall and potential evaporation shamsudduha et al 2011 later undp carried out a comprehensive study where potential recharge was defined as a difference between surface runoff and potential evaporation fig 7a undp 1982 in 1987 and 1991 mpo estimated nationwide shallow aquifer recharge using finite difference recharge method fig 7b mpo 1987 1991 in this method physical hydrological and agricultural parameters were highly considered with other variables shamsudduha et al 2011 all of these studies fall short to properly measure the actual shallow aquifer recharge status in different parts of bangladesh for instance karim 1984 drilled several boreholes in north eastern districts and noticed that the actual recharge was lower than potential recharge karim 1984 besides in recent study in north eastern part of the country estimated the potential recharge found higher than actual recharge ravenscroft 2003 groundwater modeling studies by von brömssen et al 2014 in the matlab upazila indicated that the groundwater hydrology is characterized by a number of local flow systems in the shallow aquifers governed by local topographic variations as well as the pattern of rainfall in the region during the monsoon season however such detailed studies are needed to understand the hydrological flow systems at both local as well as regional scales 4 groundwater governance in different countries in many countries of the world water is considered as public wealth in islamic law groundwater is considered as public wealth but the ownership of a certain portion of water in well entails to its owners and rest is declared as forbidden considering this basic trait most of the muslim countries consider water as a community of interest caponera 2007 according to islamic law saudi arabia adopts similar kind of regulations to manage their water resources in 2001 ministry of water of saudi arabia became responsible for managing all types of water resources of this gulf country besides regulating the private ownership by imposing permits for drilling of wells and for imposing bans on drilling water stresses or over pumped areas fao 2009 like islamic law customary regimes considered groundwater as a community belonging and rejected the idea of private ownership bhutan namibia argentina mozambique paraguay tanzania and zambia acknowledge the customary water rights and grant water allocation for land tenure mozambique s water licensing regulation 2007 law on water resource paraguay 2007 argentina s water law of tucuman province 2001 water resource management act tanzania 2009 and namibia s water management act 2013 regard the customary water rights and regulate the unauthorized water withdrawal by introducing borehole license or permit burchi 2005 2011 in such laws governing authorities are empowered to monitor the water usages to limit water abstraction protecting the quality of groundwater in some cases governing authority declared that the quantity of water can be withdrawn annually from an aquifer edwards aquifer authority act 1993a 1993b ibraimo 1999 promulgation of water resource management act 2013 considering the sustainability of aquifer stirred by islamic and customary law many countries of the world impose different rules and regulations kenya kyrgyzstan the northern territory of australia oman philippines and costa rica enact permit for registration of borehole digging or drilling to protect groundwater from pollution and overexploitation additionally all of these countries introduce rules and guideline for construction maintenance and sealing of abandoned wells to manage the groundwater mechlem 2016 here government are the owner of all water resources including groundwater in 2016 british columbia province of canada enforces new water sustainability act where a user needs a license and thus pays necessary fees to abstract groundwater for nondomestic usage water sustainability act 2016 water metering is introduced to regulate the water usage and the users are advised to submit the water withdrawn data regularly to local authority harris 2003 in south asia and northern part of china small scale farmers are allowed to abstract water without having permission to irrigate small plots of 2 ha or less shah et al 2003 also bhutan has introduced bhutan water act 2011 to regulate the unsustainable water usage by imposing fees to abstract groundwater bhutan water act 2011 other parts of the world considered groundwater as a private ownership and allowed land owners to extract groundwater without any cost however people of different areas of pakistan india and bangladesh consider groundwater as private ownership due to lack of knowledge on water related acts and absence of strict enforcement or implementation of water laws as a consequence these countries experience indiscriminate use of groundwater garduno et al 2011 steenbergen et al 2015 5 water governance in bangladesh bangladesh has introduced several policies for water governance and sustainable usage of water arsenic contamination in groundwater is alarming in bangladesh hence arsenic mitigation policy and plan is introduced to facilitate the use of surface water instead of groundwater for drinking water this plan adheres the water quality standard as defined in other national standard government of bangladesh 2010 bangladesh water act 2013 is the newest water policy of this country absorbed under the national water policy 1999 the water act surpassed all the other direct water acts and created connection with relevant policies e g disaster management act 2012 coastal development strategy 2006 the coastal zone policy 2005 national policy for safe water supply sanitation 1998 government of bangladesh 1995 national forest policy 1994 groundwater management ordinance 1985 and the forest act 1927 wwf 2015 table 1 showed different water management laws in bangladesh in bangladesh water related policies are indiscriminate and not comprehensive in nature pal et al 2011 among all introduced policies environmental conservation act 1995 and bangladesh water act 2013 are considered as the key legal frameworks for water governance chan et al 2016 environmental conservation act 1995 provides detailed guideline for water management through formulation of standards and protective measures for surface water however this act fails to incorporate groundwater management government of bangladesh 1995 national water policy 1999 emphasises safe and clean groundwater for domestic agriculture and industrial usages bangladesh water act 2013 describes the roles and responsibilities of different stakeholders and highlights this inter ministerial cooperation for effective management there is no detailed guideline on monitoring and reporting ensuring private and public participation for decision making and infrastructure development for protecting groundwater and authorizing local governmental authority for community based management ministry of law justice and parliamentary affair 2013 table 2 described groundwater policy integration of major national water policies in bangladesh for water governance 6 key challenges for existing groundwater governance practices in bangladesh bangladesh is considered as one of the most disaster prone countries of the world each year many cyclones and flood hit the country these natural phenomena contaminate the surface water and threatening the public health in consequence citizens become reliant on groundwater to meet the needs of drinking water asaduzzaman et al 2010 besides safe drinking water remains a critical challenge for bangladesh as a consequence of arsenic contamination saha et al 2018 surface water pollution and salinity intrusion of coastal area it is well acknowledged from recent studies that arsenic is well enriched in upper aquifer of coastal plains moderately present in depressed land delta and flood plains and low in piedmont pleistocene uplands and tertiary hills mukherjee and bhattacharya 2001 von brömssen et al 2014 arsenic is mostly distributed at depth between 20 and 50 m and is less abundant at deeper than 150 m ahmed et al 2004 furthermore recent empirical studies on groundwater abstraction reveal that over use of groundwater pose arsenic contamination ministry of environment and forest 2012 dey et al 2017 naturally occurrence arsenic in groundwater significantly reduce the access of safe drinking water in different parts of the country hossain 2015 hossain et al 2015 2017 numerous literature reports have highlighted that the extensive presence of arsenic in groundwater in bangladesh 41 50 districts of 64 districts of bangladesh have arsenic concentration over 50 μg l ahmed et al 2004 hasan et al 2007 mukherjee and bhattacharya 2001 mukherjee et al 2008 von brömssen et al 2008 annaduzzaman et al 2018 yunus et al 2016 on top of natural phenomena current government policy accelerates the industrial growth by allowing indiscriminate groundwater use without permission and cost poses serious threat to sustainable groundwater consumption moreover water consumption scenario is often exacerbated by the lack of awareness in efficient manufacturing techniques and technologies therefore industries are highly depended on groundwater rather than reusing and minimising blue water consumption world bank 2005a 2005b 2005c like industrial sector agriculture plays an indispensable role on country s economy and food security government of bangladesh provides financial incentives for improving agricultural productivity the lower rate of electricity is considered as financial incentive for farmers and as a matter of fact it is no longer surprising that the irrigation hours in rural areas are so high this watering system is highly reliant upon groundwater abstraction mandal 2006 in recent years bangladesh s economy has been growing consistently on an average above of the blistering rate of more than 6 and such growth exacerbates the groundwater demand significantly significant numbers of policies are introduced for water allocation and demarcation but bureaucratic system delays the whole process it is said by different researches that country s most of the water policies were formulated without empirical assessment and introduced with inadequate training for local authorities hence country s policies fail to address the key challenges mandal 2006 roy and chan 2014 however industries are often accused of misusing groundwater excessively and polluting surrounding environment it is acknowledged that water resources are inseparably linked with global climate dynamics uncertainties accompany with climate change are likely to increase water demand additional effects of climate change that have important implications include the changes of monsoon pattern unpredictable rainfall distribution fall in water quality and an increase in temperature these create critical problems for water resource management world water assessment programme 2012 6 1 permission for groundwater abstraction in 1985 groundwater management ordinance was introduced in bangladesh to manage the groundwater this ordinance empowered the local government to permit renew or to cancel license of stw and dtw usage for irrigation however several key issues for instance detail engineering design protection from pollution monitoring of water withdrawal information conservation of groundwater in water stress areas and recharges were not included in this ordinance government of bangladesh gob suspended this ordinance to increase the agricultural production in 1992 and after that the local government authority lost the authorization to protect groundwater badc 2005 during 1990s to 2000s unplanned installation of stw and dtw rose significantly contributed to the rapid fall of groundwater level in different parts of bangladesh and threatened the sustainable agriculture development many countries around the world e g australia chile kenya oman namibia usa etc have introduced strict legislations to control groundwater usage to restrict the right to access groundwater information to allow permission for digging and to protect groundwater from pollution to control groundwater abstraction both chile and british columbia province of canada introduced taxes for industry and large scale farmers mechlem 2016 developing countries have introduced abstraction charge for withdrawing groundwater this charge can be adjustable for farmers but it has significant impact on controlling over extraction berbel et al 2007 in texas of usa edwards aquifer authority act precludes the withdrawal of more than 572 000 acre feet annually from entire aquifer edwards aquifer authority act 1993a 1993b besides jordan embraces comprehensive groundwater basin management plan where all wells are subject to be registered and monitored abstraction quota resource charges have also been introduced to limit the groundwater usage in jordan wijnen et al 2012 according to article no 4 3 of national water policy 1999 government reserves the ownership right of water resources including groundwater however this policy did not provide guidelines on granting permission for digging or bore holing for groundwater withdrawn bangladesh water act 2013 did not provide clear guideline of granting permission to protect the groundwater it is well proven from other country s policy that issuing license for borehole digging not only regulates unsustainable abstraction but also protects the quantity of this unseen resource moreover preliminary price or tax for groundwater use is an effective solution to minimize the overexploitation and monitor its usage according to recent water act government can cancel the permission of water withdrawn a certain area if safe yield level crosses the lowest level 6 2 inadequate measures for agriculture land surface zoning and changing agricultural pattern are often considered as important tools to recharge groundwater naturally land surface zoning makes industry and agriculture to limit water abstraction into certain level and ensures regular monitoring of water consumption it is known that cropping pattern and irrigation method play an important role to minimize groundwater usage it is evident that some native vegetation has the capacity to increase the recharge rate into one to two magnitudes taylor et al 2003 gob introduced national water policy and bangladesh water act with a view to regulate the unsustainable groundwater consumption through exercising water allocation based on specified priorities and water scarcity these legislations allow government to confer any private ownership on groundwater abstraction in drought prone or water stressed areas for adequate groundwater recharge for instance punjab and haryana states of india prohibited to sow paddy water before certain dates of may and june to avoid evaporation the punjab preservation of sub soil water act 2009 the haryana preservation of sub soil water act 2009 jordan introduced water strategy 2008 2022 to meet the water demands and equitable distribution of its underground water resources to the top prioritized areas for instance municipal industrial education and tourism areas for agricultural sectors prioritization of groundwater usage is given to those farmers who made high investment on water efficient irrigation system wijnen et al 2012 the productivity of the agriculture practices of bangladesh is mostly dependent on geographic location and monsoon transboundary rivers are interconnected with all the large rivers of this country and these rivers also bring huge amount of surface water and sediments from himalaya mountain bangladesh has several disputes with neighbouring countries on river water distribution therefore different parts of the country have already witnessed severe groundwater consumption rate especially during dry season like other countries bangladesh can weight on empirical assessment of early harvesting before embracing this technique extensively to evade pressure on groundwater consumption however none of introduced policies emphasized on sustainable agriculture practice and resource efficient technology for industry to minimize groundwater consumption strong crop diversification effective regulatory system for ago chemical use and appropriate monitoring procedure for groundwater use recharge and quality management are mentioned in article 4 7 of national water policy 1999 ministry of water resource 1999 6 3 groundwater quality protection and recharge over use of groundwater uncontrolled pesticide and fertilizer use disposal of untreated wastewater salinity intrusion inadequate or lack of guideline for artificial recharge are the common challenges for groundwater protection gob introduces many environmental legislations to protect this water resource effectively and efficiently bangladesh environmental conservation act 1995 national water policy 1999 and water act 2013 are considered as the key legislations for managing country s water resources by these legislations government authority is empowered to declare water stress zone to restrict the unsustainable abstraction to monitor the effluent treatment facility of industries to measure the quality of discharged effluent and to impose penalties for violating the environmental compliance article 4 6 of national water policy 1999 emphasises on recharge of aquifers and rainwater harvesting in urban areas however there is no specific action plans recharge methods and the name of the designated organization to manage groundwater in this act moreover all these key legislations fall short to provide guidelines on appropriate protecting measures for aquifer from salinity intrusion table 3 many countries consider groundwater as a finite important water resource therefore impose strict regulations for quality and quantity management for instance policy and strategy for groundwater quality management was adopted by south africa to protect its groundwater from adverse effect on mining industry domestic and agricultural activities this policy is an attempt to regulate the point pollution source and to foster the development of low waste and no waste technology republic of south africa 2000 additionally south africa enacted artificial recharge strategy during 2007 to improve the groundwater level where water tables have dropped significantly due to overuse this strategy comprises of seven themes including creating awareness optimizing management developing capacity for institutions cost effective artificial recharge method technological intervention and implementation accompanied by rejuvenating the recharging strategy republic of south africa 2007 similarly andhra pradesh of india adopted land water and trees act and rules in 2002 for rainwater harvesting in residential commercial and open area having no less than 200 m2 6 4 monitoring monitoring system is an indiscriminate part of effective groundwater governance and considered as a key component for water legislations to regulate the unsustainable consumption to improve the quality and quantity and to formulate appropriate plans for equitable distribution monitoring system plays a crucial role for relevant institutions as it provides guidelines to monitor interpret and store data for forecasting planning and proper management mechlem 2016 there is a direct association between intervention of scientific methods and modern technology with monitoring of groundwater table application of scientific tools instruments and software helps in estimating the present status of groundwater table abstraction behaviour recharging mechanism and pollution status once baseline data is available it facilitates the scientific based management and design programs to secure water rights and improve quality and quantity of water table moreover it helps to give permission or approval of water withdrawal from borehole limits the withdrawal amount and protects from pollution however monitoring is a technically demanding and costly exercise article 4 7 of national water policy 1999 emphasized on strengthening monitoring system of organizations to address groundwater recharge procedures current consumption status and quality of groundwater ministry of water resources 1999 country s only water act bangladesh water act 2013 emphasized on groundwater conservation but yet to provide adequate guideline 6 5 planning water legislations require up to date resource management plan for fair water management water management plan contains brief description of a country s aquifer and other hydrological resources surface and groundwater linkage consumption behaviour and significance of aquifer in many cases water management plants are introduced without giving due consideration of reliable information of water source and adequacy available for usage thus water crisis and mismanagement becomes grave issue in many parts of the world it is important to recognize the increasing demand and long term needs of dwellers water legislations of many developed countries e g morocco texas south australia south africa etc emphasized on water resource management plans and provide necessary guidelines for relevant governmental institutes van koppen 2007 edwards aquifer authority act 1993a 1993b provides specific guidelines on groundwater management plan formulation to edwards aquifer authority edwards aquifer authority act 1993a 1993b in andhra pradesh water land and tree act 2002 that provides guidelines to form an authority consisting of government officials professors and experts for water resource management planning authority is responsible for formulating guidelines to relevant governmental authorities on rain water harvesting and reuse government of andhra pradesh 2002 like other countries bangladesh emphasises heavily on water resource management plan to promote effective and fair management according to article 15 of bangladesh water act 2013 warpo has been authorized to draft national water resource plan nwrp for executive committee ministry of law justice and parliamentary 2013 warpo is responsible for incorporating several key issues including description of the water resource analysis of the social economic impacts on water resources scientific analysis of data development of infrastructure for water abstraction present condition of water use forecasting of future use surface and groundwater linkage present quantity and quality of water bangladesh water act provides guidelines on formation of executive committee discussion topic review alteration and approval bangladesh water act 2013 adequately addresses all the key steps for effective formulation of water resource management plan for maintaining balance between water demand and supply 6 6 managing other challenges environmental impact assessment is one of the prerequisites for new industrial establishment in bangladesh this principle is an attempt to address the adverse effect on any establishment in ecosystem water air and soil and to emphasize an appropriate environmental management system to minimize the environmental footprint existing establishments such as industries hospitals hotels etc are prescribed to produce their environmental impact assessment report for renewing licenses or permits government of bangladesh 1995 like bangladesh mexico jordan kenya paraguay and other countries include these key issues in water related regulations and make environmental impact assessment as an indispensable requirement for obtaining permit or license unep 2010 climate change is one of the major long term constraints for the economy and human civilization bangladesh experiences several adverse effects of climate change i e unpredictable flash flood occurrence in north eastern parts salinity intrusion in southern areas and changes in monsoon time in recent years in this regard gob adopted national adaption programme of action 2005 to incorporate the potential response measures to reduce the effect of climate change ministry of environment and forest 2005a 2005b this action plan fails to draw specific guidelines and responsibilities for government authorities to protect groundwater from salinity intrusion in 2009 bangladesh climate change strategy and action plan bccsap was introduced to develop programs for six pillars food security comprehensive disaster management infrastructure research and knowledge management mitigation and capacity building to reduce the climate change vulnerability bccsap specified that government funds and other external financial supports will facilitate the implementation procedures it details the financial technical and human resource supports for managing different programs hence bccsap is considered as country s one of the most comprehensive action plans for climate change adoption this plan highlights the development of climate resilient cropping system and minimization of groundwater abstraction ministry of environment and forest 2009 however it does not provide specific action plan on infrastructure development to recharge groundwater table chan et al 2016 like bangladesh bhutan uruguay south africa etc also have been recognizing the threat of climate change on water resource management and putting enormous efforts on development climate change adaption techniques for water resource management in many developed countries climate change has been considered as an indispensable part of water governance and included in the major water related legislations to abate its threat on water resource national action plans for climate change and water resource management are not interlinked in many countries of the world including bangladesh bangladesh is still lagging behind to incorporate climate change adaptation strategies into water acts mechlem 2016 6 7 politics bangladesh is one of the democratic countries of south asia undue influence of governing body and lack of technical supports and have made some weaker policies for groundwater management world bank 2005a 2005b 2005c bureaucratic complicacy is responsible for corruption and affects the overall policy development and administrative functions pahl wostl 2007 public may find difficulty to get access to water resource information which eventually blocks the participation of water users in policy development or reformation procedure world bank 2005a 2005b 2005c sometimes district wide water demand and supply are not properly assessed due to shortage of modern technology moreover lack of public participation comprehensive regulations and inadequate involvement of local authorities weaken the overall water resource management practices gupta 2011 dewan et al 2015 these shortfalls are susceptive to levitate water conflict and to weaken the functions of water institute in future 6 8 institutional support in bangladesh water resources planning organisation warpo bangladesh water development board bwdb and department of environment doe are predominately responsible for planning and managing country s water resources warpo delineates the hydrological resources and formulates long and short term plan to manage this resource bwdb is responsible for program management and coordination with different governmental organizations for infrastructure i e bridge dam etc development and maintenance additionally bwdb assesses the current and future water demand designs different water development programs administers water rights and provides technical inputs and reviews the national level perspective or development plans other than wpro and bwdb doe has completely different functions and responsibilities the main tasks of doe are to organize stakeholders for managing ecology monitoring water quality and quantity and enforcing the water law warpo often fails to address the key challenges of different areas of the country as a consequence developed programs sometime unable to bring enormous success moreover doe and bwdb are still lagging behind to establish strong coordination with other governmental ministries e g agriculture infrastructure forestry road transports etc therefore most of the programs and policies of water resource management suffer from consistent crisis and mismanagement nanni et al 2006 developing countries put notable efforts to develop an effective institution for workable solutions to these crisis and uncertainties most of the countries of the world have single water resource management institute with similar principles and functions to manage their water resources mechlem 2016 however an inter governmental inter agency mechanism is in a place to coordinate with other relevant ministries to develop plans strategies and implement programs additionally many countries form a committee or council or commission including local tenure and groundwater user groups or associations to identify ineffable challenges and take appropriate measures for instance chile mexico australia and usa enacted the legislation to establish user groups to manage groundwater mechlem 2016 in spain involvement of groundwater user organizations became compulsory by the spanish water law 1985 revised on 2001 for managing overexploited aquifer wijnen et al 2012 cotas or technical ground committees is formed by government of mexico as prescribed by mexican water law 1992 cotas are the civil society groups which are financially supported by public are addressing the challenges of groundwater management implementing the management plan establishing the dialog among different user groups improving the hydrological data providing support to groundwater user community assisting the public awareness campaign and facilitating the groundwater quality and quantity measurement foster et al 2004 a groundwater user association was established at jordan to improve the irrigation technology reducing the expansion of irrigation process minimising the unsustainable groundwater consumption wijnen et al 2012 in yamen water user association wua is formed to lead the change of crop cultivation process to prevalent the less water consumption varieties among drought prone areas etc similarly in india community based groundwater management was introduced to promote and develop resource efficient irrigation technology to bring changes to the cropping pattern and to disseminate the achievements of drought resistant crop in china wua was formed to make aware farmers about cost and modern irrigation techniques to minimize the groundwater usage foster et al 2004 all the introduced policies or acts of bangladesh are inadequate to put emphasis on formation of groundwater user group or association to promote sustainable agriculture practices and to reduce the amount and pattern of groundwater consumption 6 9 tariff water crisis becomes enormous in many countries of the world water tariff is considered as imperative to conserve ground water and achieve water efficiency this was introduced by several developing and developed countries in recent days farmers enjoy subsidised water fees all over the world but industries and city dwellers are asked to pay the water fees last of couple of decades european union eu witnessed severe water scarcity and drought hence eu has declared water is a crucial natural resource in 2000 eu has embraced water framework directive wfd to emphasis on economic analysis of water uses and paying the full cost of received water services by its users several tools and methods were developed and shared with participatory countries to analysis the demand and price of water additionally this directive has advised to take measures for different environmental goals e g abstraction control pollution prevention techniques etc to ensure sustainable use of groundwater quevauviller 2005 tortella et al 2017 water tariff is practiced globally in iran where the law is based upon islamic law or sharia introduced fees for agriculture domestic and industrial usage iran adopted the first law in 1982 where ministry of agriculture authorized to distribute water to farmers for agriculture and collect fees water and wastewater companies are responsible for water distribution to city dwellers and collect the associated fees alasti 2013 an amendment was carried out in 1990 to assess the operational and maintenance cost in fee as a result of this amendment water price was increased to 25 30 for domestic usage and higher tariff set for industrial and commercial usages in 1996 faruqui et al 2001 like other middle east countries israel has adopted several policies to minimize the groundwater consumption and to increase water efficiency in 1959 israel introduced country s first water law which emphasized on administrative control over all water resources including groundwater afterward series of policies were introduced to minimize the groundwater consumption by reusing water and increasing the water tariff those steps make israel to become world leader in wastewater reuse katz 2016 brazilian water act recognizes the economic value of water and introduces fees for water users government of bangladesh 1997 brazil has introduced water fees for water users however the collected fees are still low and have little practical value government of brazil 1997 agricultural sector has opposed the charge for water use and argued to introduce separate fees for small to large farmers brazil has found significant behaviour changes were observed among water users victor et al 2014 government of bangladesh recognised that economic value and other incentives are crucial measures for water management specially groundwater conservation article 4 14 of national water policy emphasized on development of pricing structure for ground water and identification of appropriate financial incentive for groundwater for preventing over exploitation and pollution ministry of water resource 1999 bangladesh has experienced several challenges to establish adequate monitoring of quality and quantity of water resources because of lack of availability of modern technology water tariff was introduced only on dhaka city and billed together with sanitation tariff water tariff is highly subsidised to make water affordable to poor however the current price influences unsustainable consumption anwar 2010 undoubtedly water pricing is an important factor improving water efficiency minimising the recover cost enhancing the social equity and ensuring financial stability of operators or providers 7 conclusion modern water legislations reserve government ownership instead of individuals are based on empirical assessment and public private participation for equitable distribution of water to meet human rights and to support economic development it offers a striking balance between demand and supply to avoid water conflicts among different water users in recent years bangladesh has considered water resource as a viral asset introduced several policies and plans for effective water governance the present study has evaluated the country s existing legal frameworks and identified a number of policies which are out of date due to lack of integration in climate change issue currently there is no adequate policy to ensure effective coordination of all ministries for water resource management coordination in governance can be improved by forming a user group through an appropriate mix of all relevant governmental ministries major water users and civil society maintaining a balance between demand and supply to support a country s expanding economic growth is one of the key emerging challenges for bangladesh the existing legal framework recognizes this issue but unable to provide specific guidelines to address the key challenges because of absence of modern technology it is well acknowledged that specific action plan on issuing licenses setting up prices for water usage establishing effective monitoring and reporting system regulating groundwater abstraction incentivizing reuse of water and empowering local governmental authorities are yet to be incorporated in water policies 
12270,legal framework is very crucial to protect the vital resources to provide rights to public and administration to support national policy and to bring technological intervention to ensure equitable distribution fair management and effective decision making in bangladesh groundwater is not directly priced other than pumping costs perhaps such issue is not surprising that users do not meter the volumes of water usage beside the industry agricultural sector is by far the biggest groundwater consumer of this country contributing significant amount of annual meter drop in the groundwater table to the annual decline of groundwater table additionally the groundwater resources are severely affected by pollution encroachment and overexploitation national water policy 1999 and bangladesh water act 2013 are considered as country s pivotal legal framework but both of these lag behind to provide effective guidelines on permission extraction limit monitoring protection of quality water harvesting procedure and recharge mechanism existing institutions suffer from consistent crisis politics corruption absence of public participation and coordination of other institutions mismanagement and empirical assessment this study evaluates the existing water related policies and functions of multidimensional institutions and discusses the key challenges of effective groundwater management the present paper also provides an overview of established practices around the world to cope with the common challenges graphical abstract fx1 keywords water law groundwater law pollution control abstraction control governance water management institutions 1 introduction groundwater is considered as one of the most valuable water resources for its quality and quantity around the world agriculture industry and domestic usages are highly reliant on groundwater for its availability quality and low cost for abstraction increasing population growth rapid and unplanned urbanization and industrialization flourishing economic development food security and impact of climate change are putting unprecedented pressure on groundwater consumption uncsd 2012 efforts to address the key challenges are common in developing countries but it is also remain superficial in developing countries lack of attention no strict legislation and ineffective institution to manage groundwater are common in developing and underdeveloped countries mechlem 2016 it is well acknowledged that effective governance is the prerequisite for a sound water resource management governance which is of both legal framework and functions of governmental institutions provide a clear direction for the usage and allocation of resources through a transparent and accountable processes green et al 2015 reichert et al 2015 groundwater governance exists different ways in across the world many countries of asia africa and south america adopt informal or customary laws to protect and manage their groundwater developed countries put enormous efforts to address the key challenges for inclusive integrated and equitable distribution of water resources modern water law of developed countries considers comprehensive approaches with clear definitions standards management tools protection measures and research based finding for effective management in recent years bangladesh has achieved remarkable economic growth this achievement is primarily attributed to industrial revolution and significant increase of agriculture productivity dorosh 2006 consequently country s water resources are tremendously affected by traditional agricultural practices through excessive water withdrawal poor sanitation system pollution and impact of climate change freshwater scarcity not only manifests in the form of downturn of groundwater tables reduced river flows shrinking lakes and heavily polluted waters but also increases costs of supply and treatment intermittent supplies and conflicts on water in 1992 bangladesh government adopted water resource planning act water resources planning organization warpo a multidisciplinary organization came into an existence in 1992 through water resource planning act to manage country s water resource planning until 1996 warpo was mainly involved with flood control and development of nationwide flood protection action plan flood plan coordination organization fpco and warpo were merged on 1996 to formulate national scale water policy eventually country s first water related policy national water policy was published on 1999 afterwards a number of plans were implemented to support this policy in 2013 government introduced bangladesh water act to ensure effective water governance including groundwater bangladesh water development board bwdb is responsible for managing country s overall water resource with the cooperation of other governmental ministries this review article aimed to identify the key priorities for groundwater governance in bangladesh and to providing insights of relevant legislations for fostering integrated water resource management bangladesh water act national water policy and environmental act are considered as key legislations for country s water resource management this present article will discuss the insights of these legislations on groundwater protection also this study will provide an overview of existing practices of groundwater governance in different parts of the world special laws with the development of modern environment friendly techniques may reduce the impacts of these modern activities thus relevant regulations are necessary to protect the quality and quantity of groundwater to ensuring sustainable conservation are beyond the scope of this paper 2 physical context and climate bangladesh is a riverine country because of a network of 230 tributaries and distributaries is considered as one of the largest deltas of the world named as bengal delta qureshi et al 2015 this delta is largely formed by alluvium and deltaic sediment deposition of ganges brahmaputra and meghna rivers mukherjee and bhattacharya 2001 majumder et al 2013 in general four major physiographic units exist in bengal delta which are a tertiary sediments in the hilly areas b pleistocene terraces in the madhupur and barind tracts c holocene floodplains of the ganges brahmaputra and meghna rivers d the delta covering the rest of the country fig 1 ahmed et al 2004 zahid and ahmed 2006 unconsolidated pleistocene and holocene sediments are considered as the most productive aquifer 82 aquifer are covered by holocene sediments kinniburgh and smedley 2001 zahid and ahmed 2006 majumder et al 2013 in 1982 bwdb and united nation development program undp identified and named three major aquifers of bengal delta fig 2 zahid and ahmed 2006 these three major aquifers composite or shallow main or intermediate and deep are considered as the main source of groundwater in this country below surface shallow aquifer are mostly composed by silt and clay the depth of this aquifer is ranged between few meters in north to 60 m in south matin 1989 farmers ordinarily abstract water for irrigation from these aquifers intermediate or main aquifer places between shallow and deep aquifer comprises medium and coarse grained sand sediments in places with inter bedded with gravel the depth of this aquifer is ranged from 5 m in the north to 140 m in the south large industries install deep tubewell dtw to abstract water from this water bearing zone deep aquifer situated beneath the intermediate or main aquifer it is comprised of medium to coarse sand in places and inter bedded with fine silt and clay depth of this zone is ranged from 190 m to 1500 m zahid and ahmed 2006 deep aquifer contains high level of iron manganese and chloride an aquitard of clay deposit is positioned beneath the main aquifer groundwater level is generally high in north but it is usually low in southern part and sylthet depression area mpo 1987 transboundary rivers of india and myanmar carry huge amount of water and sediments fig 3 about 95 water originates outside of the country therefore the availability of the water is equally proportionate to each year ahmed et al 2001 estimated total renewable water resources are 1226 600 mm3 year 1 including 84 000 mm3 year 1 of surface water 21 000 mm3 year 1 of groundwater and 1121 600 mm3 year 1 of cross boundary river water flows fao 2011a 2011b rajmohan and prathapar 2013 during monsoon season june to september country witnesses about 80 of rainfall have been occurred in post monsoon and pre monsoon seasons bangladesh has 1200 mm average annual rainfall throughout the year chowdhury 2010 in recent years the mean rainfall decreases sharply in post monsoon season and significant changes are noted in daily basis occurrence of rainfall rana et al 2007 groundwater recharge mostly depends on seepage of rainfall and only small portion 0 04 of total recharge is done though river water mpo 1987 it was estimated that 11 of the total rainfall recharges the groundwater and the rest are lost due to evaporation and drainage to the nearest water bodies jahan et al 2010 the average infiltration rate is 1 2 mm day to 7 5 mm day in different parts of bangladesh sir macdonald and partners 1983 depending upon rainfall exploitation and seasonal variation the yearly groundwater level fluctuates in 4 23 6 26 mm each year ahmed 1996 usually groundwater recharge starts on late october and ends on mid of december as bangladesh has the shortest monsoon period and soil with poor water holding capacity 3 declination of groundwater table and water quality in bangladesh country s agrarian based structure dominates the overall economy and the structure contributes 18 6 of total gdp bangladesh bureau of statistics 2012 irrigation is considered as a pivotal precondition to enhance the agriculture production local farmers mostly practice small scale irrigation procedure prior to 1970s country s agriculture was highly reliant on surface water to produce rice undp 1982 boro rice is considered as a high yielding rice which grows during dry season december april and requires 0 4 1 5 m of irrigation ravenscroft et al 2009 government ngos and private sectors installed millions of drinking tubewell hand tubewell htw and shallow irrigation tubewell stw under clean drinking water decade and watsan programme these programs were aimed of increasing productivity of boro rice and shifting the source of drinking water warpo 2000 bgs bgs british geological survey and dphe department of public health and engineering 2001 world bank 2005a 2005b 2005c ministry of environment and forest 2012 these tubewells significantly improved irrigation practices and assisted to lessen waterborne diseases because people of bangladesh used to drink untreated surface water prior 1990s which was the main reason of high mortality rate among children due to different types of waterborne diseases e g diarrhoea cholera etc nowadays about 85 of total denizens of dhaka city and around 80 of country s total population use groundwater for drinking purpose moreover estimated 80 of total irrigation is done by groundwater general economic division 2015 groundwater consumption comparatively higher in north western and south western parts of the country and lowest in north eastern and south eastern districts fig 4 badc 2008 low manpower costs availability of water resources and supportive governmental legislations facilitate industrial growth in bangladesh textile tannery and steel are the main water consuming industries and they are highly reliant upon groundwater to produce products estimated 9500 000 m3 of groundwater is used annually by country s industrial sectors and the usage of groundwater has been increasing each year general economic division 2015 in addition to water quantity the effect of the industry on water quality remains a significant concern the textile industry uses around 2000 different chemicals as inputs auxiliaries in processing however most of the textile factories have improper or inefficient wastewater treatment facility as a result a significant amount of chemicals and salts are discharged into surface water and caused severe water and soil pollution world bank 2005a 2005b 2005c consequently surface water of industrial area becomes unusable for domestic agriculture and industrial activities by 2011 large portion of abstracted groundwater 88 are being used for irrigation or agricultural purpose hence agriculture sector is considered as the highest groundwater consumer in bangladesh fig 5 to support country s growing boro rice production the government and ngos have installed huge number of stw and deep tubewells dtw across the country the stw based irrigation area has increased into 3044 000 ha from 57 000 ha and dtw supplied area has also increased to 702 000 ha from 138 000 ha in 2007 in comparison with 1975 fig 6 groundwater fed irrigation is was found most common in northern parts and less common in the southern parts of the country fig 4 several studies have been conducted to assess potential shallow aquifer recharge status in bangladesh one of the important studies was conducted by international bank of reconstruction and development ibrd through separating effective rainfall and potential evaporation shamsudduha et al 2011 later undp carried out a comprehensive study where potential recharge was defined as a difference between surface runoff and potential evaporation fig 7a undp 1982 in 1987 and 1991 mpo estimated nationwide shallow aquifer recharge using finite difference recharge method fig 7b mpo 1987 1991 in this method physical hydrological and agricultural parameters were highly considered with other variables shamsudduha et al 2011 all of these studies fall short to properly measure the actual shallow aquifer recharge status in different parts of bangladesh for instance karim 1984 drilled several boreholes in north eastern districts and noticed that the actual recharge was lower than potential recharge karim 1984 besides in recent study in north eastern part of the country estimated the potential recharge found higher than actual recharge ravenscroft 2003 groundwater modeling studies by von brömssen et al 2014 in the matlab upazila indicated that the groundwater hydrology is characterized by a number of local flow systems in the shallow aquifers governed by local topographic variations as well as the pattern of rainfall in the region during the monsoon season however such detailed studies are needed to understand the hydrological flow systems at both local as well as regional scales 4 groundwater governance in different countries in many countries of the world water is considered as public wealth in islamic law groundwater is considered as public wealth but the ownership of a certain portion of water in well entails to its owners and rest is declared as forbidden considering this basic trait most of the muslim countries consider water as a community of interest caponera 2007 according to islamic law saudi arabia adopts similar kind of regulations to manage their water resources in 2001 ministry of water of saudi arabia became responsible for managing all types of water resources of this gulf country besides regulating the private ownership by imposing permits for drilling of wells and for imposing bans on drilling water stresses or over pumped areas fao 2009 like islamic law customary regimes considered groundwater as a community belonging and rejected the idea of private ownership bhutan namibia argentina mozambique paraguay tanzania and zambia acknowledge the customary water rights and grant water allocation for land tenure mozambique s water licensing regulation 2007 law on water resource paraguay 2007 argentina s water law of tucuman province 2001 water resource management act tanzania 2009 and namibia s water management act 2013 regard the customary water rights and regulate the unauthorized water withdrawal by introducing borehole license or permit burchi 2005 2011 in such laws governing authorities are empowered to monitor the water usages to limit water abstraction protecting the quality of groundwater in some cases governing authority declared that the quantity of water can be withdrawn annually from an aquifer edwards aquifer authority act 1993a 1993b ibraimo 1999 promulgation of water resource management act 2013 considering the sustainability of aquifer stirred by islamic and customary law many countries of the world impose different rules and regulations kenya kyrgyzstan the northern territory of australia oman philippines and costa rica enact permit for registration of borehole digging or drilling to protect groundwater from pollution and overexploitation additionally all of these countries introduce rules and guideline for construction maintenance and sealing of abandoned wells to manage the groundwater mechlem 2016 here government are the owner of all water resources including groundwater in 2016 british columbia province of canada enforces new water sustainability act where a user needs a license and thus pays necessary fees to abstract groundwater for nondomestic usage water sustainability act 2016 water metering is introduced to regulate the water usage and the users are advised to submit the water withdrawn data regularly to local authority harris 2003 in south asia and northern part of china small scale farmers are allowed to abstract water without having permission to irrigate small plots of 2 ha or less shah et al 2003 also bhutan has introduced bhutan water act 2011 to regulate the unsustainable water usage by imposing fees to abstract groundwater bhutan water act 2011 other parts of the world considered groundwater as a private ownership and allowed land owners to extract groundwater without any cost however people of different areas of pakistan india and bangladesh consider groundwater as private ownership due to lack of knowledge on water related acts and absence of strict enforcement or implementation of water laws as a consequence these countries experience indiscriminate use of groundwater garduno et al 2011 steenbergen et al 2015 5 water governance in bangladesh bangladesh has introduced several policies for water governance and sustainable usage of water arsenic contamination in groundwater is alarming in bangladesh hence arsenic mitigation policy and plan is introduced to facilitate the use of surface water instead of groundwater for drinking water this plan adheres the water quality standard as defined in other national standard government of bangladesh 2010 bangladesh water act 2013 is the newest water policy of this country absorbed under the national water policy 1999 the water act surpassed all the other direct water acts and created connection with relevant policies e g disaster management act 2012 coastal development strategy 2006 the coastal zone policy 2005 national policy for safe water supply sanitation 1998 government of bangladesh 1995 national forest policy 1994 groundwater management ordinance 1985 and the forest act 1927 wwf 2015 table 1 showed different water management laws in bangladesh in bangladesh water related policies are indiscriminate and not comprehensive in nature pal et al 2011 among all introduced policies environmental conservation act 1995 and bangladesh water act 2013 are considered as the key legal frameworks for water governance chan et al 2016 environmental conservation act 1995 provides detailed guideline for water management through formulation of standards and protective measures for surface water however this act fails to incorporate groundwater management government of bangladesh 1995 national water policy 1999 emphasises safe and clean groundwater for domestic agriculture and industrial usages bangladesh water act 2013 describes the roles and responsibilities of different stakeholders and highlights this inter ministerial cooperation for effective management there is no detailed guideline on monitoring and reporting ensuring private and public participation for decision making and infrastructure development for protecting groundwater and authorizing local governmental authority for community based management ministry of law justice and parliamentary affair 2013 table 2 described groundwater policy integration of major national water policies in bangladesh for water governance 6 key challenges for existing groundwater governance practices in bangladesh bangladesh is considered as one of the most disaster prone countries of the world each year many cyclones and flood hit the country these natural phenomena contaminate the surface water and threatening the public health in consequence citizens become reliant on groundwater to meet the needs of drinking water asaduzzaman et al 2010 besides safe drinking water remains a critical challenge for bangladesh as a consequence of arsenic contamination saha et al 2018 surface water pollution and salinity intrusion of coastal area it is well acknowledged from recent studies that arsenic is well enriched in upper aquifer of coastal plains moderately present in depressed land delta and flood plains and low in piedmont pleistocene uplands and tertiary hills mukherjee and bhattacharya 2001 von brömssen et al 2014 arsenic is mostly distributed at depth between 20 and 50 m and is less abundant at deeper than 150 m ahmed et al 2004 furthermore recent empirical studies on groundwater abstraction reveal that over use of groundwater pose arsenic contamination ministry of environment and forest 2012 dey et al 2017 naturally occurrence arsenic in groundwater significantly reduce the access of safe drinking water in different parts of the country hossain 2015 hossain et al 2015 2017 numerous literature reports have highlighted that the extensive presence of arsenic in groundwater in bangladesh 41 50 districts of 64 districts of bangladesh have arsenic concentration over 50 μg l ahmed et al 2004 hasan et al 2007 mukherjee and bhattacharya 2001 mukherjee et al 2008 von brömssen et al 2008 annaduzzaman et al 2018 yunus et al 2016 on top of natural phenomena current government policy accelerates the industrial growth by allowing indiscriminate groundwater use without permission and cost poses serious threat to sustainable groundwater consumption moreover water consumption scenario is often exacerbated by the lack of awareness in efficient manufacturing techniques and technologies therefore industries are highly depended on groundwater rather than reusing and minimising blue water consumption world bank 2005a 2005b 2005c like industrial sector agriculture plays an indispensable role on country s economy and food security government of bangladesh provides financial incentives for improving agricultural productivity the lower rate of electricity is considered as financial incentive for farmers and as a matter of fact it is no longer surprising that the irrigation hours in rural areas are so high this watering system is highly reliant upon groundwater abstraction mandal 2006 in recent years bangladesh s economy has been growing consistently on an average above of the blistering rate of more than 6 and such growth exacerbates the groundwater demand significantly significant numbers of policies are introduced for water allocation and demarcation but bureaucratic system delays the whole process it is said by different researches that country s most of the water policies were formulated without empirical assessment and introduced with inadequate training for local authorities hence country s policies fail to address the key challenges mandal 2006 roy and chan 2014 however industries are often accused of misusing groundwater excessively and polluting surrounding environment it is acknowledged that water resources are inseparably linked with global climate dynamics uncertainties accompany with climate change are likely to increase water demand additional effects of climate change that have important implications include the changes of monsoon pattern unpredictable rainfall distribution fall in water quality and an increase in temperature these create critical problems for water resource management world water assessment programme 2012 6 1 permission for groundwater abstraction in 1985 groundwater management ordinance was introduced in bangladesh to manage the groundwater this ordinance empowered the local government to permit renew or to cancel license of stw and dtw usage for irrigation however several key issues for instance detail engineering design protection from pollution monitoring of water withdrawal information conservation of groundwater in water stress areas and recharges were not included in this ordinance government of bangladesh gob suspended this ordinance to increase the agricultural production in 1992 and after that the local government authority lost the authorization to protect groundwater badc 2005 during 1990s to 2000s unplanned installation of stw and dtw rose significantly contributed to the rapid fall of groundwater level in different parts of bangladesh and threatened the sustainable agriculture development many countries around the world e g australia chile kenya oman namibia usa etc have introduced strict legislations to control groundwater usage to restrict the right to access groundwater information to allow permission for digging and to protect groundwater from pollution to control groundwater abstraction both chile and british columbia province of canada introduced taxes for industry and large scale farmers mechlem 2016 developing countries have introduced abstraction charge for withdrawing groundwater this charge can be adjustable for farmers but it has significant impact on controlling over extraction berbel et al 2007 in texas of usa edwards aquifer authority act precludes the withdrawal of more than 572 000 acre feet annually from entire aquifer edwards aquifer authority act 1993a 1993b besides jordan embraces comprehensive groundwater basin management plan where all wells are subject to be registered and monitored abstraction quota resource charges have also been introduced to limit the groundwater usage in jordan wijnen et al 2012 according to article no 4 3 of national water policy 1999 government reserves the ownership right of water resources including groundwater however this policy did not provide guidelines on granting permission for digging or bore holing for groundwater withdrawn bangladesh water act 2013 did not provide clear guideline of granting permission to protect the groundwater it is well proven from other country s policy that issuing license for borehole digging not only regulates unsustainable abstraction but also protects the quantity of this unseen resource moreover preliminary price or tax for groundwater use is an effective solution to minimize the overexploitation and monitor its usage according to recent water act government can cancel the permission of water withdrawn a certain area if safe yield level crosses the lowest level 6 2 inadequate measures for agriculture land surface zoning and changing agricultural pattern are often considered as important tools to recharge groundwater naturally land surface zoning makes industry and agriculture to limit water abstraction into certain level and ensures regular monitoring of water consumption it is known that cropping pattern and irrigation method play an important role to minimize groundwater usage it is evident that some native vegetation has the capacity to increase the recharge rate into one to two magnitudes taylor et al 2003 gob introduced national water policy and bangladesh water act with a view to regulate the unsustainable groundwater consumption through exercising water allocation based on specified priorities and water scarcity these legislations allow government to confer any private ownership on groundwater abstraction in drought prone or water stressed areas for adequate groundwater recharge for instance punjab and haryana states of india prohibited to sow paddy water before certain dates of may and june to avoid evaporation the punjab preservation of sub soil water act 2009 the haryana preservation of sub soil water act 2009 jordan introduced water strategy 2008 2022 to meet the water demands and equitable distribution of its underground water resources to the top prioritized areas for instance municipal industrial education and tourism areas for agricultural sectors prioritization of groundwater usage is given to those farmers who made high investment on water efficient irrigation system wijnen et al 2012 the productivity of the agriculture practices of bangladesh is mostly dependent on geographic location and monsoon transboundary rivers are interconnected with all the large rivers of this country and these rivers also bring huge amount of surface water and sediments from himalaya mountain bangladesh has several disputes with neighbouring countries on river water distribution therefore different parts of the country have already witnessed severe groundwater consumption rate especially during dry season like other countries bangladesh can weight on empirical assessment of early harvesting before embracing this technique extensively to evade pressure on groundwater consumption however none of introduced policies emphasized on sustainable agriculture practice and resource efficient technology for industry to minimize groundwater consumption strong crop diversification effective regulatory system for ago chemical use and appropriate monitoring procedure for groundwater use recharge and quality management are mentioned in article 4 7 of national water policy 1999 ministry of water resource 1999 6 3 groundwater quality protection and recharge over use of groundwater uncontrolled pesticide and fertilizer use disposal of untreated wastewater salinity intrusion inadequate or lack of guideline for artificial recharge are the common challenges for groundwater protection gob introduces many environmental legislations to protect this water resource effectively and efficiently bangladesh environmental conservation act 1995 national water policy 1999 and water act 2013 are considered as the key legislations for managing country s water resources by these legislations government authority is empowered to declare water stress zone to restrict the unsustainable abstraction to monitor the effluent treatment facility of industries to measure the quality of discharged effluent and to impose penalties for violating the environmental compliance article 4 6 of national water policy 1999 emphasises on recharge of aquifers and rainwater harvesting in urban areas however there is no specific action plans recharge methods and the name of the designated organization to manage groundwater in this act moreover all these key legislations fall short to provide guidelines on appropriate protecting measures for aquifer from salinity intrusion table 3 many countries consider groundwater as a finite important water resource therefore impose strict regulations for quality and quantity management for instance policy and strategy for groundwater quality management was adopted by south africa to protect its groundwater from adverse effect on mining industry domestic and agricultural activities this policy is an attempt to regulate the point pollution source and to foster the development of low waste and no waste technology republic of south africa 2000 additionally south africa enacted artificial recharge strategy during 2007 to improve the groundwater level where water tables have dropped significantly due to overuse this strategy comprises of seven themes including creating awareness optimizing management developing capacity for institutions cost effective artificial recharge method technological intervention and implementation accompanied by rejuvenating the recharging strategy republic of south africa 2007 similarly andhra pradesh of india adopted land water and trees act and rules in 2002 for rainwater harvesting in residential commercial and open area having no less than 200 m2 6 4 monitoring monitoring system is an indiscriminate part of effective groundwater governance and considered as a key component for water legislations to regulate the unsustainable consumption to improve the quality and quantity and to formulate appropriate plans for equitable distribution monitoring system plays a crucial role for relevant institutions as it provides guidelines to monitor interpret and store data for forecasting planning and proper management mechlem 2016 there is a direct association between intervention of scientific methods and modern technology with monitoring of groundwater table application of scientific tools instruments and software helps in estimating the present status of groundwater table abstraction behaviour recharging mechanism and pollution status once baseline data is available it facilitates the scientific based management and design programs to secure water rights and improve quality and quantity of water table moreover it helps to give permission or approval of water withdrawal from borehole limits the withdrawal amount and protects from pollution however monitoring is a technically demanding and costly exercise article 4 7 of national water policy 1999 emphasized on strengthening monitoring system of organizations to address groundwater recharge procedures current consumption status and quality of groundwater ministry of water resources 1999 country s only water act bangladesh water act 2013 emphasized on groundwater conservation but yet to provide adequate guideline 6 5 planning water legislations require up to date resource management plan for fair water management water management plan contains brief description of a country s aquifer and other hydrological resources surface and groundwater linkage consumption behaviour and significance of aquifer in many cases water management plants are introduced without giving due consideration of reliable information of water source and adequacy available for usage thus water crisis and mismanagement becomes grave issue in many parts of the world it is important to recognize the increasing demand and long term needs of dwellers water legislations of many developed countries e g morocco texas south australia south africa etc emphasized on water resource management plans and provide necessary guidelines for relevant governmental institutes van koppen 2007 edwards aquifer authority act 1993a 1993b provides specific guidelines on groundwater management plan formulation to edwards aquifer authority edwards aquifer authority act 1993a 1993b in andhra pradesh water land and tree act 2002 that provides guidelines to form an authority consisting of government officials professors and experts for water resource management planning authority is responsible for formulating guidelines to relevant governmental authorities on rain water harvesting and reuse government of andhra pradesh 2002 like other countries bangladesh emphasises heavily on water resource management plan to promote effective and fair management according to article 15 of bangladesh water act 2013 warpo has been authorized to draft national water resource plan nwrp for executive committee ministry of law justice and parliamentary 2013 warpo is responsible for incorporating several key issues including description of the water resource analysis of the social economic impacts on water resources scientific analysis of data development of infrastructure for water abstraction present condition of water use forecasting of future use surface and groundwater linkage present quantity and quality of water bangladesh water act provides guidelines on formation of executive committee discussion topic review alteration and approval bangladesh water act 2013 adequately addresses all the key steps for effective formulation of water resource management plan for maintaining balance between water demand and supply 6 6 managing other challenges environmental impact assessment is one of the prerequisites for new industrial establishment in bangladesh this principle is an attempt to address the adverse effect on any establishment in ecosystem water air and soil and to emphasize an appropriate environmental management system to minimize the environmental footprint existing establishments such as industries hospitals hotels etc are prescribed to produce their environmental impact assessment report for renewing licenses or permits government of bangladesh 1995 like bangladesh mexico jordan kenya paraguay and other countries include these key issues in water related regulations and make environmental impact assessment as an indispensable requirement for obtaining permit or license unep 2010 climate change is one of the major long term constraints for the economy and human civilization bangladesh experiences several adverse effects of climate change i e unpredictable flash flood occurrence in north eastern parts salinity intrusion in southern areas and changes in monsoon time in recent years in this regard gob adopted national adaption programme of action 2005 to incorporate the potential response measures to reduce the effect of climate change ministry of environment and forest 2005a 2005b this action plan fails to draw specific guidelines and responsibilities for government authorities to protect groundwater from salinity intrusion in 2009 bangladesh climate change strategy and action plan bccsap was introduced to develop programs for six pillars food security comprehensive disaster management infrastructure research and knowledge management mitigation and capacity building to reduce the climate change vulnerability bccsap specified that government funds and other external financial supports will facilitate the implementation procedures it details the financial technical and human resource supports for managing different programs hence bccsap is considered as country s one of the most comprehensive action plans for climate change adoption this plan highlights the development of climate resilient cropping system and minimization of groundwater abstraction ministry of environment and forest 2009 however it does not provide specific action plan on infrastructure development to recharge groundwater table chan et al 2016 like bangladesh bhutan uruguay south africa etc also have been recognizing the threat of climate change on water resource management and putting enormous efforts on development climate change adaption techniques for water resource management in many developed countries climate change has been considered as an indispensable part of water governance and included in the major water related legislations to abate its threat on water resource national action plans for climate change and water resource management are not interlinked in many countries of the world including bangladesh bangladesh is still lagging behind to incorporate climate change adaptation strategies into water acts mechlem 2016 6 7 politics bangladesh is one of the democratic countries of south asia undue influence of governing body and lack of technical supports and have made some weaker policies for groundwater management world bank 2005a 2005b 2005c bureaucratic complicacy is responsible for corruption and affects the overall policy development and administrative functions pahl wostl 2007 public may find difficulty to get access to water resource information which eventually blocks the participation of water users in policy development or reformation procedure world bank 2005a 2005b 2005c sometimes district wide water demand and supply are not properly assessed due to shortage of modern technology moreover lack of public participation comprehensive regulations and inadequate involvement of local authorities weaken the overall water resource management practices gupta 2011 dewan et al 2015 these shortfalls are susceptive to levitate water conflict and to weaken the functions of water institute in future 6 8 institutional support in bangladesh water resources planning organisation warpo bangladesh water development board bwdb and department of environment doe are predominately responsible for planning and managing country s water resources warpo delineates the hydrological resources and formulates long and short term plan to manage this resource bwdb is responsible for program management and coordination with different governmental organizations for infrastructure i e bridge dam etc development and maintenance additionally bwdb assesses the current and future water demand designs different water development programs administers water rights and provides technical inputs and reviews the national level perspective or development plans other than wpro and bwdb doe has completely different functions and responsibilities the main tasks of doe are to organize stakeholders for managing ecology monitoring water quality and quantity and enforcing the water law warpo often fails to address the key challenges of different areas of the country as a consequence developed programs sometime unable to bring enormous success moreover doe and bwdb are still lagging behind to establish strong coordination with other governmental ministries e g agriculture infrastructure forestry road transports etc therefore most of the programs and policies of water resource management suffer from consistent crisis and mismanagement nanni et al 2006 developing countries put notable efforts to develop an effective institution for workable solutions to these crisis and uncertainties most of the countries of the world have single water resource management institute with similar principles and functions to manage their water resources mechlem 2016 however an inter governmental inter agency mechanism is in a place to coordinate with other relevant ministries to develop plans strategies and implement programs additionally many countries form a committee or council or commission including local tenure and groundwater user groups or associations to identify ineffable challenges and take appropriate measures for instance chile mexico australia and usa enacted the legislation to establish user groups to manage groundwater mechlem 2016 in spain involvement of groundwater user organizations became compulsory by the spanish water law 1985 revised on 2001 for managing overexploited aquifer wijnen et al 2012 cotas or technical ground committees is formed by government of mexico as prescribed by mexican water law 1992 cotas are the civil society groups which are financially supported by public are addressing the challenges of groundwater management implementing the management plan establishing the dialog among different user groups improving the hydrological data providing support to groundwater user community assisting the public awareness campaign and facilitating the groundwater quality and quantity measurement foster et al 2004 a groundwater user association was established at jordan to improve the irrigation technology reducing the expansion of irrigation process minimising the unsustainable groundwater consumption wijnen et al 2012 in yamen water user association wua is formed to lead the change of crop cultivation process to prevalent the less water consumption varieties among drought prone areas etc similarly in india community based groundwater management was introduced to promote and develop resource efficient irrigation technology to bring changes to the cropping pattern and to disseminate the achievements of drought resistant crop in china wua was formed to make aware farmers about cost and modern irrigation techniques to minimize the groundwater usage foster et al 2004 all the introduced policies or acts of bangladesh are inadequate to put emphasis on formation of groundwater user group or association to promote sustainable agriculture practices and to reduce the amount and pattern of groundwater consumption 6 9 tariff water crisis becomes enormous in many countries of the world water tariff is considered as imperative to conserve ground water and achieve water efficiency this was introduced by several developing and developed countries in recent days farmers enjoy subsidised water fees all over the world but industries and city dwellers are asked to pay the water fees last of couple of decades european union eu witnessed severe water scarcity and drought hence eu has declared water is a crucial natural resource in 2000 eu has embraced water framework directive wfd to emphasis on economic analysis of water uses and paying the full cost of received water services by its users several tools and methods were developed and shared with participatory countries to analysis the demand and price of water additionally this directive has advised to take measures for different environmental goals e g abstraction control pollution prevention techniques etc to ensure sustainable use of groundwater quevauviller 2005 tortella et al 2017 water tariff is practiced globally in iran where the law is based upon islamic law or sharia introduced fees for agriculture domestic and industrial usage iran adopted the first law in 1982 where ministry of agriculture authorized to distribute water to farmers for agriculture and collect fees water and wastewater companies are responsible for water distribution to city dwellers and collect the associated fees alasti 2013 an amendment was carried out in 1990 to assess the operational and maintenance cost in fee as a result of this amendment water price was increased to 25 30 for domestic usage and higher tariff set for industrial and commercial usages in 1996 faruqui et al 2001 like other middle east countries israel has adopted several policies to minimize the groundwater consumption and to increase water efficiency in 1959 israel introduced country s first water law which emphasized on administrative control over all water resources including groundwater afterward series of policies were introduced to minimize the groundwater consumption by reusing water and increasing the water tariff those steps make israel to become world leader in wastewater reuse katz 2016 brazilian water act recognizes the economic value of water and introduces fees for water users government of bangladesh 1997 brazil has introduced water fees for water users however the collected fees are still low and have little practical value government of brazil 1997 agricultural sector has opposed the charge for water use and argued to introduce separate fees for small to large farmers brazil has found significant behaviour changes were observed among water users victor et al 2014 government of bangladesh recognised that economic value and other incentives are crucial measures for water management specially groundwater conservation article 4 14 of national water policy emphasized on development of pricing structure for ground water and identification of appropriate financial incentive for groundwater for preventing over exploitation and pollution ministry of water resource 1999 bangladesh has experienced several challenges to establish adequate monitoring of quality and quantity of water resources because of lack of availability of modern technology water tariff was introduced only on dhaka city and billed together with sanitation tariff water tariff is highly subsidised to make water affordable to poor however the current price influences unsustainable consumption anwar 2010 undoubtedly water pricing is an important factor improving water efficiency minimising the recover cost enhancing the social equity and ensuring financial stability of operators or providers 7 conclusion modern water legislations reserve government ownership instead of individuals are based on empirical assessment and public private participation for equitable distribution of water to meet human rights and to support economic development it offers a striking balance between demand and supply to avoid water conflicts among different water users in recent years bangladesh has considered water resource as a viral asset introduced several policies and plans for effective water governance the present study has evaluated the country s existing legal frameworks and identified a number of policies which are out of date due to lack of integration in climate change issue currently there is no adequate policy to ensure effective coordination of all ministries for water resource management coordination in governance can be improved by forming a user group through an appropriate mix of all relevant governmental ministries major water users and civil society maintaining a balance between demand and supply to support a country s expanding economic growth is one of the key emerging challenges for bangladesh the existing legal framework recognizes this issue but unable to provide specific guidelines to address the key challenges because of absence of modern technology it is well acknowledged that specific action plan on issuing licenses setting up prices for water usage establishing effective monitoring and reporting system regulating groundwater abstraction incentivizing reuse of water and empowering local governmental authorities are yet to be incorporated in water policies

for alginate and additionally providing a large matrix for bentonite nanoclay particles duru et al 2001 however there are no description for the use of bapm nanocomposite as adsorbent for pb ii and cd ii in literature in the present study a suspension of alg cys bent is grafted with poly methyl methacrylate pmma to synthesize the bapm nanocomposite the material was further explored for the removal of pb ii and cd ii from aqueous solutions 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials methyl methacrylate mma monomer 99 was purchased from loba chemie india sodium alginate and sodium bentonite potassium persulphate and n n methylene bisacrylamide were procured from sigma aldrich india pb no3 2 and cd no3 2 were purchased from merck india double distilled water was used throughout the experiments 2 2

from centrifuge at 6000 rpm for 1 h and further washed several times with deionized water to remove unreacted amino acid species the functionalized bentonite was dried in vacuum at 60 c for 2 h and grinded 2 3 synthesis of the pmma g alg cys bentonite nanocomposite the nanocomposite material was synthesized by in situ polymerization of mma in a colloidal suspension of alg cys bent the detailed method for synthesis of material is reported elsewhere li et al 2014 2 g of dried sodium alginate powder was taken in 100 ml of double distilled water in a typical round bottom flask and stirred on magnetic stirrer at 40 c for until complete dissolution following the mixing of 0 75 g n n methylene bisacrylamide then 1 0 g of cys bent was taken in 50 ml of double distilled water and sonicated for 1 h at 30 c the suspension of cys bent was mixed to the above solution of alginate at continuous stirring at 40 c for 2 h now 10 ml of mma monomer solution was poured dropwise to the above colloidal solution of alg cys bent followed by addition of 20 ml of 3 kps solution the reaction was left for 12 h with constant stirring at 60 c the product was obtained by pouring the white suspension to the excess amount of methyl alcohol the obtained product was washed several times with methyl alcohol and double distilled water the product was dried at 80 c for 3 h in oven and crushed into fined particles and stored for further characterization and adsorption studies 2 4 characterization of bapm to investigate the type of bond formation and groups involved in adsorption reactions the nanocomposite was characterized by a perkin elmer 1800 model ir spectrophotometer operating at frequency range from 400 to 4000 cm 1 to obtain the information about the crystalline structure of the nanocomposite x ray diffraction xrd technique was used using siemens d 5005 ray unit cu kα λ 1 5406ao radiation generated at a voltage of 40 kv and a current of 40 ma scanning electron microscopy sem analysis were done using gsm 6510lv scanning electron microscope the particle size and distribution of nanoclay in the polymer matrix of the synthesized nanocomposite were observed by using jem 2100 transmission electron microscope tem the thermal stability of the synthesized nanocomposite was determined by thermal analysis tga perkin elmer model sta 6000 the thermograms were recorded at a heating rate of 10 c min 1 in the temperature range of 30 800 c under nitrogen atmosphere the concentration of metal ions in the solution was measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometer aas model gbc 902 elico li 120 ph meter was used to adjust the ph of the solutions 2 5 adsorption of pb ii and cd ii by bapm the adsorption experiments were performed by batch method using 0 05 g of adsorbent for 20 ml of 100 mg l 1 of metal ion concentration using 100 ml conical flask the samples were put into a thermostatic water bath shaker operating at 120 rpm until the equilibrium reached after reaching the equilibrium the samples were filtered off by using filter paper and the concentration of metal ions in the supernatant was analysed by aas the amount of metal ion adsorbed on the surface of the adsorbent was calculated by using following eq 1 1 q e c o c e v w where qe is the amount of metal ion adsorbed per unit weight of the adsorbent mg g 1 co and ce are the concentrations of the metal ion in the initial solution mg l 1 and after adsorption respectively v is the volume of the adsorption medium l w is the amount of the adsorbent in g 2 6 desorption and regeneration experiments the regeneration of bapm was tested up to four cycles by treating the metal ion adsorbed material with 0 1 m hno3 solution and desorption was calculated by using eq 2 2 d e s c d v q e m 100 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of bapm nanocomposite infrared spectroscopy has been proved to be a powerful tool for investigation of chemical structure of the adsorbent synthesized by its individual components the ft ir spectra of bapm and its individual components has been given in fig 1 while looking at the spectra of bentonite the peak at 3640 cm 1 corresponds to oh groups at the inner surface of the bentonite while peak at 1040 cm 1 is due to si o bending vibration and peak at 467 cm 1 corresponds to the si o al bending vibrations parolo et al 2014 in the ftir spectra of cys bent all the peaks are characteristics of bent except the peaks at 1409 cm 1 is a c n stretching band and 1629 cm 1 c o carbonyl bond o h stretching band of bent was broad due to cooh group of l cysteine in addition the peak at 1489 cm 1 represents protonated nh2 that is nh3 bending from these results bent coordinates with the nh2 groups of methionine the ft ir spectra of alginate displays the peak at 3450 cm 1 due to oh stretching the peaks around 1622 and 1160 cm 1 are due to symmetric and asymmetric coo stretching lakouraj et al 2014 the ftir spectra of pmma shows the characteristic peak at 1730 cm 1 c o stretching vibration peak at 2996 and 2950 cm 1 asymmetric and symmetric stretching of ch2 shanthini et al 2015 while the ftir spectra of bapm displays characteristic peaks of pmma with some characteristic peak of bentonite at 483 cm 1 and 1636 cm 1 and in alginate at 3445 cm 1 842 cm 1 which confirms the synthesis of bapm nanocomposite through in situ oxidative polymerization of mma crosslinked with alginate through mba xrd is a versatile and non destructive technique that is used for identification of the crystalline phases present in solid materials the xrd spectra of bapm and its individual components are depicted in fig 2 the diffractogram of bentonite displays a characteristic peak at 26 29 corresponding to d value of 3 01 a which represents a pure crystalline structure shifted to 2θ 25 69 in xrd spectra of cys bent which corresponds to d value of 3 336 å suggesting that l cysteine has been successfully intercalated into the interlayer gallery of bent the xrd pattern of alginate shows amorphous nature the diffractogram of pmma shows a characteristic strong peak at 72 59 representing an amorphous structure with little crystallinity the xrd pattern of bapm represents all the peaks corresponds to both cys bent and pmma showing a predominant crystalline structure with some amorphous nature due grafting with alginate so the incorporation of cys bent to the polymer matrix of pmma provide it more crystalline nature the fractured surface of the hybrid nanocomposite material was observed using sem which can give important information about the morphology of these materials sem images of alginate pmma and bapm before and after adsorption are given in fig 3 in the sem image of pmma a continuous matrix appears with a small fraction of nodules having a spherical shape with various sizes and for alginate irregular spherical granules however in the bapm before adsorption nanocomposite continuous matrix disappears by the incorporation of cys bent and only a nodular structure appears with highly porous in nature this change in surface morphology supported the occurrence of graft polymerization the change in surface morphology of the bapm nanocomposite after adsorption may be due to the penetration of water into the polymer matrix the tga thermograms of pmma g alg matrix and bapm nanocomposite has been shown in fig 4 the tga curve presented that the decomposition of pure pmma takes place in three stages the first stage of pmma decomposition occurs at 130 5 c due to the loss of water and methyl methacrylate from the additive as well as residual acetone the second stage decomposition begins at about 249 69 c which might be due to the radical transfer to unsaturated chain ends the weight loss with third stage about 331 33 c associated with random scission of the polymer backbone kandare et al 2006 the tga thermogram of the bapm nanocomposite also presented two stages of decomposition the thermogram clearly indicated that the first and second stage of decomposition of the composite were shift to higher temperature as compared to pure pmma g alg matrix the residual amount which was contributed by the coal ash in the composite remained at 426 20 c the tga thermograms indicated that the incorporation of bentonite nanoclay enhanced the thermal degradation of bapm high resolution tem image of bapm nanocomposite is given in fig 5 the image clearly indicates a uniform the distribution of bentonite clay in the polymer matrix the average size of nanoclay is about 93 nm surface chemical composition of synthesized material was done by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps and the obtained spectra is given in fig 6 a f from the graph the peaks at 50 74 ev for al 2p 100 05 ev for si 2p and 540 67 ev for o 1s are due to bentonite from the literature it was found that the characteristic peaks of bentonite are found for si 2p al 2p o1s at 103 74 533 ev respectively jlassi et al 2015 so reduction in binding energy is due to copolymerization with pmma and alginate the sharp peak for o 1s at high binding energy indicates that material is rich in oh functional groups the peaks at 290 37 ev for s and 455 71 ev for n 1s are due to cysteine functionalization of bentonite the presence of peak at 152 67 ev for c 1s is due to the carbon chain of pmma and alginate the presence of n 1s peak at high binding energy indicated that n groups are playing an important role in form the linkage between bentonite and pmma g alg matrix which have been already proved by ftir spectra the surface area of bapm were determined by low temperature adsorption of nitrogen the collected isotherm before and after adsorption calculated using the bjh model is given in fig 7 from the literature we found that the surface are of neat pmma polymer and bentonite is 34 71 m2 g and 58 35 m2 g dong et al 2015 kaufhold et al 2010 the obtained results shows that the synthesized material has a surface area of 56 69 m2 g while after adsorption the surface area reduced to 35 43 m2 g the reduction in surface area indicates that maximum pores active sites has been occupied by pb ii 3 2 behaviour of adsorbent towards pb ii and cd ii 3 2 1 effect of ph the effect of solution ph for removal of pb ii and cd ii on bapm nanocomposite was investigated and results are shown in fig 6 a at 45 c as can be seen in the fig 6 a the adsorption capacity for pb ii increases from 23 64 mg g 1 to 37 19 mg g 1 as the ph of the solution increase with an initial metal ion concentration of 100 mg l 1 till ph 5 after that starts decreasing while for cd ii the adsorption capacity increases from 19 25 mg g 1 to 27 39 mg g 1 till ph 4 and then decreases with further increase in solution ph it is well known that bivalent metal ions species mainly found in the form m2 m oh and m oh 2 at ph 9 xu et al 2008 at lower ph 4 0 active sites of the adsorbent are less available for metals ions due to enrichment of h ions in the solution so low adsorption capacity of metal ions at lower ph values mainly attributes to the competition between h and m2 ions for the active site on the adsorbent at moderate ph 4 0 6 0 concentration of h ions on the surface of the adsorbent decreases and more active sites are available for m2 m oh species as a result adsorption capacity increases at ph 6 0 increased removal efficiency of metal ions takes place due to precipitation of metal ions as their hydroxide form m oh 2 takes place 3 2 2 effect of agitation time and initial metal ion concentration the effect of agitation time and initial metal ion concentration for the adsorption of pb ii and cd ii are observed and results are given in fig 6 b c the experiments were conducted in a range of 5 360 min using 100 mg l 1 metal ion solution with 0 05 g of adsorbent at optimum ph and 45 c as can be seen in the fig 6 b the adsorption equilibrium reached at 180 min for pb ii and 240 min for cd ii it is very clear from the fig that as the agitation time increases the adsorption capacity also increase from 26 4 mg g 1 to 37 9 mg g 1 for pb ii and 18 5 mg g 1 to 27 6 mg g 1 for cd ii this may be attributed as at lower agitation time more active sites on the adsorbent are available for adsorption but as the agitation time increase the active sites on the surface of the adsorbent getting occupied by metal ion species after equilibrium attained the surface of the adsorbent got fully saturated and no further increase in metal ion uptake was observed experiments were conducted in a range of 10 100 mg l 1 metal ion concentration to observe the effect of initial metal ion concentration from the fig 6 c it is clearly evident that with the increase in the metal ion concentration metal ion uptake also increases so we have taken 100 mg l 1 as the optimum metal ion concentration in the whole study 3 3 adsorption isotherms generally the adsorption isotherm provides important information about the optimization of the adsorption reactions the equilibrium data was applied to four isotherm model viz langmuir langmuir 1918 freundlich freundlich 1906 sips repo et al 2010 and temkin temkin and pyzhev 1940 and the parameters were calculated by both linear and non linear regression method using origin 8 1 3 3 1 linear fitting of isotherms the linear form of the langmuir freundlich sips and temkin models are given by eqs 3 7 3 c e q e 1 q m k l c e q m 4 ln q e 1 n ln c e ln k f 5 ln q e q m q e 1 n s ln c e 1 n s ln b 6 q e b ln a b ln c e 7 b r t b where ce is the equilibrium concentration mg l 1 qe is the amount of metal ions adsorbed at equilibrium mg g 1 qm is the maximum metal ion uptake capacity mg g 1 kl is the langmuir constant related to the adsorption energy l mg 1 1 n is a numerical value related to the adsorption intensity which varies with the heterogeneity and kf indicates the adsorption capacity a is binding constant l g 1 and the constant b is the heat of adsorption j mol 1 b is a sips constant related to the energy of adsorption l mg 1 and ns is the heterogeneity factor if ns 1 langmuir is applicable and ns 1 then freundlich is applicable for ideal surfaces hence the parameter n could be regarded as the parameter characterizing system heterogeneity the linear fitted isotherms and the calculated parameters along with regression coefficient corresponding to each isotherm are given in fig 7 a d and table 1 on the basis of values of regression coefficient presented in table 1 the langmuir model was found to be best fitted model r2 0 99 followed by temkin r2 0 99 sips r2 0 98 0 99 and then freundlich 0 94 0 97 the maximum monolayer adsorption capacity is 60 24 mg g 1 for pb ii and 47 62 mg g 1 for cd ii the higher value of kl supports for the high affinity of pb ii as compare to cd ii the value of n calculated by freundlich model is greater than unity indicates a favourable adsorption the values of ns obtained for pb ii 1 26 and cd ii 0 97 by sips model are in support for the applicability of the langmuir model the higher value of binding constant a for pb ii 1 54 to cd ii 1 39 by temkin model indicates the higher affinity of pb ii to the adsorbent surface the values of heat of adsorption reveals that adsorption of metal ions takes place through chemisorption so on the basis of the results the equilibrium data follows the adsorption isotherm model in the order langmuir temkin sips freundlich 3 3 2 non linear fitting of isotherm models the non linear equations for the langmuir freundlich sips and temkin models are given by eqs 8 11 8 q e q m k l c e 1 k l c e 9 q e k f c e 1 n 10 q e q m b c e 1 n s 1 b c e 1 n s 11 q e r t b l n a c e the non linear fitted curves of all four isotherms and the parameter values with their regression coefficient values are given in fig s1 a d and table s1 from the table s1 considering the high values of regression coefficient the langmuir model was found to be best fitted with the equilibrium data while the freundlich model was found to be the least fitted model by non linear method the results obtained by non linear regression are in good agreement with the results obtained by linear methods the maximum monolayer adsorption capacity obtained by using langmuir model is 50 68 mg g 1 for pb ii and 47 34 mg g 1 for cd ii 3 4 adsorption kinetics to evaluate the kinetic parameters for the prediction of the adsorption mechanism of pb ii and cd ii at the solid liquid interface of bapm kinetic models such as non linear lagergren pseudo first order model lagergren 1898 pseudo second order ho 2006 elovich model bouabidi et al 2018 and inta particle diffusion weber and morris 1963 were investigated the linear equations of the models are given by eqs 12 and 13 12 q t q e 1 e k 1 t 13 q t k 2 q e 2 t 1 k 2 q e t where qt mg g 1 and qe mg g 1 are the adsorption capacities of heavy metals at time t min and equilibrium state respectively while k1 and k2 are related to the rate constants for pseudo first and second order models fig 11 a b were used for testing the experimental data of adsorption of heavy metals onto bapm at optimum ph and temperature 45 c the values of the kinetic parameters r2 and χ2 calculated by the non linear regression analysis of kinetic models are given in table 2 it is clear that the values of r2 0 90 0 96 are extremely high with the lowest values of χ2 1 76 0 49 for the pseudo second order kinetic model fig 8b followed by pseudo first order kinetic model r2 0 59 0 72 and χ2 7 46 3 15 fig 8a meanwhile the qe cal values 37 40 25 50 mg g 1 obtained from pseudo second order model are found to agree with the qe exp values 37 90 27 60 mg g 1 with negligible deviation the qe cal values 35 94 26 47 mg g 1 estimated from pseudo first order kinetic model are different with least agreement to the experimental values qe exp 37 90 27 60 mg g 1 so the adsorption process for pb ii and cd ii onto bapm can be best described by pseudo second order kinetics and the rate limiting step may be chemisorption 3 5 thermodynamic studies in order to predict the thermodynamic behaviour of the sorption of pb ii and cd ii onto bapm thermodynamic parameters such as gibbs free energy change δg enthalpy change δh and entropy change δs were calculated using the gibbs and the van t hoff equation akkaya and güzel 2013 14 δ g o δ h o t δ s o 15 ln k c δ h o r δ s o r t the calculated parameters and van t hoff plot for thermodynamic studies at 25 35 and 45 c are given in table 3 and fig s2 the positive value of δh 45 33 kj mol 1 for pb ii and 36 99 kj mol 1 cd ii clearly indicates that adsorption process of pb ii and cd ii on bapm is endothermic in nature while the positive value of δs 0 168 kj mol 1 k 1 for pb ii and 0 128 kj mol 1 k 1 cd ii indicates the increased randomness between solid solution interfaces during adsorption process the negative value of δg increases as the temperature increases from 25 c to 55 c suggesting that the adsorption of pb ii and cd ii on bapm is spontaneous at higher temperature 3 6 comparison with other adsorbents a comparison of adsorption capacities of various adsorbent with present work has been listed in table 4 the table reveals that the present adsorbent shows a high adsorption capacity towards pb ii and cd ii the comparison of metal ions adsorption on nanocomposite and its individual components have been presented in fig 9 that clearly indicates that bapm nanocomposite exhibit highest adsorption efficiency towards both metal ions as compared to individual components fig 12 3 7 desorption and regeneration in order to avoid secondary pollution regeneration of synthesized nanocomposite material is very important for this purpose a regeneration study was observed with 0 1 m hcl 0 1 m naoh 0 1 m acetic acid and 0 1 m hno3 and best result was observed with 0 1 m hno3 maximum 92 the adsorption desorption graphs up to four cycles is depicted in fig 10 which indicates that the adsorption efficiency of bapm for pb ii and cd ii decreases continuously from first cycle to fourth cycle the reason for reduction in adsorption efficiency is that after each successive cycle some of the chemically adsorbed adsorbate does not get free by desorbing media the regeneration study for bapm shows that the material can be used up to fourth cycle because after fourth cycle there was significant loss in adsorption efficiency fig 13 3 8 mechanism of adsorption the adsorption mechanisms of heavy metal adsorption onto bapm are not yet fully understood the type of adsorbate adsorbent interaction depends on the chemistry of adsorbate solution ph chemical and physical nature of adsorbent in order to recognize the mechanism of the heavy metal adsorption onto bapm nanocomposite a number of different spectroscopic techniques such as ir edx and xrd were used there may be various adsorption mechanism through which adsorption is taking place such as surface complexation ion exchange and electrostatic interaction for example at lower ph the positively charge nh2 sh and oh groups of bapm have a strong coordinative affinity towards pb ii and cd ii by surface complexation through electrostatic interaction while this affinity decreases at higher ph as due to repulsive force between negatively charged adsorbate and lone pairs of the nh2 and oh groups of bapm the kinetic results in table 2 show that the mechanism is chemical adsorption and may follow the adsorption coupled reduction mechanism in which complex is formed between heavy metals and bapm the positively charged bapm nanocomposite due to the existence of sufficient functional groups such as nh2 sh and oh groups can form a complex with pb ii and cd ii at lower ph values and due to this complex formation the spent material will not cause secondary pollution to the environment 4 conclusion a novel pmma g alg cys bentonite bapm nanocomposite was synthesized and further used as a potential adsorbent for removal of pb ii and cd ii from aqueous solutions the bapm was characterized by using various analytical techniques such as ftir xrd sem tem and tga the optimum ph for the removal of these metal ions was observed at 5 for pb ii and 4 for cd ii respectively the equilibrium for adsorption of heavy metals on bapm was attained in 180 min for pb ii and 240 min for cd ii the equilibrium data was applied for both linear and non linear regression method using origin 8 1 and the data was found to be best fitted by langmuir model having maximum monolayer adsorption capacity of 60 24 mg g 1 for pb ii and 48 78 mg g 1 for cd ii by linear method the data obtained by non linear regression method is in good agreement with the data obtained by linear regression method the equilibrium data was found to follow the isotherm in the order of langmuir temkin sips freundlich model in both linear and non linear methods with a higher r2 and low χ2 value pseudo second order was found to be best described kinetic data suggesting the chemical adsorption to be rate determining step the thermodynamic parameters reveal that the adsorption of pb ii and cd ii on bapm is spontaneous and endothermic in nature the mechanism involved in the removal of heavy metals was electrostatic adsorption coupled reduction which is also evident from edx analysis acknowledgements the authors

magnetic stirrer at 40 c for until complete dissolution following the mixing of 0 75 g n n methylene bisacrylamide then 1 0 g of cys bent was taken in 50 ml of double distilled water and sonicated for 1 h at 30 c the suspension of cys bent was mixed to the above solution of alginate at continuous stirring at 40 c for 2 h now 10 ml of mma monomer solution was poured dropwise to the above colloidal

excess amount of methyl alcohol the obtained product was washed several times with methyl alcohol and double distilled water the product was dried at 80 c for 3 h in oven and crushed into fined particles and stored for further characterization and adsorption studies 2 4 characterization of bapm to investigate the type of bond formation and groups involved in adsorption reactions the nanocomposite was characterized by a perkin elmer 1800 model ir spectrophotometer operating at frequency range from 400 to 4000 cm 1 to obtain the information about the crystalline structure of the nanocomposite x ray diffraction xrd technique was used using siemens d 5005 ray unit cu kα λ 1 5406ao radiation generated at a voltage of 40 kv and a current of 40 ma scanning electron microscopy sem analysis were done using gsm 6510lv scanning electron microscope the particle size and distribution of nanoclay in the polymer matrix of the synthesized nanocomposite were observed by using jem 2100 transmission electron microscope tem the thermal stability of the synthesized nanocomposite was determined by thermal analysis tga perkin elmer model sta 6000 the thermograms were recorded at a heating rate of 10 c min 1 in the temperature range of 30 800 c under nitrogen atmosphere the concentration of metal ions in the solution was measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometer aas model gbc 902 elico li 120 ph meter was used to adjust the ph of the solutions 2 5 adsorption of pb ii and cd ii by bapm the adsorption experiments were performed by batch method using 0 05 g of adsorbent for 20 ml of 100 mg l 1 of metal ion concentration using 100 ml conical flask the samples were put into a thermostatic water bath shaker operating at 120 rpm until the equilibrium reached after reaching the equilibrium the samples were filtered off by using filter paper and the concentration of metal ions in the supernatant was analysed by aas the amount of metal ion adsorbed on the surface

metal ion in the initial solution mg l 1 and after adsorption respectively v is the volume of the adsorption medium l w is the amount of the adsorbent in g 2 6 desorption and regeneration experiments the regeneration of bapm was tested up to four cycles by treating the metal ion adsorbed material with 0 1 m hno3 solution and desorption was calculated by using eq 2 2 d e s c d v q e m 100 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of bapm nanocomposite infrared spectroscopy has been proved to be a powerful tool for investigation of chemical structure of the adsorbent synthesized by its individual components the ft ir spectra of bapm and its individual components has been given in fig 1 while looking at the spectra of bentonite the peak at 3640 cm 1 corresponds to oh groups at the inner surface of the bentonite while peak at 1040 cm 1 is due to si o bending vibration and peak at 467 cm 1 corresponds to the si o al bending vibrations parolo et al 2014 in the ftir spectra of cys bent all the peaks are characteristics of bent except the peaks at 1409 cm 1 is a c n stretching band and 1629 cm 1 c o carbonyl bond o h stretching band of bent was broad due to cooh group of l cysteine in addition the peak at 1489 cm 1 represents protonated nh2 that is nh3 bending from these results bent coordinates with the nh2 groups of methionine the ft ir spectra of alginate displays the peak at 3450 cm 1 due to oh stretching the peaks around 1622 and 1160 cm 1 are due to symmetric and asymmetric coo stretching lakouraj et al 2014 the ftir spectra of pmma shows the characteristic peak at 1730 cm 1 c o stretching vibration peak at 2996 and 2950 cm 1 asymmetric and symmetric stretching of ch2 shanthini et al 2015 while the ftir spectra of bapm displays characteristic peaks of pmma with some characteristic peak of bentonite at 483 cm 1 and 1636 cm 1 and in alginate at 3445 cm 1 842 cm 1 which confirms the synthesis of bapm nanocomposite through in situ oxidative polymerization of mma crosslinked with alginate through mba xrd is a versatile and non destructive technique that is used for identification of the crystalline phases present in solid materials the xrd spectra of bapm and its individual components are depicted in fig 2 the diffractogram of bentonite displays a characteristic peak at 26 29 corresponding to d value of 3 01 a which represents a pure crystalline structure shifted to 2θ 25 69 in xrd spectra of cys bent which corresponds to d value of 3 336 å suggesting that l cysteine has been successfully intercalated into the interlayer gallery of bent the xrd pattern of alginate shows amorphous nature the diffractogram of pmma shows a characteristic strong peak at 72 59 representing an amorphous structure with little crystallinity the xrd pattern of bapm represents all the peaks corresponds to both cys bent and pmma showing a predominant crystalline structure with some amorphous nature due grafting with alginate so the incorporation of cys bent to the polymer matrix of pmma provide it more crystalline nature the fractured surface of the hybrid nanocomposite material was observed using sem which can give important information about the morphology of these materials sem images of alginate pmma and bapm before and after adsorption are given in fig 3 in the sem image of pmma a continuous matrix appears with a small fraction of nodules having a spherical shape with various sizes and for alginate irregular spherical granules however in the bapm before adsorption nanocomposite continuous matrix disappears by the incorporation of cys bent and only a nodular structure appears with highly porous in nature this change in surface morphology supported the occurrence of graft polymerization the change in surface morphology of the bapm nanocomposite after adsorption may be due to the penetration of water into the polymer matrix the tga thermograms of pmma g alg matrix and bapm nanocomposite has been shown in fig 4 the tga curve presented that the decomposition of pure pmma takes place in three stages the first stage of pmma decomposition occurs at 130 5 c due to the loss of water and methyl methacrylate from the additive as well as residual acetone the second stage decomposition begins at about 249 69 c which might be due to the radical transfer to unsaturated chain ends the weight loss with third stage about 331 33 c associated with random scission of the polymer backbone kandare et al 2006 the tga thermogram of the bapm nanocomposite also presented two stages of decomposition the thermogram clearly indicated that the first and second stage of decomposition of the composite were shift to higher temperature as compared to pure pmma g alg matrix the residual amount which was contributed by the coal ash in the composite remained at 426 20 c the tga thermograms indicated that the incorporation of bentonite nanoclay enhanced the thermal degradation of bapm high resolution tem image of bapm nanocomposite is given in fig 5 the image clearly indicates a uniform the distribution of bentonite clay in the polymer matrix the average size of nanoclay is about 93 nm surface chemical composition of synthesized material was done by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps and the obtained spectra is given in fig 6 a f from the graph the peaks at 50 74 ev for al 2p 100 05 ev for si 2p and 540 67 ev for o 1s are due to bentonite from the literature it was found that the characteristic peaks of bentonite are found for si 2p al 2p o1s at 103 74 533 ev respectively jlassi et al 2015 so reduction in binding energy is due to copolymerization with pmma and alginate the sharp peak for o 1s at high binding energy indicates that material is rich in oh functional groups the peaks at 290 37 ev for s and 455 71 ev for n 1s are due to cysteine functionalization of bentonite the presence of peak at 152 67 ev for c 1s is due to the carbon chain of pmma and alginate the presence of n 1s peak at high binding energy indicated that n groups are playing an important role in form the linkage between bentonite and pmma g alg matrix which have been already proved by ftir spectra the surface area of bapm were determined by low temperature adsorption of nitrogen the collected isotherm before and after adsorption calculated using the bjh model is given in fig 7 from the literature we found that the surface are of neat pmma polymer and bentonite is 34 71 m2 g and 58 35 m2 g dong et al 2015 kaufhold et al 2010 the obtained results shows that the synthesized material has a surface area of 56 69 m2 g while after adsorption the surface area reduced to 35 43 m2 g the reduction in surface area indicates that maximum pores active sites has been occupied by pb ii 3 2 behaviour of adsorbent towards pb ii and cd ii 3 2 1 effect of ph the effect of solution ph for removal of pb ii and cd ii on bapm nanocomposite was investigated and results are shown in fig 6 a at 45 c as can be seen in the fig 6 a the adsorption capacity for pb ii increases from 23 64 mg g 1 to 37 19 mg g 1 as the ph of the solution increase with an initial metal ion concentration of 100 mg l 1 till ph 5 after that starts decreasing while for cd ii the adsorption capacity increases from 19 25 mg g 1 to 27 39 mg g 1 till ph 4 and then decreases with further increase in solution ph it is well known that bivalent metal ions species mainly found in the form m2 m oh and m oh 2 at ph 9 xu et al 2008 at lower ph 4 0 active sites of the adsorbent are less available for metals ions due to enrichment of h ions in the solution so low adsorption capacity of metal ions at lower ph values mainly attributes to the competition between h and m2 ions for the active site on the adsorbent at moderate ph 4 0 6 0 concentration of h ions on the surface of the adsorbent decreases and more active sites are available for m2 m oh species as a result adsorption capacity increases at ph 6 0 increased removal efficiency of metal ions takes place due to precipitation of metal ions as their hydroxide form m oh 2 takes place 3 2 2 effect of agitation time and initial metal ion concentration the effect of agitation time and initial metal ion concentration for the adsorption of pb ii and cd ii are observed and results are given in fig 6 b c the experiments were conducted in a range of 5 360 min using 100 mg l 1 metal ion solution with 0 05 g of adsorbent at optimum ph and 45 c as can be seen in the fig 6 b the adsorption equilibrium reached at 180 min for pb ii and 240 min for cd ii it is very clear from the fig that as the agitation time increases the adsorption capacity also increase from 26 4 mg g 1 to 37 9 mg g 1 for pb ii and 18 5 mg g 1 to 27 6 mg g 1 for cd ii this may be attributed as at lower agitation time more active sites on the adsorbent are available for adsorption but as the agitation time increase the active sites on the surface of the adsorbent getting occupied by metal ion species after equilibrium attained the surface of the adsorbent got fully saturated and no further increase in metal ion uptake was observed experiments were conducted in a range of 10 100 mg l 1 metal ion concentration to observe the effect of initial metal ion concentration from the fig 6 c it is clearly evident that with the increase in the metal ion concentration metal ion uptake also increases so we have taken 100 mg l 1 as the optimum metal ion concentration in the whole study 3 3 adsorption isotherms generally the adsorption isotherm provides important information about the optimization of the adsorption reactions the equilibrium data was applied to four isotherm model viz langmuir langmuir 1918 freundlich freundlich 1906 sips repo et al 2010 and temkin temkin and pyzhev 1940 and the parameters were calculated by both linear and non linear regression method using origin 8 1 3 3 1 linear fitting of isotherms the linear form of the langmuir freundlich sips and temkin models are given by eqs 3 7 3 c e q e 1 q m k l c e q m 4 ln q e 1 n ln c e ln k f 5 ln q e q m q e 1 n s ln c e 1 n s ln b 6 q e b ln a b ln c e 7 b r t b where ce is the equilibrium concentration mg l 1 qe is the amount of metal ions adsorbed at equilibrium mg g 1 qm is the maximum metal ion uptake capacity mg g 1 kl is the langmuir constant related to the adsorption energy l mg 1 1 n is a numerical value related to the adsorption intensity which varies with the heterogeneity and kf indicates the adsorption capacity a is binding constant l g 1 and the constant b is the heat of adsorption j mol 1 b is a sips constant related to the energy of adsorption l mg 1 and ns is the heterogeneity factor if ns 1 langmuir is applicable and ns 1 then freundlich is applicable for ideal surfaces hence the parameter n could be regarded as the parameter characterizing system heterogeneity the linear fitted isotherms and the calculated parameters along with regression coefficient corresponding to each isotherm are given in fig 7 a d and table 1 on the basis of values of regression coefficient presented in table 1 the langmuir model was found to be best fitted model r2 0 99 followed by temkin r2 0 99 sips r2 0 98 0 99 and then freundlich 0 94 0 97 the maximum monolayer adsorption capacity is 60 24 mg g 1 for pb ii and 47 62 mg g 1 for cd ii the higher value of kl supports for the high affinity of pb ii as compare to cd ii the value of n calculated by freundlich model is greater than unity indicates a favourable adsorption the values of ns obtained for pb ii 1 26 and cd ii 0 97 by sips model are in support for the applicability of the langmuir model the higher value of binding constant a for pb ii 1 54 to cd ii 1 39 by temkin model indicates the higher affinity of pb ii to the adsorbent surface the values of heat of adsorption reveals that adsorption of metal ions takes place through chemisorption so on the basis of the results the equilibrium data follows the adsorption isotherm model in the order langmuir temkin sips freundlich 3 3 2 non linear fitting of isotherm models the non linear equations for the langmuir freundlich sips and temkin models are given by eqs 8 11 8 q e q m k l c e 1 k l c e 9 q e k f c e 1 n 10 q e q m b c e 1 n s 1 b c e 1 n s 11 q e r t b l n a c e the non linear fitted curves of all four isotherms and the parameter values with their regression coefficient values are given in fig s1 a d and table s1 from the table s1 considering the high values of regression coefficient the langmuir model was found to be best fitted with the equilibrium data while the freundlich model was found to be the least fitted model by non linear method the results obtained by non linear regression are in good agreement with the results obtained by linear methods the maximum monolayer adsorption capacity obtained by using langmuir model is 50 68 mg g 1 for pb ii and 47 34 mg g 1 for cd ii 3 4 adsorption kinetics to evaluate the kinetic parameters for the prediction of the adsorption mechanism of pb ii and cd ii at the solid liquid interface of bapm kinetic models such as non linear lagergren pseudo first order model lagergren 1898 pseudo second order ho 2006 elovich model bouabidi et al 2018 and inta particle diffusion weber and morris 1963 were investigated the linear equations of the models are given by eqs 12 and 13 12 q t q e 1 e k 1 t 13 q t k 2 q e 2 t 1 k 2 q e t where qt mg g 1 and qe mg g 1 are the adsorption capacities of heavy metals at time t min and equilibrium state respectively while k1 and k2 are related to the rate constants for pseudo first and second order models fig 11 a b were used for testing the experimental data of adsorption of heavy metals onto bapm at optimum ph and temperature 45 c the values of the kinetic parameters r2 and χ2 calculated by the non linear regression analysis of kinetic models are given in table 2 it is clear that the values of r2 0 90 0 96 are extremely high with the lowest values of χ2 1 76 0 49 for the pseudo second order kinetic model fig 8b followed by pseudo first order kinetic model r2 0 59 0 72 and χ2 7 46 3 15 fig 8a meanwhile the qe cal values 37 40 25 50 mg g 1 obtained from pseudo second order model are found to agree with the qe exp values 37 90 27 60 mg g 1 with negligible deviation the qe cal values 35 94 26 47 mg g 1 estimated from pseudo first order kinetic model are different with least agreement to the experimental values qe exp 37 90 27 60 mg g 1 so the adsorption process for pb ii and cd ii onto bapm can be best described by pseudo second order kinetics and the rate limiting step may be chemisorption 3 5 thermodynamic studies in order to predict the thermodynamic behaviour of the sorption of pb ii and cd ii onto bapm thermodynamic parameters such as gibbs free energy change δg enthalpy change δh and entropy change δs were calculated using the gibbs and the van t hoff equation akkaya and güzel 2013 14 δ g o δ h o t δ s o 15 ln k c δ h o r δ s o r t the calculated parameters and van t hoff plot for thermodynamic studies at 25 35 and 45 c are given in table 3 and fig s2 the positive value of δh 45 33 kj mol 1 for pb ii and 36 99 kj mol 1 cd ii clearly indicates that adsorption process of pb ii and cd ii on bapm is endothermic in nature while the positive value of δs 0 168 kj mol 1 k 1 for pb ii and 0 128 kj mol 1 k 1 cd ii indicates the increased randomness between solid solution interfaces during adsorption process the negative value of δg increases as the temperature increases from 25 c to 55 c suggesting that the adsorption of pb ii and cd ii on bapm is spontaneous at higher temperature 3 6 comparison with other adsorbents a comparison of adsorption capacities of various adsorbent with present work has been listed in table 4 the table reveals that the present adsorbent shows a high adsorption capacity towards pb ii and cd ii the comparison of metal ions adsorption on nanocomposite and its individual components have been presented in fig 9 that clearly indicates that bapm nanocomposite exhibit highest adsorption efficiency towards both metal ions as compared to individual components fig 12 3 7 desorption and regeneration in order to avoid secondary pollution regeneration of synthesized nanocomposite material is very important for this purpose a regeneration study was observed with 0 1 m hcl 0 1 m naoh 0 1 m acetic acid and 0 1 m hno3 and best result was observed with 0 1 m hno3 maximum 92 the adsorption desorption graphs up to four cycles is depicted in fig 10 which indicates that the adsorption efficiency of bapm for pb ii and cd ii decreases continuously from first cycle to fourth cycle the reason for reduction in adsorption efficiency is that after each successive cycle some of the chemically adsorbed adsorbate does not get free by desorbing media the regeneration study for bapm shows that the material can be used up to fourth cycle because after fourth cycle there was significant loss in adsorption efficiency fig 13 3 8 mechanism of adsorption the adsorption mechanisms of heavy metal adsorption onto bapm are not yet fully understood the type of adsorbate adsorbent interaction depends on the chemistry of adsorbate solution ph chemical and physical nature of adsorbent in order to recognize the mechanism of the heavy metal adsorption onto bapm nanocomposite a number of different spectroscopic techniques such as ir edx and xrd were used there may be various adsorption mechanism through which adsorption is taking place such as surface complexation ion exchange and electrostatic interaction for example at lower ph the positively charge nh2 sh and oh groups of bapm have a strong coordinative affinity towards pb ii and cd ii by surface complexation through electrostatic interaction while this affinity decreases at higher ph as due to repulsive force between negatively charged adsorbate and lone pairs of the nh2 and oh groups of bapm the kinetic results in table 2 show that the mechanism is chemical adsorption and may follow the adsorption coupled reduction mechanism in which complex is formed between heavy metals and bapm the positively charged bapm nanocomposite due to the existence of sufficient functional groups such as nh2 sh and oh groups can form a complex with pb ii and cd ii at lower ph values and due to this complex formation the spent material will not cause secondary pollution to the environment 4 conclusion a novel pmma g alg cys bentonite bapm nanocomposite was synthesized and further used as a potential adsorbent for removal of pb ii and cd ii from aqueous solutions the bapm was characterized by using various analytical techniques such as ftir xrd sem tem and tga the optimum ph for the removal of these metal ions was observed at 5 for pb ii and 4 for cd ii respectively the equilibrium for adsorption of heavy metals on bapm was attained in 180 min for pb ii and 240 min for cd ii the equilibrium data was applied for both linear and non linear regression method using origin 8 1 and the data was found to be best fitted by langmuir model having maximum monolayer adsorption capacity of 60 24 mg g 1 for pb ii and 48 78 mg g 1 for cd ii by linear method the data obtained by non linear regression method is in good agreement with the data obtained by linear regression method the equilibrium data was found to follow the isotherm in the order of langmuir temkin sips freundlich model in both linear and non linear methods with a higher r2 and low χ2 value pseudo second order was found to be best described kinetic data suggesting the chemical adsorption to be rate determining step the thermodynamic parameters reveal that the adsorption of pb ii and cd ii on bapm is spontaneous and endothermic in nature the mechanism involved in the removal of heavy metals was electrostatic adsorption coupled reduction which is also evident from edx analysis acknowledgements the authors

12272,this paper introduces a gis based simulation method to study the temporal and spatial variation of the conservative contaminant plume in the subsurface environment of panchkula region haryana india numerical tools within gis framework were used to create the raster images of various flow and contaminant transport parameters the purpose of the study is to identify the plume area at different time and to investigate the variation of contaminant concentration with depth in perspective of the nature of the subsurface formations this method is intended to evaluate the risk assessment with minimum available data on urban groundwater flow and transport parameters the study investigates the temporal behavior of contaminant concentration at various depths i e 6 m z 260 m 26 m z 240 m and 36 m z 230 m below dumping site which is situated as 266 m above sea level a s l the study using porous puff shows that the contaminant plume area increases with an increase in time and the concentration decreases with the increasing depth below the dumping site it is observed that the plume area is larger at 36 m z 230 m depth as compared to plume area at other depths due to the presence of sandstone layer around the dumping site at 36 m z 230 m depth the ground water velocity is higher in sandstone layer at 36 m z 230 m depth which cause higher dispersion of source concentration in comparison to layers at 6 m z 260 m and 26 m z 240 m depths results show that this method is efficient in predicting contaminant plume behavior with fewer input parameters and less complexity the plume movement analysis can be performed as a precursor to facilitate the mitigation of contaminated regions around the dumping site graphical abstract fx1 keywords contaminant plume urban groundwater geographic information system gis advection dispersion spatio temporal 1 introduction groundwater movement is slower than the surface water which makes it more susceptible to pollution this groundwater contamination can remain for several years or decades due to longer residence time chapman 1996 usepa 1997 the contamination of water could be due to natural as well as anthropogenic causes there are numerous sources of groundwater contamination e g migration of unchecked leachate from waste containment facilities release of acidic chemical species from mining operations such as tailing ponds waste rock piles usepa 1997 zheng and wang 1999 alslaibi et al 2013 2017 one of the way of anthropogenic water contamination is due to migration of unchecked leachate from waste dumping sites and leachates that do not have proper leachate collection system which causes a serious threat to the surrounding areas chapman 1996 christensen et al 1968 meinardi et al 1995 narayana 2009 modeling mapping monitoring and managing the natural sources is quite challenging but anthropogenic activities that lead to water contamination could be studied and managed in a better and detailed way numerical flow and solute transport models like modflow mt3dms phreeqc have been used in various field studies to investigate the leachate transport from waste dumping sites anderson and cherry 2009 forghani and peralta 2017 ghoraba et al 2013 morio et al 2010 saba et al 2016 sracek et al 2004 generally the study of extent of the contamination is based on advection dispersion equations which can be used for spatial and temporal flow modeling for analyzing the spatial distribution geographic information system gis is widely used spatial distribution maps of various pollutants such as fluoride ali et al 2016 2018 bhuiyan et al 2016 chen et al 2012 usham et al 2018 arsenic bhattacharya et al 2006 shukla et al 2010 and other heavy metals bhuiyan et al 2016 kumar et al 2017 shekhar and sarkar 2013 sarkar and shekhar 2018 tirkey et al 2017 etc have been carried out to demarcate the pollutant distribution in the area further these maps were used in groundwater vulnerability studies to investigate the pollution potential from non point sources aliewi and al khatib 2015 singh et al 2011 on the other hand there are studies in which groundwater vulnerability and risk assessment have been carried out by integrating different layers such as soil permeability depth to water level groundwater seepage velocity into gis model kourgialas and karatzas 2015 nas and berktay 2006 zghibi et al 2016 these modeling techniques are quite complex and require large amount of data in comparison to simpler models while performance may be little higher for complex models alavi et al 2007 site specific intensive information of flow and transport parameters is generally not available over large areas in reality hence using complex contaminant transport modeling in real world scenarios is not recommended if comprehensive information about aquifer and transport properties is not available batu 2005 ghoraba et al 2013 morio et al 2010 therefore simple contaminant transport modeling methods are preferred which requires a lesser amount of data that is easily available these readily available datasets can be used in gis platform for time efficient study of contaminant transport phenomenon therefore we demonstrate the applicability of gis based simulation approach which depends upon advection dispersion mechanism for understanding the distribution of conservative non reactive contaminant in the subsurface environment of panchkula region haryana india the purpose of the present study is to investigate the influence of dumping site in panchkula region on contaminant plume movement in urban groundwater environment the objectives of the study are as follow analysis of groundwater flow movement and direction with time at various depths spatial and temporal variations in the movement of conservative contaminant plume studying the plume movement at different depths and their variation for shorter and longer period of duration in gis based simulation model the groundwater flow equation is solved using continuity equation and contaminant transport modeling is based upon analytical solution of advection dispersion equation which are explained in later sections time dependent movement of contaminant plume has been investigated at various depths below dumping site landfill site considered as point source short and long term analysis of plume movement has been carried out using solute transport properties of soil and local geology short term analysis refers to contaminant distribution after one year for one year at two month time interval while long term after five years at one year interval analysis involves the study of plume behavior after 5 years simulation period 2 study area the first planned city of india i e chandigarh is one of the fastest growing city of northern india thus creating a pressure on better management of groundwater availability it has grown to be called as tri city including chandigarh mohali and panchkula panchkula district is located in northern part of haryana india and lies between 30 26 30 55 n latitudes and 76 46 77 10 e longitudes total geographical area of the panchkula district is 898 sq km and it is divided into four development blocks namely barwala pinjore raipur rani and morni the ghaggar river is the main river flowing in the region there are sufficient ground and surface water sources in panchkula district however groundwater is a major source of irrigation in this area the surface elevation of panchkula district varies from 289 028 m to 1637 14 m above sea level a s l the location of the study area dumping site and bore wells are shown in fig 1 srtm shuttle radar topography mission elevation data is used for preparation of elevation map which has an

blue line represents the study area for which the analysis has been carried out using 12 bore well datasets and the dotted green line shows the plume area for which contaminant movement is finally shown in results 3 data and methodology the lithology data of exploratory wells observation wells piezometer productive wells of panchkula region haryana india has been collected from cgwb aquifer mapping report cgwb 2017 rockware software has been used to create 3d lithology model from the bore wells data which was further used to generate soil layers at various depths below dumping site the location of bore wells has been marked on google earth and 3d lithology model of the study area has been shown in fig 2 a and b respectively depth to water level saturated thickness and transmissivity data of available observation well in the panchkula district is taken from cgwb aquifer mapping report cgwb 2017 distribution of groundwater head which is defined as depth to water level is prepared using arcgis software and is shown in fig 3 for the preparation of groundwater head and aquifer thickness raster we have used inverse distance weighted idw interpolation technique transmissivity value varies in the region from 366 m2 day to 2249 m2 day cgwb 2017 constant transmissivity raster image has been created by taking an average of the minimum and maximum values which results in transmissivity of 1308 m2 day the groundwater tool available as a part of spatial analyst toolset in the arcgis 10 5 software has been used in the study groundwater flow and conventional advection dispersion equations were included into gis interface by tauxe 1994 these equations were incorporated as map algebra functions which work on spatially distributed hydro geological data groundwater toolbox in arcgis 10 5 consists of darcy flow particle track and porous puff analysis functions as an initial step groundwater seepage velocity is generated from input raster data of groundwater head porosity transmissivity and aquifer thickness using darcy flow function in the second step particle tracking is carried using groundwater flow data and finally concentration distribution in the subsurface is computed using porous puff function 3 1 darcy flow analysis groundwater flow modeling is performed using darcy s law considering the saturated porous medium bear 1972 the essential elements are groundwater head elevations at all the well locations effective porosity of the soil within the study area saturated thickness of the aquifer and hydraulic conductivity or transmissivity values these elements are defined continuously over the gridded two dimensional domain darcy flow function determines the groundwater seepage velocity and direction for each cell in the grid locally bear 1979 freeze and cherry 1979 it expresses vector flow field as magnitude and direction raster images it also calculates the groundwater volume balance for each cell i e the difference between flow into and out of the cell to calculate groundwater volume balance for each cell groundwater discharge through the cell must be calculated as discharge depend upon the aquifer flux so darcy s law must be extended to the two dimensional domain to find out the aquifer flux through the sidewalls of a rectangular cell which extends over the thickness of the aquifer tauxe 1994 the block centered approach mcdonald and harbaugh 1988 has been utilized in this study since the values of transmissivity saturated thickness and porosity are defined only at the grid cell centers cell thickness and porosities are averaged arithmetically while intercell transmissivity is approximated by harmonic average tauxe 1994 calculation of volumetric discharge q through the cell walls for an individual cell is based on the local and surrounding four values of head and averaged transmissivity mathematical computation is described in the following equations as bear 1979 aquifer flux and discharge in each

advected particle released from a given starting location in the flow field particle track is based on the predictor corrector algorithm haverkamp et al 1977 mcdonald and harbaugh 1988 and approximates the flow path by interpolating the local groundwater velocity field from the nearest cell centers and advancing through the field by steps of a fixed length the resultant magnitude and direction components of velocity vector are calculated according to eqs 8a and 8b velocity magnitude and direction rasters resulting from darcy flow analysis are given as input to particle track analysis this analysis runs until either specified track time expires or the particle migrates off the raster or into the depression 3 3 porouspuff analysis advection dispersion modeling is performed by porouspuff function available in the arcgis groundwater tool which is a gis based simulation model the porouspuff function is limited to only instantaneous injection of a point source in the study area centroid of mass injected at the source location advected through the flow path calculated by particle track however dispersion is modeled as gaussian distribution around the center of mass as dispersed puff or plume tauxe 1994 the two dimensional advection dispersion eqs 9a and 9b is used to simulate concentration distribution and described below as zheng and bennett 2002 zheng and wang

from cgwb report these 19 bore well locations along with their coordinates are given in table 1 this data has been used to prepare three dimensional lithology model of the study area the bore log data of these locations have been used for the preparation of groundwater head saturated thickness and transmissivity raters conservative contaminant movement has been analyzed spatially and at different depth level for a short term and long term time short term movement refers to plume behavior after 1 year by repeated application of porouspuff at 2 4 6 8 10 and 12 month time period while long term movement refers to plume behavior after 5 years by repeated application of porouspuff at 1 2 3 4 and 5 year time period firstly short term plume behavior is analyzed and then the long term movement of contaminant plume is studied slicing of 3d lithology is performed at 5 m interval depth to generate soil layers it is observed that the soil type varies majorly at 6 m z 260 m 26 m z 240 m and 36 m z 230 m depth below dumping site in this study z 260 m level refers to the soil layer at 6 m depth from dumping site similarly z 240 m and z 230 m level corresponds to soil layer at 26 m and 36 m below from dumping site respectively porosity rasters have been created at various depths such as 6 m z 260 m 26 m z 240 m and 36 m z 230 m considering aforementioned soil map layers contaminant movement at different depths i e 6 m z 260 m 26 m z 240 m and 36 m z 230 m is observed for short term and long term time the groundwater seepage velocity direction and magnitude raster images obtained from particle track were used as input parameters for contaminant transport study a simulation period of 10 years 3650 days was applied for particle tracking for all depths input flow and transport parameters are presented in table 2 gelhar et al 1992 stated that the longitudinal dispersivity tends to be one tenth of the flow path in the longitudinal direction while the ratio of longitudinal to the transverse dispersivity is taken as 10 gelhar et al 1992 porosity values of different lithological units viz layer 1 clay layer 2 sand gravel and boulder and layer 3 sandstone are assumed as 0 485 0 33 and 0 2075 respectively as mentioned in various references demarsily 1986 freeze and cherry 1979 manger 1963 it has been reported that the total municipal solid waste generated from the panchkula region haryana india is about 150 t per day rana et al 2017 therefore in this study point source mass is assumed for investigation and 0 1 of the solid waste is assumed leaking from the panchkula dumping site 4 1 variation of groundwater flow magnitude and direction darcy flow analysis is used to determine groundwater flow magnitude and direction in the panchkula region at various depths from the dumping site it is observed that the groundwater seepage velocity varies from 0 00028 m day to 6 918 m day at 6 m z 260 m depth groundwater flow direction is towards south west of the dumping site this results in movement of the center of mass of plume along the seepage flow direction particle track analysis is used to determine the length of the flow path covered by the contaminant plume center for various depths this is performed to study the behavior of groundwater velocity at various depths and at various geologic formations at 6 m z 260 m depth particle travels a distance of 1907 62 m after 10 years of the time period while 2499 41 m distance is moved by particle for 26 m z 240 m depth level and 2934 59 m distance covered after 10 years for 36 m z 230 m depth 4 2 short term analysis of contaminant plume short term analysis has been carried out for three depth levels namely 6 m z 260 m 26 m z 240 m and 36 m z 230 m to investigate the plume movement with depth convolution plume is generated by the repeated application of the porouspuff function a series of six puffs is generated using the same source location and parameters each puff has been started with a source mass of 150 106 mg and released at 2 months time interval plume movement for the short term period at various depths i e 6 m z 260 m 26 m z 240 m and 36 m z 230 m is shown in fig 4 the contour of concentration value is shown in different colour line representing various time periods for example red colour contour line represents the concentration value after 2 months while 8 month concentration value is shown by blue contour line in fig 4 undoubtedly as the time increases the concentration value decreases and the area of plume increases it is observed that the maximum contaminant concentration value decreases from 457 24 mg m3 at 6 m z 260 m depth to 451 11 mg m3 at 36 m z 230 m depth there is less variation observed with depth in comparison to longitudinal and transverse directions it is observed that the contaminant concentration value is decreasing and area of contaminant plume is increasing with time variation of contaminant concentration with longitudinal distance is also studied along the curvilinear particle track line at different depths for a short term period as presented in the following section it is done to investigate the influence of soil layers on dispersion and further effect of dispersion processes on plume movement variation of contaminant concentration with longitudinal distance for short term plume movement is presented in fig 5 spatial variation is presented in the plume direction starting from dumping site for short term time period analysis it can be observed that rising limb is almost same for all the layers while falling limb of the curve is different for different depths influence of source condition is dominant at distances near to dumping site in comparison to dispersion processes however spreading of plume and influence of dispersion is seen at distances far away from dumping site as shown in fig 5 4 3 long term analysis of contaminant plume long term analysis has been carried out for three depth levels i e 6 m z 260 m 26 m z 240 m and 36 m z 230 m to investigate the plume movement with depth contaminant plume movement for long term period at different depths i e 6 m z 260 m 26 m z 240 m and 36 m z 230 m is shown in fig 6 a series of five puffs is generated using the same source location and parameters each puff has been started with a source mass of 150 106 mg and released at 1 year time interval the contour of concentration value is shown in different colour line representing various time periods fig 6 for example red colour contour line represents the concentration value after 1 year while blue contour line shows the concentration value after 4 year time period as described in fig 6 contaminant plume area increases and concentration value decreases with time it has been predicted that the maximum contaminant leaching from dumping site could reach up to 70 53 mg m3 at 6 m z 260 m depth to 65 20 mg m3 at 36 m z 230 m depth center of the mass of plume reaches 822 7 m distance along the track line after 5 years period for 6 m z 260 m depth while it reaches 1270 27 m distance for 26 m z 240 m and 1808 27 m distance for 36 m z 230 m depth contaminant concentration variation with longitudinal distance is also studied along the curvilinear particle track line at different depths for long term time as presented in following section spatial variation of contaminant concentrations longitudinally for long term analysis at various depths is shown in fig 7 spatial variation is presented in the plume direction starting from dumping site for long term time period analysis it has been observed that the contaminant concentration disperses more at 36 m z 230 m depth as compared to other layers linear variation is observed at the short travel distance while the non linear behavior is observed at longer distances from dumping site temporal variation of contaminant concentration at a particular location is also analyzed to study the plume behavior with time temporal variation of contaminant concentration at a location for various depths below dumping site is shown in figs 8 a 8 c xl represents the distance from dumping site in the direction of plume movement peak concentration is obtained at location close to the dumping site it is seen that the variation of concentration is very less up to 20 m down gradient distance however large variation is observed after 50 m down gradient distance from the dumping site contaminant concentration decreases with the distance due to longitudinal dispersion as we move away from the dumping site the present study is the hypothetical case considered while actual field data of urban groundwater head soil layers transmissivity and saturated thickness has been used for simulation there are studies in which contaminant plume movement is studied using numerical flow and transport models ghoraba et al 2013 morio et al 2010 nas and berktay 2006 investigated the nitrate concentration distribution in the groundwater of konya city turkey using statistical approach in gis environment alslaibi et al 2017 used sesoil model to predict the nitrate concentration at the bottom of the unsaturated zone they assessed the risk of nitrate transport from the unlined landfill to the subsurface layers these studies indicated the significance of contaminant transport investigation at the field scale as even conservative type of solute can cause soil and groundwater pollution therefore in the present analysis non reactive type of contaminant has been considered to study the influence of geologic formation dispersion processes on plume movement the investigation we have carried out leads to following takeaways from the gis based contaminant transport modeling groundwater velocity at 36 m z 230 m depth is highest which results in highest travel distance covered by the center of mass of plume it has been observed from the short term plume movement analysis that the plume area is largest at 36 m z 230 m depth as compared to other depths i e 6 m z 260 m 26 m z 240 m this shows the dilution of source concentration due to dispersion processes it may happen due to the geologic formation sandstone layer present at that depth as demonstrated in fig 2 b and table 1 as geologic formation influences the dispersion processes it is evident from table 1 that the clay is present around the dumping site at 6 m z 260 m depth due to which groundwater seepage velocity is less therefore mechanical dispersion is less at 6 m z 260 m depth and it cause less dilution of source concentration in comparison to sandstone layer present at 36 m z 230 m depth long term plume movement study analyzes dilution of contaminant plume with time results obtained from the long term analysis show similar behavior as that of short term analysis 5 conclusions temporal and spatial distribution of contaminant plume was evaluated using gis technique for the panchkula region of haryana india an attempt has been made to understand the influence of advection and hydrodynamic dispersion on contaminant transport from the dumping site using groundwater analysis tool in arcgis software this study has been carried out considering the plume movement at various depths and at different time scale in urban groundwater environment particle track analysis demonstrates the total path traveled by the center of mass of contaminant plume the major findings and contributions of the study are summarized as under distance traveled by contaminant plume is highest for 36 m z 230 m depth in comparison to other layers which is due to soil layer present at that depth it is observed that the contaminant concentration decreases with the depth porouspuff analysis determines the spatial distribution of contaminant it is observed that the contaminant plume area increases with an increase in time dilution of source concentration is majorly due to dispersion processes for non reactive contaminant short term and long term plume movement analysis can be used to identify contaminated regions around dumping site and to facilitate the adoption of mitigating measures the present study has demonstrated the use of gis for contaminant transport modeling and estimating plume movement from dumping site it also establishes the fact that contrary to the normal expectation that the contaminant plume travel more at shallower depth it is rather subsurface geology which controls the distance traveled by the plume in future temporal monitoring of urban groundwater from observation wells can be done for the particular contaminant to validate the plume variation behavior studies based on the use of gis techniques can estimate the impacts of dumping site on subsurface contamination over any region of

12272,this paper introduces a gis based simulation method to study the temporal and spatial variation of the conservative contaminant plume in the subsurface environment of panchkula region haryana india numerical tools within gis framework were used to create the raster images of various flow and contaminant transport parameters the purpose of the study is to identify the plume area at different time and to investigate the variation of contaminant concentration with depth in perspective of the nature of the subsurface formations this method is intended to evaluate the risk assessment with minimum available data on urban groundwater flow and transport parameters the study investigates the temporal behavior of contaminant concentration at various depths i e 6 m z 260 m 26 m z 240 m and 36 m z 230 m below dumping site which is situated as 266 m above sea level a s l the study using porous puff shows that the contaminant plume area increases with an increase in time and the concentration decreases with the increasing depth below the dumping site it is observed that the plume area is larger at 36 m z 230 m depth as compared to plume area at other depths due to the presence of sandstone layer around the dumping site at 36 m z 230 m depth the ground water velocity is higher in sandstone layer at 36 m z 230 m depth which cause higher dispersion of source concentration in comparison to layers at 6 m z 260 m and 26 m z 240 m depths results show that this method is efficient in predicting contaminant plume behavior with fewer input parameters and less complexity the plume movement analysis can be performed as a precursor to facilitate the mitigation of contaminated regions around the dumping site graphical abstract fx1 keywords contaminant plume

and cherry 2009 forghani and peralta 2017 ghoraba et al 2013 morio et al 2010 saba et al 2016 sracek et al 2004 generally the study of extent of the contamination is based on advection dispersion equations which can be used for spatial and temporal flow modeling for analyzing the spatial distribution geographic information system gis is widely used spatial distribution maps of various pollutants such as fluoride ali et al 2016 2018 bhuiyan et al 2016 chen et al 2012 usham et al 2018 arsenic bhattacharya et al 2006 shukla et al 2010 and other heavy metals bhuiyan et al 2016 kumar et al 2017 shekhar and sarkar 2013 sarkar and shekhar 2018 tirkey et al 2017 etc have been carried out to demarcate the pollutant distribution in the area further these maps were used in groundwater vulnerability studies to investigate the pollution potential from non point sources aliewi and al khatib 2015 singh et al 2011 on the other hand there are studies in which groundwater vulnerability and risk assessment have been carried out by integrating different layers such as soil permeability depth to water level groundwater seepage velocity into gis model kourgialas and karatzas 2015 nas and berktay 2006 zghibi et al 2016 these modeling techniques are quite complex and require large amount of data in comparison to simpler models while performance may be little higher for complex models alavi et al 2007 site specific intensive information of flow and transport parameters is generally not available over large areas in reality hence using complex contaminant transport modeling in real world scenarios is not recommended if comprehensive information about aquifer and transport properties is not available batu 2005 ghoraba et al 2013 morio et al 2010 therefore simple contaminant transport modeling methods are preferred which requires a lesser amount of data that is easily available these readily available datasets can be used in gis platform for time efficient study of contaminant transport phenomenon therefore we demonstrate the applicability of gis based simulation approach which depends upon advection dispersion mechanism for understanding the distribution of conservative non reactive contaminant in the subsurface environment of panchkula region haryana india the purpose of the present study is to investigate the influence of dumping site in panchkula region on contaminant plume movement in urban groundwater environment the objectives of the study are as follow analysis of groundwater flow movement and direction with time at various depths spatial and temporal variations in the movement of conservative contaminant plume studying the plume movement at different depths and their variation for shorter and longer period of duration in gis based simulation model the groundwater flow equation is solved using continuity equation and contaminant transport modeling is based upon analytical solution of advection dispersion equation which are explained in later sections time dependent movement of contaminant plume has been investigated at various depths below dumping site landfill site considered as point source short and long term analysis of plume movement has been carried out using solute transport properties of soil and local geology short term analysis refers to contaminant distribution after one year for one year at two month time interval while long term after five years at one year interval analysis involves the study of plume behavior after 5 years simulation period 2 study area the first planned city of india

data of available observation well in the panchkula district is taken from cgwb aquifer mapping report cgwb 2017 distribution of groundwater head which is defined as depth to water level is prepared using arcgis software and is shown in fig 3 for the preparation of groundwater head and aquifer thickness raster we have used inverse distance weighted idw interpolation technique transmissivity value varies in the region from 366 m2 day to 2249 m2 day cgwb 2017 constant transmissivity raster image has been created by taking an average of the minimum and maximum values which results in transmissivity of 1308 m2 day the groundwater tool available as a part of spatial analyst toolset in the arcgis 10 5 software has been used in the study groundwater flow and conventional advection dispersion equations were included into gis interface by tauxe 1994 these equations were incorporated as map algebra functions which work on spatially distributed hydro geological data groundwater toolbox in arcgis 10 5 consists of darcy flow particle track and porous puff analysis functions as an initial step groundwater seepage velocity is generated from input raster data of groundwater head porosity transmissivity and aquifer thickness using darcy flow function in the second step particle tracking is carried using groundwater flow data and finally concentration distribution in the subsurface is computed using porous puff function 3 1 darcy flow analysis groundwater flow modeling is performed using darcy s law considering the saturated porous medium bear 1972 the essential elements are groundwater head elevations at all the well locations effective porosity of the soil within the study area saturated thickness of the aquifer and hydraulic conductivity or transmissivity values these elements are defined continuously over the gridded two dimensional domain darcy flow function determines the groundwater seepage velocity and direction for each cell in the grid locally bear 1979 freeze and cherry 1979 it expresses vector flow field as magnitude and direction raster images it also calculates the groundwater volume balance for each cell i e the difference between flow into and out of the cell to calculate groundwater volume balance for each cell groundwater discharge through the cell must be calculated as discharge depend upon the aquifer flux so darcy s law must be extended to the two dimensional domain to find out the aquifer flux through the sidewalls of a rectangular cell which extends over the thickness of the aquifer tauxe 1994 the block centered approach mcdonald and harbaugh 1988 has been utilized in this study since the values of transmissivity saturated thickness and porosity are defined only at the grid cell centers cell thickness and porosities are averaged arithmetically while intercell transmissivity is approximated by harmonic average tauxe 1994 calculation of volumetric discharge q through the cell walls for an individual cell is based on the local and surrounding four values of head and averaged transmissivity mathematical computation is described in the following equations as bear 1979 aquifer flux and discharge in each

average seepage velocity vector along the x and y direction is obtained by dividing darcy flux q by the averaged effective porosity of the cell as described in the following eqs 6a and 6b 6a v x i 1 2

advected particle released from a given starting location in the flow field particle track is based on the predictor corrector algorithm haverkamp et al 1977 mcdonald and harbaugh 1988 and approximates the flow path by interpolating the local groundwater velocity field from the nearest cell centers and advancing through the field by steps of a fixed length the resultant magnitude and direction components of velocity vector are calculated according to eqs 8a and 8b velocity magnitude and direction rasters resulting from darcy flow analysis are given as input to particle track analysis this analysis runs until either specified track time expires or the particle migrates off the raster or into the depression 3 3 porouspuff analysis advection dispersion modeling is performed by porouspuff function available in the arcgis groundwater tool which is a gis based simulation model the porouspuff function is limited to only instantaneous injection of a point source in the study area centroid of mass injected at the source location advected through the flow path calculated by particle track however dispersion is modeled as gaussian distribution around the center of mass as dispersed puff or plume tauxe 1994 the two dimensional advection dispersion eqs 9a and 9b is used to simulate concentration distribution and described below as zheng and bennett 2002 zheng and wang

from cgwb report these 19 bore well locations along with their coordinates are given in table 1 this data has been used to prepare three dimensional lithology model of the study area the bore log data of these locations have been used for the preparation of groundwater head saturated thickness and transmissivity raters conservative contaminant movement has been analyzed spatially and at different depth level for a short term and long term time short term movement refers to plume behavior after 1 year by repeated application of porouspuff at 2 4 6 8 10 and 12 month time period while long term movement refers to plume behavior after 5 years by repeated application of porouspuff at 1 2 3 4 and 5 year time period firstly short term plume behavior is analyzed and then the long term movement of contaminant plume is studied slicing of 3d lithology is performed at 5 m interval depth to generate soil layers it is observed that the soil type varies majorly at 6 m z 260 m 26 m z 240 m and 36 m z 230 m depth below dumping site in this study z 260 m level refers to the soil layer at 6 m depth from dumping site similarly z 240 m and z 230 m level corresponds to soil layer at 26 m and 36 m below from dumping site respectively porosity rasters have been created at various depths such as 6 m z 260 m 26 m z 240 m and 36 m z 230 m considering aforementioned soil map layers contaminant movement at different depths i e 6 m z 260 m 26 m z 240 m and 36 m z 230 m is observed for short term and long term time the groundwater seepage velocity direction and magnitude raster images obtained from particle track were used as input parameters for contaminant transport study a simulation period of 10 years 3650 days was applied for particle tracking for all depths input flow and transport parameters are presented in table 2 gelhar et al 1992 stated that the longitudinal dispersivity tends to be one tenth of the flow path in the longitudinal direction while the ratio of longitudinal to the transverse dispersivity is taken as 10 gelhar et al 1992 porosity values of different lithological units viz layer 1 clay layer 2 sand gravel and boulder and layer 3 sandstone are assumed as 0 485 0 33 and 0 2075 respectively as mentioned in various references demarsily 1986 freeze and cherry 1979 manger 1963 it has been reported that the total municipal solid waste generated from the panchkula region haryana india is about 150 t per day rana et al 2017 therefore in this study point source mass is assumed for investigation and 0 1 of the solid waste is assumed leaking from the panchkula dumping site 4 1 variation of groundwater flow magnitude and direction darcy flow analysis is used to determine groundwater flow magnitude and direction in the panchkula region at various depths from the dumping site it is observed that the groundwater seepage velocity varies from 0 00028 m day to 6 918 m day at 6 m z 260 m depth groundwater flow direction is towards south west of the dumping site this results in movement of the center of mass of plume along the seepage flow direction particle track analysis is used to determine the length of the flow path covered by the contaminant plume center for various depths this is performed to study the behavior of groundwater velocity at various depths and at various geologic formations at 6 m z 260 m depth particle travels a distance of 1907 62 m after 10 years of the time period while 2499 41 m distance is moved by particle for 26 m z 240 m depth level and 2934 59 m distance covered after 10 years for 36 m z 230 m depth 4 2 short term analysis of contaminant plume short term analysis has been carried out for three depth levels namely 6 m z 260 m 26 m z 240 m and 36 m z 230 m to investigate the plume movement with depth convolution plume is generated by the repeated application of the porouspuff function a series of six puffs is generated using the same source location and parameters each puff has been started with a source mass of 150 106 mg and released at 2 months time interval plume movement for the short term period at various depths i e 6 m z 260 m 26 m z 240 m and 36 m z 230 m is shown in fig 4 the contour of concentration value is shown in different colour line representing various time periods for example red colour contour line represents the concentration value after 2 months while 8 month concentration value is shown by blue contour line in fig 4 undoubtedly as the time increases the concentration value decreases and the area of plume increases it is observed that the maximum contaminant concentration value decreases from 457 24 mg m3 at 6 m z 260 m depth to 451 11 mg m3 at 36 m z 230 m depth there is less variation observed with depth in comparison to longitudinal and transverse directions it is observed that the contaminant concentration value is decreasing and area of contaminant plume is increasing with time variation of contaminant concentration with longitudinal distance is also studied along the curvilinear particle track line at different depths for a short term period as presented in the following section it is done to investigate the influence of soil layers on dispersion and further effect of dispersion processes on plume movement variation of contaminant concentration with longitudinal distance for short term plume movement is presented in fig 5 spatial variation is presented in the plume direction starting from dumping site for short term time period analysis it can be observed that rising limb is almost same for all the layers while falling limb of the curve is different for different depths influence of source condition is dominant at distances near to dumping site in comparison to dispersion processes however spreading of plume and influence of dispersion is seen at distances far away from dumping site as shown in fig 5 4 3 long term analysis of contaminant plume long term analysis has been carried out for three depth levels i e 6 m z 260 m 26 m z 240 m and 36 m z 230 m to investigate the plume movement with depth contaminant plume movement for long term period at different depths i e 6 m z 260 m 26 m z 240 m and 36 m z 230 m is shown in fig 6 a series of five puffs is generated using the same source location and parameters each puff has been started with a source mass of 150 106 mg and released at 1 year time interval the contour of concentration value is shown in different colour line representing various time periods fig 6 for example red colour contour line represents the concentration value after 1 year while blue contour line shows the concentration value after 4 year time period as described in fig 6 contaminant plume area increases and concentration value decreases with time it has been predicted that the maximum contaminant leaching from dumping site could reach up to 70 53 mg m3 at 6 m z 260 m depth to 65 20 mg m3 at 36 m z 230 m depth center of the mass of plume reaches 822 7 m distance along the track line after 5 years period for 6 m z 260 m depth while it reaches 1270 27 m distance for 26 m z 240 m and 1808 27 m distance for 36 m z 230 m depth contaminant concentration variation with longitudinal distance is also studied along the curvilinear particle track line at different depths for long term time as presented in following section spatial variation of contaminant concentrations longitudinally for long term analysis at various depths is shown in fig 7 spatial variation is presented in the plume direction starting from dumping site for long term time period analysis it has been observed that the contaminant concentration disperses more at 36 m z 230 m depth as compared to other layers linear variation is observed at the short travel distance while the non linear behavior is observed at longer distances from dumping site temporal variation of contaminant concentration at a particular location is also analyzed to study the plume behavior with time temporal variation of contaminant concentration at a location for various depths below dumping site is shown in figs 8 a 8 c xl represents the distance from dumping site in the direction of plume movement peak concentration is obtained at location close to the dumping site it is seen that the variation of concentration is very less up to 20 m down gradient distance however large variation is observed after 50 m down gradient distance from the dumping site contaminant concentration decreases with the distance due to longitudinal dispersion as we move away from the dumping site the present study is the hypothetical case considered while actual field data of urban groundwater head soil layers transmissivity and saturated thickness has been used for simulation there are studies in which contaminant plume movement is studied using numerical flow and transport models ghoraba et al 2013 morio et al 2010 nas and berktay 2006 investigated the nitrate concentration distribution in the groundwater of konya city turkey using statistical approach in gis environment alslaibi et al 2017 used sesoil model to predict the nitrate concentration at the bottom of the unsaturated zone they assessed the risk of nitrate transport from the unlined landfill to the subsurface layers these studies indicated the significance of contaminant transport investigation at the field scale as even conservative type of solute can cause soil and groundwater pollution therefore in the present analysis non reactive type of contaminant has been considered to study the influence of geologic formation dispersion processes on plume movement the investigation we have carried out leads to following takeaways from the gis based contaminant transport modeling groundwater velocity at 36 m z 230 m depth is highest which results in highest travel distance covered by the center of mass of plume it has been observed from the short term plume movement analysis that the plume area is largest at 36 m z 230 m depth as compared to other depths i e 6 m z 260 m 26 m z 240 m this shows the dilution of source concentration due to dispersion processes it may happen due to the geologic formation sandstone layer present at that depth as demonstrated in fig 2 b and table 1 as geologic formation influences the dispersion processes it is evident from table 1 that the clay is present around the dumping site at 6 m z 260 m depth due to which groundwater seepage velocity is less therefore mechanical dispersion is less at 6 m z 260 m depth and it cause less dilution of source concentration in comparison to sandstone layer present at 36 m z 230 m depth long term plume movement study analyzes dilution of contaminant plume with time results obtained from the long term analysis show similar behavior as that of short term analysis 5 conclusions temporal and spatial distribution of contaminant plume was evaluated using gis technique for the panchkula region of haryana india an attempt has been made to understand the influence of advection and hydrodynamic dispersion on contaminant transport from the dumping site using groundwater analysis tool in arcgis software this study has been carried out considering the plume movement at various depths and at different time scale in urban groundwater environment particle track analysis demonstrates the total path traveled by the center of mass of contaminant plume the major findings and contributions of the study are summarized as under distance traveled by contaminant plume is highest for 36 m z 230 m depth in comparison to other layers which is due to soil layer present at that depth it is observed that the contaminant concentration decreases with the depth porouspuff analysis determines the spatial distribution of contaminant it is observed that the contaminant plume area increases with an increase in time dilution of source concentration is majorly due to dispersion processes for non reactive contaminant short term and long term plume movement analysis can be used to identify contaminated regions around dumping site and to facilitate the adoption of mitigating measures the present study has demonstrated the use of gis for contaminant transport modeling and estimating plume movement from dumping site it also establishes the fact that contrary to the normal expectation that the contaminant plume travel more at shallower depth it is rather subsurface geology which controls the distance traveled by the plume in future temporal monitoring of urban groundwater from observation wells can be done for the particular contaminant to validate the plume variation behavior studies based on the use of gis techniques can estimate the impacts of dumping site on subsurface contamination over any region of

12273,karst aquifers capable of storing and transmitting large amount of water are the main source of drinking water in many regions worldwide their excessive permeability leads to an enhanced vulnerability to retain and spread the contamination accordingly from sustainability perspective the environmental economic and social impacts of karst contamination on water resources management are gaining more attention in this study an overview of hydrogeological processes and concepts regarding groundwater flow and contaminant transport in karstic systems is presented followed by a short discussion on surface water and groundwater interaction due to the complexity of karstic systems different approaches have been developed by researchers for investigating and understanding hydrogeological processes and groundwater behavior in karst which are reviewed herein additionally groundwater contamination issues and the most common and effective remediation techniques in karstic terrains are discussed lastly modeling techniques and remote sensing methods as beneficial and powerful tools for assessing groundwater flow and contaminant transport in karst terrains are reviewed and evaluated in each section relevant research works conducted for puerto rico are discussed and some recommendations are presented to complement the ongoing hydrogeological investigations on this island graphical abstract fx1 keywords groundwater karst remediation hydrogeology modeling puerto rico 1 introduction sustainable water resources management is a crucial concern in most countries across the globe only 3 of total water on the earth is considered as fresh water resources and approximately 30 of that is accessible as groundwater which is vital for human health ecosystem energy industry and other water dependent topics shiklomanov 1993 karst aquifers are responsible for providing potable water for 40 and 25 of the us and world s population respectively ghasemizadeh et al 2012 the increasing demand by residential industrial and agricultural uses have caused groundwater depletion and decreased quality in many regions from sustainable development perspective environmental economic and social impacts are consequences of water pollution in any region of the world hence careful attention should be paid to preserve water resources with particular reference to karst aquifers this study provides a comprehensive review of hydrological concepts and novel investigation and modeling techniques followed by a discussion of groundwater contamination and remediation techniques this paper aims to present and review the work of other researchers in the recent years especially after 2010 and to discuss the latest improvements that have been made regarding groundwater quality and quantity assessment in each section the associated research work that has been done for puerto rico is presented to better understand what research works have been conducted and what are the research gaps on karst aquifers of this island puerto rico as the case study location is considered a territory of the united states us the island is located in northeastern side of caribbean sea and have an estimated population of 3 6 million castro prieto et al 2017 several surface water and groundwater resources across the island provide residents with fresh water and are used for agricultural industrial and energy based purposes fig 1 exhibits the geographical location of puerto rico generalized geological setting of the island surficial geological formation of north coast limestone aquifer and cross sectional view of geological layers along the north coast due to the presence of karstic aquifers with high level of heterogeneity and anisotropy in northern coast of the island water from precipitation can rapidly percolate into underground this rapid movement makes karst aquifer highly vulnerable to emerging contamination from several sources of contamination induced by agricultural and industrial activities in addition to proximity to urban areas cherry 2001 moreover highly heterogeneous karstic aquifers with a lot of conduits cause high rate of water level fluctuation even in small temporal scaling yu et al assessed the patterns of temporal scaling of groundwater level fluctuation for the karstic aquifer of puerto rico and pointed out that according to multifractal or singularity spectrums there are smoother fluctuations in the alluvial aquifer and rougher ones in the northern karst aquifer yu et al 2016 2 karst aquifers 2 1 characterization comprising of chemically soluble rocks with large passages or network of conduits and caves inside karst aquifers are very permeable and capable of storing and transmitting large amount of water therefore karst regions have great potential of providing habitants with fresh water quinn et al 2006 in fact 20 25 of the world s population depends on water supplies from karst aquifer directly or indirectly approximately 10 of the world s land surface areas have karst aquifer beneath them this percentage is higher in some areas such as in europe where it is roughly 35 ford and williams 2007 until recent years the boundaries of karst aquifers around the world were not recognized accurately hence by taking advantage of gis tools recent exploration of karst aquifers and global lithological map that was developed before chen et al completed the first world karst aquifer map wokam their map distinguishes continuous carbonate rocks and discontinuous carbonate rocks and include major karst springs wells and caves chen et al 2017 many other resources show karst map of the us or the world distribution of karst aquifers within the united states and its territories based on usgs data is presented herein fig 2 detailed geological investigations in puerto rico show that limestone dolomite gypsum and anhydrite are the most common materials forming puerto rican karst aquifers fig 1 karst aquifers are individually different with unique work frame and characteristics and they should be studied case by case stevanović 2015 two important characteristics of karst aquifers are heterogeneity and anisotropy which make it hard for hydrogeologists and researchers to develop models using simplifying assumptions karsts have the most complex system amongst terrains causing lot of uncertainties and errors in developed models for studying and predicting their behavior bakalowicz 2005 also the recharge and discharge rate of karst springs can vary a lot due to several reasons such as fluctuations in water table level caused by hydrological events or seasonal variations gárfias soliz et al 2009 table 1 elaborates hydrogeological characteristics of three main aquifer types porous media fractured rock and karst system based on astm d 5717 95 standard astm 1995 a karst aquifer system comprises several elements such as caves conduits sinkholes and springs limestone karst aquifers are common in many areas around the world including puerto rico cherry 2001 rafael et al 2016 florida xu et al 2016 mexico bauer gottwein et al 2011 and china luo et al 2016 karsts usually are evolved from fractured or fractured porous rock networks after several years through carbonate dissolution creating large passages and caves several modeling methods have been employed to simulate the evolution of karst aquifers from fractured or porous fractured rock systems kaufmann 2003 2016 kiraly 2003 2 2 hydraulic conductivity in groundwater hydrology hydraulic conductivity quantifies the ability of soil in transferring water based upon various aquifer materials hydraulic conductivity can range from 10 cm s for gravel to 10 10 cm s 1 for shale hydraulic conductivity of karst limestone is the greatest comparing to many other aquifer types fig 3 laboratory field and numerical methods are 3 main means of measuring hydraulic conductivity numerical and finite element based methods are used for determining vertical and horizontal hydraulic conductivities kalbus et al 2006 smith et al 2016 usually in karst aquifers where subsurface heterogeneity exists determining hydraulic parameters such as k requires a complicated analysis because this parameter is spatially and temporally variable throughout the aquifer hydraulic tomography is a novel method that can be used for imaging the heterogeneity in karstic terrains illman et al 2007 moreover in karst aquifers the average range of k can vary depending on several factors such as geology slope level of heterogeneity and karstification angulo et al 2011 studied hydraulic conductivity in karst areas by applying water injection tests and electrical resistivity logging similarly different researchers reported experimental values for hydraulic conductivity based on their research approach and case study area chen et al 2011 fu et al 2015 sudicky et al 2010 as it is shown in fig 3 k of limestone karst aquifer which is dominant in northern coast of puerto rico can be assumed in the range of 10 4 5 cm s 1 which demonstrates high level of permeability in karst aquifers the estimated values of k in different locations of north coast karst aquifer of puerto rico can be found in the water resources investigation reports rodriguez martinez 1995 or similar sources for fine scale studies or modeling purposes 2 3 what methods can be used to study karst aquifers based on the aforementioned complex characteristics of karst several techniques and tools associated with modified and reformed conventional methods such as hydrologic and hydraulic methods geophysical and geological methods modeling techniques and tracer tests have been employed by researchers for understanding the behavior of karst aquifers goldscheider and drew 2007 stevanović 2015 giudici et al 2012 and hu et al 2009 studied karst aquifers by taking advantage of modeling methods in addition taking advantage of geological methods which help understanding the aquifer geometry and hydraulic properties such as permeability in addition to orientation and characteristics of potential flow paths can boost the accuracy of modeling results goldscheider and drew 2007 geophysical techniques can also be employed in conjunction with geological methods to understand geologic structures and overburden thickness of the aquifer chalikakis et al 2011 ford and williams 2007 goldscheider and drew 2007 2 4 surface water and groundwater interaction swgwi in karst interaction of surface water sw and groundwater gw plays a critical role in understanding hydrological behavior of a basin this interconnectivity incorporates the topographical geological and morphological characteristics of terrains generally water recharge from inflow of gw into the riverbed water discharge from river bed to aquifer and also losing and gaining water for both sw and gw in some river segments are three main processes that can occur in swgwi winter et al 1998 high permeability and low attenuation capacity of karst aquifers make mixture of sw and gw problematic for fresh water use in karst terrains rainfall infiltration and streamflow response to base flow discharge are separated by a much shorter delay in karst compared to other aquifer types bayless et al 2014 due to the complex patterns of sw and gw flow in karst several studies have denied coincide of sw and gw drainage divides a river that disappears in a sw basin and reappears in another basin can be mentioned as an example which depicts uncertainties in understanding the source of water and its associated dissolved contaminants in karst winter et al 1998 usually carbonate rocks are present at the land surface in karstic terrains however in some cases the bedrock is covered by other deposits e g surficial deposits which is called mantled karst e g edwards aquifer in south central texas in mantled karst shallow gw has interaction with lakes and wetlands in a way similar to that in sandy glacial and dune terrains the small difference in interaction of these two can be tied with the buried carbonate rocks dissolution of buried carbonate rocks can lead to slumpage of an overlying confining bed allowing water to flow readily through the confining bed consequently changes in hydraulic heads within the aquifers underlying the confining bed can affect the lakes and wetlands winter et al 1998 in addition to south central texas mantled karst can be found in north central florida this area has several sinkhole lakes and unconsolidated deposits overlie the highly soluble limestone of the upper floridan aquifer when unconsolidated surficial deposits slump into sinkholes which form in the underlying limestone most land surface depressions containing lakes are made hence in most of the times sinkholes in the bedrock underlying lakes affect the hydrology of the lakes although the lakes are not located directly within limestone winter et al 1998 the general term surface water can be referred to wastewater on the ground brackish water of the sea ocean and water in lakes and rivers attempts have been made to minimize the interaction between polluted sw and gw in karstic areas by placing an impermeable seal along canal bottoms or riverbeds constructing small dams weirs building grouting curtains changing the flow direction of surface waters plunging ponors and creating reactive barriers by pumping freshwater into aquifer milanović et al 2015 modeling hydrographic analysis and hydrogeological mapping are among common desktop techniques which are used to assess swgwi in karst fleckenstein et al 2010 hydrographic analysis which monitors stream flow time series and define base flow component can be used easier compared to the other two methods however it is only applicable for gaining stream conditions hence it may not give accurate result if used for a karst aquifer hydrogeological mapping method which provides comprehensive understanding of gw systems around streams and their related hydrogeological systems can describe hydrogeological components of a gw system at a course scale gleeson et al 2014 thus it can be used for regional assessment of karst aquifers in addition modeling methods can simulate water flow and contaminant transport around streams and within aquifer using mathematical equations although they can predict the behavior of a hydrogeological system their application in karst is limited usually simplifying assumptions are made during modeling process of swgwi in karst which result in uncertainties however by taking advantage of new techniques technologies and or by combing this method with other in situ measurements researchers have shown the application and promising future of modeling methods guay et al 2013 also field observations seepage measurement hydrochemical methods such as environmental isotopes hydrochemistry tracers and also hydrometric and geophysical analysis are beneficial field tools which can be used for describing swgwi in karst gonzález pinzón et al 2015 martinez et al 2015 in the recent years use of methods associated with geophysics e g resistivity em radiometrics or remote sensing e g landsat has been reported for mapping landscape features that indicate or control connectivity meyerhoff et al 2013 however because these methods require specific equipment technical expertise and logistical support researchers have had tendency to use more practical and easy to use methods such as hydrometrics and water budgets analysis brodie et al 2007 sometimes because of unknown and complex catchment boundaries analyzing water budgets can also be problematic goldscheider and drew 2007 hartmann et al 2014 kovács et al 2005 among field tools tracers have been widely used due to their capability of providing independent ways of validating or refuting conventional traditional methods of analyzing data and describing swgwi baskaran et al 2009 jankowski 2007 by using tracers such as florescent dyes aquifer parameters such as recharge and discharge and fluid transport properties can be determined martinez et al 2015 however tracer studies require careful planning e g meeting environmental regulatory controls and dosage control in many cases isotropic techniques and artificial tracers are used for determining residence time and water age and for understanding the water movement through conduits the main advantages of these techniques are determining linear flow velocities and information on contaminant transport and delineating catchment areas although obtained information and data from tracers are often reliable and unequivocal limited applicability in large areas with long transit times and also change of color and toxicity concerns are some of the disadvantages of using isotropic techniques and artificial tracers goldscheider et al 2008 jones and banner 2003 morales et al 2017 reviewing the literature it seems like the use of tracers has been more frequent and beneficial for understanding the interconnectivity between sw and gw in karst terrains compared to other field methods katz et al 1997 for example evaluating the connection between sinking streams and down gradient springs it should also be noted that temperature change analysis and water budget assessment can be coupled with other methods to achieve more accurate and validate results brodie et al 2007 due to complexity of karst s behavior different types of integrated techniques and or less common approaches have been employed by researchers to evaluate their performance in describing the interconnectivity between sw and karst gw brian katz et al 1997 chu et al 2016 loáiciga 2001 rugel et al 2016 sutton and screaton described swgwi of a karst aquifer basin in florida by analyzing river discharge and a transient numerical gw flow modeling their modeling results highlight the prominence of spatiotemporal variations in head gradients that can affect streams and karst aquifers connections and aquifer martial dissolution sutton et al 2014 bailly comte et al studied the hydrodynamic interactions between gw and surface water in a karst watershed in southern france their focus was on the effect of gw on the genesis and propagation of surface floods they showed the role of initial water level in a karst aquifer in predicting the type of hydraulic connection between sw and gw during flood events bailly comte et al 2009 moreover the analysis of sw and karst gw interaction conducted by bayless et al 2014 showed that analytical methods such as hydrograph separation and hysteretic loops can be used for identifying bounding conditions within the watershed chu et al studied swgwi in a karst aquifer in china using gw levels data and hydrochemistry analyses together with isotope data based on hydrogeological field investigations their cross correlation analysis showed that precipitation results in increasing gw level with a 2 month lag time moreover their spectral analysis depicted the possible inter connectivity between gw level gw exploitation and precipitation chu et al 2016 rugel et al conducted longitudinal sampling on a creek in georgia usa they realized there are stepwise gw inputs from the upper floridan aquifer in addition to specific conductance increase at 5 out of 50 sampled reaches the results of sampling along the 50 km study river section revealed that 42 of total gw inputs entered through discrete preferential flow pathways were located within these 5 sampling locations rugel et al 2016 in north coast limestone aquifer of puerto rico with presence of rivers and lagoons and occurring intense precipitation and seawater intrusion swgwi can have a major impact in the quality of fresh water within karst aquifers of the region however we failed in our attempts to find any detailed research works associated with swgwi in karst aquifers of northern pr hence collecting field data doing research and developing models to fully understand the mechanism of swgwi in northern part of the island is strongly recommended despite the fact that numerous methods have been developed for describing sw gw interrelationship there are still uncertainties and lack of sufficient knowledge for fully understanding 1 the time lag between gw pumping and its influence on sw 2 relationship between gw pumping and river losses and 3 exact recharge and discharge points in streams jankowski 2007 wu et al assessed uncertainties in swgwi modeling employing a probabilistic collection method they evaluated the applicability of the frame work through an integrated sw gw model for a basin in china and asserted that in describing complex swgwis modeling uncertainties depend on the output and have significant spatiotemporal variability hence employing a systematic uncertainty analysis can be extremely helpful in understanding swgwi wu et al 2014 and also in groundwater model development process of karst aquifers engelhardt et al 2014 3 groundwater contamination and remediation techniques karst aquifers which are portrayed as high permeable soil rock systems with caves and fractures inside and also recharged by sinkholes and rivers have shown high vulnerability to contamination kačaroğlu 1999 the formation of solution channels and sinkholes facilitates the intrusion of seawater and contaminated storm water and wastewater into the aquifer this is the main reason of accelerating the spread of contaminants in karst more than other aquifer types i e porous media and fractured rock basically fate and transport processes are not only different for each contaminant depending on the physical and chemical properties of the contaminant but also are particularly different in karst compared to other aquifers a few studies assessed historical gw contamination in north coast limestone karst aquifer of puerto rico and suggested beneficial remedial actions and water resources management approaches biaggi 1995 padilla et al 2011 3 1 contaminant types and sources of contamination agricultural industrial residential commercial and municipal development are considered as the main sources of groundwater pollution in recent decades fetter 2001 wakida and lerner 2005 in particular leakage of storage tanks chemical spills landfills fertilizers and pesticides sanitation systems untreated waste discharge and sewage are some of the main sources of contamination due to anthropogenic activities el alfy and faraj 2017 generally regardless of the source of contamination pathogens organic compounds lapworth et al 2012 metals yao et al 2012 and other inorganic compounds e g nitrates chlorides are often found in groundwater panagiotakis and dermatas 2017 vidal montes et al 2016 the most commonly found contaminants in karst gw are presented below 3 1 1 nitrate nitrate is one of the most common gw contaminants according to several studies almasri and kaluarachchi 2004 babiker 2004 point sources of nitrogen nitrate leachate such as old septic systems landfills wastewater holding ponds and leaks from cracks in sewer pipelines can cause gw nitrate contamination almasri 2007 kendall and aravena 2000 wakida and lerner 2005 additionally non point sources of n leaching such as fertilizer use in agricultural areas play a very significant role in increasing gw nitrate contamination in a usgs report with focus on manati and vega baja municipalities in puerto rico nitrate occurrence and contamination were assessed it was identified that the major sources of nitrate contamination in the karst aquifer of the region are use of fertilizers for cultivation of pineapples and also septic tank effluent in rural and un sewered no sewer system areas conde costas and gómez gómez 1999 3 1 2 ppcp nowadays treating water contaminated by new chemical compounds mainly originated from pharmaceutical and personal care products ppcp are a big concern metcalfe et al 2011 concentration of ppcps such as antibiotics anti inflammatories lipid regulators psychiatric drugs stimulants insect repellants and sunscreen agents is higher than regulatory criterion in many areas usually wastewater and contaminated surface water landfills septic systems and sewer leakages are considered as common sources of ppcp contamination especially in karstic areas dodgen et al 2017 sui et al 2015 high concentration of ppcps in karst aquifers of switzerland and jordan was reported by morasch 2013 and zemann et al 2015 respectively moreover dodgen et al assessed ppcp concentration in karst aquifers of southwestern illinois in the usa and found out that no single water quality or meteorological parameter was significantly associated with ppcp contamination across all site profiles they mentioned septic tanks effluent as a probable source of ppcps dodgen et al 2017 in another study it was realized that due to high transmissivity of the shallow alluvium the gw below alluvial deposits is subjected to pollution caused by ppcp residues from wastewater effluents through artificial aquifer recharge sui et al 2015 no studies related to ppcp contamination of gw in pr were found however it is expected that due to large number of septic tanks and poor effectiveness of wastewater treatment plants to deal with ppcps in addition to use of mosquito repellent creams because of zika virus groundwater quality will be affected by ppcp contamination in the island hennessey et al 2016 3 1 3 metals in carbonated water of the karst aquifer at natural ph heavy metals such as cr ni pb and cd often precipitate as hydroxides and carbonates heavy metal transport as an episodic phenomenon mostly occurs when metals are adsorbed onto small particles of soil when hydraulic condition of gw flow facilitates suspension of small particles heavy metals can migrate down the flow path vesper et al 2003 also elevated concentration of metalloids such as arsenic has raised concerns in many regions heavy metals and metalloids in groundwater can be present in areas where there are mining operations or mine waste dumps industrial activities and urban waste are known as possible sources of metal loid s leachate in karstic gw alloway 2013 additionally urban surface runoff containing high concentration of metals goes through karst aquifers via sinkholes and conduit network bonneau et al 2017 heavy metal ions are also frequently leached naturally from rocks and soils within karst media and can be introduced with acidic deposition drew and hötzl 1999 in karst gw of puerto rico high concentration of metals mainly arsenic lead and total chromium have also been detected mainly at superfund sites fig 4 usepa 2003 3 1 4 lnapl and dnapl light non aqueous phase liquids lnapls have tendency to float on the surface of groundwater table they are usually present behind obstructions in cave streams within karst aquifers unlike lnapls dense non aqueous phase liquids dnapls sink to the bottom of the aquifer and have tendency to be stored in lower points of the bottom of conduits moreover it was reported that they tend to concentrate in open conduits ghasemizadeh et al 2012 lnapl and dnapl transport in karst aquifers is contingent upon runoff and gw flow hydraulics lnapls can be forced into the karst system as plug flow and dnapls can be mobilized by transporting sediments at the bottom layer in contrast to dissolved contaminants the transport of napls in aquifers is strongly influenced by buoyancy effects and surface tension properties this makes the transport behavior of napls less directly related to groundwater flow and more difficult to predict vesper et al 2003 by conducting transport experiments using non aqueous phase tce in a laboratory scale karst limestone rock carmona de jesús and padilla showed that although dnapls prefer to move downward they can also move along non vertical conduits when subjected to gw flow fields furthermore it was demonstrated that once dnapls penetrate preferential flow pathways subsequent injections often follow the same route when they reach limited flow areas dnapls will be accumulated and transported through diffusive processes after dissolution carmona de jesús and padilla 2015 3 1 5 volatile organic compounds voc volatile and semi volatile organic compounds vocs and svocs respectively flow along with the subsurface waters in karst but their volatility results in migrating the vapor phases of these contaminants through the vadose zone field 2017 a few studies assessed the contamination of chlorinated volatile organic compounds cvoc in pr padilla et al 2011 rivera et al 2017 historical studies since 1980 show that mainly contaminants with chlorinated solvents including tce dichloroethene chloroform carbon tetrachloride tetrachloroethene tetrachloroethane dichloroethane and methylene chloride have high concentrations causing public health concerns padilla et al 2011 several wells and sites fig 4 were considered as the national priority list npl superfund sites and remediation actions for treating water in these sites begun years ago yu et al 2015 regarding studying the groundwater pollution and understanding the potential exposure pathways of contaminants some methods such as using tracers and gis has been employed by researchers steele valentín and padilla 2009 the abundancy of superfund sites and high concentration of contaminants in gw recourses of puerto rico are suspected to be responsible for increasing rate of pre term birth highest amongst us states and territories in the island mathews and macdorman 2011 however since 2006 this rate has been declined from 20 to 11 4 due to remediation actions and enhanced awareness of habitant regarding water borne diseases march of dimes website 2016 rutigliano 2016 as it appears in fig 4 there is abundance of superfund sites in npr mainly due to industrial activities improper management of landfills accidental spills unidentified waste disposals or residential septic systems most of these sites are located in upper aquifer of north coast limestone aquifer system on the border of arecibo and barceloneta there are 3 superfund sites which indicated high level of contamination in groundwater of that area in karst aquifers of pr analysis of contaminant transport requires more sophisticated approaches coupled with continuous field assessments and data collection hu et al 2009 yu et al assessed the concentration of cvocs such as trichloroethylene tce perchloroethene pce carbon tetrachloride ct chloroform or trichloromethane tcm and methylene chloride dcm in northern puerto rico based on historical data they stated that the hydrogeological conditions of the karst aquifer intrinsic properties and the biological environment in addition to the source origin were greatly associated with the spatiotemporal distribution patterns of the cvocs since water resources pollution in northern puerto rico has caused a negative social economic and environmental impact long term consistent monitoring of water quality in addition to implementation of remedial actions were suggested yu et al 2015 3 1 6 pathogens pathogens such as viruses and bacteria are easily transported in karstic systems this is because of high drainage potential of karst and lack of soil layers which can act as filters hence pathogens retain their activity in karst conduits for a long time vesper et al 2003 fecal coliforms fecal streptococci and often a particular emphasis on escherichia coli have been studied more compared to viruses in karst aquifers these organisms often indicate gw contamination caused by sewage or animal waste studies regarding bacterial contamination in west virginia mathes 2000 ontario conboy and goss 2000 and western ireland thorn and coxon 1992 show the presence of fecal bacteria in carbonate wells white 2016 muldoon et al 2016 assessed sources of fecal contamination in the silurian dolomite aquifer of wisconsin using enteric pathogens moreover it was found out that high percentage of bacteria travels within karst media by adsorbing on small particulates mostly clay mahler et al 2000 white 2016 resources for assessment of pathogens in karst aquifers of puerto rico are scarce by assessing the north karst belt zone of puerto rico acosta colón suggested that mesofauna diversity can be a possible indicator of pathogenic and opportunistic species it was also recommended that in addition to characterizing mesofauna and species more knowledge about the diet of mesofauna organisms is needed to clearly identify species that can be used as indicators of cave microbial pathogens acosta colón 2016 3 1 7 chloride coastal aquifers such as north coast limestone aquifer of puerto rico are susceptible to seawater intrusion which can increase the salinity chloride concentration of groundwater arfib et al 2007 mongelli et al 2013 having a hydraulic connection to the sea karstic coastal aquifers can be characterized by having groundwater flow in conduits sub marine freshwater springs and intrusion of seawater through the aquifer via conduit networks fleury et al 2007 due to susceptibility of karstic coastal aquifers developing a sustainable plan by using integrated models for managing and monitoring water resources within these aquifers is essential sreekanth and datta 2015 same as pathogens not much research has been conducted regarding seawater intrusion in coastal karst aquifer of puerto rico although zack et al stated that the freshwater saltwater interface of the north coast limestone aquifer of pr is probably seaward and freshwater discharges to the seabed by extracting water from public supply wells which results in decreasing gw level seawater intrusion can be a potential problem in npr zack et al 1987 not much chloride concentration data is available within usgs database and other resources hence conducting a field sampling for a few years is recommended to assess the potential risk of chloride based gw contamination 3 2 remediation strategies in karst aquifers based on increased understanding of contaminant transport behaviors and efficacies of various remediation technologies usepa emphasizes that combination of source and dissolved phase plume remediation is preferable strategy for remediation of many sites usepa 2013 however in addition to the challenges in costs and the extend of the treatment efficiencies arising at different sites remediation in karst is even more challenging than in other hydrogological environments due to the presence of highly permeable conduits of unknown extent parise et al 2015 fig 5 for example sinreich 2014 stated that at the field scale selecting the specific remediation technique for each contaminant requires comparative tracing experiments using contaminant surrogates in spite of the dominant preferential flow pathways solute and colloid tracers interact with aquifer material hence if reactive and or non persistent contaminants are present in conduits hydro chemical properties of contaminants are more important than aquifer intrinsic vulnerability in the transport process and arrival of contaminants at karst springs most remediation processes in karst have lower efficiency compared to other aquifer types because of their time dependent characteristics sinreich 2014 also suggested that the assumption of high vulnerability of karst may not be true for all conditions and should be identified based on fate and transport of specific contaminants thus no preference should be considered for karst gw treatment methods because they can have different efficiency and cost based on contaminant properties and site condition another example related to pump and treat application field 2017 confirmed varying levels of success due to extreme heterogeneity and anisotropy of karst limited diameter length of the conduits and the behavior of flow regime within the solution conduits it was realized that pump and treat was barely used by agencies for remediating contaminated karst gw usepa 2013 as concluded by parise et al 2015 main difficulties with achieving feasible plume containment in karst with pump and treat systems are finding all preferential flow paths of the dissolved contaminant to the points of compliance and hydraulically stopping this transport by pumping both contaminated and clean water due to all these challenges it was pointed out that contaminated karst aquifers tend to fall under the special category of technical impracticability ti waivers this means regardless of how much effort and financial resources are expended actual remediation cannot be accomplished because of technical implausibility especially for aquifers contaminated by dnapls field 2017 usepa 2012 it was found that most of the case studies associated with ti waivers were those in karstic hydrogeological setting deeb et al 2011 however in situ thermal treatment in situ chemical oxidation and in situ bioremediation are increasingly being applied at fractured rock and karst site for source and plume remediation while point of use and point of entry has been evaluated and proposed strategy for karst groundwater treatment randrianarivelo et al 2017 3 2 1 source and plume remediation in situ thermal treatment in situ chemical oxidation isco and in situ bioremediation are the main in situ remediation methods which have commonly been used in karst aquifers with certain limitations beyke et al 2014 parise et al 2015 studies have shown that identifying the location of conduits and major fractures is necessary for an efficient remedial action it was reported that electrical resistance heating technique was successfully implemented for removing dnapls and tce in a karst aquifer in alabama but preferential pathways within karst aquifers leading to high seepage velocity can cause heat loss hodges et al 2014 the preferential flow pathways within karst system which can disperse injected materials usually are problematic for other treatment methods such as isco and bioremediation as well regarding in situ bioremediation hashim et al pointed out that biological or biochemical methods which use microbes and nutrients for bio precipitation enzymatic oxidations bio surfactants and sulfate reductions for removing heavy metals seems to be applicable and efficient in karst because injecting nutrients and electron donors is relatively inexpensive and non toxic hashim et al 2011 byl and williams stated that in areas isolated from the major groundwater flow paths low migration of contaminant may possible to allow biodegradation of chlorinated ethenes and fuel if favorable microorganisms food sources and geochemical conditions are present byl et al 2001 byl and williams 2000 the potential for biodegradation of chlorinated organic solvents was in a karst aquifer was confirmed at the tce contaminated site at lewisburg tennessee indicating that natural attenuation should not be disregarded byl et al 2002 also randrianarivelo et al conducted remedial investigations of a karst aquifer in pennsylvania they selected chemical oxidation in conjunction with monitored natural attenuation or land use control as preferred remediation method alternative based on the hydrogeological conditions of the site and the extent of the delineated contamination plumes randrianarivelo et al 2017 regarding isco remediation method by assuming that the contaminated area is well identified and the injection fluid has the right dosage and residence time the possibility of delivering injection fluid to the contaminated area with minimal error is the major challenge similar to other fluid based remediation methods in karst aquifers moreover for achieving the highest efficiency in treating contaminants diffused into the rock matrix or moving with slow advective transport oxidizing agents should remain in the contaminated area however rapid movement of water through preferential flow pathways dilutes the oxidizing agents thus it can be asserted that application of isco in karst aquifers is limited regardless of limitations in applying treatment methods for karst aquifers randrianarivelo et al 2017 pointed out chemical oxidation as a beneficial techniques for gw remediation the main challenge associated with these techniques is to identify the zone that requires treatment based on site conditions and the type of contaminants the most effective technology should be employed assessment of remediation technique requires an appropriate monitoring approach for locations consist of springs streams extraction systems and previously tested wells and comprehensive hydrogeological and water quality sampling data randrianarivelo et al 2017 3 2 2 remediation by mitigating exposure pathways exposure pathways often play a crucial role in spreading the contamination through karst aquifers steele valentín and padilla delineated the potential exposure pathway of contaminants in vega alta puerto rico the pathway starts from superfund sites and is directed toward atlantic ocean moreover it covers a noticeable lateral extension which impacts wells wetlands and streams in the area steele valentín and padilla 2009 because of interconnectivity between conduits and fractures within karst aquifer controlling exposure pathways is more difficult compared to other aquifer types however mitigating exposure pathways can be done by treating at the tap replacing drinking water supplies treating spring flow using active and passive methods land cover control using fences signage deed restriction and local law enforcement in spite of their high treatment capabilities these techniques often require long term operation and maintenance costs randrianarivelo et al 2017 one of the promising cost effective methods for minimizing the exposure pathways is electrochemical treatment environmentally friendly option of using solar power independent no other remedial actions needed and controllable with regard to the rates of redox reactions the high removal percentage for various contaminants in karst groundwater has been achieved in laboratory and pilot scale studies fallahpour 2016 gregor et al 2017 mao et al 2012 4 application of modeling in karst in order to predict the behavior aquifers based on hydrological variations groundwater models have been developed by hydrogeologists and water resources scientists in addition some models are developed to chemically analyze the water quality and to simulate fate and transport of contaminants a groundwater flow model is able to exhibit precise representation of hydrological and geological systems and also it can give a real insight into relationship and interactions between system elements modeling using computer programs can be truly beneficial when there are karst aquifers in the case study location this is mainly due to the fact that karst aquifers are very heterogeneous and anisotropic and have a complex structure ergo developing a relatively sophisticated model is the best option for simulating these types of aquifers 4 1 model parameters and development depending on the soil type and water table level the percolation rate regarding the movement of water from saturated zone to groundwater differs ritchey and rumbaugh 1996 additionally the impact of human interferences with natural water cycle which can be caused mostly by irrigation and pumping water from wells should be taken into account actually a groundwater model can determine how much it is perilous for an aquifer and also for the ecosystem if certain level of human interference exists this can help developing water resources management plans that can not only help optimizing water extraction but also can preserve the environment and natural resources drew and hötzl 1999 other physical parameters such as topographical and geological information of the region that is going to be modeled should be given to the modeling platform peterson and wicks 2006 anisotropy of aquifers regarding hydraulic conductivity which is a parameter that can have a dissimilar value in each direction can only be considered in two or three dimensional models nowadays by developing computer programs and also due to the need of acquiring more valid results as the output of modeling three dimensional models are more acceptable despite the possible complex procedure of setting them up anderson et al 2015 in fact while one dimensional models can be applied for vertical flow in multiple horizontal layers and two dimensional models considers water flow in a vertical plain and this is repeated in multiple parallel vertical plains as well a three dimensional model subdivides the flow region into smaller cells with possible different properties regarding aquifer condition soil characteristics and water flow ebrahim 2014 mostly numerical analysis and tools should be used to solve complex differential equations of groundwater flow in fact a groundwater flow model is able to represent conceptual model of an aquifer mathematically and this mathematical representation enables researchers to solve the governing equations numerically by computers ebrahim 2014 world meteorological organization 2009 using numerical solutions for solving groundwater flow equations in a three dimensional scale is beneficial for models which follow the flow domain discretization approach usually in a groundwater flow model hydraulic head at each cell center and groundwater flow rate between cells can be considered as outcomes moreover impacts on streamflow because of pumping or long term impacts of current pumping can be assessed checking the consistency of datasets and parameters and also defining e framework for future studies related to groundwater and aquifer condition are two prominent products of a groundwater model hartmann et al 2014 ritchey and rumbaugh 1996 researchers and hydrogeologists have tried to develop groundwater models which can predict and simulate the groundwater flow in the karst aquifers in a regional or local scale regional groundwater models are capable of optimizing groundwater resources development plans analyzing water budget of aquifers and assessing regional flow systems zhou and li 2011 published a review paper regarding regional groundwater modeling and discussed their characteristics and associates drawbacks sauter assessed the quantification and prediction of regional groundwater flow and transport in a karst aquifer in germany he discussed how the most appropriate modeling tool can be selected and how it can be used for simulation for a specific case study location by analyzing spring flow spatiotemporal variations of groundwater levels and hydraulic parameters the model was able to successfully describe the karst aquifer system in the studied location sauter 1992 fig 6 depicts the schematic diagram of the process of developing a groundwater model 4 2 spatially lumped models and distributed parameter models ghasemizadeh et al categorized groundwater models into different groups based on their capabilities and characteristics due to high level of heterogeneity and anisotropy in karst aquifers accurately understanding of their behavior and distribution has always been challenging this has forced modelers to employ approximate based approaches and consequently consider the impact of the uncertainties caused by these approaches in their models hence spatially lumped models slm and distributed models dm or spatiotemporal distributed models sdm were introduced as two general approaches in modeling karst aquifers ghasemizadeh et al 2012 world meteorological organization 2009 spatially lumped models comprises of concentrated elements at spatially singular points whereas the elements are spatially distributed in distributed models hence in distributed systems physical quantities are spatially and temporally dependent spatially lumped or global models do not consider spatial alternation of flow patterns and are supposed to simulate a global chemical hydrological response at the aquifer output point for example spring discharge point with regard to inputs of the aquifer e g rivers groundwater recharge points net runoff etc ghasemizadeh et al 2012 singh 2014 assessing temporal alternations is an approach that spatially lumped models take to describe the global water balance and hydrological behavior of an aquifer moreover in spatially lumped models some factors that cause complexity in calculations and simulating are neglected due to simplifying assumptions and hence using only the global parameters in simple ordinary linear differential equations and also low data requirements are some of their properties that can be considered when trying to select the best modeling approach for groundwater flow and transport simulation although these models cannot produce accurate results especially in karstic areas they have been widely used by researchers in the areas where less data is available or only the prediction of groundwater flow spring discharge and groundwater levels is necessary long 2015 panagopoulos 2012 hydrograph chemograph analysis dewandel et al 2003 linear storage models or rainfall discharge models butscher and huggenberger 2008 and soft computing techniques such as fuzzy logic mohd adnan et al 2013 rezaei et al 2013 genetic algorithm mckinney and lin 1994 nicklow et al 2010 and artificial neural network ann hu et al 2008 are three main approaches with regard to spatially lumped models that have been adopted by hydrological modelers in contrast distributed models take complex parameters involved in groundwater flow and transport into account in these models dependent hydrological parameters and boundary conditions can be spatiotemporally variable and this will require the equations to be solved numerically and based on partial differential equations asher et al 2015 kuniansky 2016 also due to the fact that all variables should be defied to the system collecting more data and paying careful attention to details in this type of modeling is demanded which can make it more challenging dong et al 2012 long and gilcrease 2009 for karst aquifer modeling different type of distributed models based on the level of simplified assumptions have been used each of the developed models and methods treats complexity of karst aquifer differently and simulates groundwater flow based on its own logic and assumptions equivalent porous medium epm double porosity or continuum method dpm discrete fracture network dfn discrete channel or conduit network dcn and hybrid models hm are five common modeling approaches in distributed systems that have their own characteristics which will be discussed shortly in the following ghasemizadeh et al 2012 dfn can be subcategorized into discrete singular fracture set approach dsfs and discrete multiple fracture set dmfs approaches sometimes epm and dpm are also mentioned as single continuum porous equivalent approach scpe and double continuum porous equivalent approach dcpe respectively in the literature it is worth mentioning that employing hybrid models which are the result of integrating discrete models and epm approach and are also called coupled continuum pipe flow models can be beneficial in many cases regarding modeling complex hydrological systems such as karst aquifers kiraly 1998 liedl et al 2003 fig 7 demonstrated schematic configuration of the aforementioned distributed modeling approaches bauer et al have developed a numerical model to describe the influence of exchange flow between conduits and fissured system they found out that under conditions of early karst evolution conduit development is faster hence exchange flow plays an important role in developing early karst evolution in limestone aquifers bauer et al 2003 also some researchers have employed numerical modeling approaches to describe groundwater flow and transport in rough fractures briggs et al 2014 and karst aquifers faulkner et al 2009 however modeling karst aquifers cannot only be carried out by numerical approaches barrett and charbeneau 1998 furthermore for simulating the genesis of karst aquifer systems a numerical couple reactive network model comprising of a 2d porous continuum flow module a discrete pipe network for modeling flow and transport in the conduits and a carbonate dissolution module was developed by clemens t et al 1997 4 3 computer models and programs modflow is the most common groundwater modeling code that has been used due to its capability of simulating complex groundwater flows in a three dimensional scale working based on finite difference method and block centered approach modflow simulates the groundwater within the aquifer by considering different type of layers underground i e confined unconfined or both and also different recharge or discharge sources such as areal recharge groundwater flow to wells runoff caused by rainfall flow to riverbeds spring flow etc harbaugh 2005 the initial version of modflow modflow 2000 was released in the year 2000 and five years later the updated version modflow 2005 started gaining attentions from groundwater modelers and hydrogeologists to enhance the application of modflow 2000 two models have been introduced by usgs which are vsf and mf2k gwt basically vsf is a version of modflow 2000 that in addition to the ability of modflow 2000 to model groundwater flow using a finite difference method in a 3 d scale can be applicable for variably saturated flow vsf thoms et al 2006 mf2k gwt is an integrated model with modflow 2000 that have the ability to simulate groundwater flow and solute transport u s geological survey website 2012 nevertheless some programs that were independent to modflow but developed by usgs were released as well such as hst3d 3 d heat and solute transport model that is able to simulate ground water flow and associated heat and solute transport in a 3d scale its capabilities can be used in analyzing problems associates with landfill leaching seawater intrusion hot water geothermal systems etc kipp 1997 the most updated version of modflow program modflow 6 was released recently in this program any number of models can be used for concurrent simulation these models can have inter connection with each other and this can help solving complex hydrogeological problems in many cases such as the conditions in karst aquifers also within this framework multiple local gw models can be coupled with regional scale models langevin et al 2017 moreover conduit flow package cfp which can be coupled with modflow 2005 can facilitate simulation of karstic geometry and gw movement and consequently increase the accuracy of gw flow modeling in conduits shoemaker et al 2007 after releasing modflow 2005 several associated models and packages were introduced and released based on numerous approaches and techniques as an example mt3d model which is a modular comprehensive numerical three dimensional solute transport model was developed by usgs this model has been designed to work very well regarding simulation of solute transport and reactive solute transport in complex hydrological systems being connected to modflow which is the usgs groundwater flow simulator mt3d is able to simulate and analyze advection dominated transport especially solute transport without refining new models bedekar et al 2016 lautz and siegel used mt3d and modflow to simulate groundwater and surface water mixing in the hyporheic zone they took advantage of this model due to its ability to simulate advective transport and source and sink mixing of solutes lautz and siegel 2006 taking advantage of the features in modflow and mt3d a new computer program seawat was released to assist hydrogeologists in simulating three dimensional variable density and transient groundwater flow that can be coupled with solute transport in the last version of seawat version 4 the effect of fluid viscosity and density fluctuations can be considered in simulation of groundwater flow and solute transport this will allow the users to recognize this model as a tool that can be used in a wide range of simulation practices including seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers langevin 2009 langevin et al 2008 xu employed seawat in his dissertation to study seawater intrusion into a coastal karstic aquifer in florida and achieved accurate results it is worth mentioning that seawater intrusion can be considered as a substantial source of brackish water in coastal aquifers such as karst aquifer in north coast of puerto rico xu 2016 in addition feflow finite element subsurface flow system is a finite element package for simulating 3d and 2d fluid density coupled flow contaminant mass salinity and heat transport in the subsurface it has several applications including regional groundwater management saltwater intrusion seepage through dams and levees land use and climate change scenarios groundwater remediation and natural attenuation and also groundwater surface water interaction as an example a study has been conducted to simulate groundwater dynamics in an irrigation and drainage network in uzbekistan using feflow after model calibration and validation the results show high level of accuracy and can be used for hydrogeological management plans diersch 2014 khalid awan et al 2015 sutra is another model that has been released for simulating 2 d saturated unsaturated fluid density dependent flow with energy transport or chemically reactive single species solute transport capable of analyzing saltwater intrusion and energy transport it uses a 2d hybrid finite element and integrated finite difference approach to approximate the governing flow and transport equations that explain the two interdependent processes it should be noted that the 3d version of this model has also been released recently in sutra s version 2 2 specification of time dependent boundary conditions can be identified without programming fortran code sutra can also describe chemical species transport including absorption production and decay processes and assess well performance and pumping test data voss and provost 2002 for instance hussain et al 2015 used sutra in their paper to study coastal aquifer systems that are subjected to seawater intrusion visual modflow flex platform an integrated modeling environment that connects modflow and mt3d is able to simulate complex 3d groundwater flow and contaminant transport its graphical user interface and 3d visualization capabilities in addition to its ability to simulate groundwater flow and contaminant transport can gain attention of hydrological and groundwater modelers as an example of work varghese et al successfully developed a visual modflow flex model for simulation of groundwater flow in a region in india kumar and singh 2015 varghese et al 2015 chemflo 2000 which is interactive software for simulating water and chemical movement in unsaturated soils enables users to simulate groundwater flow and chemical fate and transport in vadose zones the model can be used as a tool that can enhance the understanding of unsaturated flow and transport processes in this model water movement and chemical transport are modeled using the richards and the convection dispersion equations respectively the equations are solved numerically using the finite differences approach nofziger and wu 2003 another 3d finite element based model for simulating flow and transport is 3dfemfat this model works for saturated unsaturated heterogeneous and anisotropic media its typical applications include infiltration agriculture pesticides sanitary landfill hazardous waste disposal sites density induced flow and transport saltwater intrusion etc its flexibility and feasibility in simulating a wide range of practical problems especially by employing its transport module has made it valuable software for researchers and transport modelers also its application in studying seawater intrusion in coastal aquifer has been verified by some scientists lathashri and mahesha 2016 park et al 2012 regarding surface water and groundwater interaction which was discussed in the previous sections in detail gsflow groundwater and surface water flow was released by usgs in 2008 as an integrated tool that is able to couple groundwater and surface water flow models by taking advantage of the approaches used in usgs precipitation runoff modeling system prms and the usgs modular groundwater flow model modflow and modflow nwt meteorological and hydrological data such as rainfall sunny hours and temperature in addition to groundwater stresses and initial boundary conditions are involved as inputs for the process of simulation in this model gsflow can also take into account the impact of land cover change climate change and groundwater extraction on surface water and groundwater flow for spatiotemporally variable situations markstrom et al 2008 however regarding its limitations it was asserted by researchers that its ability to simulate surface water and groundwater in karst aquifers with high level of heterogeneity is not guaranteed fulton et al 2015 by taking advantage of a control volume finite difference method modflow usg un saturated grid version of modflow is able to simulate groundwater flow and its related processes this version of modflow supports different types of structured and unstructured grids this capability is extremely useful when high resolution along rivers and around wells is needed in addition modflow usg couples connected linear network cln process to groundwater flow gwf process which was introduced in modflow 2005 to analyze and simulate the influence of karst conduits and multi node wells hence this version can help modelers to gain a deeper understanding about karst systems and conduit networks panday et al 2013 moreover for the purpose of generating layered quadtree grids that can be used in modflow usg or other similar numerical models a new computer program gridgen was developed by lien et al in 2015 after reading a 3 d base grid gridgen continues dividing into refinement features which has already been provided by user until reaching the desired refinement level after finishing the process of gridding a tree structure file will be created and can be used in numerical models such as modflow usg this model was used for assessing the biscayne aquifer in southern florida in which karst aquifers are abundant lien et al 2014 developing a newton raphson formulation for modflow 2005 for offering an enhanced solution for problems related to groundwater flow in unconfined aquifers modflow nwt has been introduced and developed by niswonger et al 2011 its main application in addition to surface water routing hughes et al 2012 and seawater intrusion bakker et al 2013 can be described as its ability to solve problems that are coupled with drying and rewetting nonlinearities in equations that govern groundwater flow in unconfined aquifers a recently developed model similar to modflow but with a wider range of applicability in describing hydrological systems is rainfall response aquifer and watershed flow model rrawflow this lumped parameter model receives hydrological inputs such as rainfall recharge and discharge etc and is able to simulate groundwater level streamflow and spring flow it also can be used for modeling solute transport in aquifers and assessing system response to hydrological events long 2015 for classification of karst aquifers and characterizing time variant systems long and mahler developed and used this model in 2013 this model was used to predict and classify hydraulic responses to recharge in two karst aquifers in texas and south dakota usa long and mahler 2013 usually groundwater flow and contaminant transport models are used simultaneously using software platforms such as gms several researchers have done flow and transport analysis e g using modflow and mt3d and have achieved accurate and valid results abdalla and khalaf 2015 bora and borah 2016 also few scientists have studied the groundwater flow and contaminant transport in karstic aquifer of northern puerto rico using gms and their modeling results show its capability in analyzing and describing hydrological systems with complex properties such as high level of heterogeneity and anisotropy ghasemizadeh 2015 ghasemizadeh et al 2016 maihemuti et al 2015 table 2 elaborates the characteristics and application of aforementioned most commonly used groundwater modeling codes 4 4 equivalent porous media epm method several approaches have been followed to achieve accurate and valid results with acceptable efficiency at the same time for some cases simulation of groundwater hydraulic and contaminant transport in karst aquifers has been carried out by employing equivalent porous media epm method scanlon et al 2003 basically using epm approach for modeling a karst aquifer means considering simplifying assumptions in order to make the model more practical and applicable ghasemizadeh et al developed their model based in epm approach and found out that its result is acceptable for predicting water table fluctuations although their epm based model was not expected to be accurate enough for contaminant transport they found good agreement between their model output and actual data regarding spreading tce contaminant ghasemizadeh et al 2015 furthermore in another study by employing drainage features in regional groundwater flow modeling in karstic aquifer of northern puerto rico ghasemizadeh et al asserted that they were able to improve their simulation by assigning arrays of adjacent model cells with drains to simulate conduits they suggested that using this feature can be truly helpful especially when there is not sufficient data for conduit characteristics similarly maihemuti et al developed a modflow model using epm approach for assessing karst aquifer system and groundwater resources for a case study location in northern puerto rico their model was supposed to predict the karst system response to rainfall events and high pumping demands and also to describe the hydrological behavior of the existing aquifer they concluded that although there is high potential of conduit dominated flow the result of their epm based approach is reliable in representing the hydrodynamics of the karst aquifer in their case study location maihemuti et al 2015 4 5 how remote sensing can improve karst gw modeling remote sensing tools either coupled with modeling methods or be used separate can be very beneficial because of their strong data analysis and management capability which allows assessment of several datasets and layers simultaneously however lack of high resolution data for local studies can be problematic in some cases manda and gross 2006 theilen willige et al 2014 using geographic information system gis as a tool in groundwater modeling procedure can be truly helpful because all parameters such as distribution of rainfall groundwater recharge and discharge and also land cover are defined within a spatial context singh and fiorentino 1996 several researchers have took advantage of this powerful tool directly or as a parallel method in integrated approaches dar et al 2010 nampak et al 2014 alonso contes 2011 used remote sensing and advanced digital image processing techniques to delineate karst features which can enhance the understanding with regard to hydrogeology of the tanamá river and rio grande de arecibo catchments located in the north coast tertiary basin of puerto rico basically remote sensing tools have assisted the author in lineament mapping for gw exploration also manda and gross have employed gis analysis to characterize solution conduits in karstic areas based on their study they have shown that gis based methods can be used for determining depths dimensions shapes apertures and connectivity of potential conduits and also for describing physical characteristics that have an effect on the groundwater flow in karst aquifers manda and gross 2006 in addition theilen willige et al employed gis and remote sensing methods by analyzing satellite data in order to detect of near surface faults and fracture zones that can lead to dissolution processes in conduits of karst aquifers theilen willige et al 2014 numerous researchers have taken advantage of remote sensing techniques to improve their models and solve some un answered and complex problems by increasing the accuracy of prediction and also by taking into account other hydrological phenomena ashraf and ahmad 2012 machiwal et al 2012 thakur et al 2016 xu et al 2011 table 3 elaborates the potential application of gis and remote sensing in different phases of integrated groundwater modeling 5 conclusion it is vital to employ a comprehensive and efficient approach for managing water resources in regions where groundwater is the main source of water supply and vulnerable to contamination e g karst aquifers limestone karstic aquifer systems of northern puerto rico has been experiencing high level of contamination resulting in accelerating rate of preterm births in the island in addition to other human health related disorders several wells and sites were listed as the national priority list npl superfund sites and remediation action for treating water in these sites are ongoing by considering this island as a case study location and also by focusing on karst aquifers as the most complicated and hard to analyze forms of aquifers a review study was presented to qualitatively and quantitatively assess groundwater resources after an explanation of karst systems and their associated study methods in addition to surface water and gw interaction swgwi a brief review discussion on groundwater contamination and risk assessment was presented potential contamination threats in karst aquifers were discussed and different remediation techniques were evaluated furthermore a comprehensive discussion on existing groundwater modeling methods with regard to their application advantages and disadvantages was presented mostly numerical modeling approaches are taken by modelers to simulate complex groundwater systems numerical modeling tools often take advantage of finite difference and finite element techniques to solve complicated equations that governs hydrological system dynamics in an aquifer for karst aquifers lumped models and spatially distributed models are considered as two general modeling approaches that can be used in certain conditions in addition various computer based models such as modflow have been explained and evaluated a combined set of models can be used to simulate groundwater flow and contaminant transport either in steady state or transient form additionally application of remote sensing and gis in assessing water resources in karst and also for modeling purposes was explained overall it can be asserted that karst aquifers have the most complex behavior compared to other aquifer types because of their high level of permeability they are always prone to contamination hence employing different methods for studying karst aquifer and their inter relationship with surface water and ground surface may lead to different level of accuracy using integrated techniques by taking advantage of different methods for a case study and collecting sufficient data is costly but will greatly enhance the understanding and investigation of a certain karst aquifer such integrated techniques and data collection processes are recommended for north coast karst aquifer of puerto rico where the human health and ecosystem are at high risk from sustainable development perspective environmental economic and social impacts are consequences of water pollution in any region of the world hence careful attention should be paid to preserve water resources acknowledgements this work was supported by the us national institute of environmental

12273,karst aquifers capable of storing and transmitting large amount of water are the main source of drinking water in many regions worldwide their excessive permeability leads to an enhanced vulnerability to retain and spread the contamination accordingly from sustainability perspective the environmental economic and social impacts of karst contamination on water resources management are gaining more attention in this study an overview of hydrogeological processes and concepts regarding groundwater flow and contaminant transport in karstic systems is presented followed by a short discussion on surface water and groundwater interaction due to the complexity of karstic systems different approaches have been developed by researchers for investigating and understanding hydrogeological processes and groundwater behavior in karst which are reviewed herein additionally groundwater contamination issues and the most common and effective remediation techniques in karstic terrains are discussed lastly modeling techniques and remote sensing methods as beneficial and powerful tools for assessing groundwater flow and contaminant transport in karst terrains are reviewed and evaluated in each section relevant research works conducted for puerto rico are discussed and some recommendations are presented to complement the ongoing hydrogeological investigations on this island graphical abstract fx1 keywords groundwater karst remediation hydrogeology modeling puerto rico 1 introduction sustainable water resources management is a crucial concern in most countries across the globe only 3 of total water on the earth is considered as fresh water resources and approximately 30 of that is accessible as groundwater which is vital for human health ecosystem energy industry and other water dependent topics shiklomanov 1993 karst aquifers are responsible for providing potable water for 40 and 25 of the us and world s population respectively ghasemizadeh et al 2012 the increasing demand by residential industrial and agricultural uses have caused groundwater depletion and decreased quality in many regions from sustainable development perspective environmental economic and social impacts are consequences of water pollution in any region of the world hence careful attention should be paid to preserve water resources with particular reference to karst aquifers this study provides a comprehensive review of hydrological concepts and novel investigation and modeling techniques followed by a discussion of groundwater contamination and remediation techniques this paper aims to present and review the work of other researchers in the recent years especially after 2010 and to discuss the latest improvements that have been made regarding groundwater quality and quantity assessment in each section the associated research work that has been done for puerto rico is presented to better understand what research works have been conducted and what are the research gaps on karst aquifers of this island puerto rico as the case study location is considered a territory of the united states us the island is located in northeastern side of caribbean sea and have an estimated population of 3 6 million castro prieto et al 2017 several surface water and groundwater resources across the island provide residents with fresh water and are used for agricultural industrial and energy based purposes fig 1 exhibits the geographical location of puerto rico generalized geological setting of the island surficial geological formation of north coast limestone aquifer and cross sectional view of geological layers along the north coast due to the presence of karstic aquifers with high level of heterogeneity and anisotropy in northern coast of the island water from precipitation can rapidly percolate into underground this rapid movement makes karst aquifer highly vulnerable to emerging contamination from several sources of contamination induced by agricultural and industrial activities in addition to proximity to urban areas cherry 2001 moreover highly heterogeneous karstic aquifers with a lot of conduits cause high rate of water level fluctuation even in small temporal scaling yu et al assessed the patterns of temporal scaling of groundwater level fluctuation for the karstic aquifer of puerto rico and pointed out that according to multifractal or singularity spectrums there are smoother fluctuations in the alluvial aquifer and rougher ones in the northern karst aquifer yu et al 2016 2 karst aquifers 2 1 characterization comprising of chemically soluble rocks with large passages or network of conduits and caves inside karst aquifers are very permeable and capable of storing and transmitting large amount of water therefore karst regions have great potential of providing habitants with fresh water quinn et al 2006 in fact 20 25 of the world s population depends on water supplies from karst aquifer directly or indirectly approximately 10 of the world s land surface areas have karst aquifer beneath them this percentage is higher in some areas such as in europe where it is roughly 35 ford and williams 2007 until recent years the boundaries of karst aquifers around the world were not recognized accurately hence by taking advantage of gis tools recent exploration of karst aquifers and global lithological map that was developed before chen et al completed the first world karst aquifer map wokam their map distinguishes continuous carbonate rocks and discontinuous carbonate rocks and include major karst springs wells and caves chen et al 2017 many other resources show karst map of the us or the world distribution of karst aquifers within the united states and its territories based on usgs data is presented herein fig 2 detailed geological investigations in puerto rico show that limestone dolomite gypsum and anhydrite are the most common materials forming puerto rican karst aquifers fig 1 karst aquifers are individually different with unique work frame and characteristics and they should be studied case by case stevanović 2015 two important characteristics of karst aquifers are heterogeneity and anisotropy which make it hard for hydrogeologists and researchers to develop models using simplifying assumptions karsts have the most complex system amongst terrains causing lot of uncertainties and errors in developed models for studying and predicting their behavior bakalowicz 2005 also the recharge and discharge rate of karst springs can vary a lot due to several reasons such as fluctuations in water table level caused by hydrological events or seasonal variations gárfias soliz et al 2009 table 1 elaborates hydrogeological characteristics of three main aquifer types porous media fractured rock and karst system based on astm d 5717 95 standard astm 1995 a karst aquifer system comprises several elements such as caves conduits sinkholes and springs limestone karst aquifers are common in many areas around the world including puerto rico cherry 2001 rafael et al 2016 florida xu et al 2016 mexico bauer gottwein et al 2011 and china luo et al 2016 karsts usually are evolved from fractured or fractured porous rock networks after several years through carbonate dissolution creating large passages and caves several modeling methods have been employed to simulate the evolution of karst aquifers from fractured or porous fractured rock systems kaufmann 2003 2016 kiraly 2003 2 2 hydraulic conductivity in groundwater hydrology hydraulic conductivity quantifies the ability of soil in transferring water based upon various aquifer materials hydraulic conductivity can range from 10 cm s for gravel to 10 10 cm s 1 for shale hydraulic conductivity of karst limestone is the greatest comparing to many other aquifer types fig 3 laboratory field and numerical methods are 3 main means of measuring hydraulic conductivity numerical and finite element based methods are used for determining vertical and horizontal hydraulic conductivities kalbus et al 2006 smith et al 2016 usually in karst aquifers where subsurface heterogeneity exists determining hydraulic parameters such as k requires a complicated analysis because this parameter is spatially and temporally variable throughout the aquifer hydraulic tomography is a novel method that can be used for imaging the heterogeneity in karstic terrains illman et al 2007 moreover in karst aquifers the average range of k can vary depending on several factors such as geology slope level of heterogeneity and karstification angulo et al 2011 studied hydraulic conductivity in karst areas by applying water injection tests and electrical resistivity logging similarly different researchers reported experimental values for hydraulic conductivity based on their research approach and case study area chen et al 2011 fu et al 2015 sudicky et al 2010 as it is shown in fig 3 k of limestone karst aquifer which is dominant in northern coast of puerto rico can be assumed in the range of 10 4 5 cm s 1 which demonstrates high level of permeability in karst aquifers the estimated values of k in different locations of north coast karst aquifer of puerto rico can be found in the water resources investigation reports rodriguez martinez 1995 or similar sources for fine scale studies or modeling purposes 2 3 what methods can be used to study karst aquifers based on the aforementioned complex characteristics of karst several techniques and tools associated with modified and reformed conventional methods such as hydrologic and hydraulic methods geophysical and geological methods modeling techniques and tracer tests have been employed by researchers for understanding the behavior of karst aquifers goldscheider and drew 2007 stevanović 2015 giudici et al 2012 and hu et al 2009 studied karst aquifers by taking advantage of modeling methods in addition taking advantage of geological methods which help understanding the aquifer geometry and hydraulic properties such as permeability in addition to orientation and characteristics of potential flow paths can boost the accuracy of modeling results goldscheider and drew 2007 geophysical techniques can also be employed in conjunction with geological methods to understand geologic structures and overburden thickness of the aquifer chalikakis et al 2011 ford and williams 2007 goldscheider and drew 2007 2 4 surface water and groundwater interaction swgwi in karst interaction of surface water sw and groundwater gw plays a critical role in understanding hydrological behavior of a basin this interconnectivity incorporates the topographical geological and morphological characteristics of terrains generally water recharge from inflow of gw into the riverbed water discharge from river bed to aquifer and also losing and gaining water for both sw and gw in some river segments are three main processes that can occur in swgwi winter et al 1998 high permeability and low attenuation capacity of karst aquifers make mixture of sw and gw problematic for fresh water use in karst terrains rainfall infiltration and streamflow response to base flow discharge are separated by a much shorter delay in karst compared to other aquifer types bayless et al 2014 due to the complex patterns of sw and gw flow in karst several studies have denied coincide of sw and gw drainage divides a river that disappears in a sw basin and reappears in another basin can be mentioned as an example which depicts uncertainties in understanding the source of water and its associated dissolved contaminants in karst winter et al 1998 usually carbonate rocks are present at the land surface in karstic terrains however in some cases the bedrock is covered by other deposits e g surficial deposits which is called mantled karst e g edwards aquifer in south central texas in mantled karst shallow gw has interaction with lakes and wetlands in a way similar to that in sandy glacial and dune terrains the small difference in interaction of these two can be tied with the buried carbonate rocks dissolution of buried carbonate rocks can lead to slumpage of an overlying confining bed allowing water to flow readily through the confining bed consequently changes in hydraulic heads within the aquifers underlying the confining bed can affect the lakes and wetlands winter et al 1998 in addition to south central texas mantled karst can be found in north central florida this area has several sinkhole lakes and unconsolidated deposits overlie the highly soluble limestone of the upper floridan aquifer when unconsolidated surficial deposits slump into sinkholes which form in the underlying limestone most land surface depressions containing lakes are made hence in most of the times sinkholes in the bedrock underlying lakes affect the hydrology of the lakes although the lakes are not located directly within limestone winter et al 1998 the general term surface water can be referred to wastewater on the ground brackish water of the sea ocean and water in lakes and rivers attempts have been made to minimize the interaction between polluted sw and gw in karstic areas by placing an impermeable seal along canal bottoms or riverbeds constructing small dams weirs building grouting curtains changing the flow direction of surface waters plunging ponors and creating reactive barriers by pumping freshwater into aquifer milanović et al 2015 modeling hydrographic analysis and hydrogeological mapping are among common desktop techniques which are used to assess swgwi in karst fleckenstein et al 2010 hydrographic analysis which monitors stream flow time series and define base flow component can be used easier compared to the other two methods however it is only applicable for gaining stream conditions hence it may not give accurate result if used for a karst aquifer hydrogeological mapping method which provides comprehensive understanding of gw systems around streams and their related hydrogeological systems can describe hydrogeological components of a gw system at a course scale gleeson et al 2014 thus it can be used for regional assessment of karst aquifers in addition modeling methods can simulate water flow and contaminant transport around streams and within aquifer using mathematical equations although they can predict the behavior of a hydrogeological system their application in karst is limited usually simplifying assumptions are made during modeling process of swgwi in karst which result in uncertainties however by taking advantage of new techniques technologies and or by combing this method with other in situ measurements researchers have shown the application and promising future of modeling methods guay et al 2013 also field observations seepage measurement hydrochemical methods such as environmental isotopes hydrochemistry tracers and also hydrometric and geophysical analysis are beneficial field tools which can be used for describing swgwi in karst gonzález pinzón et al 2015 martinez et al 2015 in the recent years use of methods associated with geophysics e g resistivity em radiometrics or remote sensing e g landsat has been reported for mapping landscape features that indicate or control connectivity meyerhoff et al 2013 however because these methods require specific equipment technical expertise and logistical support researchers have had tendency to use more practical and easy to use methods such as hydrometrics and water budgets analysis brodie et al 2007 sometimes because of unknown and complex catchment boundaries analyzing water budgets can also be problematic goldscheider and drew 2007 hartmann et al 2014 kovács et al 2005 among field tools tracers have been widely used due to their capability of providing independent ways of validating or refuting conventional traditional methods of analyzing data and describing swgwi baskaran et al 2009 jankowski 2007 by using tracers such as florescent dyes aquifer parameters such as recharge and discharge and fluid transport properties can be determined martinez et al 2015 however tracer studies require careful planning e g meeting environmental regulatory controls and dosage control in many cases isotropic techniques and artificial tracers are used for determining residence time and water age and for understanding the water movement through conduits the main advantages of these techniques are determining linear flow velocities and information on contaminant transport and delineating catchment areas although obtained information and data from tracers are often reliable and unequivocal limited applicability in large areas with long transit times and also change of color and toxicity concerns are some of the disadvantages of using isotropic techniques and artificial tracers goldscheider et al 2008 jones and banner 2003 morales et al 2017 reviewing the literature it seems like the use of tracers has been more frequent and beneficial for understanding the interconnectivity between sw and gw in karst terrains compared to other field methods katz et al 1997 for example evaluating the connection between sinking streams and down gradient springs it should also be noted that temperature change analysis and water budget assessment can be coupled with other methods to achieve more accurate and validate results brodie et al 2007 due to complexity of karst s behavior different types of integrated techniques and or less common approaches have been employed by researchers to evaluate their performance in describing the interconnectivity between sw and karst gw brian katz et al 1997 chu et al 2016 loáiciga 2001 rugel et al 2016 sutton and screaton described swgwi of a karst aquifer basin in florida by analyzing river discharge and a transient numerical gw flow modeling their modeling results highlight the prominence of spatiotemporal variations in head gradients that can affect streams and karst aquifers connections and aquifer martial dissolution sutton et al 2014 bailly comte et al studied the hydrodynamic interactions between gw and surface water in a karst watershed in southern france their focus was on the effect of gw on the genesis and propagation of surface floods they showed the role of initial water level in a karst aquifer in predicting the type of hydraulic connection between sw and gw during flood events bailly comte et al 2009 moreover the analysis of sw and karst gw interaction conducted by bayless et al 2014 showed that analytical methods such as hydrograph separation and hysteretic loops can be used for identifying bounding conditions within the watershed chu et al studied swgwi in a karst aquifer in china using gw levels data and hydrochemistry analyses together with isotope data based on hydrogeological field investigations their cross correlation analysis showed that precipitation results in increasing gw level with a 2 month lag time moreover their spectral analysis depicted the possible inter connectivity between gw level gw exploitation and precipitation chu et al 2016 rugel et al conducted longitudinal sampling on a creek in georgia usa they realized there are stepwise gw inputs from the upper floridan aquifer in addition to specific conductance increase at 5 out of 50 sampled reaches the results of sampling along the 50 km study river section revealed that 42 of total gw inputs entered through discrete preferential flow pathways were located within these 5 sampling locations rugel et al 2016 in north coast limestone aquifer of puerto rico with presence of rivers and lagoons and occurring intense precipitation and seawater intrusion swgwi can have a major impact in the quality of fresh water within karst aquifers of the region however we failed in our attempts to find any detailed research works associated with swgwi in karst aquifers of northern pr hence collecting field data doing research and developing models to fully understand the mechanism of swgwi in northern part of the island is strongly recommended despite the fact that numerous methods have been developed for describing sw gw interrelationship there are still uncertainties and lack of sufficient knowledge for fully understanding 1 the time lag between gw pumping and its influence on sw 2 relationship between gw pumping and river losses and 3 exact recharge and discharge points in streams jankowski 2007 wu et al assessed uncertainties in swgwi modeling employing a probabilistic collection method they evaluated the applicability of the frame work through an integrated sw gw model for a basin in china and asserted that in describing complex swgwis modeling uncertainties depend on the output and have significant spatiotemporal variability hence employing a systematic uncertainty analysis can be extremely helpful in understanding swgwi wu et al 2014 and also in groundwater model development process of karst aquifers engelhardt et al 2014 3 groundwater contamination and remediation techniques karst aquifers which are portrayed as high permeable soil rock systems with caves and fractures inside and also recharged by sinkholes and rivers have shown high vulnerability to contamination kačaroğlu 1999 the formation of solution channels and sinkholes facilitates the intrusion of seawater and contaminated storm water and wastewater into the aquifer this is the main reason of accelerating the spread of contaminants in karst more than other aquifer types i e porous media and fractured rock basically fate and transport processes are not only different for each contaminant depending on the physical and chemical properties of the contaminant but also are particularly different in karst compared to other aquifers a few studies assessed historical gw contamination in north coast limestone karst aquifer of puerto rico and suggested beneficial remedial actions and water resources management approaches biaggi 1995 padilla et al 2011 3 1 contaminant types and sources of contamination agricultural industrial residential commercial and municipal development are considered as the main sources of groundwater pollution in recent decades fetter 2001 wakida and lerner 2005 in particular leakage of storage tanks chemical spills landfills fertilizers and pesticides sanitation systems untreated waste discharge and sewage are some of the main sources of contamination due to anthropogenic activities el alfy and faraj 2017 generally regardless of the source of contamination pathogens organic compounds lapworth et al 2012 metals yao et al 2012 and other inorganic compounds e g nitrates chlorides are often found in groundwater panagiotakis and dermatas 2017 vidal montes et al 2016 the most commonly found contaminants in karst gw are presented below 3 1 1 nitrate nitrate is one of the most common gw contaminants according to several studies almasri and kaluarachchi 2004 babiker 2004 point sources of nitrogen nitrate leachate such as old septic systems landfills wastewater holding ponds and leaks from cracks in sewer pipelines can cause gw nitrate contamination almasri 2007 kendall and aravena 2000 wakida and lerner 2005 additionally non point sources of n leaching such as fertilizer use in agricultural areas play a very significant role in increasing gw nitrate contamination in a usgs report with focus on manati and vega baja municipalities in puerto rico nitrate occurrence and contamination were assessed it was identified that the major sources of nitrate contamination in the karst aquifer of the region are use of fertilizers for cultivation of pineapples and also septic tank effluent in rural and un sewered no sewer system areas conde costas and gómez gómez 1999 3 1 2 ppcp nowadays treating water contaminated by new chemical compounds mainly originated from pharmaceutical and personal care products ppcp are a big concern metcalfe et al 2011 concentration of ppcps such as antibiotics anti inflammatories lipid regulators psychiatric drugs stimulants insect repellants and sunscreen agents is higher than regulatory criterion in many areas usually wastewater and contaminated surface water landfills septic systems and sewer leakages are considered as common sources of ppcp contamination especially in karstic areas dodgen et al 2017 sui et al 2015 high concentration of ppcps in karst aquifers of switzerland and jordan was reported by morasch 2013 and zemann et al 2015 respectively moreover dodgen et al assessed ppcp concentration in karst aquifers of southwestern illinois in the usa and found out that no single water quality or meteorological parameter was significantly associated with ppcp contamination across all site profiles they mentioned septic tanks effluent as a probable source of ppcps dodgen et al 2017 in another study it was realized that due to high transmissivity of the shallow alluvium the gw below alluvial deposits is subjected to pollution caused by ppcp residues from wastewater effluents through artificial aquifer recharge sui et al 2015 no studies related to ppcp contamination of gw in pr were found however it is expected that due to large number of septic tanks and poor effectiveness of wastewater treatment plants to deal with ppcps in addition to use of mosquito repellent creams because of zika virus groundwater quality will be affected by ppcp contamination in the island hennessey et al 2016 3 1 3 metals in carbonated water of the karst aquifer at natural ph heavy metals such as cr ni pb and cd often precipitate as hydroxides and carbonates heavy metal transport as an episodic phenomenon mostly occurs when metals are adsorbed onto small particles of soil when hydraulic condition of gw flow facilitates suspension of small particles heavy metals can migrate down the flow path vesper et al 2003 also elevated concentration of metalloids such as arsenic has raised concerns in many regions heavy metals and metalloids in groundwater can be present in areas where there are mining operations or mine waste dumps industrial activities and urban waste are known as possible sources of metal loid s leachate in karstic gw alloway 2013 additionally urban surface runoff containing high concentration of metals goes through karst aquifers via sinkholes and conduit network bonneau et al 2017 heavy metal ions are also frequently leached naturally from rocks and soils within karst media and can be introduced with acidic deposition drew and hötzl 1999 in karst gw of puerto rico high concentration of metals mainly arsenic lead and total chromium have also been detected mainly at superfund sites fig 4 usepa 2003 3 1 4 lnapl and dnapl light non aqueous phase liquids lnapls have tendency to float on the surface of groundwater table they are usually present behind obstructions in cave streams within karst aquifers unlike lnapls dense non aqueous phase liquids dnapls sink to the bottom of the aquifer and have tendency to be stored in lower points of the bottom of conduits moreover it was reported that they tend to concentrate in open conduits ghasemizadeh et al 2012 lnapl and dnapl transport in karst aquifers is contingent upon runoff and gw flow hydraulics lnapls can be forced into the karst system as plug flow and dnapls can be mobilized by transporting sediments at the bottom layer in contrast to dissolved contaminants the transport of napls in aquifers is strongly influenced by buoyancy effects and surface tension properties this makes the transport behavior of napls less directly related to groundwater flow and more difficult to predict vesper et al 2003 by conducting transport experiments using non aqueous phase tce in a laboratory scale karst limestone rock carmona de jesús and padilla showed that although dnapls prefer to move downward they can also move along non vertical conduits when subjected to gw flow fields furthermore it was demonstrated that once dnapls penetrate preferential flow pathways subsequent injections often follow the same route when they reach limited flow areas dnapls will be accumulated and transported through diffusive processes after dissolution carmona de jesús and padilla 2015 3 1 5 volatile organic compounds voc volatile and semi volatile organic compounds vocs and svocs respectively flow along with the subsurface waters in karst but their volatility results in migrating the vapor phases of these contaminants through the vadose zone field 2017 a few studies assessed the contamination of chlorinated volatile organic compounds cvoc in pr padilla et al 2011 rivera et al 2017 historical studies since 1980 show that mainly contaminants with chlorinated solvents including tce dichloroethene chloroform carbon tetrachloride tetrachloroethene tetrachloroethane dichloroethane and methylene chloride have high concentrations causing public health concerns padilla et al 2011 several wells and sites fig 4 were considered as the national priority list npl superfund sites and remediation actions for treating water in these sites begun years ago yu et al 2015 regarding studying the groundwater pollution and understanding the potential exposure pathways of contaminants some methods such as using tracers and gis has been employed by researchers steele valentín and padilla 2009 the abundancy of superfund sites and high concentration of contaminants in gw recourses of puerto rico are suspected to be responsible for increasing rate of pre term birth highest amongst us states and territories in the island mathews and macdorman 2011 however since 2006 this rate has been declined from 20 to 11 4 due to remediation actions and enhanced awareness of habitant regarding water borne diseases march of dimes website 2016 rutigliano 2016 as it appears in fig 4 there is abundance of superfund sites in npr mainly due to industrial activities improper management of landfills accidental spills unidentified waste disposals or residential septic systems most of these sites are located in upper aquifer of north coast limestone aquifer system on the border of arecibo and barceloneta there are 3 superfund sites which indicated high level of contamination in groundwater of that area in karst aquifers of pr analysis of contaminant transport requires more sophisticated approaches coupled with continuous field assessments and data collection hu et al 2009 yu et al assessed the concentration of cvocs such as trichloroethylene tce perchloroethene pce carbon tetrachloride ct chloroform or trichloromethane tcm and methylene chloride dcm in northern puerto rico based on historical data they stated that the hydrogeological conditions of the karst aquifer intrinsic properties and the biological environment in addition to the source origin were greatly associated with the spatiotemporal distribution patterns of the cvocs since water resources pollution in northern puerto rico has caused a negative social economic and environmental impact long term consistent monitoring of water quality in addition to implementation of remedial actions were suggested yu et al 2015 3 1 6 pathogens pathogens such as viruses and bacteria are easily transported in karstic systems this is because of high drainage potential of karst and lack of soil layers which can act as filters hence pathogens retain their activity in karst conduits for a long time vesper et al 2003 fecal coliforms fecal streptococci and often a particular emphasis on escherichia coli have been studied more compared to viruses in karst aquifers these organisms often indicate gw contamination caused by sewage or animal waste studies regarding bacterial contamination in west virginia mathes 2000 ontario conboy and goss 2000 and western ireland thorn and coxon 1992 show the presence of fecal bacteria in carbonate wells white 2016 muldoon et al 2016 assessed sources of fecal contamination in the silurian dolomite aquifer of wisconsin using enteric pathogens moreover it was found out that high percentage of bacteria travels within karst media by adsorbing on small particulates mostly clay mahler et al 2000 white 2016 resources for assessment of pathogens in karst aquifers of puerto rico are scarce by assessing the north karst belt zone of puerto rico acosta colón suggested that mesofauna diversity can be a possible indicator of pathogenic and opportunistic species it was also recommended that in addition to characterizing mesofauna and species more knowledge about the diet of mesofauna organisms is needed to clearly identify species that can be used as indicators of cave microbial pathogens acosta colón 2016 3 1 7 chloride coastal aquifers such as north coast limestone aquifer of puerto rico are susceptible to seawater intrusion which can increase the salinity chloride concentration of groundwater arfib et al 2007 mongelli et al 2013 having a hydraulic connection to the sea karstic coastal aquifers can be characterized by having groundwater flow in conduits sub marine freshwater springs and intrusion of seawater through the aquifer via conduit networks fleury et al 2007 due to susceptibility of karstic coastal aquifers developing a sustainable plan by using integrated models for managing and monitoring water resources within these aquifers is essential sreekanth and datta 2015 same as pathogens not much research has been conducted regarding seawater intrusion in coastal karst aquifer of puerto rico although zack et al stated that the freshwater saltwater interface of the north coast limestone aquifer of pr is probably seaward and freshwater discharges to the seabed by extracting water from public supply wells which results in decreasing gw level seawater intrusion can be a potential problem in npr zack et al 1987 not much chloride concentration data is available within usgs database and other resources hence conducting a field sampling for a few years is recommended to assess the potential risk of chloride based gw contamination 3 2 remediation strategies in karst aquifers based on increased understanding of contaminant transport behaviors and efficacies of various remediation technologies usepa emphasizes that combination of source and dissolved phase plume remediation is preferable strategy for remediation of many sites usepa 2013 however in addition to the challenges in costs and the extend of the treatment efficiencies arising at different sites remediation in karst is even more challenging than in other hydrogological environments due to the presence of highly permeable conduits of unknown extent parise et al 2015 fig 5 for example sinreich 2014 stated that at the field scale selecting the specific remediation technique for each contaminant requires comparative tracing experiments using contaminant surrogates in spite of the dominant preferential flow pathways solute and colloid tracers interact with aquifer material hence if reactive and or non persistent contaminants are present in conduits hydro chemical properties of contaminants are more important than aquifer intrinsic vulnerability in the transport process and arrival of contaminants at karst springs most remediation processes in karst have lower efficiency compared to other aquifer types because of their time dependent characteristics sinreich 2014 also suggested that the assumption of high vulnerability of karst may not be true for all conditions and should be identified based on fate and transport of specific contaminants thus no preference should be considered for karst gw treatment methods because they can have different efficiency and cost based on contaminant properties and site condition another example related to pump and treat application field 2017 confirmed varying levels of success due to extreme heterogeneity and anisotropy of karst limited diameter length of the conduits and the behavior of flow regime within the solution conduits it was realized that pump and treat was barely used by agencies for remediating contaminated karst gw usepa 2013 as concluded by parise et al 2015 main difficulties with achieving feasible plume containment in karst with pump and treat systems are finding all preferential flow paths of the dissolved contaminant to the points of compliance and hydraulically stopping this transport by pumping both contaminated and clean water due to all these challenges it was pointed out that contaminated karst aquifers tend to fall under the special category of technical impracticability ti waivers this means regardless of how much effort and financial resources are expended actual remediation cannot be accomplished because of technical implausibility especially for aquifers contaminated by dnapls field 2017 usepa 2012 it was found that most of the case studies associated with ti waivers were those in karstic hydrogeological setting deeb et al 2011 however in situ thermal treatment in situ chemical oxidation and in situ bioremediation are increasingly being applied at fractured rock and karst site for source and plume remediation while point of use and point of entry has been evaluated and proposed strategy for karst groundwater treatment randrianarivelo et al 2017 3 2 1 source and plume remediation in situ thermal treatment in situ chemical oxidation isco and in situ bioremediation are the main in situ remediation methods which have commonly been used in karst aquifers with certain limitations beyke et al 2014 parise et al 2015 studies have shown that identifying the location of conduits and major fractures is necessary for an efficient remedial action it was reported that electrical resistance heating technique was successfully implemented for removing dnapls and tce in a karst aquifer in alabama but preferential pathways within karst aquifers leading to high seepage velocity can cause heat loss hodges et al 2014 the preferential flow pathways within karst system which can disperse injected materials usually are problematic for other treatment methods such as isco and bioremediation as well regarding in situ bioremediation hashim et al pointed out that biological or biochemical methods which use microbes and nutrients for bio precipitation enzymatic oxidations bio surfactants and sulfate reductions for removing heavy metals seems to be applicable and efficient in karst because injecting nutrients and electron donors is relatively inexpensive and non toxic hashim et al 2011 byl and williams stated that in areas isolated from the major groundwater flow paths low migration of contaminant may possible to allow biodegradation of chlorinated ethenes and fuel if favorable microorganisms food sources and geochemical conditions are present byl et al 2001 byl and williams 2000 the potential for biodegradation of chlorinated organic solvents was in a karst aquifer was confirmed at the tce contaminated site at lewisburg tennessee indicating that natural attenuation should not be disregarded byl et al 2002 also randrianarivelo et al conducted remedial investigations of a karst aquifer in pennsylvania they selected chemical oxidation in conjunction with monitored natural attenuation or land use control as preferred remediation method alternative based on the hydrogeological conditions of the site and the extent of the delineated contamination plumes randrianarivelo et al 2017 regarding isco remediation method by assuming that the contaminated area is well identified and the injection fluid has the right dosage and residence time the possibility of delivering injection fluid to the contaminated area with minimal error is the major challenge similar to other fluid based remediation methods in karst aquifers moreover for achieving the highest efficiency in treating contaminants diffused into the rock matrix or moving with slow advective transport oxidizing agents should remain in the contaminated area however rapid movement of water through preferential flow pathways dilutes the oxidizing agents thus it can be asserted that application of isco in karst aquifers is limited regardless of limitations in applying treatment methods for karst aquifers randrianarivelo et al 2017 pointed out chemical oxidation as a beneficial techniques for gw remediation the main challenge associated with these techniques is to identify the zone that requires treatment based on site conditions and the type of contaminants the most effective technology should be employed assessment of remediation technique requires an appropriate monitoring approach for locations consist of springs streams extraction systems and previously tested wells and comprehensive hydrogeological and water quality sampling data randrianarivelo et al 2017 3 2 2 remediation by mitigating exposure pathways exposure pathways often play a crucial role in spreading the contamination through karst aquifers steele valentín and padilla delineated the potential exposure pathway of contaminants in vega alta puerto rico the pathway starts from superfund sites and is directed toward atlantic ocean moreover it covers a noticeable lateral extension which impacts wells wetlands and streams in the area steele valentín and padilla 2009 because of interconnectivity between conduits and fractures within karst aquifer controlling exposure pathways is more difficult compared to other aquifer types however mitigating exposure pathways can be done by treating at the tap replacing drinking water supplies treating spring flow using active and passive methods land cover control using fences signage deed restriction and local law enforcement in spite of their high treatment capabilities these techniques often require long term operation and maintenance costs randrianarivelo et al 2017 one of the promising cost effective methods for minimizing the exposure pathways is electrochemical treatment environmentally friendly option of using solar power independent no other remedial actions needed and controllable with regard to the rates of redox reactions the high removal percentage for various contaminants in karst groundwater has been achieved in laboratory and pilot scale studies fallahpour 2016 gregor et al 2017 mao et al 2012 4 application of modeling in karst in order to predict the behavior aquifers based on hydrological variations groundwater models have been developed by hydrogeologists and water resources scientists in addition some models are developed to chemically analyze the water quality and to simulate fate and transport of contaminants a groundwater flow model is able to exhibit precise representation of hydrological and geological systems and also it can give a real insight into relationship and interactions between system elements modeling using computer programs can be truly beneficial when there are karst aquifers in the case study location this is mainly due to the fact that karst aquifers are very heterogeneous and anisotropic and have a complex structure ergo developing a relatively sophisticated model is the best option for simulating these types of aquifers 4 1 model parameters and development depending on the soil type and water table level the percolation rate regarding the movement of water from saturated zone to groundwater differs ritchey and rumbaugh 1996 additionally the impact of human interferences with natural water cycle which can be caused mostly by irrigation and pumping water from wells should be taken into account actually a groundwater model can determine how much it is perilous for an aquifer and also for the ecosystem if certain level of human interference exists this can help developing water resources management plans that can not only help optimizing water extraction but also can preserve the environment and natural resources drew and hötzl 1999 other physical parameters such as topographical and geological information of the region that is going to be modeled should be given to the modeling platform peterson and wicks 2006 anisotropy of aquifers regarding hydraulic conductivity which is a parameter that can have a dissimilar value in each direction can only be considered in two or three dimensional models nowadays by developing computer programs and also due to the need of acquiring more valid results as the output of modeling three dimensional models are more acceptable despite the possible complex procedure of setting them up anderson et al 2015 in fact while one dimensional models can be applied for vertical flow in multiple horizontal layers and two dimensional models considers water flow in a vertical plain and this is repeated in multiple parallel vertical plains as well a three dimensional model subdivides the flow region into smaller cells with possible different properties regarding aquifer condition soil characteristics and water flow ebrahim 2014 mostly numerical analysis and tools should be used to solve complex differential equations of groundwater flow in fact a groundwater flow model is able to represent conceptual model of an aquifer mathematically and this mathematical representation enables researchers to solve the governing equations numerically by computers ebrahim 2014 world meteorological organization 2009 using numerical solutions for solving groundwater flow equations in a three dimensional scale is beneficial for models which follow the flow domain discretization approach usually in a groundwater flow model hydraulic head at each cell center and groundwater flow rate between cells can be considered as outcomes moreover impacts on streamflow because of pumping or long term impacts of current pumping can be assessed checking the consistency of datasets and parameters and also defining e framework for future studies related to groundwater and aquifer condition are two prominent products of a groundwater model hartmann et al 2014 ritchey and rumbaugh 1996 researchers and hydrogeologists have tried to develop groundwater models which can predict and simulate the groundwater flow in the karst aquifers in a regional or local scale regional groundwater models are capable of optimizing groundwater resources development plans analyzing water budget of aquifers and assessing regional flow systems zhou and li 2011 published a review paper regarding regional groundwater modeling and discussed their characteristics and associates drawbacks sauter assessed the quantification and prediction of regional groundwater flow and transport in a karst aquifer in germany he discussed how the most appropriate modeling tool can be selected and how it can be used for simulation for a specific case study location by analyzing spring flow spatiotemporal variations of groundwater levels and hydraulic parameters the model was able to successfully describe the karst aquifer system in the studied location sauter 1992 fig 6 depicts the schematic diagram of the process of developing a groundwater model 4 2 spatially lumped models and distributed parameter models ghasemizadeh et al categorized groundwater models into different groups based on their capabilities and characteristics due to high level of heterogeneity and anisotropy in karst aquifers accurately understanding of their behavior and distribution has always been challenging this has forced modelers to employ approximate based approaches and consequently consider the impact of the uncertainties caused by these approaches in their models hence spatially lumped models slm and distributed models dm or spatiotemporal distributed models sdm were introduced as two general approaches in modeling karst aquifers ghasemizadeh et al 2012 world meteorological organization 2009 spatially lumped models comprises of concentrated elements at spatially singular points whereas the elements are spatially distributed in distributed models hence in distributed systems physical quantities are spatially and temporally dependent spatially lumped or global models do not consider spatial alternation of flow patterns and are supposed to simulate a global chemical hydrological response at the aquifer output point for example spring discharge point with regard to inputs of the aquifer e g rivers groundwater recharge points net runoff etc ghasemizadeh et al 2012 singh 2014 assessing temporal alternations is an approach that spatially lumped models take to describe the global water balance and hydrological behavior of an aquifer moreover in spatially lumped models some factors that cause complexity in calculations and simulating are neglected due to simplifying assumptions and hence using only the global parameters in simple ordinary linear differential equations and also low data requirements are some of their properties that can be considered when trying to select the best modeling approach for groundwater flow and transport simulation although these models cannot produce accurate results especially in karstic areas they have been widely used by researchers in the areas where less data is available or only the prediction of groundwater flow spring discharge and groundwater levels is necessary long 2015 panagopoulos 2012 hydrograph chemograph analysis dewandel et al 2003 linear storage models or rainfall discharge models butscher and huggenberger 2008 and soft computing techniques such as fuzzy logic mohd adnan et al 2013 rezaei et al 2013 genetic algorithm mckinney and lin 1994 nicklow et al 2010 and artificial neural network ann hu et al 2008 are three main approaches with regard to spatially lumped models that have been adopted by hydrological modelers in contrast distributed models take complex parameters involved in groundwater flow and transport into account in these models dependent hydrological parameters and boundary conditions can be spatiotemporally variable and this will require the equations to be solved numerically and based on partial differential equations asher et al 2015 kuniansky 2016 also due to the fact that all variables should be defied to the system collecting more data and paying careful attention to details in this type of modeling is demanded which can make it more challenging dong et al 2012 long and gilcrease 2009 for karst aquifer modeling different type of distributed models based on the level of simplified assumptions have been used each of the developed models and methods treats complexity of karst aquifer differently and simulates groundwater flow based on its own logic and assumptions equivalent porous medium epm double porosity or continuum method dpm discrete fracture network dfn discrete channel or conduit network dcn and hybrid models hm are five common modeling approaches in distributed systems that have their own characteristics which will be discussed shortly in the following ghasemizadeh et al 2012 dfn can be subcategorized into discrete singular fracture set approach dsfs and discrete multiple fracture set dmfs approaches sometimes epm and dpm are also mentioned as single continuum porous equivalent approach scpe and double continuum porous equivalent approach dcpe respectively in the literature it is worth mentioning that employing hybrid models which are the result of integrating discrete models and epm approach and are also called coupled continuum pipe flow models can be beneficial in many cases regarding modeling complex hydrological systems such as karst aquifers kiraly 1998 liedl et al 2003 fig 7 demonstrated schematic configuration of the aforementioned distributed modeling approaches bauer et al have developed a numerical model to describe the influence of exchange flow between conduits and fissured system they found out that under conditions of early karst evolution conduit development is faster hence exchange flow plays an important role in developing early karst evolution in limestone aquifers bauer et al 2003 also some researchers have employed numerical modeling approaches to describe groundwater flow and transport in rough fractures briggs et al 2014 and karst aquifers faulkner et al 2009 however modeling karst aquifers cannot only be carried out by numerical approaches barrett and charbeneau 1998 furthermore for simulating the genesis of karst aquifer systems a numerical couple reactive network model comprising of a 2d porous continuum flow module a discrete pipe network for modeling flow and transport in the conduits and a carbonate dissolution module was developed by clemens t et al 1997 4 3 computer models and programs modflow is the most common groundwater modeling code that has been used due to its capability of simulating complex groundwater flows in a three dimensional scale working based on finite difference method and block centered approach modflow simulates the groundwater within the aquifer by considering different type of layers underground i e confined unconfined or both and also different recharge or discharge sources such as areal recharge groundwater flow to wells runoff caused by rainfall flow to riverbeds spring flow etc harbaugh 2005 the initial version of modflow modflow 2000 was released in the year 2000 and five years later the updated version modflow 2005 started gaining attentions from groundwater modelers and hydrogeologists to enhance the application of modflow 2000 two models have been introduced by usgs which are vsf and mf2k gwt basically vsf is a version of modflow 2000 that in addition to the ability of modflow 2000 to model groundwater flow using a finite difference method in a 3 d scale can be applicable for variably saturated flow vsf thoms et al 2006 mf2k gwt is an integrated model with modflow 2000 that have the ability to simulate groundwater flow and solute transport u s geological survey website 2012 nevertheless some programs that were independent to modflow but developed by usgs were released as well such as hst3d 3 d heat and solute transport model that is able to simulate ground water flow and associated heat and solute transport in a 3d scale its capabilities can be used in analyzing problems associates with landfill leaching seawater intrusion hot water geothermal systems etc kipp 1997 the most updated version of modflow program modflow 6 was released recently in this program any number of models can be used for concurrent simulation these models can have inter connection with each other and this can help solving complex hydrogeological problems in many cases such as the conditions in karst aquifers also within this framework multiple local gw models can be coupled with regional scale models langevin et al 2017 moreover conduit flow package cfp which can be coupled with modflow 2005 can facilitate simulation of karstic geometry and gw movement and consequently increase the accuracy of gw flow modeling in conduits shoemaker et al 2007 after releasing modflow 2005 several associated models and packages were introduced and released based on numerous approaches and techniques as an example mt3d model which is a modular comprehensive numerical three dimensional solute transport model was developed by usgs this model has been designed to work very well regarding simulation of solute transport and reactive solute transport in complex hydrological systems being connected to modflow which is the usgs groundwater flow simulator mt3d is able to simulate and analyze advection dominated transport especially solute transport without refining new models bedekar et al 2016 lautz and siegel used mt3d and modflow to simulate groundwater and surface water mixing in the hyporheic zone they took advantage of this model due to its ability to simulate advective transport and source and sink mixing of solutes lautz and siegel 2006 taking advantage of the features in modflow and mt3d a new computer program seawat was released to assist hydrogeologists in simulating three dimensional variable density and transient groundwater flow that can be coupled with solute transport in the last version of seawat version 4 the effect of fluid viscosity and density fluctuations can be considered in simulation of groundwater flow and solute transport this will allow the users to recognize this model as a tool that can be used in a wide range of simulation practices including seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers langevin 2009 langevin et al 2008 xu employed seawat in his dissertation to study seawater intrusion into a coastal karstic aquifer in florida and achieved accurate results it is worth mentioning that seawater intrusion can be considered as a substantial source of brackish water in coastal aquifers such as karst aquifer in north coast of puerto rico xu 2016 in addition feflow finite element subsurface flow system is a finite element package for simulating 3d and 2d fluid density coupled flow contaminant mass salinity and heat transport in the subsurface it has several applications including regional groundwater management saltwater intrusion seepage through dams and levees land use and climate change scenarios groundwater remediation and natural attenuation and also groundwater surface water interaction as an example a study has been conducted to simulate groundwater dynamics in an irrigation and drainage network in uzbekistan using feflow after model calibration and validation the results show high level of accuracy and can be used for hydrogeological management plans diersch 2014 khalid awan et al 2015 sutra is another model that has been released for simulating 2 d saturated unsaturated fluid density dependent flow with energy transport or chemically reactive single species solute transport capable of analyzing saltwater intrusion and energy transport it uses a 2d hybrid finite element and integrated finite difference approach to approximate the governing flow and transport equations that explain the two interdependent processes it should be noted that the 3d version of this model has also been released recently in sutra s version 2 2 specification of time dependent boundary conditions can be identified without programming fortran code sutra can also describe chemical species transport including absorption production and decay processes and assess well performance and pumping test data voss and provost 2002 for instance hussain et al 2015 used sutra in their paper to study coastal aquifer systems that are subjected to seawater intrusion visual modflow flex platform an integrated modeling environment that connects modflow and mt3d is able to simulate complex 3d groundwater flow and contaminant transport its graphical user interface and 3d visualization capabilities in addition to its ability to simulate groundwater flow and contaminant transport can gain attention of hydrological and groundwater modelers as an example of work varghese et al successfully developed a visual modflow flex model for simulation of groundwater flow in a region in india kumar and singh 2015 varghese et al 2015 chemflo 2000 which is interactive software for simulating water and chemical movement in unsaturated soils enables users to simulate groundwater flow and chemical fate and transport in vadose zones the model can be used as a tool that can enhance the understanding of unsaturated flow and transport processes in this model water movement and chemical transport are modeled using the richards and the convection dispersion equations respectively the equations are solved numerically using the finite differences approach nofziger and wu 2003 another 3d finite element based model for simulating flow and transport is 3dfemfat this model works for saturated unsaturated heterogeneous and anisotropic media its typical applications include infiltration agriculture pesticides sanitary landfill hazardous waste disposal sites density induced flow and transport saltwater intrusion etc its flexibility and feasibility in simulating a wide range of practical problems especially by employing its transport module has made it valuable software for researchers and transport modelers also its application in studying seawater intrusion in coastal aquifer has been verified by some scientists lathashri and mahesha 2016 park et al 2012 regarding surface water and groundwater interaction which was discussed in the previous sections in detail gsflow groundwater and surface water flow was released by usgs in 2008 as an integrated tool that is able to couple groundwater and surface water flow models by taking advantage of the approaches used in usgs precipitation runoff modeling system prms and the usgs modular groundwater flow model modflow and modflow nwt meteorological and hydrological data such as rainfall sunny hours and temperature in addition to groundwater stresses and initial boundary conditions are involved as inputs for the process of simulation in this model gsflow can also take into account the impact of land cover change climate change and groundwater extraction on surface water and groundwater flow for spatiotemporally variable situations markstrom et al 2008 however regarding its limitations it was asserted by researchers that its ability to simulate surface water and groundwater in karst aquifers with high level of heterogeneity is not guaranteed fulton et al 2015 by taking advantage of a control volume finite difference method modflow usg un saturated grid version of modflow is able to simulate groundwater flow and its related processes this version of modflow supports different types of structured and unstructured grids this capability is extremely useful when high resolution along rivers and around wells is needed in addition modflow usg couples connected linear network cln process to groundwater flow gwf process which was introduced in modflow 2005 to analyze and simulate the influence of karst conduits and multi node wells hence this version can help modelers to gain a deeper understanding about karst systems and conduit networks panday et al 2013 moreover for the purpose of generating layered quadtree grids that can be used in modflow usg or other similar numerical models a new computer program gridgen was developed by lien et al in 2015 after reading a 3 d base grid gridgen continues dividing into refinement features which has already been provided by user until reaching the desired refinement level after finishing the process of gridding a tree structure file will be created and can be used in numerical models such as modflow usg this model was used for assessing the biscayne aquifer in southern florida in which karst aquifers are abundant lien et al 2014 developing a newton raphson formulation for modflow 2005 for offering an enhanced solution for problems related to groundwater flow in unconfined aquifers modflow nwt has been introduced and developed by niswonger et al 2011 its main application in addition to surface water routing hughes et al 2012 and seawater intrusion bakker et al 2013 can be described as its ability to solve problems that are coupled with drying and rewetting nonlinearities in equations that govern groundwater flow in unconfined aquifers a recently developed model similar to modflow but with a wider range of applicability in describing hydrological systems is rainfall response aquifer and watershed flow model rrawflow this lumped parameter model receives hydrological inputs such as rainfall recharge and discharge etc and is able to simulate groundwater level streamflow and spring flow it also can be used for modeling solute transport in aquifers and assessing system response to hydrological events long 2015 for classification of karst aquifers and characterizing time variant systems long and mahler developed and used this model in 2013 this model was used to predict and classify hydraulic responses to recharge in two karst aquifers in texas and south dakota usa long and mahler 2013 usually groundwater flow and contaminant transport models are used simultaneously using software platforms such as gms several researchers have done flow and transport analysis e g using modflow and mt3d and have achieved accurate and valid results abdalla and khalaf 2015 bora and borah 2016 also few scientists have studied the groundwater flow and contaminant transport in karstic aquifer of northern puerto rico using gms and their modeling results show its capability in analyzing and describing hydrological systems with complex properties such as high level of heterogeneity and anisotropy ghasemizadeh 2015 ghasemizadeh et al 2016 maihemuti et al 2015 table 2 elaborates the characteristics and application of aforementioned most commonly used groundwater modeling codes 4 4 equivalent porous media epm method several approaches have been followed to achieve accurate and valid results with acceptable efficiency at the same time for some cases simulation of groundwater hydraulic and contaminant transport in karst aquifers has been carried out by employing equivalent porous media epm method scanlon et al 2003 basically using epm approach for modeling a karst aquifer means considering simplifying assumptions in order to make the model more practical and applicable ghasemizadeh et al developed their model based in epm approach and found out that its result is acceptable for predicting water table fluctuations although their epm based model was not expected to be accurate enough for contaminant transport they found good agreement between their model output and actual data regarding spreading tce contaminant ghasemizadeh et al 2015 furthermore in another study by employing drainage features in regional groundwater flow modeling in karstic aquifer of northern puerto rico ghasemizadeh et al asserted that they were able to improve their simulation by assigning arrays of adjacent model cells with drains to simulate conduits they suggested that using this feature can be truly helpful especially when there is not sufficient data for conduit characteristics similarly maihemuti et al developed a modflow model using epm approach for assessing karst aquifer system and groundwater resources for a case study location in northern puerto rico their model was supposed to predict the karst system response to rainfall events and high pumping demands and also to describe the hydrological behavior of the existing aquifer they concluded that although there is high potential of conduit dominated flow the result of their epm based approach is reliable in representing the hydrodynamics of the karst aquifer in their case study location maihemuti et al 2015 4 5 how remote sensing can improve karst gw modeling remote sensing tools either coupled with modeling methods or be used separate can be very beneficial because of their strong data analysis and management capability which allows assessment of several datasets and layers simultaneously however lack of high resolution data for local studies can be problematic in some cases manda and gross 2006 theilen willige et al 2014 using geographic information system gis as a tool in groundwater modeling procedure can be truly helpful because all parameters such as distribution of rainfall groundwater recharge and discharge and also land cover are defined within a spatial context singh and fiorentino 1996 several researchers have took advantage of this powerful tool directly or as a parallel method in integrated approaches dar et al 2010 nampak et al 2014 alonso contes 2011 used remote sensing and advanced digital image processing techniques to delineate karst features which can enhance the understanding with regard to hydrogeology of the tanamá river and rio grande de arecibo catchments located in the north coast tertiary basin of puerto rico basically remote sensing tools have assisted the author in lineament mapping for gw exploration also manda and gross have employed gis analysis to characterize solution conduits in karstic areas based on their study they have shown that gis based methods can be used for determining depths dimensions shapes apertures and connectivity of potential conduits and also for describing physical characteristics that have an effect on the groundwater flow in karst aquifers manda and gross 2006 in addition theilen willige et al employed gis and remote sensing methods by analyzing satellite data in order to detect of near surface faults and fracture zones that can lead to dissolution processes in conduits of karst aquifers theilen willige et al 2014 numerous researchers have taken advantage of remote sensing techniques to improve their models and solve some un answered and complex problems by increasing the accuracy of prediction and also by taking into account other hydrological phenomena ashraf and ahmad 2012 machiwal et al 2012 thakur et al 2016 xu et al 2011 table 3 elaborates the potential application of gis and remote sensing in different phases of integrated groundwater modeling 5 conclusion it is vital to employ a comprehensive and efficient approach for managing water resources in regions where groundwater is the main source of water supply and vulnerable to contamination e g karst aquifers limestone karstic aquifer systems of northern puerto rico has been experiencing high level of contamination resulting in accelerating rate of preterm births in the island in addition to other human health related disorders several wells and sites were listed as the national priority list npl superfund sites and remediation action for treating water in these sites are ongoing by considering this island as a case study location and also by focusing on karst aquifers as the most complicated and hard to analyze forms of aquifers a review study was presented to qualitatively and quantitatively assess groundwater resources after an explanation of karst systems and their associated study methods in addition to surface water and gw interaction swgwi a brief review discussion on groundwater contamination and risk assessment was presented potential contamination threats in karst aquifers were discussed and different remediation techniques were evaluated furthermore a comprehensive discussion on existing groundwater modeling methods with regard to their application advantages and disadvantages was presented mostly numerical modeling approaches are taken by modelers to simulate complex groundwater systems numerical modeling tools often take advantage of finite difference and finite element techniques to solve complicated equations that governs hydrological system dynamics in an aquifer for karst aquifers lumped models and spatially distributed models are considered as two general modeling approaches that can be used in certain conditions in addition various computer based models such as modflow have been explained and evaluated a combined set of models can be used to simulate groundwater flow and contaminant transport either in steady state or transient form additionally application of remote sensing and gis in assessing water resources in karst and also for modeling purposes was explained overall it can be asserted that karst aquifers have the most complex behavior compared to other aquifer types because of their high level of permeability they are always prone to contamination hence employing different methods for studying karst aquifer and their inter relationship with surface water and ground surface may lead to different level of accuracy using integrated techniques by taking advantage of different methods for a case study and collecting sufficient data is costly but will greatly enhance the understanding and investigation of a certain karst aquifer such integrated techniques and data collection processes are recommended for north coast karst aquifer of puerto rico where the human health and ecosystem are at high risk from sustainable development perspective environmental economic and social impacts are consequences of water pollution in any region of the world hence careful attention should be paid to preserve water resources acknowledgements this work was supported by the us national institute of environmental

12274,groundwater samples via tubewells were collected from the district saharanpur uttar pradesh india the study aimed to analyse groundwater quality and potential sources of trace metal contamination using the multivariate statistical tool and the level of contamination by applying contamination index cd and heavy metal pollution index hpi the groundwater was found to be enriched with fe and contaminated with the trace and toxic elements like al as b cu mn and pb having mean values of 2786 152 9 1033 107 199 and 15 µl respectively arsenic exceeded the who 2011 guidelines and bis 2012 standard 10 µg l for 30 of the groundwater samples for b 46 of the samples were found having concentration higher than bis 2012 permissible limit 1000 µg l and 3 to who 2011 guideline values 2400 µl lead level exceeded the bis 2012 standard value and who 2011 guideline value in 46 of the samples multivariate analysis identified three factors responsible for data composition explaining 81 of the total variance in groundwater samples factor analysis pca and ca allowed grouping of parameters according to the common features fe mn and pb were associated with pc1 and controlled by the mixed origin such as geogenic sources as well as anthropogenic activities boron and cu pc2 were controlled by anthropogenic activities while as pc3 was derived from the geogenic sources the northern part of study area has higher pb and mn concentration than the southern part associated with small industrial activities degree of contamination and heavy metal pollution index supported the results and higher contamination was found to be in the vicinity of industrial setups the overall quality estimated using hpi values of groundwater in the northern area is poor and may cause potential health risk from the analyzed tubewells to the local population if the water is consumed for longer time graphical abstract fx1 keywords groundwater contamination trace metals potential sources spatial distribution heavy metal pollution index degree of contamination 1 introduction trace metals contamination in the groundwater may occur either due to the geogenic or anthropogenic activities some trace metals such as cobalt cd copper cu zinc zn and selenium se are essential for humans but its high level may cause physiological disorders trace metals like cadmium cd chromium cr and lead pb are very toxic at low concentrations jain et al 2010 anthropogenic activities such as industrialization and urbanization have led to the problem of environmental pollution in the current world according to the united nations 2002 reports 50 of the world s population exists in urban areas and is increasing at a higher rate due to the continuous progressive livelihood of humans environmental pollution affects the air soil and water quality in an extremely poor manner it is noteworthy that groundwater makes upto 20 of the world s freshwater supply but comprises of only 0 61 of the entire world s water resources including oceans and permanent ice caps khanam and singh 2014 an inimitable physical and chemical characteristics of water makes it a precious natural resource which is the basis of life on earth groundwater out of the total fresh water is the most significant available sources of potable water in the world khanam and singh 2014 in the developing countries like india groundwater is used for many purposes such as agricultural industrial and domestic the uncontrolled disposal of industrial agricultural and household waste has led to the pollution of groundwater yadav et al 2012 groundwater pollution leads to negative impact on the aquatic habitat and human health alkarkhi et al 2008 several studies from india kumar et al 2006 krishna et al 2009 mondal et al 2010 chakrabarty and sharma 2011 singh et al 2011 mahato et al 2016 and worldwide liao et al 2005 wang et al 2005 katsoyiannis and katsoyiannis 2006 leung and jiao 2006 zhou et al 2008 jan et al 2010 karim 2011 linhua et al 2013 wongsasuluk et al 2014 kumar et al 2018a have reported that rapid industrialization and urbanization had led to the trace metal accumulation in water and soil groundwater contamination caused by the contaminants such as arsenic as chromium cr iron fe pesticides and other industrial chemicals are increasing day by day there is a need for serious environmental concern as the water pollution is leading to the overexploitation of groundwater generally considered as clean water attributed to the depletion of water level studies have been carried out to determine the groundwater quality in uttar pradesh india singh et al 2006 nainital uttarakhand jain et al 2010 and ghaziabad uttar pradesh singh et al 2012 in a study concerning physicochemical characteristics groundwater was found to be more toxic in the urbanized area in comparison to the rural areas in delhi the capital city of india trivedi et al 2001 the rural urban relocation of population may be the cause of groundwater quality deterioration in urban areas raju et al 2011 according to naik et al 2008 it has also been postulated that groundwater contamination is not solely due to the expansion of urbanization but also because of the lack of concern from the public towards this treasured resource the chances of groundwater contamination becomes more prominent if the urban setup is coupled with industrialization the pulp and paper making industries rank third in terms of water consumption the amount and level of contamination depends on the process and its effectiveness the pulp and paper industry is considered as the third largest polluter in the united states us pokhrel and viraraghavan 2004 the volume of waste water generated by the pulping and bleaching process is roughly in the range of 75 225 m3 ton of product ansari 2004 a higher level of cu 49 000 µg kg and pb 59 000 µg kg has been reported in the paddy soil irrigated by the paper mill effluents near nanjangud mysore district karnataka india than the unpolluted areas fazeli et al 1998 zaisheng 2003 suggested that in the developing and highly populated country like china enhanced urbanization may adversely affect the groundwater quality and quantity there is a fast expansion of urbanization and industrialization in saharanpur district study area in the last few decades it has been noticed from the previous study using gis and remote sensing that there was an increase of 65 5 and 77 04 in urbanization and industrialization respectively within a decade 1988 1998 fazal 2000 greater than the double of previously covered area to assess the groundwater quality random distribution analysis is a significant monitoring assessment method aswathanarayana 1995 different multivariate statistical techniques are available for the distribution analysis which provides an evaluation of source identification of the contaminants in this study principal component analysis pca and cluster analysis ca were applied to the data obtained from the analysis of groundwater samples the principal component analysis method was found to be very useful in assessing the source of contamination and has been previously used in many geochemical studies yu et al 2000 facchinelli et al 2001 qu and kelderman 2001 manta et al 2002 filgueiras et al 2004 boruvka et al 2005 wang et al 2005 the cluster analysis method is combined with pca to confirm the results and it also provides interaction of the individual parameters and variables tariq et al 2006 mathematical analysis and modeling cannot represent the water pollutant categories which can be better explained by the index method for water quality assessment the water quality index can better provide mechanism for representing the health of water quality in a numerical expression contamination index cd the groundwater quality studies for saharanpur district are insufficient and requires pollution database of this region the objective of this study was to perform qualitative and comparative analysis in accordance with the world health organization who 2011 guidelines and bureau of indian standards bis 2012 standard for drinking water which mainly comes from the underground resource in saharanpur district uttar pradesh india an attempt has also been directed to understand the source of contamination in the surveyed area and the overall quality of groundwater based on parameters analyzed by applying numerical equations and heavy metal pollution index hpi 2 material and methods 2 1 study area description and hydrogeological framework

households in this area depends on the hand pumps to meet their daily requirement of water for drinking and other needs the average annual rainfall has been reported as 1541 9 mm from which maximum occurs in the monsoon season 1188 7 mm kaur and purohit 2013 the primary occupation of residing population in the nearby villages of saharanpur district is agriculture its major industries are agro based like sugarcane plant paper mill tobacco wood work cotton industry etc singh and dev 2011 small industries like textile factory card board factory verma et al 1978 dye chemical plant and welding shops also serve the study area range of added agriculture based industries and enterprises like sugar paper cigarette and textile factories are also situated in this city yadav and mahara 2018 it is one of the most important centers for industries and trade and is mainly famous for its wood carving work the area is mostly covered by recent river filled eroded sediments sandstones are exposed in the north eastern part yamuna fault is present in the north along the yamuna river fluvial sediments laid down under himalayas underlies larger part of the study area the material is mostly unconsolidated in formations comprising the area been deposited through mighty rivers originating from great himalayan mountains these sediments are an admixture of pebble gravel sand silt clay and kankar prasad et al 2014 15 the sediments are generally coarser in the north and gradually become finer south east ward along downstream of the drainage which is a typical feature of fluvial deposits this zone consists of mainly two parts the terai and the alluvial plain however foot hill zone is very small part of bhaber belt and lies in the northern part of saharanpur district the alluvial plain occupies the area south of terai and can further be divided into two sub units younger alluvium and older alluvium prasad et al 2014 15 the upper part of first aquifer down to 50 m below ground level bgl is the main source of drinking water through hand pumps and dug wells and is unconfined prasad et al 2014 15 the first aquifer as a whole which is under unconfined to semi confined conditions is the most potential aquifer group which is the primary source of groundwater in the study area extensively exploited through private as well as government tube wells to meet the drinking water and irrigation needs the deeper aquifers are confined in nature being exploited to an insufficient extent the yield of the second aquifer is limited while the third aquifer is potential source of groundwater the shallow and phreatic aquifers are under heavy stress the depth to water level varies from 5 to 10 m bgl and occurs all along the ganga yamuna and ganga yamuna interfluve area in patches in saharanpur district prasad et al 2014 15 2 2 sample collection preservation transportation and instrumentation used selected functional tubewells were sampled randomly from different locations after a survey in the saharanpur district area to represent the groundwater quality these tubewells are being used by the residing population for their daily need of water the standing water was removed from the casing by pumping the tubewells for 10 min to get the representative samples the tubewells sampled were mostly tapped in the shallow aquifer ranged from 24 to 61 m measurement of all the physical parameters was done using flow through cell method to minimize contact with the atmosphere the device flow through the cell was made by making a hole in the cylindrical box for insertion of the measurement electrodes and continuous flow of excess water through another small hole kumar et al 2018b the measurement of all the field parameters and sample collection was done by following a standard procedure wood 1981 location of the tubewells were marked on the portable garmin gps garmin etrex30 physical parameters like ph electrical conductivity ec total dissolved solids tds oxidation reduction potential orp and dissolved oxygen were tested in a box flowing water by using a portable hanna multiparameter hi 9828 the device was calibrated with the standard before starting test in the field 250 ml of water sample was collected in pre cleaned and dried polypropylene bottles followed by acidification by adding 2 3 drops of 6 m hno3 and stored at 4 c to prevent chemical alteration apha 2005 the samples were transported by air to the water chemistry laboratory of the department of sustainable development environmental science and engineering kth royal institute of technology stockholm sweden for further analysis an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes varian vista pro was used to determine the concentration of major cations in the groundwater detection limits for each elements has been given in table 1 2 3 data compilation and statistical analysis used a map of the study was prepared in arc map 10 2 v 10 2 all the maps of spatial distribution were made in surfer v 8 0 following kriging gridding method the pearson correlation coefficient was used to determine strength of relationships among the reported trace and toxic elements in this area the p value of 0 01 was considered to indicate statistical significance multivariate analysis was performed on the data using the method of principal component analysis pca and cluster analysis ca to determine the association between individual elements in the groundwater using spss 21 cluster analysis is used to assign the class of samples or parameters that are identical to each other but different from the samples or parameters from another cluster it is a tool to partition set of samples or parameters into groups or clusters the individuals or parameter of the same group are similar to each other and dissimilar to other groups or clusters ewritt 1974 hartigan 1975 the principal component analysis allows us to minimize set of individual or observed variables into a smaller set of variables called the principal components which can be used in further analysis it can be described as a variable reduction tool into an optimally weighted set of individual or observed variables representing most of the observed variable each variable measured scores for each of the components and after optimally weighing each score it is summed up to compute the score of a component diamantaras and kung 1996 cichocki and amari 2002 jolliffe 2002 the equation to calculate the first component extracted in a principal component analysis is c1 b11 x1 b12 x2 b1n xn where c1 individual s score on the first principal component b1n regression coefficient for the observed variable n xn individual s score on observed variable n in practice the number of observed individuals or variables analyzed is equal to the number of components extracted in the principal component analysis however most of the variance is represented by few components so only these first few components are interpreted and used in further analysis and the remaining other components account for only an insignificant amount of variance for better results factors with eigenvalues greater than one were taken into consideration contamination index is used to explain the concentration of parameters and permissible upper limit of pollutant akoteyon 2012 backman et al 1998 expressed contamination index as cd i 1 n cfi and cfi ci ci mpl 1 where cd degree of contamination or contamination index cfi contamination factor of the i th component ci analytical value of the i th component and cimpl upper permissible limit of the i th component the characterization of contamination level in different sites by contamination factor cf was modified from lesage 1992 the contamination factor represents ratio of observed concentration to the upper permissible concentration of the individual elements it was assumed that if the ratio is 1 the site is safe while 1 value represents contamination the more significant the resultant contamination factor the larger is the contamination level the contamination index cd is calculated individually for each water sample it is the sum of contaminant factors of each component exceeding the maximum permissible contaminant levels thus the cd or degree of contamination is the sum of contamination factor of all quality parameters which have exceeded the permissible limit and have a harmful effect on human health as well as on the environment the ci or degree of contamination shows further scale as cd 1 low or no contamination 1 cd 3 medium contamination and cd 3 high contamination heavy metal pollution index is a very useful tool to estimate the overall impact of all the measured parameters hpi i 1 n wiqi i 1 n wi where wi is the unit weightage defined as the reciprocal value of si si is the permissible value for drinking water and n is the number of parameters considered qi is the sub index of the i th parameter and calculated by eq q i 1 n mi ii si ii 100 where mi is the monitored value of the heavy metal ii is the maximum desirable value and si is the standard value of the i th parameter in ppb µg

factor analysis identified three factors to be responsible for data structure explaining 81 984 of the total variance allowed grouping of the elements al fe mn and pb in a group and forming pc1 with cumulative variance of 31 547 another group of b and cu formed pc2 having cumulative variance of 62 815 as was observed in pc3 standalone with a cumulative variance of 80 984 fig 5 a the pca results were supported by ca in which mn pb al and fe formed one cluster while b and cu formed another cluster fig 5 b as was distantly clustered with all the trace elements it was noticed that there was a paper mill close to nh 57 towards the south side and a dye plant in the center of the study area of saharanpur close to the crossing of nh 57 and nh 73 fig 1 the pca 1 may be attributed to mixed natural and anthropogenic source of contamination in the study area an increase with time years in trace metal contamination like cu cd pb zn and cr has been observed in groundwater in the vicinity of a paper mill in namakkai district tamil nadu india rekha et al 2004 in the study done by fazeli et al 1998 higher concentration of cr and ni were found in the tubewell near paper mill nanajangud karnataka in the study done by husain et al 2014 in saganer rajasthan dubey et al 2010 in panipat haryana and balakrishnan et al 2008 in kacheepuram a higher concentration of fe cr and mn was found from the groundwater in proximity of the dye industries pc2 may be attributed to the purely anthropogenic contribution in the surveyed area indicating that b and cu contamination may be due to the wastewater effluent from the domestic papermill dye plant the second largest use of b worldwide measured as borate consumption is in laundry products in which sodium perborate functions as a whitening agent smith 2002 3 2 3 contamination factor and contamination index contamination factor in table 3 shows lower contamination i e below one in al except sample 13 as b ba cd cr cu mn and zn almost all of the sites show higher contamination factor for fe i e contamination factor 1 69 of the samples contamination factor 5 38 of the samples contamination factor 10 15 of the samples 38 of the samples show contamination factor 1 for pb and 23 of the samples show contamination factor 1 for b the highest contamination factor was found to be 32 12 for fe with mean contamination factor value of 8 29 sample 13 shows contamination factor 1 for al fe and mn which could be due to its proximity to the dye and paper industry in the saharanpur area calculated values of the contamination factor degree of contamination or cd range varied from 0 to 34 89 with the mean value of 9 for different sampling locations fig 6 shows that more than 50 of the sampling points have higher contamination locations 5 6 7 8 10 11 and 13 15 samples show medium contamination locations 4 and 12 whereas 30 of the samples show lower contamination locations 1 2 3 and 9 in the study done by bhuiya et al 2010 in the agricultural zone barapukuria floodplain area of bangladesh a higher value of contamination index was found ranging from 3 45 to 85 in another study done on the groundwater of busan city korea by venkatramanan et al 2015 95 of the samples were found to be in the low and medium zone and only 5 lied in the higher zone of contamination 3 2 4 heavy metal pollution index heavy metal pollution index was calculated separately for all the locations and presented in fig 7 the pollution index calculated with mean values of all the sampling locations was 45 506 which is below half of the permissible or critical index value 100 table 4 sampling locations 5 8 10 and 13 revealed higher values of hpi ranged 83 91 hence indicating higher contamination than the other locations these results were also compiled with contamination index fig 6 where sample locations 6 7 8 10 and 11 fell into the category of medium contamination while the sample locations 5 and 13 fell into higher contamination these locations were close to a dye chemical plant the estimated hpi values for sample locations 1 2 3 4 6 9 and 12 were far below the permissible or critical index value which indicated water to be safe for drinking purpose and free from heavy metal pollution in a study ugljesnica river serbia the estimated hpi values were used to know the seasonal variation in river water spring season 67 487 and autumn season 80 676 and concluded that during spring season increased rainfall lead to the rise in river water level and subsequent dilution effect of rainfall results in the decrease of hpi milivojević et al 2016 a mean hpi value of 3 5243 estimated for pb cd zn and cu was observed from 12 stations in tirupati town india which indicated water to be safe for drinking purpose mohan et al 1996 in a study done on groundwater observed that the concentration of al fe mn and ni exceeded desirable limits in many groundwater samples in both the seasons but hpi values were below the critical index value tiwari et al 2016 3 3 spatial distribution of the trace metals and overall quality of groundwater in the study area the spatial distribution maps of al as b cu fe mn and pb which were reported in a higher concentration exceed who 2011 standard values and bis 2012 guideline values in groundwater of saharanpur district have been demonstrated in fig 8 the colour pattern of spatial distribution maps ranged from green to yellow light red and dark red lower concentrations to higher concentrations iron mn al and pb showed same pattern of distribution although their concentrations differ from each other indicating that these elements may have had the same source these metals formed a group in pca and ca as well fig 5a b aluminium and as exhibited hot spots in the center of study area but these metals were grouped differently in cluster analysis it is known that presence of higher concentration of as in groundwater of gangetic basin may be attributed to geogenic contribution meharg and rahman 2003 kumar et al 2016 chakraborti et al 2017 kumar et al 2018b boron and cu show higher concentration towards the north and south of the study area manganese has similar distribution pattern as pb indicating their common source of origin which was also supported by multivariate analysis higher mn concentration was found to be associated with the surrounding industrial zone in district gautam buddha nagar uttar pradesh india kumar et al 2017 chromium and mn hotspots were in the north west of the study area associated with the surrounding industrial zone the southern part of the study area was found to be free from pb and mn iron enrichment was observed in the north western zone of the surveyed area the distribution pattern of trace and toxic metals may have been affected by the various sources of contamination but a more in depth statistical analysis is required to understand the source of contamination the hpi represented overall quality of groundwater in the study area and indicated that water quality is comparatively poor in northern part of the study area although estimated values of hpi were below the critical index value 100 throughout the study area still there may be potential health risks from the analyzed tubewells to the local population if consumed water for longer time 4 conclusion the current study reported that as exceeded the who 2011 guidelines and bis 2012 standards of 10 µg l in one third of the tubewell water analyzed the groundwater was found to be contaminated with trace and toxic elements like al as b cu mn and pb for b 46 of the samples were found having a concentration higher than the bis 2012 permissible limit 1000 µg l and 3 to the who 2011 guideline values 2400 µl the level of pb exceeded the bis 2012 and who 2011 concentration in 46 of the samples factor analysis pca and ca identified three factors responsible for data structure explaining 81 of the total variance allowed grouping of the elements al fe mn and pb in a group and formed pc1 b cu mn and pb in another group and formed pc2 as was observed in the pc3 standalone the pca results were supported by ca in which mn pb al and fe formed a cluster while b and cu formed another cluster as was distantly clustered with all the trace elements contamination index revealed no contamination at almost all the sites except for the locations 6 10 11 and 13 it was concluded from the estimated hpi values that groundwater of the study area was free from heavy metal pollution except at few locations which may cause future problems the northern part of the study area has higher pb and mn concentration than the southern part northern part of the study exhibited poor groundwater quality and may cause potential health risks to the residing population

12274,groundwater samples via tubewells were collected from the district saharanpur uttar pradesh india the study aimed to analyse groundwater quality and potential sources of trace metal contamination using the multivariate statistical tool and the level of contamination by applying contamination index cd and heavy metal pollution index hpi the groundwater was found to be enriched with fe and contaminated with the trace and toxic elements like al as b cu mn and pb having mean values of 2786 152 9 1033 107 199 and 15 µl respectively arsenic exceeded the who 2011 guidelines and bis 2012 standard 10 µg l for 30 of the groundwater samples for b 46 of the samples were found having concentration higher than bis 2012 permissible limit 1000 µg l and 3 to who 2011 guideline values 2400 µl lead level exceeded the bis 2012 standard value and who 2011 guideline value in 46 of the samples multivariate analysis identified three factors responsible for data composition explaining 81 of the total variance in groundwater samples factor analysis pca and ca allowed grouping of parameters according to the common features fe mn and pb were associated with pc1 and controlled by the mixed origin such as geogenic sources as well as anthropogenic activities boron and cu pc2 were controlled by anthropogenic activities while as pc3 was derived from the geogenic sources the northern part of study area has higher pb and mn concentration than the southern part associated with small industrial activities degree of contamination and heavy metal pollution index supported the results and higher contamination was found to be in the vicinity of industrial setups the overall quality estimated using hpi values of groundwater in the northern area is poor and may cause potential health risk from the analyzed tubewells to the local population if the water is consumed for longer time graphical abstract fx1 keywords groundwater contamination trace metals potential sources spatial distribution heavy metal pollution index degree of contamination 1 introduction trace metals contamination in the groundwater may occur either due to the geogenic or anthropogenic activities some trace metals such as cobalt cd copper cu zinc zn and selenium se are essential for humans but its high level may cause physiological disorders trace metals like cadmium cd chromium cr and lead pb are very toxic at low concentrations jain et al 2010 anthropogenic activities such as industrialization and urbanization have led to the problem of environmental pollution in the current world according to the united nations 2002 reports 50 of the world s population exists in urban areas and is increasing at a higher rate due to the continuous progressive livelihood of humans environmental pollution affects the air soil and water quality in an extremely poor manner it is noteworthy that groundwater makes upto 20 of the world s freshwater supply but comprises of only 0 61 of the entire world s water resources including oceans and permanent ice caps khanam and singh 2014 an inimitable physical and chemical characteristics of water makes it a precious natural resource which is the basis of life on earth groundwater out of the total fresh water is the most significant available sources of potable water in the world khanam and singh 2014 in the developing countries like india groundwater is used for many purposes such as agricultural industrial and domestic the uncontrolled disposal of industrial agricultural and household waste has led to the pollution of groundwater yadav et al 2012 groundwater pollution leads to negative impact on the aquatic habitat and human health alkarkhi et al 2008 several studies from india kumar et al 2006 krishna et al 2009 mondal et al 2010 chakrabarty and sharma 2011 singh et al 2011 mahato et al 2016 and worldwide liao et al 2005 wang et al 2005 katsoyiannis and katsoyiannis 2006 leung and jiao 2006 zhou et al 2008 jan et al 2010 karim 2011 linhua et al 2013 wongsasuluk et al 2014 kumar et al 2018a have reported that rapid industrialization and urbanization had led to the trace metal accumulation in water and soil groundwater contamination caused by the contaminants such as arsenic as chromium cr iron fe pesticides and other industrial chemicals are increasing day by day there is a need for serious environmental concern as the water pollution is leading to the overexploitation of groundwater generally considered as clean water attributed to the depletion of water level studies have been carried out to determine the groundwater quality in uttar pradesh india singh et al 2006 nainital uttarakhand jain et al 2010 and ghaziabad uttar pradesh singh et al 2012 in a study concerning physicochemical characteristics groundwater was found to be more toxic in the urbanized area in comparison to the rural areas in delhi the capital city of india trivedi et al 2001 the rural urban relocation of population may be the cause of groundwater quality deterioration in urban areas raju et al 2011 according to naik et al 2008 it has also been postulated that groundwater contamination is not solely due to the expansion of urbanization but also because of the lack of concern from the public towards this treasured resource the chances of groundwater contamination becomes more prominent if the urban setup is coupled with industrialization the pulp and paper making industries rank third in terms of water consumption the amount and level of contamination depends on the process and its effectiveness the pulp and paper industry is considered as the third largest polluter in the united states us pokhrel and viraraghavan 2004 the volume of waste water generated by the pulping and bleaching process is roughly in the range of 75 225 m3 ton of product ansari 2004 a higher level of cu 49 000 µg kg and pb 59 000 µg kg has been reported in the paddy soil irrigated by the paper mill effluents near nanjangud mysore district karnataka india than the unpolluted areas fazeli et al 1998 zaisheng 2003 suggested that in the developing and highly populated country like china enhanced urbanization may adversely affect the groundwater quality and quantity there is a fast expansion of urbanization and industrialization in saharanpur district study area in the last few decades it has been noticed from the previous study using gis and remote sensing that there was an increase of 65 5 and 77 04 in urbanization and industrialization respectively within a decade 1988 1998 fazal 2000 greater than the double of previously covered area to assess the groundwater quality random distribution analysis is a significant monitoring assessment method aswathanarayana 1995 different multivariate statistical techniques are available for the distribution analysis which provides an evaluation of source identification of the contaminants in this study principal component analysis pca and cluster analysis ca were applied to the data obtained from the analysis of groundwater samples the principal component analysis method was found to be very useful in assessing the source of contamination and has been previously used in many geochemical studies yu et al 2000 facchinelli et al 2001 qu and kelderman 2001 manta et al 2002 filgueiras et al 2004 boruvka et al 2005 wang et al 2005 the cluster analysis method is combined with pca to confirm the results and it also provides interaction of the individual parameters and variables tariq et al 2006 mathematical analysis and modeling cannot represent the water pollutant categories which can be better explained by the index method for water quality assessment the water quality index can better provide mechanism for representing the health of water quality in a numerical expression contamination index cd the groundwater quality studies for saharanpur district are insufficient and requires pollution database of this region the objective of this study was to perform qualitative and comparative analysis in accordance with the world health organization who 2011 guidelines and bureau of indian standards bis 2012 standard for drinking water which mainly comes from the underground resource in saharanpur district uttar pradesh india an attempt has also been directed to understand the source of contamination in the surveyed area and the overall quality of groundwater based on parameters analyzed by applying numerical equations and heavy metal pollution index hpi 2 material and methods 2 1 study area description and hydrogeological framework saharanpur district occupies an area of about 3689 km2 in the northernmost side of uttar pradesh india fig 1 represents map of the study area with the corresponding sample locations saharanpur district is situated close to the foothill region of shivalik range having its border adjacent to haryana and uttarakhand and lies in the northern part of the ganga yamuna doab region the district headquarters is saharanpur city and it belongs to the saharanpur division the major towns in the saharanpur district is behat deoband gangoh and rampur maniharan the study area is located at 29 97 n 77 55 e about 170 km 106 mi north northeast from delhi the capital city of india it lies at an average elevation of 284 m 932 ft has a population of 3 464 228 and population density of 939 people km2 census of india 2011 around 69 23 of the district s population lives in rural area and 30 77 of the population lives in the urban land of saharanpur district census of india 2011 the maximum number of households in this area depends on the hand pumps to meet their daily requirement of water for drinking and other needs the average annual rainfall has been reported as 1541 9 mm from which maximum occurs in the monsoon season 1188 7 mm kaur and purohit 2013 the primary occupation of residing population in the nearby villages of saharanpur district is agriculture its major industries are agro based like sugarcane plant paper mill tobacco wood work cotton industry etc singh and dev 2011 small industries like textile factory card board factory verma et al 1978 dye chemical plant and welding shops also serve the study area range of added agriculture based industries and enterprises like sugar paper cigarette and textile factories are also situated in this city yadav and mahara 2018 it is one of the most important centers for industries and trade and is mainly famous for its wood carving work the area is mostly covered by recent river filled eroded sediments sandstones are exposed in the north eastern part yamuna fault is present in the north along the yamuna river fluvial sediments laid down under himalayas underlies larger part of the study area the material is mostly unconsolidated in formations comprising the area been deposited through mighty rivers originating from great himalayan mountains these sediments are an admixture of pebble gravel sand silt clay and kankar prasad et al 2014 15 the sediments are generally coarser in the north and gradually become finer south east ward along downstream of the drainage which is a typical feature of fluvial deposits this zone consists of mainly two parts the terai and the alluvial plain however foot hill zone is very small part of bhaber belt and lies in the northern part of saharanpur district the alluvial plain occupies the area south of terai and can further be divided into two sub units younger alluvium and older alluvium prasad et al 2014 15 the upper part of first aquifer down to 50 m below ground level bgl is the main source of drinking water through hand pumps and dug wells and is unconfined prasad et al 2014 15 the first aquifer as a whole which is under unconfined to semi confined conditions is the most potential aquifer group which is the primary source of groundwater in the study area extensively exploited through private as well as government tube wells to meet the drinking water and irrigation needs the deeper aquifers are confined in nature being exploited to an insufficient extent the yield of the second aquifer is limited while the third aquifer is potential source of groundwater the shallow and phreatic aquifers are under heavy stress the depth to water level varies from 5 to 10 m bgl and occurs all along the ganga yamuna and ganga yamuna interfluve area in patches in saharanpur district prasad et al 2014 15 2 2 sample collection preservation transportation and instrumentation used selected functional tubewells were sampled randomly from different locations after a survey in the saharanpur district area to represent the groundwater quality these tubewells are being used by the residing population for their daily need of water the standing water was removed from the casing by pumping the tubewells for 10 min to get the representative samples the tubewells sampled were mostly tapped in the shallow aquifer ranged from 24 to 61 m measurement of all the physical parameters was done using flow through cell method to minimize contact with the atmosphere the device flow through the cell was made by making a hole in the cylindrical box for insertion of the measurement electrodes and continuous flow of excess water through another small hole kumar et al 2018b the measurement of all the field parameters and sample collection was done by following a standard procedure wood 1981 location of the tubewells were marked on the portable garmin gps garmin etrex30 physical parameters like ph electrical conductivity ec total dissolved solids tds oxidation reduction potential orp and dissolved oxygen were tested in a box flowing water by using a portable hanna multiparameter hi 9828 the device was calibrated with the standard before starting test in the field 250 ml of water sample was collected in pre cleaned and dried polypropylene bottles followed by acidification by adding 2 3 drops of 6 m hno3 and stored at 4 c to prevent chemical alteration apha 2005 the samples were transported by air to the water chemistry laboratory of the department of sustainable development environmental science and engineering kth royal institute of technology stockholm sweden for further analysis an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes varian vista pro was used to determine the concentration of major cations in the groundwater detection limits for each elements has been given in table 1 2 3 data compilation and statistical analysis used a map of the study was prepared in arc map 10 2 v 10 2 all the maps of spatial distribution were made in surfer v 8 0 following kriging gridding method the pearson correlation coefficient was used to determine strength of relationships among the reported trace and toxic elements in this area the p value of 0 01 was considered to indicate statistical significance multivariate analysis was performed on the data using the method of principal component analysis pca and cluster analysis ca to determine the association between individual elements in the groundwater using spss 21 cluster analysis is used to assign the class of samples or parameters that are identical to each other but different from the samples or parameters from another cluster it is a tool to partition set of samples or parameters into groups or clusters the individuals or parameter of the same group are similar to each other and dissimilar to other groups or clusters ewritt 1974 hartigan 1975 the principal component analysis allows us to minimize set of individual or observed variables into a smaller set of variables called the principal components which can be used in further analysis it can be described as a variable reduction tool into an optimally weighted set of individual or observed variables representing most of the observed variable each variable measured scores for each of the components and after optimally weighing each score it is summed up to compute the score of a component diamantaras and kung 1996 cichocki and amari 2002 jolliffe 2002 the equation to calculate the first component extracted in a principal component analysis is c1 b11 x1 b12 x2 b1n xn where c1 individual s score on the first principal component b1n regression coefficient for the observed variable n xn individual s score on observed variable n in practice the number of observed individuals or variables analyzed is equal to the number of components extracted in the principal component analysis however most of the variance is represented by few components so only these first few components are interpreted and used in further analysis and the remaining other components account for only an insignificant amount of variance for better results factors with eigenvalues greater than one were taken into consideration contamination index is used to explain the concentration of parameters and permissible upper limit of pollutant akoteyon 2012 backman et al 1998 expressed contamination index as cd i 1 n cfi and cfi ci ci mpl 1 where cd degree of contamination or contamination index cfi contamination factor of the i th component ci analytical value of the i th component and cimpl upper permissible limit of the i th component the characterization of contamination level in different sites by contamination factor cf was modified from lesage 1992 the contamination factor represents ratio of observed concentration to the upper permissible concentration of the individual elements it was assumed that if the ratio is 1 the site is safe while 1 value represents contamination the more significant the resultant contamination factor the larger is the contamination level the contamination index cd is calculated individually for each water sample it is the sum of contaminant factors of each component exceeding the maximum permissible contaminant levels thus the cd or degree of contamination is the sum of contamination factor of all quality parameters which have exceeded the permissible limit and have a harmful effect on human health as well as on the environment the ci or degree of contamination shows further scale as cd 1 low or no contamination 1 cd 3 medium contamination and cd 3 high contamination heavy metal pollution index is a very useful tool to estimate the overall impact of all the measured parameters hpi i 1 n wiqi i 1 n wi where wi is the unit weightage defined as the reciprocal value of si si is the permissible value for drinking water and n is the number of parameters considered qi is the sub index of the i th parameter and calculated by eq q i 1 n mi ii si ii 100 where mi is the monitored value of the heavy metal ii is the maximum desirable value and si is the standard value of the i th parameter in ppb µg l 3 result and discussion 3 1 trace metals in the groundwater and comparison with previous studies from relevant areas the result of the analysis of various trace metals observed in groundwater samples have been represented in table 1 box plots are used to show overall pattern of response for a group of samples they provide useful way to visualise the range and other characteristics of responses for a large group box whisker plot fig 2 describes from top to bottom outliers maximum whisker upper quartiles 75 median 50 quartiles 25 whisker lower and minimum respectively for each metal analyzed respectively it is clearly indicated that there is a variation in concentration of all the metals analyzed no two metals are exhibited same values for all the statistics caesium and iron fe showed maximum range and median values among all the metals analyzed the estimated values of all the trace metals observed in groundwater were compared with the standard values acceptable permissible limits of bis 2012 and guideline values of who 2011 fig 3 along with this a comparative analysis was done with the trace metal contamination present in this area with the other relevant studies in india and worldwide table 2 aluminum al was observed in groundwater which ranged from 2 6 to 959 µg l mean 152 µg l in the case of al metal 77 of the water samples were found to be above the bis 2012

gautam buddha nagar uttar pradesh india kumar et al 2017 3 2 statistical analysis for estimated trace metals in groundwater of the study area 3 2 1 correlation analysis a correlation matrix was plotted to check association among the trace and toxic metals only found as contaminants exceeded to their respective who 2011 guideline values and bis 2012 standards in the study area and has been presented in fig 4 it has a good correlation with fe 0 53 p 0 01 and mn 0 57 p 0 01 indicating their common geogenic source good correlation was observed between b and pb 0 50 p 0 01 indicating their common source as purely anthropogenic manganese was observed to be significantly correlated with pb 0 73 p 0 01 in the study area indicating anthropogenic contribution laundry activities are the good source of b to the environment smith 2002 arsenic showed non significant but negative correlation with all the trace metals indicating different source for its presence in the groundwater of study area studies showed geogenic contribution of as to gangetic basin meharg and rahman 2003 chauhan et al 2009 kumar et al 2016a kumar et al 2016b 3 2 2 principal component analysis and cluster analysis factor analysis identified three factors to be responsible for data structure explaining 81 984 of the total variance allowed grouping of the elements al fe mn and pb in a group and forming pc1 with cumulative variance of 31 547 another group of b and cu formed pc2 having cumulative variance of 62 815 as was observed in pc3 standalone with a cumulative variance of 80 984 fig 5 a the pca results were supported by ca in which mn pb al and fe formed one cluster while b and cu formed another cluster fig 5 b as was distantly clustered with all the trace elements it was noticed that there was a paper mill close to nh 57 towards the south side and a dye plant in the center of the study area of saharanpur close to the crossing of nh 57 and nh 73 fig 1 the pca 1 may be attributed to mixed natural and anthropogenic source of contamination in the study area an increase with time years in trace metal contamination like cu cd pb zn and cr has been observed in groundwater in the vicinity of a paper mill in namakkai district tamil nadu india rekha et al 2004 in the study done by fazeli et al 1998 higher concentration of cr and ni were found in the tubewell near paper mill nanajangud karnataka in the study done by husain et al 2014 in saganer rajasthan dubey et al 2010 in panipat haryana and balakrishnan et al 2008 in kacheepuram a higher concentration of fe cr and mn was found from the groundwater in proximity of the dye industries pc2 may be attributed to the purely anthropogenic contribution in the surveyed area indicating that b and cu contamination may be due to the wastewater effluent from the domestic papermill dye plant the second largest use of b worldwide measured as borate consumption is in laundry products in which sodium perborate functions as a whitening agent smith 2002 3 2 3 contamination factor and contamination index contamination factor in table 3 shows lower contamination i e below one in al except sample 13 as b ba cd cr cu mn and zn almost all of the sites show higher contamination factor for fe i e contamination factor 1 69 of the samples contamination factor 5 38 of the samples contamination factor 10 15 of the samples 38 of the samples show contamination factor 1 for pb and 23 of the samples show contamination factor 1 for b the highest contamination factor was found to be 32 12 for fe with mean contamination factor value of 8 29 sample 13 shows contamination factor 1 for al fe and mn which could be due to its proximity to the dye and paper industry in the saharanpur area calculated values of the contamination factor degree of contamination or cd range varied from 0 to 34 89 with the mean value of 9 for different sampling locations fig 6 shows that more than 50 of the sampling points have higher contamination locations 5 6 7 8 10 11 and 13 15 samples show medium contamination locations 4 and 12 whereas 30 of the samples show lower contamination locations 1 2 3 and 9 in the study done by bhuiya et al 2010 in the agricultural zone barapukuria floodplain area of bangladesh a higher value of contamination index was found ranging from 3 45 to 85 in another study done on the groundwater of busan city korea by venkatramanan et al 2015 95 of the samples were found to be in the low and medium zone and only 5 lied in the higher zone of contamination 3 2 4 heavy metal pollution index heavy metal pollution index was calculated separately for all the locations and presented in fig 7 the pollution index calculated with mean values of all the sampling locations was 45 506 which is below half of the permissible or critical index value 100 table 4 sampling locations 5 8 10 and 13 revealed higher values of hpi ranged 83 91 hence indicating higher contamination than the other locations these results were also compiled with contamination index fig 6 where sample locations 6 7 8 10 and 11 fell into the category of medium contamination while the sample locations 5 and 13 fell into higher contamination these locations were close to a dye chemical plant the estimated hpi values for sample locations 1 2 3 4 6 9 and 12 were far below the permissible or critical index value which indicated water to be safe for drinking purpose and free from heavy metal pollution in a study ugljesnica river serbia the estimated hpi values were used to know the seasonal variation in river water spring season 67 487 and autumn season 80 676 and concluded that during spring season increased rainfall lead to the rise in river water level and subsequent dilution effect of rainfall results in the decrease of hpi milivojević et al 2016 a mean hpi value of 3 5243 estimated for pb cd zn and cu was observed from 12 stations in tirupati town india which indicated water to be safe for drinking purpose mohan et al 1996 in a study done on groundwater observed that the concentration of al fe mn and ni exceeded desirable limits in many groundwater samples in both the seasons but hpi values were below the critical index value tiwari et al 2016 3 3 spatial distribution of the trace metals and overall quality of groundwater in the study area the spatial distribution maps of al as b cu fe mn and pb which were reported in a higher concentration exceed who 2011 standard values and bis 2012 guideline values in groundwater of saharanpur district have been demonstrated in fig 8 the colour pattern of spatial distribution maps ranged from green to yellow light red and dark red lower concentrations to higher concentrations iron mn al and pb showed same pattern of distribution although their concentrations differ from each other indicating that these elements may have had the same source these metals formed a group in pca and ca as well fig 5a b aluminium and as exhibited hot spots in the center of study area but these metals were grouped differently in cluster analysis it is known that presence of higher concentration of as in groundwater of gangetic basin may be attributed to geogenic contribution meharg and rahman 2003 kumar et al 2016 chakraborti et al 2017 kumar et al 2018b boron and cu show higher concentration towards the north and south of the study area manganese has similar distribution pattern as pb indicating their common source of origin which was also supported by multivariate analysis higher mn concentration was found to be associated with the surrounding industrial zone in district gautam buddha nagar uttar pradesh india kumar et al 2017 chromium and mn hotspots were in the north west of the study area associated with the surrounding industrial zone the southern part of the study area was found to be free from pb and mn iron enrichment was observed in the north western zone of the surveyed area the distribution pattern of trace and toxic metals may have been affected by the various sources of contamination but a more in depth statistical analysis is required to understand the source of contamination the hpi represented overall quality of groundwater in the study area and indicated that water quality is comparatively poor in northern part of the study area although estimated values of hpi were below the critical index value 100 throughout the study area still there may be potential health risks from the analyzed tubewells to the local population if consumed water for longer time 4 conclusion the current study reported that as exceeded the who 2011 guidelines and bis 2012 standards of 10 µg l in one third of the tubewell water analyzed the groundwater was found to be contaminated with trace and toxic elements like al as b cu mn and pb for b 46 of the samples were found having a concentration higher than the bis 2012 permissible limit 1000 µg l and 3 to the who 2011 guideline values 2400 µl the level of pb exceeded the bis 2012 and who 2011 concentration in 46 of the samples factor analysis pca and ca identified three factors responsible for data structure explaining 81 of the total variance allowed grouping of the elements al fe mn and pb in a group and formed pc1 b cu mn and pb in another group and formed pc2 as was observed in the pc3 standalone the pca results were supported by ca in which mn pb al and fe formed a cluster while b and cu formed another cluster as was distantly clustered with all the trace elements contamination index revealed no contamination at almost all the sites except for the locations 6 10 11 and 13 it was concluded from the estimated hpi values that groundwater of the study area was free from heavy metal pollution except at few locations which may cause future problems the northern part of the study area has higher pb and mn concentration than the southern part northern part of the study exhibited poor groundwater quality and may cause potential health risks to the residing population
