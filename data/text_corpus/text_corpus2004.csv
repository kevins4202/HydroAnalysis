10020,the challenge of irrigation planning is that it involves various system components which is further exacerbated by uncertainties and risk preference in making decisions this study presents a simulation optimization framework under uncertainty by incorporating fuzzy credibility based optimization model with the hurwicz criterion and daily water balance simulation for irrigation planning the developed methodology can effectively handle fuzzy uncertainty in the objective function and constraints and readily analyze tradeoffs between optimal solutions of irrigation planning and risks associated with the decision makers preferences it can also derive several physical parameters expressed as water depth from the water balance of root zone for determining optimal irrigation water amount the hurwicz criterion fuzzy credibility constraints and other irrigation related constraints are imposed on the study system through the developed framework then its applicability is illustrated with a real case study in the jiefangzha irrigation subarea in the hetao irrigation district northwest china which is an arid area optimal results using three risk related parameters i e nine preference weights λ 0 1 0 2 and 0 9 of objective function and three credibility levels α 0 7 0 8 and 0 9 β 0 7 0 8 and 0 9 of fuzzy constraints have been generated for supporting irrigation planning based on these outcomes system benefits resulting from agricultural production have a slight growth with preference weights increase from 0 1 to 0 9 showing that optimistic criterion plays a decisive role in optimal irrigation planning solutions especially when preference weights are greater than 0 7 daily groundwater depth is presented in the given 81 scenarios for comparison showing the usefulness of the developed framework in practical applications therefore these findings are helpful for supporting irrigation planning and balancing tradeoffs between irrigation planning and risk preference for sustainable irrigated agriculture keywords irrigation planning fuzzy programming simulation optimization framework hurwicz criterion risk preference 1 introduction implementing a reasonable irrigation planning for optimal irrigation water allocation is crucial to improve water use efficiency and alleviate water shortages in arid and semiarid areas meanwhile various uncertain factors e g available water and land resources hydro meteorological information and crop parameters economic implications environmental standards and requirements and subjective preferences policy choices and their interactions render the irrigation planning problems more complicated for instance policy choices result in market fluctuations and changes in crop prices and thus farmers incentives to cultivate a particular crop may also be motivated affecting the planting area of crops environmental standards may be different when the strictest or intermediate ones are adopted these environmental regulations are directly linked with irrigation planning when considering water quality problems arisen from irrigation induced agricultural non point source pollution generally these factors are considered as the source of uncertainty because they are hardly quantified and impossible to be fully controllable thus considerable attention has been put into the problem of irrigation planning based on optimization modeling under uncertainty cai and rosegrant 2004 maqsood et al 2005 regulwar and gurav 2011 singh 2014 li et al 2016 2019 zhang et al 2019 generally three types of inexact optimization methods including interval linear programming ilp fuzzy mathematical programming fmp and stochastic mathematical programming smp are developed to deal with interval fuzzy and stochastic uncertainties respectively among them interval based method i e interval linear parameter programming can tackle interval parameters with unknown distribution information while it s incapable of solving problems of the violated constraints huang 1998 yang et al 2016 smp methods include two stage multi stage stochastic programming chance constrained programming and joint probabilistic programming which can deal with probabilistic uncertainty and provide explicit solutions with known distribution information while it s usually hindered by data requirement in the case of less historical data wen and iwamura 2008 xu and qin 2010 zhang et al 2018 2019 in contrast fmp has multiple methods for dealing with fuzzy variables such as fuzzy chance constrained programming fuzzy possibilistic programming and fuzzy flexible programming which can generate flexible solutions with less data requirements in a fuzzy environment liu and iwamura 1998 zhang et al 2009 ghahremani nahr et al 2019 in practice there are some imprecise information ambiguous statements and subjective human thinking in irrigation planning for example the price of maize is not less than 1 6 yuan kg and the risk level of water shortage is pretty high thus using fmp method to effectively solve irrigation planning problems is a potential option as credibility measure is self dual and its computation procedure is more efficient when the constraints are satisfied at credibility level with an allowable violation risk level shiraz et al 2017 accordingly fuzzy credibility constrained programming fccp method has been developed and used in various fields which is based on the concept of credibility measure initiated by liu and liu 2002 this method is proved to be effective for dealing with fuzzy parameters and violation constraints by transforming them into deterministic ones at each predetermined credibility level zhang et al 2012 however fccp method has difficulty in tackling uncertainties existing in the objective function and it cannot reflect risk preference of decision makers in general decision makers are expected to have different risk preferences e g optimistic or pessimistic attitudes to tackle uncertainty before management strategies are implemented an effective measure hurwicz criterion is introduced to address fuzzy uncertainty in the objective function and balance risk preference between optimistic criterion and pessimistic criterion lau et al 2010 the optimistic criterion is expected to always choose the best payoffs or least costs which is suitable for the adventurous decision makers pursuing high payoffs or low costs while the pessimistic criterion has an opposite implication that decision makers choose the minimum payoffs or maximum losses which appeals to the decision makers who are conservative to ensure their payoffs in an unfavorable way it is noted that both above mentioned criterions are extreme cases in fact making decisions based on a composite value derived from preference weights from optimistic to pessimistic criterion is desired to realize an appropriate compromise between the above two criterions which is called the hurwicz criterion hurwicz 1951 when preference weights are assigned to different values ranging from 0 to 1 0 the related scenarios can be generated to flexibly illustrate the risk preferences of decision makers for example lau et al 2010 proposed a fuzzy location model with the hurwicz criterion for optimal system design in e commerce zeng et al 2014 developed a two stage credibility constrained programming with the hurwicz criterion approach for water resources management in a typical arid region i e kaidu kongque river basin and water allocation patterns corresponding to risk options of decision makers e g adventurous or conservative preferences were generated nevertheless optimization model can provide the answer of what is best under some restrictive conditions and usually simply physical components such as irrigation soil water and groundwater moreover there is a frequently quantitative feedback among irrigation soil water movement in the crop root zone and groundwater aquifers which requires to consider physical process simulations for soil water and groundwater balance therefore to develop simulation optimization framework by integrating optimization model and daily water balance simulation is a promising strategy for making optimal irrigation planning for example georgiou and papamichail 2008 developed a nonlinear programming optimization model with an integrated soil water balance for optimal irrigation water allocation and crop planning singh 2010 used one dimensional simulation model to study on farm irrigation water management plans jiang et al 2016 presented a process based irrigation water management model through integration of two level optimization model and distributed agro hydrological model wang and guo 2021 proposed an inexact optimization framework considering regional agro hydrological process for irrigation water management under uncertainty these studies give insight into potential management strategies for irrigation planning by integrating agro hydrological process simulation however few studies were implemented previously on irrigation planning incorporated with the hurwicz criterion in irrigated agriculture therefore as the extensions of previous studies the primary objective of this study is to develop a simulation optimization framework under uncertainty for supporting irrigation planning that is fuzzy credibility constrained optimization model with the hurwicz criterion considering daily water balance simulation it has the following advantages in 1 effectively tackling fuzzy uncertainty in the objective function and double sided constraints and risk preference arisen from decision makers subjective attitudes 2 clearly illustrating daily variations of simulated physical parameters 3 readily generating flexible solutions of irrigation planning under different credibility levels and preference weights and 4 quantitatively balancing tradeoff between irrigation planning and risk preference of decision makers then the developed framework is applied to a case study in the jiefangzha irrigation subarea in the hid the upper reaches of the yellow river basin for optimal irrigation planning it is expected to identify appropriate management plans based on simulation optimization framework through giving several preference weights and credibility levels therefore the results can provide basis of irrigation planning and risk management under uncertainty in irrigated agriculture 2 the study system 2 1 the study area the hetao irrigation district hid is located in the upper reaches of the yellow river which covers a total area of 1120 000 ha and its arable area is 570 000 ha because it s labeled as an arid climate zone with less precipitation and large evaporation thus irrigation is the necessary measure for agricultural production which primarily rely on the yellow river water ren et al 2018a intensive and excessive water diversions for agricultural irrigation brings on waterlogging problems horizontal seepage from the multiple canals and percolation losses in the irrigated farmland also recharge the groundwater and result in the rising of groundwater table xu et al 2010 all of these factors thereby have led to shallow groundwater table in the irrigation area with an annual variation range of 0 5 3 0 m pereira et al 2007 the jiefangzha irrigation subarea is selected as the study area where is the second largest irrigation subarea in the hid fig 1 the study area has a total area of 215 700 ha and cultivated area accounts for nearly 66 in addition it is flat and the groundwater hydraulic gradient is low 0 02 the average annual precipitation is 155 mm with over 70 from july to september but annual evapotranspiration is approximately 2000 mm the main crops include maize sunflower spring wheat accounting for more than 85 of the total planting area different crops have different irrigation schedule because of their own growth cycle and characteristics there is partial overlap of growth period among these three crops table 1 shows crop growth stages and calendar of the study area for example spring wheat is sowed in late march 3 25 and harvested in the middle of july 7 14 surface basin irrigation is the mostly used irrigation method through multi level canal systems according to the statistics and field investigation there are 5 6 times of irrigation in the study area during the crop growth period every year the specified irrigation time during crop growing period is usually set as april 22th may 15th june 15th july 15th and august 15th under the present situation the study area is less affected by soil salinity because salts are leached to the deeper layer with intensive irrigation ren et al 2018a 2 2 problem statement in the whole crop growth period the groundwater table is generally in a downward trend due to the intense crop evapotranspiration in this case the capillary rising water replenishes the soil water in the root zone and groundwater consumption is greater than that from rainfall and irrigation it should be noted that when the groundwater table is too shallow crop growth is restrained by waterlogging and root anoxia problems moreover there is a close link between appropriate irrigation for these crops and groundwater depth in fact unbalanced relationship between water demands and supplies always exists in irrigated agriculture making the competition among three crops including spring wheat maize and sunflower become more intense similarly the study period spans the entire irrigated crop growing season which starts at the end of march and ends at the end of september therefore optimal irrigation planning that is to determine the irrigation amount at each irrigation time for different crops should involve the water balance simulation in arid and shallow groundwater areas in addition ambiguous information and subjective preference such as crop price cost of production and water availability different choices exist in the irrigation planning problems these fuzzy variables and parameters required to be addressed in the optimization model in summary developing a simulation optimization framework under fuzzy uncertainty is needed to figure out the variation of groundwater table and other related parameters and make appropriate strategies of irrigation planning 3 modeling framework the modeling framework is developed by integrating daily water balance simulation fuzzy credibility constrained programming and the hurwicz criterion into a general framework for irrigation planning see fig 2 it consists of the following sections 3 1 fuzzy credibility based optimization model with the hurwicz criterion in this study fuzzy credibility constrained programming is taken as the framework of optimization model fuzzy credibility constrained programming can be used to examine the satisfaction degree of constraints and system performance under fuzzy uncertainties existing in the single left hand side single right hand side and double sided of constraints thus based on the concept of credibility measure a general framework of fccp model are written as follows 1a max f j 1 n c j x j 1b c r j 1 n a i j x j b i α i i 1 2 m 1c x j 0 i 1 2 n where f is the objective function x x 1 x 2 x n is non fuzzy decision variables c j and a i j are real number coefficients b i is fuzzy coefficients α i is credibility level i is the number of constraints and j is the number of variables formula 1b represents that credibility of fuzzy event j 1 n a i j x j b i should be no less than predetermined credibility level α in practical applications fuzzy uncertainties may exist in the left hand side right hand side and double sided of constraints let fuzzy variables b i be a triangular fuzzy number b i b i 1 b i 2 b i 3 and t represent j 1 n a i j x j credibility measure can be presented in the above three cases according to liu and liu 2002 when the fuzzy variables exist in the right hand side of constraints the credibility measure is defined 1d c r t b i 1 if t b i 1 2 b i 2 b i 1 t 2 b i 2 b i 1 if b i 1 t b i 2 b i 3 t 2 b i 3 b i 2 if b i 2 t b i 3 0 if t b i 3 when the fuzzy variables exist in the left hand side of constraints the credibility measure is defined 1e c r b i t 0 if t b i 1 t b i 1 2 b i 2 b i 1 if b i 1 t b i 2 t b i 3 2 b i 2 2 b i 3 b i 2 if b i 2 t b i 3 1 if t b i 3 when the fuzzy variables exist in the double sided of constraints and triangular fuzzy number is expressed as t t 1 t 2 t 3 the credibility measure is defined 1f c r t b i 1 if t 3 b i 1 t 3 2 t 2 2 b i 2 b i 1 2 t 3 t 2 b i 2 b i 1 if t 2 b i 2 t 3 b 1 b i 3 t 1 2 b i 3 b i 2 t 2 t 1 if t 2 b i 2 t 1 b i 3 0 if t 1 b i 3 generally to make credibility be meaningful and acceptable in decision making the value should be greater than 0 5 to avoid ineffective decisions thus when credibility level is greater than 0 5 α 0 5 credibility measure can be reformulated into the following deterministic form that is 1g c r t b i α 2 b i 2 b i 1 t 2 b i 2 b i 1 α t 2 2 α b i 2 2 α 1 b i 1 1h c r b i t α t b i 3 2 b i 2 2 b i 3 b i 2 α t 2 α 1 b i 3 2 1 α b i 2 1i c r t b i α t 3 2 t 2 2 b i 2 b i 1 2 t 3 t 2 b i 2 b i 1 α 1 2 α t 3 2 α 1 t 2 2 α 1 b i 2 1 2 α b i 1 although the fccp method can deal with fuzzy uncertainties in the left hand and right hand sides of constraints separately and double sided of constraints it has difficulty in addressing uncertainties in the objective function and illustrating risk preference of decision makers namely all of the objective function values are following optimistic or pessimistic criteria therefore the hurwicz criterion is introduced to overcome the limitation and enhance the applicability of the fccp method its integrated form is written as follows 1j max f λ f o p t 1 λ f p e c subject to 1k c r j 1 n c j x j f o p t ξ 1l c r j 1 n c j x j f p e c ξ 1m c r j 1 n a i j x j b i α i i 1 2 m where λ 0 λ 1 is preference weight that is assigned to balance the tradeoff between optimistic criterion and pessimistic criterion which is predetermined by decision makers arising from subjective judgments it is expected to change preference weights to represent various criteria e g λ 0 denotes pessimistic criterion λ 0 5 denotes balanced criterion and λ 1 0 denotes optimistic criterion f is the objective function based upon the hurwicz criterion with a linear combination of optimistic criterion and pessimistic criterion and ξ represents credibility level to the objective function with optimistic criterion and pessimistic criterion which is able to illustrate relationships between satisfaction degree of constraints and system failure risk under two extreme criterions however this optimization model cannot show the variations of physical processes in irrigation planning 3 2 coupled simulation optimization framework under uncertainty for irrigation planning in this study the following problems will be involved and solved though coupled simulation optimization framework 1 how to achieve the maximum agricultural incomes from irrigation planning under fuzzy uncertainty 2 how to investigate the variation of groundwater table based on daily water balance simulation 3 how to generate irrigation planning strategies under different credibility levels and preference weights and 4 how to balance irrigation planning and risk preferences therefore to integrate the daily water balance simulation hurwicz criterion and fuzzy credibility based optimization model into a general framework of irrigation planning is a potential way to solve the above concerns thus a coupled simulation optimization framework is developed under uncertainty it is shown below 3 2 1 objective function 2a max f λ max f o p t 1 λ min f p e c 2b c r i 1 3 n b i a i y i i 1 3 a i c p i 10 i 1 3 t 1 175 c w i a i i w i t η s f o p t α 2c c r i 1 3 n

economic benefits under the hurwicz criterion that is used to balance the optimistic and pessimistic cases f o p t denotes objective function value under optimistic criterion indicating that the maximum payoff to each decision f p e c is the objective function value under pessimistic criterion which is related to the minimum payoff both are extreme cases and hurwicz criterion is fairly flexible by varying the value λ λ λ 0 1 is preference weight assigned to a selected value by decision makers which enables to reflect varying degrees of optimism eqs 2b and 2c mean that the credibility of fuzzy events related to f o p t and f p e c is not less than α α is credibility level that reflects the satisfaction degree of fuzzy event i 1 3 n b i a i y i i 1 3 a i c p i 10 i 1 3 t

the whole crop growth period starts from march 25th to september 15th a total of 175 days the above equations show that the hurwicz criterion can support flexible analysis between optimistic criterion

irrigated on the 52th 83th 113th and 144th day sunflower is irrigated on the 83th 113th and 144th day moreover it is assumed that the same crop has the same sowing and harvest date and irrigation time throughout the irrigation area the irrigation depth is assumed to be the same for the same crop in the study area in each irrigation round eq 2k denotes irrigation amount for each crop at each time is not more than 160 mm 3 2 2 2 soil water balance constraints in this study quantifying irrigation amount is a core component in irrigation planning which can be determined by daily soil water balance simulation during crop growth season it requires to compute balance relationships among irrigation water soil water and groundwater these components consist of precipitation p i t 1 irrigation i w i t

season table 2 presents the input parameters for solving the problem 4 results analysis and discussions three risk related parameters are used to examine the satisfaction levels of the objective function and constraints including nine preference weights λ 0 1 0 2 0 9 and three credibility levels α 0 7 0 8 and 0 9 β 0 7 0 8 and 0 9 thus a total of 81 sets of optimal solutions have been generated for supporting irrigation planning α denotes the satisfaction degree of the objective function while β represents the credibility level of the constraints of irrigation water availability moreover by involving daily soil water and groundwater balance simulation physical parameters associated with daily soil water content deep percolation and groundwater table can also be calculated therefore results of system benefits irrigation planning solutions and groundwater table will be analyzed and investigated under different scenarios 4 1 system benefits fig 4a and b show the optimistic and pessimistic benefits f o p t and f p e c under different preference weights and credibility levels in general preference weights are assigned to predefined values between the optimistic and pessimistic criterion to finally choose a composite option overall the optimistic results of agricultural returns present an increased trend when preference weight λ i is raised from 0 1 to 0 9 under each credibility level conversely the pessimistic results have an opposite trend regarding the variation of preference weights for example when λ i is raised from 0 1 to 0 9 the optimistic results would be slightly increased from 1 43 109 yuan to 1 75 109 yuan under credibility level α 0 7 and β 0 7 under the same circumstances the pessimistic results are slightly decreased from 1 30 109 yuan to 1 22 109 yuan this is mainly because preference weight represents optimistic attitude to make decision and the objective function be satisfied easily as it increases similarly the pessimistic benefits would be higher when preference weight is lower in this case pessimistic attitude dominates decision making therefore decision makers are suggested to choose a criterion that is a compromise between the optimistic and pessimistic criterion on the other hand the optimistic and pessimistic system benefits are also influenced by credibility levels α and β the outcomes show that both benefits are decreased when credibility level is raised from 0 7 to 0 9 for each preference weight this can be explained that credibility level is highly related with satisfaction degree of the objective function and constraints when the credibility level is raised satisfaction degree becomes greater than a lower credibility level which will directly affect the decision domain and system failure risk for example when β changes from 0 7 to 0 9 irrigation water availability becomes 761 7 106 m3 β 0 7 756 5 106 m3 β 0 8 and 751 3 106 m3 β 0 9 respectively meanwhile it can be seen that the optimistic outcomes are decreased from the maximum value of 1 75 109 yuan α 0 7 and β 0 7 to the minimum value of 1 25 109 yuan α 0 9 and β 0 9 likewise the pessimistic outcomes are decreased from 1 30 109 yuan α 0 7 and β 0 7 to 0 98 109 yuan α 0 9 and β 0 9 therefore in decision making pessimistic and optimistic returns represent the extreme situation of decision maker s risk preference by analyzing the extreme situation it is beneficial to quantify the pessimistic and optimistic decisions and balance risk preference and corresponding decisions fig 5 show the system benefits f λ f o p t 1 λ f p e c based on the hurwicz criterion under different preference weights and credibility levels which is a linear combination of optimistic and pessimistic benefits the preference weight λ i is assigned from 0 1 to 0 9 and thus the coefficient of pessimism is defined as 1 λ i on one hand system benefits present an increasing trend when preference weight is raised under different credibility levels for example under credibility level α 0 8 and β 0 8 system benefits have a slight growth from 1 25 109 yuan to 1 56 109 yuan with preference weight increases on the other hand system benefits are decreased with the credibility level rises from 0 7 to 0 9 similar explanations have been mentioned in the above content in fact system benefits based on the hurwicz criterion is a composite outcome that balance the optimistic and pessimistic to avoid the extreme decision extreme optimism is prone to the risk of system violation while extreme pessimism is prone to the risk of resource waste therefore it is meaningful to make a compromise between the optimistic and pessimistic criteria to make the risk of system benefits be moderate because extreme decisions will definitely increase the risk of decision making 4 2 irrigation planning solutions fig 6 presents optimal irrigation planning solutions for three crops under different credibility levels at preference weight λ 0 5 optimal solutions under nine credibility scenarios e g α 0 7 β 0 7 α 0 7 β 0 8 and α 0 7 β 0 9 will be examined and compared to reflect the variations in this study the planting time of three crops is overlapped in sequence fig 6 clearly shows that spring wheat maize and sunflower are irrigated three times four times and three times during crop growth season reflectively optimal solutions of irrigation planning mean that the amount of allocated irrigation water to three competing crops taking the same credibility level α and different β levels for comparison it is noted that results of spring wheat and sunflower during their irrigation time have little variation with β changes however solutions of maize are decreased at its fourth irrigation time which leads to a reduction in the total amount of irrigation for example under α 0 7 the allocated irrigation water to spring wheat is 155 mm 160 mm and 154 mm under β 0 7 0 8 and 0 9 while the allocate irrigation water to maize is 159 mm 130 mm 136 mm and 104 mm under β 0 7 159 mm 130 mm 136 mm and 97 mm under β 0 8 and 159 mm 130 mm 136 mm and 89 mm β 0 9 the total irrigation water during its crop growth period is 529 mm 522 mm and 515 mm under β 0 7 0 8 and 0 9 moreover considering different α levels from 0 7 to 0 9 spring wheat is going to be less irrigated in terms of the total amount of irrigation water and thus its crop yield is slightly decreased conversely solutions for maize is increased this can be further interpreted by the amount of irrigation water multiplied by the planting area that is although the allocated water for maize is raised under high α level the sum of irrigation water i e i 1 3 t 1 175 i w i t a i t including spring wheat maize and sunflower is reduced in fact the objective function is mostly hold as the credibility level α increases which is similar to the effect of credibility level β on the optimal solutions compared with optimal solutions at preference weight λ 0 5 figs 7 and 8 exhibit optimal solutions of irrigation planning under λ 0 1 and λ 0 9 the results indicate that preference weight has a smaller effect than credibility level on optimal irrigation planning solutions for instance under α 0 7 and β 0 7 total irrigation water for spring wheat is 469 mm 469 mm and 469 mm at preference weights λ 0 1 0 5 and 0 9 the total irrigation water for maize is 529 mm 529 mm and 529 mm and the total irrigation water for sunflower is 276 mm 276 mm and 276 mm respectively furthermore from λ 0 1 to λ 0 9 only two cases occurred under λ 0 3 and λ 0 7 are different from that under other cases this is because the compromised solutions have been generated due to the hurwicz criterion when preference weights are greater than 0 7 optimistic criterion will play a decisive role in optimal solutions conversely when preference weights are less than 0 3 pessimistic criterion dominates the generation of optimal solutions therefore by integrating the hurwicz criterion decision makers can balance irrigation planning solutions and risk preference based on varying assigned preference weights 4 3 groundwater depth identifying appropriate groundwater table and mitigating negative effects on crop growth are critical to increase crop yield and reduce risks of soil salinization in shallow groundwater regions in this study there is an assumption that groundwater flows laterally among three planted crops so that when a certain crop is irrigated the groundwater level is redistributed fig 9 presents the variation of daily groundwater depth during the whole crop growth period under α 0 7 β 0 7 and λ 0 1 0 9 these results indicate that groundwater depth fluctuates frequently during the crop growth period which are directly linked with irrigation planning solutions by soil water balance and groundwater balance simulation groundwater level is normally fluctuated after each irrigation activity especially in the third fourth and fifth times of irrigation despite the same initial groundwater level is given the maximum and the minimum groundwater depth is different among preference weights ranging from λ 0 1 to λ 0 9 for example in the cases of λ 0 1 0 2 0 4 0 5 0 6 and 0 8 groundwater depth becomes zero after the third irrigation time due to irrigation induced deep percolation this is because all the crops are irrigated at this time which thereby leads to much more irrigation water being applied to the field generally deep percolation happens when a heavy rainfall and irrigation thus obtained results can reflect practical conditions in irrigation planning furthermore the maximized groundwater depth occurs i e 1 82 m before the second irrigation time in some special cases such as λ 0 3 0 7 and 0 9 the maximized groundwater level appears at the end of crop growth period i e 1 93 m 2 26 m and 1 87 m moreover the mean value of groundwater depth during the whole crop growth period is 1 234 m λ 0 1 1 234 m λ 0 2 1 323 m λ 0 3 1 234 m λ 0 4 1 234 m λ 0 5 1 234 m λ 0 6 1 611 m λ 0 7 1 234 m λ 0 8 and 1 301 m λ 0 9 respectively previous studies show that it will apparently affect capillary rise and then its role in crop growth can be ignored when groundwater depth exceeds 2 5 m hao et al 2014 ren et al 2018a in this study it has been proved that groundwater based evaporation plays a non negligible effect on crop growth because daily groundwater depth is lower than 2 m in most cases therefore the obtained results can support in depth analysis between optimal irrigation planning strategies and reasonable groundwater depth taking λ 0 5 as an example fig 10 illustrates the influence of different credibility levels α and β on groundwater depth under the same credibility level like α 0 7 the difference lies in the amount of irrigation water in the fifth irrigation the results show that groundwater depth is 1 06 m 1 12 m and 1 18 m under β 0 7 β 0 8 and β 0 9 after the fifth irrigation and groundwater depth at the end of crop growth period is 1 67 m 1 70 m and 1 72 m under α 0 7 and 0 8 it is obvious that there are five peak points i e the phenomena of shortly but quickly rise regarding groundwater table corresponding to their total irrigation times while four peak points exist in few cases under α 0 9 it can also be seen that the maximized groundwater depth appears before the second irrigation time this is because only spring wheat is irrigated in the first irrigation time and continuous soil evaporation arises from large portion of maize and bare soil for planting sunflower thereby leading to decline of groundwater table furthermore other related elements including daily soil water content irrigation induced percolation and crop yield have also been estimated based on water balance model therefore knowing the relationships among these physical parameters based on soil water balance and groundwater balance simulation is crucial to understand the variations of groundwater level and its effect on crop growth in shallow groundwater areas the above results illustrate the usefulness of the developed framework that integrates concept of the hurwicz criterion and water balance simulation into this study 4 4 discussions since the hurwicz criterion is integrated into the proposed optimization model a meaningful discussion associated with preference weights is necessary to better understand tradeoffs of risk preference between optimistic criterion and pessimistic criterion it is capable of dealing with fuzzy uncertainties and human induced judgments in practical applications the fundamental concept of preference weight is that it can measure decision makers risk preference degree of fuzzy events and quantify a certain percentage weight of balancing optimism and pessimism which can subjectively denote the optimism degree and acceptable risk level theoretical finding is that all three criterion including the minimax i e the best possible the minimin i e the worst possible and the hurwicz criterion are proposed from a single framework based on the loss function when facing adjustment problems arnold et al 2002 therefore the hurwicz criterion has capability for representing different criteria by changing preference weights when λ 0 it becomes the pessimistic criterion when λ 1 it totally becomes the optimistic criterion table 3 presents system benefits under the optimistic criterion the pessimistic criterion and the hurwicz criterion under different credibility levels λ 0 1 0 the results indicate that they are extreme criteria representing total optimism and pessimism therefore the hurwicz criterion is used to overcome these extreme cases and attempt to neutralized them and thus generate more flexible solutions in a more general manner by calculating each solution s weighed averaged return with such a linear combination the best return is regarded as the potentially chosen decision sheng et al 2013 rational decision makers are willing to take adaptive strategies to balance risk preferences and their progressive or conservative attitudes system benefits resulting from each credibility level and weight preferences are statistically analyzed by kruskal wallis test however results present no significant differences in different credibility levels which means that the system benefits of different credibility levels show consistency for all the credibility levels moreover to identify the effects of factors including credibility level α and β and preference weight λ on optimal outcomes factorial analysis method is adopted montgomery and runger 2010 through this method the variations of responses under different combinations can be simulated and investigated to compare variations of system benefits eight scenarios based on extreme values of credibility level α and β and preference weight λ are arranged in table 4 such a 23 design can denote the low and high levels of the factors α β and λ by the signs and respectively the effects of interest in the 23 design are the main effects α β and λ and their two factor interaction αβ αλ and βλ three factor interaction αβλ normally information on the main effects and low order interactions is more useful therefore the effect estimates can be calculated from s e contrast 2 k 1 and s s contrast 2 2 k where se is the standardized effect of each factor or multi factor interaction montgomery and runger 2010 zeng et al 2014 contrast is calculated by using plus and minus signs in each column it is determined by multiplying the combinations in the last column in table 4 by the signs in the corresponding main effect or interaction column by summing these results to obtain a contrast ss is the sum of squares of each factor k is types of factors and k 3 in this study therefore significant factors and their interactions can be identified the results indicate that preference weight λ has the largest effect accounting for 79 8 in effecting system s performance while credibility level α accounts for 18 5 the above analysis shows that preference weight is the most significant factor which should be decided carefully to integrate more implicit knowledge in decision making another point is to discuss what the effect of initial groundwater depth and soil water content on the results this is crucial to examine and reflect the role of soil water balance and groundwater balance simulation in the optimal solution for example taking three risk related parameters as α 0 7 β 0 7 and λ 0 5 seven scenarios of initial groundwater depth h 0 0 4 m 0 6 m 0 8 m 1 0 m 1 2 m and 1 4 m and 1 6 m are provided when initial soil water content is kept as θ 0 0 20 through solving the developed model optimal results are obtained it is noted that system benefits are decreased with groundwater depth increases from 1 464 109 yuan h 0 0 4 m to 1 092 109 yuan h 0 1 6 m this shows that groundwater plays a positive role in crop growth with shallower groundwater depth because the water storage in root zone can temporarily accommodate excessive applied water i e irrigation water and rainfall and thus be readily re evaporated by capillary rise for supporting crop evapotranspiration ren et al 2018b in detail a lower groundwater depth makes capillary rise of groundwater increase and thus efficiently supplement crop water consumptions without considering root zone salt accumulation under the current condition the fields are basically unaffected by soil salinity in both years because salts are leached to the deeper layer due to excessive irrigation ren et al 2018a similarly seven initial soil water contents i e 0 14 0 16 0 18 0 20 0 22 and 0 24 0 26 are presented for comparison when initial groundwater depth is set as 0 8 m the trend of optimal system benefits is raised from 1 334 109 yuan θ 0 0 14 to 1 492 109 yuan θ 0 0 26 this can be explained by irrigation planning solutions generally a lower soil water content leads to a higher water stress coefficient and thus brings more reduction of crop yield therefore variations of physical parameters can be illustrated though daily water balance equation involved in the optimization model thereby making reasonable solutions of irrigation planning to clearly understand the impact of soil water content and groundwater depth on crop growth in such a shallow groundwater region 5 conclusions a simulation optimization framework under fuzzy uncertainty is developed for irrigation planning which is the integration of fuzzy credibility based optimization model with the hurwicz criterion and daily water balance simulation afterward a case study on irrigation planning in the jiefangzha irrigation subarea in the hetao irrigation district northwest china has been provided to demonstrate its applicability therefore regarding the application of framework the following conclusions can be made 1 higher credibility levels and lower preference weights make lower benefits but lead to higher reliability levels due to more stringent constraints 2 the hurwicz criterion can provide flexible and balanced decisions to avoid extreme solutions considering preference weights 3 daily interactions among irrigation water soil water and groundwater can be illustrated by water balance simulation 4 tradeoffs between risk preference of decision makers and irrigation planning solutions can be balanced 5 preference weight plays a significant role in effecting the system performance the developed framework can be employed by government management agencies to generate decision solutions regarding field or regional irrigation planning to allocate irrigation to each crop under different scenarios furthermore this framework can be incorporated into a portable decision support system to assist in their decision analysis for example they can test their risk preferences on irrigation planning by varying preference weights to identify the most suitable solution for practical conditions among the different scenarios moreover it should integrate other methods e g remote sensing techniques aspects of soil salinity and soil evaporation into coupled optimization simulation framework to solve more complex irrigation planning problems and provide more references for decision makers declaration of competing interest the

10020,the challenge of irrigation planning is that it involves various system components which is further exacerbated by uncertainties and risk preference in making decisions this study presents a simulation optimization framework under uncertainty by incorporating fuzzy credibility based optimization model with the hurwicz criterion and daily water balance simulation for irrigation planning the developed methodology can effectively handle fuzzy uncertainty in the objective function and constraints and readily analyze tradeoffs between optimal solutions of irrigation planning and risks associated with the decision makers preferences it can also derive several physical parameters expressed as water depth from the water balance of root zone for determining optimal irrigation water amount the hurwicz criterion fuzzy credibility constraints and other irrigation related constraints are imposed on the study system through the developed framework then its applicability is illustrated with a real case study in the jiefangzha irrigation subarea in the hetao irrigation district northwest china which is an arid area optimal results using three risk related parameters i e nine preference weights λ 0 1 0 2 and 0 9 of objective function and three credibility levels α 0 7 0 8 and 0 9 β 0 7 0 8 and 0 9 of fuzzy constraints have been generated for supporting irrigation planning based on these outcomes system benefits resulting from agricultural production have a slight growth with preference weights increase from 0 1 to 0 9 showing that optimistic criterion plays a decisive role in optimal irrigation planning solutions especially when preference weights are greater than 0 7 daily groundwater depth is presented in the given 81 scenarios for comparison showing the usefulness of the developed framework in practical applications therefore these findings are helpful for supporting irrigation planning and balancing tradeoffs between irrigation planning and risk preference for sustainable irrigated agriculture keywords irrigation planning fuzzy programming simulation optimization framework hurwicz criterion risk preference 1 introduction implementing a reasonable irrigation planning for optimal irrigation water allocation is crucial to improve water use efficiency and alleviate water shortages in arid and semiarid areas meanwhile various uncertain factors e g available water and land resources hydro meteorological information and crop parameters economic implications environmental standards and requirements and subjective preferences policy choices and their interactions render the irrigation planning problems more complicated for instance policy choices result in market fluctuations and changes in crop prices and thus farmers incentives to cultivate a particular crop may also be motivated affecting the planting area of crops environmental standards may be different when the strictest or intermediate ones are adopted these environmental regulations are directly linked with irrigation planning when considering water quality problems arisen from irrigation induced agricultural non point source pollution generally these factors are considered as the source of uncertainty because they are hardly quantified and impossible to be fully controllable thus considerable attention has been put into the problem of irrigation planning based on optimization modeling under uncertainty cai and rosegrant 2004 maqsood et al 2005 regulwar and gurav 2011 singh 2014 li et al 2016 2019 zhang et al 2019 generally three types of inexact optimization methods including interval linear programming ilp fuzzy mathematical programming fmp and stochastic mathematical programming smp are developed to deal with interval fuzzy and stochastic uncertainties respectively among them interval based method i e interval linear parameter programming can tackle interval parameters with unknown distribution information while it s incapable of solving problems of the violated constraints huang 1998 yang et al 2016 smp methods include two stage multi stage stochastic programming chance constrained programming and joint probabilistic programming which can deal with probabilistic uncertainty and provide explicit solutions with known distribution information while it s usually hindered by data requirement in the case of less historical data wen and iwamura 2008 xu and qin 2010 zhang et al 2018 2019 in contrast fmp has multiple methods for dealing with fuzzy variables such as fuzzy chance constrained programming fuzzy possibilistic programming and fuzzy flexible programming which can generate flexible solutions with less data requirements in a fuzzy environment liu and iwamura 1998 zhang et al 2009 ghahremani nahr et al 2019 in practice there are some imprecise information ambiguous statements and subjective human thinking in irrigation planning for example the price of maize is not less than 1 6 yuan kg and the risk level of water shortage is pretty high thus using fmp method to effectively solve irrigation planning problems is a potential option as credibility measure is self dual and its computation procedure is more efficient when the constraints are satisfied at credibility level with an allowable violation risk level shiraz et al 2017 accordingly fuzzy credibility constrained programming fccp method has been developed and used in various fields which is based on the concept of credibility measure initiated by liu and liu 2002 this method is proved to be effective for dealing with fuzzy parameters and violation constraints by transforming them into deterministic ones at each predetermined credibility level zhang et al 2012 however fccp method has difficulty in tackling uncertainties existing in the objective function and it cannot reflect risk preference of decision makers in general decision makers are expected to have different risk preferences e g optimistic or pessimistic attitudes to tackle uncertainty before management strategies are implemented an effective measure hurwicz criterion is introduced to address fuzzy uncertainty in the objective function and balance risk preference between optimistic criterion and pessimistic criterion lau et al 2010 the optimistic criterion is expected to always choose the best payoffs or least costs which is suitable for the adventurous decision makers pursuing high payoffs or low costs while the pessimistic criterion has an opposite implication that decision makers choose the minimum payoffs or maximum losses which appeals to the decision makers who are conservative to ensure their payoffs in an unfavorable way it is noted that both above mentioned criterions are extreme cases in fact making decisions based on a composite value derived from preference weights from optimistic to pessimistic criterion is desired to realize an appropriate compromise between the above two criterions which is called the hurwicz criterion hurwicz 1951 when preference weights are assigned to different values ranging from 0 to 1 0 the related scenarios can be generated to flexibly illustrate the risk preferences of decision makers for example lau et al 2010 proposed a fuzzy location model with the hurwicz criterion for optimal system design in e commerce zeng et al 2014 developed a two stage credibility constrained programming with the hurwicz criterion approach for water resources management in a typical arid region i e kaidu kongque river basin and water allocation patterns corresponding to risk options of decision makers e g adventurous or conservative preferences were generated nevertheless optimization model can provide the answer of what is best under some restrictive conditions and usually simply physical components such as irrigation soil water and groundwater moreover there is a frequently quantitative feedback among irrigation soil water movement in the crop root zone and groundwater aquifers which requires to consider physical process simulations for soil water and groundwater balance therefore to develop simulation optimization framework by integrating optimization model and daily water balance simulation is a promising strategy for making optimal irrigation planning for example georgiou and papamichail 2008 developed a nonlinear programming optimization model with an integrated soil water balance for optimal irrigation water allocation and crop planning singh 2010 used one dimensional simulation model to study on farm irrigation water management plans jiang et al 2016 presented a process based irrigation water management model through integration of two level optimization model and distributed agro hydrological model wang and guo 2021 proposed an inexact optimization framework considering regional agro hydrological process for irrigation water management under uncertainty these studies give insight into potential management strategies for irrigation planning by integrating agro hydrological process simulation however few studies were implemented previously on irrigation planning incorporated with the hurwicz criterion in irrigated agriculture therefore as the extensions of previous studies the primary objective of this study is to develop a simulation optimization framework under uncertainty for supporting irrigation planning that is fuzzy credibility constrained optimization model with the hurwicz criterion considering daily water balance simulation it has the following advantages in 1 effectively tackling fuzzy uncertainty in the objective function and double sided constraints and risk preference arisen from decision makers subjective attitudes 2 clearly illustrating daily variations of simulated physical parameters 3 readily generating flexible solutions of irrigation planning under different credibility levels and preference weights and 4 quantitatively balancing tradeoff between irrigation planning and risk preference of decision makers then the developed framework is applied to a case study in the jiefangzha irrigation subarea in the hid the upper reaches of the yellow river basin for optimal irrigation planning it is expected to identify appropriate management plans based on simulation optimization framework through giving several preference weights and credibility levels therefore the results can provide basis of irrigation planning and risk management under uncertainty in irrigated agriculture 2 the study system 2 1 the study area the hetao irrigation district hid is located in the upper reaches of the yellow river which covers a total area of 1120 000 ha and its arable area is 570 000 ha because it s labeled as an arid climate zone with less precipitation and large evaporation thus irrigation is the necessary measure for agricultural production which primarily rely on the yellow river water ren et al 2018a intensive and excessive water diversions for agricultural irrigation brings on waterlogging problems horizontal seepage from the multiple canals and percolation losses in the irrigated farmland also recharge the groundwater and result in the rising of groundwater table xu et al 2010 all of these factors thereby have led to shallow groundwater table in the irrigation area with an annual variation range of 0 5 3 0 m pereira et al 2007 the jiefangzha irrigation subarea is selected as the study area where is the second largest irrigation subarea in the hid fig 1 the study area has a total area of 215 700 ha and cultivated area accounts for nearly 66 in addition it is flat and the groundwater hydraulic gradient is low 0 02 the average annual precipitation is 155 mm with over 70 from july to september but annual evapotranspiration is approximately 2000 mm the main crops include maize sunflower spring wheat accounting for more than 85 of the total planting area different crops have different irrigation schedule because of their own growth cycle and characteristics there is partial overlap of growth period among these three crops table 1 shows crop growth stages and calendar of the study area for example spring wheat is sowed in late march 3 25 and harvested in the middle of july 7 14 surface basin irrigation is the mostly used irrigation method through multi level canal systems according to the statistics and field investigation there are 5 6 times of irrigation in the study area during the crop growth period every year the specified irrigation time during crop growing period is usually set as april 22th may 15th june 15th july 15th and august 15th under the present situation the study area is less affected by soil salinity because salts are leached to the deeper layer with intensive irrigation ren et al 2018a 2 2 problem statement in the whole crop growth period the groundwater table is generally in a downward trend due to the intense crop evapotranspiration in this case the capillary rising water replenishes the soil water in the root zone and groundwater consumption is greater than that from rainfall and irrigation it should be noted that when the groundwater table is too shallow crop growth is restrained by waterlogging and root anoxia problems moreover there is a close link between appropriate irrigation for these crops and groundwater depth in fact unbalanced relationship between water demands and supplies always exists in irrigated agriculture making the competition among three crops including spring wheat maize and sunflower become more intense similarly the study period spans the entire irrigated crop growing season which starts at the end of march and ends at the end of september therefore optimal irrigation planning that is to determine the irrigation amount at each irrigation time for different crops should involve the water balance simulation in arid and shallow groundwater areas in addition ambiguous information and subjective preference such as crop price cost of production and water availability different choices exist in the irrigation planning problems these fuzzy variables and parameters required to be addressed in the optimization model in summary developing a simulation optimization framework under fuzzy uncertainty is needed to figure out the variation of groundwater table and other related parameters and make appropriate strategies of irrigation planning 3 modeling framework the modeling framework is developed by integrating daily water balance simulation fuzzy credibility constrained programming and the hurwicz criterion into a general framework for irrigation planning see fig 2 it consists of the following sections 3 1 fuzzy credibility based optimization model with the hurwicz criterion in this study fuzzy credibility constrained programming is taken as the framework of optimization model fuzzy credibility constrained programming can be used to examine the satisfaction degree of constraints and system performance under fuzzy uncertainties existing in the single left hand side single right hand side and double sided of constraints thus based on the concept of credibility measure a general framework of fccp model are written as follows 1a max f j 1 n c j x j 1b c r j 1 n a i j x j b i α i i 1 2 m 1c x j 0 i 1 2 n where f is the objective function x x 1 x 2 x n is non fuzzy decision variables c j and a i j are real number coefficients b i is fuzzy coefficients α i is credibility level i is the number of constraints and j is the number of variables formula 1b represents that credibility of fuzzy event j 1 n a i j x j b i should be no less than predetermined credibility level α in practical applications fuzzy uncertainties may exist in the left hand side right hand side and double sided of constraints let fuzzy variables b i be a triangular fuzzy number b i b i 1 b i 2 b i 3 and t represent j 1 n a i j x j credibility measure can be presented in the above three cases according to liu and liu 2002 when the fuzzy variables exist in the right hand side of constraints the credibility measure is defined 1d c r t b i 1 if t b i 1 2 b i 2 b i 1 t 2 b i 2 b i 1 if b i 1 t b i 2 b i 3 t 2 b i 3 b i 2 if b i 2 t b i 3 0 if t b i 3 when the fuzzy variables exist in the left hand side of constraints the credibility measure is defined 1e c r b i t 0 if t b i 1 t b i 1 2 b i 2 b i 1 if b i 1 t b i 2 t b i 3 2 b i 2 2 b i 3 b i 2 if b i 2 t b i 3 1 if t b i 3 when the fuzzy variables exist in the double sided of constraints and triangular fuzzy number is expressed as t t 1 t 2 t 3 the credibility measure is defined 1f c r t b i 1 if t 3 b i 1 t 3 2 t 2 2 b i 2 b i 1 2 t 3 t 2 b i 2 b i 1 if t 2 b i 2 t 3 b 1 b i 3 t 1 2 b i 3 b i 2 t 2 t 1 if t 2 b i 2 t 1 b i 3 0 if t 1 b i 3 generally to make credibility be meaningful and acceptable in decision making the value should be greater than 0 5 to avoid ineffective decisions thus when credibility level is greater than 0 5 α 0 5 credibility measure can be reformulated into the following deterministic form that is 1g c r t b i α 2 b i 2 b i 1 t 2 b i 2 b i 1 α t 2 2 α b i 2 2 α 1 b i 1 1h c r b i t α t b i 3 2 b i 2 2 b i 3 b i 2 α t 2 α 1 b i 3 2 1 α b i 2 1i c r t b i α t 3 2 t 2 2 b i 2 b i 1 2 t 3 t 2 b i 2 b i 1 α 1 2 α t 3 2 α 1 t 2 2 α 1 b i 2 1 2 α b i 1 although the fccp method can deal with fuzzy uncertainties in the left hand and right hand sides of constraints separately and double sided of constraints it has difficulty in addressing uncertainties in the objective function and illustrating risk preference of decision makers namely all of the objective function values are following optimistic or pessimistic criteria therefore the hurwicz criterion is introduced to overcome the limitation and enhance the applicability of the fccp method its integrated form is written as follows 1j max f λ f o p t 1 λ f p e c subject to 1k c r j 1 n c j x j f o p t ξ 1l c r j 1 n c j x j f p e c ξ 1m c r j 1 n a i j x j b i α i i 1 2 m where λ 0 λ 1 is preference weight that is assigned to balance the tradeoff between optimistic criterion and pessimistic criterion which is predetermined by decision makers arising from subjective judgments it is expected to change preference weights to represent various criteria e g λ 0 denotes pessimistic criterion λ 0 5 denotes balanced criterion and λ 1 0 denotes optimistic criterion f is the objective function based upon the hurwicz criterion with a linear combination of optimistic criterion and pessimistic criterion and ξ represents credibility level to the objective function with optimistic criterion and pessimistic criterion which is able to illustrate relationships between satisfaction degree of constraints and system failure risk under two extreme criterions however this optimization model cannot show the variations of physical processes in irrigation planning 3 2 coupled simulation optimization framework under uncertainty for irrigation planning in this study the following problems will be involved and solved though coupled simulation optimization framework 1 how to achieve the maximum agricultural incomes from irrigation planning under fuzzy uncertainty 2 how to investigate the variation of groundwater table based on daily water balance simulation 3 how to generate irrigation planning strategies under different credibility levels and preference weights and 4 how to balance irrigation planning and risk preferences therefore to integrate the daily water balance simulation hurwicz criterion and fuzzy credibility based optimization model into a general framework of irrigation planning is a potential way to solve the above concerns thus a coupled simulation optimization framework is developed under uncertainty it is shown below 3 2 1 objective function 2a max f λ max f o p t 1 λ min f p e c 2b c r i 1 3 n b i a i y i i 1 3 a i c p i 10 i 1 3 t 1 175 c w i a i i w i t η s f o p t α 2c c r i 1 3 n

flexible by varying the value λ λ λ 0 1 is preference weight assigned to a selected value by decision makers which enables to reflect varying degrees of optimism eqs 2b and 2c mean that the

the whole crop growth period starts from march 25th to september 15th a total of 175 days the above equations show that the hurwicz criterion can support flexible analysis between optimistic criterion

not more than 160 mm 3 2 2 2 soil water balance constraints in this study quantifying irrigation amount is a core component in irrigation planning which can be determined by daily soil water balance

initial groundwater table m h p i t is adjusted daily groundwater table m which is computed by weighting that of spring wheat maize and sunflower based on the fraction of planted area of each crop λ 1

groundwater table of each crop μ is the specific yield μ 0 07 3 2 2 4 soil water content constraints 2u θ w p θ i t θ f c i t this means that soil water content of each crop and every day fluctuates

season table 2 presents the input parameters for solving the problem 4 results analysis and discussions three risk related parameters are used to examine the satisfaction levels of the objective function and constraints including nine preference weights λ 0 1 0 2 0 9 and three credibility levels α 0 7 0 8 and 0 9 β 0 7 0 8 and 0 9 thus a total of 81 sets of optimal solutions have been generated for supporting irrigation planning α denotes the satisfaction degree of the objective function while β represents the credibility level of the constraints of irrigation water availability moreover by involving daily soil water and groundwater balance simulation physical parameters associated with daily soil water content deep percolation and groundwater table can also be calculated therefore results of system benefits irrigation planning solutions and groundwater table will be analyzed and investigated under different scenarios 4 1 system benefits fig 4a and b show the optimistic and pessimistic benefits f o p t and f p e c under different preference weights and credibility levels in general preference weights are assigned to predefined values between the optimistic and pessimistic criterion to finally choose a composite option overall the optimistic results of agricultural returns present an increased trend when preference weight λ i is raised from 0 1 to 0 9 under each credibility level conversely the pessimistic results have an opposite trend regarding the variation of preference weights for example when λ i is raised from 0 1 to 0 9 the optimistic results would be slightly increased from 1 43 109 yuan to 1 75 109 yuan under credibility level α 0 7 and β 0 7 under the same circumstances the pessimistic results are slightly decreased from 1 30 109 yuan to 1 22 109 yuan this is mainly because preference weight represents optimistic attitude to make decision and the objective function be satisfied easily as it increases similarly the pessimistic benefits would be higher when preference weight is lower in this case pessimistic attitude dominates decision making therefore decision makers are suggested to choose a criterion that is a compromise between the optimistic and pessimistic criterion on the other hand the optimistic and pessimistic system benefits are also influenced by credibility levels α and β the outcomes show that both benefits are decreased when credibility level is raised from 0 7 to 0 9 for each preference weight this can be explained that credibility level is highly related with satisfaction degree of the objective function and constraints when the credibility level is raised satisfaction degree becomes greater than a lower credibility level which will directly affect the decision domain and system failure risk for example when β changes from 0 7 to 0 9 irrigation water availability becomes 761 7 106 m3 β 0 7 756 5 106 m3 β 0 8 and 751 3 106 m3 β 0 9 respectively meanwhile it can be seen that the optimistic outcomes are decreased from the maximum value of 1 75 109 yuan α 0 7 and β 0 7 to the minimum value of 1 25 109 yuan α 0 9 and β 0 9 likewise the pessimistic outcomes are decreased from 1 30 109 yuan α 0 7 and β 0 7 to 0 98 109 yuan α 0 9 and β 0 9 therefore in decision making pessimistic and optimistic returns represent the extreme situation of decision maker s risk preference by analyzing the extreme situation it is beneficial to quantify the pessimistic and optimistic decisions and balance risk preference and corresponding decisions fig 5 show the system benefits f λ f o p t 1 λ f p e c based on the hurwicz criterion under different preference weights and credibility levels which is a linear combination of optimistic and pessimistic benefits the preference weight λ i is assigned from 0 1 to 0 9 and thus the coefficient of pessimism is defined as 1 λ i on one hand system benefits present an increasing trend when preference weight is raised under different credibility levels for example under credibility level α 0 8 and β 0 8 system benefits have a slight growth from 1 25 109 yuan to 1 56 109 yuan with preference weight increases on the other hand system benefits are decreased with the credibility level rises from 0 7 to 0 9 similar explanations have been mentioned in the above content in fact system benefits based on the hurwicz criterion is a composite outcome that balance the optimistic and pessimistic to avoid the extreme decision extreme optimism is prone to the risk of system violation while extreme pessimism is prone to the risk of resource waste therefore it is meaningful to make a compromise between the optimistic and pessimistic criteria to make the risk of system benefits be moderate because extreme decisions will definitely increase the risk of decision making 4 2 irrigation planning solutions fig 6 presents optimal irrigation planning solutions for three crops under different credibility levels at preference weight λ 0 5 optimal solutions under nine credibility scenarios e g α 0 7 β 0 7 α 0 7 β 0 8 and α 0 7 β 0 9 will be examined and compared to reflect the variations in this study the planting time of three crops is overlapped in sequence fig 6 clearly shows that spring wheat maize and sunflower are irrigated three times four times and three times during crop growth season reflectively optimal solutions of irrigation planning mean that the amount of allocated irrigation water to three competing crops taking the same credibility level α and different β levels for comparison it is noted that results of spring wheat and sunflower during their irrigation time have little variation with β changes however solutions of maize are decreased at its fourth irrigation time which leads to a reduction in the total amount of irrigation for example under α 0 7 the allocated irrigation water to spring wheat is 155 mm 160 mm and 154 mm under β 0 7 0 8 and 0 9 while the allocate irrigation water to maize is 159 mm 130 mm 136 mm and 104 mm under β 0 7 159 mm 130 mm 136 mm and 97 mm under β 0 8 and 159 mm 130 mm 136 mm and 89 mm β 0 9 the total irrigation water during its crop growth period is 529 mm 522 mm and 515 mm under β 0 7 0 8 and 0 9 moreover considering different α levels from 0 7 to 0 9 spring wheat is going to be less irrigated in terms of the total amount of irrigation water and thus its crop yield is slightly decreased conversely solutions for maize is increased this can be further interpreted by the amount of irrigation water multiplied by the planting area that is although the allocated water for maize is raised under high α level the sum of irrigation water i e i 1 3 t 1 175 i w i t a i t including spring wheat maize and sunflower is reduced in fact the objective function is mostly hold as the credibility level α increases which is similar to the effect of credibility level β on the optimal solutions compared with optimal solutions at preference weight λ 0 5 figs 7 and 8 exhibit optimal solutions of irrigation planning under λ 0 1 and λ 0 9 the results indicate that preference weight has a smaller effect than credibility level on optimal irrigation planning solutions for instance under α 0 7 and β 0 7 total irrigation water for spring wheat is 469 mm 469 mm and 469 mm at preference weights λ 0 1 0 5 and 0 9 the total irrigation water for maize is 529 mm 529 mm and 529 mm and the total irrigation water for sunflower is 276 mm 276 mm and 276 mm respectively furthermore from λ 0 1 to λ 0 9 only two cases occurred under λ 0 3 and λ 0 7 are different from that under other cases this is because the compromised solutions have been generated due to the hurwicz criterion when preference weights are greater than 0 7 optimistic criterion will play a decisive role in optimal solutions conversely when preference weights are less than 0 3 pessimistic criterion dominates the generation of optimal solutions therefore by integrating the hurwicz criterion decision makers can balance irrigation planning solutions and risk preference based on varying assigned preference weights 4 3 groundwater depth identifying appropriate groundwater table and mitigating negative effects on crop growth are critical to increase crop yield and reduce risks of soil salinization in shallow groundwater regions in this study there is an assumption that groundwater flows laterally among three planted crops so that when a certain crop is irrigated the groundwater level is redistributed fig 9 presents the variation of daily groundwater depth during the whole crop growth period under α 0 7 β 0 7 and λ 0 1 0 9 these results indicate that groundwater depth fluctuates frequently during the crop growth period which are directly linked with irrigation planning solutions by soil water balance and groundwater balance simulation groundwater level is normally fluctuated after each irrigation activity especially in the third fourth and fifth times of irrigation despite the same initial groundwater level is given the maximum and the minimum groundwater depth is different among preference weights ranging from λ 0 1 to λ 0 9 for example in the cases of λ 0 1 0 2 0 4 0 5 0 6 and 0 8 groundwater depth becomes zero after the third irrigation time due to irrigation induced deep percolation this is because all the crops are irrigated at this time which thereby leads to much more irrigation water being applied to the field generally deep percolation happens when a heavy rainfall and irrigation thus obtained results can reflect practical conditions in irrigation planning furthermore the maximized groundwater depth occurs i e 1 82 m before the second irrigation time in some special cases such as λ 0 3 0 7 and 0 9 the maximized groundwater level appears at the end of crop growth period i e 1 93 m 2 26 m and 1 87 m moreover the mean value of groundwater depth during the whole crop growth period is 1 234 m λ 0 1 1 234 m λ 0 2 1 323 m λ 0 3 1 234 m λ 0 4 1 234 m λ 0 5 1 234 m λ 0 6 1 611 m λ 0 7 1 234 m λ 0 8 and 1 301 m λ 0 9 respectively previous studies show that it will apparently affect capillary rise and then its role in crop growth can be ignored when groundwater depth exceeds 2 5 m hao et al 2014 ren et al 2018a in this study it has been proved that groundwater based evaporation plays a non negligible effect on crop growth because daily groundwater depth is lower than 2 m in most cases therefore the obtained results can support in depth analysis between optimal irrigation planning strategies and reasonable groundwater depth taking λ 0 5 as an example fig 10 illustrates the influence of different credibility levels α and β on groundwater depth under the same credibility level like α 0 7 the difference lies in the amount of irrigation water in the fifth irrigation the results show that groundwater depth is 1 06 m 1 12 m and 1 18 m under β 0 7 β 0 8 and β 0 9 after the fifth irrigation and groundwater depth at the end of crop growth period is 1 67 m 1 70 m and 1 72 m under α 0 7 and 0 8 it is obvious that there are five peak points i e the phenomena of shortly but quickly rise regarding groundwater table corresponding to their total irrigation times while four peak points exist in few cases under α 0 9 it can also be seen that the maximized groundwater depth appears before the second irrigation time this is because only spring wheat is irrigated in the first irrigation time and continuous soil evaporation arises from large portion of maize and bare soil for planting sunflower thereby leading to decline of groundwater table furthermore other related elements including daily soil water content irrigation induced percolation and crop yield have also been estimated based on water balance model therefore knowing the relationships among these physical parameters based on soil water balance and groundwater balance simulation is crucial to understand the variations of groundwater level and its effect on crop growth in shallow groundwater areas the above results illustrate the usefulness of the developed framework that integrates concept of the hurwicz criterion and water balance simulation into this study 4 4 discussions since the hurwicz criterion is integrated into the proposed optimization model a meaningful discussion associated with preference weights is necessary to better understand tradeoffs of risk preference between optimistic criterion and pessimistic criterion it is capable of dealing with fuzzy uncertainties and human induced judgments in practical applications the fundamental concept of preference weight is that it can measure decision makers risk preference degree of fuzzy events and quantify a certain percentage weight of balancing optimism and pessimism which can subjectively denote the optimism degree and acceptable risk level theoretical finding is that all three criterion including the minimax i e the best possible the minimin i e the worst possible and the hurwicz criterion are proposed from a single framework based on the loss function when facing adjustment problems arnold et al 2002 therefore the hurwicz criterion has capability for representing different criteria by changing preference weights when λ 0 it becomes the pessimistic criterion when λ 1 it totally becomes the optimistic criterion table 3 presents system benefits under the optimistic criterion the pessimistic criterion and the hurwicz criterion under different credibility levels λ 0 1 0 the results indicate that they are extreme criteria representing total optimism and pessimism therefore the hurwicz criterion is used to overcome these extreme cases and attempt to neutralized them and thus generate more flexible solutions in a more general manner by calculating each solution s weighed averaged return with such a linear combination the best return is regarded as the potentially chosen decision sheng et al 2013 rational decision makers are willing to take adaptive strategies to balance risk preferences and their progressive or conservative attitudes system benefits resulting from each credibility level and weight preferences are statistically analyzed by kruskal wallis test however results present no significant differences in different credibility levels which means that the system benefits of different credibility levels show consistency for all the credibility levels moreover to identify the effects of factors including credibility level α and β and preference weight λ on optimal outcomes factorial analysis method is adopted montgomery and runger 2010 through this method the variations of responses under different combinations can be simulated and investigated to compare variations of system benefits eight scenarios based on extreme values of credibility level α and β and preference weight λ are arranged in table 4 such a 23 design can denote the low and high levels of the factors α β and λ by the signs and respectively the effects of interest in the 23 design are the main effects α β and λ and their two factor interaction αβ αλ and βλ three factor interaction αβλ normally information on the main effects and low order interactions is more useful therefore the effect estimates can be calculated from s e contrast 2 k 1 and s s contrast 2 2 k where se is the standardized effect of each factor or multi factor interaction montgomery and runger 2010 zeng et al 2014 contrast is calculated by using plus and minus signs in each column it is determined by multiplying the combinations in the last column in table 4 by the signs in the corresponding main effect or interaction column by summing these results to obtain a contrast ss is the sum of squares of each factor k is types of factors and k 3 in this study therefore significant factors and their interactions can be identified the results indicate that preference weight λ has the largest effect accounting for 79 8 in effecting system s performance while credibility level α accounts for 18 5 the above analysis shows that preference weight is the most significant factor which should be decided carefully to integrate more implicit knowledge in decision making another point is to discuss what the effect of initial groundwater depth and soil water content on the results this is crucial to examine and reflect the role of soil water balance and groundwater balance simulation in the optimal solution for example taking three risk related parameters as α 0 7 β 0 7 and λ 0 5 seven scenarios of initial groundwater depth h 0 0 4 m 0 6 m 0 8 m 1 0 m 1 2 m and 1 4 m and 1 6 m are provided when initial soil water content is kept as θ 0 0 20 through solving the developed model optimal results are obtained it is noted that system benefits are decreased with groundwater depth increases from 1 464 109 yuan h 0 0 4 m to 1 092 109 yuan h 0 1 6 m this shows that groundwater plays a positive role in crop growth with shallower groundwater depth because the water storage in root zone can temporarily accommodate excessive applied water i e irrigation water and rainfall and thus be readily re evaporated by capillary rise for supporting crop evapotranspiration ren et al 2018b in detail a lower groundwater depth makes capillary rise of groundwater increase and thus efficiently supplement crop water consumptions without considering root zone salt accumulation under the current condition the fields are basically unaffected by soil salinity in both years because salts are leached to the deeper layer due to excessive irrigation ren et al 2018a similarly seven initial soil water contents i e 0 14 0 16 0 18 0 20 0 22 and 0 24 0 26 are presented for comparison when initial groundwater depth is set as 0 8 m the trend of optimal system benefits is raised from 1 334 109 yuan θ 0 0 14 to 1 492 109 yuan θ 0 0 26 this can be explained by irrigation planning solutions generally a lower soil water content leads to a higher water stress coefficient and thus brings more reduction of crop yield therefore variations of physical parameters can be illustrated though daily water balance equation involved in the optimization model thereby making reasonable solutions of irrigation planning to clearly understand the impact of soil water content and groundwater depth on crop growth in such a shallow groundwater region 5 conclusions a simulation optimization framework under fuzzy uncertainty is developed for irrigation planning which is the integration of fuzzy credibility based optimization model with the hurwicz criterion and daily water balance simulation afterward a case study on irrigation planning in the jiefangzha irrigation subarea in the hetao irrigation district northwest china has been provided to demonstrate its applicability therefore regarding the application of framework the following conclusions can be made 1 higher credibility levels and lower preference weights make lower benefits but lead to higher reliability levels due to more stringent constraints 2 the hurwicz criterion can provide flexible and balanced decisions to avoid extreme solutions considering preference weights 3 daily interactions among irrigation water soil water and groundwater can be illustrated by water balance simulation 4 tradeoffs between risk preference of decision makers and irrigation planning solutions can be balanced 5 preference weight plays a significant role in effecting the system performance the developed framework can be employed by government management agencies to generate decision solutions regarding field or regional irrigation planning to allocate irrigation to each crop under different scenarios furthermore this framework can be incorporated into a portable decision support system to assist in their decision analysis for example they can test their risk preferences on irrigation planning by varying preference weights to identify the most suitable solution for practical conditions among the different scenarios moreover it should integrate other methods e g remote sensing techniques aspects of soil salinity and soil evaporation into coupled optimization simulation framework to solve more complex irrigation planning problems and provide more references for decision makers declaration of competing interest the

10021,optimizing agricultural management practices is imperative for ensuring food security and building climate resilient agriculture the past several decades have witnessed the emergence of conservation tillage practices to combat soil erosion and degradation however the effects of conservation tillage on crop water productivity cwp remain uncertain especially from a regional scale perspective here we used an improved process based agroecosystem model dlem ag to quantify the long term effects of conservation tillage e g no tillage nt reduced tillage rt on cwp defined as the ratio of crop productivity to evapotranspiration of corn and soybean across the ohio river basin during 1979 2018 our results revealed an average increase of 2 8 and 8 4 in cwp for corn and soybean respectively under the nt adoption scenario compared to the conventional tillage scenario nt and rt would enhance cwp primarily due to reductions in evapotranspiration particularly evaporation further analysis suggested that although nt and rt may decrease surface runoff these practices could also increase subsurface drainage and nutrient loss from corn and soybean farmland via leaching these results indicate that conservation tillage should be complemented with additional water and nutrient management practices to enhance soil water retention and optimize nutrient use in the region s

increasing drought and extreme rainfall events have already exerted significant impacts on water resources and food security globally daryanto et al 2017a drum et al 2017 li et al 2019 adaptation of management practices is critical to improve water resource use efficiency and build climate resilient agricultural systems tian et al 2018 in that regard conservation tillage has emerged as a promising option that can help conserve soil moisture and reduce soil erosion thus alleviating the impact of rainfall deficit on crop yields busari et al 2015 holland 2004 phillips et al 1980 however its effects on regional crop water productivity cwp defined as the ratio of crop carbon gain to water consumption van halsema and vincent 2012 have not yet been fully investigated conservation tillage

tillage and ridge tillage compared to conventional tillage ct conservation tillage decreases soil disturbance and leaves more crop residues on the soil surface some studies have reported the positive effects of conservation tillage on cwp across different agroecosystems cantero martínez et al 2007 jabro et al 2014 li et al 2018 su et al 2007 tang et al 2015 however other studies have found no effect of conservation tillage on cwp or even lower cwp than ct guan et al 2015 irmak et al 2019 liu et al 2013 with the recognition that the effects of conservation tillage on cwp involve alteration of soil properties and soil water dynamics in the rhizosphere o brien and daigh 2019 these variable results likely reflect not only the direct effect of a tillage practice but also its interactions with climate soil type land management history and cropping systems strudley et al 2008 failure to account for these differences could lead to uncertainties in regional assessments of the effectiveness of conservation tillage previous studies examining linkages between conservation tillage and cwp have largely in arid semi arid regions irmak et al 2019 jabro et al 2014 yang et al 2018 less attention has been paid to how conservation tillage affects crop water use in humid areas these areas face more synergistic effects of water and nutrient supply and are more vulnerable to changes in rainfall wuebbles et al 2017 although several studies have used remote sensing products e g modis gpp and et to quantify large scale variation in cwp ai et al 2020 lu and zhuang 2010 they usually generated results for all croplands but did not provide crop specific cwp estimates moreover regional and global cwp simulations have generally ignored tillage effects in part because of the under representation of tillage processes in global ecosystem models tian et al 2015 lutz et al 2019 it is essential to adopt an integrated approach that links process based agricultural models with ground and satellite observation data to advance predictive understanding of tillage effects on regional cwp located in the eastern corn belt fig 1 the ohio river basin orb is a highly agricultural watershed with almost 98 of its croplands supporting corn and soybean production according to the 2018 national cropland data layer the agricultural landscape in the orb is susceptible to soil erosion due to heavy rains drum et al 2017 conservation tillage has been promoted as a tool to address soil erosion in this region introduced to the orb region in the 1960s and encouraged by agricultural extension agencies conservation tillage has steadily grown in adoption during the past several decades franklin and bergtold 2020 more than 60 of corn and almost 80 of soybean in the orb are grown under different forms of conservation tillage conservation tillage information center ctic 2018 the spread of conservation tillage systems in the orb justifies the need to assess its impact on water use for the dominant crops in this region long term and spatially explicit information of tillage practice effects is urgently needed to address questions of water resource optimization and predicting food production and shortages in the context of climate change therefore the orb provides an ideal context for a regional examination of these questions using our proposed integrated approach here we used a process based agroecosystem model dlem ag to quantify the magnitude and spatiotemporal patterns of cwp across the orb corn soybean cropping system for the period 1979 2018 we noticed that cwp has a long tradition among crop physiologists that continue to call water use efficiency wue e g bluemling et al 2007 perry 2007 wue is defined as wue product water applied water available representing an efficiency parameter of water utilization at the farm plot level which is scale and context dependent van halsema and vincent 2012 we defined the cwp as the ratio of gpp and et to investigate coupled carbon assimilation and water consumption from an ecosystem perspective our specific objectives were to 1 investigate the magnitude and long term trends in cwp for corn and soybean in the orb 2 quantify changes in cwp as affected by different tillage practices and 3 explore relationships between carbon and water fluxes in different tillage systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study area the orb covers 421 966 km2 within 11 states the ohio river starts at the allegheny and the monongahela s confluence in pittsburgh pennsylvania and ends in cairo illinois where it flows into the mississippi river the humid continental climate is prevalent in the upper half of the basin and a humid subtropical climate is dominant in the lower half of the basin annual rainfall for different regions within the orb ranges between 990 mm and 1 473 mm from 1979 2018 basin wide annual rainfall averaged 1 175 mm with a coefficient of variation of 0 12 nearly half of the land area in the orb is covered by forests primarily secondary growth deciduous trees cultivated cropland 30 is dominant in the northern and western sections of the orb with corn and soybean being the major crops grown santhi et al 2014 the northern portion of the orb is near the glacial margin during the late pleistocene the humid temperate climate and predominance of deciduous forests during the holocene have led to the formation of alfisols across most of the basin in the eastern and southeastern portions of the basin cropland soils are generally well drained across various slope conditions 57 well drained schilling et al 2015 in contrast croplands in the northern and northwestern portions of the basin are characterized by poorly drained conditions with slopes often 5 2 2 model description 2 2 1

exchanges of trace gases co2 ch4 and n2o between agroecosystems and the atmosphere and quantifying fluxes and storage of carbon water and nitrogen within agroecosystems as affected by multiple factors such as climate atmospheric co2 nitrogen deposition tropospheric ozone land use and land cover change and agriculture management practices e g harvest rotation irrigation and fertilizer use the model has been extensively used to study crop production soil organic carbon and greenhouse gas emissions in agroecosystems at regional and global scales the detailed structure and processes of the model have been well documented in previous work e g ren et al 2011 2012 2016 2020 tian et al 2010 2015 zhang et al 2018 2 2 2 model representation of tillage effects we have recently incorporated a tillage sub module in the dlem ag model huang et al 2020 the implementation of tillage mainly focuses on two processes that are directly affected by tillage 1 the redistribution of surface residues with tillage practice and subsequent effects on soil water dynamics and water related processes 2 the increase in decomposition rates the tillage effects are implemented in combination with residue management as these management practices are often interrelated strudley et al 2008 tillage incorporates surface residues into the soil altering the coverage of residues on top of the soil crop residues left on soil surface intercept rainfall facilitating water infiltration surface residues also serve as a barrier that lowers soil evaporation and reduces water losses to the atmosphere therefore crop residues help maintain or improve soil moisture soil moisture affects primary production by regulating the amount of available water for plants and in turn plant water uptake also changes soil moisture the tillage sub module does not consider the direct effect of tillage on soil thermal properties due to the scarcity of studies on soil thermal properties under different tillage regimes blanco canqui and ruis 2018 o brien and daigh 2019 however as soil thermal properties are intimately associated with soil hydraulic properties in the dlem ag the tillage sub module indirectly affects soil temperature by changing soil water content 2 3 input data 2 3 1 climate co2 and nitrogen deposition the daily climate data used to drive the model were derived from the gridmet dataset at a resolution of 4 km 4 km covering the united states from 1979 to 2018 abatzoglou 2013 including maximum minimum and average temperature precipitation shortwave radiation wind and relative humidity the historical atmospheric co2 concentration dataset was obtained from the earth system research laboratory of noaa national oceanic and atmospheric administration https www esrl noaa gov gmd gridded nitrogen deposition maps were extracted from the north american climate integration and diagnostics nitrogen deposition version 1 nacid ndep1 dataset hember 2018 2 3 2 crop rotation and crop phenology the crop rotation maps were generated by using the usda nass cropland data layer cdl datasets following a similar approach by panagopoulos et al 2015 and srinivasan et al 2010 we overlaid multi year cdl information to produce crop rotation maps this process resulted in dominant corn soybean or soybean corn rotations for the cropland portion of the region the 2018 cdl data showed that approximately 98 of croplands in the orb were planted with corn and soybean based on a three year rotation pattern in the orb from 2015 to 2017 we derived eight cropland rotation types involving corn and soybean 1 corn soybean 2 corn soybean soybean 3 corn corn soybean 4 soybean corn 5 soybean corn corn 6 soybean soybean corn 7 continuous corn and 8 continuous soybean these eight rotation types constitute approximately 90 of all the three year rotations that involve corn or soybean in the orb table s1 therefore minor rotation types such as corn soybean wheat and corn corn wheat were not included we then aggregated the 30 m rotation information to produce fractional rotation types at a spatial resolution of 4 km fig 1 the planting and harvesting dates for corn and soybean were derived using the 500 m crop phenology dataset from yang et al 2020 combined with the cdl datasets specifically we 1 calculated corn and soybean fractions in each 500 m grid cell 2 overlaid the center of each 4 km pixel on the 500 m phenology map to assign the index of the 500 m pixel to the nearest 4 km pixel 3 searched within 10 km around the center on the 4 km map to find the pixels with more than 55 of corn or soybean assuming that corn or soybean phenology information dominates pixels with more than 55 coverage 4 assigned the planting harvesting date of corn and soybean at the nearest pixel to the center of the 4 km pixel for unassigned pixels we replaced the value with the most adjacent pixels overall the planting date in the orb was 97 177 day of the year for both corn and soybean the harvesting dates were 289 330 and 277 290 for corn and soybean respectively 2 3 3 tillage and other agricultural management practices we obtained county level orb tillage information from the national crop residue management survey crm compiled by the conservation technology information center https www ctic org the tabular data provides the acreages and percentages of five tillage types adopted in all crops including corn and soybean for simplification we grouped the five major tillage types into three categories i e no tillage reduced tillage including ridge tillage mulch tillage and reduced tillage and conventional tillage we used county acreages combined with the cdl maps to estimate the spatial distribution of conventional and conservation tillage for corn and soybean assuming each pixel within a county has the same rates of the tillage specific area we reconstructed annual tillage maps from 1979 to 2018 based on the crm dataset 1989 2011 and assumed that the tillage maps of other years are similar to the nearest year moreover we also generated three tillage maps with all the corn soybean under a specific tillage regime such as nt rt or ct for sensitivity analysis crop specific nitrogen fertilizer use data were derived from the usda economic research service statistics on fertilizer use https www ers usda gov data products fertilizer use and price aspx covering 1960 2018 a 4 km irrigation map was reconstructed based on the modis irrigated agriculture dataset 2012 for the united states mirad us pervez and brown 2010 2 4 model evaluation the dlem ag model has been extensively calibrated and validated against both site level and regional scale data ren et al 2011 2012 2016 2020 tian et al 2010 zhang et al 2018 because we used driving forces different from previous regional studies and mainly focused on corn and soybean systems we specifically calibrated and validated the simulated crop gpp and et against published results from cropland sites in the ameriflux network https ameriflux lbl gov within and close to the orb region one site is an agricultural field on a corn soybean rotation at the fermi national accelerator laboratory batavia illinois us ib1 41 86 n 88 22 w the field has been farmed for more than 100 years and the corn soybean rotation with conventional tillage was established in july 2005 soil texture at this site is silt clay loam in the topsoil and clay from in the subsoil the other site was established in 1996 at bondville illinois us bo1 40 01 n 88 29 w the field is under continuous no tillage with alternating years of corn and soybean crops both sites have a typical humid continental climate with hot humid summers and cool to cold winters and they are representative of the northern central lowland the model was calibrated using the first two year data at each location and validated against the available data for the remaining years our evaluation results showed a general agreement between the simulated gpp and et with measurements made at the flux towers fig 2a b to evaluate the model performance at the regional level we further compared simulated npp with survey and remote sensing products fig 2c and d the temporal pattern of crop npp at the basin level was evaluated against the historical crop npp derived from crop yield records reported by the usda and derived from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis npp product mod17a3 specifically the usda crop yield records were converted to npp following the method from prince et al 2001 and li et al 2014 npp y ield f mass f dry f carbon 1 rs hi where yield is the crop yield in report unit by usda inventory bushel pound etc f mass is a factor to convert the raw yield data into a standard unit of biomass f dry is a factor to

found in li et al 2014 and ordóñez et al 2020 we overlaid the modis npp maps with the cdl data to extract corn and soybean npp from 2008 to 2017 the results showed that the simulated npp was generally within the range of survey based npp but relatively higher for corn and lower for soybean than those estimated by modis this discrepancy could be attributed partially to the light use efficiency parameterization in the modis algorithm which uses one light use efficiency value to represent all crops turner et al 2006 bandaru et al 2013 our results are in agreement with previous studies that modis npp products tend to overestimate at low productivity sites and underestimate at high productivity sites turner et al 2005 2006 2 5 model experimental design we designed four simulation scenarios to assess the magnitude and spatiotemporal patterns of corn and soybean cwp calculated as cwp gpp et during 1979 2018 and analyzed the difference associated with various tillage systems table 1 the model simulation began with an equilibrium run using 30 years 1979 2008 mean climate to develop the simulation boundary in which the year to year variations of carbon nitrogen and water pools in each grid were less than 0 1 g c m2 yr 0 1 mm h2o yr and 0 1 g n m2 yr respectively before the transient run the model was run for another 100 years for the spin up to remove system fluctuations caused by the shift from equilibrium to transient state using climate data randomly selected from 1979 to 2008 the baseline simulation scenario s1 was designed to produce cwp close to reality and its changes across the orb it was driven by historically varying tillage types and other input variables e g climate co2 nitrogen deposition fertilizer use irrigation and crop rotation for simulation scenarios s2 s4 we assumed that a specific tillage practice was applied for all the croplands across the basin over the study period comparing the four scenarios provides the potential cwp change of adopting conservation tillage in the corn and soybean systems 3 results 3 1 historical changes in air temperature and precipitation in the orb the orb has been getting warmer and wetter during 1979 2018 with substantial interannual variabilities in temperature and precipitation the largest temperature increases occurred in the periphery of the orb region including western kentucky southern and eastern indiana and western ohio fig 3a at the basin level air temperature has increased at a rate of 0 02 c year since 1979 r2 0 16 p 0 05 fig 3b relatively more precipitation increases occurred in the center of the orb along both sides of the middle ohio river especially in southeastern indiana and northern eastern kentucky fig 3c the average precipitation increased at a rate of 3 9 mm year since 1979 r2 0 10 p 0 05 fig 3d the orb region is characterized by a wet spring and dry autumn with increased precipitation intensity and frequency in spring two severe droughts large increase in temperature and decrease in precipitation occurred in 1987 and 2012 two abnormally wet periods large increase in precipitation with small temperature change were recorded in 1996 and 2018 3 2 tillage effects on gpp and et over the orb region in the orb region the mean annual gpp is 1264 174 g c m2 yr and 578 150 g c m2 yr for corn and soybean respectively fig 4a b the spatial distribution patterns of gpp for corn and soybean are similar to each other with higher gpp in the northwest orb region where agriculture is the dominant land use compared to the baseline simulation s1 tillage scenarios s2 s3 and s4 showed that the effect of tillage on gpp was negligible for both crops fig 4c h nevertheless nt and rt tended to have a slightly positive effect on gpp relative to ct the spatial distribution patterns of annual et for both crops showed an increasing trend from the northeast toward the southwest region of the orb fig 5a b the average annual et was 654 43 mm yr for corn and 454 34 mm yr for soybean the sensitivity scenarios showed that ct increased et by 1 6 0 8 in corn and 10 1 3 3 in soybean fig 5c d table 2 while nt decreased et by 2 6 1 5 in corn and 7 4 4 0 in soybean fig 5g h compared to the baseline scenario s1 generally the et reduction under nt scenario was more pronounced in the northwest of the orb where the annual et was relatively low the effect of rt on et relative to s1 was somewhat neutral 0 2 0 9 and 1 4 2 9 for corn and soybean respectively fig 5e f 3 3 tillage effects on cwp over the orb region the baseline simulation s1 showed that the mean annual cwp was 1 93 0 25 kg c m3 and 1 28 0 36 kg c m3 for corn and soybean respectively across the orb region during 1979 2018 fig 6a b the spatial patterns for the annual cwp were similar for corn and soybean areas with higher cwp occurred in the northwest section of orb and decreased southeastward the sensitivity scenarios s2 s3 and s4 revealed that the tillage induced cwp change varied among different tillage scenarios compared to the baseline scenario s1 ct decreased the mean annual cwp by 1 7 0 8 for corn and 9 2 2 7 for soybean fig 6c d table 2 while nt increased cwp by 2 8 1 6 and 8 4 4 6 for corn and soybean respectively fig 6g h the increase in cwp was more pronounced in the northern half of the orb where the annual et was relatively lower however the impact of rt on cwp was relatively neutral 0 1 0 9 and 1 1 2 7 for corn and soybean respectively fig 6e f the baseline temporal dynamics of the annual cwp showed a significant increasing trend for soybean 0 006 kg c m3 yr p 0 01 fig 7b and corn 0 004 kg c m3 yr p 0 01 fig 7a generally throughout the simulation period the nt scenario resulted in the highest annual cwp for both crops in the orb region 1 98 0 07 kg c m3 and 1 37 0 09 kg c m3 for corn and soybean respectively in comparison the ct scenario led to the lowest annual cwp 1 89 0 08 kg c m3 and 1 13 0 08 kg c m3 for corn and soybean respectively fig 7a b despite the variations in the annual cwp no significant difference in the annual cwp was observed between the rt and the baseline scenario 4 discussion 4 1 impacts of tillage management on crop gpp et and cwp our results showed that on average across the orb region different tillage regimes had indistinguishable effects on gpp for corn or soybean crops fig 4 this is not surprising considering that the orb is often water rich fig 3d adler et al 2003 with plentiful rainfall as well as numerous major rivers and impoundments alterations in soil water dynamics caused by different tillage methods would probably not limit water available for crops in the basin soil and water conservation technologies do not necessarily lead to enhanced crop productivity hellin and schrader 2003 previous studies have suggested that in comparison to humid regions dry areas where crop productivity is often limited by soil moisture could benefit more from nt adoption huang et al 2018 pittelkow et al 2015 a site level study in eastern and northern ohio found compared to ct a slightly higher crop yield under conservation tillage at a well drained site but no significant difference at a poorly drained site despite increased soil water retention under nt and rt kumar et al 2012 climate and soil may be major factors influencing crop productivity response to tillage toliver et al 2012 in southern illinois kapusta et al 1996 also observed no difference in corn yield among ct nt and rt on a silt loam soil after 20 years under each tillage treatment moreover similar gpp for wheat between ct and nt systems was recently reported in the inland pacific northwest region with a mediterranean climate chi et al 2016 and in the southern great plains with a humid subtropical climate kandel et al 2020 using the eddy covariance method with respect to et our results are consistent with the current understanding that conservation tillage decreases et compared to ct fig 5 nt and rt decreased et by 2 4 and 9 18 relative to ct in corn and soybean systems respectively these greater reductions in evaporative water loss under nt would translate into more significant improvements in cwp the ratio of gpp to et the enhancement in cwp found under the nt and rt scenarios fig 6 was mainly due to decreased et and minor changes in gpp it should be noted that a noticeable increase in cwp occurred in areas with relatively lower annual et and where there was a greater reduction in et under nt and rt compared to the areas with relatively higher et fig 5 table 2 in addition our results showed that nt and rt reduced evaporation compared to ct fig s1 they did not alter transpiration fig s2 corresponding to the negligible distinctions in gpp among different tillage scenarios surface residues create a physical barrier that reduces evaporation and increases infiltration irmak et al 2019 as a form of conservation tillage nt resulted in more crop residue coverage on the soil surface than ct and less evaporation besides tillage typically increases surface roughness reduces albedo cierniewski et al 2015 and increases net absorption of solar radiation by the soil schwartz et al 2010 hence fueling evaporation however the effects of different tillage types on surface albedo and evaporation are highly variable depending on soil color residues color and residue incorporation there is a lack of representation of the direct effects of tillage on soil thermal properties e g albedo in current modeling studies therefore our results might underestimate or overestimate the decrease in evaporation due to conservation tillage soil water evaporation is generally not favorable for crop productivity although evaporation does slightly cool the surface microenvironment klocke et al 2009 altering the soil energy balance o brien and daigh 2019 thus adopting conservation tillage can reduce water loss via evaporation and make the soil more productive by maintaining soil moisture one concern regarding residue cover in conservation tillage systems is that it tends to retard seed germination in the early spring due to the slow rate of soil warming blanco canqui and lal 2009 and could subsequently lead to reductions in crop productivity for example long term tillage studies in illinois kapusta et al 1996 and indiana griffith et al 1988 reported lower corn plant populations under nt and rt systems than ct however these studies also suggested that plant population differences among tillage systems did not translate into a yield deduction when nitrogen fertilizer was applied our results revealed that gpp was also not affected by the tillage regime at large spatial and temporal scales the present study also showed that the difference in cwp between nt and ct scenarios was higher in soybean systems 18 than in corn systems 5 fig 6 in minnesota tang et al 2015 observed similar results using eddy covariance measurement and modis products the greater response of soybean cwp could be due to its less water efficient photosynthesis pathway than corn c3 vs c4 dietzel et al 2016 it is worth noting that the soybean crop has a much lower amount of residue than corn tillage after corn might lead to more residues and exacerbate evaporation more than that after soybean the increase in cwp in nt rt soybean was observed in rotations that soybean was sown after both corn and soybean considering that most of the rotations were soybean after corn or and corn after soybean table s1 enhanced soil water content due to nt and rt would increase soybean cwp more than corn cwp 4 2 role of tillage management in the carbon and water cycles under climate change increasing cwp under climate change will largely rely on management practices to reduce soil water evaporation and shift water use to more transpiration hatfield and dold 2019 soil preparation plays a critical role in ensuring crop productivity and cwp in response to climate change our results support the theory that conservation tillage can make agroecosystem less susceptible to adverse impacts of climate change by partitioning more water into infiltration to maintain soil moisture thus potentially reducing crop water stress during drought conditions besides soils in the orb are vulnerable to water erosion particularly during heavy spring rainstorms on croplands under ct systems van pelt et al 2017 compared to ct nt and rt decreased surface runoff but increased subsurface drainage in the study region fig 8 however the sum of runoff and drainage did not vary among different tillage scenarios this finding is consistent with daryanto et al 2017b the shift in water fluxes i e et runoff and drainage among tillage systems further suggested the advantages of nt and rt in enhancing soil water storage furthermore it is generally perceived that nt and rt can reduce soil carbon loss compared to ct which helps maintain or build up soil carbon storage and improve soil structure in the long run blanco canqui and ruis 2018 however it should be noted that nt and rt also increase subsurface drainage and potentially lead to more nutrient leaching daryanto et al 2017b reported a greater loss of nitrate via leaching under nt than under ct despite similar nitrate concentration under both systems similar results were also observed for dissolvable phosphorus daryanto et al 2017c considering the abundant rainfall amount in the orb region and the increasing trend in rainfall noted in the last several decades there is a high probability that nutrient leaching from croplands would be a growing concern in the region therefore nt systems should be complemented with other measures to mitigate potential leaching loss for example cover cropping and installation of water harvesting technologies e g drainage ditches with runoff filters riparian buffers can help increase available water for crops and lower the risk of nutrient leaching daryanto et al 2018 liu and song 2020 in addition a recent study noted a declining trend in nt adoption across the us including the orb corn and soybean croplands since 2008 but increased adoption of rt from 2006 to 2016 and ct from 2007 to 2016 yu et al 2020 these trends can be ascribed to the release 2007 and 2016 of land previously enrolled in the conservation reserve program usda farm service agency 2019 reports of increased resistance of weeds to herbicides may also play a disincentivizing role in regard to nt adoption perry et al 2016 moreover farmers tend to make decisions based on many factors such as crop rotations policies and weather conditions blanco canqui and wortmann 2020 argued that occasionally tillage of cropland under nt could be a potential solution to inadequate weed control and other risks associated with continuous nt however more research is needed to identify options for optimizing the environmental and cost saving benefits of nt it is essential to point out that our simulations may represent the best case nt vs worst case ct scenarios and therefore the results should be interpreted with caution there is an urgent need for more spatio temporally explicit data to document agroecosystem level water partitioning and further our ability to predict how tillage regimes can help mitigate climate change impacts on crop productivity 5 conclusions process based agroecosystem modeling have become an integrated part and powerful tools for quantifying large scale carbon water interactions and exploring associated underlying mechanisms under various tillage management scenarios this study offers the first attempt to quantify tillage effects on regional scale cwp for the two most important crops in the orb model simulation results showed that if all the croplands in the orb region were under nt the corn and soybean cwp would increase by 1 4 and 4 13 respectively in contrast adoption of ct practice would result in cwp decreases of 2 and 9 respectively our results indicate that conservation tillage can be a viable approach to enhance cwp in corn and soybean cropping systems across the orb this benefit is mainly due to lower water loss through non beneficial evaporation under conservation tillage systems however additional management practices and strategies are needed to decrease nitrogen loss via leaching from croplands under nt future research should investigate the synergic effects of

10021,optimizing agricultural management practices is imperative for ensuring food security and building climate resilient agriculture the past several decades have witnessed the emergence of conservation tillage practices to combat soil erosion and degradation however the effects of conservation tillage on crop water productivity cwp remain uncertain especially from a regional scale perspective here we used an improved process based agroecosystem model dlem ag to quantify the long term effects of conservation tillage e g no tillage nt reduced tillage rt on cwp defined as the ratio of crop productivity to evapotranspiration of corn and soybean across the ohio river basin during 1979 2018 our results revealed an average increase of 2 8 and 8 4 in cwp for corn and soybean respectively under the nt adoption scenario compared to the conventional tillage scenario nt and rt would enhance cwp primarily due to reductions in evapotranspiration particularly evaporation further analysis suggested that although nt and rt may decrease surface runoff these practices could also increase subsurface drainage and nutrient loss from corn and soybean farmland via leaching these results indicate that conservation tillage should be complemented with additional water and nutrient management practices to enhance soil water retention and optimize nutrient use in the region s

increasing drought and extreme rainfall events have already exerted significant impacts on water resources and food security globally daryanto et al 2017a drum et al 2017 li et al 2019 adaptation of management practices is critical to improve water resource use efficiency and build climate resilient agricultural systems tian et al 2018 in that regard conservation tillage has emerged as a promising option that can help conserve soil moisture and reduce soil erosion thus alleviating the impact of rainfall deficit on crop yields busari et al 2015 holland 2004 phillips et al 1980 however its effects on regional crop water productivity cwp defined as the ratio of crop carbon gain to water consumption van halsema and vincent 2012 have not yet been fully investigated conservation tillage refers to any tillage system with a seedbed preparation technique in which at least 30 of the soil surface is covered by crop residues lal et al 2017 including no tillage nt reduced tillage rt mulch tillage and ridge tillage compared to conventional tillage ct conservation tillage decreases soil disturbance and leaves more crop residues on the soil surface some studies have reported the positive effects of conservation tillage on cwp across different agroecosystems cantero martínez et al 2007 jabro et al 2014 li et al 2018 su et al 2007 tang et al 2015 however other studies have found no effect of conservation tillage on cwp or even lower cwp than ct guan et al 2015 irmak et al 2019 liu et al 2013 with the recognition that the effects of conservation tillage on cwp involve alteration of soil properties and soil water dynamics in the rhizosphere o brien and daigh 2019 these variable results likely reflect not only the direct effect of a tillage practice but also its interactions with climate soil type land management history and cropping systems strudley et al 2008 failure to account for these differences could lead to uncertainties in regional assessments of the effectiveness of conservation tillage previous studies examining linkages between conservation tillage and cwp have largely in arid semi arid regions irmak et al 2019 jabro et al 2014 yang et al 2018 less attention has been paid to how conservation tillage affects crop water use in humid areas these areas face more synergistic effects of water and nutrient supply and are more vulnerable to changes in rainfall wuebbles et al 2017 although several studies have used remote sensing products e g modis gpp and et to quantify large scale variation in cwp ai et al 2020 lu and zhuang 2010 they usually generated results for all croplands but did not provide crop specific cwp estimates moreover regional and global cwp simulations have generally ignored tillage effects in part because of the under representation of tillage processes in global ecosystem models tian et al 2015 lutz et al 2019 it is essential to adopt an integrated approach that links process based agricultural models with ground and satellite observation data to advance predictive understanding of tillage effects on regional cwp located in the eastern corn belt fig 1 the ohio river basin orb is a highly agricultural watershed with almost 98 of its croplands supporting corn and soybean production according to the 2018 national cropland data layer the agricultural landscape in the orb is susceptible to soil erosion due to heavy rains drum et al 2017 conservation tillage has been promoted as a tool to address soil erosion in this region introduced to the orb region in the 1960s and encouraged by agricultural extension agencies conservation tillage has steadily grown in adoption during the past several decades franklin and bergtold 2020 more than 60 of corn and almost 80 of soybean in the orb are grown under different forms of conservation tillage conservation tillage information center ctic 2018 the spread of conservation tillage systems in the orb justifies the need to assess its impact on water use for the dominant crops in this region long term and spatially explicit information of tillage practice effects is urgently needed to address questions of water resource optimization and predicting food production and shortages in the context of climate change therefore the orb provides an ideal context for a regional examination of these questions using our proposed integrated approach here we used a process based agroecosystem model dlem ag to quantify the magnitude and spatiotemporal patterns of cwp across the orb corn soybean cropping system for the period 1979 2018 we noticed that cwp has a long tradition among crop physiologists that continue to call water use efficiency wue e g bluemling et al 2007 perry 2007 wue is defined as wue product water applied water available representing an efficiency parameter of water utilization at the farm plot level which is scale and context dependent van halsema and vincent 2012 we defined the cwp as the ratio of gpp and et to investigate coupled carbon assimilation and water consumption from an ecosystem perspective our specific objectives were to 1 investigate the magnitude and long term trends in cwp for corn and soybean in the orb 2 quantify changes in cwp as affected by different tillage practices and 3 explore relationships between carbon and water fluxes in different tillage systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study area the orb covers 421 966 km2 within 11 states the ohio river starts at the allegheny and the monongahela s confluence in pittsburgh pennsylvania and ends in cairo illinois where it flows into the mississippi river the humid continental climate is prevalent in the upper half of the basin and a humid subtropical climate is dominant in the lower half of the basin annual rainfall for different regions within the orb ranges between 990 mm and 1 473 mm from 1979 2018 basin wide annual rainfall averaged 1 175 mm with a coefficient of variation of 0 12 nearly half of the land area in the orb is covered by forests primarily secondary growth deciduous trees cultivated cropland 30 is dominant in the northern and western sections of the orb with corn and soybean being the major crops grown santhi et al 2014 the northern portion of the orb is near the glacial margin during the late pleistocene the humid temperate climate and predominance of deciduous forests during the holocene have led to the formation of alfisols across most of the basin in the eastern and southeastern portions of the basin cropland soils are generally well drained across various slope conditions 57 well drained schilling et al 2015 in contrast croplands in the northern and northwestern portions of the basin are characterized by poorly drained conditions with slopes often 5 2 2 model description 2 2 1 the dlem ag the agricultural module of the dynamic land ecosystem model dlem ag is a highly integrated process based agroecosystem model the dlem ag is capable of simulating the daily crop growth and exchanges of trace gases co2 ch4 and n2o between agroecosystems and the atmosphere and quantifying fluxes and storage of carbon water and nitrogen within agroecosystems as affected by multiple factors such as climate atmospheric co2 nitrogen deposition tropospheric ozone land use and land cover change and agriculture management practices e g harvest rotation irrigation and fertilizer use the model has been extensively used to study crop production soil organic carbon and greenhouse gas emissions in agroecosystems at regional and global scales the detailed structure and processes of the model have been well documented in previous work e g ren et al 2011 2012 2016 2020 tian et al 2010 2015 zhang et al 2018 2 2 2 model representation of tillage effects we have recently incorporated a tillage sub module in the dlem ag model huang et al 2020 the implementation of tillage mainly focuses on two processes that are directly affected by tillage 1 the redistribution of surface residues with tillage practice and subsequent effects on soil water dynamics and water related processes 2 the increase in decomposition rates the tillage effects are implemented in combination with residue management as these management practices are often interrelated strudley et al 2008 tillage incorporates surface residues into the soil altering the coverage of residues on top of the soil crop residues left on soil surface intercept rainfall facilitating water infiltration surface residues also serve as a barrier that lowers soil evaporation and reduces water losses to the atmosphere therefore crop residues help maintain or improve soil moisture soil moisture affects primary production by regulating the amount of available water for plants and in turn plant water uptake also changes soil moisture the tillage sub module does not consider the direct effect of tillage on soil thermal properties due to the scarcity of studies on soil thermal properties under different tillage regimes blanco canqui and ruis 2018 o brien and daigh 2019 however as soil thermal properties are intimately associated with soil hydraulic properties in the dlem ag the tillage sub module indirectly affects soil temperature by changing soil water content 2 3 input data 2 3 1 climate co2 and nitrogen deposition the daily climate data used to drive the model were derived from the gridmet dataset at a resolution of 4 km 4 km covering the united states from 1979 to 2018 abatzoglou 2013 including maximum minimum and average temperature precipitation shortwave radiation wind and relative humidity the historical atmospheric co2 concentration dataset was obtained from the earth system research laboratory of noaa national oceanic and atmospheric administration https www esrl noaa gov gmd gridded nitrogen deposition maps were extracted from the north american climate integration and diagnostics nitrogen deposition version 1 nacid ndep1 dataset hember 2018 2 3 2 crop rotation and crop phenology the crop rotation maps were generated by using the usda nass cropland data layer cdl datasets following a similar approach by panagopoulos et al 2015 and srinivasan et al 2010 we overlaid multi year cdl information to produce crop rotation maps this process resulted in dominant corn soybean or soybean corn rotations for the cropland portion of the region the 2018 cdl data showed that approximately 98 of croplands in the orb were planted with corn and soybean based on a three year rotation pattern in the orb from 2015 to 2017 we derived eight cropland rotation types involving corn and soybean 1 corn soybean 2 corn soybean soybean 3 corn corn soybean 4 soybean corn 5 soybean corn corn 6 soybean soybean corn 7 continuous corn and 8 continuous soybean these eight rotation types constitute approximately 90 of all the three year rotations that involve corn or soybean in the orb table s1 therefore minor rotation types such as corn soybean wheat and corn corn wheat were not included we then aggregated the 30 m rotation information to produce fractional rotation types at a spatial resolution of 4 km fig 1 the planting and harvesting dates for corn and soybean were derived using the 500 m crop phenology dataset from yang et al 2020 combined with the cdl datasets specifically we 1 calculated corn and soybean fractions in each 500 m grid cell 2 overlaid the center of each 4 km pixel on the 500 m phenology map to assign the index of the 500 m pixel to the nearest 4 km pixel 3 searched within 10 km around the center on the 4 km map to find the pixels with more than 55 of corn or soybean assuming that corn or soybean phenology information dominates pixels with more than 55 coverage 4 assigned the planting harvesting date of corn and soybean at the nearest pixel to the center of the 4 km pixel for unassigned pixels we replaced the value with the most adjacent pixels overall the planting date in the orb was 97 177 day of the year for both corn and soybean the harvesting dates were 289 330 and 277 290 for corn and soybean respectively 2 3 3 tillage and other agricultural management practices we obtained county level orb tillage information from the national crop residue management survey crm compiled by the conservation technology information center https www ctic org the tabular data provides the acreages and percentages of five tillage types adopted in all crops including corn and soybean for simplification we grouped the five major tillage types into three categories i e no tillage reduced tillage including ridge tillage mulch tillage and reduced tillage and conventional tillage we used county acreages combined with the cdl maps to estimate the spatial distribution of conventional and conservation tillage for corn and soybean assuming each pixel within a county has the same rates of the tillage specific area we reconstructed annual tillage maps from 1979 to 2018 based on the crm dataset 1989 2011 and assumed that the tillage maps of other years are similar to the nearest year moreover we also generated three tillage maps with all the corn soybean under a specific tillage regime such as nt rt or ct for sensitivity analysis crop specific nitrogen fertilizer use data were derived from the usda economic research service statistics on fertilizer use https www ers usda gov data products fertilizer use and price aspx covering 1960 2018 a 4 km irrigation map was reconstructed based on the modis irrigated agriculture dataset 2012 for the united states mirad us pervez and brown 2010 2 4 model evaluation the dlem ag model has been extensively calibrated and validated against both site level and regional scale data ren et al 2011 2012 2016 2020 tian et al 2010 zhang et al 2018 because we used driving forces different from previous regional studies and mainly focused on corn and soybean systems we specifically calibrated and validated the simulated crop gpp and et against published results from cropland sites in the

corn and soybean crops both sites have a typical humid continental climate with hot humid summers and cool to cold winters and they are representative of the northern central lowland the model was calibrated using the first two year data at each location and validated against the available data for the remaining years our evaluation results showed a general agreement between the simulated gpp and et with measurements made at the flux towers fig 2a b to evaluate the model performance at the regional level we further compared simulated npp with survey and remote sensing products fig 2c and d the temporal pattern of crop npp at the basin level was evaluated against the historical crop npp derived from crop yield records reported by the usda and derived from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis npp product mod17a3 specifically the usda crop yield records were converted to npp following the method from prince et al 2001 and li et al 2014 npp y ield f mass f dry f

found in li et al 2014 and ordóñez et al 2020 we overlaid the modis npp maps with the cdl data to extract corn and soybean npp from 2008 to 2017 the results showed that the simulated npp was generally within the range of survey based npp but relatively higher for corn and lower for soybean than those estimated by modis this discrepancy could be attributed partially to the light use efficiency parameterization in the modis algorithm which uses one light use efficiency value to represent all crops turner et al 2006 bandaru et al 2013 our results are in agreement with previous studies that modis npp products tend to overestimate at low productivity sites and underestimate at high productivity sites turner et al 2005 2006 2 5 model experimental design we designed four simulation scenarios to assess the magnitude and spatiotemporal patterns of corn and soybean cwp calculated as cwp gpp et during 1979 2018 and analyzed the difference associated with various tillage systems table 1 the model simulation began with an equilibrium run using 30 years 1979 2008 mean climate to develop the simulation boundary in which the year to year variations of carbon nitrogen and water pools in each grid were less than 0 1 g c m2 yr 0 1 mm h2o yr and 0 1 g n m2 yr respectively before the transient run the model was run for another 100 years for the spin up to remove system fluctuations caused by the shift from equilibrium to transient state using climate data randomly selected from 1979 to 2008 the baseline simulation scenario s1 was designed to produce cwp close to reality and its changes across the orb it was driven by historically varying tillage types and other input variables e g climate co2 nitrogen deposition fertilizer use irrigation and crop rotation for simulation scenarios s2 s4 we assumed that a specific tillage practice was applied for all the croplands across the basin over the study period comparing the four scenarios provides the potential cwp change of adopting conservation tillage in the corn and soybean systems 3 results 3 1 historical changes in air temperature and precipitation in the orb the orb has been getting warmer and wetter during 1979 2018 with substantial interannual variabilities in temperature and precipitation the largest temperature increases occurred in the periphery of the orb region including western kentucky southern and eastern indiana and western ohio fig 3a at the basin level air temperature has increased at a rate of 0 02 c year since 1979 r2 0 16 p 0 05 fig 3b relatively more precipitation increases occurred in the center of the orb along both sides of the middle ohio river especially in southeastern indiana and northern eastern kentucky fig 3c the average precipitation increased at a rate of 3 9 mm year since 1979 r2 0 10 p 0 05 fig 3d the orb region is characterized by a wet spring and dry autumn with increased precipitation intensity and frequency in spring two severe droughts large increase in temperature and decrease in precipitation occurred in 1987 and 2012 two abnormally wet periods large increase in precipitation with small temperature change were recorded in 1996 and 2018 3 2 tillage effects on gpp and et over the orb region in the orb region the mean annual gpp is 1264 174 g c m2 yr and 578 150 g c m2 yr for corn and soybean respectively fig 4a b the spatial distribution patterns of gpp for corn and soybean are similar to each other with higher gpp in the northwest orb region where agriculture is the dominant land use compared to the baseline simulation s1 tillage scenarios s2 s3 and s4 showed that the effect of tillage on gpp was negligible for both crops fig 4c h nevertheless nt and rt tended to have a slightly positive effect on gpp relative to ct the spatial distribution patterns of annual et for both crops showed an increasing trend from the northeast toward the southwest region of the orb fig 5a b the average annual et was 654 43 mm yr for corn and 454 34 mm yr for soybean the sensitivity scenarios showed that ct increased et by 1 6 0 8 in corn and 10 1 3 3 in soybean fig 5c d table 2 while nt decreased et by 2 6 1 5 in corn and 7 4 4 0 in soybean fig 5g h compared to the baseline scenario s1 generally the et reduction under nt scenario was more pronounced in the northwest of the orb where the annual et was relatively low the effect of rt on et relative to s1 was somewhat neutral 0 2 0 9 and 1 4 2 9 for corn and soybean respectively fig 5e f 3 3 tillage effects on cwp over the orb region the baseline simulation s1 showed that the mean annual cwp was 1 93 0 25 kg c m3 and 1 28 0 36 kg c m3 for corn and soybean respectively across the orb region during 1979 2018 fig 6a b the spatial patterns for the annual cwp were similar for corn and soybean areas with higher cwp occurred in the northwest section of orb and decreased southeastward the sensitivity scenarios s2 s3 and s4 revealed that the tillage induced cwp change varied among different tillage scenarios compared to the baseline scenario s1 ct decreased the mean annual cwp by 1 7 0 8 for corn and 9 2 2 7 for soybean fig 6c d table 2 while nt increased cwp by 2 8 1 6 and 8 4 4 6 for corn and soybean respectively fig 6g h the increase in cwp was more pronounced in the northern half of the orb where the annual et was relatively lower however the impact of rt on cwp was relatively neutral 0 1 0 9 and 1 1 2 7 for corn and soybean respectively fig 6e f the baseline temporal dynamics of the annual cwp showed a significant increasing trend for soybean 0 006 kg c m3 yr p 0 01 fig 7b and corn 0 004 kg c m3 yr p 0 01 fig 7a generally throughout the simulation period the nt scenario resulted in the highest annual cwp for both crops in the orb region 1 98 0 07 kg c m3 and 1 37 0 09 kg c m3 for corn and soybean respectively in comparison the ct scenario led to the lowest annual cwp 1 89 0 08 kg c m3 and 1 13 0 08 kg c m3 for corn and soybean respectively fig 7a b despite the variations in the annual cwp no significant difference in the annual cwp was observed between the rt and the baseline scenario 4 discussion 4 1 impacts of tillage management on crop gpp et and cwp our results showed that on average across the orb region different tillage regimes had indistinguishable effects on gpp for corn or soybean crops fig 4 this is not surprising considering that the orb is often water rich fig 3d adler et al 2003 with plentiful rainfall as well as numerous major rivers and impoundments alterations in soil water dynamics caused by different tillage methods would probably not limit water available for crops in the basin soil and water conservation technologies do not necessarily lead to enhanced crop productivity hellin and schrader 2003 previous studies have suggested that in comparison to humid regions dry areas where crop productivity is often limited by soil moisture could benefit more from nt adoption huang et al 2018 pittelkow et al 2015 a site level study in eastern and northern ohio found compared to ct a slightly higher crop yield under conservation tillage at a well drained site but no significant difference at a poorly drained site despite increased soil water retention under nt and rt kumar et al 2012 climate and soil may be major factors influencing crop productivity response to tillage toliver et al 2012 in southern illinois kapusta et al 1996 also observed no difference in corn yield among ct nt and rt on a silt loam soil after 20 years under each tillage treatment moreover similar gpp for wheat between ct and nt systems was recently reported in the inland pacific northwest region with a mediterranean climate chi et al 2016 and in the southern great plains with a humid subtropical climate kandel et al 2020 using the eddy covariance method with respect to et our results are consistent with the current understanding that conservation tillage decreases et compared to ct fig 5 nt and rt decreased et by 2 4 and 9 18 relative to ct in corn and soybean systems respectively these greater reductions in evaporative water loss under nt would translate into more significant improvements in cwp the ratio of gpp to et the enhancement in cwp found under the nt and rt scenarios fig 6 was mainly due to decreased et and minor changes in gpp it should be noted that a noticeable increase in cwp occurred in areas with relatively lower annual et and where there was a greater reduction in et under nt and rt compared to the areas with relatively higher et fig 5 table 2 in addition our results showed that nt and rt reduced evaporation compared to ct fig s1 they did not alter transpiration fig s2 corresponding to the negligible distinctions in gpp among different tillage scenarios surface residues create a physical barrier that reduces evaporation and increases infiltration irmak et al 2019 as a form of conservation tillage nt resulted in more crop residue coverage on the soil surface than ct and less evaporation besides tillage typically increases surface roughness reduces albedo cierniewski et al 2015 and increases net absorption of solar radiation by the soil schwartz et al 2010 hence fueling evaporation however the effects of different tillage types on surface albedo and evaporation are highly variable depending on soil color residues color and residue incorporation there is a lack of representation of the direct effects of tillage on soil thermal properties e g albedo in current modeling studies therefore our results might underestimate or overestimate the decrease in evaporation due to conservation tillage soil water evaporation is generally not favorable for crop productivity although evaporation does slightly cool the surface microenvironment klocke et al 2009 altering the soil energy balance o brien and daigh 2019 thus adopting conservation tillage can reduce water loss via evaporation and make the soil more productive by maintaining soil moisture one concern regarding residue cover in conservation tillage systems is that it tends to retard seed germination in the early spring due to the slow rate of soil warming blanco canqui and lal 2009 and could subsequently lead to reductions in crop productivity for example long term tillage studies in illinois kapusta et al 1996 and indiana griffith et al 1988 reported lower corn plant populations under nt and rt systems than ct however these studies also suggested that plant population differences among tillage systems did not translate into a yield deduction when nitrogen fertilizer was applied our results revealed that gpp was also not affected by the tillage regime at large spatial and temporal scales the present study also showed that the difference in cwp between nt and ct scenarios was higher in soybean systems 18 than in corn systems 5 fig 6 in minnesota tang et al 2015 observed similar results using eddy covariance measurement and modis products the greater response of soybean cwp could be due to its less water efficient photosynthesis pathway than corn c3 vs c4 dietzel et al 2016 it is worth noting that the soybean crop has a much lower amount of residue than corn tillage after corn might lead to more residues and exacerbate evaporation more than that after soybean the increase in cwp in nt rt soybean was observed in rotations that soybean was sown after both corn and soybean considering that most of the rotations were soybean after corn or and corn after soybean table s1 enhanced soil water content due to nt and rt would increase soybean cwp more than corn cwp 4 2 role of tillage management in the carbon and water cycles under climate change increasing cwp under climate change will largely rely on management practices to reduce soil water evaporation and shift water use to more transpiration hatfield and dold 2019 soil preparation plays a critical role in ensuring crop productivity and cwp in response to climate change our results support the theory that conservation tillage can make agroecosystem less susceptible to adverse impacts of climate change by partitioning more water into infiltration to maintain soil moisture thus potentially reducing crop water stress during drought conditions besides soils in the orb are vulnerable to water erosion particularly during heavy spring rainstorms on croplands under ct systems van pelt et al 2017 compared to ct nt and rt decreased surface runoff but increased subsurface drainage in the study region fig 8 however the sum of runoff and drainage did not vary among different tillage scenarios this finding is consistent with daryanto et al 2017b the shift in water fluxes i e et runoff and drainage among tillage systems further suggested the advantages of nt and rt in enhancing soil water storage furthermore it is generally perceived that nt and rt can reduce soil carbon loss compared to ct which helps maintain or build up soil carbon storage and improve soil structure in the long run blanco canqui and ruis 2018 however it should be noted that nt and rt also increase subsurface drainage and potentially lead to more nutrient leaching daryanto et al 2017b reported a greater loss of nitrate via leaching under nt than under ct despite similar nitrate concentration under both systems similar results were also observed for dissolvable phosphorus daryanto et al 2017c considering the abundant rainfall amount in the orb region and the increasing trend in rainfall noted in the last several decades there is a high probability that nutrient leaching from croplands would be a growing concern in the region therefore nt systems should be complemented with other measures to mitigate potential leaching loss for example cover cropping and installation of water harvesting technologies e g drainage ditches with runoff filters riparian buffers can help increase available water for crops and lower the risk of nutrient leaching daryanto et al 2018 liu and song 2020 in addition a recent study noted a declining trend in nt adoption across the us including the orb corn and soybean croplands since 2008 but increased adoption of rt from 2006 to 2016 and ct from 2007 to 2016 yu et al 2020 these trends can be ascribed to the release 2007 and 2016 of land previously enrolled in the conservation reserve program usda farm service agency 2019 reports of increased resistance of weeds to herbicides may also play a disincentivizing role in regard to nt adoption perry et al 2016 moreover farmers tend to make decisions based on many factors such as crop rotations policies and weather conditions blanco canqui and wortmann 2020 argued that occasionally tillage of cropland under nt could be a potential solution to inadequate weed control and other risks associated with continuous nt however more research is needed to identify options for optimizing the environmental and cost saving benefits of nt it is essential to point out that our simulations may represent the best case nt vs worst case ct scenarios and therefore the results should be interpreted with caution there is an urgent need for more spatio temporally explicit data to document agroecosystem level water partitioning and further our ability to predict how tillage regimes can help mitigate climate change impacts on crop productivity 5 conclusions process based agroecosystem modeling have become an integrated part and powerful tools for quantifying large scale carbon water interactions and exploring associated underlying mechanisms under various tillage management scenarios this study offers the first attempt to quantify tillage effects on regional scale cwp for the two most important crops in the orb model simulation results showed that if all the croplands in the orb region were under nt the corn and soybean cwp would increase by 1 4 and 4 13 respectively in contrast adoption of ct practice would result in cwp decreases of 2 and 9 respectively our results indicate that conservation tillage can be a viable approach to enhance cwp in corn and soybean cropping systems across the orb this benefit is mainly due to lower water loss through non beneficial evaporation under conservation tillage systems however additional management practices and strategies are needed to decrease nitrogen loss via leaching from croplands under nt future research should investigate the synergic effects of

10022,reducing use of irrigation water and improving crop yield are important since water shortage and food security are the two main problems in developing sustainable agriculture in this study we aim to reduce the conventional irrigation amount and to determine the mechanisms for yield formation and water use efficiency wue increasing and to identify the optimal irrigation amount for high yield maize 15 mg ha 1 under mulch drip irrigation in arid semi arid and semi humid areas experiments carried out in the arid area changji semi arid area qitai and semi humid area xinyuan in 2018 and 2019 showed that the optimal irrigation amount was 720 mm 540 mm and 180 mm respectively as compared to the irrigation amount used by farmers irrigation amount maximum irrigation amount the optimal irrigation amount recorded in our study could save 11 1 60 0 of water at the same time the wue and irrigation water use efficiency iwue increased by 5 2 60 3 and 7 9 181 6 with maize yield 15 mg ha 1

in recent years with the desertification of soil chen et al 2011 the rapid loss of lakes tao et al 2015 and the over exploitation of groundwater jiang 2015 water resources have become increasingly scarce in china the north and northwest china has severe water shortage as its total water resources account for only 19 in china jiang 2015 this region is also china s main grain production area the main food crops planted include maize zea mays l liu et al 2017a 2017b rice oryza sativa l peng et al 2006 and wheat triticum aestivum l chen et al 2015 according to the statistics of the ministry of agriculture and rural affairs of china the planting area of maize in 2018 was 4 2 107 ha accounting for 36 0 of the grain crop at present the average yield of maize in china is close to 6 0 mg ha 1 lower than that in american 11 06 mg ha 1 li et al 2016 since china s irrigation water efficiency is only 52 far lower than 70 80 in developed countries kang et al 2017 it is challenging to reduce regional irrigation water increase maize yield and water use efficiency wue due to different climates planting patterns and water saving technologies the maize yield and wue are quite different low wue is a common problem in maize production all over the world in turkey the maize yield was 11 1 11 6 mg ha 1 and wue was 1 9 2 1 kg m 3 under closed end furrow irrigation in semi arid climate dağdelen et al 2005 the maize yield 7 5 mg ha 1 and wue 1 4 kg m 3 were low under drip irrigation in mediterranean climate conditions bozkurt et al 2011 previous studies in china showed that the use of mulch drip irrigation technology could significantly increase maize yield and wue qin et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 2019 zhou et al 2017 liu et al 2017b our previous study also showed that under mulch drip irrigation and dense planting 12 104 ha 1 the spring maize yield was 15 mg ha 1 and wue 2 4 kg m 3 in semi arid area zhang et al 2017 at present china uses high yield maize cultivation integrated with mulch drip irrigation and dense planting however the large area and varied topography of northwest china lead to different climates throughout the year especially in xinjiang the summer precipitation varies markedly across xinjiang causing dramatic water supply variation du et al 2018 meanwhile xinjiang has a complex topography with the highest altitude of 8611 m in qogir west peak and the lowest altitude of 155 m in the turpan basin causing significant climate differences fang et al 2010 therefore irrigation regime and amount should be specifically recommended for each climatic condition for sustainable agriculture only a few studies have attempted to achieve high yield and high wue across arid to semi humid regions the response of maize grain yield to irrigation showed a quadratic curve under different irrigation methods in arid and semi arid areas such as subsurface drip irrigation payero et al 2008 irmak et al 2016 alternate furrow irrigation golzardi et al 2017 and drip irrigation under film zhang et al 2017 the yield increased linearly with the amount of irrigation up to some extent but excessive irrigation did not increase the yield further secondly wue also known as water productivity is the ratio between crop yield and water consumption per unit crop maize wue was negatively correlated with irrigation amount kuscu and demir 2013 kresović et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 moreover wue was affected by crop yield levels irrigation methods evapotranspiration et crop environment and climate characteristics kang et al 2000 abd el wahed and ali 2013 payero et al 2008 also reported that wue was significantly different in response to irrigation amount between dry and wet years in addition irrigation water use efficiency iwue is also set as an important index to evaluate the efficiency of agricultural water use in the region iwue of maize decreased sharply with increasing irrigation payero et al 2008 zhang et al 2017 moreover iwue was also affected by rainfall and its distribution during the season for example iwue was higher in dry year than in wet year irmak et al 2016 reasonable reduction of irrigation water is the key to stabilize maize yield and improve wue and iwue however previous studies mostly determined the optimal irrigation amount to achieve maximum wue and usually ignored the maize yield and there were few reports on the key factors to increase yield and water use efficiency it is important to study the impact of irrigation water on maize growth yield and wue maize grain yield is determined by aboveground dry matter dm and is influenced by harvest index hi donald and hamblin 1976 hay 1995 liu et al 2020 reported that the increase of maize grain yield at lower yield levels 15 mg ha 1 was mainly attributed to the increase in dm and hi while at higher yield levels 15 mg ha 1 it depends on the increase in dm both dm and hi were affected by irrigation some studies show that water stress significantly reduces dm of maize at the maturity stage pandey et al 2000 karam et al 2003 bozkurt et al 2011 however maize hi was not sensitive to changes in irrigation amount zhang et al 2004 under severe water deficit conditions hi was significantly reduced bozkurt et al 2011 presently mulch drip irrigation and dense planting is the new model of planting however extensive studies on the dm and hi based on this model are lacking we carried out irrigation experiments simultaneously in arid semi arid region and semi humid region the aims were that to identify the optimal irrigation amount to increase yield 15 mg ha 1 and wue under mulched drip irrigation to identify the mechanisms for yield formation and wue increase and to provide a basis for further optimization of irrigation 2 materials and

assumed to be negligible because the plot was ﬂat and d p was considered to be zero because the soil water movement was mainly in 0 60 cm and the soil water storage in the 60 100 cm was relatively stable under mulched drip irrigation liu et al 2017a 2017b zhang et al 2019 before sowing soil water content swc v v was measured using the oven drying method during maize growing period the swc was measured at 20 cm increments to a depth of 100 cm by time domain reflectometry tdr using a tube probe trime iph imko germany three 150 cm long tubes were deployed beside the drip tapes and two between the drip tapes in each plot the swc was measured every ten days from the first irrigation to harvest 2 5 statistical analysis analysis of variance anova was performed to test for harvest ear grains per ear thousand kernel weight tkw yield wue iwue dma and hi among irrigation treatments means were compared using fisher s least significant difference lsd tests at p 0 05 lsd 0 05 path analysis and linear stepwise regression were conducted with spss 18 0 software spss institute inc usa to determine the relationships between the increased values of laimax ladas dms dmm dma kernel number per ear kn tkw and yield as well as the relationship between the increased values of above indicators and the decreased values of wue sigmaplot 12 0 and graphpad prism 8 0 were used for mapping plots 3 results 3 1 yield components yield and wue the increase in irrigation amount had no effect on the number of harvested ears but it significantly increased the number of kernels per ear and thousand kernel weight thereby increasing the yield of maize table 3 wue and iwue decreased with the increase in irrigation amount in changji qitai and xinyuan sites when irrigation amount exceeded 720 mm i4 540 mm i3 and 180 mm i2 respectively kernel number per panicle thousand kernel weight and yield did not increase significantly but wue and iwue were decreased significantly table 3 the kn tkw yield wue and iwue were significantly affected by interaction of site and irrigation the yield wue and iwue were significantly affected by interaction of site and year year and irrigation the yield wue and iwue were significantly affected by interaction of site year and irrigation table 3 3 2 dry matter and hi the dry matter at maturity stage dmm and hi of maize increased with the increase of irrigation amount fig 3 in changji qitai and xinyuan when irrigation amount increased from drought stress i1 to optimum irrigation amount 720 mm i4 540 mm i3 and 180 mm i2 dmm increased by 43 8 44 9 18 3 20 2 and 11 6 25 3 and hi increased by 1 3 1 9 1 7 1 8 and 0 9 2 1 respectively this shows that as compared with hi dmm was more sensitive to increased irrigation amount under drought stress irrigation affects yield mainly through dmm however when the irrigation amount exceeded 720 mm changji 540 mm qitai and 180 mm xinyuan both the increase ratio of dmm 6 6 and hi 0 4 decreased with the increase of irrigation amount the dry matter at silking stage dms and accumulation of dry matter after silking dma of maize increased fig 4 when irrigation amount increased from drought stress i1 to optimum irrigation amount 720 mm i4 540 mm i3 and 180 mm i2 the increase ratio of dms 22 3 30 5 10 9 12 7 and 7 5 18 8 higher than that of dma 54 8 65 1 24 4 25 2 and 15 2 31 4 in changji qitai and xinyuan this indicated that high dmm depended on high dma the dms dmm and dma were significantly affected by interaction of site and year the dms dmm and dma were significantly affected by interaction of site and irrigation and the dma was significantly affected by interaction of site year and irrigation table 4 3 3 leaf area index and leaf area duration the leaf area index at silking laimax and leaf area duration after silking ladas of maize increased with the increase of irrigation amount figs 5 and 6 in changji qitai and xinyuan sites when irrigation amount exceeded 720 mm i4 540 mm i3 and 180 mm i2 respectively laimax and ladas did not increase significantly there was a positive correlation between the leaf area index at silking laimax leaf area duration ladas and dry matter accumulation after silking dma in changji qitai and xinyuan p 0 01 fig 7 the laimax laim and ladas were significantly affected by interaction of site and year the laim was significantly affected by interaction of site and irrigation the ladas was significantly affected by interaction of year and irrigation and by interaction of site year and irrigation table 5 3 4 response of photosynthetic area photoassimilation accumulation and yield components yield and wue to increase in irrigation when the minimum irrigation amount i1 increased by 90 mm the percentage of increase in laimax ladas dms dmm dma kn tkw and yield of maize were the largest while the percentage of decrease in wue negative value was the least table 6 with the increase of irrigation amount 90 mm the increasing proportion of each index decreases gradually and the decreasing amount of wue increases gradually table 6 under less than the optimal irrigation condition the increment of laimax ladas dms dmm dma kn and tkw was significantly positively correlated with the increase in yield for each 90 mm increase in irrigation amount the increment of dmm dma kn and tkw was significantly positively correlated with the decrease of wue negative value there was a significant positive correlation between yield increment and wue reduction fig 8 the results showed that under drought stress irrigation could improve photosynthetic area photoassimilation accumulation and yield components to increase yield thereby slowing down wue reduction under higher than optimal irrigation conditions only the increment of dms dmm dma kn and tkw was significantly positively correlated with the increase in yield the results indicated that the increase in yield depended on the photoassimilation accumulation and yield components but had no significant effect on the decrease of wue linear stepwise regression analysis showed that under less than the optimal irrigation condition the increment of dma and tkw had the greatest impact on increase in yield especially the tkw table 7 the increment of tkw had the greatest impact on wue reduction the results indicated that dma and tkw were key factors to reduce irrigation increase yield and wue above optimal irrigation conditions the increase of dmm and kn had the greatest impact on the increase in yield and decrease in wue respectively 3 5 leaf dry weight stem dry weight transfer amount transfer rate and contribution rate to grain under drought stress i1 maize had the lowest dry weight of leaves and stems during the silking maturity period in arid semi arid and semi humid areas figs 9 and 10 maize leaf dry weight decreased gradually at das 40 and leaf dry weight under drought stress i1 decreased significantly fig 9 the maximum stem dry weight was recorded at das 20 at maturity the stem dry weight continued to decrease under drought stress but it increased slightly due to conventional irrigation fig 10 the transfer amount ta and transfer rate tr of maize leaves and stems gradually decreased with the increase in irrigation amount table 8 after a certain amount of irrigation was exceeded qitai i3 i5 xinyuan i4 i5 the stem s ta and tr at the mature stage were positive there was no significant difference in ta and tr of leaves and stems between i4 and i5 in changji among i3 i4 and i5 in qitai and between i4 and i5 in xinyuan but they were all significantly higher than i1 under drought stress the ta tr and contribution rate to grain crg of leaves and stems were high while they were the lowest under over irrigation fig 11 4 discussion 4 1 optimal irrigation amount were determined by increasing yield and wue our study showed that maize yield increases with the increase of irrigation amount using combination of mulch drip irrigation and dense planting in 0 720 mm changji arid area 0 540 mm qitai semi arid area and 0 180 mm xinyuan semi humid area meanwhile wue and iwue were significantly decreased with the increase of irrigation amount table 3 the results were similar to those of previous studies payero et al 2008 irmak et al 2016 golzardi et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 excessive irrigation i5 farmers irrigation did not increase the yield but significantly reduce wue therefore the optimal irrigation amount of changji qitai and xinyuan were determined as 720 mm 540 mm and 180 mm by increasing maize yield and wue huang et al 2002 reported that the yield decrease caused by high irrigation amount 125 fully irrigated treatment may be the excessive growth during vegetative phase and the lack of aeration of the soil under the condition of near saturation therefore under this new planting mode the arid semi arid and semi humid areas reduce irrigation water by 11 1 60 0 compared with the irrigation level of local farmers i5 with 720 mm 540 mm and 180 mm as the optimal irrigation volume wue increased by 5 2 60 3 and iwue increased by 7 9 181 6 this achieves a goal that reducing irrigation water increasing yield 15 mg ha 1 and wue 1 5 kg m 3 the yield and wue are both higher than the current average yield of chinese maize 6 0 mg ha 1 li et al 2016 and wue 1 54 kg m 3 deng et al 2006 quantifying local crop responses to irrigation is important for establishing appropriate irrigation strategies improving field management measures including optimized irrigation plans and agronomic measures are important ways to increase crop yields and improve wue chen et al 2015 our previous research in semi arid region showed that under the high planting density 12 0 104 ha 1 spring maize yield and wue were 15 7 19 1 mg ha 1 and 2 2 2 8 kg m 3 zhang et al 2017 indicating that in arid areas the combination of mulch drip irrigation and dense planting could achieve high yield of spring maize 15 mg ha 1 and high wue 1 5 kg m 3 our study is useful to farmers who follow mulch drip irrigation and dense planting and also to agricultural water resources department for judicious use of water similar planting patterns could be implemented to reduce irrigation water increase maize yields and wue in other irrigation and supplementary irrigation areas around the world 4 2 thousand kernel weight tkw is a key factor for increasing yield and wue the number and weight of kernel are the main components of yield the decrease of yield caused by water stress was attributed to the decrease of number and weight of kernel at maturity pandey et al 2000 karam et al 2003 abd el wahed and ali 2013 golzardi et al 2017 in this study both the maximum kernel number per panicle and tkw of maize were obtained at 720 mm i4 540 mm i3 and 180 mm i2 under mulch drip irrigation and dense planting in arid semi arid and sub humid areas respectively table 3 this could be because in the optimally irrigated conditions there was enough water available in soil female panicle differentiation kernel number was not restricted and the absorption of water and nutrients was promoted so that the maize maintains a higher metabolic mechanism and finally obtains the maximum kernel weight abd el wahed and ali 2013 water stress at the vegetative growth stage of maize limit the potential yield kernel number payero et al 2009 while that in the reproductive phase mainly affects the increase in kernel weight karam et al 2003 in this study the correlation between increase in tkw and yield was higher than that between increase in kn and yield under drought stress p 0 05 fig 8 this is because under mulch drip irrigation system maize was irrigated for the first time at v6 v10 and v12 in arid semi arid and sub humid areas respectively and more than 60 irrigation water is provided after tasseling of maize hence irrigation impacts kernel weight more than kernel number in this study we also observed that under water stress tkw increased yield and wue table 7 therefore tkw is one of the factors for increasing maize yield and wue 4 3 dry matter accumulates after silking dma is another key factor for increasing yield and wue dry matter and hi are the basis on which maize yield is calculated increasing dma and hi are the main strategies to improve maize yield liu et al 2020 water or nutrient stress limited the relationship between radiation reception and photosynthesis of leaf then photosynthetic efficiency of canopy was reduced due to stress which would affect dma tollenaar et al 2006 our study illustrated that on increasing irrigation from drought stress i1 to optimal amount the increase of dmm 18 3 44 9 was higher than hi 1 3 2 1 in arid semi arid and semi humid areas fig 3 our result is similar to that of maize in semi arid climate payero et al 2009 and eastern mediterranean climate bozkurt et al 2011 in turkey it proves that as compared with hi dm is more sensitive to irrigation in different climate types in this study there was a positive correlation between laimax ladas and dma fig 7 the increase in laimax ladas dms dmm and dma was significantly positively correlated with the increase of yield under drought stress p 0 05 the increase in dmm and dma was positively correlated with the decrease in wue negative value p 0 05 moreover the yield increment was significantly positively correlated with the reduction of wue negative value p 0 01 fig 8 we also observed that under water stress dma increased yield and wue table 7 this result showed that under drought conditions adequate irrigation increased grain yield as a result of high dma and thus the effect on wue improvement was greater than that of water saving irrigation in other words dry matter accumulates after silking dma is another key factor for increasing maize yield and wue 4 4 improving the transport of photosynthate to grain after silking optimizes irrigation leaves and stems except ears account for a large proportion of total dm in maize johnson et al 1966 payero et al 2008 proposed that irrigation would affect the production and distribution of dm in various organs after silking leaves and stems of maize showed a small amount of nutrient increase and dry weight of leaves and stems decreased due to decrease in proteins and soluble carbohydrates johnson et al 1966 in this study drought stress could lead to premature leaf senescence and reduce the accumulation of soluble carbohydrates in leaves and stems figs 5 9 and 10 this indicates that when the assimilation produced by the leaves cannot satisfy the grain filling that in the stems will be mobilized under drought stress we also observed that the increase of laimax and ladas was significantly positively correlated p 0 01 with the increase of maize yield under drought stress the increase of laimax and ladas of maize was not significant with the increase of yield under over irrigation p 0 05 fig 8 therefore drought stress reduces yield mainly because drought stress inhibits the growth of maize reduces the photosynthetic area of individuals and population and reduces the photosynthetic rate qin et al 2019 the distribution of nutrients in leaves and stems were restricted due to the reduction of photosynthetic products per unit leaf area and the reduction of proteins and soluble carbohydrates in stems the nutrients mainly flow to ears and grains in the later stages of growth the supply of assimilates in the leaves and the re mobilization of carbohydrates in the stem are crucial for kernel filling our study showed that maize under drought stress i1 had the largest ta tr and crg of leaves and stems in the mature stage table 8 water stress in the kernel filling stage induces early crop senescence and shortens the filling time but increases the re mobilization of assimilation from the stem to the kernel plaut et al 2004 yang and zhang 2006 golzardi et al 2017 in this study in the mature stage of over irrigated maize the greenness of leaves was better but the dry weight of leaves decreased and the dry weight of culms increased slightly i3 i5 in semi arid region and i4 i5 in sub humid region figs 5 9 and 10 this was due to the rapid mobilization of carbohydrates in the stem in response to leaf dry weight rather than leaf greenness dwyer et al 1995 these results indicated that not all of the photosynthate produced by over irrigated leaves was transferred to the grains grain storage capacity limit but it was stored in the stem figs 9 and 10 the grains yield did not increase significantly leading to decline in wue under over irrigation therefore under the premise of obtaining sufficient photosynthate improving the transport of photosynthate to grain after silking is the goals of further optimizing irrigation in practice if irrigation is not restricted farmers could increase storage capacity of grain by increasing planting densities and maximizing photosynthesis and irrigation water use to achieve high maize yield 5 conclusion in this study the use of mulch drip irrigation and dense planting mode reduced conventional irrigation by 11 1 60 0 stabilized high yield of spring maize 15 mg ha 1 and increased water use efficiency wue by 5 2 60 3 and irrigation water use efficiency iwue by 7 9 181 6 in irrigated area arid and semi arid area and supplementary irrigated area sub humid area under drought stress increasing dry matter accumulates after silking dma and thousand kernel weight tkw increased yield and wue under over irrigation the yield further increased mainly by dry matter at maturity dmm and wue was improved by kernel number kn the most photosynthate was transferred from leaves and stems to grains in minimum irrigation but the lowest that in maximum irrigation optimize

10022,reducing use of irrigation water and improving crop yield are important since water shortage and food security are the two main problems in developing sustainable agriculture in this study we aim to reduce the conventional irrigation amount and to determine the mechanisms for yield formation and water use efficiency wue increasing and to identify the optimal irrigation amount for high yield maize 15 mg ha 1 under mulch drip irrigation in arid semi arid and semi humid areas experiments carried out in the arid area changji semi arid area qitai and semi humid area xinyuan in 2018 and 2019 showed that the optimal irrigation amount was 720 mm 540 mm and 180 mm respectively as compared to the irrigation amount used by farmers irrigation amount maximum irrigation amount the optimal irrigation amount recorded in our study could save 11 1 60 0 of water at the same time the wue and irrigation water use efficiency iwue increased by 5 2 60 3 and 7 9 181 6 with maize yield 15 mg ha 1 less than optimal irrigation increasing yield and wue by increasing both dry matter accumulation after silking dma and thousand kernel weight tkw over optimal irrigation the yield further increased mainly by increasing dry matter at maturity and increasing wue by kernel number per ear the most photosynthate was transferred from leaves and stems to grains in minimum irrigation but the lowest that in maximum irrigation therefore dma and tkw are the key factors to increase yield and wue under less than optimal irrigation optimize irrigation goal may be to improve the transport of photosynthate

in recent years with the desertification of soil chen et al 2011 the rapid loss of lakes tao et al 2015 and the over exploitation of groundwater jiang 2015 water resources have become increasingly scarce in china the north and northwest china has severe water shortage as its total water resources account for only 19 in china jiang 2015 this region is also china s main grain production area the main food crops planted include maize zea mays l liu et al 2017a 2017b rice oryza sativa l peng et al 2006 and wheat triticum aestivum l chen et al 2015 according to the statistics of the ministry of agriculture and rural affairs of china the planting area of maize in 2018 was 4 2 107 ha accounting for 36 0 of the grain crop at present the average yield of maize in china is close to 6 0 mg ha 1 lower than that in american 11 06 mg ha 1 li et al 2016 since china s irrigation water efficiency is only 52 far lower than 70 80 in developed countries kang et al 2017 it is challenging to reduce regional irrigation water increase maize yield and water use efficiency wue due to different climates planting patterns and water saving technologies the maize yield and wue are quite different low wue is a common problem in maize production all over the world in turkey the maize yield was 11 1 11 6 mg ha 1 and wue was 1 9 2 1 kg m 3 under closed end furrow irrigation in semi arid climate dağdelen et al 2005 the maize yield 7 5 mg ha 1 and wue 1 4 kg m 3 were low under drip irrigation in mediterranean climate conditions bozkurt et al 2011 previous studies in china showed that the use of mulch drip irrigation technology could significantly increase maize yield and wue qin et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 2019 zhou et al 2017 liu et al 2017b our previous study also showed that under mulch drip irrigation and dense planting 12 104 ha 1 the spring maize yield was 15 mg ha 1 and wue 2 4 kg m 3 in semi arid area zhang et al 2017 at present china uses high yield maize cultivation integrated with mulch drip irrigation and dense planting however the large area and varied topography of northwest china lead to different climates throughout the year especially in xinjiang the summer precipitation varies markedly across xinjiang causing dramatic water supply variation du et al 2018 meanwhile xinjiang has a complex topography with the highest altitude of 8611 m in qogir west peak and the lowest altitude of 155 m in the turpan basin causing significant climate differences fang et al 2010 therefore irrigation regime and amount should be specifically recommended for each climatic condition for sustainable agriculture only a few studies have attempted to achieve high yield and high wue across arid to semi humid regions the response of maize grain yield to irrigation showed a quadratic curve under different irrigation methods in arid and semi arid areas such as subsurface drip irrigation payero et al 2008 irmak et al 2016 alternate furrow irrigation golzardi et al 2017 and drip irrigation under film zhang et al 2017 the yield increased linearly with the amount of irrigation up to some extent but excessive irrigation did not increase the yield further secondly wue also known as water productivity is the ratio between crop yield and water consumption per unit crop maize wue was negatively correlated with irrigation amount kuscu and demir 2013 kresović et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 moreover wue was affected by crop yield levels irrigation methods evapotranspiration et crop environment and climate characteristics kang et al 2000 abd el wahed and ali 2013 payero et al 2008 also reported that wue was significantly different in response to irrigation amount between dry and wet years in addition irrigation water use efficiency iwue is also set as an important index to evaluate the efficiency of agricultural water use in the region iwue of maize decreased sharply with increasing irrigation payero et al 2008 zhang et al 2017 moreover iwue was also affected by rainfall and its distribution during the season for example iwue was higher in dry year than in wet year irmak et al 2016 reasonable reduction of irrigation water is the key to stabilize maize yield and improve wue and iwue however previous studies mostly determined the optimal irrigation amount to achieve maximum wue and usually ignored the maize yield and there were few reports on the key factors to increase yield and water use efficiency it is important to study the impact of irrigation water on maize growth yield and wue maize grain yield is determined by aboveground dry matter dm and is influenced by harvest index hi donald and hamblin 1976 hay 1995 liu et al 2020 reported that the increase of maize grain yield at lower yield levels 15 mg ha 1 was mainly attributed to the increase in dm and hi while at higher yield levels 15 mg ha 1 it depends on the increase in dm both dm and hi were affected by irrigation some studies show that water stress significantly reduces dm of maize at the maturity stage pandey et al 2000 karam et al 2003 bozkurt et al 2011 however maize hi was not sensitive to changes in irrigation amount zhang et al 2004 under severe water deficit conditions hi was significantly reduced bozkurt et al 2011 presently mulch drip irrigation and dense planting is the new model of planting however extensive studies on the dm and hi based on this model are lacking we carried out irrigation experiments simultaneously in arid semi arid region and semi humid region the aims were that to identify the optimal irrigation amount to increase yield 15 mg ha 1 and wue under mulched drip irrigation to identify the mechanisms for yield formation and wue increase and to provide a basis for further optimization of irrigation 2 materials and

assumed to be negligible because the plot was ﬂat and d p was considered to be zero because the soil water movement was mainly in 0 60 cm and the soil water storage in the 60 100 cm was relatively stable under mulched drip irrigation liu et al 2017a 2017b zhang et al 2019 before sowing soil water content swc v v was measured using the oven drying method during maize growing period the swc was measured at 20 cm increments to a depth of 100 cm by time domain reflectometry tdr using a tube probe trime iph imko germany three 150 cm long tubes were deployed beside the drip tapes and two between the drip tapes in each plot the swc was measured every ten days from the first irrigation to harvest 2 5 statistical analysis analysis of variance anova was performed to test for harvest ear grains per ear thousand kernel weight tkw yield wue iwue dma and hi among irrigation treatments means were compared using fisher s least significant difference lsd tests at p 0 05 lsd 0 05 path analysis and linear stepwise regression were conducted with spss 18 0 software spss institute inc usa to determine the relationships between the increased values of laimax ladas dms dmm dma kernel number per ear kn tkw and yield as well as the relationship between the increased values of above indicators and the decreased values of wue sigmaplot 12 0 and graphpad prism 8 0 were used for mapping plots 3 results 3 1 yield components yield and wue the increase in irrigation amount had no effect on the number of harvested ears but it significantly increased the number of kernels per ear and thousand kernel weight thereby increasing the yield of maize table 3 wue and iwue decreased with the increase in irrigation amount in changji qitai and xinyuan sites when irrigation amount exceeded 720 mm i4 540 mm i3 and 180 mm i2 respectively kernel number per panicle thousand kernel weight and yield did not increase significantly but wue and iwue were decreased significantly table 3 the kn tkw yield wue and iwue were significantly affected by interaction of site and irrigation the yield wue and iwue were significantly affected by interaction of site and year year and irrigation the yield wue and iwue were significantly affected by interaction of site year and irrigation table 3 3 2 dry matter and hi the dry matter at maturity stage dmm and hi of maize increased with the increase of irrigation amount fig 3 in changji qitai and xinyuan when irrigation amount increased from drought stress i1 to optimum irrigation amount 720 mm i4 540 mm i3 and 180 mm i2 dmm increased by 43 8 44 9 18 3 20 2 and 11 6 25 3 and hi increased by 1 3 1 9 1 7 1 8 and 0 9 2 1 respectively this shows that as compared with hi dmm was more sensitive to increased irrigation amount under drought stress irrigation affects yield mainly through dmm however when the irrigation amount exceeded 720 mm changji 540 mm qitai and 180 mm xinyuan both the increase ratio of dmm 6 6 and hi 0 4 decreased with the increase of irrigation amount the dry matter at silking stage dms and accumulation of dry matter after silking dma of maize increased fig 4 when irrigation amount increased from drought stress i1 to optimum irrigation amount 720 mm i4 540 mm i3 and 180 mm i2 the increase ratio of dms 22 3 30 5 10 9 12 7 and 7 5 18 8 higher than that of dma 54 8 65 1 24 4 25 2 and 15 2 31 4 in changji qitai and xinyuan this indicated that high dmm depended on high dma the dms dmm and dma were significantly affected by interaction of site and year the dms dmm and dma were significantly affected by interaction of site and irrigation and the dma was significantly affected by interaction of site year and irrigation table 4 3 3 leaf area index and leaf area duration the leaf area index at silking laimax and leaf area duration after silking ladas of maize increased with the increase of irrigation amount figs 5 and 6 in changji qitai and xinyuan sites when irrigation amount exceeded 720 mm i4 540 mm i3 and 180 mm i2 respectively laimax and ladas did not increase significantly there was a positive correlation between the leaf area index at silking laimax leaf area duration ladas and dry matter accumulation after silking dma in changji qitai and xinyuan p 0 01 fig 7 the laimax laim and ladas were significantly affected by interaction of site and year the laim was significantly affected by interaction of site and irrigation the ladas was significantly affected by interaction of year and irrigation and by interaction of site year and irrigation table 5 3 4 response of photosynthetic area photoassimilation accumulation and yield components yield and wue to increase in irrigation when the minimum irrigation amount i1 increased by 90 mm the percentage of increase in laimax ladas dms dmm dma kn tkw and yield of maize were the largest while the percentage of decrease in wue negative value was the least table 6 with the increase of irrigation amount 90 mm the increasing proportion of each index decreases gradually and the decreasing amount of wue increases gradually table 6 under less than the optimal irrigation condition the increment of laimax ladas dms dmm dma kn and tkw was significantly positively correlated with the increase in yield for each 90 mm increase in irrigation amount the increment of dmm dma kn and tkw was significantly positively correlated with the decrease of wue negative value there was a significant positive correlation between yield increment and wue reduction fig 8 the results showed that under drought stress irrigation could improve photosynthetic area photoassimilation accumulation and yield components to increase yield thereby slowing down wue reduction under higher than optimal irrigation conditions only the increment of dms dmm dma kn and tkw was significantly positively correlated with the increase in yield the results indicated that the increase in yield depended on the photoassimilation accumulation and yield components but had no significant effect on the decrease of wue linear stepwise regression analysis showed that under less than the optimal irrigation condition the increment of dma and tkw had the greatest impact on increase in yield especially the tkw table 7 the increment of tkw had the greatest impact on wue reduction the results indicated that dma and tkw were key factors to reduce irrigation increase yield and wue above optimal irrigation conditions the increase of dmm and kn had the greatest impact on the increase in yield and decrease in wue respectively 3 5 leaf dry weight stem dry weight transfer amount transfer rate and contribution rate to grain under drought stress i1 maize had the lowest dry weight of leaves and stems during the silking maturity period in arid semi arid and semi humid areas figs 9 and 10 maize leaf dry weight decreased gradually at das 40 and leaf dry weight under drought stress i1 decreased significantly fig 9 the maximum stem dry weight was recorded at das 20 at maturity the stem dry weight continued to decrease under drought stress but it increased slightly due to conventional irrigation fig 10 the transfer amount ta and transfer rate tr of maize leaves and stems gradually decreased with the increase in irrigation amount table 8 after a certain amount of irrigation was exceeded qitai i3 i5 xinyuan i4 i5 the stem s ta and tr at the mature stage were positive there was no significant difference in ta and tr of leaves and stems between i4 and i5 in changji among i3 i4 and i5 in qitai and between i4 and i5 in xinyuan but they were all significantly higher than i1 under drought stress the ta tr and contribution rate to grain crg of leaves and stems were high while they were the lowest under over irrigation fig 11 4 discussion 4 1 optimal irrigation amount were determined by increasing yield and wue our study showed that maize yield increases with the increase of irrigation amount using combination of mulch drip irrigation and dense planting in 0 720 mm changji arid area 0 540 mm qitai semi arid area and 0 180 mm xinyuan semi humid area meanwhile wue and iwue were significantly decreased with the increase of irrigation amount table 3 the results were similar to those of previous studies payero et al 2008 irmak et al 2016 golzardi et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 excessive irrigation i5 farmers irrigation did not increase the yield but significantly reduce wue therefore the optimal irrigation amount of changji qitai and xinyuan were determined as 720 mm 540 mm and 180 mm by increasing maize yield and wue huang et al 2002 reported that the yield decrease caused by high irrigation amount 125 fully irrigated treatment may be the excessive growth during vegetative phase and the lack of aeration of the soil under the condition of near saturation therefore under this new planting mode the arid semi arid and semi humid areas reduce irrigation water by 11 1 60 0 compared with the irrigation level of local farmers i5 with 720 mm 540 mm and 180 mm as the optimal irrigation volume wue increased by 5 2 60 3 and iwue increased by 7 9 181 6 this achieves a goal that reducing irrigation water increasing yield 15 mg ha 1 and wue 1 5 kg m 3 the yield and wue are both higher than the current average yield of chinese maize 6 0 mg ha 1 li et al 2016 and wue 1 54 kg m 3 deng et al 2006 quantifying local crop responses to irrigation is important for establishing appropriate irrigation strategies improving field management measures including optimized irrigation plans and agronomic measures are important ways to increase crop yields and improve wue chen et al 2015 our previous research in semi arid region showed that under the high planting density 12 0 104 ha 1 spring maize yield and wue were 15 7 19 1 mg ha 1 and 2 2 2 8 kg m 3 zhang et al 2017 indicating that in arid areas the combination of mulch drip irrigation and dense planting could achieve high yield of spring maize 15 mg ha 1 and high wue 1 5 kg m 3 our study is useful to farmers who follow mulch drip irrigation and dense planting and also to agricultural water resources department for judicious use of water similar planting patterns could be implemented to reduce irrigation water increase maize yields and wue in other irrigation and supplementary irrigation areas around the world 4 2 thousand kernel weight tkw is a key factor for increasing yield and wue the number and weight of kernel are the main components of yield the decrease of yield caused by water stress was attributed to the decrease of number and weight of kernel at maturity pandey et al 2000 karam et al 2003 abd el wahed and ali 2013 golzardi et al 2017 in this study both the maximum kernel number per panicle and tkw of maize were obtained at 720 mm i4 540 mm i3 and 180 mm i2 under mulch drip irrigation and dense planting in arid semi arid and sub humid areas respectively table 3 this could be because in the optimally irrigated conditions there was enough water available in soil female panicle differentiation kernel number was not restricted and the absorption of water and nutrients was promoted so that the maize maintains a higher metabolic mechanism and finally obtains the maximum kernel weight abd el wahed and ali 2013 water stress at the vegetative growth stage of maize limit the potential yield kernel number payero et al 2009 while that in the reproductive phase mainly affects the increase in kernel weight karam et al 2003 in this study the correlation between increase in tkw and yield was higher than that between increase in kn and yield under drought stress p 0 05 fig 8 this is because under mulch drip irrigation system maize was irrigated for the first time at v6 v10 and v12 in arid semi arid and sub humid areas respectively and more than 60 irrigation water is provided after tasseling of maize hence irrigation impacts kernel weight more than kernel number in this study we also observed that under water stress tkw increased yield and wue table 7 therefore tkw is one of the factors for increasing maize yield and wue 4 3 dry matter accumulates after silking dma is another key factor for increasing yield and wue dry matter and hi are the basis on which maize yield is calculated increasing dma and hi are the main strategies to improve maize yield liu et al 2020 water or nutrient stress limited the relationship between radiation reception and photosynthesis of leaf then photosynthetic efficiency of canopy was reduced due to stress which would affect dma tollenaar et al 2006 our study illustrated that on increasing irrigation from drought stress i1 to optimal amount the increase of dmm 18 3 44 9 was higher than hi 1 3 2 1 in arid semi arid and semi humid areas fig 3 our result is similar to that of maize in semi arid climate payero et al 2009 and eastern mediterranean climate bozkurt et al 2011 in turkey it proves that as compared with hi dm is more sensitive to irrigation in different climate types in this study there was a positive correlation between laimax ladas and dma fig 7 the increase in laimax ladas dms dmm and dma was significantly positively correlated with the increase of yield under drought stress p 0 05 the increase in dmm and dma was positively correlated with the decrease in wue negative value p 0 05 moreover the yield increment was significantly positively correlated with the reduction of wue negative value p 0 01 fig 8 we also observed that under water stress dma increased yield and wue table 7 this result showed that under drought conditions adequate irrigation increased grain yield as a result of high dma and thus the effect on wue improvement was greater than that of water saving irrigation in other words dry matter accumulates after silking dma is another key factor for increasing maize yield and wue 4 4 improving the transport of photosynthate to grain after silking optimizes irrigation leaves and stems except ears account for a large proportion of total dm in maize johnson et al 1966 payero et al 2008 proposed that irrigation would affect the production and distribution of dm in various organs after silking leaves and stems of maize showed a small amount of nutrient increase and dry weight of leaves and stems decreased due to decrease in proteins and soluble carbohydrates johnson et al 1966 in this study drought stress could lead to premature leaf senescence and reduce the accumulation of soluble carbohydrates in leaves and stems figs 5 9 and 10 this indicates that when the assimilation produced by the leaves cannot satisfy the grain filling that in the stems will be mobilized under drought stress we also observed that the increase of laimax and ladas was significantly positively correlated p 0 01 with the increase of maize yield under drought stress the increase of laimax and ladas of maize was not significant with the increase of yield under over irrigation p 0 05 fig 8 therefore drought stress reduces yield mainly because drought stress inhibits the growth of maize reduces the photosynthetic area of individuals and population and reduces the photosynthetic rate qin et al 2019 the distribution of nutrients in leaves and stems were restricted due to the reduction of photosynthetic products per unit leaf area and the reduction of proteins and soluble carbohydrates in stems the nutrients mainly flow to ears and grains in the later stages of growth the supply of assimilates in the leaves and the re mobilization of carbohydrates in the stem are crucial for kernel filling our study showed that maize under drought stress i1 had the largest ta tr and crg of leaves and stems in the mature stage table 8 water stress in the kernel filling stage induces early crop senescence and shortens the filling time but increases the re mobilization of assimilation from the stem to the kernel plaut et al 2004 yang and zhang 2006 golzardi et al 2017 in this study in the mature stage of over irrigated maize the greenness of leaves was better but the dry weight of leaves decreased and the dry weight of culms increased slightly i3 i5 in semi arid region and i4 i5 in sub humid region figs 5 9 and 10 this was due to the rapid mobilization of carbohydrates in the stem in response to leaf dry weight rather than leaf greenness dwyer et al 1995 these results indicated that not all of the photosynthate produced by over irrigated leaves was transferred to the grains grain storage capacity limit but it was stored in the stem figs 9 and 10 the grains yield did not increase significantly leading to decline in wue under over irrigation therefore under the premise of obtaining sufficient photosynthate improving the transport of photosynthate to grain after silking is the goals of further optimizing irrigation in practice if irrigation is not restricted farmers could increase storage capacity of grain by increasing planting densities and maximizing photosynthesis and irrigation water use to achieve high maize yield 5 conclusion in this study the use of mulch drip irrigation and dense planting mode reduced conventional irrigation by 11 1 60 0 stabilized high yield of spring maize 15 mg ha 1 and increased water use efficiency wue by 5 2 60 3 and irrigation water use efficiency iwue by 7 9 181 6 in irrigated area arid and semi arid area and supplementary irrigated area sub humid area under drought stress increasing dry matter accumulates after silking dma and thousand kernel weight tkw increased yield and wue under over irrigation the yield further increased mainly by dry matter at maturity dmm and wue was improved by kernel number kn the most photosynthate was transferred from leaves and stems to grains in minimum irrigation but the lowest that in maximum irrigation optimize irrigation goal may be to improve the transport of photosynthate to grain in the future declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

10023,we demonstrated a drainmod modeling framework to predict controlled drainage cd effect on the fate of water in artificially drained agricultural fields which is key for determining the water quality benefits of the practice to demonstrate this modeling framework drainmod simulated the hydrology of a subsurface drained grass field in eastern north carolina u s under both free drainage fd and cd three scenarios were simulated for each water management no lateral seepage ls and ls with constant and dynamic hydraulic head hr for each scenario predicted water table depth wtd and subsurface drainage were compared to observed values using mean absolute error nash sutcliffe efficiency and normalized percent error predicted water balance components for different scenarios were also investigated results clearly showed that ls was a significant component of the water balance for cd model predictions showed that 96 of the reduction in subsurface drainage due to cd could be attributed to ls 33 5 cm yr 1 the large values of ls predicted by the model were attributed to the presence of a permeable sandy layer in the soil profile the shallow management depth of the drain outlet and the small size of the experimental field plots agreement between predicted and observed wtd and subsurface drainage ranged from acceptable to excellent for fd with and without considering ls in contrast drainmod simulations for cd yielded acceptable predictions only for the scenario considering ls with dynamic hr this study demonstrated the power of process based simulation models such as drainmod for interpreting and explaining data of experimental studies and underscored the importance of using a proper model calibration strategy for yielding reliable predictions this study highlights the need for well coordinated experimental and modeling research to further investigate how seepage affect cd performance for reducing drainage flow and nitrogen losses from artificially drained agricultural fields keywords drainage water management drainmod water table management agricultural drainage hydrologic modeling 1 introduction controlled drainage cd is a water management practice for reducing nitrogen n loss from artificially drained agricultural land the reduction of drainage flow by cd has been widely accepted as the main mechanism for reducing n loss from drained fields to receiving surface water bodies skaggs et al 2010 early studies in north carolina u s showed that cd reduced both drainage flow and n loss by almost the same percentage e g gilliam et al 1979 skaggs and gilliam 1981 evans et al 1995 in ontario canada cd reduced n losses from a corn soybean rotation on a subsurface drained clay loam soil by 44 and 31 under two n fertilization rates drury et al 2009 helmers et al 2012 reported that cd reduced drain flow and n loading on average by 37 and 36 in iowa jaynes 2012 reported in another study in iowa that cd reduced subsurface drain flow by 21 and n loading by 29 poole et al 2018 attributed n load reduction 30 to a reduction in drainage flow 33 and increase in crop yield 11 for corn and 10 for soybean in a 9 year study in eastern north carolina controlled drainage tends to increase evapotranspiration et surface runoff ro vertical and or lateral seepage vls compared to free drainage fd with continuously open drain outlets skaggs et al 2010 youssef et al 2018 skaggs et al 2010 pointed out that if total water loss from a subsurface drained field ro plus subsurface drainage d was reduced by cd by more than 20 seepage vls may have been an important factor in the reduction skaggs et al 2010 also stated that the increase in et caused by cd might not be greater than 10 they noted that the effect of lateral seepage through field boundaries becomes more pronounced as the area of the field in cd mode gets smaller and the influence of the boundary conditions becomes greater understanding the effect of cd on field hydrology and different water balance components is key to understanding the effect of the practice on n fate and transport in artificially drained cropland researchers have been looking for ways to estimate water balance components in subsurface drained fields using field observations of water table depth wtd drainage flow rate and weather data to calibrate computer simulation models such as drainmod skaggs et al 2010 can help estimate different components of the water balance for experimental fields and subsequently help answer the questions related to the fate of the water as affected by cd drainmod has been used to simulate water balance components including vertical seepage in several studies in united states and canada ale et al 2009 bourke 2012 chang et al 1983 negm et al 2017 youssef et al 2018 for example ale et al 2009 compared drainmod simulated water balances for a drained field in indiana u s under cd and fd scenarios and estimated that 68 of simulated reduction in drainage flow by cd went to enhanced vertical seepage a four year experimental study carried out in eastern north carolina on an artificially drained pasture field receiving swine lagoon effluent has shown that cd substantially reduced subsurface drainage flow by over 90 when compared to fd liu et al 2019 the large percent reduction in drainage flow raised an important question where did the water normally drained via the continuously opened subsurface drains fd go when the system is operated in cd mode we conducted a drainmod modeling study to investigate the effect of cd on field water balance and estimate the fate of the water that did not leave the field via subsurface drainage because of cd implementation the approach presented in this study can be used by drainmod users as framework for simulating lateral seepage caused by cd 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the experimental site the experimental site 35 51 11 3 n 76 39 31 1 w is an artificially drained pasture field located in the lower coastal plain of the state of north carolina u s the site has an elevation of 6 4 m above mean sea level and a slope of 0 07 burchell et al 2005 liu et al 2019 the soil at the site is a poorly drained cape fear loam gilliam et al 1979 according to soil survey data nrcs 2015 and field investigations there are five distinct soil layers extending from the soil surface down to an impervious layer at an estimated depth of 300 cm loam 0 35 cm clay 35 105 cm sandy clay loam 105 135 cm sand 135 210 cm sandy clay 210 300 cm the geographic location and the layout of the experimental field are shown in fig 1 the drainage system at the site consists of eight lateral subsurface drain lines installed at a depth of 1 m and a spacing of 12 5 m two treatments fd and cd were implemented at the site four lateral drains were operated in fd mode and the other four were operated in cd mode the outer drains of each treatment were operated as guard drains to hydraulically isolate the two inner experimental drains the subsurface drains were connected to a solid main drain pipe that conveyed drainage water into a sump where it was pumped out of the field liu et al 2019 additionally plastic liners were buried to a depth of 1 5 m between swine lagoon and cd plots and between fd plots and the southern portion of the pasture field burchell et al 2005 the purpose of these liners was to hydraulically isolate the experimental field plots from the surrounding field area and the swine lagoon however there was no similar physical barrier between the fd and cd treatments tall fescue festuca arundinacea schreb and ryegrass lolium perenne l were grown at the field site which was irrigated using the effluent of an adjacent swine lagoon the irrigation rate was estimated by measuring the irrigation water depth at 17 different locations within the field using manual rain gauges precipitation was measured using two automatic rain gauges that were calibrated with manual measurement liu et al 2019 weather data required for estimating potential et pet including daily solar radiation maximum and minimum air temperatures relative humidity and wind speed were obtained from weather stations in close proximity to the experimental field less than 2 km away from the site liu et al 2019 subsurface drainage flow was measured every 10 min using v notch weirs installed inside control structures at the outlets of the lateral drains liu et al 2019 groundwater table depth midway between the experimental drain lines was measured every 60 min using pressure transducers hourly wtd measured at the end of each day was used to represent the daily value this representation is consistent with drainmod prediction of daily wtd which is based on end of day values the research field and the experimental procedure is described in detail by liu et al 2019 2 2 drainmod model description drainmod is a deterministic field scale process based one dimensional simulation model that was developed in late 1970 s to describe the hydrology of poorly drained and artificially drained soils skaggs et al 2012 drainmod has been widely used to quantify the performance of drainage and related water management systems e g youssef et al 2006 thorp et al 2009 ale et al 2009 luo et al 2010 skaggs et al 2010 salazar et al 2013 malota and senzanje 2015 wesström et al 2015 drainmod evolved over the years to become a whole system model capable of simulating the hydrologic carbon nitrogen and phosphorus cycles and vegetation growth and productivity for agricultural forest and grassland ecosystems on poorly drained high water table soils kandil et al 1992 youssef et al 2005 tian et al 2012 negm et al 2014 tian et al 2016 askar 2019 this study only used drainmod s hydrological component 2 2 1 water balance drainmod conducts two water balances one at the soil surface and one for the soil profile fig 2 water balance calculations are conducted for a soil column of unit surface area located midway between two parallel drains and extending from the soil surface down to an impermeable layer skaggs et al 2012 the model runs on hourly and daily time increments the water balance at the soil surface can be expressed as 1 p i r r f r o δ s s where p is precipitation cm irr is irrigation cm f is infiltration cm ro is surface runoff cm and δss is the change in water storage at the soil surface cm the water balance in the soil profile can be expressed as 2 v a d et vls f where δv a is the change in the water free pore space air volume of the soil section cm d is the subsurface drainage cm et is evapotranspiration cm and vls is vertical vs and or lateral seepage ls cm 2 2 2 evapotranspiration daily potential et pet can be calculated within drainmod using the temperature based thornthwaite method thornthwaite 1948 which requires daily maximum and minimum air temperatures alternatively model users can calculate daily pet using other methods and drainmod can read these daily pet values from an input file for each time increment modeled et is calculated based on pet and water availability in the plant root zone and the upward soil water flux if there is enough soil water to meet the et demand the modeled et is set as the pet otherwise modeled et becomes a fraction of the pet that is limited by the soil water supply skaggs et al 2012 2 2 3 infiltration surface runoff and subsurface drainage infiltration is calculated in drainmod using the green and ampt 1911 equation surface runoff is controlled by two depression storage parameters the maximum depression storage sm and kirkham s depth for flow to drains sl surface runoff occurs when sm is filled under this conditions δss in eq 1 becomes 0 and ro p irr f when depression storage is at or below sm and greater than sl surface water can move laterally across the soil surface under this condition subsurface drainage rate is calculated by kirkham s equation kirkham 1957 skaggs et al 2012 kirkham s equation is not applicable when ponding water depth drops below sl ponding water continues to draw down until the water table midway between the drains is coincident with the surface and water table profile between two drains attains an approximately elliptical shape the hooghoudt equation is used to calculate the subsurface drainage rate after surface ponding drops below s1 skaggs et al 2012 2 2 4 vertical and lateral seepage vertical and or lateral seepage are not uncommon in drained agricultural land the relative significance of seepage as a water balance component largely depends on soil properties the existence of a shallow restrictive or impermeable layer in the soil profile and the management of the drainage system e g controlled drainage vs free drainage darcy s law is used in drainmod to calculate vertical seepage flux the thickness dv and vertical hydraulic conductivity kv of the restrictive layer and the hydraulic head of the aquifer underneath that layer hv are the factors affecting the vertical seepage fig 3 in this section we provide a detailed description of modeling lateral seepage in drainmod since it has been identified as a key component of the water balance for the simulated field in this model application saraswat et al 2015 generally the model simulates lateral seepage flux from a drained field to a sink or from a source to a drained field herein drainmod modeling of lateral seepage is explained for the case that is relevant to this modeling study where groundwater is seeping laterally from a portion of a field under cd to an adjacent field portion under fd this condition is common to field experimental settings where the field is divided into smaller experimental field plots that are in close proximity and managed differently under these settings the interaction among adjacent field plots under different water management is unavoidable using the dupuit forchheimer d f assumptions the lateral seepage flux is calculated in drainmod by the dupuit equation eq 3 skaggs et al 2010 skaggs et al 2012 harr 1962 3 q l k l h 1 2 h 2 2 2 x a where q l is the lateral seepage flux that is the lateral seepage loss per unit area cm h 1 h 1 is the water level elevation at the seepage source cd treatment cm h 2 is the water level elevation at the sink fd treatment cm x is the distance between the boundary drains in the two fields cm a is the effective width of the source field cm and k l is the effective lateral hydraulic conductivity of the soil profile cm h 1 the lateral seepage equation programed into drainmod is 4 q l k l h 1 2 h 2 2 2 l r 2 where l r is the effective distance from drain to sink cm therefore l r can be expressed as 5 l r x a the term h 2 in eq 3 and eq 4 is also referred to as h r in drainmod literature in this paper we will use h r to denote h 2 2 3 modification of drainmod for reading dynamic hydraulic head of the groundwater source sink the standard version of drainmod uses a constant hydraulic head at the water source sink to calculate the lateral seepage flux which may not be accurate since the water table in drained agricultural fields is dynamic drainmod code was modified for this application to read the daily water table depth at the source sink field and use it as a dynamic hydraulic head h r for the lateral seepage calculations four input parameters are required for simulating lateral seepage by the standard version of the model three input parameters thickness of transmissive layer h d distance to receiving water l r and horizontal lateral hydraulic conductivity of the soil profile k l are used by both the standard and modified versions of the model the fourth input parameter of the standard version the hydraulic head of receiving water h r is replaced by a function of the observed daily water table depth which is read from an input file named seepls prn the use of constant h r value in this modeling application limited the predicted wtd to be always shallower than the difference between impermeable layer depth h and h r value this caused inconsistency between observed and predicted wtd during dry periods when observed wtd was lower than drain depth so daily dynamic h r values were used as input for drainmod simulation for both cd and fd plots for fd plots dynamic h r value could be calculated by eq 6 6 d y n a m i c h r f d h c d w t d d i f f where d y n a m i c h r f d is the dynamic h r in fd plots cm h is the depth from surface to impermeable layer cm cdwtd is the observed water table depth at cd plots cm and diff is a calibration parameter that represents the level of interaction between the fd treatment and the surrounding area a zero value of diff represents full interaction increasing the lateral seepage received by the fd treatment as the value of diff increases the lateral seepage received by the fd treatment decreases therefore the presence of guard drains and or plastic liners which minimize the interaction between the experimental drains of the fd treatment and the surrounding area is represented by increasing the diff value during the model calibration for this model application the diff value was calibrated as 15 0 cm to account for the interception of lateral seepage by the fd guard drains for cd plots dynamic h r value could be calculated by eq 7 and eq 8 7 dynamic hr cd h b if fdwtd b 8 dynamic hr cd h fdwtd if fdwtd b where d y n a m i c h r c d is the dynamic h r in cd plots cm fdwtd is the observed wtd at fd plots cm h is the depth from soil surface to impermeable layer cm b is the drain depth cm in this study the difference between h and b is 200 cm 2 4 statistical performance measures and evaluation criteria drainmod calibration was performed by comparing predicted and observed daily subsurface drainage fluxes and water table depth wtd the drainmod output of daily wtd represents the wtd at the end of each simulated day therefore the daily wtd predicted by the model was compared to hourly wtd measured at the end of each day statistical performance measures used to assess the accuracy of model predictions include the mean absolute error mae nash sutcliffe modeling efficiency nse and percent bias pbias or normalized percentage error npe eqs 9 11 youssef et al 2006 9 m a e i 1 n p i o i n 10 n s e i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n o i p i 2 i 1 n o

predicted pairs both nse and npe are not adequate measures for evaluating single event simulations since they are over sensitive to extreme values and less sensitive to low values moriasi et al 2015 so neither parameter was used to evaluate the agreement between observed and predicted daily flow volume for the cd treatment evaluation criteria for the level of agreement between drainmod predictions of drainage fluxes and water table depths and corresponding measurements are given by skaggs et al 2012 2 5 model parameterization 2 5 1 weather inputs measured hourly precipitation was used for drainmod hydrologic simulation of the artificially drained field during 2011 2014 daily pet was calculated using the fao56 penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 for cool season turfgrass meteorological data required for daily pet calculations were obtained from weather stations near the research site liu et al 2019 precipitation temperature and pet data were processed using drainmod s weather utility to generate the weather input files required by the model 2 5 2 drainage system inputs the subsurface drain depth and spacing at the field are used to parameterize the model the effective radius of drain lines and drainage coefficient values were set based on previous simulations of the same field burchell 2003 poole 2006 table 1 depth to impermeable layer was estimated based on field observation published literature for the cape fear soil series skaggs and nassehzadehtabrizi 1986 and previous model simulation of the field burchell 2003 maximum surface storage was set to represent fair surface drainage conditions skaggs 1980 table 1 the weir settings for the cd simulation are listed in table 1 2 5 3 soil inputs the soil water characteristic relationship table 1 and green ampt equation parameters table 1 were set to the same values used by burchell 2003 and poole 2006 during model calibration water table volume drained upward flux relationships table 1 were slightly modified from the original values the effective values of the lateral saturated hydraulic conductivity k sat for different soil layers were back calculated from hoogoughdt s equation based on observed relationship between subsurface drainage flux and water table depth q m skaggs et al 2008 skaggs et al 2012 liu et al 2017 the thickness and k sat values of different soil layers table 1 were adjusted until best agreement between predicted q m curve and observed q m data were obtained based on visual inspection of the plotted relationships fig 4 the procedure for estimating ksat from the q m releathership is described in detail by skaggs et al 2008 2 5 4 crop vegetation inputs the tabulated function of the effective rooting depth is the main plant related input to drainmod table 1 skaggs 1978 estimated the effective rooting depth as the depth containing 60 of root biomass both cool season grass tall fescue ryegrass and warm season grass weeds were grown in the experimental field a depth of 5 cm was set as the effective rooting depth during winter effective root depth of grasses was assumed to increase to 10 cm on march 1 and 15 cm on march 15 until early fall then effective rooting depth was set as 10 cm in mid fall and back to 5 cm in december the lower limit water content below which plant water uptake stops was initially set as 0 27 cm3 cm 3 and calibrated as 0 24 cm3 cm 3 2 5 5 seepage inputs controlled drainage raised the water table compared to that in adjacent plots in fd mode lateral seepage was assumed to occur from cd plots to guard drains adjacent to the fd plots therefore the constant value of h r standard version of drainmod 6 1 in cd plots was set equal to the height of the guard drain over the restrictive layer 200 cm the distance between the boundary drains drain spacing in cd and fd plots x is 1250 cm the effective width a of the source field cd plots is 5000 cm four times drain spacing thus the value of l r is 2500 cm eq 5 the thickness of the transmissive layer h d was assumed to be 0 and the effective horizontal hydraulic conductivity of the soil profile k l was determined by calibration table 1 the l r and k l values for fd plots were set the same as in cd plots the constant hydraulic head h r of source water for fd plots was initially estimated as the elevation of yearly mean wtd at cd plots above the restrictive layer and then calibrated as 215 cm table 1 the dynamic hydraulic head values were calculated for the fd plots using eq 6 with a calibrated diff value of 15 cm the dynamic hydraulic head values were calculated for the cd plots using eqs 7 and 8 2 5 6 model calibration and simulation strategy drainmod calibration was carried out by comparing measured and predicted daily wtd and subsurface drainage flux the goodness of fit between model predictions and field measurements was statically and visually evaluated initially the model was calibrated for fd condition without considering any seepage fdn scenario model calibration was conducted by adjusting the wtd volume drained vd and wtd upward flux relationships burchell 2003 poole 2006 effective rooting depth and lower limit of water content θ ll adjustments were made until the best fits between simulated and predicted wtd and subsurface drainage flux were achieved when we used the drainmod soil files developed by burchell 2003 for the cape fear soil series predicted wtd changed rapidly higher than observed values in wet periods and lower than observed values in drier periods when drainmod soil files of the same soil series developed by poole 2006 were used the predicted wtd was always higher than 120 cm the wtd vd relationship presented by poole 2006 was slightly modified during calibration it resulted in smaller drainable porosity f than given by poole for wtd greater than 90 cm and greater f than given by burchell for wtd less than 150 cm table 1 low drainable porosities are associated with flashy water table response to rainfall and drainage so greater f values result in smoother predicted changes in wtd the calibrated model for the fd treatment was used to simulate the field hydrology under the cd conditions without considering any seepage scenario cdn the model predicted substantially higher water table and subsurface drainage flux than observed for the cd treatment these predictions clearly indicated that seepage from the cd plots should be considered both vertical and lateral seepage were initially considered but vertical seepage was subsequently excluded because it influenced wtd and subsurface drainage predictions for both fd and cd treatments the vertical seepage flux that was necessary for acceptable wtd and subsurface drainage flux prediction for cd caused predicted wtd to be substantially lower and subsurface drainage to be substantially less than measured values for the fd treatment for this reason lateral seepage was identified as the main seepage mechanism that is driven by the interaction between the two adjacent treatments with different management cd vs fd controlled drainage plots were considered as the source of lateral seepage lateral seepage input parameters were then calibrated under cd condition hydraulic head of receiving water h r and distance to receiving water l r were determined as discussed in the previous section the horizontal hydraulic conductivity of the soil profile k l was calibrated by evaluating the goodness of fit between predicted and measured daily subsurface drainage flux and wtd then the same hydraulic conductivity value for lateral seepage was used under fd condition the model was calibrated with constant h r values as defined in the standard version of drainmod the simulation scenarios with constant h r for fd and cd were referred to as fdl conhr and cdl conhr respectively however a constant h r prevented the predicted wtd from dropping lower than the h r value which departed from the observed wtd in dry periods therefore drainmod code was modified to read in dynamic h r as previously described the simulation scenarios with dynamic h r for fd and cd were referred to as fdl dynhr and cdl dynhr respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 model simulations of the free drainage treatment first drainmod simulated the hydrology of the fd plots with and without seepage measured water table in fd plots was always deeper than the water table in the adjacent cd plots and the naturally drained portion of the field creating a hydraulic gradient for lateral seepage from the cd plots and from the undrained field to the fd plots the plastic curtain buried between fd plots and the adjacent naturally drained portion of the field was only buried to 1 5 m depth so groundwater could possibly seep underneath the curtain guard lines were installed between fd and cd plots to isolate the center experimental drain lines of both the fd and cd plots from seepage effects however seepage from cd plots and nearby naturally drained field area to the fd plots could still have occurred graphical representation of results fig 5 showed that daily predicted wtd matched measured wtd with varying levels of agreement for the fd treatment under the three scenarios fdn fdl conhr and fdl dynhr the hydrologic simulations of the fd treatment without considering seepage or with considering seepage and constant h r resulted in poor daily wtd predictions during the dry summer periods of 2011 and 2014 when the measured water table dropped much deeper than predicted simulation result of the fdl conhr scenario was even worse than fdn in dry months since the constant h r value prevented the model from dropping the water table beyond a specific depth based on the constant h r value the hydrologic simulation of the fd treatment with seepage and dynamic h r generally improved the goodness of fit between daily predicted and measured wtd particularly during the dry months fig 5 according to model evaluation criteria suggested by skaggs et al 2012 the mae for predicting daily wtd in the range of 6 5 19 2 cm table 2 indicates excellent to acceptable agreement for the three scenarios best agreement between daily predicted and observed wtd lowest mae and highest nse values was found under fdl dynhr scenario compared to the other two scenarios on average over the 4 yr simulation period the mae and nse for predicted water table under the fdl dynhr were 6 9 cm and 0 79 respectively table 2 the agreement between daily predicted and observed wtd under fdn was better than fdl conhr the agreement between predicted and measured daily subsurface drainage rates whether seepage was considered or not was also acceptable to excellent as indicated graphically fig 5 and statistically table 3 overall the mae nse and npe values were significantly improved under the fdl dynhr scenario consideration of lateral seepage with dynamic h r improved agreement between predicted and measured daily drainage volumes in all years on average over the 4 yr simulation period the fdl dynhr scenario had the smallest mae 0 52 mm and largest nse 0 76 for predicting daily subsurface drainage rates compared to the fdn mae 0 60 mm nse 0 70 and fdl conhr mae 0 65 mm nse 0 69 scenarios table 3 according to performance criteria suggested by skaggs et al 2012 drainmod well predicted cumulative drainage outflows for the free drainage treatment over the 4 yr simulation period fig 5 the timing and magnitude of most flow events were well simulated for the three scenarios especially for the fdl dynhr scenario as indicated by the npe values in table 3 drainmod over predicted yearly drainage flow volume in 2011 predicted drainage volumes were close to observed in 2012 and 2013 and under predicted yearly drainage flow volume in 2014 for fdn and fdl conhr scenarios fig 5 under fdl dynhr scenario drainmod under predicted the cumulative drainage in 2011 npe 15 8 however the predicted drainage volumes were very close to observation during 2012 2014 npe range 3 6 to 1 6 therefore the consideration of seepage under fdl dynhr improved the agreement between predicted and measured cumulative drainage flow over the four periods of observation the simulation of two pump failure events simulation mode was changed to controlled drainage to simulate pump failure in late march and late august 2011 caused the major disagreement of predicted and observed wtd and drainage volume for all three scenarios the fdl dynhr scenario minimized the disagreement between predicted and observed cumulative drainage flow during these two pump failure events another case of fdl dynhr scenario increasing the agreement between predicted and measured drainage volume occurred during late january to early february 2014 when heavy snow occurred fig 5 3 2 model simulations of the controlled drainage treatment under cd subsurface drainage could only occur when the water table was closer to the surface than control level imposed in the study 36 cm below ground surface most of the time this resulted in only a few flow events in each year for example there were only two flow events of measurable magnitude in 2011 fig 6 such infrequent flow could be characterized as single flow events the calibrated model for the fdn scenario was used to simulate the hydrology of cd treatment without lateral seepage cdn scenario a cursory review of the results clearly shows the importance of considering seepage in quantifying the hydrology of this site under cd fig 6 for example the average predicted wtd for the 4 year study period under cdn scenario was 51 9 cm when seepage was not considered versus 80 4 cm observed table 4 the total predicted drainage for the four years was 123 7 cm under cdn scenario versus only 11 5 cm observed that is ignoring lateral seepage would have resulted in overprediction of drainage outflows by about a factor of 10 fig 6 the other statistics summarized in tables 4 and 5 and results plotted in fig 6 indicate very poor agreement between daily observed and predicted wtd and drainage flow when seepage was not considered when lateral seepage was considered especially under the cdl dynhr scenario the agreement between predicted and observed results was much improved prediction of daily wtd was in acceptable to excellent agreement with measured values as quantified by mae nse and pbias over the four year observation period under the cdl conhr and cdl dynhr table 4 annual cd drainage flow volume was over predicted by a minimum of 15 mm in 2011 and a maximum of 61 mm in 2012 when lateral seepage was considered table 5 while predicted drainage flows were about a factor of two greater than measured for the observation period the timing of most flow events was captured by drainmod and the total predicted drain flow was much closer to measured compared to model predictions without considering lateral seepage consideration of lateral seepage accounted for most of the difference in drainage volumes between the fd and cd treatments differences between daily predicted and observed wtd and daily flow volume were smallest in 2013 which was the only year that the drainage outlet was adjusted before wastewater irrigation the weir level was lowered 4 8 days to partially drain the soil profile prior to the two irrigation events in 2013 the weirs were raised back to their original elevations just prior to irrigation this action may have been at least partially responsible for producing the most annual drainage water of the four years of observation the weir depths were adjusted in the model inputs and drainmod successfully simulated the wtd and daily drainage flow volume during these periods as shown in fig 6 predicted wtd from jan to mar 2014 was deeper than observed for both fd and cd plots fig 6 a possible reason for these differences was an error in the measured precipitation which was primarily snowfall during the period jan 22 to feb 12 the rain gauges installed in the field were designed to measure rainfall and may not have recorded snowfall accurately there were four snowfall events from jan 22 to feb 12 2014 the snow depths were 3 8 8 9 3 3 and 1 3 cm on jan 22 jan 29 feb 11 and feb 12 respectively the average daily minimum air temperature from jan 20 to feb 23 was 1 5 c and it took 3 5 days for the minimum air temperature to rise above 0 c after each snowfall thus the snow melted slowly during this period the recorded precipitation at the experimental site was 6 4 cm 1 9 cm less than recorded precipitation at a weather station 2 2 km away from the experimental site 3 3 water balance components for free and controlled drainage treatments consideration of lateral seepage and dynamic h r fdl dynhr scenario improved the agreement between predicted and observed subsurface drainage flux for the fd treatment by only 1 2 cm yr 1 on average over the 4 yr simulation period table 6 the model predicted that the fd treatment received on average 0 9 cm yr 1 from the surrounding areas of the field including the cd plots and the naturally drained area fdl dynhr scenario consideration of lateral seepage did not influence predicted et and ro for the fd treatment the model predicted on average a less than 1 0 cm difference in et and almost no difference in ro for the fd treatment with and without lateral seepage table 6 the model predicted substantial runoff 17 9 cm from fd plots in 2011 there was no predicted runoff in years 2013 and 2014 and only 2 8 cm in 2012 lateral seepage did not influence the water balance for the experimental plots of the fd treatment this is evidenced by the small amount of lateral seepage predicted by the model for the fd treatment 2 7 cm yr 1 for dl conhr and 0 9 cm yr 1 for fdl dynhr and further supported by the overall satisfactory agreement between predicted and observed wtd and subsurface drainage for the fd treatment even without considering lateral seepage in the simulation this indicates that the outer guard drain lines of the fd treatment intercepted the majority of the lateral seepage flux from the cd treatment and the naturally drained field area thus the outer guard drains were effective in hydraulically isolating the inner experimental drains of the fd treatment it should be noted that the guard drain lines were not instrumented to measure the subsurface drainage outflow in order to estimate the lateral seepage intercepted by the guard drains in contrast to fd model predictions clearly showed the importance of considering seepage and dynamic h r scenario cdl dynhr for the water balance of the cd treatment table 4 drainmod predicted that considering lateral seepage substantially altered the water balance for the cd treatment it dramatically reduced the difference between average predicted and observed annual subsurface drainage flux from as high as 28 1 cm to only 2 7 cm it also reduced average annual predicted et from 80 6 to 77 1 cm and ro from 9 1 to 5 7 cm the reduction in predicted d et and ro was caused by the lateral seepage from cd plots to the surrounding area of the field predicted annual subsurface drainage flux from cd plots cdl dynhr scenario only represented 9 16 of that from fd plots fdl dynhr scenario predicted annual subsurface drainage for the fdl dynhr scenario ranged from 20 7 cm to 53 6 cm compared to a range of 2 1 8 1 cm for the cdl dynhr scenario table 6 enhanced annual et by cd was no more than 1 5 cm the year 2013 and the increase in annual ro was no more than 1 4 cm the year 2012 therefore lateral seepage accounted for approximately 96 of the reduction in subsurface drainage by cd lateral seepage from cd plots is an important pathway since nutrients could potentially be transported with seepage water theoretically lateral seepage could occur through all saturated soil profile in cd plots however the magnitude of the lateral seepage passing through each soil layer is greatly influenced by the hydraulic conductivity and relative position of that layer field investigations gilliam et al 1979 liu et al 2019 indicated the presence of a loamy sand layer at a depth of 135 210 cm with a hydraulic conductivity that is nearly 10 times higher than the soil layers just above and below it liu et al 2019 estimated that 74 7 of total lateral seepage from cd plots to adjacent field area occurred through this loamy sand layer nitrate n was the major form of nitrogen in shallow groundwater at the experimental site liu et al 2019 nitrate concentration was reduced from shallow to deep soil layers with a more pronounced reduction for cd plots mainly because of enhanced denitrification in the field liu et al 2019 so even though lateral seepage from cd plots to other portions of the field may have occurred it is hypothesized that the seeping water only transported relatively small amounts of nitrate from cd plots to other portions of the filed through the sand layer 135 210 cm however this conclusion may not be generalized to other field conditions where lateral seepage flux has relatively high no3 n concentration in contrast to fd model predictions indicated that the outer guard drains surrounding the inner experimental drains of the cd treatment were not effective in hydraulically isolating the treatment and reducing lateral seepage from the cd plots to the adjacent field area the significance of lateral seepage from the cd field plots primarily depends on three factors the transmissivity of the soil profile the management protocol of the drainage control structure and the size of the cd field plots the presence of the loamy sand layer with higher hydraulic conductivity the shallow management depth of the drainage control structure and small size of the cd field plots all contributed to high lateral seepage flux from the cd treatment to the adjacent field area the drain line at the edge of fd plots guard fd1 fig 1 was the nearest sink not the only sink for seepage water from cd plots as previously stated the subsurface drainage flux and drainage water quality for the guard lines were never monitored during the 4 yr experiment if the guard line of fd plots was one of the sinks for lateral seepage from cd plots subsurface drainage flow from this guard line would be continuously greater than the drainage flow from center lines of fd plots and the nitrate n concentration in drainage water leaving via the guard line of fd plots might also be lower than center lines of fd plot dilution effect monitoring guard lines of fd plots would be useful to evaluate the effect of lateral seepage on nutrient transport from managed cd to non managed fd portions of the drained field 3 4 implications this modeling study demonstrated the power of process based simulation models such as drainmod for interpreting and explaining data of experimental studies well coordinated experimental and modeling research can advance our understanding of mechanisms and processes influencing the behavior of the system being investigated the experimental study by liu et al 2019 showed that cd substantially reduced subsurface drainage flow but did not determine the fate of the water that did not drain out from the field plots because of implementing cd understanding the fate of this water is fundamental in determining the fate of nitrogen as affected by drainage water management the performance of cd in reducing nitrogen loss from artificially drained agricultural fields is strongly influenced by the presence of seepage and the nitrate concentration of the seeping water therefore the performance of cd reported in the literature determined merely by the reduction in nitrogen mass loading in drainage water is likely higher than the actual performance of the practice the difference between the apparent and actual performances of the practice depends on several factors including layering of the soil profile size and boundary conditions of the field area under cd and drain outlet management protocol all of these factors influence the amount of seepage and nitrate concentration in shallow groundwater and subsequently influence water and nitrogen balances in drained agricultural land in this modeling study drainmod predicted significant interaction between field plots in cd mode and other portions of the field including field plots in fd and the naturally drained area as a result the model predicted that over 90 of the water that did not drain out from the field via the drainage system due to cd seeped laterally from the cd plots to the surrounding field areas despite the significance of the lateral seepage pathway it was concluded that the difference between the apparent and actual performances of cd in reducing n export was not as big because seepage water had relatively low nitrate concentration as reported by liu et al 2019 however this conclusion cannot be generalized to other field conditions in experimental research different water table management treatments e g free drainage controlled drainage subirrigation are usually implemented on small size field plots despite attempts to hydraulically isolate adjacent experimental plots interaction among plots with different treatments is inevitable modeling this interaction and its effect on the water and nutrient balances is difficult and requires availability of specific experimental data that are not frequently measured we intentionally provided a detailed description of our modeling approach as a guidance for drainmod model users when modeling lateral seepage as affected by interaction between experimental plots under free and controlled drainage this modeling framework was possible because of the adequate field measurements including subsurface drainage outflow and water table depth for both fd and cd treatments liu et al 2019 lastly this modeling study clearly shows the importance of using proper model calibration strategies skaggs et al 2012 daggupati et al 2015 model users seeking to model the long term impacts of cd on water and nitrogen balances in artificially drained agricultural land should be careful not to conduct model simulations without proper model calibration this modeling study shows that an acceptable to excellent performance of the model for simulating one management scenario e g free drainage does not necessarily mean that the model will have a comparable performance for a different scenario e g controlled drainage if model users are planning to simulate the hydrology and nitrogen dynamics under both free and controlled drainage using a calibrated model for both drainage management scenarios is highly recommended and less likely to make erroneous predictions compared to using a model that is only calibrated against data from only one scenario e g free drainage in this study one can argue that the first set of drainmod simulations of the hydrology of the fd field plots which did not consider the seepage effect at all have a good enough performance based on statistical and graphical evaluations had the model calibration stopped at this point it would have produced a calibrated model that did not adequately represent the different hydrologic processes which leads to serious errors in predicting the effect of cd on field hydrology and n dynamics in the field arnold et al 2015 discussed the importance of proper representation of different hydrologic processes for reliable modeling of system s hydrologic response to changes in land use and management practices 4 conclusions the water management model drainmod successfully simulated the hydrology of a subsurface drained field in eastern north carolina u s that had two side by side experimental field plots operated in free drainage fd and controlled drainage cd results of the simulations strongly suggested that lateral seepage was an important component of the water balance for the cd treatment the standard version of drainmod assumes the hydraulic head h r that drives the lateral seepage to be constant throughout the simulation simulation using the standard drainmod that considered lateral seepage with constant h r generally improved the agreement between predicted and observed wtd and daily subsurface drainage flux for cd plots however it increased the disagreement between predicted and observed wtd in dry months for both fd and cd simulation using a modified drainmod code that considered lateral seepage with dynamic h r achieved the best agreement between predicted and observed wtd and daily subsurface drainage fluxes for both fd and cd plots in contrast to cd simulation results showed acceptable to excellent agreement between predicted and observed wtd and daily drainage volume for fd plots both with and without considering seepage this indicates that the magnitude of lateral seepage received by the experimental drain lines of the fd treatment was small thus the outer guard drain lines were effective in hydraulically isolating the inner experimental drain lines of fd treatment fig 1 by intercepting lateral seepage from adjacent cd treatment and adjacent naturally drained field area on average over the 4 year simulation period measured annual subsurface drainage from cd plots was less than 7 of that observed in fd plots 2 9 cm for cd vs 42 6 cm for fd simulation results showed that 96 of the reduction in subsurface drainage flux by cd could be attributed to lateral seepage on average drainmod predicted yearly lateral seepage of 33 0 cm according to model predictions cd increased annual et by no more than 1 1 cm yr 1 runoff ro was also increased but by no more than 0 5 cm yr 1 during the 4 yr period of observation the main contributing factors for the substantial lateral seepage flux that occurred at the cd fd boundary were the presence of a sandy layer with high hydraulic conductivity at 135 210 cm depth the shallow management depth of the drainage control structure 36 cm deep all year round and the relatively small size of the experimental plots in contrast to fd treatment the outer guard drain lines of the cd treatment fig 1 were not effective in providing hydraulic isolation of the experimental cd drains and reducing the lateral seepage from cd to fd and other adjacent field areas this study underscores the importance of using process based models such as drainmod to investigate key processes and mechanisms influencing the hydrology and water balance for subsurface drained agricultural land the approach presented in this paper can be used as a modeling framework by drainmod model users to assess the significance of lateral seepage when conducting field and plot scale experimental studies investigating the hydrologic and water quality impacts of cd based on the presented approach and results of the simulations calibrating drainmod using data from only one management scenario e g fd may lead to erroneous model predictions under a different management scenario e g cd if the model were to be applied for simulating both fd and cd

10023,we demonstrated a drainmod modeling framework to predict controlled drainage cd effect on the fate of water in artificially drained agricultural fields which is key for determining the water quality benefits of the practice to demonstrate this modeling framework drainmod simulated the hydrology of a subsurface drained grass field in eastern north carolina u s under both free drainage fd and cd three scenarios were simulated for each water management no lateral seepage ls and ls with constant and dynamic hydraulic head hr for each scenario predicted water table depth wtd and subsurface drainage were compared to observed values using mean absolute error nash sutcliffe efficiency and normalized percent error predicted water balance components for different scenarios were also investigated results clearly showed that ls was a significant component of the water balance for cd model predictions showed that 96 of the reduction in subsurface drainage due to cd could be attributed to ls 33 5 cm yr 1 the large values of ls predicted by the model were attributed to the presence of a permeable sandy layer in the soil profile the shallow management depth of the drain outlet and the small size of the experimental field plots agreement between predicted and observed wtd and subsurface drainage ranged from acceptable to excellent for fd with and without considering ls in contrast drainmod simulations for cd yielded acceptable predictions only for the scenario considering ls with dynamic hr this study demonstrated the power of process based simulation models such as drainmod for interpreting and explaining data of experimental studies and underscored the importance of using a proper model calibration strategy for yielding reliable predictions this study

drained agricultural fields keywords drainage water management drainmod water table management agricultural drainage hydrologic modeling 1 introduction controlled drainage cd is a water management

fields to receiving surface water bodies skaggs et al 2010 early studies in north carolina u s showed that cd reduced both drainage flow and n loss by almost the same percentage e g gilliam et al 1979 skaggs and gilliam 1981 evans et al 1995 in ontario canada cd reduced n losses from a corn soybean rotation on a subsurface drained clay loam soil by 44 and 31 under two n fertilization rates drury et al 2009 helmers et al 2012 reported that cd reduced drain flow and n loading on average by 37 and 36 in iowa jaynes 2012 reported in another study in iowa that cd reduced subsurface drain flow by 21 and n loading by 29 poole et al 2018 attributed n load reduction 30 to a reduction in drainage flow 33 and increase in crop yield 11 for corn and 10 for soybean in a 9 year study in eastern north carolina controlled drainage tends to increase evapotranspiration et surface runoff ro vertical and or lateral seepage vls compared to free drainage fd with continuously open drain outlets skaggs et al 2010 youssef et al 2018 skaggs et al 2010 pointed out that if total water loss from a subsurface drained field ro plus subsurface drainage d was reduced by cd by more than 20 seepage vls may have been an important factor in the reduction skaggs et al 2010 also stated that the increase in et caused by cd might not be greater than 10 they noted that the effect of lateral seepage through field boundaries becomes more pronounced as the area of the field in cd mode gets smaller and the influence of the boundary conditions becomes greater understanding the effect of cd on field hydrology and different water balance components is key to understanding the effect of the practice on n fate and transport in artificially drained cropland researchers have been looking for ways to estimate water balance components in subsurface drained fields using field observations of water table depth wtd drainage flow rate and weather data to calibrate computer simulation models such as drainmod skaggs et al 2010 can help estimate different components of the water balance for experimental fields and subsequently help answer the questions related to the fate of the water as affected by cd drainmod has been used to simulate water balance components including vertical seepage in several studies in united states and canada ale et al 2009 bourke 2012 chang et al 1983 negm et al 2017 youssef et al 2018 for example ale et al 2009 compared drainmod simulated water balances for a drained field in indiana u s under cd and fd scenarios and estimated that 68 of simulated reduction in drainage flow by cd went to enhanced vertical seepage a four year experimental study carried out in eastern north carolina on an artificially drained pasture field receiving swine lagoon effluent has shown that cd substantially reduced subsurface drainage flow by over 90 when compared to fd liu et al 2019 the large percent reduction in drainage flow raised an important question where did the water normally drained via the continuously opened subsurface drains fd go when the system is operated in cd mode we conducted a drainmod modeling study to investigate the effect of cd on field water balance and estimate the fate of the water that did not leave the field via subsurface drainage because of cd implementation the approach presented in this study can be used by drainmod users as framework for simulating lateral seepage caused by cd 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the experimental site the experimental site 35 51 11 3 n 76 39 31 1 w is an artificially drained pasture field located in the lower coastal plain of the state of north carolina u s the site has an elevation of 6 4 m above mean sea level and a slope of 0 07 burchell et al 2005 liu et al 2019 the soil at the site is a poorly drained cape fear loam gilliam et al 1979 according to soil survey data nrcs 2015 and field investigations there are five distinct soil layers extending from the soil surface down to an impervious layer at an estimated depth of 300 cm loam 0 35 cm clay 35 105 cm sandy clay loam 105 135 cm sand 135 210 cm sandy clay 210 300 cm the geographic location and the layout of the experimental field are shown in fig 1 the drainage system at the site consists of eight lateral subsurface drain lines installed at a depth of 1 m and a spacing of 12 5 m two treatments fd and cd were implemented at the site four lateral drains were operated in fd mode and the other four were operated in cd mode the outer drains of each treatment were operated as guard drains to hydraulically isolate the two inner experimental drains the subsurface drains were connected to a solid main drain pipe that conveyed drainage water into a sump where it was pumped out of the field liu et al 2019 additionally plastic liners were buried to a depth of 1 5 m between swine lagoon and cd plots and between fd plots and the southern portion of the pasture field burchell et al 2005 the purpose of these liners was to hydraulically isolate the experimental field plots from the surrounding field area and the swine lagoon however there was no similar physical barrier between the fd and cd treatments tall fescue festuca arundinacea schreb and ryegrass lolium perenne l were grown at the field site which was irrigated using the effluent of an adjacent swine lagoon the irrigation rate was estimated by measuring the irrigation water depth at 17 different locations within the field using manual rain gauges precipitation was measured using two automatic rain gauges that were calibrated with manual measurement liu et al 2019 weather data required for estimating potential et pet including daily solar radiation maximum and minimum air temperatures relative humidity and wind speed were obtained from weather stations in close proximity to the experimental field less than 2 km away from the site liu et al 2019 subsurface drainage flow was measured every 10 min using v notch weirs installed inside control structures at the outlets of the lateral drains liu et al 2019 groundwater table depth midway between the experimental drain lines was measured every 60 min using pressure transducers hourly wtd measured at the end of each day was used to represent the daily value this representation is consistent with drainmod prediction of daily wtd which is based on end of day values the research field and the experimental procedure is described in detail by liu et al 2019 2 2 drainmod model description drainmod is a deterministic field scale process based one dimensional simulation model that was developed in late 1970 s to describe the hydrology of poorly drained and artificially drained soils skaggs et al 2012 drainmod has been widely used to quantify the performance of drainage and related water management systems e g youssef et al 2006 thorp et al 2009 ale et al 2009 luo et al 2010 skaggs et al 2010 salazar et al 2013 malota and senzanje 2015 wesström et al 2015 drainmod evolved over the years to become a whole system model capable of simulating the hydrologic carbon nitrogen and phosphorus cycles and vegetation growth and productivity for agricultural forest and grassland ecosystems on poorly drained high water table soils kandil et al 1992 youssef et al 2005 tian et al 2012 negm et al 2014 tian et al 2016 askar 2019 this study only used drainmod s hydrological component 2 2 1 water balance drainmod conducts two water balances one at the soil surface and one for the soil profile fig 2 water balance calculations are conducted for a soil column of unit surface area located midway between two parallel drains and extending from the soil surface down to an impermeable layer skaggs et al 2012 the model runs on hourly and daily time increments the water balance at the soil surface can be expressed as 1 p i r r f r o δ s s where p is precipitation cm irr is irrigation cm f is infiltration cm ro is surface runoff cm and δss is the change in water storage at the soil surface cm the water balance in the soil profile can be expressed as 2 v a d et vls f where δv a is the change in the water free pore space air volume of the soil section cm d is the subsurface drainage cm et is evapotranspiration cm and vls is vertical vs and or lateral seepage ls cm 2 2 2 evapotranspiration daily potential et pet can be calculated within drainmod using the temperature based thornthwaite method thornthwaite 1948 which requires daily maximum and minimum air temperatures alternatively model users can calculate daily pet using other methods and drainmod can read these daily pet values from an input file for each time increment modeled et is calculated based on pet and water availability in the plant root zone and the upward soil water flux if there is enough soil water to meet the et demand the modeled et is set as the pet otherwise modeled et becomes a fraction of the pet that is limited by the soil water supply skaggs et al 2012 2 2 3 infiltration surface runoff and subsurface drainage infiltration is calculated in drainmod using the green and ampt 1911 equation surface runoff is controlled by two depression storage parameters the maximum depression storage sm and kirkham s depth for flow to drains sl surface runoff occurs when sm is filled under this conditions δss in eq 1 becomes 0 and ro p irr f when depression storage is at or below sm and greater than sl surface water can move laterally across the soil surface under this condition subsurface drainage rate is calculated by kirkham s equation kirkham 1957 skaggs et al 2012 kirkham s equation is not applicable when ponding water depth drops below sl ponding water continues to draw down until the water table midway between the drains is coincident with the surface and water table profile between two drains attains an approximately elliptical shape the hooghoudt equation is used to calculate the subsurface drainage rate after surface ponding drops below s1 skaggs et al 2012 2 2 4 vertical and lateral seepage vertical and or lateral seepage are not uncommon in drained agricultural land the relative significance of seepage as a water balance component largely depends on soil properties the existence of a shallow restrictive or impermeable layer in the soil profile and the management of the drainage system e g controlled drainage vs free drainage darcy s law is used in drainmod to calculate vertical seepage flux the thickness dv and vertical hydraulic conductivity kv of the restrictive layer and the hydraulic head of the aquifer underneath that layer hv are the factors affecting the vertical seepage fig 3 in this section we provide a detailed description of modeling lateral seepage in drainmod since it has been identified as a key component of the water balance for the simulated field in this model application saraswat et al 2015 generally the model simulates lateral seepage flux from a drained field to a sink or from a source to a drained field herein drainmod modeling of lateral seepage is explained for the case that is relevant to this modeling study where groundwater is seeping laterally from a portion of a field under cd to an adjacent field portion under fd this condition is common to field experimental settings where the field is divided into smaller experimental field plots that are in close proximity and managed differently under these settings the interaction among adjacent field plots under different water management is unavoidable using the dupuit forchheimer d f assumptions the lateral seepage flux is calculated in drainmod by the dupuit equation eq 3 skaggs et al 2010 skaggs et al 2012 harr 1962 3 q l k l h 1 2 h 2 2 2 x a where q l is the lateral seepage flux that is the lateral seepage loss per unit area cm h 1 h 1 is the water level elevation at the seepage source cd treatment cm h 2 is the water level elevation at the sink fd treatment cm x is the distance between the boundary drains in the two fields cm a is the effective width of the source field cm and k l is the effective lateral hydraulic conductivity of the soil profile cm h 1 the lateral seepage equation programed into drainmod is 4 q l k l h 1 2 h 2 2 2 l r 2 where l r is the effective distance from drain to sink cm therefore l r can be expressed as 5 l r x a the term h 2 in eq 3 and eq 4 is also referred to as h r in drainmod literature in this paper we will use h r to denote h 2 2 3 modification of drainmod for reading dynamic hydraulic head of the groundwater source sink the standard version of drainmod uses a constant hydraulic head at the water source sink to calculate the lateral seepage flux which may not be accurate since the water table in drained agricultural fields is dynamic drainmod code was modified for this application to read the daily water table depth at the source sink field and use it as a dynamic hydraulic head h r for the lateral seepage calculations four input parameters are required for simulating lateral seepage by the standard version of the model three input parameters thickness of transmissive layer h d distance to receiving water l r and horizontal lateral hydraulic conductivity of the soil profile k l are used by both the standard and modified versions of the model the fourth input parameter of the standard version the hydraulic head of receiving water h r is replaced by a function of the observed daily water table depth which is read from an input file named seepls prn the use of constant h r value in this modeling application limited the predicted wtd to be always shallower than the difference between impermeable layer depth h and h r value this caused inconsistency between observed and predicted wtd during dry periods when observed wtd was lower than drain depth so daily dynamic h r values were used as input for drainmod simulation for both cd and fd plots for fd plots dynamic h r value could be calculated by eq 6 6 d y n a m i c h r f d h c d w t d d i f f where d y n a m i c h r f d is the dynamic h r in fd plots cm h is the depth from surface to impermeable layer cm cdwtd is the observed water table depth at cd plots cm and diff is a calibration parameter that represents the level of interaction between the fd treatment and the surrounding area a zero value of diff represents full interaction increasing the lateral seepage received by the fd treatment as the value of diff increases the lateral seepage received by the fd treatment decreases therefore the presence of guard drains and or plastic liners which minimize the interaction between the experimental drains of the fd treatment and the surrounding area is represented by increasing the diff value during the model calibration for this model application the diff value was calibrated as 15 0 cm to account for the interception of lateral seepage by the fd guard drains for cd plots dynamic h r value could be calculated by eq 7 and eq 8 7 dynamic hr cd h b if fdwtd b 8 dynamic hr cd h fdwtd if fdwtd b where d y n a m i c h r c d is the dynamic h r in cd plots cm fdwtd is the observed wtd at fd plots cm h is the depth from soil surface to impermeable layer cm b is the drain depth cm in this study the difference between h and b is 200 cm 2 4 statistical performance measures and evaluation criteria drainmod calibration was performed by comparing predicted and observed daily subsurface drainage fluxes and water table depth wtd the drainmod output of daily wtd represents the wtd at the end of each simulated day therefore the daily wtd predicted by the model was compared to hourly wtd measured at the end of each day statistical performance measures used to assess the accuracy of model predictions include the mean absolute error mae nash sutcliffe modeling efficiency nse and percent bias pbias or normalized percentage error npe eqs 9 11 youssef et al 2006 9 m a e i 1 n p i o i n 10 n s e i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n o i p i 2 i 1 n o

predicted pairs both nse and npe are not adequate measures for evaluating single event simulations since they are over sensitive to extreme values and less sensitive to low values moriasi et al 2015 so neither parameter was used to evaluate the agreement between observed and predicted daily flow volume for the cd treatment evaluation criteria for the level of agreement between drainmod predictions of drainage fluxes and water table depths and corresponding measurements are given by skaggs et al 2012 2 5 model parameterization 2 5 1 weather inputs measured hourly precipitation was used for drainmod hydrologic simulation of the artificially drained field during 2011 2014 daily pet was calculated using the fao56 penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 for cool season turfgrass meteorological data required for daily pet calculations were obtained from weather stations near the research site liu et al 2019 precipitation temperature and pet data were processed using drainmod s weather utility to generate the weather input files required by the model 2 5 2 drainage system inputs the subsurface drain depth and spacing at the field are used to parameterize the model the effective radius of drain lines and drainage coefficient values were set based on previous simulations of the same field burchell 2003 poole 2006 table 1 depth to impermeable layer was estimated based on field observation published literature for the cape fear soil series skaggs and nassehzadehtabrizi 1986 and previous model simulation of the field burchell 2003 maximum surface storage was set to represent fair surface drainage conditions skaggs 1980 table 1 the weir settings for the cd simulation are listed in table 1 2 5 3 soil inputs the soil water characteristic relationship table 1 and green ampt equation parameters table 1 were set to the same values used by burchell 2003 and poole 2006 during model calibration water table volume drained upward flux relationships table 1 were slightly modified from the original values the effective values of the lateral saturated hydraulic conductivity k sat for different soil layers were back calculated from hoogoughdt s equation based on observed relationship between subsurface drainage flux and water table depth q m skaggs et al 2008 skaggs et al 2012 liu et al 2017 the thickness and k sat values of different soil layers table 1 were adjusted until best agreement between predicted q m curve and observed q m data were obtained based on visual inspection of the plotted relationships fig 4 the procedure for estimating ksat from the q m releathership is described in detail by skaggs et al 2008 2 5 4 crop vegetation inputs the tabulated function of the effective rooting depth is the main plant related input to drainmod table 1 skaggs 1978 estimated the effective rooting depth as the depth containing 60 of root biomass both cool season grass tall fescue ryegrass and warm season grass weeds were grown in the experimental field a depth of 5 cm was set as the effective rooting depth during winter effective root depth of grasses was assumed to increase to 10 cm on march 1 and 15 cm on march 15 until early fall then effective rooting depth was set as 10 cm in mid fall and back to 5 cm in december the lower limit water content below which plant water uptake stops was initially set as 0 27 cm3 cm 3 and calibrated as 0 24 cm3 cm 3 2 5 5 seepage inputs controlled drainage raised the water table compared to that in adjacent plots in fd mode lateral seepage was assumed to occur from cd plots to guard drains adjacent to the fd plots therefore the constant value of h r standard version of drainmod 6 1 in cd plots was set equal to the height of the guard drain over the restrictive layer 200 cm the distance between the boundary drains drain spacing in cd and fd plots x is 1250 cm the effective width a of the source field cd plots is 5000 cm four times drain spacing thus the value of l r is 2500 cm eq 5 the thickness of the transmissive layer h d was assumed to be 0 and the effective horizontal hydraulic conductivity of the soil profile k l was determined by calibration table 1 the l r and k l values for fd plots were set the same as in cd plots the constant hydraulic head h r of source water for fd plots was initially estimated as the elevation of yearly mean wtd at cd plots above the restrictive layer and then calibrated as 215 cm table 1 the dynamic hydraulic head values were calculated for the fd plots using eq 6 with a calibrated diff value of 15 cm the dynamic hydraulic head values were calculated for the cd plots using eqs 7 and 8 2 5 6 model calibration and simulation strategy drainmod calibration was carried out by comparing measured and predicted daily wtd and subsurface drainage flux the goodness of fit between model predictions and field measurements was statically and visually evaluated initially the model was calibrated for fd condition without considering any seepage fdn scenario model calibration was conducted by adjusting the wtd volume drained vd and wtd upward flux relationships burchell 2003 poole 2006 effective rooting depth and lower limit of water content θ ll adjustments were made until the best fits between simulated and predicted wtd and subsurface drainage flux were achieved when we used the drainmod soil files developed by burchell 2003 for the cape fear soil series predicted wtd changed rapidly higher than observed values in wet periods and lower than observed values in drier periods when drainmod soil files of the same soil series developed by poole 2006 were used the predicted wtd was always higher than 120 cm the wtd vd relationship presented by poole 2006 was slightly modified during calibration it resulted in smaller drainable porosity f than given by poole for wtd greater than 90 cm and greater f than given by burchell for wtd less than 150 cm table 1 low drainable porosities are associated with flashy water table response to rainfall and drainage so greater f values result in smoother predicted changes in wtd the calibrated model for the fd treatment was used to simulate the field hydrology under the cd conditions without considering any seepage scenario cdn the model predicted substantially higher water table and subsurface drainage flux than observed for the cd treatment these predictions clearly indicated that seepage from the cd plots should be considered both vertical and lateral seepage were initially considered but vertical seepage was subsequently excluded because it influenced wtd and subsurface drainage predictions for both fd and cd treatments the vertical seepage flux that was necessary for acceptable wtd and subsurface drainage flux prediction for cd caused predicted wtd to be substantially lower and subsurface drainage to be substantially less than measured values for the fd treatment for this reason lateral seepage was identified as the main seepage mechanism that is driven by the interaction between the two adjacent treatments with different management cd vs fd controlled drainage plots were considered as the source of lateral seepage lateral seepage input parameters were then calibrated under cd condition hydraulic head of receiving water h r and distance to receiving water l r were determined as discussed in the previous section the horizontal hydraulic conductivity of the soil profile k l was calibrated by evaluating the goodness of fit between predicted and measured daily subsurface drainage flux and wtd then the same hydraulic conductivity value for lateral seepage was used under fd condition the model was calibrated with constant h r values as defined in the standard version of drainmod the simulation scenarios with constant h r for fd and cd were referred to as fdl conhr and cdl conhr respectively however a constant h r prevented the predicted wtd from dropping lower than the h r value which departed from the observed wtd in dry periods therefore drainmod code was modified to read in dynamic h r as previously described the simulation scenarios with dynamic h r for fd and cd were referred to as fdl dynhr and cdl dynhr respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 model simulations of the free drainage treatment first drainmod simulated the hydrology of the fd plots with and without seepage measured water table in fd plots was always deeper than the water table in the adjacent cd plots and the naturally drained portion of the field creating a hydraulic gradient for lateral seepage from the cd plots and from the undrained field to the fd plots the plastic curtain buried between fd plots and the adjacent naturally drained portion of the field was only buried to 1 5 m depth so groundwater could possibly seep underneath the curtain guard lines were installed between fd and cd plots to isolate the center experimental drain lines of both the fd and cd plots from seepage effects however seepage from cd plots and nearby naturally drained field area to the fd plots could still have occurred graphical representation of results fig 5 showed that daily predicted wtd matched measured wtd with varying levels of agreement for the fd treatment under the three scenarios fdn fdl conhr and fdl dynhr the hydrologic simulations of the fd treatment without considering seepage or with considering seepage and constant h r resulted in poor daily wtd predictions during the dry summer periods of 2011 and 2014 when the measured water table dropped much deeper than predicted simulation result of the fdl conhr scenario was even worse than fdn in dry months since the constant h r value prevented the model from dropping the water table beyond a specific depth based on the constant h r value the hydrologic simulation of the fd treatment with seepage and dynamic h r generally improved the goodness of fit between daily predicted and measured wtd particularly during the dry months fig 5 according to model evaluation criteria suggested by skaggs et al 2012 the mae for predicting daily wtd in the range of 6 5 19 2 cm table 2 indicates excellent to acceptable agreement for the three scenarios best agreement between daily predicted and observed wtd lowest mae and highest nse values was found under fdl dynhr scenario compared to the other two scenarios on average over the 4 yr simulation period the mae and nse for predicted water table under the fdl dynhr were 6 9 cm and 0 79 respectively table 2 the agreement between daily predicted and observed wtd under fdn was better than fdl conhr the agreement between predicted and measured daily subsurface drainage rates whether seepage was considered or not was also acceptable to excellent as indicated graphically fig 5 and statistically table 3 overall the mae nse and npe values were significantly improved under the fdl dynhr scenario consideration of lateral seepage with dynamic h r improved agreement between predicted and measured daily drainage volumes in all years on average over the 4 yr simulation period the fdl dynhr scenario had the smallest mae 0 52 mm and largest nse 0 76 for predicting daily subsurface drainage rates compared to the fdn mae 0 60 mm nse 0 70 and fdl conhr mae 0 65 mm nse 0 69 scenarios table 3 according to performance criteria suggested by skaggs et al 2012 drainmod well predicted cumulative drainage outflows for the free drainage treatment over the 4 yr simulation period fig 5 the timing and magnitude of most flow events were well simulated for the three scenarios especially for the fdl dynhr scenario as indicated by the npe values in table 3 drainmod over predicted yearly drainage flow volume in 2011 predicted drainage volumes were close to observed in 2012 and 2013 and under predicted yearly drainage flow volume in 2014 for fdn and fdl conhr scenarios fig 5 under fdl dynhr scenario drainmod under predicted the cumulative drainage in 2011 npe 15 8 however the predicted drainage volumes were very close to observation during 2012 2014 npe range 3 6 to 1 6 therefore the consideration of seepage under fdl dynhr improved the agreement between predicted and measured cumulative drainage flow over the four periods of observation the simulation of two pump failure events simulation mode was changed to controlled drainage to simulate pump failure in late march and late august 2011 caused the major disagreement of predicted and observed wtd and drainage volume for all three scenarios the fdl dynhr scenario minimized the disagreement between predicted and observed cumulative drainage flow during these two pump failure events another case of fdl dynhr scenario increasing the agreement between predicted and measured drainage volume occurred during late january to early february 2014 when heavy snow occurred fig 5 3 2 model simulations of the controlled drainage treatment under cd subsurface drainage could only occur when the water table was closer to the surface than control level imposed in the study 36 cm below ground surface most of the time this resulted in only a few flow events in each year for example there were only two flow events of measurable magnitude in 2011 fig 6 such infrequent flow could be characterized as single flow events the calibrated model for the fdn scenario was used to simulate the hydrology of cd treatment without lateral seepage cdn scenario a cursory review of the results clearly shows the importance of considering seepage in quantifying the hydrology of this site under cd fig 6 for example the average predicted wtd for the 4 year study period under cdn scenario was 51 9 cm when seepage was not considered versus 80 4 cm observed table 4 the total predicted drainage for the four years was 123 7 cm under cdn scenario versus only 11 5 cm observed that is ignoring lateral seepage would have resulted in overprediction of drainage outflows by about a factor of 10 fig 6 the other statistics summarized in tables 4 and 5 and results plotted in fig 6 indicate very poor agreement between daily observed and predicted wtd and drainage flow when seepage was not considered when lateral seepage was considered especially under the cdl dynhr scenario the agreement between predicted and observed results was much improved prediction of daily wtd was in acceptable to excellent agreement with measured values as quantified by mae nse and pbias over the four year observation period under the cdl conhr and cdl dynhr table 4 annual cd drainage flow volume was over predicted by a minimum of 15 mm in 2011 and a maximum of 61 mm in 2012 when lateral seepage was considered table 5 while predicted drainage flows were about a factor of two greater than measured for the observation period the timing of most flow events was captured by drainmod and the total predicted drain flow was much closer to measured compared to model predictions without considering lateral seepage consideration of lateral seepage accounted for most of the difference in drainage volumes between the fd and cd treatments differences between daily predicted and observed wtd and daily flow volume were smallest in 2013 which was the only year that the drainage outlet was adjusted before wastewater irrigation the weir level was lowered 4 8 days to partially drain the soil profile prior to the two irrigation events in 2013 the weirs were raised back to their original elevations just prior to irrigation this action may have been at least partially responsible for producing the most annual drainage water of the four years of observation the weir depths were adjusted in the model inputs and drainmod successfully simulated the wtd and daily drainage flow volume during these periods as shown in fig 6 predicted wtd from jan to mar 2014 was deeper than observed for both fd and cd plots fig 6 a possible reason for these differences was an error in the measured precipitation which was primarily snowfall during the period jan 22 to feb 12 the rain gauges installed in the field were designed to measure rainfall and may not have recorded snowfall accurately there were four snowfall events from jan 22 to feb 12 2014 the snow depths were 3 8 8 9 3 3 and 1 3 cm on jan 22 jan 29 feb 11 and feb 12 respectively the average daily minimum air temperature from jan 20 to feb 23 was 1 5 c and it took 3 5 days for the minimum air temperature to rise above 0 c after each snowfall thus the snow melted slowly during this period the recorded precipitation at the experimental site was 6 4 cm 1 9 cm less than recorded precipitation at a weather station 2 2 km away from the experimental site 3 3 water balance components for free and controlled drainage treatments consideration of lateral seepage and dynamic h r fdl dynhr scenario improved the agreement between predicted and observed subsurface drainage flux for the fd treatment by only 1 2 cm yr 1 on average over the 4 yr simulation period table 6 the model predicted that the fd treatment received on average 0 9 cm yr 1 from the surrounding areas of the field including the cd plots and the naturally drained area fdl dynhr scenario consideration of lateral seepage did not influence predicted et and ro for the fd treatment the model predicted on average a less than 1 0 cm difference in et and almost no difference in ro for the fd treatment with and without lateral seepage table 6 the model predicted substantial runoff 17 9 cm from fd plots in 2011 there was no predicted runoff in years 2013 and 2014 and only 2 8 cm in 2012 lateral seepage did not influence the water balance for the experimental plots of the fd treatment this is evidenced by the small amount of lateral seepage predicted by the model for the fd treatment 2 7 cm yr 1 for dl conhr and 0 9 cm yr 1 for fdl dynhr and further supported by the overall satisfactory agreement between predicted and observed wtd and subsurface drainage for the fd treatment even without considering lateral seepage in the simulation this indicates that the outer guard drain lines of the fd treatment intercepted the majority of the lateral seepage flux from the cd treatment and the naturally drained field area thus the outer guard drains were effective in hydraulically isolating the inner experimental drains of the fd treatment it should be noted that the guard drain lines were not instrumented to measure the subsurface drainage outflow in order to estimate the lateral seepage intercepted by the guard drains in contrast to fd model predictions clearly showed the importance of considering seepage and dynamic h r scenario cdl dynhr for the water balance of the cd treatment table 4 drainmod predicted that considering lateral seepage substantially altered the water balance for the cd treatment it dramatically reduced the difference between average predicted and observed annual subsurface drainage flux from as high as 28 1 cm to only 2 7 cm it also reduced average annual predicted et from 80 6 to 77 1 cm and ro from 9 1 to 5 7 cm the reduction in predicted d et and ro was caused by the lateral seepage from cd plots to the surrounding area of the field predicted annual subsurface drainage flux from cd plots cdl dynhr scenario only represented 9 16 of that from fd plots fdl dynhr scenario predicted annual subsurface drainage for the fdl dynhr scenario ranged from 20 7 cm to 53 6 cm compared to a range of 2 1 8 1 cm for the cdl dynhr scenario table 6 enhanced annual et by cd was no more than 1 5 cm the year 2013 and the increase in annual ro was no more than 1 4 cm the year 2012 therefore lateral seepage accounted for approximately 96 of the reduction in subsurface drainage by cd lateral seepage from cd plots is an important pathway since nutrients could potentially be transported with seepage water theoretically lateral seepage could occur through all saturated soil profile in cd plots however the magnitude of the lateral seepage passing through each soil layer is greatly influenced by the hydraulic conductivity and relative position of that layer field investigations gilliam et al 1979 liu et al 2019 indicated the presence of a loamy sand layer at a depth of 135 210 cm with a hydraulic conductivity that is nearly 10 times higher than the soil layers just above and below it liu et al 2019 estimated that 74 7 of total lateral seepage from cd plots to adjacent field area occurred through this loamy sand layer nitrate n was the major form of nitrogen in shallow groundwater at the experimental site liu et al 2019 nitrate concentration was reduced from shallow to deep soil layers with a more pronounced reduction for cd plots mainly because of enhanced denitrification in the field liu et al 2019 so even though lateral seepage from cd plots to other portions of the field may have occurred it is hypothesized that the seeping water only transported relatively small amounts of nitrate from cd plots to other portions of the filed through the sand layer 135 210 cm however this conclusion may not be generalized to other field conditions where lateral seepage flux has relatively high no3 n concentration in contrast to fd model predictions indicated that the outer guard drains surrounding the inner experimental drains of the cd treatment were not effective in hydraulically isolating the treatment and reducing lateral seepage from the cd plots to the adjacent field area the significance of lateral seepage from the cd field plots primarily depends on three factors the transmissivity of the soil profile the management protocol of the drainage control structure and the size of the cd field plots the presence of the loamy sand layer with higher hydraulic conductivity the shallow management depth of the drainage control structure and small size of the cd field plots all contributed to high lateral seepage flux from the cd treatment to the adjacent field area the drain line at the edge of fd plots guard fd1 fig 1 was the nearest sink not the only sink for seepage water from cd plots as previously stated the subsurface drainage flux and drainage water quality for the guard lines were never monitored during the 4 yr experiment if the guard line of fd plots was one of the sinks for lateral seepage from cd plots subsurface drainage flow from this guard line would be continuously greater than the drainage flow from center lines of fd plots and the nitrate n concentration in drainage water leaving via the guard line of fd plots might also be lower than center lines of fd plot dilution effect monitoring guard lines of fd plots would be useful to evaluate the effect of lateral seepage on nutrient transport from managed cd to non managed fd portions of the drained field 3 4 implications this modeling study demonstrated the power of process based simulation models such as drainmod for interpreting and explaining data of experimental studies well coordinated experimental and modeling research can advance our understanding of mechanisms and processes influencing the behavior of the system being investigated the experimental study by liu et al 2019 showed that cd substantially reduced subsurface drainage flow but did not determine the fate of the water that did not drain out from the field plots because of implementing cd understanding the fate of this water is fundamental in determining the fate of nitrogen as affected by drainage water management the performance of cd in reducing nitrogen loss from artificially drained agricultural fields is strongly influenced by the presence of seepage and the nitrate concentration of the seeping water therefore the performance of cd reported in the literature determined merely by the reduction in nitrogen mass loading in drainage water is likely higher than the actual performance of the practice the difference between the apparent and actual performances of the practice depends on several factors including layering of the soil profile size and boundary conditions of the field area under cd and drain outlet management protocol all of these factors influence the amount of seepage and nitrate concentration in shallow groundwater and subsequently influence water and nitrogen balances in drained agricultural land in this modeling study drainmod predicted significant interaction between field plots in cd mode and other portions of the field including field plots in fd and the naturally drained area as a result the model predicted that over 90 of the water that did not drain out from the field via the drainage system due to cd seeped laterally from the cd plots to the surrounding field areas despite the significance of the lateral seepage pathway it was concluded that the difference between the apparent and actual performances of cd in reducing n export was not as big because seepage water had relatively low nitrate concentration as reported by liu et al 2019 however this conclusion cannot be generalized to other field conditions in experimental research different water table management treatments e g free drainage controlled drainage subirrigation are usually implemented on small size field plots despite attempts to hydraulically isolate adjacent experimental plots interaction among plots with different treatments is inevitable modeling this interaction and its effect on the water and nutrient balances is difficult and requires availability of specific experimental data that are not frequently measured we intentionally provided a detailed description of our modeling approach as a guidance for drainmod model users when modeling lateral seepage as affected by interaction between experimental plots under free and controlled drainage this modeling framework was possible because of the adequate field measurements including subsurface drainage outflow and water table depth for both fd and cd treatments liu et al 2019 lastly this modeling study clearly shows the importance of using proper model calibration strategies skaggs et al 2012 daggupati et al 2015 model users seeking to model the long term impacts of cd on water and nitrogen balances in artificially drained agricultural land should be careful not to conduct model simulations without proper model calibration this modeling study shows that an acceptable to excellent performance of the model for simulating one management scenario e g free drainage does not necessarily mean that the model will have a comparable performance for a different scenario e g controlled drainage if model users are planning to simulate the hydrology and nitrogen dynamics under both free and controlled drainage using a calibrated model for both drainage management scenarios is highly recommended and less likely to make erroneous predictions compared to using a model that is only calibrated against data from only one scenario e g free drainage in this study one can argue that the first set of drainmod simulations of the hydrology of the fd field plots which did not consider the seepage effect at all have a good enough performance based on statistical and graphical evaluations had the model calibration stopped at this point it would have produced a calibrated model that did not adequately represent the different hydrologic processes which leads to serious errors in predicting the effect of cd on field hydrology and n dynamics in the field arnold et al 2015 discussed the importance of proper representation of different hydrologic processes for reliable modeling of system s hydrologic response to changes in land use and management practices 4 conclusions the water management model drainmod successfully simulated the hydrology of a subsurface drained field in eastern north carolina u s that had two side by side experimental field plots operated in free drainage fd and controlled drainage cd results of the simulations strongly suggested that lateral seepage was an important component of the water balance for the cd treatment the standard version of drainmod assumes the hydraulic head h r that drives the lateral seepage to be constant throughout the simulation simulation using the standard drainmod that considered lateral seepage with constant h r generally improved the agreement between predicted and observed wtd and daily subsurface drainage flux for cd plots however it increased the disagreement between predicted and observed wtd in dry months for both fd and cd simulation using a modified drainmod code that considered lateral seepage with dynamic h r achieved the best agreement between predicted and observed wtd and daily subsurface drainage fluxes for both fd and cd plots in contrast to cd simulation results showed acceptable to excellent agreement between predicted and observed wtd and daily drainage volume for fd plots both with and without considering seepage this indicates that the magnitude of lateral seepage received by the experimental drain lines of the fd treatment was small thus the outer guard drain lines were effective in hydraulically isolating the inner experimental drain lines of fd treatment fig 1 by intercepting lateral seepage from adjacent cd treatment and adjacent naturally drained field area on average over the 4 year simulation period measured annual subsurface drainage from cd plots was less than 7 of that observed in fd plots 2 9 cm for cd vs 42 6 cm for fd simulation results showed that 96 of the reduction in subsurface drainage flux by cd could be attributed to lateral seepage on average drainmod predicted yearly lateral seepage of 33 0 cm according to model predictions cd increased annual et by no more than 1 1 cm yr 1 runoff ro was also increased but by no more than 0 5 cm yr 1 during the 4 yr period of observation the main contributing factors for the substantial lateral seepage flux that occurred at the cd fd boundary were the presence of a sandy layer with high hydraulic conductivity at 135 210 cm depth the shallow management depth of the drainage control structure 36 cm deep all year round and the relatively small size of the experimental plots in contrast to fd treatment the outer guard drain lines of the cd treatment fig 1 were not effective in providing hydraulic isolation of the experimental cd drains and reducing the lateral seepage from cd to fd and other adjacent field areas this study underscores the importance of using process based models such as drainmod to investigate key processes and mechanisms influencing the hydrology and water balance for subsurface drained agricultural land the approach presented in this paper can be used as a modeling framework by drainmod model users to assess the significance of lateral seepage when conducting field and plot scale experimental studies investigating the hydrologic and water quality impacts of cd based on the presented approach and results of the simulations calibrating drainmod using data from only one management scenario e g fd may lead to erroneous model predictions under a different management scenario e g cd if the model were to be applied for simulating both fd and cd

10024,water energy and food wef are three basic elements that safeguard human life and socioeconomic development as the demand for water increases in food and energy production water scarcity is more prominent globally wef nexus plays an important role in evaluating and alleviating the contradiction between food and energy for water based on the water footprint of food and energy in china from 1997 to 2016 this paper used the structure conduct performance analysis paradigm to evaluate the water competition mechanism the newly constructed competition mechanism model includes type conduct and performance the results showed that the blue water footprint of energy increased from 3 25 gm³ in 1997 to 12 54 gm³ in 2016 the blue water footprint of food remained above 200 gm³ for many years and competition between food and energy production for water was intensifying the gray water footprint of energy was increasing yearly and food reached the maximum value of 181 01 gm³ in 2014 through model analysis the south to north water diversion has not effectively alleviated water scarcity and a few provinces were still classified in the water pressure dominated area the northern channel of west to east power transmission only transferred electric energy from water pressure dominated area causing the unsustainability coefficients of inner mongolia and yunnan to increase from 0 09 and 0 03 in 1997 to 0 23 and 0 05 in 2016 this paper provides effective policy insights for global challenges facing wef nexus from the source process and end of food and energy production graphical abstract ga1 keywords wef nexus water security water footprint competition sustainability 1 introduction water energy and food wef are the three main elements that guarantee human life with climate change economic development and population growth zhang et al 2018a 2018b global demand for water energy and food continues to increase which has resulted in an increasing shortage of natural resources and potential social impact some countries have encountered wef security challenges especially in developing countries fernando 2016 the water security is a hotspot issue in wef security fedoroff et al 2010 and less than 3 of the estimated 1 4 billion km³ of water on global is available for use vincent and richard 2018 middle east faces water security and food security simultaneously antonelli and tamea 2015 further more serious regions such as north africa and west asia need to encounter water security energy security and food security king and jaafar 2015 there is a compact and complex relation among water energy and food and the insecurity of any element in the nexus will have an adverse effect on the nexus security allan et al 2015 to this end the bourne conference listed them as wef nexus in 2011 and it has quickly become a research hotspot in many disciplines such as global physical geography and resources environment in 2013 the united nations economic and social council for asia and the pacific released the wef nexus report in the asia pacific region promoting synergies and trade offs among the three and reducing water use unescap 2013 in 2014 fao published the water energy food report which interpreted the nexus from the perspective of ensuring food security fao 2014 in 2016 the european commission joint research center proposed that water footprint is an effective tool to evaluate the wef interaction system from the perspective of water resources in the same year henry et al 2016 developed the wef security evaluation index in order to ensure the basic living needs of human beings wef nexus research content mainly includes two aspects the internal relations among the three elements of water energy food system and the interaction between this system and external environment in the qualitative research on the internal relations scholars have proposed the evaluation system and research framework of wef nexus and explored its related concepts and methods zhang et al 2018 major development obstacles terrapon pfaff et al 2018 and research significance simpson and jewitt 2019 in the quantitative analysis of the internal relations the assessment of wef nexus can be divided into three stages clarifying principle establishing algorithm and building model lawford et al 2013 karan and asadi 2018 radmehr et al 2021 in the qualitative research on interaction the interaction mechanism between wef nexus and environment weitz et al 2017 and the feedback effect between economicsociety and wef nexus jalilov et al 2018 are research focus areas in quantitative research scholars used indicator and model to evaluate the complex causal relation between wef nexus and economy society and environment zeng et al 2019 yue and guo 2021 wef nexus is a multifactorial framework and contains a variety of relations under the background of global climate change water energy and food have formed a kind of mutual influence and restriction and highly sensitive and vulnerable security nexus the synergies and trade offs of the three would not only alleviate the resource crisis but also identify and eliminate contradictory policies the food and energy production process requires the investment of water resources and the water security leads to a synergy and competition between food and energy which in turn causes food security and energy security the water is the most sensitivity element of water energy food system besides the water resources also are the most prominent security issue in wef nexus scholars discussed the problems and challenges of water shortage from the aspects of production mode diet structure and economic development jalilov et al 2016 and predicted where safety problems may occur in the development path under the wef nexus it is necessary to improve production technology optimize and adjust the industrial structure and follow the concept of green development so as to achieve the goal of alleviating the pressure of regional water resources and ensuring food and energy security niva et al 2020 liu et al 2020 in addition based on the wef nexus perspective water footprint theory life cycle assessment method and system dynamic theory are introduced to evaluate the water use characteristic and temporal and spatial pattern in food and energy production salmoral and yan 2018 das et al 2021 by summarizing the current research achievements there are more qualitative research papers but the interaction mechanism in wef nexus is rarely evaluated quantitatively hence this study evaluates the competition mechanism between food and energy production for water according to the deficiencies of current research two innovative points of this work are proposed on the one hand we use water footprint as a calculation tool the water footprint can more accurately describe the water use in the production process and explore the pollution degree and sustainability of water through the perspective of water quality and water volume on the other hand this study evaluates the competition mechanism with reference to the theory of competitive advantage in economics it analyzes the dominant factor driving mechanism and feedback effect of competition mechanism comprehensively the objective of this study is to analyze the competition mechanism between food and energy production for water and selects china as the research object based on the water footprint of food and energy from 1997 to 2016 we build a new model to evaluate the competition mechanism from three aspects type conduct and performance this will provide a basis and corresponding measures for the region to alleviate resource shortages and accelerate high quality development 2 materials 2 1 general situation of the research areas the research region consists of 31 provinces in china fig 1 taiwan hong kong and macao are excluded because of data deficiency for grain production the 31 provinces are divided into 13 main food production areas 11 food balance areas and 7 main food sale areas meanwhile china has 14 large coal bases the production scale of coal base accounts for a large proportion of the total national production and increases yearly for example the coal bases output accounted for more than 60 of the national in 2015 in china the increase of food production and the development of biomass energy have forced water resources pressure to intensify liu et al 2013 the water use of primary fossil energy production processes increases yearly yang et al 2007 zhan et al 2015 and the water pollution in the energy production is serious bao et al 2015 which makes energy production extremely dependent on water resources the spatial distribution pattern of water resources cultivated land resource and coal reserves is quite different which further exacerbates the water security and negative ecological environmental and social impacts liu et al 2013 hence the research region is divided into main food production area coal base main food production area coal base and other regions fig 1 2 2 data sources the data required for this study includes agricultural production statistics data energy production statistics data meteorological data and social statistics data of 31 provincial administrative regions in china agricultural statistics data is mainly related to food production cereals beans and potatoes they mainly include sowing area yield fertilizer use irrigation water and discharge of major pollutants the agricultural production statistics data is from china statistical yearbook chinese national bureau of statistics cnbs 1998 2017 besides irrigation water use per unit area is obtained from china water resources bulletin ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 1998 2017 energy production statistics data mainly includes raw coal production raw coal washing oil production natural gas production thermal power generation and raw coal used for thermal power generation they are mainly obtained from china energy statistics yearbook chinese national bureau of statistics cnbs 1998 2017 meteorological data is mainly precipitation which comes from the china meteorological data service center china meteorological data service center 1998 2017 social statistics data includes population which also comes from china statistical yearbook the water use quota refers to national standard of the people s republic of china norm of water intake 3 methods under the background of wef nexus water security is particularly prominent mainly reflected in the competition between food and energy for water this paper intends to apply the water footprint to clarify the characteristic and evolutionary trend of water use in food and energy production based on the theory of competitive advantage competition type competition conduct and competition performance can identify the water competition mechanism in the food and energy industries water energy and food are the core of internal relation in wef nexus li et al 2019 climate variation directly affects the production and consumption of water energy and food meanwhile social economic and environment also affect the acquisition deployment and utilization of wef nexus with the new characteristics of interdependence and deep entanglement among the three resources the traditional single resource management mode has been unable to effectively deal with the contradiction this mode also wastes multiple resources which is not conducive to regional sustainable development from the perspective of multi resources wef nexus would sort out the internal mechanism and ensure wef security fig 2 water use in the food and energy production is the most important indicator that needs to be characterized this paper uses water footprint to achieve a unified quantitative characterization of water consumption water use efficiency and environmental impact zhang and zhang 2013 using micro water balance analysis and production process characteristics the water footprint algorithm is defined combined with statistical data hydrometeorological data and other measured data we quantified water footprint from the water consumption in the whole production process of food cereals beans and potatoes and energy coal oil natural gas and thermal power generation the water footprint provides a broader perspective to explain the relation among consumers producers and water use it is a quantitative tool for water consumption the blue water footprint is the amount of surface and groundwater consumed to produce a product or service and the green water footprint is the amount of rainwater consumed during production and pollution the gray water footprint is the volume of fresh water required to absorb and assimilate a certain pollution load egan 2011 the water footprint can clarify the occupancy of different uses and types of water in terms of spatial and temporal which is convenient for in depth analysis of competition mechanism hoekstra and hung 2005 the theory of competitive advantage is applied to further analyse the competition type conduct and performance of energy and food production it provides a structure conduct performance analysis paradigm which can discuss the competition mechanism from the perspective of cause process and result according to the theory of competitive advantage the competition type can be divided into water pressure dominated area food dominated area energy dominated area and other water use dominated area the competition conduct is mainly classified according to the current large scale projects in china including south to north water diversion north grain south transportation and west to east power transmission the competition performance is dominated by competition type and adjusted through competition conduct and it mainly reflects the water efficiency and water pollution in food and energy production fig 3 3

performance the market performance refers to the final economic achievements of an industry in terms of product cost and profit through a certain conduct under a certain structure in the model the competition performance is undoubtedly affected by economic development and policy guidance and the most prominent of the two aspects are the economic benefit of food and energy production and wef nexus sustainability 3 2 2 1 economic benefit in the model the positive benefit of competition performance is evaluated by break even analysis the break even analysis is a traditional and effective analysis method to research the relations among cost revenue and profit of an enterprise the product with lower selling price indicates that there are many water use industries and highlights the

sustainability is and the closer the curve is to the coordinate axis 4 results and discussion 4 1 spatial pattern and evolution of water footprint the water use of food and energy production is relatively large and fluctuates significantly which is likely to cause fierce competition by calculating the water footprint values of 31 provinces the evolutionary trend and characteristic of water use in food and energy production was analyzed from spatial and temporal for the water footprint of food fig 4 the blue water footprint was lower than green water footprint annually and their variation tendency were consistent with the results of song and chen 2019 this is related to the scale of production ecological water use and domestic water use the highest value of blue water footprint was 310 74 gm³ in 1997 and it has gradually decreased in recent years the fluctuation of green water footprint was relatively large which is related to china s annual precipitation the highest value of green water footprint was 444 55 gm³ in 1998 and the lowest value was 344 70 gm³ in 2001 the variation tendency of gray water footprint of food was relatively stable with a downward trend in recent years the highest gray water footprint was 181 01 gm³ in 2014 and the lowest was 157 17 gm³ in 2000 for the water footprint of energy the blue water footprint in 2015 reached a maximum of 18 85 gm³ and had a minimum of 31 62 gm³ in 1999 which showing an increasing trend zhao et al 2019 calculated the global gray water footprint from the perspective of production and consumption and it also manifested that the gray water footprint of energy was generally larger which has been decreasing yearly based on the multi year average water footprint of food from 1997 to 2016 fig 5 the high value areas of blue water and green water footprints were mainly distributed in the main food production area thereinto jiangsu heilongjiang and guangxi had the largest blue water footprint with values of 21 12 gm³ 20 98 gm³ and 19 28 gm³ respectively heilongjiang henan and anhui were the high value areas of green water footprint with values of 36 61 gm³ 31 26 gm³ and 29 70 gm³ respectively the spatial pattern of gray water footprint is almost the same as that of blue water and green water footprints henan jiangsu and shandong had the largest gray water footprint with values of 18 88 gm³ 12 57 gm³ and 12 41 gm³ respectively the spatial pattern of water footprint of energy in 31 provinces is displayed in fig 6 the high value areas of blue water footprint were mainly distributed in the south which had abundant water resources and rapid development of thermal power generation thereinto hubei guangdong and szechwan had the largest values at 1 53 gm³ 0 56 gm³ and 0 53 gm³ respectively the high value areas of gray water footprint are also related to the coal storage and they are generally consistent with the spatial pattern of blue water footprint jiangsu guangxi and henan had the largest gray water footprint with values of 28 47 gm³ 12 19 gm³ and 11 87 gm³ respectively by analyzing the spatial and temporal variation of water footprint it is found that china s blue water footprint is constantly rising and the increase rate of energy is significantly higher than that of food with the rapid development of china s secondary industry wef security becomes more prominent just as industrial water in developed countries such as the united states has become the main water use industry the ecological water use also faces greater pressure the larger gray water footprint indicates that water resources have greater potential to improve the water quantity of recycling the spatial distribution pattern of water footprint is quite different so competition type and performance in each province also have obvious differences and gaps 4 2 three modules of the competition mechanism model this model combines micro water balance analysis method and macro statistical method to identify the water use mechanism of food production the characteristic of water use in energy chain and the competition mechanism between energy and food for water in various provinces in the model competition type competition conduct and competition performance have two way causality and the transformation of competition type determines development trend of competition performance competition conduct is proposed to solve wef security and serve competition type and competition performance it is a strategic conduct that is constantly adjusted to achieve goals hence this study focused the influence of competition conduct on output region referring to the competition in the production process of the product and input region referring to the impact of the product transfer on the production product 4 2 1 competition type in the spatial pattern of competition type there were discrepancies in four regions fig 7 the main food production area is mainly located in the northeast region and the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river the three northeast provinces were dominated by water pressure dominated area the northeastern region has fertile land and a large number of economic crops such as rice and corn are planted which has forced the water resources pressure to increase in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river the main crops are rice wheat and corn the water footprint of rice is relatively large which is 1 32 km³ t 1 the abundant water resources in the region settle the demand of food production consequently jiangxi hubei and hunan were mainly dominated by food dominated area and other water use dominated area the coal base is mainly located in the northwest region the northwest region has less available water resources but there is a large reserve of primary fossil energy for example in 2015 the coal production capacities of xinjiang and jinbei reached 0 40 gt and 0 30 gt these provinces were mainly dominated by water pressure dominated area guizhou and yunnan are located in the southwestern region and their energy production scale was relatively smaller compared to the former but their food production was larger the relatively abundant water resources make them dominated by food dominated area and other water use dominated area in main food production area coal base food and energy production are main water consuming industries inner mongolia is the main coal base and will be among the five largest integrated energy bases the shortage of water resources led it to be dominated by water pressure dominated area hebei henan and anhui are the main food production areas which have many large irrigation areas and the increase of coal production forced water resources pressure to intensify nevertheless anhui was dominated by other water use dominated area because the chencun reservoir and xianghongdian reservoir in anhui provided the daily water demand for food and energy in other regions there are four competition types zhejiang chongqing fujian and guangdong were dominated by other water use dominated area most of the water resources uses in these provinces are concentrated in other water use industries such as service industry and ecological water use beijing shanghai and tianjin are mainly populated regions and the water resources pressure has been increasing so they are mainly dominated by water pressure dominated area the competition type of qinghai hainan and guangxi was determined by the output of food and coal except tibet from 1997 to 2016 the competition type of four regions gradually shifted from water pressure dominated area to other competition types fig 8 firstly the competition type of hubei and szechwan in the main food production area have gradually shifted from water pressure dominated area to other water use dominated area in general most provinces in this region turned into other water use dominated area secondly gansu shanxi ningxia and xinjiang in the coal base have always been water pressure dominated area while the water resources pressure in shaanxi guizhou and yunnan was gradually decreasing thirdly except for the competition type in anhui which has shifted from water pressure dominated area to other water use dominated area the competition type in other provinces has remained unchanged fourthly the competition type in beijing tianjin and shanghai has not changed and the remaining provinces have turned into other water use dominated area and energy dominated area by discussing the spatial and temporal variation of competition type the coal base and main food production area were mainly dominated by water pressure dominated area and food dominated area the provinces in other regions were mainly dominated by other water use dominated area the transformation of competition type is mainly caused by competition conduct and the internal competition mechanism such as water price and water right also affect it judging from the overall variation tendency four regions have gradually changed to other water use dominated area 4 2 2 competition performance the competition performance includes positive benefit and negative benefit and is reflected in wef nexus s response to environment sustainable development and economy economic benefit here the social impact is not considered because the competition conduct is the social conduct feedback on wef nexus for the positive benefit of competition performance the high value areas of selling price were generally concentrated in shanghai tibet hainan zhejiang and xinjiang while the low value areas were in shanxi shaanxi qinghai heilongjiang guizhou and ningxia fig 9 thereinto the water resource pressure index in the high value areas was low which resulted the competition type was dominated by other water use dominated area and the selling price was higher in the low value areas they are mainly the food production area and coal base these regions were dominated by water pressure dominated area which in turn led to lower selling price from 1997 to 2016 the multi year average selling price in shanghai increased from 3 62 cny kg 1 in 1997 2001 to 12 65 cny kg 1 in 2011 2016 the multi year average selling price in shanxi increased from 0 12 cny kg 1 in 1997 2001 to 0 63 cny kg 1 in 2011 2016 the selling price of each province was rising steadily and most provinces in the five year period showed increased first and then decreased the sustainability of wef nexus in four regions is showed in fig 10 in main food production area the thermal power generation capacity and food production scale in jiangsu was large which caused the multi year average k value to reach 0 85 in 1997 2001 the reason for shandong s poor sustainability was mainly due to the small amount of total water use which has been maintained at around 40 gm³ for many years the regions with better sustainability were hunan and jiangxi in 2016 the values of k in hunan and jiangxi decreased to 0 06 and 0 03 respectively on the one hand these provinces have higher use water efficiency and reasonable industrial structure on the other hand they controlled water resource pollution well in coal base shanxi and gansu had relatively poor sustainability the multi year average k values of shanxi and gansu 1997 2016 were 0 75 and 0 36 respectively shanxi has abundant coal resources and large scale production has resulted in a large gray water footprint nevertheless gansu s total water use is relatively small resulting in poor sustainability the sustainability in other provinces was better and the value of k was mostly maintained at around 0 10 in main food production area coal base the sustainability of henan and hebei was poor the multi year average k values were 0 69 and 1 17 1997 2016 respectively anhui and inner mongolia had better sustainability the main reason is that these provinces rely on policy guidance to increase investment in science and technology especially in the primary and secondary industries this is the key to driving down the overall water intensity of anhui which in turn makes it more sustainable zhang and fang 2017 the gray water footprint in inner mongolia was large but its relatively large total water use made it sustainable in other regions the sustainability was generally better hainan guangxi guangdong fujian and shanghai had multi year average k values of less than 0 10 1997 2016 these provinces are located in the south and sufficient water resources ensure food and energy production in addition their economic development is fast and they pay more attention to environmental pollution however tianjin had poor sustainability and its multi year average k value reached 0 80 1997 2016 the main reasons are that the total water use is small and the investment in water saving is insufficient fang 2015 except tibet in terms of spatial pattern the sustainability of other regions was better and the main food production area coal base was poor fig 10 between 1997 and 2016 the sustainability of most provinces gradually improved the sustainability of jiangxi guizhou and xinjiang fluctuated little and was nearly stable nevertheless the sustainability of ningxia shaanxi yunnan gansu heilongjiang inner mongolia and henan was deteriorating yearly 4 2 3 competition conduct by summarizing the evolutionary trend and spatial pattern of competition type and performance we need to further explore the feedback effect of competition conduct to them in 2002 china approved the overall plan for the south to north water diversion project which includes three water transfer lines in the east middle and west this project has brought huge benefit in alleviating water shortage and supported the economic development of the northern region mei 2010 wu et al 2006 the first phase of the eastern route is to supply water to shandong jiangsu and anhui table 2 zhang and yao 2019 between 2013 and 2016 the competition type in anhui shifted from water pressure dominated area to other water use dominated area shandong and jiangsu were still dominated by food dominated area and the increase in food production has forced water conflict in various industries to become prominent consequently the eastern route has not effectively alleviated their water shortage in terms of competition performance the sustainability of these three provinces was improving and anhui s decline was the largest which reaching 1 35 in addition the selling price of these provinces was rising jiangsu had the largest increase which was from 3 68 cny kg 1 to 4 89 cny kg 1 the first phase of the center route is to supply water to beijing tianjin henan and hebei table 3 zhang and yao 2019 from 2014 onwards the four provinces would continue to be dominated by water pressure dominated area food and energy were produced under the serious water resources pressure and the ecological water pressure continued to expand which also has not effectively alleviated water scarcity for competition performance the selling price of hebei and henan was rising but beijing and tianjin were falling thereinto hebei had the largest increase from 2 49 cny kg 1 to 3 22 cny kg 1 in addition the sustainability of beijing tianjin and hebei was improving while henan s sustainability was deteriorating west to east power transmission is divided into three channels the northern channel is to deliver the electric energy from the upper and middle reaches of the yellow river and shanxi and inner mongolia s kengkou thermal power plants to the beijing tianjin tangshan area the central channel transports the hydropower from the three gorges and the main tributaries of the jinsha river to east region the southern channel develops the electric energy of guizhou and yunnan and transports it to guangdong in competition type the electric energy in the southern channel was exported from the water affluent regions which effectively relieved the water resources pressure of surrounding provinces nevertheless the northern channel delivered electric energy from shanxi and inner mongolia which were water pressure dominated area to beijing tianjin and shandong and the central channel delivered hydropower to provinces where water resources were not scarce such as anhui the northern and central channels need to be noted that they may affect the sustainable development of water resources and even cause ecological pollution in competition performance the increase for selling price in the output region was smaller than input region the sustainability of output region was deteriorating for example the values of k in inner mongolia and yunnan increased from 0 09 and 0 03 in 1997 to 0 23 and 0 05 in 2016 north to south grain transportation is to transport grain from the main production area to the main sale area nevertheless the water scarce north exports large amounts of food to the water rich south and the virtual water transfer embedded in the traded commodities is equivalent to 5 20 gm3 annually liu and savenije 2008 ma et al 2006 the food production in the water scarce north further strengthens the shortage of water resources with the improvement of production technology and policy competition type and performance have ameliorated for competition type the main sale area and the main production area was shifting to other water use dominated area in the competition performance the sustainability of the main production area and the main sale area was improving the growth rates of selling price in the main production area and the main sale area were similar and only inner mongolia and tianjin s selling prices were falling by analyzing the south to north water diversion the west to east power transmission and the north to south grain transportation this study discovered that they have not effectively alleviated water scarcity on a global scale egypt s west to east water transfer australia s snowy mountain water transfer and russia s moscow canal project are all large scale projects built to solve water security but whether these projects force each industry to intensify competition for water requires further research the wef nexus approach has gained popularity in academia and decision makers leck et al 2015 benson et al 2015 but the most important policies in the fields of water energy and food are independent the target at this stage is to achieve policy consistency by identifying synergies and trade offs optimizing policy choices and adapting governance arrangements weitz et al 2017 consequently countries with prominent wef security can take the following measures to relieve competition for water in food and energy industries first based on the blue water footprint value it is found that the competition between food and energy production for water was becoming more intense and recommendations need to be formulated from the supply and demand sides on the supply side it is necessary to implement water saving technology in the source process and end the conversion of water right coordinates the water allocation for primary and secondary industries on the demand side water use efficiency can be managed by formulating water price and raising human awareness of water conservation damerau et al 2016 second according to the difference of water footprint spatial pattern the production base needs to be appropriately transferred food production bases should have abundant water resources reasonable land use sadeghi et al 2020 and fertile land m kopittke p et al 2019 lu et al 2015 under the background of considering the environmental carrying capacity china would consider coal transportation from northwest region to southwest region and energy base should be built in southwest region where the resources and environment permit third through the analysis of competition performance energy water use has higher economic value which would aggravate the contradiction between food and energy for water new energy will be developed into a substitute for primary fossil energy 5 conclusions under the background of global population growth climate change and resource shortage the shortage and conflict of water energy and food are impacting the world economic pattern political order and environmental health jiménez cisneros 2014 china s food and energy industries are extremely dependent on water resources causing extremely prominent water security coordinating the allocation of water resources in food energy and other industries has become a new challenge referring to the water footprint value we found that the competition between food and energy production for water in china was intensifying and blue water resources were the main driving factor in the food and energy production the increase of gray water footprint value indicates that it has negative feedback on water environment and ecological water use this competition mechanism model analyzed competition type and performance from a one dimensional perspective the competition type has generally shifted to other water use dominated area and the sustainability of most provinces has gradually improved from a two dimensional perspective the selling price of other water use dominated area was higher and in water pressure dominated area it was lower in the three dimensional perspective competition conduct found that water scarcity has not been effectively alleviated analyzing the example of china can provide a series of countermeasures for other countries facing wef security there are great uncertainties in the security and sustainability of wef nexus it is difficult to conduct research on nexus to obtain theoretical methods with high application value by researching specific local and trade off and preference cases söderbaum and granit 2014 stein et al 2014 it is of great significance and broad application prospects for establishing a set of mature wef nexus evaluation model improving the coordinated security guarantee ability of wef nexus and accelerating the level of economic and social

10024,water energy and food wef are three basic elements that safeguard human life and socioeconomic development as the demand for water increases in food and energy production water scarcity is more prominent globally wef nexus plays an important role in evaluating and alleviating the contradiction between food and energy for water based on the water footprint of food and energy in china from 1997 to 2016 this paper used the structure conduct performance analysis paradigm to evaluate the water competition mechanism the newly constructed competition mechanism model includes type conduct and performance the results showed that the blue water footprint of energy increased from 3 25 gm³ in 1997 to 12 54 gm³ in 2016 the blue water footprint of food remained above 200 gm³ for many years and competition between food and energy production for water was intensifying the gray water footprint of energy was increasing yearly and food reached the maximum value of 181 01 gm³ in 2014 through model analysis the south to north water diversion has not effectively alleviated water scarcity and a few provinces were still classified in the water pressure dominated area the northern channel of west to east power transmission only transferred electric energy from water pressure dominated area causing the unsustainability coefficients of inner mongolia and yunnan to increase from 0 09 and 0 03 in 1997 to 0 23 and 0 05 in 2016 this paper provides effective policy insights for global challenges facing wef nexus from the source process and end of food and energy production graphical abstract ga1 keywords wef nexus water security water footprint competition sustainability 1 introduction water energy and food wef are the three main elements that guarantee human life with climate change economic development and population growth zhang et al 2018a 2018b global demand for water energy and food continues to increase which has resulted in an increasing shortage of natural resources and potential social impact some countries have encountered wef security challenges especially in developing countries fernando 2016 the water security is a hotspot issue in wef security fedoroff et al 2010 and less than 3 of the estimated 1 4 billion km³ of water on global is available for use vincent and richard 2018 middle east faces water security and food security simultaneously antonelli and tamea 2015 further more serious regions such as north africa and west asia need to encounter water security energy security and food security king and jaafar 2015 there is a compact and complex relation among water energy and food and the insecurity of any element in the nexus will have an adverse effect on the nexus security allan et al 2015 to this end the bourne conference listed them as wef nexus in 2011 and it has quickly become a research hotspot in many disciplines such as global physical geography and resources environment in 2013 the united nations economic and social council for asia and the pacific released the wef nexus report in the asia pacific region promoting synergies and trade offs among the three and reducing water use unescap 2013 in 2014 fao published the water energy food report which interpreted the nexus from the perspective of ensuring food security fao 2014 in 2016 the european commission joint research center proposed that water footprint is an effective tool to evaluate the wef interaction system from the perspective of water resources in the same year henry et al 2016 developed the wef security evaluation index in order to ensure the basic living needs of human beings wef nexus research content mainly includes two aspects the internal relations among the three elements of water energy food system and the interaction between this system and external environment in the qualitative research on the internal relations scholars have proposed the evaluation system and research framework of wef nexus and explored its related concepts and methods zhang et al 2018 major development obstacles terrapon pfaff et al 2018 and research significance simpson and jewitt 2019 in the quantitative analysis of the internal relations the assessment of wef nexus can be divided into three stages clarifying principle establishing algorithm and building model lawford et al 2013 karan and asadi 2018 radmehr et al 2021 in the qualitative research on interaction the interaction mechanism between wef nexus and environment weitz et al 2017 and the feedback effect between economicsociety and wef nexus jalilov et al 2018 are research focus areas in quantitative research scholars used indicator and model to evaluate the complex causal relation between wef nexus and economy society and environment zeng et al 2019 yue and guo 2021 wef nexus is a multifactorial framework and contains a variety of relations under the background of global climate change water energy and food have formed a kind of mutual influence and restriction and highly sensitive and vulnerable security nexus the synergies and trade offs of the three would not only alleviate the resource crisis but also identify and eliminate contradictory policies the food and energy production process requires the investment of water resources and the water security leads to a synergy and competition between food and energy which in turn causes food security and energy security the water is the most sensitivity element of water energy food system besides the water resources also are the most prominent security issue in wef nexus scholars discussed the problems and challenges of water shortage from the aspects of production mode diet structure and economic development jalilov et al 2016 and predicted where safety problems may occur in the development path under the wef nexus it is necessary to improve production technology optimize and adjust the industrial structure and follow the concept of green development so as to achieve the goal of alleviating the pressure of regional water resources and ensuring food and energy security niva et al 2020 liu et al 2020 in addition based on the wef nexus perspective water footprint theory life cycle assessment method and system dynamic theory are introduced to evaluate the water use characteristic and temporal and spatial pattern in food and energy production salmoral and yan 2018 das et al 2021 by summarizing the current research achievements there are more qualitative research papers but the interaction mechanism in wef nexus is rarely evaluated quantitatively hence this study evaluates the competition mechanism between food and energy production for water according to the deficiencies of current research two innovative points of this work are proposed on the one hand we use water footprint as a calculation tool the water footprint can more accurately describe the water use in the production process and explore the pollution degree and sustainability of water through the perspective of water quality and water volume on the other hand this study evaluates the competition mechanism with reference to the theory of competitive advantage in economics it analyzes the dominant factor driving mechanism and feedback effect of competition mechanism comprehensively the objective of this study is to analyze the competition mechanism between food and energy production for water and selects china as the research object based on the water footprint of food and energy from 1997 to 2016 we build a new model to evaluate the competition mechanism from three aspects type conduct and performance this will provide a basis and corresponding measures for the region to alleviate resource shortages and accelerate high quality development 2 materials 2 1 general situation of the research areas the research region consists of 31 provinces in china fig 1 taiwan hong kong and macao are excluded because of data deficiency for grain production the 31 provinces are divided into 13 main food production areas 11 food balance areas and 7 main food sale areas meanwhile china has 14 large coal bases the production scale of coal base accounts for a large proportion of the total national production and increases yearly for example the coal bases output accounted for more than 60 of the national in 2015 in china the increase of food production and the development of biomass energy have forced water resources pressure to intensify liu et al 2013 the water use of primary fossil energy production processes increases yearly yang et al 2007 zhan et al 2015 and the water pollution in the energy production is serious bao et al 2015 which makes energy production extremely dependent on water resources the spatial distribution pattern of water resources cultivated land resource and coal reserves is quite different which further exacerbates the water security and negative ecological environmental and social impacts liu et al 2013 hence the research region is divided into main food production area coal base main food production area coal base and other regions fig 1 2 2 data sources the data required for this study includes agricultural production statistics data energy production statistics data meteorological data and social statistics data of 31 provincial administrative regions in china agricultural statistics data is mainly related to food production cereals beans and potatoes they mainly include sowing area yield fertilizer use irrigation water and discharge of major pollutants the agricultural production statistics data is from china statistical yearbook chinese national bureau of statistics cnbs 1998 2017 besides irrigation water use per unit area is obtained from china water resources bulletin ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 1998 2017 energy production statistics data mainly includes raw coal production raw coal washing oil production natural gas production thermal power generation and raw coal used for thermal power generation they are mainly obtained from china energy statistics yearbook chinese national bureau of statistics cnbs 1998 2017 meteorological data is mainly precipitation which comes from the china meteorological data service center china meteorological data service center 1998 2017 social statistics data includes population which also comes from china statistical yearbook the water use quota refers to national standard of the people s republic of china norm of water intake 3 methods under the background of wef nexus water security is particularly prominent mainly reflected in the competition between food and energy for water this paper intends to apply the water footprint to clarify the characteristic and evolutionary trend of water use in food and energy production based on the theory of competitive advantage competition type competition conduct and competition performance can identify the water competition mechanism in the food and energy industries water energy and food are the core of internal relation in wef nexus li et al 2019 climate variation directly affects the production and consumption of water energy and food meanwhile social economic and environment also affect the acquisition deployment and utilization of wef nexus with the new characteristics of interdependence and deep entanglement among the three resources the traditional single resource management mode has been unable to effectively deal with the contradiction this mode also wastes multiple resources which is not conducive to regional sustainable development from the perspective of multi resources wef nexus would sort out the internal mechanism and ensure wef security fig 2 water use in the food and energy production is the most important indicator that needs to be characterized this paper uses water footprint to achieve a unified quantitative characterization of water consumption water use efficiency and environmental impact zhang and zhang 2013 using micro water balance analysis and production process characteristics the water footprint algorithm is defined combined with statistical data hydrometeorological data and other measured data we quantified water footprint from the water consumption in the whole production process of food cereals beans and potatoes and energy coal oil natural gas and thermal power generation the water footprint provides a broader perspective to explain the relation among consumers producers and water use it is a quantitative tool for water consumption the blue water footprint is the amount of surface and groundwater consumed to produce a product or service and the green water footprint is the amount of rainwater consumed during production and pollution the gray water footprint is the volume of fresh water required to absorb and assimilate a certain pollution load egan 2011 the water footprint can clarify the occupancy of different uses and types of water in terms of spatial and temporal which is convenient for in depth analysis of competition mechanism hoekstra and hung 2005 the theory of competitive advantage is applied to further analyse the competition type conduct and performance of energy and food production it provides a structure conduct performance analysis paradigm which can discuss the competition mechanism from the perspective of cause process and result according to the theory of competitive advantage the competition type can be divided into water pressure dominated area food dominated area energy dominated area and other water use dominated area the competition conduct is mainly classified according to the current large scale projects in china including south to north water diversion north grain south transportation and west to east power transmission the competition performance is dominated by competition type and adjusted through competition conduct and it mainly reflects the water efficiency and water pollution in food and energy production fig 3 3 1 water footprint calculation 3 1 1 calculation of food production water footprint due to virtual water trade caused by international trade the water footprint research is distributed in agricultural

calculation formula is as follows 14 g w f i n d i max g w f i n d i 3 2 the competition mechanism model 3 2 1 competition type regarding the competition type in the model it is classified according to the shortage of water resources and industrial water allocation the water resources pressure index i w s jia et al 2002 can identify whether the relations between water resources in a certain region and regional population economy and environment are coordinated this study uses i w s wang et al 2015 and water resources pressure contribution rate wcr of food and energy hua et al 2020 15 i w

w s and i e f this model distinguished the dominant factor of competition mechanism in difference region the classification of specific competition type is shown in table 1 3 2 2 competition performance the market performance refers to the final economic achievements of an industry in terms of product cost and profit through a certain conduct under a certain structure in the model the competition performance is undoubtedly affected by economic development and policy guidance and the most prominent of the two aspects are the economic benefit of food and energy production and wef nexus sustainability 3 2 2 1 economic benefit in the model the positive benefit of competition performance is evaluated by break even analysis the break even analysis is a traditional and effective analysis method to research the relations among cost revenue and profit of an enterprise the product with lower selling price indicates that there are many water use industries and highlights the shortage of water resources the higher selling price is the opposite the calculation formula is as follows 18 p f c q v c where p is the selling price of the product cny kg 1 q is the estimated sales volume kg fc is the fixed cost of the product cny vc is the unit variable cost of the product cny kg 1 3 2 2 2 wef nexus sustainability through the ipat equation the negative benefit of competition performance is further analyzed in this model ehrlich and holdren 1971 found that the impact of population growth on the environment is not only closely related to the total population p but also to the wealth of society a and the technological level t yao et al 2017 by transforming this equation the gray water footprint of food and energy can reflect the wef nexus sustainability the specific formula is as follows 19 g p a t p w p w f g w where g is the environmental impact if only water resources are considered p is the population w is the water resources including the transit water use and the transfer of water across watersheds wfg is the gray water footprint w p represents the a w f g w represents the t the above formula can be transformed into 20 g p w f g w w p the values of k w f g w x w p and y g p in the inverse proportion function are all within 0 the constant k represents the pressure of the unit population on the environment the smaller k is the better the sustainability is and the closer the curve is to the coordinate axis 4 results and discussion 4 1 spatial pattern and evolution of water footprint the water use of food and energy production is relatively large and fluctuates significantly which is likely to cause fierce competition by calculating the water footprint values of 31 provinces the evolutionary trend and characteristic of water use in food and energy production was analyzed from spatial and temporal for the water footprint of food fig 4 the blue water footprint was lower than green water footprint annually and their variation tendency were consistent with the results of song and chen 2019 this is related to the scale of production ecological water use and domestic water use the highest value of blue water footprint was 310 74 gm³ in 1997 and it has gradually decreased in recent years the fluctuation of green water footprint was relatively large which is related to china s annual precipitation the highest value of green water footprint was 444 55 gm³ in 1998 and the lowest value was 344 70 gm³ in 2001 the variation tendency of gray water footprint of food was relatively stable with a downward trend in recent years the highest gray water footprint was 181 01 gm³ in 2014 and the lowest was 157 17 gm³ in 2000 for the water footprint of energy the blue water footprint in 2015 reached a maximum of 18 85 gm³ and had a minimum of 31 62 gm³ in 1999 which showing an increasing trend zhao et al 2019 calculated the global gray water footprint from the perspective of production and consumption and it also manifested that the gray water footprint of energy was generally larger which has been decreasing yearly based on the multi year average water footprint of food from 1997 to 2016 fig 5 the high value areas of blue water and green water footprints were mainly distributed in the main food production area thereinto jiangsu heilongjiang and guangxi had the largest blue water footprint with values of 21 12 gm³ 20 98 gm³ and 19 28 gm³ respectively heilongjiang henan and anhui were the high value areas of green water footprint with values of 36 61 gm³ 31 26 gm³ and 29 70 gm³ respectively the spatial pattern of gray water footprint is almost the same as that of blue water and green water footprints henan jiangsu and shandong had the largest gray water footprint with values of 18 88 gm³ 12 57 gm³ and 12 41 gm³ respectively the spatial pattern of water footprint of energy in 31 provinces is displayed in fig 6 the high value areas of blue water footprint were mainly distributed in the south which had abundant water resources and rapid development of thermal power generation thereinto hubei guangdong and szechwan had the largest values at 1 53 gm³ 0 56 gm³ and 0 53 gm³ respectively the high value areas of gray water footprint are also related to the coal storage and they are generally consistent with the spatial pattern of blue water footprint jiangsu guangxi and henan had the largest gray water footprint with values of 28 47 gm³ 12 19 gm³ and 11 87 gm³ respectively by analyzing the spatial and temporal variation of water footprint it is found that china s blue water footprint is constantly rising and the increase rate of energy is significantly higher than that of food with the rapid development of china s secondary industry wef security becomes more prominent just as industrial water in developed countries such as the united states has become the main water use industry the ecological water use also faces greater pressure the larger gray water footprint indicates that water resources have greater potential to improve the water quantity of recycling the spatial distribution pattern of water footprint is quite different so competition type and performance in each province also have obvious differences and gaps 4 2 three modules of the competition mechanism model this model combines micro water balance analysis method and macro statistical method to identify the water use mechanism of food production the characteristic of water use in energy chain and the competition mechanism between energy and food for water in various provinces in the model competition type competition conduct and competition performance have two way causality and the transformation of competition type determines development trend of competition performance competition conduct is proposed to solve wef security and serve competition type and competition performance it is a strategic conduct that is constantly adjusted to achieve goals hence this study focused the influence of competition conduct on output region referring to the competition in the production process of the product and input region referring to the impact of the product transfer on the production product 4 2 1 competition type in the spatial pattern of competition type there were discrepancies in four regions fig 7 the main food production area is mainly located in the northeast region and the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river the three northeast provinces were dominated by water pressure dominated area the northeastern region has fertile land and a large number of economic crops such as rice and corn are planted which has forced the water resources pressure to increase in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river the main crops are rice wheat and corn the water footprint of rice is relatively large which is 1 32 km³ t 1 the abundant water resources in the region settle the demand of food production consequently jiangxi hubei and hunan were mainly dominated by food dominated area and other water use dominated area the coal base is mainly located in the northwest region the northwest region has less available water resources but there is a large reserve of primary fossil energy for example in 2015 the coal production capacities of xinjiang and jinbei reached 0 40 gt and 0 30 gt these provinces were mainly dominated by water pressure dominated area guizhou and yunnan are located in the southwestern region and their energy production scale was relatively smaller compared to the former but their food production was larger the relatively abundant water resources make them dominated by food dominated area and other water use dominated area in main food production area coal base food and energy production are main water consuming industries inner mongolia is the main coal base and will be among the five largest integrated energy bases the shortage of water resources led it to be dominated by water pressure dominated area hebei henan and anhui are the main food production areas which have many large irrigation areas and the increase of coal production forced water resources pressure to intensify nevertheless anhui was dominated by other water use dominated area because the chencun reservoir and xianghongdian reservoir in anhui provided the daily water demand for food and energy in other regions there are four competition types zhejiang chongqing fujian and guangdong were dominated by other water use dominated area most of the water resources uses in these provinces are concentrated in other water use industries such as service industry and ecological water use beijing shanghai and tianjin are mainly populated regions and the water resources pressure has been increasing so they are mainly dominated by water pressure dominated area the competition type of qinghai hainan and guangxi was determined by the output of food and coal except tibet from 1997 to 2016 the competition type of four regions gradually shifted from water pressure dominated area to other competition types fig 8 firstly the competition type of hubei and szechwan in the main food production area have gradually shifted from water pressure dominated area to other water use dominated area in general most provinces in this region turned into other water use dominated area secondly gansu shanxi ningxia and xinjiang in the coal base have always been water pressure dominated area while the water resources pressure in shaanxi guizhou and yunnan was gradually decreasing thirdly except for the competition type in anhui which has shifted from water pressure dominated area to other water use dominated area the competition type in other provinces has remained unchanged fourthly the competition type in beijing tianjin and shanghai has not changed and the remaining provinces have turned into other water use dominated area and energy dominated area by discussing the spatial and temporal variation of competition type the coal base and main food production area were mainly dominated by water pressure dominated area and food dominated area the provinces in other regions were mainly dominated by other water use dominated area the transformation of competition type is mainly caused by competition conduct and the internal competition mechanism such as water price and water right also affect it judging from the overall variation tendency four regions have gradually changed to other water use dominated area 4 2 2 competition performance the competition performance includes positive benefit and negative benefit and is reflected in wef nexus s response to environment sustainable development and economy economic benefit here the social impact is not considered because the competition conduct is the social conduct feedback on wef nexus for the positive benefit of competition performance the high value areas of selling price were generally concentrated in shanghai tibet hainan zhejiang and xinjiang while the low value areas were in shanxi shaanxi qinghai heilongjiang guizhou and ningxia fig 9 thereinto the water resource pressure index in the high value areas was low which resulted the competition type was dominated by other water use dominated area and the selling price was higher in the low value areas they are mainly the food production area and coal base these regions were dominated by water pressure dominated area which in turn led to lower selling price from 1997 to 2016 the multi year average selling price in shanghai increased from 3 62 cny kg 1 in 1997 2001 to 12 65 cny kg 1 in 2011 2016 the multi year average selling price in shanxi increased from 0 12 cny kg 1 in 1997 2001 to 0 63 cny kg 1 in 2011 2016 the selling price of each province was rising steadily and most provinces in the five year period showed increased first and then decreased the sustainability of wef nexus in four regions is showed in fig 10 in main food production area the thermal power generation capacity and food production scale in jiangsu was large which caused the multi year average k value to reach 0 85 in 1997 2001 the reason for shandong s poor sustainability was mainly due to the small amount of total water use which has been maintained at around 40 gm³ for many years the regions with better sustainability were hunan and jiangxi in 2016 the values of k in hunan and jiangxi decreased to 0 06 and 0 03 respectively on the one hand these provinces have higher use water efficiency and reasonable industrial structure on the other hand they controlled water resource pollution well in coal base shanxi and gansu had relatively poor sustainability the multi year average k values of shanxi and gansu 1997 2016 were 0 75 and 0 36 respectively shanxi has abundant coal resources and large scale production has resulted in a large gray water footprint nevertheless gansu s total water use is relatively small resulting in poor sustainability the sustainability in other provinces was better and the value of k was mostly maintained at around 0 10 in main food production area coal base the sustainability of henan and hebei was poor the multi year average k values were 0 69 and 1 17 1997 2016 respectively anhui and inner mongolia had better sustainability the main reason is that these provinces rely on policy guidance to increase investment in science and technology especially in the primary and secondary industries this is the key to driving down the overall water intensity of anhui which in turn makes it more sustainable zhang and fang 2017 the gray water footprint in inner mongolia was large but its relatively large total water use made it sustainable in other regions the sustainability was generally better hainan guangxi guangdong fujian and shanghai had multi year average k values of less than 0 10 1997 2016 these provinces are located in the south and sufficient water resources ensure food and energy production in addition their economic development is fast and they pay more attention to environmental pollution however tianjin had poor sustainability and its multi year average k value reached 0 80 1997 2016 the main reasons are that the total water use is small and the investment in water saving is insufficient fang 2015 except tibet in terms of spatial pattern the sustainability of other regions was better and the main food production area coal base was poor fig 10 between 1997 and 2016 the sustainability of most provinces gradually improved the sustainability of jiangxi guizhou and xinjiang fluctuated little and was nearly stable nevertheless the sustainability of ningxia shaanxi yunnan gansu heilongjiang inner mongolia and henan was deteriorating yearly 4 2 3 competition conduct by summarizing the evolutionary trend and spatial pattern of competition type and performance we need to further explore the feedback effect of competition conduct to them in 2002 china approved the overall plan for the south to north water diversion project which includes three water transfer lines in the east middle and west this project has brought huge benefit in alleviating water shortage and supported the economic development of the northern region mei 2010 wu et al 2006 the first phase of the eastern route is to supply water to shandong jiangsu and anhui table 2 zhang and yao 2019 between 2013 and 2016 the competition type in anhui shifted from water pressure dominated area to other water use dominated area shandong and jiangsu were still dominated by food dominated area and the increase in food production has forced water conflict in various industries to become prominent consequently the eastern route has not effectively alleviated their water shortage in terms of competition performance the sustainability of these three provinces was improving and anhui s decline was the largest which reaching 1 35 in addition the selling price of these provinces was rising jiangsu had the largest increase which was from 3 68 cny kg 1 to 4 89 cny kg 1 the first phase of the center route is to supply water to beijing tianjin henan and hebei table 3 zhang and yao 2019 from 2014 onwards the four provinces would continue to be dominated by water pressure dominated area food and energy were produced under the serious water resources pressure and the ecological water pressure continued to expand which also has not effectively alleviated water scarcity for competition performance the selling price of hebei and henan was rising but beijing and tianjin were falling thereinto hebei had the largest increase from 2 49 cny kg 1 to 3 22 cny kg 1 in addition the sustainability of beijing tianjin and hebei was improving while henan s sustainability was deteriorating west to east power transmission is divided into three channels the northern channel is to deliver the electric energy from the upper and middle reaches of the yellow river and shanxi and inner mongolia s kengkou thermal power plants to the beijing tianjin tangshan area the central channel transports the hydropower from the three gorges and the main tributaries of the jinsha river to east region the southern channel develops the electric energy of guizhou and yunnan and transports it to guangdong in competition type the electric energy in the southern channel was exported from the water affluent regions which effectively relieved the water resources pressure of surrounding provinces nevertheless the northern channel delivered electric energy from shanxi and inner mongolia which were water pressure dominated area to beijing tianjin and shandong and the central channel delivered hydropower to provinces where water resources were not scarce such as anhui the northern and central channels need to be noted that they may affect the sustainable development of water resources and even cause ecological pollution in competition performance the increase for selling price in the output region was smaller than input region the sustainability of output region was deteriorating for example the values of k in inner mongolia and yunnan increased from 0 09 and 0 03 in 1997 to 0 23 and 0 05 in 2016 north to south grain transportation is to transport grain from the main production area to the main sale area nevertheless the water scarce north exports large amounts of food to the water rich south and the virtual water transfer embedded in the traded commodities is equivalent to 5 20 gm3 annually liu and savenije 2008 ma et al 2006 the food production in the water scarce north further strengthens the shortage of water resources with the improvement of production technology and policy competition type and performance have ameliorated for competition type the main sale area and the main production area was shifting to other water use dominated area in the competition performance the sustainability of the main production area and the main sale area was improving the growth rates of selling price in the main production area and the main sale area were similar and only inner mongolia and tianjin s selling prices were falling by analyzing the south to north water diversion the west to east power transmission and the north to south grain transportation this study discovered that they have not effectively alleviated water scarcity on a global scale egypt s west to east water transfer australia s snowy mountain water transfer and russia s moscow canal project are all large scale projects built to solve water security but whether these projects force each industry to intensify competition for water requires further research the wef nexus approach has gained popularity in academia and decision makers leck et al 2015 benson et al 2015 but the most important policies in the fields of water energy and food are independent the target at this stage is to achieve policy consistency by identifying synergies and trade offs optimizing policy choices and adapting governance arrangements weitz et al 2017 consequently countries with prominent wef security can take the following measures to relieve competition for water in food and energy industries first based on the blue water footprint value it is found that the competition between food and energy production for water was becoming more intense and recommendations need to be formulated from the supply and demand sides on the supply side it is necessary to implement water saving technology in the source process and end the conversion of water right coordinates the water allocation for primary and secondary industries on the demand side water use efficiency can be managed by formulating water price and raising human awareness of water conservation damerau et al 2016 second according to the difference of water footprint spatial pattern the production base needs to be appropriately transferred food production bases should have abundant water resources reasonable land use sadeghi et al 2020 and fertile land m kopittke p et al 2019 lu et al 2015 under the background of considering the environmental carrying capacity china would consider coal transportation from northwest region to southwest region and energy base should be built in southwest region where the resources and environment permit third through the analysis of competition performance energy water use has higher economic value which would aggravate the contradiction between food and energy for water new energy will be developed into a substitute for primary fossil energy 5 conclusions under the background of global population growth climate change and resource shortage the shortage and conflict of water energy and food are impacting the world economic pattern political order and environmental health jiménez cisneros 2014 china s food and energy industries are extremely dependent on water resources causing extremely prominent water security coordinating the allocation of water resources in food energy and other industries has become a new challenge referring to the water footprint value we found that the competition between food and energy production for water in china was intensifying and blue water resources were the main driving factor in the food and energy production the increase of gray water footprint value indicates that it has negative feedback on water environment and ecological water use this competition mechanism model analyzed competition type and performance from a one dimensional perspective the competition type has generally shifted to other water use dominated area and the sustainability of most provinces has gradually improved from a two dimensional perspective the selling price of other water use dominated area was higher and in water pressure dominated area it was lower in the three dimensional perspective competition conduct found that water scarcity has not been effectively alleviated analyzing the example of china can provide a series of countermeasures for other countries facing wef security there are great uncertainties in the security and sustainability of wef nexus it is difficult to conduct research on nexus to obtain theoretical methods with high application value by researching specific local and trade off and preference cases söderbaum and granit 2014 stein et al 2014 it is of great significance and broad application prospects for establishing a set of mature wef nexus evaluation model improving the coordinated security guarantee ability of wef nexus and accelerating the level of economic and social
