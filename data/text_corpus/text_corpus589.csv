2945,numerical reservoir simulation of co2 storage in geological formations is computationally expensive due to the complex and often coupled multiphase flow phenomena and the large spatial and temporal scales upscaling is a family of techniques used to decrease petrophysical degrees of freedom from a fine scale model to a coarser one such that the computational costs can be substantially reduced while maintaining key fine scale flow mechanisms at least approximately this research aims at developing methods suitable for upscaling co2 migration in 3d heterogeneous geological systems two percolation based methods are proposed to upscale the multiphase flow functions of the fine scale models with large and zero correlation lengths respectively to confirm the applicability of the proposed upscaling methods a case study is carried out the combination of the two methods is adopted to upscale a representative of eolian sandstones with mixed correlation lengths these are achieved thanks to the consideration of the dominant co2 migration direction in aquifers the computational errors between fine and coarse scale models in terms of averaged co2 saturation were less than 10 thereby demonstrating the robustness of the upscaling methods the advantages of the proposed method are also highlighted by comparing it with other commonly used upscaling approaches overall this research sheds light on the understanding of fine scale co2 migration in heterogeneous geological systems and illustrates the benefits of properly incorporating small scale capillary barriers effects into coarse grained scale models keywords upscaling post injection scenario capillary barriers co2 saturation multiphase flow modeling data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction reservoir numerical simulation enables the prediction of multiphase fluid migration and distribution in subsurface hydrology studies for simulations of oil water systems viscous forces dominate over capillary ones in regards to large scale observations in reservoirs as for co2 brine systems however capillary pressure effects are much more important largely due to the low flow rates fine scale variations in terms of capillary pressure namely capillary heterogeneity as well as permeability significantly impact co2 migration and distribution during and after the drainage process considerations of such fine scale variations are computationally expensive when modeling co2 migration in saline aquifers upscaling is defined as the coarse graining technology to translate petrophysical properties e g relative permeability and capillary pressure from a fine grid to a coarser one such that the computational costs can be substantially reduced while key aspects of the fine scale flow solution can be approximately maintained the accuracy of upscaling technologies varies with the type of fluid displacement process for example a method that is adequate for simulating single phase flow may not be suitable to model viscosity dominated multiphase flow processes on the other hand an approach appropriate for the latter may not be accurate enough when buoyancy driven displacement is considered therefore an applicable upscaling technique is required for co2 migration simulations to decrease the computational costs while simultaneously considering the aforementioned impacts various methods have been proposed to carry out large scale property averaging or coarse graining for two phase flow in heterogeneous porous media i e dynamic pseudo function method and steady state upscaling dynamic pseudo function method based on the fluid flow mass conservation at the boundaries of porous media fine scale simulations are run and the obtained pressure and saturation values at each fine grid block are utilized to determine the corresponding value at coarse scale model then the pseudo functions can be evaluated by darcy s law between adjacent coarse scale grid blocks csgbs kyte and berry 1975 bourgeat and jurak 2010 for example bolster et al 2009 and bolster et al 2011 obtained an effective large scale flow equation governing the saturation of the displacing fluid for the buckley leverett problem their models can quantify the influence of heterogeneity on the spatial and temporal variation of the saturation front thus enlarging the surface area between the fluids as well as the dissolution trapping capacity of co2 steady state upscaling in contrast to dynamic methods fine scale simulations are not required for steady state upscaling this approach mainly relies on having a dominant flow driving force namely either capillary force viscous force or gravity mantoglou and gelhar 1987 illustrated that large scale effective parameters for two phase flow systems rely on the stochastic parameters denoting local properties quintard and whitaker 1990 proposed a volume averaging alternative to determine the large scale capillary pressure and relative permeability curves later mouche et al 2010 adopted an upscaling method to simulate the vertical migration of co2 plume through periodic layered porous media by using homogenization more recently behzadi and alvarado 2012 provided an upscaled model for co2 vertical migration during the post injection stage with the assistance of percolation considerations even more recently cheng and rabinovich 2020 determined the upscaled co2 saturation distribution applying several commonly used methods which they used to propose an optimization based technique to characterize the co2 vertical migration however for the post co2 injection simulation at field scale one must realize that the co2 brine flow in saline aquifers cannot be completely dominated by just one force at all spatial and temporal scales therefore an intermediate method considering both effects of capillary force and buoyancy is required viscous force effects can be ignored due to the low flow rate of co2 stephen et al 2000 for co2 brine systems the key role of capillary heterogeneity on co2 trapping simulations has been confirmed and computing upscaled quantities under capillary dominant conditions is generally relied upon to deal with capillary heterogeneity issues saadatpoor et al 2010 in this area 2 d heterogeneous upscaling models are frequently used due to their low computational cost yet 2 d models fine and coarse scales are not truly representative of the underground formations and some spatial heterogeneity characteristics important to co2 flow are ignored so these models cannot adequately mimic co2 migration for instance see fig 1 a the bedding layers are evident in the 2 d geological model in which the interaction between fluid flow and bedding layers cannot be ignored nevertheless for 3 d models the real spatial distribution of these bedding layers may differ from that observed in 2 d models as shown in fig 1 b in other words fluids must directly interact with bedding layers during co2 migration from the 2 d perspective whereas for 3 d model the interaction between bedding layers and co2 brine may be different as a result it is reasonable to conduct upscaling based on a 3 d fine scale model at present many of the published multiphase flow upscaling approaches incorporate location independent relative permeability and only saturation dependent functions this approach leads to identical rock fluid functions regardless of rock type and other local characteristics of the rock the most relevant consequence of these approaches is that they fail to simulate the multiphase displacement process realistically and potentially serving as poor predictor to compensate for this error behzadi and alvarado 2012 proposed and tested an upscaling method for co2 vertical migration during the post injection stage in eolian systems based on percolation theory however the proposed method could be applied only on 2 d models which ignores critical effects of spatial heterogeneity on co2 migration in 3 d geological systems this can be interpreted as upscaling essentially in the vertical direction neglecting the impact of the lateral correlation length in the geological system uncorrelated random models to resolve these limitations we propose modified percolation based methods to upscale the co2 migration during a post injection period in 3 d heterogeneous geological models with varied correlation lengths such that the co2 migration behaviors can be captured reasonably several research works have studied the feasibility of co2 sequestration in deep saline aquifers keating et al 2016 dai et al 2018 and in hydrocarbon reservoirs dai et al 2014 pan et al 2016 jia et al 2018 four main trapping mechanisms are recognized in the context of co2 geological storage structural stratigraphic residual phase solubility and mineral trapping the trapping contribution for each of them is time dependent although they corporately control the co2 migration and distribution benson and cole 2008 however our previous study illustrated that capillary heterogeneity serves two main roles during co2 migration guiding the direction of co2 flow and offering the possibility of capillary trapping kou et al 2021 thus leading to the local evident co2 saturation contrast this mechanism differs from the aforementioned four mechanisms in terms of scale and magnitude behzadi and alvarado 2012 for instance the current study differentiated the contribution between capillary heterogeneity trapping and residual trapping from the land trapping model harris et al 2021 this study aims at developing the upscaled co2 migration models while maintaining the main capillary heterogeneity features of fine scale models it is worth mentioning that since field scale hydrodynamic simulation is complex and time consuming and dominant at earlier years during storage we focused our efforts on that portion and ignored geochemical contributions in this portion of our research though it will be the focus of future work given the dominance of non geochemical effects this study could be a critical reference for co2 storage in saline aquifers where co2 hydrodynamic trapping dominates over geochemical trapping this article is organized as follows i the structural and petrophysical setup of the fine scale geological models and the corresponding upscaling approaches are shown in the materials and methods section ii following that the comparison of average co2 saturation resulting from the simulations between the fine scale model and the corresponding upscaled model are performed to verify the reliability of the proposed upscaling methods in the results and discussion section iii a case study is subsequently provided to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed upscaling methods in the case study section iv then the conclusions obtained in this study are accordingly highlighted in the conclusions section 2 materials and methods 2 1 fine scale geological model in this section the base fine scale geological model is first generated in petrel a 3d geological modeling software petrel 2021 then the fine scale geological model is imported into the cmg gem a compositional unconventional simulator computer modeling group 2019 2 1 1 structural model the 3d geological model is vertically divided into three regions the source region at the bottom where co2 is initially located the main section or the fine scale geological model in the middle and the sink region at the top where co2 finally accumulates see fig 2 the dimensions of the source main section and sink all are 40 m x 10 m y 10 m z in which the grid block sizes are 0 4 m x 0 1 m y 10 m z 0 4 m x 0 1 m y 0 1 m z and 0 4 m x 0 1 m y 10 m z respectively the source and sink regions are homogeneous whereas the main section exhibits heterogeneous permeability and capillary pressure the no flow lateral boundary conditions are considered to ignore convective flow no flow boundary conditions are also expected at the top of sink and the bottom of source which both are contacted by impermeable seals the setup represents the post co2 injection scenario by assuming all co2 is initially located at the bottom source region this is because for a relatively thick saline aquifer co2 is generally injected into the bottom of saline aquifer to elongate the time required for co2 to touch caprock therefore most co2 accumulates at the bottom of saline aquifer during injection stage as the simulation starts co2 firstly flows into the main section from source region then migrates through the main section controlled by capillary force and buoyancy following that enters and accumulates in the sink region at the top 2 1 2 petrophysical model porosity and relative permeability are uniform throughout the entire fine scale geological model to reduce the computational cost to be more specific porosity is a constant 0 27 and relative permeability is generated by applying the brooks corey model in which residual water saturation and co2 end point relative permeability are 0 27 and 0 26 respectively the porosity and relative permeability setups are comparable to what we used in previous work which has proved the corresponding computational efficiency behzadi and alvarado 2012 for absolute permeability sequential gaussian simulation is used to generate a log normally distributed absolute permeability field the mean value and standard deviation of the permeability field are 20 md and 30 respectively ranging from 0 1 to 1000 md from the well log data and lab measurements the permeability distribution of target saline aquifers is expected to be quite complex as a result the representative properties values which cover most of the range were selected here despite that these properties are still representative of the real geological system to a significant degree it is worth noting that the color bar range of permeability in fig 2 is from 1 to 100 md which is to show the permeability contrast clearly in the fine scale geological model the absolute permeability anisotropy is ignored e g k x k y k z meanwhile two correlation lengths in the 3d fine scale geological model are considered 4 m 1 m 0 m and 0 m 0 m 0 m respectively as shown in fig 2 c and d specifically the correlation length setup of 4 m 1 m 0 m is to make a comparison with our previous study which considered a correlation length of 4 m 0 m in x z plane of the 2 d geological model behzadi and alvarado 2012 besides such a correlation length setup is also inspired by the petrophysical features of the eolian sandstone minnelusa sandstone formation in wyoming as for capillary pressure the leverett j function is applied to parameterize the location dependent permeability dependent in this study capillary pressure see eq 1 1 j s w p c σ c o s θ k ϕ where s w is the water saturation pc is the capillary pressure which is produced by the van genuchten model σ and θ are co2 water interfacial tension and contact angle respectively which are kept constant in this study k is the absolute permeability and ϕ is the porosity 2 2 upscaling methods saadatpoor et al 2010 and behzadi et al 2011 have computationally confirmed that even micro and meso scale petrophysical heterogeneity can dramatically influence co2 migration and distribution as a result it is necessary to develop an upscaling approach for preserving relevant fine scale effects for most cases multiphase flow upscaling mfu is directly utilized for example relative permeability and capillary pressure are upscaled through geometric averaging and volumetric averaging respectively behzadi and alvarado 2012 cheng and rabinovich 2020 however this technique is not physically sound since it fails to account for the connected extremes e g the permeability from one of the fine scale grid blocks fsgbs located in a csgb might be extremely either small or large dependent on the size of the correlation length this study proposes two different percolation based upscaling approaches to compensate for this error upscaling is conducted in a cube which includes eight adjacent fsgbs hence the upscaling ratio ur the number of fsgbs to the number of csgb equals 8 2 2 1 large correlation length the geological system with apparent correlation length can be commonly observed in eolian sandstones i e minnelusa formation in the powder river basin prb of wyoming wang et al 2022 the petrophysical properties are inter correlated within a distance of the order of the correlation length so the petrophysical property variation is not evident on the other hand the low value petrophysical properties bedding layers within correlation length horizontally guide the co2 migration representing that co2 migration along the horizontal direction is significant in the geological model with large correlation length gmlcl as a result the correlation length is included in the x y plane and the petrophysical properties of four adjacent fsgbs in the same x y plane can be firstly averaged hence the one csgb is consequently produced as fig 3 shows subsequently the following techniques are introduced to populate the fine scale capillary pressure and relative permeability over the corresponding csgb li and benson 2015 rabinovich et al 2015 1 the fine and coarse scale capillary pressures share the same curve while the water saturation of fsgbs over a specific csgb varies 2 for the capillary pressure curve firstly select a small capillary pressure value then calculate the water saturation of each grid block over the coarse scale one by inverting the van genuchten p c f s w f function where the superscript f refers to the fine scale parameter this is achievable because capillary equilibrium is assumed here 3 similarly based on the determined fine scale water saturation in 2 calculate the co2 and water relative permeabilities of each fsgb over the coarse scale one by inverting the brooks corey k r f s w f function 4 increase the capillary pressure value and repeat steps 2 and 3 to obtain enough data points of the fine scale capillary pressure and relative permeability as aforementioned the conventional mfu neglects the location dependent fsgbs and interactions among them in this study percolation theory is adopted to compensate for this error to be more specific as fig 4 a shows the non wetting phase co2 herein can vertically invade the second grid block while one can expect the local capillary trapping below the first grid block this is because the first grid block cannot be invaded due to its high capillary entry pressure as for the second scenario shown in fig 4 b the non wetting phase saturation in both the first and second grid blocks are zero because the non wetting phase cannot overcome the high capillary entry pressure of the second one the details regarding the implementation are provided through eqs 2 to 4 which account for the impacts of the upstream capillary barrier on the co2 migration upscaling it is worth mentioning that the vertical ur is 2 in this study see fig 3 which is relatively smaller than other studies considering percolation theory behzadi and alvarado 2012 yang et al 2013 this is because most previous studies accounted for co2 brine multiphase flow in the 2d geological system in which the co2 migration in the horizontal direction is not as significant as the one in this study in other words applying a large vertical ur in the 3d geological system of this study results in losing calculation accuracy excessively 2 s w f 1 p c f u p s t r e a m p c entry 1 p c f p c entry s w f p c f p c f p c entry p c f u p s t r e a m p c entry 3 k rw f 1 p c f u p s t r e a m p c

entry so far the capillary pressure and relative permeability of each fsgb over a csgb have been determined next the volumetric average water saturation is calculated over the csgb at each capillary pressure value following the percolation implementation this is to determine the coarse scale capillary pressure curve s w c p c c where the superscript c refers to the coarse scale parameter as for the coarse scale relative permeability the effective phase permeabilities from each fsgb are firstly obtained see eq 5 then the power law averaging eq 6 which converts the directional permeability to a linearly averaged parameter is adopted to calculate the coarse scale effective phase permeabilities following that the coarse scale relative permeabilities are determined accordingly using eq 7 5 k eff f k r f k abs f 6 k eff c i 1 n k effi f ω n 1 ω 7 k r c k eff c k abs c where ω refers to the power exponent of averaging depending on the petrophysical property distribution in this study ω 0 3 which is obtained by a trial and error process calibrated by flow simulation on a small section of the model in addition to capillary pressure and relative permeability the rock type is also required in the simulator cmg gem nevertheless the implementation already mentioned generates 125 000 csgbs and the number of rock types in cmg gem cannot exceed 999 therefore for the convenience of the utilization of multiphase functions in cmg gem the coarse scale capillary pressure is applied to limit the number of rock types for instance the generated capillary pressure of csgbs all consist of 17 points and these 125 000 capillary pressure data owe identical saturation increment but the corresponding capillary pressure are different then for a specific csgb 17 ratios can be obtained by comparing the 17 capillary pressure values with the corresponding one from other csgb following that the number of rock types remains constant unless the averaged value of these 17 ratios is smaller than a threshold value this process is repeated until the capillary pressure data from all csgbs are compared in general the modified percolation based algorithm consists of three main sections 1 petrophysical properties are first averaged in the horizontal direction 2 the percolation theory is then utilized in the vertical direction to consider the effects of upstream capillary barrier on co2 brine multiphase flow upscaling 3 limit the number of rock types using the coarse scale capillary pressure curve fig 5 a clearly illustrates the workflow of the modified algorithm 2 2 2 zero correlation length some geological systems without apparent correlation length are also identified as the co2 geological candidates i e hulett formation in the powder river basin prb of wyoming in this study such geological systems are called the geological model with zero correlation length gmzcl for ease of description another modified percolation based upscaling algorithm applicable to the gmzcl is proposed in this section unlike gmlcl in section 2 2 1 the co2 horizontal migration is much less significant in gmzcl since the impacts of bedding layers on co2 migration are dramatically weakened therefore it can be concluded that co2 vertical migration is the main migration direction in gmzcl as fig 6 a shows some connected petrophysical property extremes might not be captured if the petrophysical property averaging is firstly performed in the horizontal direction hence the upscaling method applied in gmlcl is not computationally valid for the gmzcl in this section a new percolation based upscaling method is proposed accordingly as fig 6 b shows the vertical percolation is first considered with a vertical ur of 2 then the obtained four csgbs are further upscaled utilizing the multiphase flow function averaging the total ur identical to the one in gmlcl equals 8 the reason why such an upscaling method is proposed is that the co2 vertical migration dominates the multiphase flow in gmzcl in addition the percolation implementation is the same as that shown in fig 4 and eqs 2 to 4 the coarse scale relative permeability and capillary pressure averaging the blue rectangle in fig 5 b are conducted applying eqs 5 to 7 and volumetric averaging method saad et al 1995 respectively similarly the modified algorithm applicable to gmzcl also consists of three main sections 1 percolation theory is utilized in the vertical direction to consider the effects of upstream capillary barrier on co2 brine multiphase flow upscaling 2 multiphase flow function averaging is then adopted in the horizontal direction to populate the upscaled multiphase flow functions 3 limit the number of rock types using the coarse scale capillary pressure curve as shown in fig 5 b 3 results and discussion most of co2 tends to migrate upwardly due to buoyancy and accumulates at the top of the saline aquifer beneath the caprock so the average co2 saturation at the top of the saline aquifer is generally the focus of upscaling studies mouche et al 2010 this corresponds to the average co2 saturation in the sink region of this study as a result the fine and coarse scale models both are run in cmg gem compositional simulator in this study and then the results are compared to verify the reliability of the proposed upscaling methods in terms of average co2 saturation in the sink region 3 1 gmlcl 3 1 1 permeability field while co2 migrates in a saline aquifer with relatively large correlation length co2 might accumulate below fsgb at the beginning due to its relatively high capillary entry pressure then some of co2 tends to migrate horizontally driven by the capillary force considering this process the permeability of the four adjacent fsgbs in the same x y plane is averaged due to the small difference of petrophysical properties among them on the other hand the remaining co2 continuously accumulates below the generated csgb with high capillary entry pressure whether the csgb can be finally invaded depends on the relative strength of capillary pressure in contrast with the capillary entry pressure of csgb considering these scenarios the percolation based upscaling is conducted to generate the final coarse scale grid block fcsgb where the coarse scale permeability and multiphase flow functions are also involved in general these implementations constituent the main structure of the upscaling method havp fig 7 shows the fine scale and the corresponding coarse scale permeability fields of gmlcl from three different plane views at face value the locations of high permeability area white red and green colors in fine scale system are comparable to the ones observed in coarse scale system besides the averaged permeability in fine scale system is also similar to that in coarse scale system therefore the obtained coarse scale permeability field captures the main features of the fine scale permeability field which suggests the robustness of the proposed upscaling method to some degree to further verify the upscaled model the calculation results in terms of average co2 saturation are provided and discussed in the following section 3 1 2 average co2 saturation fig 8 a illustrates the average co2 saturation evolution in the sink region using the upscaled method of havp in gmlcl in the first 2000 days the co2 saturation resulting from the upscaled model matches well with the one from the fine scale model as the migration continues the difference of co2 saturation between the two models becomes larger however the most significant difference of co2 saturation between two models is still less than 10 after running roughly 20 000 days this again confirms the applicability of the havp in upscaling gmlcl in contrast with the case using havp in gmlcl the co2 saturation obtained from the coarse scale gmzcl using havp results in a poor match to results from the fine scale model this is because as fig 6 a shows the havp in gmzcl fails to consider the connected permeability extremes therefore one can expect the underestimation of local co2 capillary trapping capacity and more co2 bypasses the capillary barriers which gives rise to the faster co2 migration as shown in fig 8 b it is worth mentioning that the shape and magnitude of the coarse scale relative permeability and capillary pressure generated in this study depend on the petrophysical properties of the fine scale constituents besides this havp produces larger capillary entry pressure despite that the bypassed area which cannot be invaded by co2 due to its large capillary entry pressure is not very large in the coarse scale system this is because compared to the conventional multiphase flow function average method the proposed havp generates both larger co2 and brine mobilities which leads to a more stable displacement 3 2 gmzcl 3 2 1 permeability field as for gmzcl the eight adjacent fsgbs are firstly randomly selected then for each two adjacent fsgbs in the vertical direction they are upscaled by means of the percolation theory respectively four adjacent csgbs can be consequently determined in the horizontal direction following that the four adjacent csgbs are further upscaled into a fcsgb by averaging the multiphase flow functions unlike gmlcl the permeability distribution of gmzcl is highly disordered and no apparent correlation length can be observed the co2 horizontal migration is not as strong as the one in gmlcl due to the weakened effects of large bedding layers therefore one can expect that the co2 vertical migration controlled by capillary force and buoyancy dominates the post injection stage considering these characteristics of multiphase flow in gmzcl the vertical percolation is firstly utilized and the horizontal average is subsequently conducted the whole process refers to vpha fig 9 shows the fine scale and the corresponding coarse scale permeability fields of gmzcl from three plane views from fig 9 no evident permeability correlation between two models can be confirmed and some permeability extremes are absent in the coarse scale model this is because for randomly selected eight adjacent fsgbs some grid blocks with extremely low high permeability are adjacent to the grid blocks with normal permeability after experiencing percolation implementation these permeability extremes get averaged out in such a gmzcl considering the focus of this upscaled study is the average co2 saturation evolution in the sink region we further compare the average co2 saturation evolution in the sink region between two models in the following section to verify the upscaled method 3 2 2 average co2 saturation fig 10 a shows the average co2 saturation evolution in the sink region using the vpha in gmzcl clearly the computational error of the average co2 saturation between two models is negligible in the first 1000 days and the final computational error is roughly 6 after running 11 000 days which is a relatively small value therefore it illustrates the robustness of the vpha in upscaling gmzcl fig 10 b shows the average co2 saturation evolution in the sink region using the havp and vpha in gmlcl from fig 10 b the co2 migrates faster in the coarse scale gmlcl if adopting vpha which suggests that the features of large bedding layers fail to be captured this finding is important because it reveals that for such a three step upscaling method proposed in this study the order of directional upscaling depends on the dominant direction of co2 migration to be more specific no apparent large bedding layers are visible in gmzcl then the effects of capillary barriers on co2 migration is not significant and the co2 vertical migration dominates the post injection stage therefore the vertical percolation in vpha should be considered as a priority when upscaling additionally from the comparison of fine scale results between fig 10 a and fig 10 b it can be concluded that the co2 migrates faster in the vertical direction in gmzcl thus resulting in the earlier co2 breakthrough in the sink region this phenomenon is consistent with other published studies meckel et al 2015 oh et al 2015 jackson and krevor 2020 which identified the role of bedding layers gmlcl on co2 vertical migration the capillary barriers that greatly slow down the co2 vertical migration 3 2 3 comparison with other methods prior to this research some upscaling methods regarding co2 brine multiphase flow have been developed behzadi and alvarado 2012 bashtani and kantzas 2020 cheng and rabinovich 2020 to highlight the advantage of our proposed method to upscale co2 migration in 3d heterogeneous geological model the comparison of average co2 saturation evolution resulting from five different upscaling methods are presented in fig 11 in this figure representative multiphase flow function mpff refers to the case where the several adjacent fsgbs are firstly randomly selected then the corresponding coarse scale mpff can be determined using the multiphase flow function average thereafter the number of grid blocks is reduced from 106 to 1 25 105 by averaging porosity and permeability over the entire fine scale model an ur of 8 following that the obtained single coarse scale mpff is assigned to all csgbs mpff average of eight grid blocks refers to the case that for each eight adjacent fsgbs their multiphase flow functions are directly averaged and no percolation is utilized moreover the method proposed in our previous study is also included in fig 11 where pure vertical percolation with ur of 5 is considered to upscale the co2 migration it is apparent that the proposed method successfully captures the main characters of the co2 saturation evolution in 3d heterogeneous geological system for the three commonly used methods representative mpff mpff average of eight grid blocks and havp weaken the impacts of capillary barriers bashtani and kantzas 2020 cheng and rabinovich 2020 resulting in the faster co2 vertical migration as for the pure vertical percolation yet it strengthens the effects of capillary barriers because it generally gives rise to higher coarse scale capillary entry pressure behzadi and alvarado 2012 therefore one can expect more local co2 capillary trapping and slower co2 breakthrough 4 case study preliminary studies have identified the upper minnelusa formation umf in the powder river basin prb of wyoming as one of the potential saline aquifers to volumetrically store co2 based on the carbon storage assurance facility enterprise carbonsafe study quillinan et al 2018 the well logging data and pictures showing the examples of the umf facies both reveal that low porosity and permeability bedding layers can be expected at the top of umf while no apparent bedding layers at the bottom of umf wang at al 2022 therefore a 3d heterogeneous conceptual model is constructed accordingly as fig 12 a shows the structural and petrophysical setup are the same as the one developed in section 2 1 except for the mix correlation lengths considered in this conceptual model to be more specific the main section of the model can be divided into three sub sections vertically where the correlation lengths of the 4 m thick region at the top 2 m thick region in the middle and 4 m thick region at the bottom are 4 m 1 m 0 m 1 2 m 0 3 m 0 m 0 m 0 m 0 m respectively see fig 12 b this setup is to represent the target saline aquifer umf of wyoming because varied correlation lengths are observed in this eolian sandstone the combined method of havp vpha is applied to populate the upscaled permeability and multiphase flow functions for example the havp is utilized for the top and middle regions since there exist relatively obvious bedding layers large correlation length as for the bottom region vpha is adopted to carry out the upscaling due to the negligible correlation length the average co2 saturation evolutions resulting from the fine and coarse scale models with ur of 8 are shown in fig 13 in the first 1000 days the computation error is negligible while it becomes larger at the late time specifically the average error is higher than the two models considering single correlation length in sections 3 1 and 3 2 this is because compared to the other two models the permeability contrast is greater in this conceptual model which makes it much more difficult to upscale accurately despite this the error in terms of co2 saturation between the fine scale model and coarse scale model 8 is just approximately 8 after 11 000 days which is computationally acceptable furthermore to emphasize the applicability of the upscaling approach the co2 saturation evolution resulting from the coarse model with a distinct ur of 64 is also shown in fig 13 similarly the difference of co2 saturation between the fine and coarse scale models 64 can be ignored in the first 1000 days as expected the coarse scale model 64 produces larger calculation error from 1000 days to 4000 days due to the larger ur nevertheless its calculation error lessens in contrast to the coarse scale model 8 at the late time table 1 shows the simulation time and material balance error of the fine scale and two coarse models although the coarse scale model 8 leads to lower overall computational error see fig 13 the calculation time of coarse scale model 64 just occupies 1 400 to the one from fine scale model while the coarse scale model 8 gives an order of magnitude reduction in computational cost as is known the upscaling technique aims at reaching a balance between computational cost and flow features maintenance as a result caution should be exercised when upscaling co2 migration in such 3d geological systems additionally it is worth mentioning that the proposed approach enables primary co2 migration mechanisms maintenance with much better accuracy in contrast to other commonly used methods even though different urs are considered 5 conclusions based on percolation theory this research proposes two modified methods suitable for upscaling the co2 migration during post injection stage in 3d heterogeneous geological models with large and zero correlation lengths respectively the proposed upscaling methods consist of two main steps percolation and average which both are related to the directional upscaling the order of directional upscaling depends on the dominant co2 migration direction for the fine scale geological model with large correlation length co2 horizontal migration controlled by capillary force is strong this is contributed to the role of bedding structure on co2 migration capillary barriers therefore porosity and permeability average in the horizontal direction should be firstly conducted due to the small difference of petrophysical properties among the fine scale grid blocks within correlation length the vertical percolation can be subsequently applied to account for the location dependent multiphase flow functions this method refers to horizontal average vertical percolation as for the fine scale geological model with zero correlation length apparent bedding structure cannot be expected in other words co2 horizontal migration is insignificant and vertical migration dominates the multiphase flow driven by capillary force and buoyancy as a result vertical upscaling using percolation should be the priority to perform then average the multiphase flow functions in the horizontal direction which refers to vertical percolation horizontal average besides the computational errors suggest that horizontal average vertical percolation is not suitable for fine scale geological model with zero correlation length because it fails to capture the connected permeability extremes also vertical percolation horizontal average is inappropriate to fine scale geological model with large correlation length because it weakens the impacts of capillary barriers during co2 migration the comparison among five different methods in terms of averaged co2 saturation evolution in the geological model with zero correlation length highlights the advantage of the proposed upscaling method for instance representative multiphase flow function multiphase flow function average of eight grid blocks and horizontal average vertical percolation weaken the influences of capillary barriers while the pure vertical percolation gives rise to higher coarse scale capillary entry pressure as a case verification the combined upscaling method horizontal average vertical percolation and vertical percolation horizontal average produces an acceptable computational error in terms of averaged co2 saturation between the fine scale and coarse scale

2945,numerical reservoir simulation of co2 storage in geological formations is computationally expensive due to the complex and often coupled multiphase flow phenomena and the large spatial and temporal scales upscaling is a family of techniques used to decrease petrophysical degrees of freedom from a fine scale model to a coarser one such that the computational costs can be substantially reduced while maintaining key fine scale flow mechanisms at least approximately this research aims at developing methods suitable for upscaling co2 migration in 3d heterogeneous geological systems two percolation based methods are proposed to upscale the multiphase flow functions of the fine scale models with large and zero correlation lengths respectively to confirm the applicability of the proposed upscaling methods a case study is carried out the combination of the two methods is adopted to upscale a representative of eolian sandstones with mixed correlation lengths these are achieved thanks to the consideration of the dominant co2 migration direction in aquifers the computational errors between fine and coarse scale models in terms of averaged co2 saturation were less than 10 thereby demonstrating the robustness of the upscaling methods the advantages of the proposed method are also highlighted by comparing it with other commonly used upscaling approaches overall this research sheds light on the understanding of fine scale co2 migration in heterogeneous geological systems and illustrates the benefits of properly incorporating small scale capillary barriers effects into coarse grained scale models keywords upscaling post injection scenario capillary barriers co2 saturation multiphase flow modeling data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction reservoir numerical simulation enables the prediction of multiphase fluid migration and distribution in subsurface hydrology studies for simulations of oil water systems viscous forces dominate over capillary ones in regards to large scale observations in reservoirs as for co2 brine systems however capillary pressure effects are much more important largely due to the low flow rates fine scale variations in terms of capillary pressure namely capillary heterogeneity as well as permeability significantly impact co2 migration and distribution during and after the drainage process considerations of such fine scale variations are computationally expensive when modeling co2 migration in saline aquifers upscaling is defined as the coarse graining technology to translate petrophysical properties e g relative permeability and capillary pressure from a fine grid to a coarser one such that the computational costs can be substantially reduced while key aspects of the fine scale flow solution can be approximately maintained the accuracy of upscaling technologies varies with the type of fluid displacement process for example a method that is adequate for simulating single phase flow may not be suitable to model viscosity dominated multiphase flow processes on the other hand an approach appropriate for the latter may not be accurate enough when buoyancy driven displacement is considered therefore an applicable upscaling technique is required for co2 migration simulations to decrease the computational costs while simultaneously considering the aforementioned impacts various methods have been proposed to carry out large scale property averaging or coarse graining for two phase flow in heterogeneous porous media i e dynamic pseudo function method and steady state upscaling dynamic pseudo function method based on the fluid flow mass conservation at the boundaries of porous media fine scale simulations are run and the obtained pressure and saturation values at each fine grid block are utilized to determine the corresponding value at coarse scale model then the pseudo functions can be evaluated by darcy s law between adjacent coarse scale grid blocks csgbs kyte and berry 1975 bourgeat and jurak 2010 for example bolster et al 2009 and bolster et al 2011 obtained an effective large scale flow equation governing the saturation of the displacing fluid for the buckley leverett problem their models can quantify the influence of heterogeneity on the spatial and temporal variation of the saturation front thus enlarging the surface area between the fluids as well as the dissolution trapping capacity of co2 steady state upscaling in contrast to dynamic methods fine scale simulations are not required for steady state upscaling this approach mainly relies on having a dominant flow driving force namely either capillary force viscous force or gravity mantoglou and gelhar 1987 illustrated that large scale effective parameters for two phase flow systems rely on the stochastic parameters denoting local properties quintard and whitaker 1990 proposed a volume averaging alternative to determine the large scale capillary pressure and relative permeability curves later mouche et al 2010 adopted an upscaling method to simulate the vertical migration of co2 plume through periodic layered porous media by using homogenization more recently behzadi and alvarado 2012 provided an upscaled model for co2 vertical migration during the post injection stage with the assistance of percolation considerations even more recently cheng and rabinovich 2020 determined the upscaled co2 saturation distribution applying several commonly used methods which they used to propose an optimization based technique to characterize the co2 vertical migration however for the post co2 injection simulation at field scale one must realize that the co2 brine flow in saline aquifers cannot be completely dominated by just one force at all spatial and temporal scales therefore an intermediate method considering both effects of capillary force and buoyancy is required viscous force effects can be ignored due to the low flow rate of co2 stephen et al 2000 for co2 brine systems the key role of capillary heterogeneity on co2 trapping simulations has been confirmed and computing upscaled quantities under capillary dominant conditions is generally relied upon to deal with capillary heterogeneity issues saadatpoor et al 2010 in this area 2 d heterogeneous upscaling models are frequently used due to their low computational cost yet 2 d models fine and coarse scales are not truly representative of the underground formations and some spatial heterogeneity characteristics important to co2 flow are ignored so these models cannot adequately mimic co2 migration for instance see fig 1 a the bedding layers are evident in the 2 d geological model in which the interaction between fluid flow and bedding layers cannot be ignored nevertheless for 3 d models the real spatial distribution of these bedding layers may differ from that observed in 2 d models as shown in fig 1 b in other words fluids must directly interact with bedding layers during co2 migration from the 2 d perspective whereas for 3 d model the interaction between bedding layers and co2 brine may be different as a result it is reasonable to conduct upscaling based on a 3 d fine scale model at present many of the published multiphase flow upscaling approaches incorporate location independent relative permeability and only saturation dependent functions this approach leads to identical rock fluid functions regardless of rock type and other local characteristics of the rock the most relevant consequence of these approaches is that they fail to simulate the multiphase displacement process realistically and potentially serving as poor predictor to compensate for this error behzadi and alvarado 2012 proposed and tested an upscaling method for co2 vertical migration during the post injection stage in eolian systems based on percolation theory however the proposed method could be applied only on 2 d models which ignores critical effects of spatial heterogeneity on co2 migration in 3 d geological systems this can be interpreted as upscaling essentially in the vertical direction neglecting the impact of the lateral correlation length in the geological system uncorrelated random models to resolve these limitations we propose modified percolation based methods to upscale the co2 migration during a post injection period in 3 d heterogeneous geological models with varied correlation lengths such that the co2 migration behaviors can be captured reasonably several research works have studied the feasibility of co2 sequestration in deep saline aquifers keating et al 2016 dai et al 2018 and in hydrocarbon reservoirs dai et al 2014 pan et al 2016 jia et al 2018 four main trapping mechanisms are recognized in the context of co2 geological storage structural stratigraphic residual phase solubility and mineral trapping the trapping contribution for each of them is time dependent although they corporately control the co2 migration and distribution benson and cole 2008 however our previous study illustrated that capillary heterogeneity serves two main roles during co2 migration guiding the direction of co2 flow and offering the possibility of capillary trapping kou et al 2021 thus leading to the local evident co2 saturation contrast this mechanism differs from the aforementioned four mechanisms in terms of scale and magnitude behzadi and alvarado 2012 for instance the current study differentiated the contribution between capillary heterogeneity trapping and residual trapping from the land trapping model harris et al 2021 this study aims at developing the upscaled co2 migration models while maintaining the main capillary heterogeneity features of fine scale models it is worth mentioning that since field scale hydrodynamic simulation is complex and time consuming and dominant at earlier years during storage we focused our efforts on that portion and ignored geochemical contributions in this portion of our research though it will be the focus of future work given the dominance of non geochemical effects this study could be a critical reference for co2 storage in saline aquifers where co2 hydrodynamic trapping dominates over geochemical trapping this article is organized as follows i the structural and petrophysical setup of the fine scale geological models and the corresponding upscaling approaches are shown in the materials and methods section ii following that the comparison of average co2 saturation resulting from the simulations between the fine scale model and the corresponding upscaled model are performed to verify the reliability of the proposed upscaling methods in the results and discussion section iii a case study is subsequently provided to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed upscaling methods in the case study section iv then the conclusions obtained in this study are accordingly highlighted in the conclusions section 2 materials and methods 2 1 fine scale geological model in this section the base fine scale geological model is first generated in petrel a 3d geological modeling software petrel 2021 then the fine scale geological model is imported into the cmg gem a compositional unconventional simulator computer modeling group 2019 2 1 1 structural model the 3d geological model is vertically divided into three regions the source region at the bottom where co2 is initially located the main section or the fine scale geological model in the middle and the sink region at the top where co2 finally accumulates see fig 2 the dimensions of the source main section and sink all are 40 m x 10 m y 10 m z in which the grid block sizes are 0 4 m x 0 1 m y 10 m z 0 4 m x 0 1 m y 0 1 m z and 0 4 m x 0 1 m y 10 m z respectively the source and sink regions are homogeneous whereas the main section exhibits heterogeneous permeability and capillary pressure the no flow lateral boundary conditions are considered to ignore convective flow no flow boundary conditions are also expected at the top of sink and the bottom of source which both are contacted by impermeable seals the setup represents the post co2 injection scenario by assuming all co2 is initially located at the bottom source region this is because for a relatively thick saline aquifer co2 is generally injected into the bottom of saline aquifer to elongate the time required for co2 to touch caprock therefore most co2 accumulates at the bottom of saline aquifer during injection stage as the simulation starts co2 firstly flows into the main section from source region then migrates through the main section controlled by capillary force and buoyancy following that enters and accumulates in the sink region at the top 2 1 2 petrophysical model porosity and relative permeability are uniform throughout the entire fine scale geological model to reduce the computational cost to be more specific porosity is a constant 0 27 and relative permeability is generated by applying the brooks corey model in which residual water saturation and co2 end point relative permeability are 0 27 and 0 26 respectively the porosity and relative permeability setups are comparable to what we used in previous work which has proved the corresponding computational efficiency behzadi and alvarado 2012 for absolute permeability sequential gaussian simulation is used to generate a log normally distributed absolute permeability field the mean value and standard deviation of the permeability field are 20 md and 30 respectively ranging from 0 1 to 1000 md from the well log data and lab measurements the permeability distribution of target saline aquifers is expected to be quite complex as a result the representative properties values which cover most of the range were selected here despite that these properties are still representative of the real geological system to a significant degree it is worth noting that the color bar range of permeability in fig 2 is from 1 to 100 md which is to show the permeability contrast clearly in the fine scale geological model the absolute permeability anisotropy is ignored e g k x k y k z meanwhile two correlation lengths in the 3d fine scale geological model are considered 4 m 1 m 0 m and 0 m 0 m 0 m respectively as shown in fig 2 c and d specifically the correlation length setup of 4 m 1 m 0 m is to make a comparison with our previous study which considered a correlation length of 4 m 0 m in x z plane of the 2 d geological model behzadi and alvarado 2012 besides such a correlation length setup is also inspired by the petrophysical features of the eolian sandstone minnelusa sandstone formation in wyoming as for capillary pressure the leverett j function is applied to parameterize the location dependent permeability dependent in this study capillary pressure see eq 1 1 j s w p c σ c o s θ k ϕ where s w is the water saturation pc is the capillary pressure which is produced by the van genuchten model σ and θ are co2 water interfacial tension and contact angle respectively which are kept constant in this study k is the absolute permeability and ϕ is the porosity 2 2 upscaling methods saadatpoor et al 2010 and behzadi et al 2011 have computationally confirmed that even micro and meso scale petrophysical heterogeneity can dramatically influence co2 migration and distribution as a result it is necessary to develop an upscaling approach for preserving relevant fine scale effects for most cases multiphase flow upscaling mfu is directly utilized for example relative permeability and capillary pressure are upscaled through geometric averaging and volumetric averaging respectively behzadi and alvarado 2012 cheng and rabinovich 2020 however this technique is not physically sound since it fails to account for the connected extremes e g the permeability from one of the fine scale grid blocks fsgbs located in a csgb might be extremely either small or large dependent on the size of the correlation length this study proposes two different percolation based upscaling approaches to compensate for this error upscaling is conducted in a cube which includes eight adjacent fsgbs hence the upscaling ratio ur the number of fsgbs to the number of csgb equals 8 2 2 1 large correlation length the geological system with apparent correlation length can be commonly observed in eolian sandstones i e minnelusa formation in the powder river basin prb of wyoming wang et al 2022 the petrophysical properties are inter correlated within a distance of the order of the correlation length so the petrophysical property variation is not evident on the other hand the low value petrophysical properties bedding layers within correlation length horizontally guide the co2 migration representing that co2 migration along the horizontal direction is significant in the geological model with large correlation length gmlcl as a result the correlation length is included in the x y plane and the petrophysical properties of four adjacent fsgbs in the same x y plane can be firstly averaged hence the one csgb is consequently produced as fig 3 shows subsequently the following techniques are introduced to populate the fine scale capillary pressure and relative permeability over the corresponding csgb li and benson 2015 rabinovich et al 2015 1 the fine and coarse scale capillary pressures share the same curve while the water saturation of fsgbs over a specific csgb varies 2 for the capillary pressure curve firstly select a small capillary pressure value then calculate the water saturation of each grid block over the coarse scale one by inverting the van genuchten p c f s w f function where the superscript f refers to the fine scale parameter this is achievable because capillary equilibrium is assumed here 3 similarly based on the determined fine scale water saturation in 2 calculate the co2 and water relative permeabilities of each fsgb over the coarse scale one by inverting the brooks corey k r f s w f function 4 increase the capillary pressure value and repeat steps 2 and 3 to obtain enough data points of the fine scale capillary pressure and relative permeability as aforementioned the conventional mfu neglects the location dependent fsgbs and interactions among them in this study percolation theory is adopted to compensate for this error to be more specific as fig 4 a shows the non wetting phase co2 herein can vertically invade the second grid block while one can expect the local capillary trapping below the first grid block this is because the first grid block cannot be invaded due to its high capillary entry pressure as for the second scenario shown in fig 4 b the non wetting phase saturation in both the first and second grid blocks are zero because the non wetting phase cannot overcome the high capillary entry pressure of the second one the details regarding the implementation are provided through eqs 2 to 4 which account for the impacts of the upstream capillary barrier on the co2 migration upscaling it is worth mentioning that the vertical ur is 2 in this study see fig 3 which is relatively smaller than other studies considering percolation theory behzadi and alvarado 2012 yang et al 2013 this is because most previous studies accounted for co2 brine multiphase flow in the 2d geological system in which the co2 migration in the horizontal direction is not as significant as the one in this study in other words applying a large vertical ur in the 3d geological system of this study results in losing calculation accuracy excessively 2 s w f 1 p c f u p s t r e a m p c entry 1 p c f p c entry s w f p c f p c f p c entry p c f u p s t r e a m p c entry 3 k rw f 1 p c f u p s t r e a m p c

entry so far the capillary pressure and relative permeability of each fsgb over a csgb have been determined next the volumetric average water saturation is calculated over the csgb at each capillary pressure value following the percolation implementation this is to determine the coarse scale capillary pressure curve s w c p c c where the superscript c refers to the coarse scale parameter as for the coarse scale relative permeability the effective phase permeabilities from each fsgb are firstly obtained see eq 5 then the power law averaging eq 6 which converts the directional permeability to a linearly averaged parameter is adopted to calculate the coarse scale effective phase permeabilities following that the coarse scale relative permeabilities are determined accordingly using eq 7 5 k eff f k r f k abs f 6 k eff c i 1 n k effi f ω n 1 ω 7 k r c k eff c k abs c where ω refers to the power exponent of averaging depending on the petrophysical property distribution in this study ω 0 3 which is obtained by a trial and error process calibrated by flow simulation on a small section of the model in addition to capillary pressure and relative permeability the rock type is also required in the simulator cmg gem nevertheless the implementation already mentioned generates 125 000 csgbs and the number of rock types in cmg gem cannot exceed 999 therefore for the convenience of the utilization of multiphase functions in cmg gem the coarse scale capillary pressure is applied to limit the number of rock types for instance the generated capillary pressure of csgbs all consist of 17 points and these 125 000 capillary pressure data owe identical saturation increment but the corresponding capillary pressure are different then for a specific csgb 17 ratios can be obtained by comparing the 17 capillary pressure values with the corresponding one from other csgb following that the number of rock types remains constant unless the averaged value of these 17 ratios is smaller than a threshold value this process is repeated until the capillary pressure data from all csgbs are compared in general the modified percolation based algorithm consists of three main sections 1 petrophysical properties are first averaged in the horizontal direction 2 the percolation theory is then utilized in the vertical direction to consider the effects of upstream capillary barrier on co2 brine multiphase flow upscaling 3 limit the number of rock types using the coarse scale capillary pressure curve fig 5 a clearly illustrates the workflow of the modified algorithm 2 2 2 zero correlation length some geological systems without apparent correlation length are also identified as the co2 geological candidates i e hulett formation in the powder river basin prb of wyoming in this study such geological systems are called the geological model with zero correlation length gmzcl for ease of description another modified percolation based upscaling algorithm applicable to the gmzcl is proposed in this section unlike gmlcl in section 2 2 1 the co2 horizontal migration is much less significant in gmzcl since the impacts of bedding layers on co2 migration are dramatically weakened therefore it can be concluded that co2 vertical migration is the main migration direction in gmzcl as fig 6 a shows some connected petrophysical property extremes might not be captured if the petrophysical property averaging is firstly performed in the horizontal direction hence the upscaling method applied in gmlcl is not computationally valid for the gmzcl in this section a new percolation based upscaling method is proposed accordingly as fig 6 b shows the vertical percolation is first considered with a vertical ur of 2 then the obtained four csgbs are further upscaled utilizing the multiphase flow function averaging the total ur identical to the one in gmlcl equals 8 the reason why such an upscaling method is proposed is that the co2 vertical migration dominates the multiphase flow in gmzcl in addition the percolation implementation is the same as that shown in fig 4 and eqs 2 to 4 the coarse scale relative permeability and capillary pressure averaging the blue rectangle in fig 5 b are conducted applying eqs 5 to 7 and volumetric averaging method saad et al 1995 respectively similarly the modified algorithm applicable to gmzcl also consists of three main sections 1 percolation theory is utilized in the vertical direction to consider the effects of upstream capillary barrier on co2 brine multiphase flow upscaling 2 multiphase flow function averaging is then adopted in the horizontal direction to populate the upscaled multiphase flow functions 3 limit the number of rock types using the coarse scale capillary pressure curve as shown in fig 5 b 3 results and discussion most of co2 tends to migrate upwardly due to buoyancy and accumulates at the top of the saline aquifer beneath the caprock so the average co2 saturation at the top of the saline aquifer is generally the focus of upscaling studies mouche et al 2010 this corresponds to the average co2 saturation in the sink region of this study as a result the fine and coarse scale models both are run in cmg gem compositional simulator in this study and then the results are compared to verify the reliability of the proposed upscaling methods in terms of average co2 saturation in the sink region 3 1 gmlcl 3 1 1 permeability field while co2 migrates in a saline aquifer with relatively large correlation length co2 might accumulate below fsgb at the beginning due to its relatively high capillary entry pressure then some of co2 tends to migrate horizontally driven by the capillary force considering this process the permeability of the four adjacent fsgbs in the same x y plane is averaged due to the small difference of petrophysical properties among them on the other hand the remaining co2 continuously accumulates below the generated csgb with high capillary entry pressure whether the csgb can be finally invaded depends on the relative strength of capillary pressure in contrast with the capillary entry pressure of csgb considering these scenarios the percolation based upscaling is conducted to generate the final coarse scale grid block fcsgb where the coarse scale permeability and multiphase flow functions are also involved in general these implementations constituent the main structure of the upscaling method havp fig 7 shows the fine scale and the corresponding coarse scale permeability fields of gmlcl from three different plane views at face value the locations of high permeability area white red and green colors in fine scale system are comparable to the ones observed in coarse scale system besides the averaged permeability in fine scale system is also similar to that in coarse scale system therefore the obtained coarse scale permeability field captures the main features of the fine scale permeability field which suggests the robustness of the proposed upscaling method to some degree to further verify the upscaled model the calculation results in terms of average co2 saturation are provided and discussed in the following section 3 1 2 average co2 saturation fig 8 a illustrates the average co2 saturation evolution in the sink region using the upscaled method of havp in gmlcl in the first 2000 days the co2 saturation resulting from the upscaled model matches well with the one from the fine scale model as the migration continues the difference of co2 saturation between the two models becomes larger however the most significant difference of co2 saturation between two models is still less than 10 after running roughly 20 000 days this again confirms the applicability of the havp in upscaling gmlcl in contrast with the case using havp in gmlcl the co2 saturation obtained from the coarse scale gmzcl using havp results in a poor match to results from the fine scale model this is because as fig 6 a shows the havp in gmzcl fails to consider the connected permeability extremes therefore one can expect the underestimation of local co2 capillary trapping capacity and more co2 bypasses the capillary barriers which gives rise to the faster co2 migration as shown in fig 8 b it is worth mentioning that the shape and magnitude of the coarse scale relative permeability and capillary pressure generated in this study depend on the petrophysical properties of the fine scale constituents besides this havp produces larger capillary entry pressure despite that the bypassed area which cannot be invaded by co2 due to its large capillary entry pressure is not very large in the coarse scale system this is because compared to the conventional multiphase flow function average method the proposed havp generates both larger co2 and brine mobilities which leads to a more stable displacement 3 2 gmzcl 3 2 1 permeability field as for gmzcl the eight adjacent fsgbs are firstly randomly selected then for each two adjacent fsgbs in the vertical direction they are upscaled by means of the percolation theory respectively four adjacent csgbs can be consequently determined in the horizontal direction following that the four adjacent csgbs are further upscaled into a fcsgb by averaging the multiphase flow functions unlike gmlcl the permeability distribution of gmzcl is highly disordered and no apparent correlation length can be observed the co2 horizontal migration is not as strong as the one in gmlcl due to the weakened effects of large bedding layers therefore one can expect that the co2 vertical migration controlled by capillary force and buoyancy dominates the post injection stage considering these characteristics of multiphase flow in gmzcl the vertical percolation is firstly utilized and the horizontal average is subsequently conducted the whole process refers to vpha fig 9 shows the fine scale and the corresponding coarse scale permeability fields of gmzcl from three plane views from fig 9 no evident permeability correlation between two models can be confirmed and some permeability extremes are absent in the coarse scale model this is because for randomly selected eight adjacent fsgbs some grid blocks with extremely low high permeability are adjacent to the grid blocks with normal permeability after experiencing percolation implementation these permeability extremes get averaged out in such a gmzcl considering the focus of this upscaled study is the average co2 saturation evolution in the sink region we further compare the average co2 saturation evolution in the sink region between two models in the following section to verify the upscaled method 3 2 2 average co2 saturation fig 10 a shows the average co2 saturation evolution in the sink region using the vpha in gmzcl clearly the computational error of the average co2 saturation between two models is negligible in the first 1000 days and the final computational error is roughly 6 after running 11 000 days which is a relatively small value therefore it illustrates the robustness of the vpha in upscaling gmzcl fig 10 b shows the average co2 saturation evolution in the sink region using the havp and vpha in gmlcl from fig 10 b the co2 migrates faster in the coarse scale gmlcl if adopting vpha which suggests that the features of large bedding layers fail to be captured this finding is important because it reveals that for such a three step upscaling method proposed in this study the order of directional upscaling depends on the dominant direction of co2 migration to be more specific no apparent large bedding layers are visible in gmzcl then the effects of capillary barriers on co2 migration is not significant and the co2 vertical migration dominates the post injection stage therefore the vertical percolation in vpha should be considered as a priority when upscaling additionally from the comparison of fine scale results between fig 10 a and fig 10 b it can be concluded that the co2 migrates faster in the vertical direction in gmzcl thus resulting in the earlier co2 breakthrough in the sink region this phenomenon is consistent with other published studies meckel et al 2015 oh et al 2015 jackson and krevor 2020 which identified the role of bedding layers gmlcl on co2 vertical migration the capillary barriers that greatly slow down the co2 vertical migration 3 2 3 comparison with other methods prior to this research some upscaling methods regarding co2 brine multiphase flow have been developed behzadi and alvarado 2012 bashtani and kantzas 2020 cheng and rabinovich 2020 to highlight the advantage of our proposed method to upscale co2 migration in 3d heterogeneous geological model the comparison of average co2 saturation evolution resulting from five different upscaling methods are presented in fig 11 in this figure representative multiphase flow function mpff refers to the case where the several adjacent fsgbs are firstly randomly selected then the corresponding coarse scale mpff can be determined using the multiphase flow function average thereafter the number of grid blocks is reduced from 106 to 1 25 105 by averaging porosity and permeability over the entire fine scale model an ur of 8 following that the obtained single coarse scale mpff is assigned to all csgbs mpff average of eight grid blocks refers to the case that for each eight adjacent fsgbs their multiphase flow functions are directly averaged and no percolation is utilized moreover the method proposed in our previous study is also included in fig 11 where pure vertical percolation with ur of 5 is considered to upscale the co2 migration it is apparent that the proposed method successfully captures the main characters of the co2 saturation evolution in 3d heterogeneous geological system for the three commonly used methods representative mpff mpff average of eight grid blocks and havp weaken the impacts of capillary barriers bashtani and kantzas 2020 cheng and rabinovich 2020 resulting in the faster co2 vertical migration as for the pure vertical percolation yet it strengthens the effects of capillary barriers because it generally gives rise to higher coarse scale capillary entry pressure behzadi and alvarado 2012 therefore one can expect more local co2 capillary trapping and slower co2 breakthrough 4 case study preliminary studies have identified the upper minnelusa formation umf in the powder river basin prb of wyoming as one of the potential saline aquifers to volumetrically store co2 based on the carbon storage assurance facility enterprise carbonsafe study quillinan et al 2018 the well logging data and pictures showing the examples of the umf facies both reveal that low porosity and permeability bedding layers can be expected at the top of umf while no apparent bedding layers at the bottom of umf wang at al 2022 therefore a 3d heterogeneous conceptual model is constructed accordingly as fig 12 a shows the structural and petrophysical setup are the same as the one developed in section 2 1 except for the mix correlation lengths considered in this conceptual model to be more specific the main section of the model can be divided into three sub sections vertically where the correlation lengths of the 4 m thick region at the top 2 m thick region in the middle and 4 m thick region at the bottom are 4 m 1 m 0 m 1 2 m 0 3 m 0 m 0 m 0 m 0 m respectively see fig 12 b this setup is to represent the target saline aquifer umf of wyoming because varied correlation lengths are observed in this eolian sandstone the combined method of havp vpha is applied to populate the upscaled permeability and multiphase flow functions for example the havp is utilized for the top and middle regions since there exist relatively obvious bedding layers large correlation length as for the bottom region vpha is adopted to carry out the upscaling due to the negligible correlation length the average co2 saturation evolutions resulting from the fine and coarse scale models with ur of 8 are shown in fig 13 in the first 1000 days the computation error is negligible while it becomes larger at the late time specifically the average error is higher than the two models considering single correlation length in sections 3 1 and 3 2 this is because compared to the other two models the permeability contrast is greater in this conceptual model which makes it much more difficult to upscale accurately despite this the error in terms of co2 saturation between the fine scale model and coarse scale model 8 is just approximately 8 after 11 000 days which is computationally acceptable furthermore to emphasize the applicability of the upscaling approach the co2 saturation evolution resulting from the coarse model with a distinct ur of 64 is also shown in fig 13 similarly the difference of co2 saturation between the fine and coarse scale models 64 can be ignored in the first 1000 days as expected the coarse scale model 64 produces larger calculation error from 1000 days to 4000 days due to the larger ur nevertheless its calculation error lessens in contrast to the coarse scale model 8 at the late time table 1 shows the simulation time and material balance error of the fine scale and two coarse models although the coarse scale model 8 leads to lower overall computational error see fig 13 the calculation time of coarse scale model 64 just occupies 1 400 to the one from fine scale model while the coarse scale model 8 gives an order of magnitude reduction in computational cost as is known the upscaling technique aims at reaching a balance between computational cost and flow features maintenance as a result caution should be exercised when upscaling co2 migration in such 3d geological systems additionally it is worth mentioning that the proposed approach enables primary co2 migration mechanisms maintenance with much better accuracy in contrast to other commonly used methods even though different urs are considered 5 conclusions based on percolation theory this research proposes two modified methods suitable for upscaling the co2 migration during post injection stage in 3d heterogeneous geological models with large and zero correlation lengths respectively the proposed upscaling methods consist of two main steps percolation and average which both are related to the directional upscaling the order of directional upscaling depends on the dominant co2 migration direction for the fine scale geological model with large correlation length co2 horizontal migration controlled by capillary force is strong this is contributed to the role of bedding structure on co2 migration capillary barriers therefore porosity and permeability average in the horizontal direction should be firstly conducted due to the small difference of petrophysical properties among the fine scale grid blocks within correlation length the vertical percolation can be subsequently applied to account for the location dependent multiphase flow functions this method refers to horizontal average vertical percolation as for the fine scale geological model with zero correlation length apparent bedding structure cannot be expected in other words co2 horizontal migration is insignificant and vertical migration dominates the multiphase flow driven by capillary force and buoyancy as a result vertical upscaling using percolation should be the priority to perform then average the multiphase flow functions in the horizontal direction which refers to vertical percolation horizontal average besides the computational errors suggest that horizontal average vertical percolation is not suitable for fine scale geological model with zero correlation length because it fails to capture the connected permeability extremes also vertical percolation horizontal average is inappropriate to fine scale geological model with large correlation length because it weakens the impacts of capillary barriers during co2 migration the comparison among five different methods in terms of averaged co2 saturation evolution in the geological model with zero correlation length highlights the advantage of the proposed upscaling method for instance representative multiphase flow function multiphase flow function average of eight grid blocks and horizontal average vertical percolation weaken the influences of capillary barriers while the pure vertical percolation gives rise to higher coarse scale capillary entry pressure as a case verification the combined upscaling method horizontal average vertical percolation and vertical percolation horizontal average produces an acceptable computational error in terms of averaged co2 saturation between the fine scale and coarse scale geological systems with mix correlation lengths e g eolian sandstones this confirms the applicability of the proposed upscaling methods nevertheless the case study provided here is based on a conceptual model because the 3 d model fully representative of upper minnelusa formation is still unavailable at present as a result the proposed method can be further modified once the real geological model is available besides the mineral trapping is ignored in this work which will be the focus of our future work despite that the main co2 migration mechanisms during post injection stage in 3d heterogenous geological systems can be maintained in the resulting upscaled models that is to say this work can be applied to predict the co2 saturation evolution beneath caprock with much less

contaminated sites has long been one of the main environmental concerns by the general public and environmental professionals naseri rad et al 2020 wang et al 2021 despite decades of contaminated site remediation persistent groundwater contaminant plumes higher than contaminant concentration limits are often found after active remediation closure adamson et al 2016 wanner et al 2018 this phenomenon is largely attributed to a process known as back diffusion and it is due to the reversal of the concentration gradient between the higher permeable region and the lower permeable region and the transfer of solute from the lower permeability region back to the higher permeability region atteia et al 2005 parker and kim 2015 after the completion of primary remediation of groundwater contaminated sites low permeability lenses often act as secondary contaminant sources and release contaminant through back diffusion resulting in rebound of concentration of contaminant of concern in the permeable region parker et al 2008 sale et al 2008 removal of contaminant in low permeability regions of persistent secondary contaminant sources is one of the major challenges of groundwater remediation liu and ball 2002 chapman and parker 2005 yan et al 2016 therefore it is of great significance to carry out theoretical and experimental research on remediation of low permeability secondary contaminant sources to tackle this grand challenge that has haunted environmental professionals for such a long time the first attempt of understanding groundwater remediation of low permeability media can be traced back to the concept of non fickian transport in the 1980s and the subsequent rise of the stochastic hydrology theory of non fickian transport which deviates substantially from the traditional fickian transport and brownian motion theory in homogeneous media guo et al 2021 from a theoretical perspective difficulties of understanding contaminant remediation in low permeability lenses are as follows first the permeability contrast between the low permeability lenses and the background permeable aquifer could lead to the so called preferential flow in high permeability region and circumfluence flow in low permeability lenses conrad et al 2002 mulligan and wang 2006 hayden et al 2006 dermont et al 2008 zhong et al 2011 west and kueper 2012 hao et al 2013 qiao et al 2015 zhao et al 2018 second the flow rates in the low permeability lenses are significantly smaller than those in the background permeable aquifer making it difficult for contaminant trapped in low permeability lenses to migrate out of the lenses huang et al 2020a huang et al 2020b ren et al 2021 third the soil particles in the low permeability lenses have large specific surface areas thus have strong adsorption effects on contaminants semer and reddy 1996 kuhlman and greenfield 1999 song et al 2016 cui 2019 considering above mentioned factors numerous studies have proposed many in situ methods to improve the remediation efficiency when low permeability lenses are presented for example multiphase displacement method corredor et al 2019 electrokinetic remediation method ma et al 2007 freeze thaw method rui et al 2019 and groundwater circulation wells gcws have been applied this study will focus on the remediation technology associated with gcws which refer to vertical circulation wells vcws only meaning that other types of circulation wells such as horizontal circulation wells will not be covered gcws are widely used in groundwater remediation and is based on the improvements of air sparging and pump and treat technology pu et al 2021 a traditional gcw system consists of an injection well screen segment and a pumping well screen segment in the same wellbore while these screen segments are separated vertically with a certain section of casing the choice of the separation distance between the injection and pumping segments depends on several factors such as the size of the contaminant plume the permeability of the aquifer and anisotropy of the aquifer etc kabala 1993 proposed the dipole flow test dft which separated a gcw into two chambers groundwater was pumped from the pumping chamber at the same rate as that injected into the injection chamber forming a three dimensional circulating dipole flow field xiang and kabala 1997 proposed a dft model for layered heterogeneous aquifers or aquifers with circulating wells on the basis of kabala 1993 model for a single layer homogeneous aquifer halihan and zlotnik 2002 established the drawdown expression with asymmetric flow field when the injection and pumping screen sections have different lengths to expand the applicability of the dft model sutton et al 2000 studied contaminant transport process driven by gcw for the first time by using a dipole flow test with a tracer dftt in addition dftt was also used to study contaminant transport processes in aquifers driven by tandem circulation well tcw where tcw is a pair of dipole wells with one dipole pumping water through the lower screen and injecting water through the upper screen and the other dipole well pumping water through the upper screen and injecting water through the lower section goltz et al 2008 carried out a study on solute transport based on dftt in tcw dftt has also been termed with different names such as the injection withdrawal test in novakowski et al 2004 the well to well tracer test in luo et al 2007 and the doublet test in zech et al 2018 meanwhile reiha 2007 analyzed the solute transport process of the dipole flow reactive tracer test dfrtt based on the finite volume method in recent years a series of derivative technologies associated with gcws have been developed by integrating physical chemical and biological processes such as novocs circulation wells allmon et al 1999 uvb circulation wells simon et al 1995 and ddc circulation wells schrauf 1996 which have shown various degrees of success in improving the remediation efficiency with the further development of technology johnson and simon 2007 noted that gcws can increase vertical groundwater flow through low permeability lenses thus flushing out contaminant that cannot be reached by a conventional vertical remediation well in which horizontal groundwater flow prevails tatti et al 2018 studied the back diffusion process of contaminant from low permeability lenses to the high permeability aquifer using sandbox experiments and image analysis techniques and demonstrated the necessity of using gcws to replace inefficient vertical pumping wells tatti et al 2019 carried out experimental and numerical evaluation of gcws in the source area of persistent low permeability contaminant and stated that gcws system was more suitable for remediation of low permeability aquifer contaminant than pump and treat technology paolo et al 2019 showed that gcws can extract groundwater from extremely low permeability layers strengthen the mobilization of contaminant from inaccessible areas and effectively mobilize contaminant captured or adsorbed in low permeability layers although previous studies have shown that using gcws to remediate low permeability aquifer is an effective technology there are several critical issues that have not been addressed and need our attention to advance the remediation technology of gcws for instance the theoretical mechanism of gcws to remediate secondary groundwater contaminant sources associated with low permeability lenses is unclear the evolution stages of remediation in low permeable lenses associated with gcws have not been fully quantified a quantitative method to evaluate the influence of flow and transport conditions on the remediation process of low permeable layers using gcws is not available in recent years the subsurface contamination caused by tetracycline antibiotics has attracted the attention of a large number of scholars peterson et al 2012 huang et al 2020a huang et al 2020b oxytetracycline otc is one of the most common and widely used antibiotics among tetracycline due to its broad activity and low cost zge et al 2014 studies have found that otc has potential toxicity carcinogenicity mutagenicity and endocrine interference zhang et al 2021 which can change the composition of microbial community in the subsurface environment and induce the generation of drug resistance genes in microorganisms thus significantly reduces the ability to treat bacterial infections malmqvist and munthe 2020 grgić et al 2021 when animals are fed with tetracycline antibiotics 60 90 of the applied antibiotics is discharged into the soil and water environment in the original form or metabolite halling sørensen et al 1998 due to the low degradation of otc blackwell et al 2005 causing groundwater pollution therefore remediation of otc contaminated groundwater is one of the major environmental concerns in recent years li et al 2021 in view of the above situation this study takes otc as a representative contaminant to illustrate the use of gcws to remediation otc in low permeability lenses this study employs the comsol program to establish a finite element numerical model for remediation of contaminant sources in low permeability regions by gcws considering biodegradation and adsorption the evolution process of contaminant removal rate in the low permeable lenses will be analyzed and several critical states and critical conditions associated with such an evolution process will be quantified for the first time finally the parameter sensitivity analysis is conducted for the system of concern this study is expected to provide a theoretical reference for gcws application of groundwater remediation associated with low permeability lenses in a contaminated aquifer 2 evolution process of contaminant removal in lenses and associated critical conditions to facilitate the description the study area contains a low permeability lens which is regarded as a secondary contaminant region as shown in fig 1 the lithologic characteristics of the system of concern is as follows a low permeability lens is located at certain depth below the surface in a homogeneous aquifer the gcw is the only driving force of hydrodynamic condition at the site without any background regional flow the lateral boundary conditions of flow are sufficiently far to have negligible influence on the operation of gcw and precipitation and evaporation are not presented the base of the aquifer is impermeable during the operation of gcw the rate of pumping and rate of injection are the same the whole system is hydrostatic before the operation of gcw and the water table is located at a certain depth below the surface the contaminant is assumed to exist uniformly in the porewater of low permeability lens in which adsorption and biodegradation of contaminant can occur for the purpose of demonstration the adsorption is assumed to be equilibrium following a linear isotherm and the biodegradation follows an exponentially decayed function of time the adsorption and biodegradation outside the lens are considered to be secondary effects which are not considered other than the contaminant sources in the low permeability lens there are no other contaminant sources or sinks it is also assumed that the extracted contaminant in the pumped water is completely removed before the water is injected back into the aquifer under the above assumptions contaminant removal factors in the lens include advection hydrodynamic dispersion biodegradation and adsorption among them advection as shown in the red curve in fig 2 hydrodynamic dispersion as shown in the green curve in fig 2 and adsorption as shown in the orange curve in fig 2 are the three driving factors of contaminant removal and the evolution process contains four stages namely an initial stage a rising stage a falling stage and a complete removal stage the evolution process of contaminant removal driven by biodegradation as shown in the blue curve in fig 2 includes three stages namely an initial stage a falling stage and a complete removal stage the detailed information can be seen in section s1 in supporting materials 2 1 evolution process of contaminant removal in different periods of gcw operation the relative magnitude of the four removal factors changes with time as shown in fig 2 during a certain period of operation there is always one removal factor that is the maximum among the four factors and this removal factor is called the dominant removal factors in this period further it is assumed that the molecular diffusion is far less than that of adsorption or biodegradation under the influence of the above mentioned multiple removal mechanisms the dominating removal factors are different in different periods of gcw operation and the evolution process is divided into four types namely the one stage evolution process the dominant role does not change the two stage evolution process the dominant role changes once the three stage evolution process the dominant role changes twice and the four stage evolution process the dominant role changes three times overall there are 22 evolutionary paths in total as shown in fig 3 in the evolution process the removal rate of contaminant in the lens driven by adsorption is either greater than or lower than that driven by biodegradation but the molecular diffusion is usually far less than those of adsorption or biodegradation when the gcw starts to operate if groundwater flow has not yet reached the lens the removal of contaminant by advection and mechanical dispersion does not exist therefore at the early phase of gcw operation there may be two dominant roles namely adsorption and biodegradation when the removal of contaminant by adsorption is stronger than that by biodegradation in the early phase of gcw operation there are two possible evolutions of contaminant removal when the contaminant removal rate driven by advection or hydrodynamic dispersion is weaker than that driven by adsorption the adsorption removal factor is dominant until the completion of remediation as shown in path 1 1 in fig 3 which is the one stage evolution process when the contaminant removal rate driven by advection or hydrodynamic dispersion is stronger than that driven by adsorption there will be two stages three stages and four stage evolution processes this will be discussed in the next paragraph otherwise when the removal of contaminant by biodegradation is stronger than that by adsorption in the early phase of gcw operation and biodegradation is always stronger than advection or hydrodynamic dispersion during the operation of the gcw it is another one stage evolution process dominated by biodegradation as shown in path a 1 in fig 3 for the evolution process with two stages three stages and four stages the first stage is either dominated by biodegradation if biodegradation is stronger than adsorption or by adsorption if adsorption is stronger than biodegradation for the evolutionary process with different stages dominated by biodegradation in the first stage its evolutionary path is similar to that with different stages dominated by adsorption in the first stage as shown in fig 3 therefore the following discussion will take the evolution process dominated by adsorption in the first stage as an example to illustrate the evolution process with different following stages when the contaminant removal driven by advection or hydrodynamic dispersion is stronger than that driven by adsorption the dominant role of adsorption in the process of contaminant removal will be changed to that driven by advection or hydrodynamic dispersion as shown in path 2 a 2 or path 2 b 2 in fig 3 this stage is called the evolution state of contaminant removal dominated by advection or hydrodynamic dispersion as the removal process driven by gcws continues the concentration of contaminants in the lens continues to decrease and the rate of contaminant removal by advection or hydrodynamic dispersion will also change at this time if the removal of contaminant driven by advection is always stronger than that driven by adsorption and hydrodynamic dispersion the removal of contaminant driven by advection will always play a dominant role until the completion of remediation and the evolution process will maintain path 2 a 2 which is the two stage evolution process or if the removal of contaminant driven by hydrodynamic dispersion is always stronger than that driven by adsorption and advection then the removal of contaminant driven by hydrodynamic dispersion will always play a dominant role until the completion of remediation and the evolution process will maintain in path 2 b 2 so the evolution process is also the two stage evolution process when the second stage of the evolution path is dominated by advection if the removal of contaminant driven by adsorption or hydrodynamic dispersion is stronger than that by advection the evolution path will change to path 3 b 3 or path 3 a 3 the stage of contaminant removal dominated by adsorption or hydrodynamic dispersion if the removal of contaminant driven by adsorption or hydrodynamic dispersion is always stronger than that by advection the removal of contaminant driven by adsorption or hydrodynamic dispersion will always play a dominant role until the completion of remediation and the evolution path remains in path 3 b 3 or path 3 a 3 which is the three stage evolution process when the second stage of the evolution path is dominated by hydrodynamic dispersion and if the third stage is dominated by advection or adsorption the evolution process is also the three stage evolution process as shown in path 3 c 3 or path 3 d 3 otherwise there will be a fourth evolution stage in the evolution path and the dominant role of this stage depends on the relative strength of each dominant factor of contaminant removal in the third stage as shown in path 4 a 4 4 b 4 or path 4 c 4 4 d 4 2 2 critical conditions of contaminant removal rate because the contaminant removal rates of the four factors are different this study calls the state corresponding to the contaminant removal rate that is about to exceed the dominant factor at this stage as the critical state this study also defines the state when the removal rates of the two factors are equal as the corresponding critical condition and the time associated with the critical condition is called the critical time according to the evolution process of contaminant removal rate in the lens there are multiple evolution states in the process of contaminant removal and different evolution states have different critical state the criteria of different evolution stages and the corresponding critical conditions are expressed as follows taking the evolution process dominated by adsorption in the first stage as an example to illustrate the critical conditions of the evolution process and the results are summarized in table 1 in the early phase of gcw operation if the removal effect of contaminant under adsorption is stronger than that under biodegradation namely 1 r s r b where r s π ρ s k p c t d π r b π 1 k b c t d π ρ s represents the mineral density of lens kg m3 k p represents the distribution coefficient m3 kg c represents the concentration of aqueous phase contaminant mol m3 k b represents the microbial degradation coefficient of contaminant 1 s π represents the volume of concern at this time corresponding to the first stage evolution process dominated by adsorption there may be one stage two stage three stage and four stage evolution paths as shown in table 1 if adsorption always plays a dominant role in the process of evolution namely 2 m a x f r s where f rs rb rd ra and f is the vector of element including the contaminant removal rate driven by adsorption rs biodegradation rb hydrodynamic dispersion rd and advection ra then the corresponding evolution path is one stage as shown by path 1 1 in fig 3 in the two stage three stage and four stage evolution paths if the second stage is transformed into an evolution process dominated by advection as shown in paths 2 a 2 3 a 2 3 b 2 4 a 2 4 b 2 in fig 3 the corresponding criterion is 3 m a x f r a where r a u ω c d ω in which u represents the darcy velocity m s is a vector and ω represents the area of concern the corresponding critical condition is 4 r s r a if the second stage is transformed into an evolution process dominated by hydrodynamic dispersion as shown by paths 2 b 2 3 c 2 3 d 2 4 c 2 and 4 d 2 in fig 3 the corresponding criterion is 5 m a x f r d where r d j ω d ω in which j represents the hydrodynamic dispersion flux mol m2 s and it equal d d d e c d d represents the dispersion coefficient of the contaminant m2 s which is a second order tensor and d e represents the effective molecular diffusion coefficient of the contaminant m2 s which is a second order tensor as well the detailed information can be seen in section s3 in supporting materials the corresponding critical condition is 6 r s r d the corresponding critical time associated with such a critical condition is denoted as tcr 1 2 if the second stage continues until the contaminant is completely removed the evolution path is the two stage evolution path otherwise there may be the three stage or four stage evolution path in the three stage and four stage evolution paths if the third stage changes from advection dominated to adsorption dominated as shown in path 3 b 3 and 4 b 3 in fig 3 the corresponding criterion is 7 m a x f r s and the corresponding critical condition is 8 r a r s if the third stage changes from advection dominated to hydrodynamic dispersion dominated as shown in path 3 a 3 and 4 a 3 in fig 3 the corresponding criterion is 9 m a x f r d and the corresponding critical condition is 10 r a r d in the three stage and four stage evolution paths if the third stage changes from the evolution process dominated by hydrodynamic dispersion to the evolution process dominated by adsorption as shown in path 3 d 3 and 4 d 3 in fig 3 the corresponding criterion is 11 m a x f r s and the corresponding critical condition is 12 r d r s if the third stage changes from the evolution dominated by hydrodynamic dispersion to the evolution dominated by advection as shown in path 3 c 3 and 4 c 3 in fig 3 the corresponding criterion is 13 m a x f r a and the corresponding critical condition is 14 r d r a the corresponding critical time associated with such a critical condition is denoted as tcr 2 3 if the third stage continues until the contaminant is completely removed the evolution path is the three stage evolution path otherwise the four stage evolution path may occur in the four stage evolution path if the fourth stage changes from the evolution process dominated by adsorption to the evolution process dominated by hydrodynamic dispersion as shown in path 4 b 4 in fig 3 the corresponding criterion is 15 m a x f r d and the corresponding critical condition is 16 r s r d if the fourth stage changes from the evolution process dominated by hydrodynamic dispersion to the evolution process dominated by adsorption as shown in path 4 a 4 in fig 3 the corresponding criterion is 17 m a x f r s and the corresponding critical condition is 18 r d r s if the fourth stage changes from advection dominated to adsorption dominated as shown in path 4 c 4 in fig 3 the corresponding criterion is 19 m a x f r s and the corresponding critical condition is 20 r a r s if the fourth stage changes from adsorption dominated to advection dominated as shown in path 4 d 4 in fig 3 the corresponding criterion is 21 m a x f r a and the corresponding critical condition is 22 r s r a the corresponding critical time associated with such a critical condition is denoted as tcr 3 4 3 mathematical model of flow and transport associated with low permeability lenses under the conceptual model described in section 1 the evolution process of contaminant removal in the low permeability lenses driven by gcws can be described by the following mathematical model 3 1 mathematical model of flow the movement of groundwater flow is described by the following governing equation jacob 1979 23 c s e s s h p t k h p d δ ij w p w i ρ w where c denotes specific moisture capacity 1 m s e is the effective saturation of soil dimensionless s s is the aquifer specific storage 1 m t is time k is the hydraulic conductivity m s the detailed information can be seen in section s2 in supporting materials h p is the pressure head m d is the elevation head m δ ij denotes the dirac delta function which is equal to 1 when it is at the injection and pumping sections of the well and equal to 0 when it is at the non injection and non pumping sections of the well ρ w is the water density kg m3 w p and w i are the masses of water pumped and injected into a unit volume of porous media kg m3 s the boundary and initial conditions are 24 n ρ w u γ u t 0 f u n ρ w u γ d t 0 f d n ρ w u γ l t 0 f l n ρ w u γ r t 0 f r h ω t 0 k 1 where n represents the unit normal vector perpendicular to the boundary γ u γ d γ l γ r represent the upper lower left and right boundaries respectively f u f d f l f r represent the discharge flux functions of the upper lower left and right boundaries respectively and k 1 represents the initial water head m 3 2 mathematical model of contaminant transport the advection dispersion equation is used to describe the transport process of solute in groundwater considering adsorption and biodegradation jacob 1979 and the governing equation is as follows 25 θ c t ρ s k p c t c p ρ p ε p t d d d e c u c k b c δ ij u c where θ represents the volume fraction of liquid dimensionless c p represents the concentration of contaminant adsorbed to solid phase mol kg ρ p represents the solid phase density of rock and soil mass kg m3 and is equal to ρ s 1 ε p ε p represents the porosity of matrix dimensionless the distribution coefficient k p adopts the linear isotherm adsorption model the dispersion coefficient d d adopts the two dimensional longitudinal and transverse diffusion model the effective diffusion coefficient d e adopts the millington quirk model the detailed information can be seen in section s3 in supporting materials the boundary and initial conditions of transport are 26 n j γ u t 0 y u n j γ d t 0 y d n j γ l t 0 y l n j γ r t 0 y r c ω t 0 k 2 where j represents the hydrodynamic dispersion flux mol m2 s y u y d y l and y r represent the concentration flux functions of the upper lower left and right boundaries respectively and k 2 represents the initial concentration mol m3 4 model settings in a rigorous sense the system of concern involves both saturated and unsaturated flow and transport process as a movable water table is presented the analytical modeling of this study approximates such a coupled saturated unsaturated flow into a simplified saturated flow and transport problem as done by most analytical modeling works concerning subsurface flow and transport by doing so the analytical work simplifies the unsaturated flow process using a properly defined water table condition the numerical modeling of this study however can actually simulate the integrated saturated and unsaturated flow and transport process one benefit of doing so is to check if the analytical modeling is a viable approach or not based on the conceptual model in section 1 fig 1 the injection pumping action of gcw will drive the groundwater circulation to form a three dimensional flow field with the wellbore as the central axis the lens is completely entrapped within the flow field the streamlines flowing near the surface of the lens will be bended around the lens because of the significant permeability contrast between the lens and the background aquifer and contaminants inside the lens will be transported to the aquifer through back diffusion and slow advection inside the lens after this the contaminants are transported to the pumping portion of the gcw and then pumped out for the purpose of illustration this study makes several assumptions regarding the geometry and position of the lens for a finite volume lens with irregular boundaries the flow field near the lens can be very complex thus to simplify the numerical simulation and illustration of results we have adopted a two dimensional 2d cross sectional surrogate model to represent the simplified three dimensional 3d model as shown in fig 4 in this 2d model the lens has a rectangle shape with the upper and lower sides parallel with the base of the aquifer if viewed from a 3d perspective the rectangle lens in the 2d model can be regarded as a sufficiently long lens along the y direction perpendicular to the xz plane in fig 4 or the extended lens and the circulation well is not a line source but a planar source or the so called extended well with a sufficient length along the y axis the sufficient lengths for the extended lens and extended well mean that those lengths are greater than the scale of influence caused by the pumping and injection operation of the circulation well we must point out that this 2d model is different from the actual 3d model when the lens is a finite volume near a circulation well depicted as a vertical line source despite such a difference the simplified 2d model help us gain the necessary insights into the problem which are helpful for understanding the complex 3d model in the future as shown in fig 4 the rectangular domain of concern is 11 m high and extends indefinitely in the horizontal direction take 10 m wide for simulation the rest is replaced by an infinite element which permits a lateral boundary condition that is sufficiently far from the rectangle domain of concern the gcw is located on the left boundary of the domain the right boundary is set to the right of the infinite element the low permeability lens is located on the right side of the gcw with its left boundary 1 m away from the left side of the domain and its upper boundary 5 5 m below the surface the rectangular lens is 0 5 m high and 2 m wide there is no rainfall and evaporation on the surface of the rectangular site the initial water table is located 1 m below the surface and the bottom of the aquifer is bounded by an aquifuge which is impermeable to flow and transport water is injected at a point 2 m below the surface from gcw the left boundary of domain in fig 4 and pumped out at a point 10 5 m below the surface it is notable that in this study the injection and pumping are treated as point source and sink respectively if injection and pumping are conducted over finite lengths then the injection and pumping should be treated as line source and sink respectively the high permeability aquifer or the low permeability lens itself is homogeneous and isotropic if vertical anisotropy exists one can use properly rescaled horizontal and vertical coordinates to convert the anisotropic aquifer into an isotropic aquifer thus vertical anisotropy is not specifically discussed here the initial contaminant concentration profile contains 0 02 mol m3 of otc within the low permeability lens and zero concentrations of otc outside the low permeability lens this of course is a simplified version of reality in which both the lens and background aquifer may contain non zero but different contaminant concentrations this simplification is for the purpose of illustration and it will not alter the primary conclusions of the work the relevant parameters involved in the flow and transport processes of the aquifer and lens have been used before in other studies and are shown in tables 2 and 3 yu 2017 comsol bortone et al 2020 bortone et al 2019 hydrus yu et al 2022 pan et al 2021 femwater lin et al 2017 vats et al 2020 and feflow kouamé et al 2019 huang et al 2020a huang et al 2020b are all finite element numerical simulation software that can simulate flow and transport in porous media the comsol simulation exercises in this paper serves the following purposes 1 comsol honors all the physical conditions and processes relevant in the analytical framework 2 comsol is a software package in which one can specify the expressions of constitutive equations governing partial differential equations and boundary conditions to solve 3 comsol is highly accurate with the adaptive mesh partitioning technology which provides two kinds of solutions for users to choose separation and full coupling li et al 2021 in this study comsol multiphysics is used to simulate the groundwater flow and contaminant transport processes in the study area the detailed information on mesh generation possible numerical errors associated with discretization as well as techniques to minimize numerical dispersion and numerical oscillation problems can be seen in section s8 in supporting materials it can be seen from section 1 1 that the evolution path with different stages dominated by biodegradation in the first stage is similar to the evolution path with different stages dominated by adsorption in the first stage as shown in fig 3 therefore the following simulation will take the evolution process dominated by adsorption as an example to capture the evolution paths with different evolution stages there are 11 evolutionary paths in the first stage which is dominated by adsorption as an example this study only shows one evolutionary path in each of the four evolutionary stages totaling four evolutionary paths to explain the essence of the problem the specific working condition settings are shown in table 3 5 results and discussion 5 1 results fig 5 shows the simulation results captured under the working condition one stage evolutionary path 1 set in table 3 to verify the one stage evolutionary path dominated by the first stage adsorption about 1300 days the four removal factors reached the complete removal stage as shown in fig 5 a until the completion of remediation during the whole remediation period max f rs so the adsorption is always dominant in the process of contaminant removal until the contaminant are completely removed it can be seen from fig 5 b that after the gcw starts to operate the contaminant removal rates driven by advection adsorption and biodegradation are in the initial stage within 7 min and the contaminant removal rate driven by hydrodynamic dispersion is in the initial stage within 12 min and after the initial stage the evolution process of each factor follows the evolution law described in section 1 the removal rate of contaminant driven by adsorption which is the dominant factor reaches the peak in the rising stage at 2 2 d and then the removal rate of contaminant driven by adsorption enters the falling stage fig 6 shows the simulation results captured under the working condition two stage evolutionary path 2 a set in table 3 to verify the two stage evolutionary path dominated by the first stage adsorption about 70 days the four removal factors reached the complete removal stage as shown in fig 6 a in the whole remediation period max f rs from the beginning of the gcw operation to 0 01 days adsorption is dominant in the process of contaminant removal the critical time tcr 1 2 for the transition from adsorption removal to advective removal is 0 01 d after this critical time one has max f ra and the advective removal factor dominates until the contaminant is completely removed it can be seen from fig 6 b that when gcw starts to operate the contaminant removal rates of the four removal factors are in the initial stage within 7 min after the initial stage the evolution process of each factor follows the evolution law described in section 1 the evolution of adsorption removal efficiency with time reaches the peak at 1 3 d and the evolution of advection removal efficiency with time reaches the peak at 1 1 d and then both of them enter the falling stage fig 7 shows the simulation results captured under the working condition three stage evolutionary path 3 b set in table 3 to verify the three stage evolutionary path dominated by the first stage adsorption about 1250 days the four removal factors reached the complete removal stage as shown in fig 7 a in the whole remediation period max f rs from the start of gcw operation to 0 7 d and the adsorption removal is dominant in the process of contaminant removal the critical time tcr 1 2 for the transition from adsorption removal to advective removal is 0 7 d after this critical time one has max f ra and advection is the dominant factor in the process of contaminant removal the critical time tcr 2 3 for the transition from advective removal to adsorption removal is 42 5 d after that max f rs adsorption becomes dominant again until the contaminant is completely removed it can be seen from fig 7 b that after the gcw starts to operate the contaminant removal rates driven by advection adsorption and biodegradation are in the initial stage within 7 min and the contaminant removal rate driven by hydrodynamic dispersion is in the initial stage within 12 min after the initial stage the evolution process of each factor follows the evolution law described in section 1 the evolution of adsorption removal efficiency with time reaches the peak at 1 4 days and the evolution of advection removal efficiency with time reaches the peak at 1 2 days and then both of them enter the falling stage fig 8 shows the simulation results captured under the working condition four stage evolutionary path 4 c set in table 3 to verify the four stage evolutionary path dominated by the first stage adsorption about 1350 days the four removal factors reached the complete removal stage as shown in fig 8 a in the whole remediation period max f rs from the beginning of the gcw operation to 0 8 d and the adsorption removal factor is dominant in the process of contaminant removal the critical time tcr 1 2 for the transition from adsorption removal to hydrodynamic dispersion removal is 0 8 d after which max f rd and hydrodynamic dispersion removal is dominant the critical time tcr 2 3 for the transition from the dominant hydrodynamic dispersion removal to the dominant advective removal is 1 31 d after which max f ra and the advective removal is dominant the critical time tcr 3 4 for the change from the dominant advective removal to the dominant adsorption removal is 100 d after which max f rs and the adsorption removal factor dominates again until the contaminant is completely removed it can be seen from fig 8 b that after the gcw starts to operate the removal rates of contaminant driven by advection and biodegradation are in the initial stage within 7 min and the removal rates of contaminant driven by hydrodynamic dispersion and adsorption are in the initial stage within 15 min after the initial stage the evolution process of each factor follows the evolution law described in section 1 the evolution of adsorption removal efficiency with time reaches the peak at 5 days in the rising stage and the evolution of hydrodynamic dispersion removal efficiency with time reaches the peak at 2 2 days in the rising stage and the evolution of advective removal efficiency with times reaches the peak at 2 days in the rising stage after that the three removal processes all enter the falling stage fig 9 shows the curve of the average concentration cheng et al 2022 of otc in the lens with time under the four evolution path conditions set in table 3 as can be seen from fig 9 the time for otc to be completely removed in the lens is as follows one stage evolutionary path 1 about 1300 days two stage evolutionary path 2 a about 70 days three stage evolutionary path 3 b about 1250 days and four stage evolutionary path 4 c about 1350 days which is consistent with the time when the four removal factors in the above mentioned evolution path reach the complete removal stage because the second stage of two stage evolutionary path 2 a is dominated by advection and the existence of gcw strengthens the advection through the low permeability lens thus when the evolution path is two stage evolutionary path 2 a the gcw can remediate the low permeability lens in the shortest time 5 2 parameter sensitivity analysis to further discuss the influence of hydrodynamic conditions and solute transport conditions on the evolution characteristics of the remediation process of secondary contaminant sources in low permeability lens driven by gcw a single factor sensitivity analysis is carried out on its parameters brunner et al 2009 the concerned parameters are the location of the injection point and pumping point of gcw the horizontal distance between the wellbore and the lens the rate of injection pumping used in gcw the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer and lens the adsorption coefficient inside lens the biodegradation coefficient inside lens the diffusion coefficient of contaminant inside and outside the lens and the longitudinal dispersivity in the lens and aquifer it should be noted that sensitivity analysis of transverse dispersivity are not discussed in the paper as longitudinal dispersivity usually exceeds transverse dispersivity by one to two orders of magnitude with a total of 12 parameters each parameter is set at five different levels and for specific parameter settings one can see table 4 and table 5 for details the detailed information can be seen in section s9 in supporting materials to present the influence of hydrodynamic parameters and solute transport parameters on the critical time in a concise and clear way we adopted a min max normalization method sinsomboonthong 2022 to process the data and the specific formula is as follows 27 x x min x max x min x where x represents the result of parameters normalization x represents the original parameters 5 2 1 sensitivity analysis of hydrodynamic parameters 5 2 1 1 influence of hydrodynamic parameters on evolution stage table 4 shows the effect of six hydrodynamic parameters on the evolution stage that taking the three stage evolutionary path 3 b as an example it can be seen from table 4 that as the height of the water injection point decreases the height of the water pumping point increases the horizontal distance between the wellbore and the lens increases and the rate of injection pumping of gcw decreases the evolution stage of contaminant remediation evolves from the three stage evolution path to the one stage evolution path the change of the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer or lens does not lead to the evolution of the remediation path within the range of variation of each parameter discussed above the adsorption removal factor is dominant in the first stage of the following one stage two stage and three stage evolutionary paths the advection removal factor is dominant in the second stage of the two stage and the three stage evolutionary paths the adsorption removal factor is dominant in the third stage of the three stage evolution path the detailed information can be seen in section s4 in supporting materials 5 2 1 2 influence of hydrodynamic parameters on critical moment fig 10 shows the effect of six hydrodynamic parameters on tcr1 2 and tcr2 3 using the three stage evolutionary path 3 b set in table 4 as an example fig 10 a shows the effect of each hydraulic parameter on tcr 1 2 and one can see that tcr 1 2 has a linear negative correlation with the saturated hydraulic conductivity inside the lens a nonlinear positive correlation with the injection height and the horizontal distance between the wellbore and the lens a nonlinear negative correlation with the pumping height and injection pumping rate and a no correlation with the saturated hydraulic conductivity outside the lens the detailed information can be seen in section s5 1 in supporting materials fig 10 b shows the effect of each hydraulic parameter on tcr 2 3 as shown in fig 10 b tcr 2 3 is linear negative related to the saturated hydraulic conductivity inside the lens nonlinear positive related to the height of the pumping point the injection pumping rate and the saturated hydraulic conductivity outside the lens and nonlinear negative related to the height of the injection point and the horizontal distance between the wellbore and the lens the detailed information can be seen in section s5 2 in supporting materials 5 2 2 sensitivity analysis of solute transport parameters 5 2 2 1 influence of solute transport parameters on evolution stage table 5 shows the effect of six solute transport parameters on the evolution stage using the three stage evolutionary path 3 b as an example it can be seen from table 5 that with the increase of biodegradation coefficient of the lens the evolution stage of contaminant remediation evolves from the three stage evolution path to the one stage evolution path and the adsorption coefficient longitudinal dispersion inside and outside the lens and diffusion coefficient of contaminant inside and outside the lens do not lead to the evolution of the evolution path of contaminant remediation under the variation of each parameter the adsorption removal factor is dominant in the first stage of the one stage evolution path and the three stage evolution path the advection removal factor is dominant in the second stage of the three stage evolution path and the adsorption removal factor is dominant in the third stage the detailed information can be seen in section s6 in supporting materials 5 2 2 2 influence of solute transport parameters on critical moment fig 11 shows the effect of six solute transport parameters on tcr1 2 and tcr2 3 using the three stage evolutionary path 3 b set in table 5 as an example fig 11 a shows the effect of each solute transport parameter on tcr 1 2 as shown in fig 11 a tcr 1 2 is linear positive correlated with the biodegradation coefficient in the lens the longitudinal dispersivity inside the lens and the diffusion coefficient of contaminant inside and outside the lens is linear negative correlation with the longitudinal dispersion outside the lens and is nonlinear positive correlated with the adsorption coefficient in the lens the detailed information can be seen in section s7 1 in supporting materials fig 11 b shows the effect of each solute transport parameter on tcr 2 3 as shown in fig 11 b tcr 2 3 has a linear positive correlation with the longitudinal dispersivity inside and outside the lens and the diffusion coefficient of contaminant inside the lens has a linear negative correlation with the diffusion coefficient of contaminant outside the lens and has a nonlinear negative correlation with the adsorption coefficient and biodegradation coefficient in the lens the detailed information can be seen in section s7 2 in supporting materials 5 3 the innovations and limitations of the study in this paper an idealized physical model is used to construct a theoretical framework for the remediation of contaminant evolution in a low permeability lens in an aquifer by a gcw the low permeability lens in the study area is located in a homogeneously saturated aquifer the geometry of the lens is rectangular and the water circulation is driven by pumping and injection from gcw without other source sink terms to simplify the analysis of the contaminant evolution process only a single contaminant lens is considered and only transport processes of advection hydrodynamic dispersion adsorption and biodegradation were considered under the above conditions the innovative contributions of this study can be briefly summarized as follows first four mechanisms of contaminant removal in low permeability lens driven by a gcw have been explored second a theoretical framework has been constructed to describe the remediation process in low permeability lens driven by a gcw third the evolution path of the contaminant removal process in the low permeability lens has been explored the evolution stages are divided and the critical state and critical conditions of the transformation between the evolution stages are defined fourth the effects of hydrodynamic parameters and solute transport parameters on the remediation process are analyzed and prioritized based on this study it can be seen that the essence of contaminant removal in the lens driven by the gcw involves the change of dominating roles played by different driving factors to stimulating the transition of the evolutionary path in the system the established theoretical framework of evolution paths in this study can help us understand the relationship between the contaminant removal paths the transition of paths and the contaminants removal process under different driving factors this will guide us to explore how to adjust the driving factors through engineering measures so as to achieve the purpose of improving the contaminants remediation efficiency involving the contaminated low permeability lens to further explore the mechanism of gcw remediation of contaminant in the low permeability lens in the aquifer the following points need to be explored in future research first compared with equilibrium adsorption the adsorption rate in non equilibrium adsorption is usually greater or less than desorption rate zhao et al 2007 for the non equilibrium adsorption with greater adsorption rate than desorption rate the solid phase adsorption rate is faster than the equilibrium adsorption rate otherwise it is slower therefore the effects of equilibrium adsorption and non equilibrium adsorption on the removal rate of pollutants driven by adsorption are different this difference will lead to changes in the duration and start and end time of the pollution removal stage dominated by adsorption in the evolution path of pollution removal thus the specific evolutionary path changes the influence of equilibrium adsorption and non equilibrium adsorption on the evolutionary path will be discussed in the future second the biodegradation includes aerobic biodegradation anoxic biodegradation and anaerobic biodegradation otc can be biodegraded in aerobic anoxic and anaerobic reactions yang 2010 in this paper the differences among aerobic anoxic and anaerobic pairs of evolutionary paths are not specified in details further exploration of this issue will be carried out in the future third in this paper the 2d cross sectional model is used to simplify the 3d flow field in the conceptual model although the 2d model provides very useful insights into the problem one must conduct a 3d model to understand the actual performance of gcw for realistic remediation process involving a finite volume 3d lens with possibly irregular shape fourth an idealized homogeneous aquifer is used in the model setting in this paper but in the actual remediation of contaminated sites the aquifer outside of the low permeability lens is mostly heterogeneous furthermore multiple lenses may be randomly distributed in the aquifer in subsequent studies the influence of aquifer heterogeneity the irregularity of lens geometry and the randomness of lenses distribution and the existence of unsaturated zones on the evolution process will be further explored 6 summary and conclusions in this study the remediation process of secondary contaminant sources in low permeability lens driven by gcw is taken as the research object the mechanism of contaminant removal process in low permeability lens is explored and the theoretical framework for describing the contaminant removal process in low permeable lens driven by gcw is constructed in the theoretical framework developed in this study the evolution process of contaminant removal rate in low permeability lens is summarized the evolution stages are divided and the critical state and critical condition are defined the numerical simulation method is used to test the developed theoretical framework and the parameter sensitivity analysis is used to reveal the influence of different contaminant removal factors on the contaminant removal process in the low permeability lens the specific

by advection hydrodynamic dispersion and adsorption includes four stages namely an initial stage a rising stage a falling stage and a complete removal stage the evolution process of contaminant removal driven by biodegradation includes three stages namely an initial stage a falling stage and a complete removal stage the evolution paths of contaminant removal dominated by adsorption or biodegradation in the first stage are discussed and the evolution paths are divided into four categories namely the one stage two stage three stage and four stage evolution paths totaling 22 evolution paths and according to different dominant factors in the evolutionary path the conditions of evolutionary stages transition called the critical conditions are established and four evolutionary stages dominated by advection hydrodynamic dispersion adsorption or biodegradation are defined the critical state and critical condition are defined according to the relative relationship of contaminant removal rate in each evolution stage by setting a single gcw to remediate a rectangular low permeability secondary contaminant source in a 2d cross sectional view and adjusting its hydrodynamic parameters and solute transport parameters the evolution paths of the one stage two stage three stage and four stage are captured in which the first stage is dominated by adsorption the theoretical framework is verified through the single factor sensitivity analysis the influence of hydrodynamic parameters on the evolution process is as follows with the height of injection point from high to low the height of pumping point from low to high the horizontal distance between wellbore and lens from small to large and the injection pumping rate from large to small the evolution path of contaminant remediation evolves from three stage evolution path to one stage evolution path and the variation of the saturated hydraulic conductivities inside and outside the lens do not lead to the evolution of the remediation path the effect on the critical time is as follows tcr 1 2 is positively related to the height of the injection point and the horizontal distance between the wellbore and the lens is negatively related to the saturated hydraulic conductivity inside the lens the height of the pumping point and the injection pumping rate and it is no correlation with the saturated hydraulic

contaminated sites has long been one of the main environmental concerns by the general public and environmental professionals naseri rad et al 2020 wang et al 2021 despite decades of contaminated site remediation persistent groundwater contaminant plumes higher than contaminant concentration limits are often found after active remediation closure adamson et al 2016 wanner et al 2018 this phenomenon is largely attributed to a process known as back diffusion and it is due to the reversal of the concentration gradient between the higher permeable region and the lower permeable region and the transfer of solute from the lower permeability region back to the higher permeability region atteia et al 2005 parker and kim 2015 after the completion of primary remediation of groundwater contaminated sites low permeability lenses often act as secondary contaminant sources and release contaminant through back diffusion resulting in rebound of concentration of contaminant of concern in the permeable region parker et al 2008 sale et al 2008 removal of contaminant in low permeability regions of persistent secondary contaminant sources is one of the major challenges of groundwater remediation liu and ball 2002 chapman and parker 2005 yan et al 2016 therefore it is of great significance to carry out theoretical and experimental research on remediation of low permeability secondary contaminant sources to tackle this grand challenge that has haunted environmental professionals for such a long time the first attempt of understanding groundwater remediation of low permeability media can be traced back to the concept of non fickian transport in the 1980s and the subsequent rise of the stochastic hydrology theory of non fickian transport which deviates substantially from the traditional fickian transport and brownian motion theory in homogeneous media guo et al 2021 from a theoretical perspective difficulties of understanding contaminant remediation in low permeability lenses are as follows first the permeability contrast between the low permeability lenses and the background permeable aquifer could lead to the so called preferential flow in high permeability region and circumfluence flow in low permeability lenses conrad et al 2002 mulligan and wang 2006 hayden et al 2006 dermont et al 2008 zhong et al 2011 west and kueper 2012 hao et al 2013 qiao et al 2015 zhao et al 2018 second the flow rates in the low permeability lenses are significantly smaller than those in the background permeable aquifer making it difficult for contaminant trapped in low permeability lenses to migrate out of the lenses huang et al 2020a huang et al 2020b ren et al 2021 third the soil particles in the low permeability lenses have large specific surface areas thus have strong adsorption effects on contaminants semer and reddy 1996 kuhlman and greenfield 1999 song et al 2016 cui 2019 considering above mentioned factors numerous studies have proposed many in situ methods to improve the remediation efficiency when low permeability lenses are presented for example multiphase displacement method corredor et al 2019 electrokinetic remediation method ma et al 2007 freeze thaw method rui et al 2019 and groundwater circulation wells gcws have been applied this study will focus on the remediation technology associated with gcws which refer to vertical circulation wells vcws only meaning that other types of circulation wells such as horizontal circulation wells will not be covered gcws are widely used in groundwater remediation and is based on the improvements of air sparging and pump and treat technology pu et al 2021 a traditional gcw system consists of an injection well screen segment and a pumping well screen segment in the same wellbore while these screen segments are separated vertically with a certain section of casing the choice of the separation distance between the injection and pumping segments depends on several factors such as the size of the contaminant plume the permeability of the aquifer and anisotropy of the aquifer etc kabala 1993 proposed the dipole flow test dft which separated a gcw into two chambers groundwater was pumped from the pumping chamber at the same rate as that injected into the injection chamber forming a three dimensional circulating dipole flow field xiang and kabala 1997 proposed a dft model for layered heterogeneous aquifers or aquifers with circulating wells on the basis of kabala 1993 model for a single layer homogeneous aquifer halihan and zlotnik 2002 established the drawdown expression with asymmetric flow field when the injection and pumping screen sections have different lengths to expand the applicability of the dft model sutton et al 2000 studied contaminant transport process driven by gcw for the first time by using a dipole flow test with a tracer dftt in addition dftt was also used to study contaminant transport processes in aquifers driven by tandem circulation well tcw where tcw is a pair of dipole wells with one dipole pumping water through the lower screen and injecting water through the upper screen and the other dipole well pumping water through the upper screen and injecting water through the lower section goltz et al 2008 carried out a study on solute transport based on dftt in tcw dftt has also been termed with different names such as the injection withdrawal test in novakowski et al 2004 the well to well tracer test in luo et al 2007 and the doublet test in zech et al 2018 meanwhile reiha 2007 analyzed the solute transport process of the dipole flow reactive tracer test dfrtt based on the finite volume method in recent years a series of derivative technologies associated with gcws have been developed by integrating physical chemical and biological processes such as novocs circulation wells allmon et al 1999 uvb circulation wells simon et al 1995 and ddc circulation wells schrauf 1996 which have shown various degrees of success in improving the remediation efficiency with the further development of technology johnson and simon 2007 noted that gcws can increase vertical groundwater flow through low permeability lenses thus flushing out contaminant that cannot be reached by a conventional vertical remediation well in which horizontal groundwater flow prevails tatti et al 2018 studied the back diffusion process of contaminant from low permeability lenses to the high permeability aquifer using sandbox experiments and image analysis techniques and demonstrated the necessity of using gcws to replace inefficient vertical pumping wells tatti et al 2019 carried out experimental and numerical evaluation of gcws in the source area of persistent low permeability contaminant and stated that gcws system was more suitable for remediation of low permeability aquifer contaminant than pump and treat technology paolo et al 2019 showed that gcws can extract groundwater from extremely low permeability layers strengthen the mobilization of contaminant from inaccessible areas and effectively mobilize contaminant captured or adsorbed in low permeability layers although previous studies have shown that using gcws to remediate low permeability aquifer is an effective technology there are several critical issues that have not been addressed and need our attention to advance the remediation technology of gcws for instance the theoretical mechanism of gcws to remediate secondary groundwater contaminant sources associated with low permeability lenses is unclear the evolution stages of remediation in low permeable lenses associated with gcws have not been fully quantified a quantitative method to evaluate the influence of flow and transport conditions on the remediation process of low permeable layers using gcws is not available in recent years the subsurface contamination caused by tetracycline antibiotics has attracted the attention of a large number of scholars peterson et al 2012 huang et al 2020a huang et al 2020b oxytetracycline otc is one of the most common and widely used antibiotics among tetracycline due to its broad activity and low cost zge et al 2014 studies have found that otc has potential toxicity carcinogenicity mutagenicity and endocrine interference zhang et al 2021 which can change the composition of microbial community in the subsurface environment and induce the generation of drug resistance genes in microorganisms thus significantly reduces the ability to treat bacterial infections malmqvist and munthe 2020 grgić et al 2021 when animals are fed with tetracycline antibiotics 60 90 of the applied antibiotics is discharged into the soil and water environment in the original form or metabolite halling sørensen et al 1998 due to the low degradation of otc blackwell et al 2005 causing groundwater pollution therefore remediation of otc contaminated groundwater is one of the major environmental concerns in recent years li et al 2021 in view of the above situation this study takes otc as a representative contaminant to illustrate the use of gcws to remediation otc in low permeability lenses this study employs the comsol program to establish a finite element numerical model for remediation of contaminant sources in low permeability regions by gcws considering biodegradation and adsorption the evolution process of contaminant removal rate in the low permeable lenses will be analyzed and several critical states and critical conditions associated with such an evolution process will be quantified for the first time finally the parameter sensitivity analysis is conducted for the system of concern this study is expected to provide a theoretical reference for gcws application of groundwater remediation associated with low permeability lenses in a contaminated aquifer 2 evolution process of contaminant removal in lenses and associated critical conditions to facilitate the description the study area contains a low permeability lens which is regarded as a secondary contaminant region as shown in fig 1 the lithologic characteristics of the system of concern is as follows a low permeability lens is located at certain depth below the surface in a homogeneous aquifer the gcw is the only driving force of hydrodynamic condition at the site without any background regional flow the lateral boundary conditions of flow are sufficiently far to have negligible influence on the operation of gcw and precipitation and evaporation are not presented the base of the aquifer is impermeable during the operation of gcw the rate of pumping and rate of injection are the same the whole system is hydrostatic before the operation of gcw and the water table is located at a certain depth below the surface the contaminant is assumed to exist uniformly in the porewater of low permeability lens in which adsorption and biodegradation of contaminant can occur for the purpose of demonstration the adsorption is assumed to be equilibrium following a linear isotherm and the biodegradation follows an exponentially decayed function of time the adsorption and biodegradation outside the lens are considered to be secondary effects which are not considered other than the contaminant sources in the low permeability lens there are no other contaminant sources or sinks it is also assumed that the extracted contaminant in the pumped water is completely removed before the water is injected back into the aquifer under the above assumptions contaminant removal factors in the lens include advection hydrodynamic dispersion biodegradation and adsorption among them advection as shown in the red curve in fig 2 hydrodynamic dispersion as shown in the green curve in fig 2 and adsorption as shown in the orange curve in fig 2 are the three driving factors of contaminant removal and the evolution process contains four stages namely an initial stage a rising stage a falling stage and a complete removal stage the evolution process of contaminant removal driven by biodegradation as shown in the blue curve in fig 2 includes three stages namely an initial stage a falling stage and a complete removal stage the detailed information can be seen in section s1 in supporting materials 2 1 evolution process of contaminant removal in different periods of gcw operation the relative magnitude of the four removal factors changes with time as shown in fig 2 during a certain period of operation there is always one removal factor that is the maximum among the four factors and this removal factor is called the dominant removal factors in this period further it is assumed that the molecular diffusion is far less than that of adsorption or biodegradation under the influence of the above mentioned multiple removal mechanisms the dominating removal factors are different in different periods of gcw operation and the evolution process is divided into four types namely the one stage evolution process the dominant role does not change the two stage evolution process the dominant role changes once the three stage evolution process the dominant role changes twice and the four stage evolution process the dominant role changes three times overall there are 22 evolutionary paths in total as shown in fig 3 in the evolution process the removal rate of contaminant in the lens driven by adsorption is either greater than or lower than that driven by biodegradation but the molecular diffusion is usually far less than those of adsorption or biodegradation when the gcw starts to operate if groundwater flow has not yet reached the lens the removal of contaminant by advection and mechanical dispersion does not exist therefore at the early phase of gcw operation there may be two dominant roles namely adsorption and biodegradation when the removal of contaminant by adsorption is stronger than that by biodegradation in the early phase of gcw operation there are two possible evolutions of contaminant removal when the contaminant removal rate driven by advection or hydrodynamic dispersion is weaker than that driven by adsorption the adsorption removal factor is dominant until the completion of remediation as shown in path 1 1 in fig 3 which is the one stage evolution process when the contaminant removal rate driven by advection or hydrodynamic dispersion is stronger than that driven by adsorption there will be two stages three stages and four stage evolution processes this will be discussed in the next paragraph otherwise when the removal of contaminant by biodegradation is stronger than that by adsorption in the early phase of gcw operation and biodegradation is always stronger than advection or hydrodynamic dispersion during the operation of the gcw it is another one stage evolution process dominated by biodegradation as shown in path a 1 in fig 3 for the evolution process with two stages three stages and four stages the first stage is either dominated by biodegradation if biodegradation is stronger than adsorption or by adsorption if adsorption is stronger than biodegradation for the evolutionary process with different stages dominated by biodegradation in the first stage its evolutionary path is similar to that with different stages dominated by adsorption in the first stage as shown in fig 3 therefore the following discussion will take the evolution process dominated by adsorption in the first stage as an example to illustrate the evolution process with different following stages when the contaminant removal driven by advection or hydrodynamic dispersion is stronger than that driven by adsorption the dominant role of adsorption in the process of contaminant removal will be changed to that driven by advection or hydrodynamic dispersion as shown in path 2 a 2 or path 2 b 2 in fig 3 this stage is called the evolution state of contaminant removal dominated by advection or hydrodynamic dispersion as the removal process driven by gcws continues the concentration of contaminants in the lens continues to decrease and the rate of contaminant removal by advection or hydrodynamic dispersion will also change at this time if the removal of contaminant driven by advection is always stronger than that driven by adsorption and hydrodynamic dispersion the removal of contaminant driven by advection will always play a dominant role until the completion of remediation and the evolution process will maintain path 2 a 2 which is the two stage evolution process or if the removal of contaminant driven by hydrodynamic dispersion is always stronger than that driven by adsorption and advection then the removal of contaminant driven by hydrodynamic dispersion will always play a dominant role until the completion of remediation and the evolution process will maintain in path 2 b 2 so the evolution process is also the two stage evolution process when the second stage of the evolution path is dominated by advection if the removal of contaminant driven by adsorption or hydrodynamic dispersion is stronger than that by advection the evolution path will change to path 3 b 3 or path 3 a 3 the stage of contaminant removal dominated by adsorption or hydrodynamic dispersion if the removal of contaminant driven by adsorption or hydrodynamic dispersion is always stronger than that by advection the removal of contaminant driven by adsorption or hydrodynamic dispersion will always play a dominant role until the completion of remediation and the evolution path remains in path 3 b 3 or path 3 a 3 which is the three stage evolution process when the second stage of the evolution path is dominated by hydrodynamic dispersion and if the third stage is dominated by advection or adsorption the evolution process is also the three stage evolution process as shown in path 3 c 3 or path 3 d 3 otherwise there will be a fourth evolution stage in the evolution path and the dominant role of this stage depends on the relative strength of each dominant factor of contaminant removal in the third stage as shown in path 4 a 4 4 b 4 or path 4 c 4 4 d 4 2 2 critical conditions of contaminant removal rate because the contaminant removal rates of the four factors are different this study calls the state corresponding to the contaminant removal rate that is about to exceed the dominant factor at this stage as the critical state this study also defines the state when the removal rates of the two factors are equal as the corresponding critical condition and the time associated with the critical condition is called the critical time according to the evolution process of contaminant removal rate in the lens there are multiple evolution states in the process of contaminant removal and different evolution states have different critical state the criteria of different evolution stages and the corresponding critical conditions are expressed as follows taking the evolution process dominated by adsorption in the first stage as an example to illustrate the critical conditions of the evolution process and the results are summarized in table 1 in the early phase of gcw operation if the removal effect of contaminant under adsorption is stronger than that under biodegradation namely 1 r s r b where r s π ρ s k p c t d π r b π 1 k b c t d π ρ s represents the mineral density of lens kg m3 k p represents the distribution coefficient m3 kg c represents the concentration of aqueous phase contaminant mol m3 k b represents the microbial degradation coefficient of contaminant 1 s π represents the volume of concern at this time corresponding to the first stage evolution process dominated by adsorption there may be one stage two stage three stage and four stage evolution paths as shown in table 1 if adsorption always plays a dominant role in the process of evolution namely 2 m a x f r s where f rs rb rd ra and f is the vector of element including the contaminant removal rate driven by adsorption rs biodegradation rb hydrodynamic dispersion rd and advection ra then the corresponding evolution path is one stage as shown by path 1 1 in fig 3 in the two stage three stage and four stage evolution paths if the second stage is transformed into an evolution process dominated by advection as shown in paths 2 a 2 3 a 2 3 b 2 4 a 2 4 b 2 in fig 3 the corresponding criterion is 3 m a x f r a where r a u ω c d ω in which u represents the darcy velocity m s is a vector and ω represents the area of concern the corresponding critical condition is 4 r s r a if the second stage is transformed into an evolution process dominated by hydrodynamic dispersion as shown by paths 2 b 2 3 c 2 3 d 2 4 c 2 and 4 d 2 in fig 3 the corresponding criterion is 5 m a x f r d where r d j ω d ω in which j represents the hydrodynamic dispersion flux mol m2 s and it equal d d d e c d d represents the dispersion coefficient of the contaminant m2 s which is a second order tensor and d e represents the effective molecular diffusion coefficient of the contaminant m2 s which is a second order tensor as well the detailed information can be seen in section s3 in supporting materials the corresponding critical condition is 6 r s r d the corresponding critical time associated with such a critical condition is denoted as tcr 1 2 if the second stage continues until the contaminant is completely removed the evolution path is the two stage evolution path otherwise there may be the three stage or four stage evolution path in the three stage and four stage evolution paths if the third stage changes from advection dominated to adsorption dominated as shown in path 3 b 3 and 4 b 3 in fig 3 the corresponding criterion is 7 m a x f r s and the corresponding critical condition is 8 r a r s if the third stage changes from advection dominated to hydrodynamic dispersion dominated as shown in path 3 a 3 and 4 a 3 in fig 3 the corresponding criterion is 9 m a x f r d and the corresponding critical condition is 10 r a r d in the three stage and four stage evolution paths if the third stage changes from the evolution process dominated by hydrodynamic dispersion to the evolution process dominated by adsorption as shown in path 3 d 3 and 4 d 3 in fig 3 the corresponding criterion is 11 m a x f r s and the corresponding critical condition is 12 r d r s if the third stage changes from the evolution dominated by hydrodynamic dispersion to the evolution dominated by advection as shown in path 3 c 3 and 4 c 3 in fig 3 the corresponding criterion is 13 m a x f r a and the corresponding critical condition is 14 r d r a the corresponding critical time associated with such a critical condition is denoted as tcr 2 3 if the third stage continues until the contaminant is completely removed the evolution path is the three stage evolution path otherwise the four stage evolution path may occur in the four stage evolution path if the fourth stage changes from the evolution process dominated by adsorption to the evolution process dominated by hydrodynamic dispersion as shown in path 4 b 4 in fig 3 the corresponding criterion is 15 m a x f r d and the corresponding critical condition is 16 r s r d if the fourth stage changes from the evolution process dominated by hydrodynamic dispersion to the evolution process dominated by adsorption as shown in path 4 a 4 in fig 3 the corresponding criterion is 17 m a x f r s and the corresponding critical condition is 18 r d r s if the fourth stage changes from advection dominated to adsorption dominated as shown in path 4 c 4 in fig 3 the corresponding criterion is 19 m a x f r s and the corresponding critical condition is 20 r a r s if the fourth stage changes from adsorption dominated to advection dominated as shown in path 4 d 4 in fig 3 the corresponding criterion is 21 m a x f r a and the corresponding critical condition is 22 r s r a the corresponding critical time associated with such a critical condition is denoted as tcr 3 4 3 mathematical model of flow and transport associated with low permeability lenses under the conceptual model described in section 1 the evolution process of contaminant removal in the low permeability lenses driven by gcws can be described by the following mathematical model 3 1 mathematical model of flow the movement of groundwater flow is described by the following governing equation jacob 1979 23 c s e s s h p t k h p d δ ij w p w i ρ w where c denotes specific moisture capacity 1 m s e is the effective saturation of soil dimensionless s s is the aquifer specific storage 1 m t is time k is the hydraulic conductivity m s the detailed information can be seen in section s2 in supporting materials h p is the pressure head m d is the elevation head m δ ij denotes the dirac delta function which is equal to 1 when it is at the injection and pumping sections of the well and equal to 0 when it is at the non injection and non pumping sections of the well ρ w is the water density kg m3 w p and w i are the masses of water pumped and injected into a unit volume of porous media kg m3 s the boundary and initial conditions are 24 n ρ w u γ u t 0 f u n ρ w u γ d t 0 f d n ρ w u γ l t 0 f l n ρ w u γ r t 0 f r h ω t 0 k 1 where n represents the unit normal vector perpendicular to the boundary γ u γ d γ l γ r represent the upper lower left and right boundaries respectively f u f d f l f r represent the discharge flux functions of the upper lower left and right boundaries respectively and k 1 represents the initial water head m 3 2 mathematical model of contaminant transport the advection dispersion equation is used to describe the transport process of solute in groundwater considering adsorption and biodegradation jacob 1979 and the governing equation is as follows 25 θ c t ρ s k p c t c p ρ p ε p t d d d e c u c k b c δ ij u c where θ represents the volume fraction of liquid dimensionless c p represents the concentration of contaminant adsorbed to solid phase mol kg ρ p represents the solid phase density of rock and soil mass kg m3 and is equal to ρ s 1 ε p ε p represents the porosity of matrix dimensionless the distribution coefficient k p adopts the linear isotherm adsorption model the dispersion coefficient d d adopts the two dimensional longitudinal and transverse diffusion model the effective diffusion coefficient d e adopts the millington quirk model the detailed information can be seen in section s3 in supporting materials the boundary and initial conditions of transport are 26 n j γ u t 0 y u n j γ d t 0 y d n j γ l t 0 y l n j γ r t 0 y r c ω t 0 k 2 where j represents the hydrodynamic dispersion flux mol m2 s y u y d y l and y r represent the concentration flux functions of the upper lower left and right boundaries respectively and k 2 represents the initial concentration mol m3 4 model settings in a rigorous sense the system of concern involves both saturated and unsaturated flow and transport process as a movable water table is presented the analytical modeling of this study approximates such a coupled saturated unsaturated flow into a simplified saturated flow and transport problem as done by most analytical modeling works concerning subsurface flow and transport by doing so the analytical work simplifies the unsaturated flow process using a properly defined water table condition the numerical modeling of this study however can actually simulate the integrated saturated and unsaturated flow and transport process one benefit of doing so is to check if the analytical modeling is a viable approach or not based on the conceptual model in section 1 fig 1 the injection pumping action of gcw will drive the groundwater circulation to form a three dimensional flow field with the wellbore as the central axis the lens is completely entrapped within the flow field the streamlines flowing near the surface of the lens will be bended around the lens because of the significant permeability contrast between the lens and the background aquifer and contaminants inside the lens will be transported to the aquifer through back diffusion and slow advection inside the lens after this the contaminants are transported to the pumping portion of the gcw and then pumped out for the purpose of illustration this study makes several assumptions regarding the geometry and position of the lens for a finite volume lens with irregular boundaries the flow field near the lens can be very complex thus to simplify the numerical simulation and illustration of results we have adopted a two dimensional 2d cross sectional surrogate model to represent the simplified three dimensional 3d model as shown in fig 4 in this 2d model the lens has a rectangle shape with the upper and lower sides parallel with the base of the aquifer if viewed from a 3d perspective the rectangle lens in the 2d model can be regarded as a sufficiently long lens along the y direction perpendicular to the xz plane in fig 4 or the extended lens and the circulation well is not a line source but a planar source or the so called extended well with a sufficient length along the y axis the sufficient lengths for the extended lens and extended well mean that those lengths are greater than the scale of influence caused by the pumping and injection operation of the circulation well we must point out that this 2d model is different from the actual 3d model when the lens is a finite volume near a circulation well depicted as a vertical line source despite such a difference the simplified 2d model help us gain the necessary insights into the problem which are helpful for understanding the complex 3d model in the future as shown in fig 4 the rectangular domain of concern is 11 m high and extends indefinitely in the horizontal direction take 10 m wide for simulation the rest is replaced by an infinite element which permits a lateral boundary condition that is sufficiently far from the rectangle domain of concern the gcw is located on the left boundary of the domain the right boundary is set to the right of the infinite element the low permeability lens is located on the right side of the gcw with its left boundary 1 m away from the left side of the domain and its upper boundary 5 5 m below the surface the rectangular lens is 0 5 m high and 2 m wide there is no rainfall and evaporation on the surface of the rectangular site the initial water table is located 1 m below the surface and the bottom of the aquifer is bounded by an aquifuge which is impermeable to flow and transport water is injected at a point 2 m below the surface from gcw the left boundary of domain in fig 4 and pumped out at a point 10 5 m below the surface it is notable that in this study the injection and pumping are treated as point source and sink respectively if injection and pumping are conducted over finite lengths then the injection and pumping should be treated as line source and sink respectively the high permeability aquifer or the low permeability lens itself is homogeneous and isotropic if vertical anisotropy exists one can use properly rescaled horizontal and vertical coordinates to convert the anisotropic aquifer into an isotropic aquifer thus vertical anisotropy is not specifically discussed here the initial contaminant concentration profile contains 0 02 mol m3 of otc within the low permeability lens and zero concentrations of otc outside the low permeability lens this of course is a simplified version of reality in which both the lens and background aquifer may contain non zero but different contaminant concentrations this simplification is for the purpose of illustration and it will not alter the primary conclusions of the work the relevant parameters involved in the flow and transport processes of the aquifer and lens have been used before in other studies and are shown in tables 2 and 3 yu 2017 comsol bortone et al 2020 bortone et al 2019 hydrus yu et al 2022 pan et al 2021 femwater lin et al 2017 vats et al 2020 and feflow kouamé et al 2019 huang et al 2020a huang et al 2020b are all finite element numerical simulation software that can simulate flow and transport in porous media the comsol simulation exercises in this paper serves the following purposes 1 comsol honors all the physical conditions and processes relevant in the analytical framework 2 comsol is a software package in which one can specify the expressions of constitutive equations governing partial differential equations and boundary conditions to solve 3 comsol is highly accurate with the adaptive mesh partitioning technology which provides two kinds of solutions for users to choose separation and full coupling li et al 2021 in this study comsol multiphysics is used to simulate the groundwater flow and contaminant transport processes in the study area the detailed information on mesh generation possible numerical errors associated with discretization as well as techniques to minimize numerical dispersion and numerical oscillation problems can be seen in section s8 in supporting materials it can be seen from section 1 1 that the evolution path with different stages dominated by biodegradation in the first stage is similar to the evolution path with different stages dominated by adsorption in the first stage as shown in fig 3 therefore the following simulation will take the evolution process dominated by adsorption as an example to capture the evolution paths with different evolution stages there are 11 evolutionary paths in the first stage which is dominated by adsorption as an example this study only shows one evolutionary path in each of the four evolutionary stages totaling four evolutionary paths to explain the essence of the problem the specific working condition settings are shown in table 3 5 results and discussion 5 1 results fig 5 shows the simulation results captured under the working condition one stage evolutionary path 1 set in table 3 to verify the one stage evolutionary path dominated by the first stage adsorption about 1300 days the four removal factors reached the complete removal stage as shown in fig 5 a until the completion of remediation during the whole remediation period max f rs so the adsorption is always dominant in the process of contaminant removal until the contaminant are completely removed it can be seen from fig 5 b that after the gcw starts to operate the contaminant removal rates driven by advection adsorption and biodegradation are in the initial stage within 7 min and the contaminant removal rate driven by hydrodynamic dispersion is in the initial stage within 12 min and after the initial stage the evolution process of each factor follows the evolution law described in section 1 the removal rate of contaminant driven by adsorption which is the dominant factor reaches the peak in the rising stage at 2 2 d and then the removal rate of contaminant driven by adsorption enters the falling stage fig 6 shows the simulation results captured under the working condition two stage evolutionary path 2 a set in table 3 to verify the two stage evolutionary path dominated by the first stage adsorption about 70 days the four removal factors reached the complete removal stage as shown in fig 6 a in the whole remediation period max f rs from the beginning of the gcw operation to 0 01 days adsorption is dominant in the process of contaminant removal the critical time tcr 1 2 for the transition from adsorption removal to advective removal is 0 01 d after this critical time one has max f ra and the advective removal factor dominates until the contaminant is completely removed it can be seen from fig 6 b that when gcw starts to operate the contaminant removal rates of the four removal factors are in the initial stage within 7 min after the initial stage the evolution process of each factor follows the evolution law described in section 1 the evolution of adsorption removal efficiency with time reaches the peak at 1 3 d and the evolution of advection removal efficiency with time reaches the peak at 1 1 d and then both of them enter the falling stage fig 7 shows the simulation results captured under the working condition three stage evolutionary path 3 b set in table 3 to verify the three stage evolutionary path dominated by the first stage adsorption about 1250 days the four removal factors reached the complete removal stage as shown in fig 7 a in the whole remediation period max f rs from the start of gcw operation to 0 7 d and the adsorption removal is dominant in the process of contaminant removal the critical time tcr 1 2 for the transition from adsorption removal to advective removal is 0 7 d after this critical time one has max f ra and advection is the dominant factor in the process of contaminant removal the critical time tcr 2 3 for the transition from advective removal to adsorption removal is 42 5 d after that max f rs adsorption becomes dominant again until the contaminant is completely removed it can be seen from fig 7 b that after the gcw starts to operate the contaminant removal rates driven by advection adsorption and biodegradation are in the initial stage within 7 min and the contaminant removal rate driven by hydrodynamic dispersion is in the initial stage within 12 min after the initial stage the evolution process of each factor follows the evolution law described in section 1 the evolution of adsorption removal efficiency with time reaches the peak at 1 4 days and the evolution of advection removal efficiency with time reaches the peak at 1 2 days and then both of them enter the falling stage fig 8 shows the simulation results captured under the working condition four stage evolutionary path 4 c set in table 3 to verify the four stage evolutionary path dominated by the first stage adsorption about 1350 days the four removal factors reached the complete removal stage as shown in fig 8 a in the whole remediation period max f rs from the beginning of the gcw operation to 0 8 d and the adsorption removal factor is dominant in the process of contaminant removal the critical time tcr 1 2 for the transition from adsorption removal to hydrodynamic dispersion removal is 0 8 d after which max f rd and hydrodynamic dispersion removal is dominant the critical time tcr 2 3 for the transition from the dominant hydrodynamic dispersion removal to the dominant advective removal is 1 31 d after which max f ra and the advective removal is dominant the critical time tcr 3 4 for the change from the dominant advective removal to the dominant adsorption removal is 100 d after which max f rs and the adsorption removal factor dominates again until the contaminant is completely removed it can be seen from fig 8 b that after the gcw starts to operate the removal rates of contaminant driven by advection and biodegradation are in the initial stage within 7 min and the removal rates of contaminant driven by hydrodynamic dispersion and adsorption are in the initial stage within 15 min after the initial stage the evolution process of each factor follows the evolution law described in section 1 the evolution of adsorption removal efficiency with time reaches the peak at 5 days in the rising stage and the evolution of hydrodynamic dispersion removal efficiency with time reaches the peak at 2 2 days in the rising stage and the evolution of advective removal efficiency with times reaches the peak at 2 days in the rising stage after that the three removal processes all enter the falling stage fig 9 shows the curve of the average concentration cheng et al 2022 of otc in the lens with time under the four evolution path conditions set in table 3 as can be seen from fig 9 the time for otc to be completely removed in the lens is as follows one stage evolutionary path 1 about 1300 days two stage evolutionary path 2 a about 70 days three stage evolutionary path 3 b about 1250 days and four stage evolutionary path 4 c about 1350 days which is consistent with the time when the four removal factors in the above mentioned evolution path reach the complete removal stage because the second stage of two stage evolutionary path 2 a is dominated by advection and the existence of gcw strengthens the advection through the low permeability lens thus when the evolution path is two stage evolutionary path 2 a the gcw can remediate the low permeability lens in the shortest time 5 2 parameter sensitivity analysis to further discuss the influence of hydrodynamic conditions and solute transport conditions on the evolution characteristics of the remediation process of secondary contaminant sources in low permeability lens driven by gcw a single factor sensitivity analysis is carried out on its parameters brunner et al 2009 the concerned parameters are the location of the injection point and pumping point of gcw the horizontal distance between the wellbore and the lens the rate of injection pumping used in gcw the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer and lens the adsorption coefficient inside lens the biodegradation coefficient inside lens the diffusion coefficient of contaminant inside and outside the lens and the longitudinal dispersivity in the lens and aquifer it should be noted that sensitivity analysis of transverse dispersivity are not discussed in the paper as longitudinal dispersivity usually exceeds transverse dispersivity by one to two orders of magnitude with a total of 12 parameters each parameter is set at five different levels and for specific parameter settings one can see table 4 and table 5 for details the detailed information can be seen in section s9 in supporting materials to present the influence of hydrodynamic parameters and solute transport parameters on the critical time in a concise and clear way we adopted a min max normalization method sinsomboonthong 2022 to process the data and the specific formula is as follows 27 x x min x max x min x where x represents the result of parameters normalization x represents the original parameters 5 2 1 sensitivity analysis of hydrodynamic parameters 5 2 1 1 influence of hydrodynamic parameters on evolution stage table 4 shows the effect of six hydrodynamic parameters on the evolution stage that taking the three stage evolutionary path 3 b as an example it can be seen from table 4 that as the height of the water injection point decreases the height of the water pumping point increases the horizontal distance between the wellbore and the lens increases and the rate of injection pumping of gcw decreases the evolution stage of contaminant remediation evolves from the three stage evolution path to the one stage evolution path the change of the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer or lens does not lead to the evolution of the remediation path within the range of variation of each parameter discussed above the adsorption removal factor is dominant in the first stage of the following one stage two stage and three stage evolutionary paths the advection removal factor is dominant in the second stage of the two stage and the three stage evolutionary paths the adsorption removal factor is dominant in the third stage of the three stage evolution path the detailed information can be seen in section s4 in supporting materials 5 2 1 2 influence of hydrodynamic parameters on critical moment fig 10 shows the effect of six hydrodynamic parameters on tcr1 2 and tcr2 3 using the three stage evolutionary path 3 b set in table 4 as an example fig 10 a shows the effect of each hydraulic parameter on tcr 1 2 and one can see that tcr 1 2 has a linear negative correlation with the saturated hydraulic conductivity inside the lens a nonlinear positive correlation with the injection height and the horizontal distance between the wellbore and the lens a nonlinear negative correlation with the pumping height and injection pumping rate and a no correlation with the saturated hydraulic conductivity outside the lens the detailed information can be seen in section s5 1 in supporting materials fig 10 b shows the effect of each hydraulic parameter on tcr 2 3 as shown in fig 10 b tcr 2 3 is linear negative related to the saturated hydraulic conductivity inside the lens nonlinear positive related to the height of the pumping point the injection pumping rate and the saturated hydraulic conductivity outside the lens and nonlinear negative related to the height of the injection point and the horizontal distance between the wellbore and the lens the detailed information can be seen in section s5 2 in supporting materials 5 2 2 sensitivity analysis of solute transport parameters 5 2 2 1 influence of solute transport parameters on evolution stage table 5 shows the effect of six solute transport parameters on the evolution stage using the three stage evolutionary path 3 b as an example it can be seen from table 5 that with the increase of biodegradation coefficient of the lens the evolution stage of contaminant remediation evolves from the three stage evolution path to the one stage evolution path and the adsorption coefficient longitudinal dispersion inside and outside the lens and diffusion coefficient of contaminant inside and outside the lens do not lead to the evolution of the evolution path of contaminant remediation under the variation of each parameter the adsorption removal factor is dominant in the first stage of the one stage evolution path and the three stage evolution path the advection removal factor is dominant in the second stage of the three stage evolution path and the adsorption removal factor is dominant in the third stage the detailed information can be seen in section s6 in supporting materials 5 2 2 2 influence of solute transport parameters on critical moment fig 11 shows the effect of six solute transport parameters on tcr1 2 and tcr2 3 using the three stage evolutionary path 3 b set in table 5 as an example fig 11 a shows the effect of each solute transport parameter on tcr 1 2 as shown in fig 11 a tcr 1 2 is linear positive correlated with the biodegradation coefficient in the lens the longitudinal dispersivity inside the lens and the diffusion coefficient of contaminant inside and outside the lens is linear negative correlation with the longitudinal dispersion outside the lens and is nonlinear positive correlated with the adsorption coefficient in the lens the detailed information can be seen in section s7 1 in supporting materials fig 11 b shows the effect of each solute transport parameter on tcr 2 3 as shown in fig 11 b tcr 2 3 has a linear positive correlation with the longitudinal dispersivity inside and outside the lens and the diffusion coefficient of contaminant inside the lens has a linear negative correlation with the diffusion coefficient of contaminant outside the lens and has a nonlinear negative correlation with the adsorption coefficient and biodegradation coefficient in the lens the detailed information can be seen in section s7 2 in supporting materials 5 3 the innovations and limitations of the study in this paper an idealized physical model is used to construct a theoretical framework for the remediation of contaminant evolution in a low permeability lens in an aquifer by a gcw the low permeability lens in the study area is located in a homogeneously saturated aquifer the geometry of the lens is rectangular and the water circulation is driven by pumping and injection from gcw without other source sink terms to simplify the analysis of the contaminant evolution process only a single contaminant lens is considered and only transport processes of advection hydrodynamic dispersion adsorption and biodegradation were considered under the above conditions the innovative contributions of this study can be briefly summarized as follows first four mechanisms of contaminant removal in low permeability lens driven by a gcw have been explored second a theoretical framework has been constructed to describe the remediation process in low permeability lens driven by a gcw third the evolution path of the contaminant removal process in the low permeability lens has been explored the evolution stages are divided and the critical state and critical conditions of the transformation between the evolution stages are defined fourth the effects of hydrodynamic parameters and solute transport parameters on the remediation process are analyzed and prioritized based on this study it can be seen that the essence of contaminant removal in the lens driven by the gcw involves the change of dominating roles played by different driving factors to stimulating the transition of the evolutionary path in the system the established theoretical framework of evolution paths in this study can help us understand the relationship between the contaminant removal paths the transition of paths and the contaminants removal process under different driving factors this will guide us to explore how to adjust the driving factors through engineering measures so as to achieve the purpose of improving the contaminants remediation efficiency involving the contaminated low permeability lens to further explore the mechanism of gcw remediation of contaminant in the low permeability lens in the aquifer the following points need to be explored in future research first compared with equilibrium adsorption the adsorption rate in non equilibrium adsorption is usually greater or less than desorption rate zhao et al 2007 for the non equilibrium adsorption with greater adsorption rate than desorption rate the solid phase adsorption rate is faster than the equilibrium adsorption rate otherwise it is slower therefore the effects of equilibrium adsorption and non equilibrium adsorption on the removal rate of pollutants driven by adsorption are different this difference will lead to changes in the duration and start and end time of the pollution removal stage dominated by adsorption in the evolution path of pollution removal thus the specific evolutionary path changes the influence of equilibrium adsorption and non equilibrium adsorption on the evolutionary path will be discussed in the future second the biodegradation includes aerobic biodegradation anoxic biodegradation and anaerobic biodegradation otc can be biodegraded in aerobic anoxic and anaerobic reactions yang 2010 in this paper the differences among aerobic anoxic and anaerobic pairs of evolutionary paths are not specified in details further exploration of this issue will be carried out in the future third in this paper the 2d cross sectional model is used to simplify the 3d flow field in the conceptual model although the 2d model provides very useful insights into the problem one must conduct a 3d model to understand the actual performance of gcw for realistic remediation process involving a finite volume 3d lens with possibly irregular shape fourth an idealized homogeneous aquifer is used in the model setting in this paper but in the actual remediation of contaminated sites the aquifer outside of the low permeability lens is mostly heterogeneous furthermore multiple lenses may be randomly distributed in the aquifer in subsequent studies the influence of aquifer heterogeneity the irregularity of lens geometry and the randomness of lenses distribution and the existence of unsaturated zones on the evolution process will be further explored 6 summary and conclusions in this study the remediation process of secondary contaminant sources in low permeability lens driven by gcw is taken as the research object the mechanism of contaminant removal process in low permeability lens is explored and the theoretical framework for describing the contaminant removal process in low permeable lens driven by gcw is constructed in the theoretical framework developed in this study the evolution process of contaminant removal rate in low permeability lens is summarized the evolution stages are divided and the critical state and critical condition are defined the numerical simulation method is used to test the developed theoretical framework and the parameter sensitivity analysis is used to reveal the influence of different contaminant removal factors on the contaminant removal process in the low permeability lens the specific conclusions are as follows in this study the evolution process of contaminant removal in the low permeability lens driven by gcw are as follows the evolution process of contaminant removal rate driven by advection hydrodynamic dispersion and adsorption includes four stages namely an initial stage a rising stage a falling stage and a complete removal stage the evolution process of contaminant removal driven by biodegradation includes three stages namely an initial stage a falling stage and a complete removal stage the evolution paths of contaminant removal dominated by adsorption or biodegradation in the first stage are discussed and the evolution paths are divided into four categories namely the one stage two stage three stage and four stage evolution paths totaling 22 evolution paths and according to different dominant factors in the evolutionary path the conditions of evolutionary stages transition called the critical conditions are established and four evolutionary stages dominated by advection hydrodynamic dispersion adsorption or biodegradation are defined the critical state and critical condition are defined according to the relative relationship of contaminant removal rate in each evolution stage by setting a single gcw to remediate a rectangular low permeability secondary contaminant source in a 2d cross sectional view and adjusting its hydrodynamic parameters and solute transport parameters the evolution paths of the one stage two stage three stage and four stage are captured in which the first stage is dominated by adsorption the theoretical framework is verified through the single factor sensitivity analysis the influence of hydrodynamic parameters on the evolution process is as follows with the height of injection point from high to low the height of pumping point from low to high the horizontal distance between wellbore and lens from small to large and the injection pumping rate from large to small the evolution path of contaminant remediation evolves from three stage evolution path to one stage evolution path and the variation of the saturated hydraulic conductivities inside and outside the lens do not lead to the evolution of the remediation path the effect on the critical time is as follows tcr 1 2 is positively related to the height of the injection point and the horizontal distance between the wellbore and the lens is negatively related to the saturated hydraulic conductivity inside the lens the height of the pumping point and the injection pumping rate and it is no correlation with the saturated hydraulic conductivity outside the lens tcr 2 3 is positively related to the saturated hydraulic conductivity outside the lens the height of the pumping point and the injection pumping rate and it is negatively related to the saturated hydraulic conductivity inside the lens the height of the injection point and the horizontal distance between the wellbore and the lens through the single factor sensitivity analysis the influence of solute transport parameters on the evolution process is as follows with the increase of the biodegradation coefficient of the lens the evolution path of contaminant remediation evolves from the three stage path to the one stage path the adsorption coefficient longitudinal dispersion coefficient inside and outside the lens and diffusion coefficient of contaminant inside and outside the lens do not lead to the evolution of the remediation path the effect on the critical time is as follows tcr 1 2 is positively related to the biodegradation coefficient of the lens the longitudinal dispersivity inside the lens the diffusion coefficient inside and outside the lens and the adsorption coefficient inside the lens and it is negatively related to the longitudinal dispersivity outside the lens tcr 2 3 is positively related to the longitudinal dispersivity inside and outside the lens and the diffusion coefficient inside the lens and it is negatively related to the adsorption coefficient the biodegradation coefficient inside the lens and the diffusion coefficient outside the lens credit authorship contribution statement shen feng investigation methodology

2947,the aral sea has been persistently shrinking in past decades and the influence of the lake water level changes on vegetation in the lake retreat areas is uncertain in this study we quantitatively assessed the vegetation development due to relevant hydrological changes in the retreat area of the aral sea the results showed that the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi in the retreat area displayed an overall increase from 1986 to 2020 the increasing vegetated area accounted for 84 of the total area of the south aral sea which was caused by an increase in the exposed lakebed area however about 40 of the area in the north aral sea was the increasing vegetated area due to the improved water environment when the depth to water table dtw was larger than 7 8 m vegetation development was more dependent on precipitation than groundwater when dtw was less than 7 8 m groundwater had a more significant impact than precipitation on vegetation development the negative impacts of groundwater salinity exceed the positive contributions of water supply on vegetation development which differs to the common understanding under conditions of fresh or brackish groundwater in arid climates water level recovery is an effective option for improving vegetation establishment on the exposed seabed otherwise the exposed seabed area observed during the period 1990s 2010s in the eastern basin may remain a saline desert for a long period in the future finally an empirical relationship between ndvi and water levels was established which can be used for lake water level management that considers vegetation development in the retreated area of the aral sea keywords aral sea vegetation dynamics ndvi depth to water table salinity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction groundwater may be a dominant water supply for vegetation in terrestrial ecosystems around the world especially in regions where precipitation is scarce and groundwater occurs at shallow depths fan et al 2013 the water source for vegetation growth and distribution is mainly derived from precipitation surface runoff and groundwater zeng et al 2020 in arid and semi arid regions low precipitation with high evapotranspiration and limited surface runoff do not provide sufficient water for vegetation growth xia et al 2016 groundwater often becomes an important water source especially for riparian and littoral plants lamontagne et al 2005 in the last few decades many large lakes worldwide have experienced persistent shrinkage wurtsbaugh et al 2017 leading to a decline in the groundwater level in the riparian zone gross 2017 degraded riparian zones due to lake shrinking often cause ecological and environmental damage to vegetation growth biodiversity landscape aesthetic values and water and land quality they also seriously threaten the health and safety of the local population around the lake coops et al 2004 soil water salinity and the depth to water table dtw are considered the dominant driving factors of these damages the buried depth of groundwater influences the upward flow that replenishes soil water which in turn influences the uptake of water by plant roots sutton and price 2020 the deeper the water table the more difficult it is for plants to uptake soil water recharged by groundwater via capillaries musa et al 2019 yan and guo 2019 groundwater drawdowns may even result in cyclic succession and regression patterns of riparian vegetation van and van der valk 1981 the coverage and abundance of riparian plants were found to decrease with decreasing groundwater table depth such as in lower reaches of the tarim river northwest china chen et al 2014 the gradual decline of groundwater resulted in the succession of vegetation communities from wetland to drought resistant types and even to bare land yang et al 2019 with regard to the close relations between vegetation and groundwater spatial patterns of groundwater relevant vegetation communities and coverage have been widely studied chui et al 2011 jin et al 2014 zhu et al 2015 bhanja et al 2019 it is generally recognized that a declining water table causes vegetation to change from aquatic and mesophytic herbs to xerophytic and sandy shrubs cui and shao 2005 salinity is also an important factor influencing the vegetation groundwater interactions in arid regions salt in groundwater migrates upward to the soil profile through capillary rise and accumulates in the surface layer due to evaporation this is critically the case in the upward dominant arid and semi arid regions where evaporative demand far exceeds precipitation the higher the salt content in groundwater the shallower the water table the drier the climate and the greater the risks of salt accumulation abliz et al 2016 haj amor et al 2017 resulting in more harmful effects on the establishment and development of vegetation ondrasek and rengel 2020 excess salinity could impair the growth of plants and further threaten their survival kang 2004 groundwater salinity may therefore play a dominant role in shaping the spatial patterns of plant communities in arid regions khan et al 1976 cardinale 2011 gonzález alcaraz et al 2014 xi et al 2016 due to the decline of the aral sea the once submerged lakebed is now exposed to an arid climate resulting in ecological environmental and human health consequences wæhler and dietrichs 2017 the water level of the sea decreased from 53 4 m above sea level asl in 1960 to 42 5 m in the north aral sea 23 3 m in the western basin and 26 4 m in the eastern basin of the south aral sea in 2020 cawater 2021 water level decline caused an exposed lakebed area of approximately 60112 km2 micklin 2014 shrinkage of the water body caused a significant increase in salt content from 10 6 g l in 1960 to 220 2 g l in 2008 in the eastern basin and 193 5 g l in 2019 in the western basin kuz mina and treshkin 2009 aladin et al 2019 however the salt content decreased to 5 8 g l in 2019 in the north aral sea in response to water recovery the current low salt content in the north aral sea is due to the restoration of water levels and water bodies through runoff recharge from syr darya due to the establishment of the kokaral dam in kazakhstan in 2005 aladin et al 2018 pioneer plant species colonized on the dry seafloor in response to the sea shrinkage wucherer and breckle 2001 breckle 2020 a few euryhaline species have been identified and different plant communities have developed micklin et al 2020 the water level decrease formed vegetation successions from hydrophytic and low salt tolerant species to xerophilic and highly salt tolerant species dimeyeva 2007 shomurodov et al 2021 floristic investigations since the 1960 s identified floristic successions namely psammoseres haloseres and potamoseres dimeyeva 2015 the successions were affected by hydrological regimes soil texture and salinity dimeyeva 2015 shomurodov et al 2021 the sea shrinkage and salinization caused a decrease in hydromorphic vegetation a disappearance in the thickets of freshwater pondweeds and most riparian tugay forests and a gradual replacement of freshwater plants with halotolerant plants aladin et al 1998 the vegetation on the exposed lakebed of the south aral sea has been significantly degraded resulting in salt dust storms and respiratory diseases wæhler and dietrichs 2017 restoration of vegetation cover is considered an important method for solving the ecological and environmental problems in the aral sea region which is limited by hydrodynamic conditions and soil properties on the dry seafloor an et al 2020 kim et al 2020 a quantitative understanding of the relationships between vegetation and hydrological regimes is fundamental to vegetation restoration in this region earlier studies investigated the temporal and spatial changes in vegetation in the exposed lakebed of the aral sea smimov 1875 wucherer 1979 wucherer et al 2001 breckle et al 1998 breckle 2013 kamalov et al 2001 dimeyeva 2007 2015 shomurodov and adilov 2019 shomurodov et al 2021 however quantitative descriptions of the changes in hydrological forcing are still insufficient precipitation and groundwater are the main sources of soil moisture for vegetation in the retreat area as identified by aladin et al 2009 the effects of a decreased groundwater table and increased salinity on ecosystems as a result of lake regression should not be ignored the aims of this paper were to 1 evaluate the temporal and spatial variability of vegetation cover and 2 quantitatively explore the effects of hydrological regimes and salinity on vegetation development in the retreat area of the aral sea 2 study area this study focused on the exposed seabed of the aral sea since 1960 the aral sea is the terminal lake of the amu and syr darya in central asia fig 1 before the 1960s it was the fourth largest inland water body in the world and its area was 68900 km2 micklin 2014 its steep west coast is located on the eastern edge of the ustyurt plateau 150 m above the lake the karakum desert is located to the southwest and the kyzylkum desert is located to the northeast before 1960 the lake had a length of 426 km from north to south and a width of 284 km from east to west its mean depth is 16 m with a maximum depth of 69 m micklin 2007 cawater 2021 due to the characteristics of the vast area shallow depth water body it is thus very sensitive to water level fluctuations the aral sea region experiences a continental climate rainfall is scarce and atmospheric demand is high the average annual precipitation is less than 250 mm and the potential annual evaporation varies from 800 mm to 1300 mm shen et al 2019 kim et al 2020 the temperature increases from north to south with a monthly average minimum of 12 c to 0 c in january and a maximum of 24 c to 32 c in july the aral sea declined sharply since the 1960 s which was attributed to a remarkable reduction in inflow from the amu and syr darya rivers micklin 2014 the reduction was mainly caused by water withdrawal for irrigation bortnik 1999 cretaux et al 2013 the long term negative water balance resulted in the extensive retreat of the lake in 1989 the lake was divided into two water bodies the north aral sea and the south aral sea izhitskiy et al 2016 in 2003 the south split into the eastern and western basins which are hydraulically connected to each other sometimes ge et al 2016 in the early 1990s the kokaral dam was constructed between the south and north aral sea the south receives water from the amu darya and the north receives water from the syr darya specifically the water level in the north aral sea has recovered to 41 43 m asl since 2005 the level in the south aral sea continued to decline until the 2010 s the remaining area ratio of the aral sea was only 12 or 8 2 103 km2 in 2020 and 6 9 104 km2 in 1960 the water level declined from 53 4 m asl in 1960 to 42 5 m asl north aral sea 23 3 m asl west of south aral sea and 26 4 m asl east of south aral sea in 2020 the salt concentration increased significantly during the retreat the inter annual variations in water level and salt concentrations are discussed in detail in the following sections 3 materials and methods 3 1 data 3 1 1 climate few observational data are available for the study area zavialov 2005 we therefore used the precipitation dataset of the climatic research unit cru ts v 4 05 https crudata uea ac uk cru data hrg as the alternative the annual precipitation data used in this study spanned from 1986 to 2020 with a spatial resolution of 0 5 previous studies have indicated that the cru dataset exhibits good performance in central asia wang et al 2020 yang et al 2020 3 1 2 vegetation cover the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi was used to describe vegetation cover in the study area the details about ndvi calculated from the satellite information can be found in rouse et al 1974 the landsat 4 5 7 8 images from 1986 to 2020 were used to derive the ndvi maps the images had a temporal resolution of 16 days and a spatial resolution of 30 m the landsat datasets used in this study were archived in the google earth engine gee platform the data processing was performed by using the javascript programming language on the google earth engine platform https earthengine google com we derived the ndvi in the growth season from april to october gessner et al 2013 li et al 2015 jiang et al 2017 the median ndvi value for each growth season was used as the representative of the year the retreat area was defined as the exposed lakebed of the aral sea since 1960 it was delineated into elevation zones with equal contour intervals of 1 m ndvi varies within the zones the frequency distribution of ndvi for each elevation zone was analyzed and is shown in supplementary figs 1 3 for simplicity the mean ndvi values within each elevation zone were used in the following analysis the same statistical method was applied by lv et al 2013 3 1 3 groundwater table and salinity observations of the groundwater table are important information for the analysis in this study however few measurements are readily available for use in the retreated area of the aral sea pan et al 2020 previous studies have found that the groundwater table fluctuations in riparian zones were primarily controlled by water level variations in the respective lakes wahyuni et al 2009 li et al 2018 javadzadeh et al 2020 such as the positive correlation coefficients determined in poyang lake 0 96 li et al 2018 and the lake urmia basin 0 95 javadzadeh et al 2020 moreover some studies used the lake water table as an alternative to the groundwater table in riparian areas vesipa et al 2016 monitoring data of the water level in the aral sea is readily available singh et al 2018 and was used as a proxy for the groundwater table in this study moreover we assume that the salt content in the groundwater is the same as that in the lake annual water levels for the period 1986 2020 were acquired from the portal of knowledge for water and environmental issues in central asia http www cawater info net the salt content dataset was compiled from relevant studies keith et al 2013 gaybullaev et al 2014 aladin et al 2018 2019 and field expeditions in 2019 the sampling sites are shown in fig 1 3 1 4 digital elevation model dem depths to the groundwater table were derived from topographic maps and the groundwater table which uses the lake water level as a proxy the topographic map for the exposed lakebed before 2000 is based on the dem map of the space shuttle radar terrain mission srtm data released by the u s geological survey in 2018 with a 30 m spatial resolution the horizontal datum plane in the geographical coordinate system adopts the wgs84 coordinate system and the vertical datum plane egm96 the data for the lakebed that became exposed from the water after 2000 are based on a 1 500000 topographic map of the aral sea bottom through on boat detection in the 1960s benduhn and renard 2004 the map used the same projection systems as the dem and was gridded to 30 m 3 2 analysis methods 3 2 1 trend analysis inter annual change trends of ndvi series were detected by the non parametric mann kendall m k test and sen s slope mann 1945 kendall 1975 the method is widely used and described in detail in many studies machiwal and jha 2012 şen 2017 the slope of a linear trend is estimated by a nonparametric method proposed by sen 1968 which is widely used to estimate the annual change rate of meteorological and hydrological variations shah and mishra 2016 zhu et al 2019 pan et al 2020 3 2 2 correlation analysis the pearson correlation coefficient r was applied to evaluate the regression relationship between ndvi and dtw and the details about the method can be found in precious studies pearson 1920 yuan et al 2015 pan et al 2020 3 2 3 principal component analysis in order to identify the main component for the changes in vegetation growth on the exposed lakebed of the aral sea the principal component analysis pca was employed to explore the most influential parameters ringnér 2008 page et al 2012 3 2 4 establishing ndvi dtw relations the retreat area was delineated into elevation bands with an equal interval of 1 m on the topographic map when an elevation band was located above the lake level statistical analysis of the ndvi values was performed when the water level was located within a band the statistical analysis was performed with respect to the exposed portion the analysis was performed with regard to three portions of the split aral sea the north aral sea the east and west basins of the south as shown in fig 1 to assess the effects of dtw changes on vegetation every 1 m dtw interval was employed to obtain a set of corresponding ndvi values then to facilitate analysis the arithmetic mean of each group of ndvi values was calculated to obtain an ndvi value in this way the ndvi values for different groundwater depths were calculated every year finally the corresponding annual ndvi at 1 m dtw intervals in the retreat area from the water level to 52 m asl was calculated from 1986 to 2020 in the three portions of the aral sea in the analysis the ndvi was averaged for every five years discussed in section 4 3 1 4 results and discussion 4 1 spatial distributions of vegetation in 2020 the vegetation status in 2020 indicated by the ndvi over the exposed seabed is shown in fig 2 vegetation cover in the delta areas of two rivers was the highest in this study area tugaic vegetation was formed in these regions micklin et al 2020 where the relatively high groundwater table low salinity and frequent periodic floods are favorable for plants ndvi values decreased toward the sea indicating a decrease in vegetation coverage meanwhile the ndvi values indicate denser vegetation cover on vozrozhdeniya island and in the belt along the southern coastline during the 1960 s where floristic diversity has always been rich shomurodov and adilov 2019 a previous qualitative analysis concluded that successions occurred mainly due to changes in hydrological regimes dimeyeva 2015 vegetation development is subjected to different hydrodynamic conditions and soil salinity the exposed soil salinity showed an upward trend from the older coastline to the present one due to the recession duan et al 2022 the soil salinity also plays an important role in vegetation colonization and development an et al 2018 in this study ndvi will be used as a proxy of vegetation status to quantitatively analyze vegetation development in response to ground water decrease and salinity increase with time since the 1980s 4 2 intra and inter annual variations of ndvi 4 2 1 intra annual variations averaged over each five years from 1986 to 2020 the mean ndvi values over the exposed seabed area within the typical elevation range of 41 52 m asl are depicted in fig 3 and the monthly ndvi changes for each elevation band individually can be found in the supplementary fig 4 seasonally the ndvi firstly peaked in early june and late july and reached its minimum in january the seasonal distribution follows that of temperature and precipitation in this region the seasonal hydrologic regime significantly affected vegetation changes an increase in soil moisture promoted the growth of vegetation during spring and summer soil salinity and texture are also important factors that affect flora and vegetation development breckle 2013 in the following analysis the median ndvi values from april to october were used to represent the seasonal vegetation variability 4 2 2 change trends of ndvi since 1986 the changing trends and the slopes of the pixel ndvi values from 1986 to 2020 are mapped in fig 4 generally the vegetation cover increased or remained stable in the study region table 1 however ndvi showed some decreases as shown by the red colored portions in fig 4 but the percentage area was small the decreasing portions are located in deltas of amu and syr darya rivers and in the belt along the initial shoreline in the south aral sea this region with the highest vegetation coverage in 2020 as described in the previous section in fact vegetation has developed to the current state along a timeline of floristic successions and vegetation cover development since the early 1960s which were jointly affected by precipitation decreasing groundwater levels and increasing depth to groundwater and water salinity 4 3 impacts of hydrological regimes on ndvi changes the exposed lakebed of the aral sea is a natural laboratory of vegetation succession wucherer and breckle 2001 vegetation grows with the intervention of groundwater variations and soil salinity which shows different patterns in the exposed lakebed of the aral sea from the common understanding mentioned above in the early 1960s the aral sea began to retreat the lakebed began to emerge from the water and pioneer plant species began to grow on the exposed seafloor since then successions of vegetations lasted almost 60 years and the main vegetation changed from initial hydrophytic vegetation to xerophilic and hyperhalophytic vegetation dimeyeva 2015 shomurodov et al 2021 over the past 60 years the south aral sea has continued to retreat and the seabed synchronously became more exposed resulting in newly exposed elevation bands interestingly different episodes of vegetation succession were observed in different zones of the exposed seabed this suggests that the primary succession of plants on the dry seabed was attributed to changes in hydrological regimes and soil salinity dimeyeva 2015 4 3 1 relationship between ndvi and the depth to water table dtw due to the unavailability of measurements we assume that the groundwater table is approximated the lake water level due to the relatively flat terrain of the exposed lakebed the dtw was thus estimated as the difference between the elevations of the exposed lakebed and the lake water level this assumption may be problematic which will be discussed later the pixel based ndvi values were first averaged over each five year period from 1986 and then over each elevation band the dtw was divided into 1 m intervals in order to analyze the relationship between vegetation development and dtw the ndvi and corresponding dtw for each elevation band are plotted in fig 5 the tails of the curves for each 5 year period indicate the lake water level and thus the groundwater level at that time vegetation has improved since 1986 in the retreated area around the three sub water bodies the ndvi changes with dtw are similar on the exposed seabed of the eastern fig 5a and western fig 5b basins of the south aral sea but are quite different to that of the north fig 5c in the south aral sea ndvi increased with increasing dtw since 1986 for the north aral sea the ndvi decreased with dtw to some extent and then increased with deeper dtw it is commonly understood that vegetation depends on groundwater in arid areas and the deeper the depth to groundwater the harder it is for plants to utilize water lv et al 2013 yang et al 2019 vegetation grow in arid and semi arid areas that rely on precipitation and or groundwater hao et al 2010 zhu et al 2015 and groundwater is usually the main water source lamontagne et al 2005 hao et al 2010 however when groundwater is buried too deep precipitation may become the only source of water for vegetation elmore et al 2006 nezlin et al 2005 jiang et al 2017 these interpretations are mainly based on the predominantly stable floristic communities and fresh or brackish groundwater this observation in the aral sea is uncommon as it differs to the typical understanding of the vegetation groundwater relationship in other arid areas fig 5 the use of groundwater by plants may cease at some dtw the extinct dtw varies among plant types stand ages soil properties such as hydraulic conductivity and climate eamus et al 2016 sperry and hacke 2002 similar to the arid climate in the aral sea region groundwater dominates the water source for herb and shrub vegetation in the lower tarim river and heihe river in northwest china the plant species richness in the tarim river basin is alike to that in the aral sea basin novikova 2001 zeng et al 2019 it has been reported that the extinct dtw for most tree shrub and herb vegetation was approximately 6 m in the tarim river hao et al 2010 zeng et al 2019 2020 and 5 6 m in the heihe river wang et al 2011 the exposed lakebed of aral sea is dominated by shrubs such as haloxylon aphyllum with an average maximum root depth of about 7 m fan et al 2017 wucherer et al 2001 also herbs grow in this area such as salsola ruthenica with an average maximum root depth of about 2 m the extinct dtw for the riparian vegetation of the aral sea has scarcely been reported in earlier studies we estimated it to be at 7 8 m below the ground as shown in fig 5c above which the ndvi increases with decreasing dtw for the southern parts of the aral sea extinct dtws cannot be identified from the ndvi dtw curves in fig 5a and b however they were roughly estimated to be the same as those in the north aral sea as mentioned in the earlier section the ndvi dtw relationship differs to the common knowledge of this relationship in arid regions to address these issues four representative elevation bands were selected to investigate the ndvi and its attributing factors as shown in fig 6 elevation bands i iii are located on the exposed seabed of the south aral sea i along the original coastline in the 1960 s and the island and ii around the water body of the western basin and iii eastern basin elevation iv is located around the water body of the north aral sea their dtws can be categorized into two groups i more than 7 8 m and ii iv less than 7 8 m the relationships between ndvi and precipitation p and groundwater level gwl for representative elevation bands are presented in fig 7 in addition the salt content groundwater level relationships are also presented for the three water bodies in fig 7 notably we assume that the groundwater salt content is synchronous with that in the water body 4 3 2 precipitation and groundwater our results demonstrate that ndvi increases with increasing precipitation regardless of the water body location elevation bands and dtws fig 7a d and g the annual precipitation was only approximately 150 mm from 1986 to 2020 and the ndvi varied according to the inter annual variation of precipitation the effect of rainfall on vegetation growth becomes more significant when the groundwater is too deep jiang et al 2017 elmore et al 2006 haloxerophytic grasslands and shrubby plants can utilize rainfall during the growing season for their development wucherer et al 2001 wesche and ronnenberg 2010 regression analysis inferred a significant correlation p 0 05 when dtw was more than 7 8 m indicating that precipitation acted a significant role in vegetation growth in the eastern and western basins when dtw was less than 7 8 m the impact of precipitation on ndvi was not significant for the north aral sea precipitation significantly contributed to the ndvi increase regardless of the dtw and the effect was more significant p 0 01 for dtws greater than 7 8 m than for those equivalent to 7 8 m it can be concluded from the above analysis that ndvi development in the original coastline region depends on precipitation rather than the groundwater contribution precipitation infiltrates into the soil and supplies vegetation through soil moisture hence in this case the soil moisture contribution remains significant dtw shows more impact than precipitation when dtw is less than 7 8 m see fig 7b e and h in the south aral sea the ndvi in the eastern basin fig 7b and western basin fig 7e increases with decreasing groundwater level and thus increasing depth to groundwater this is contrary to the typical understanding of the vegetation groundwater relations in arid regions where vegetation growth is promoted when the groundwater table is shallower however in the north aral sea the ndvi dtw relation follows the typical understanding of this relationship the groundwater level has shown an upward trend in recent years the lake water salt content decreased to 5 8 g l in 2019 in response to groundwater level recovery aladin et al 2019 accordingly groundwater salinity has been low in recent years the lower groundwater and soil salinity produced favorable conditions for vegetation growth it is worth noting that vegetation development in areas with high soil moisture maybe not always good supplementary figs 5 6 it is limited by soil salinity and growth time around the water surface in the south aral sea although the soil moisture is higher the ndvi is lower this is due to the impact of high groundwater and soil salinity which makes it harder for vegetation to colonize and develop on this area 4 3 3 salinity the aral sea has been a saline lake during the 1960s the single water body had an average salt content of 10 6 g l it is an inland lake with no outlets salt is transported to the lake via the recharge of syr and amu darya rivers the water is removed because of surface evaporation while the salt remains these processes describe the general water and salt balances of the lake consequently the water bodies become increasingly saline as the lake retreats the north and the south aral sea separated in 1989 then a dam between the two parts was constructed in 2005 izhitskiy et al 2016 the south aral sea was divided into two basins in 2003 ge et al 2016 the different water bodies have different water and salt balancing processes owing to the differences in water input fig 7c and f show the changes in salt content with decreasing groundwater level for the eastern and western basins respectively and fig 7i shows the groundwater level rise in the north aral sea the increasing ndvi with a deepening groundwater table in the eastern fig 7b and western fig 7e basins may be explained by the intertwined salt impacts it is well known that soils under salinity stress will inhibit the growth of plants and impair their production tuteja 2007 the salinity stress will lead to the accumulation of ionic toxicity e g na cl in plants osmotic pressure imbalance and oxidative damage thus limiting the absorption of soil water and nutrients shrivastava and kumar 2015 consequently it causes damage to plants and then produces negative effects on the environment the increasing salinity will cause the degradation of freshwater plants which were replaced by more salt tolerant plant communities and further plant species and density changes fagherazzi et al 2019 soil salinity will also affect the seed germination colonized species and growth rate of plants woods et al 2020 the negative impacts of salt content is likely to exceed the positive impacts of groundwater contribution to vegetation development the increase in lake water salinity led to the soil salinization of the dry seafloor shen et al 2019 as the water level drops the salt contained in the lake water remains in the exposed seabed soils consequently most of the exposed lakebed was dominated by sandy deposits which accumulated up to 10 12 of salts stulina and sektimenko 2004 the higher the salt content of the water the higher the salt content in the soil profile as a result the exposed soil salinity exhibited an upward trend from the former to the present shoreline in the south aral sea vegetation began to colonize the dry bed and natural succession was initiated successions of floristic communities and species were driven by soil water availability soil texture and soil salinity the vegetation cover developed under the forcing of precipitation fig 7a d and g and the combined effects of groundwater contribution and soil salinity fig 7b c e f and h i soil salinity stress has a negative effect on vegetation growth shrivastava and kumar 2015 pang et al 2010 tian et al 2020 thus the vegetation cover showed a downward trend from the older coastal line to the present one fig 5a b under the condition of less saline groundwater such as in lower reaches of the heihe and tarim rivers the plant use of groundwater decreased with increasing dtw and extinguished at approximately 6 m below the ground this was also found in the exposed seafloor of the north aral sea where the extinct dtw was approximately 7 8 m the ground water salt content was reported as 0 5 35 g l and 0 4 35 g l in lower reaches of the tarim river xu et al 2014 and heihe river wen et al 2005 respectively comparatively the salt content of the north aral sea varied within the range of 5 8 29 6 g l fig 7i however the situations for the eastern and western basins were quite different for example when the representative elevation bands 33 34 m asl and 29 30 m asl became exposed from the water the corresponding water salt contents were 62 g l fig 7c and 112 g l fig 7f respectively thereafter the eastern and western basins continued to decline and the salt content continued to increase to approximately 260 g l and 193 g l respectively the hypersaline groundwater and consequently the high soil salt content should have had a more negative than positive contribution to vegetation growth moreover the negative impacts decreased as the groundwater table decreased therefore ndvi increased with deeper dtw fig 5a b in the north aral sea the ndvi began to increase when the dtw was more than 7 8 m fig 5c correspondingly these were mainly located in areas with low soil salinity and well developed vegetation such as vozrozhdeniya island and delta precipitation can also increase soil moisture and wash salt from the soil elmore et al 2006 these factors contribute to better vegetation coverage and diversity vegetation establishment is an effective way to prevent salty sand and dust storms which is conducive to solving ecological environmental problems schachtsiek et al 2014 kim et al 2020 with persistent decline of the south aral sea a salinized desert is formed in the east aralkum desert which is the main salt and dust storms source affecting the entire surrounding area from the 1960s to the 1980s the salinity of the exposed seabed soil was low through leaching the soil became sandy and the vegetation developed with better coverage however from the 1990s to 2010s the water salinity showed a dramatic increase from 30 g l to 290 g l consequently this led to a high soil salt content in the exposed seabed during that period marsh solonchaks coastal solonchaks and dry solonchaks are widely distributed in this area kozhoridze et al 2012 although hyperhalophytic plants can colonize the dry seafloor they are sparse and difficult to develop over time it was reported that the soil salinity began to decrease in the exposed seabed of the 1990s through afforestation after 14 years an et al 2020 notably the exposed soil salinity was lower in the 1990s than in the 2000s and the 2010s with increasing soil salinity afforestation becomes more difficult and time consuming if the soil type changes from severely saline soil to sandy soil and becomes favorable for general desert vegetation growth by natural processes this process will take a long time even if the leaching process exists an et al 2018 therefore allowing more freshwater to flow into the eastern basin as well as increasing the low salinity water level will be an effective and faster way of increasing soil moisture decreasing soil salinity and mobilizing soil nutrients elmore et al 2006 this will make the exposed seabed favorable for vegetation development and reduce the damage from salty storms in a short time if the issue of water level recovery is not considered the exposed seabed area during the period 1990s 2010s in the eastern basin may remain a saline desert for a long period in the future 4 4 quantifying the hydrological impacts the riparian vegetation is affected by precipitation the groundwater table and water salinity the groundwater level has a significant impact on the lake water level and salinity in this study we assume that the groundwater table in the dry seabed zone can be approximated by the lake water level moreover the lake water level and salinity are easy to acquire conceptually the relationship between ndvi and its influencing factors can be expressed by the following 1 ndvi f s w l p where s is the lake water salinity wl is the water level and p is precipitation as discussed in previous sections the extinct dtw was estimated as 7 8 m therefore using the pearson correlation equations pearson 1920 we conducted a correlation analysis between ndvi and water level precipitation and salinity with regard to a dtw of less than 7 8 m in the three basins of the aral sea we used the averaged ndvi of the corresponding dtw for each 1 m elevation band the statistical results are presented in table 2 the correlation coefficients between ndvi and wl salinity were 0 80 and 0 64 respectively which is higher than that between ndvi and precipitation meanwhile the principal component analysis was used and the results were displayed in fig 8 it indicated that the gwl and s were the main components for the change in vegetation growth on the exposed lakebed according to the statistics water level and salinity were significant p 0 01 factors influencing ndvi however precipitation was not a significant influencing factor when the dtw was less than 7 8 m we plotted the salt content of the lake water against the dwater level in fig 9 a a regression analysis revealed the following relationship between salt content and water level 2 s 4 41 10 7 w l 3 81 thus equation 2 was reduced to a single dimension wl a regression analysis determined the following formula for equation 3 3 ndvi 57 5 wl 100 7 4 the ndvi values against water level as well as the fitted curve are plotted in fig 9b we observed a significant p less than 0 01 positive correlation r 0 84 between ndvi and water level then ndvi was estimated by the formula 3 and the ndvi derived from landsat data and estimated ndvi changes are shown in fig 10 indicating a good distribution along the 1 1 line based on recent studies gorji et al 2015 wang et al 2019 the model was the most effective with reliable prediction when the ratio of performance to deviation rpd was more than 2 00 the rpd was 2 23 and the r2 was 0 80 with a relatively low root mean square error rmse of 0 01 in the model indicating that the model had high estimation performance if the assumption is accepted that the groundwater level in the dry seabed area can be approximated by the lake level under the conditions that in situ data on groundwater is lack this relationship may be useful for lake water level management specifically with regard to vegetation development in the exposed seafloor 5 conclusions this study analyzed the spatial and temporal changes in ndvi in the exposed seafloor of the aral sea we quantitatively determined the effects of precipitation the groundwater table and water salinity on ndvi and the findings can be summarized as follows 1 the ndvi in the retreat area displayed an overall increase from 1986 to 2020 the increasing vegetated area accounted for 84 of the area in the south aral sea which was caused by an increase in the exposed lakebed area however the increasing vegetated area accounted for approximately 40 of the area in the north aral sea due to the improved water environment 2 when the dtw was larger than 7 8 m vegetation development was more dependent on precipitation than groundwater however when the dtw was less than 7 8 m groundwater had a more significant impact than precipitation on vegetation development we believe that the negative impacts of groundwater salinity exceed the positive contributions of water supply on vegetation development this differs to the common understanding of vegetation dtw relationships under conditions of fresh or brackish groundwater in arid climates 3 increasing freshwater flow into the eastern basin and then increasing the low salinity water level could be an effective and rapid way of enhancing vegetation development on the dry seafloor if the issue of water level recovery is not considered the exposed seabed area in the eastern basin during the period 1990s 2010s may remain a saline desert for a long period in the future 4 with regard to the minor influence of precipitation on vegetation when dtw was less than 7 8 m as well as the close relationship between salt content and lake level we established an empirical relationship between ndvi and water level which may be used for lake water level management that considers vegetation development in the retreated area of the aral sea notably this study assumed that the groundwater table and salt content in the retreated area can be approximated by the lake water level and salt content respectively these simplifications were assumed because of the unavailability of in situ observation data of both the water table and groundwater salt content in the retreat area of the aral sea this may have caused some uncertainties in the results but it is relatively difficult to quantitatively address credit authorship contribution statement zihao duan performed the research and

2947,the aral sea has been persistently shrinking in past decades and the influence of the lake water level changes on vegetation in the lake retreat areas is uncertain in this study we quantitatively assessed the vegetation development due to relevant hydrological changes in the retreat area of the aral sea the results showed that the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi in the retreat area displayed an overall increase from 1986 to 2020 the increasing vegetated area accounted for 84 of the total area of the south aral sea which was caused by an increase in the exposed lakebed area however about 40 of the area in the north aral sea was the increasing vegetated area due to the improved water environment when the depth to water table dtw was larger than 7 8 m vegetation development was more dependent on precipitation than groundwater when dtw was less than 7 8 m groundwater had a more significant impact than precipitation on vegetation development the negative impacts of groundwater salinity exceed the positive contributions of water supply on vegetation development which differs to the common understanding under conditions of fresh or brackish groundwater in arid climates water level recovery is an effective option for improving vegetation establishment on the exposed seabed otherwise the exposed seabed area observed during the period 1990s 2010s in the eastern basin may remain a saline desert for a long period in the future finally an empirical relationship between ndvi and water levels was established which can be used for lake water level management that considers vegetation development in the retreated area of the aral sea keywords aral sea vegetation dynamics ndvi depth to water table salinity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction groundwater may be a dominant water supply for vegetation in terrestrial ecosystems around the world especially in regions where precipitation is scarce and groundwater occurs at shallow depths fan et al 2013 the water source for vegetation growth and distribution is mainly derived from precipitation surface runoff and groundwater zeng et al 2020 in arid and semi arid regions low precipitation with high evapotranspiration and limited surface runoff do not provide sufficient water for vegetation growth xia et al 2016 groundwater often becomes an important water source especially for riparian and littoral plants lamontagne et al 2005 in the last few decades many large lakes worldwide have experienced persistent shrinkage wurtsbaugh et al 2017 leading to a decline in the groundwater level in the riparian zone gross 2017 degraded riparian zones due to lake shrinking often cause ecological and environmental damage to vegetation growth biodiversity landscape aesthetic values and water and land quality they also seriously threaten the health and safety of the local population around the lake coops et al 2004 soil water salinity and the depth to water table dtw are considered the dominant driving factors of these damages the buried depth of groundwater influences the upward flow that replenishes soil water which in turn influences the uptake of water by plant roots sutton and price 2020 the deeper the water table the more difficult it is for plants to uptake soil water recharged by groundwater via capillaries musa et al 2019 yan and guo 2019 groundwater drawdowns may even result in cyclic succession and regression patterns of riparian vegetation van and van der valk 1981 the coverage and abundance of riparian plants were found to decrease with decreasing groundwater table depth such as in lower reaches of the tarim river northwest china chen et al 2014 the gradual decline of groundwater resulted in the succession of vegetation communities from wetland to drought resistant types and even to bare land yang et al 2019 with regard to the close relations between vegetation and groundwater spatial patterns of groundwater relevant vegetation communities and coverage have been widely studied chui et al 2011 jin et al 2014 zhu et al 2015 bhanja et al 2019 it is generally recognized that a declining water table causes vegetation to change from aquatic and mesophytic herbs to xerophytic and sandy shrubs cui and shao 2005 salinity is also an important factor influencing the vegetation groundwater interactions in arid regions salt in groundwater migrates upward to the soil profile through capillary rise and accumulates in the surface layer due to evaporation this is critically the case in the upward dominant arid and semi arid regions where evaporative demand far exceeds precipitation the higher the salt content in groundwater the shallower the water table the drier the climate and the greater the risks of salt accumulation abliz et al 2016 haj amor et al 2017 resulting in more harmful effects on the establishment and development of vegetation ondrasek and rengel 2020 excess salinity could impair the growth of plants and further threaten their survival kang 2004 groundwater salinity may therefore play a dominant role in shaping the spatial patterns of plant communities in arid regions khan et al 1976 cardinale 2011 gonzález alcaraz et al 2014 xi et al 2016 due to the decline of the aral sea the once submerged lakebed is now exposed to an arid climate resulting in ecological environmental and human health consequences wæhler and dietrichs 2017 the water level of the sea decreased from 53 4 m above sea level asl in 1960 to 42 5 m in the north aral sea 23 3 m in the western basin and 26 4 m in the eastern basin of the south aral sea in 2020 cawater 2021 water level decline caused an exposed lakebed area of approximately 60112 km2 micklin 2014 shrinkage of the water body caused a significant increase in salt content from 10 6 g l in 1960 to 220 2 g l in 2008 in the eastern basin and 193 5 g l in 2019 in the western basin kuz mina and treshkin 2009 aladin et al 2019 however the salt content decreased to 5 8 g l in 2019 in the north aral sea in response to water recovery the current low salt content in the north aral sea is due to the restoration of water levels and water bodies through runoff recharge from syr darya due to the establishment of the kokaral dam in kazakhstan in 2005 aladin et al 2018 pioneer plant species colonized on the dry seafloor in response to the sea shrinkage wucherer and breckle 2001 breckle 2020 a few euryhaline species have been identified and different plant communities have developed micklin et al 2020 the water level decrease formed vegetation successions from hydrophytic and low salt tolerant species to xerophilic and highly salt tolerant species dimeyeva 2007 shomurodov et al 2021 floristic investigations since the 1960 s identified floristic successions namely psammoseres haloseres and potamoseres dimeyeva 2015 the successions were affected by hydrological regimes soil texture and salinity dimeyeva 2015 shomurodov et al 2021 the sea shrinkage and salinization caused a decrease in hydromorphic vegetation a disappearance in the thickets of freshwater pondweeds and most riparian tugay forests and a gradual replacement of freshwater plants with halotolerant plants aladin et al 1998 the vegetation on the exposed lakebed of the south aral sea has been significantly degraded resulting in salt dust storms and respiratory diseases wæhler and dietrichs 2017 restoration of vegetation cover is considered an important method for solving the ecological and environmental problems in the aral sea region which is limited by hydrodynamic conditions and soil properties on the dry seafloor an et al 2020 kim et al 2020 a quantitative understanding of the relationships between vegetation and hydrological regimes is fundamental to vegetation restoration in this region earlier studies investigated the temporal and spatial changes in vegetation in the exposed lakebed of the aral sea smimov 1875 wucherer 1979 wucherer et al 2001 breckle et al 1998 breckle 2013 kamalov et al 2001 dimeyeva 2007 2015 shomurodov and adilov 2019 shomurodov et al 2021 however quantitative descriptions of the changes in hydrological forcing are still insufficient precipitation and groundwater are the main sources of soil moisture for vegetation in the retreat area as identified by aladin et al 2009 the effects of a decreased groundwater table and increased salinity on ecosystems as a result of lake regression should not be ignored the aims of this paper were to 1 evaluate the temporal and spatial variability of vegetation cover and 2 quantitatively explore the effects of hydrological regimes and salinity on vegetation development in the retreat area of the aral sea 2 study area this study focused on the exposed seabed of the aral sea since 1960 the aral sea is the terminal lake of the amu and syr darya in central asia fig 1 before the 1960s it was the fourth largest inland water body in the world and its area was 68900 km2 micklin 2014 its steep west coast is located on the eastern edge of the ustyurt plateau 150 m above the lake the karakum desert is located to the southwest and the kyzylkum desert is located to the northeast before 1960 the lake had a length of 426 km from north to south and a width of 284 km from east to west its mean depth is 16 m with a maximum depth of 69 m micklin 2007 cawater 2021 due to the characteristics of the vast area shallow depth water body it is thus very sensitive to water level fluctuations the aral sea region experiences a continental climate rainfall is scarce and atmospheric demand is high the average annual precipitation is less than 250 mm and the potential annual evaporation varies from 800 mm to 1300 mm shen et al 2019 kim et al 2020 the temperature increases from north to south with a monthly average minimum of 12 c to 0 c in january and a maximum of 24 c to 32 c in july the aral sea declined sharply since the 1960 s which was attributed to a remarkable reduction in inflow from the amu and syr darya rivers micklin 2014 the reduction was mainly caused by water withdrawal for irrigation bortnik 1999 cretaux et al 2013 the long term negative water balance resulted in the extensive retreat of the lake in 1989 the lake was divided into two water bodies the north aral sea and the south aral sea izhitskiy et al 2016 in 2003 the south split into the eastern and western basins which are hydraulically connected to each other sometimes ge et al 2016 in the early 1990s the kokaral dam was constructed between the south and north aral sea the south receives water from the amu darya and the north receives water from the syr darya specifically the water level in the north aral sea has recovered to 41 43 m asl since 2005 the level in the south aral sea continued to decline until the 2010 s the remaining area ratio of the aral sea was only 12 or 8 2 103 km2 in 2020 and 6 9 104 km2 in 1960 the water level declined from 53 4 m asl in 1960 to 42 5 m asl north aral sea 23 3 m asl west of south aral sea and 26 4 m asl east of south aral sea in 2020 the salt concentration increased significantly during the retreat the inter annual variations in water level and salt concentrations are discussed in detail in the following sections 3 materials and methods 3 1 data 3 1 1 climate few observational data are available for the study area zavialov 2005 we therefore used the precipitation dataset of the climatic research unit cru ts v 4 05 https crudata uea ac uk cru data hrg as the alternative the annual precipitation data used in this study spanned from 1986 to 2020 with a spatial resolution of 0 5 previous studies have indicated that the cru dataset exhibits good performance in central asia wang et al 2020 yang et al 2020 3 1 2 vegetation cover the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi was used to describe vegetation cover in the study area the details about ndvi calculated from the satellite information can be found in rouse et al 1974 the landsat 4 5 7 8 images from 1986 to 2020 were used to derive the ndvi maps the images had a temporal resolution of 16 days and a spatial resolution of 30 m the landsat datasets used in this study were archived in the google earth engine gee platform the data processing was performed by using the javascript programming language on the google earth engine platform https earthengine google com we derived the ndvi in the growth season from april to october gessner et al 2013 li et al 2015 jiang et al 2017 the median ndvi value for each growth season was used as the representative of the year the retreat area was defined as the exposed lakebed of the aral sea since 1960 it was delineated into elevation zones with equal contour intervals of 1 m ndvi varies within the zones the frequency distribution of ndvi for each elevation zone was analyzed and is shown in supplementary figs 1 3 for simplicity the mean ndvi values within each elevation zone were used in the following analysis the same statistical method was applied by lv et al 2013 3 1 3 groundwater table and salinity observations of the groundwater table are important information for the analysis in this study however few measurements are readily available for use in the retreated area of the aral sea pan et al 2020 previous studies have found that the groundwater table fluctuations in riparian zones were primarily controlled by water level variations in the respective lakes wahyuni et al 2009 li et al 2018 javadzadeh et al 2020 such as the positive correlation coefficients determined in poyang lake 0 96 li et al 2018 and the lake urmia basin 0 95 javadzadeh et al 2020 moreover some studies used the lake water table as an alternative to the groundwater table in riparian areas vesipa et al 2016 monitoring data of the water level in the aral sea is readily available singh et al 2018 and was used as a proxy for the groundwater table in this study moreover we assume that the salt content in the groundwater is the same as that in the lake annual water levels for the period 1986 2020 were acquired from the portal of knowledge for water and environmental issues in central asia http www cawater info net the salt content dataset was compiled from relevant studies keith et al 2013 gaybullaev et al 2014 aladin et al 2018 2019 and field expeditions in 2019 the sampling sites are shown in fig 1 3 1 4 digital elevation model dem depths to the groundwater table were derived from topographic maps and the groundwater table which uses the lake water level as a proxy the topographic map for the exposed lakebed before 2000 is based on the dem map of the space shuttle radar terrain mission srtm data released by the u s geological survey in 2018 with a 30 m spatial resolution the horizontal datum plane in the geographical coordinate system adopts the wgs84 coordinate system and the vertical datum plane egm96 the data for the lakebed that became exposed from the water after 2000 are based on a 1 500000 topographic map of the aral sea bottom through on boat detection in the 1960s benduhn and renard 2004 the map used the same projection systems as the dem and was gridded to 30 m 3 2 analysis methods 3 2 1 trend analysis inter annual change trends of ndvi series were detected by the non parametric mann kendall m k test and sen s slope mann 1945 kendall 1975 the method is widely used and described in detail in many studies machiwal and jha 2012 şen 2017 the slope of a linear trend is estimated by a nonparametric method proposed by sen 1968 which is widely used to estimate the annual change rate of meteorological and hydrological variations shah and mishra 2016 zhu et al 2019 pan et al 2020 3 2 2 correlation analysis the pearson correlation coefficient r was applied to evaluate the regression relationship between ndvi and dtw and the details about the method can be found in precious studies pearson 1920 yuan et al 2015 pan et al 2020 3 2 3 principal component analysis in order to identify the main component for the changes in vegetation growth on the exposed lakebed of the aral sea the principal component analysis pca was employed to explore the most influential parameters ringnér 2008 page et al 2012 3 2 4 establishing ndvi dtw relations the retreat area was delineated into elevation bands with an equal interval of 1 m on the topographic map when an elevation band was located above the lake level statistical analysis of the ndvi values was performed when the water level was located within a band the statistical analysis was performed with respect to the exposed portion the analysis was performed with regard to three portions of the split aral sea the north aral sea the east and west basins of the south as shown in fig 1 to assess the effects of dtw changes on vegetation every 1 m dtw interval was employed to obtain a set of corresponding ndvi values then to facilitate analysis the arithmetic mean of each group of ndvi values was calculated to obtain an ndvi value in this way the ndvi values for different groundwater depths were calculated every year finally the corresponding annual ndvi at 1 m dtw intervals in the retreat area from the water level to 52 m asl was calculated from 1986 to 2020 in the three portions of the aral sea in the analysis the ndvi was averaged for every five years discussed in section 4 3 1 4 results and discussion 4 1 spatial distributions of vegetation in 2020 the vegetation status in 2020 indicated by the ndvi over the exposed seabed is shown in fig 2 vegetation cover in the delta areas of two rivers was the highest in this study area tugaic vegetation was formed in these regions micklin et al 2020 where the relatively high groundwater table low salinity and frequent periodic floods are favorable for plants ndvi values decreased toward the sea indicating a decrease in vegetation coverage meanwhile the ndvi values indicate denser vegetation cover on vozrozhdeniya island and in the belt along the southern coastline during the 1960 s where floristic diversity has always been rich shomurodov and adilov 2019 a previous qualitative analysis concluded that successions occurred mainly due to changes in hydrological regimes dimeyeva 2015 vegetation development is subjected to different hydrodynamic conditions and soil salinity the exposed soil salinity showed an upward trend from the older coastline to the present one due to the recession duan et al 2022 the soil salinity also plays an important role in vegetation colonization and development an et al 2018 in this study ndvi will be used as a proxy of vegetation status to quantitatively analyze vegetation development in response to ground water decrease and salinity increase with time since the 1980s 4 2 intra and inter annual variations of ndvi 4 2 1 intra annual variations averaged over each five years from 1986 to 2020 the mean ndvi values over the exposed seabed area within the typical elevation range of 41 52 m asl are depicted in fig 3 and the monthly ndvi changes for each elevation band individually can be found in the supplementary fig 4 seasonally the ndvi firstly peaked in early june and late july and reached its minimum in january the seasonal distribution follows that of temperature and precipitation in this region the seasonal hydrologic regime significantly affected vegetation changes an increase in soil moisture promoted the growth of vegetation during spring and summer soil salinity and texture are also important factors that affect flora and vegetation development breckle 2013 in the following analysis the median ndvi values from april to october were used to represent the seasonal vegetation variability 4 2 2 change trends of ndvi since 1986 the changing trends and the slopes of the pixel ndvi values from 1986 to 2020 are mapped in fig 4 generally the vegetation cover increased or remained stable in the study region table 1 however ndvi showed some decreases as shown by the red colored portions in fig 4 but the percentage area was small the decreasing portions are located in deltas of amu and syr darya rivers and in the belt along the initial shoreline in the south aral sea this region with the highest vegetation coverage in 2020 as described in the previous section in fact vegetation has developed to the current state along a timeline of floristic successions and vegetation cover development since the early 1960s which were jointly affected by precipitation decreasing groundwater levels and increasing depth to groundwater and water salinity 4 3 impacts of hydrological regimes on ndvi changes the exposed lakebed of the aral sea is a natural laboratory of vegetation succession wucherer and breckle 2001 vegetation grows with the intervention of groundwater variations and soil salinity which shows different patterns in the exposed lakebed of the aral sea from the common understanding mentioned above in the early 1960s the aral sea began to retreat the lakebed began to emerge from the water and pioneer plant species began to grow on the exposed seafloor since then successions of vegetations lasted almost 60 years and the main vegetation changed from initial hydrophytic vegetation to xerophilic and hyperhalophytic vegetation dimeyeva 2015 shomurodov et al 2021 over the past 60 years the south aral sea has continued to retreat and the seabed synchronously became more exposed resulting in newly exposed elevation bands interestingly different episodes of vegetation succession were observed in different zones of the exposed seabed this suggests that the primary succession of plants on the dry seabed was attributed to changes in hydrological regimes and soil salinity dimeyeva 2015 4 3 1 relationship between ndvi and the depth to water table dtw due to the unavailability of measurements we assume that the groundwater table is approximated the lake water level due to the relatively flat terrain of the exposed lakebed the dtw was thus estimated as the difference between the elevations of the exposed lakebed and the lake water level this assumption may be problematic which will be discussed later the pixel based ndvi values were first averaged over each five year period from 1986 and then over each elevation band the dtw was divided into 1 m intervals in order to analyze the relationship between vegetation development and dtw the ndvi and corresponding dtw for each elevation band are plotted in fig 5 the tails of the curves for each 5 year period indicate the lake water level and thus the groundwater level at that time vegetation has improved since 1986 in the retreated area around the three sub water bodies the ndvi changes with dtw are similar on the exposed seabed of the eastern fig 5a and western fig 5b basins of the south aral sea but are quite different to that of the north fig 5c in the south aral sea ndvi increased with increasing dtw since 1986 for the north aral sea the ndvi decreased with dtw to some extent and then increased with deeper dtw it is commonly understood that vegetation depends on groundwater in arid areas and the deeper the depth to groundwater the harder it is for plants to utilize water lv et al 2013 yang et al 2019 vegetation grow in arid and semi arid areas that rely on precipitation and or groundwater hao et al 2010 zhu et al 2015 and groundwater is usually the main water source lamontagne et al 2005 hao et al 2010 however when groundwater is buried too deep precipitation may become the only source of water for vegetation elmore et al 2006 nezlin et al 2005 jiang et al 2017 these interpretations are mainly based on the predominantly stable floristic communities and fresh or brackish groundwater this observation in the aral sea is uncommon as it differs to the typical understanding of the vegetation groundwater relationship in other arid areas fig 5 the use of groundwater by plants may cease at some dtw the extinct dtw varies among plant types stand ages soil properties such as hydraulic conductivity and climate eamus et al 2016 sperry and hacke 2002 similar to the arid climate in the aral sea region groundwater dominates the water source for herb and shrub vegetation in the lower tarim river and heihe river in northwest china the plant species richness in the tarim river basin is alike to that in the aral sea basin novikova 2001 zeng et al 2019 it has been reported that the extinct dtw for most tree shrub and herb vegetation was approximately 6 m in the tarim river hao et al 2010 zeng et al 2019 2020 and 5 6 m in the heihe river wang et al 2011 the exposed lakebed of aral sea is dominated by shrubs such as haloxylon aphyllum with an average maximum root depth of about 7 m fan et al 2017 wucherer et al 2001 also herbs grow in this area such as salsola ruthenica with an average maximum root depth of about 2 m the extinct dtw for the riparian vegetation of the aral sea has scarcely been reported in earlier studies we estimated it to be at 7 8 m below the ground as shown in fig 5c above which the ndvi increases with decreasing dtw for the southern parts of the aral sea extinct dtws cannot be identified from the ndvi dtw curves in fig 5a and b however they were roughly estimated to be the same as those in the north aral sea as mentioned in the earlier section the ndvi dtw relationship differs to the common knowledge of this relationship in arid regions to address these issues four representative elevation bands were selected to investigate the ndvi and its attributing factors as shown in fig 6 elevation bands i iii are located on the exposed seabed of the south aral sea i along the original coastline in the 1960 s and the island and ii around the water body of the western basin and iii eastern basin elevation iv is located around the water body of the north aral sea their dtws can be categorized into two groups i more than 7 8 m and ii iv less than 7 8 m the relationships between ndvi and precipitation p and groundwater level gwl for representative elevation bands are presented in fig 7 in addition the salt content groundwater level relationships are also presented for the three water bodies in fig 7 notably we assume that the groundwater salt content is synchronous with that in the water body 4 3 2 precipitation and groundwater our results demonstrate that ndvi increases with increasing precipitation regardless of the water body location elevation bands and dtws fig 7a d and g the annual precipitation was only approximately 150 mm from 1986 to 2020 and the ndvi varied according to the inter annual variation of precipitation the effect of rainfall on vegetation growth becomes more significant when the groundwater is too deep jiang et al 2017 elmore et al 2006 haloxerophytic grasslands and shrubby plants can utilize rainfall during the growing season for their development wucherer et al 2001 wesche and ronnenberg 2010 regression analysis inferred a significant correlation p 0 05 when dtw was more than 7 8 m indicating that precipitation acted a significant role in vegetation growth in the eastern and western basins when dtw was less than 7 8 m the impact of precipitation on ndvi was not significant for the north aral sea precipitation significantly contributed to the ndvi increase regardless of the dtw and the effect was more significant p 0 01 for dtws greater than 7 8 m than for those equivalent to 7 8 m it can be concluded from the above analysis that ndvi development in the original coastline region depends on precipitation rather than the groundwater contribution precipitation infiltrates into the soil and supplies vegetation through soil moisture hence in this case the soil moisture contribution remains significant dtw shows more impact than precipitation when dtw is less than 7 8 m see fig 7b e and h in the south aral sea the ndvi in the eastern basin fig 7b and western basin fig 7e increases with decreasing groundwater level and thus increasing depth to groundwater this is contrary to the typical understanding of the vegetation groundwater relations in arid regions where vegetation growth is promoted when the groundwater table is shallower however in the north aral sea the ndvi dtw relation follows the typical understanding of this relationship the groundwater level has shown an upward trend in recent years the lake water salt content decreased to 5 8 g l in 2019 in response to groundwater level recovery aladin et al 2019 accordingly groundwater salinity has been low in recent years the lower groundwater and soil salinity produced favorable conditions for vegetation growth it is worth noting that vegetation development in areas with high soil moisture maybe not always good supplementary figs 5 6 it is limited by soil salinity and growth time around the water surface in the south aral sea although the soil moisture is higher the ndvi is lower this is due to the impact of high groundwater and soil salinity which makes it harder for vegetation to colonize and develop on this area 4 3 3 salinity the aral sea has been a saline lake during the 1960s the single water body had an average salt content of 10 6 g l it is an inland lake with no outlets salt is transported to the lake via the recharge of syr and amu darya rivers the water is removed because of surface evaporation while the salt remains these processes describe the general water and salt balances of the lake consequently the water bodies become increasingly saline as the lake retreats the north and the south aral sea separated in 1989 then a dam between the two parts was constructed in 2005 izhitskiy et al 2016 the south aral sea was divided into two basins in 2003 ge et al 2016 the different water bodies have different water and salt balancing processes owing to the differences in water input fig 7c and f show the changes in salt content with decreasing groundwater level for the eastern and western basins respectively and fig 7i shows the groundwater level rise in the north aral sea the increasing ndvi with a deepening groundwater table in the eastern fig 7b and western fig 7e basins may be explained by the intertwined salt impacts it is well known that soils under salinity stress will inhibit the growth of plants and impair their production tuteja 2007 the salinity stress will lead to the accumulation of ionic toxicity e g na cl in plants osmotic pressure imbalance and oxidative damage thus limiting the absorption of soil water and nutrients shrivastava and kumar 2015 consequently it causes damage to plants and then produces negative effects on the environment the increasing salinity will cause the degradation of freshwater plants which were replaced by more salt tolerant plant communities and further plant species and density changes fagherazzi et al 2019 soil salinity will also affect the seed germination colonized species and growth rate of plants woods et al 2020 the negative impacts of salt content is likely to exceed the positive impacts of groundwater contribution to vegetation development the increase in lake water salinity led to the soil salinization of the dry seafloor shen et al 2019 as the water level drops the salt contained in the lake water remains in the exposed seabed soils consequently most of the exposed lakebed was dominated by sandy deposits which accumulated up to 10 12 of salts stulina and sektimenko 2004 the higher the salt content of the water the higher the salt content in the soil profile as a result the exposed soil salinity exhibited an upward trend from the former to the present shoreline in the south aral sea vegetation began to colonize the dry bed and natural succession was initiated successions of floristic communities and species were driven by soil water availability soil texture and soil salinity the vegetation cover developed under the forcing of precipitation fig 7a d and g and the combined effects of groundwater contribution and soil salinity fig 7b c e f and h i soil salinity stress has a negative effect on vegetation growth shrivastava and kumar 2015 pang et al 2010 tian et al 2020 thus the vegetation cover showed a downward trend from the older coastal line to the present one fig 5a b under the condition of less saline groundwater such as in lower reaches of the heihe and tarim rivers the plant use of groundwater decreased with increasing dtw and extinguished at approximately 6 m below the ground this was also found in the exposed seafloor of the north aral sea where the extinct dtw was approximately 7 8 m the ground water salt content was reported as 0 5 35 g l and 0 4 35 g l in lower reaches of the tarim river xu et al 2014 and heihe river wen et al 2005 respectively comparatively the salt content of the north aral sea varied within the range of 5 8 29 6 g l fig 7i however the situations for the eastern and western basins were quite different for example when the representative elevation bands 33 34 m asl and 29 30 m asl became exposed from the water the corresponding water salt contents were 62 g l fig 7c and 112 g l fig 7f respectively thereafter the eastern and western basins continued to decline and the salt content continued to increase to approximately 260 g l and 193 g l respectively the hypersaline groundwater and consequently the high soil salt content should have had a more negative than positive contribution to vegetation growth moreover the negative impacts decreased as the groundwater table decreased therefore ndvi increased with deeper dtw fig 5a b in the north aral sea the ndvi began to increase when the dtw was more than 7 8 m fig 5c correspondingly these were mainly located in areas with low soil salinity and well developed vegetation such as vozrozhdeniya island and delta precipitation can also increase soil moisture and wash salt from the soil elmore et al 2006 these factors contribute to better vegetation coverage and diversity vegetation establishment is an effective way to prevent salty sand and dust storms which is conducive to solving ecological environmental problems schachtsiek et al 2014 kim et al 2020 with persistent decline of the south aral sea a salinized desert is formed in the east aralkum desert which is the main salt and dust storms source affecting the entire surrounding area from the 1960s to the 1980s the salinity of the exposed seabed soil was low through leaching the soil became sandy and the vegetation developed with better coverage however from the 1990s to 2010s the water salinity showed a dramatic increase from 30 g l to 290 g l consequently this led to a high soil salt content in the exposed seabed during that period marsh solonchaks coastal solonchaks and dry solonchaks are widely distributed in this area kozhoridze et al 2012 although hyperhalophytic plants can colonize the dry seafloor they are sparse and difficult to develop over time it was reported that the soil salinity began to decrease in the exposed seabed of the 1990s through afforestation after 14 years an et al 2020 notably the exposed soil salinity was lower in the 1990s than in the 2000s and the 2010s with increasing soil salinity afforestation becomes more difficult and time consuming if the soil type changes from severely saline soil to sandy soil and becomes favorable for general desert vegetation growth by natural processes this process will take a long time even if the leaching process exists an et al 2018 therefore allowing more freshwater to flow into the eastern basin as well as increasing the low salinity water level will be an effective and faster way of increasing soil moisture decreasing soil salinity and mobilizing soil nutrients elmore et al 2006 this will make the exposed seabed favorable for vegetation development and reduce the damage from salty storms in a short time if the issue of water level recovery is not considered the exposed seabed area during the period 1990s 2010s in the eastern basin may remain a saline desert for a long period in the future 4 4 quantifying the hydrological impacts the riparian vegetation is affected by precipitation the groundwater table and water salinity the groundwater level has a significant impact on the lake water level and salinity in this study we assume that the groundwater table in the dry seabed zone can be approximated by the lake water level moreover the lake water level and salinity are easy to acquire conceptually the relationship between ndvi and its influencing factors can be expressed by the following 1 ndvi f s w l p where s is the lake water salinity wl is the water level and p is precipitation as discussed in previous sections the extinct dtw was estimated as 7 8 m therefore using the pearson correlation equations pearson 1920 we conducted a correlation analysis between ndvi and water level precipitation and salinity with regard to a dtw of less than 7 8 m in the three basins of the aral sea we used the averaged ndvi of the corresponding dtw for each 1 m elevation band the statistical results are presented in table 2 the correlation coefficients between ndvi and wl salinity were 0 80 and 0 64 respectively which is higher than that between ndvi and precipitation meanwhile the principal component analysis was used and the results were displayed in fig 8 it indicated that the gwl and s were the main components for the change in vegetation growth on the exposed lakebed according to the statistics water level and salinity were significant p 0 01 factors influencing ndvi however precipitation was not a significant influencing factor when the dtw was less than 7 8 m we plotted the salt content of the lake water against the dwater level in fig 9 a a regression analysis revealed the following relationship between salt content and water level 2 s 4 41 10 7 w l 3 81 thus equation 2 was reduced to a single dimension wl a regression analysis determined the following formula for equation 3 3 ndvi 57 5 wl 100 7 4 the ndvi values against water level as well as the fitted curve are plotted in fig 9b we observed a significant p less than 0 01 positive correlation r 0 84 between ndvi and water level then ndvi was estimated by the formula 3 and the ndvi derived from landsat data and estimated ndvi changes are shown in fig 10 indicating a good distribution along the 1 1 line based on recent studies gorji et al 2015 wang et al 2019 the model was the most effective with reliable prediction when the ratio of performance to deviation rpd was more than 2 00 the rpd was 2 23 and the r2 was 0 80 with a relatively low root mean square error rmse of 0 01 in the model indicating that the model had high estimation performance if the assumption is accepted that the groundwater level in the dry seabed area can be approximated by the lake level under the conditions that in situ data on groundwater is lack this relationship may be useful for lake water level management specifically with regard to vegetation development in the exposed seafloor 5 conclusions this study analyzed the spatial and temporal changes in ndvi in the exposed seafloor of the aral sea we quantitatively determined the effects of precipitation the groundwater table and water salinity on ndvi and the findings can be summarized as follows 1 the ndvi in the retreat area displayed an overall increase from 1986 to 2020 the increasing vegetated area accounted for 84 of the area in the south aral sea which was caused by an increase in the exposed lakebed area however the increasing vegetated area accounted for approximately 40 of the area in the north aral sea due to the improved water environment 2 when the dtw was larger than 7 8 m vegetation development was more dependent on precipitation than groundwater however when the dtw was less than 7 8 m groundwater had a more significant impact than precipitation on vegetation development we believe that the negative impacts of groundwater salinity exceed the positive contributions of water supply on vegetation development this differs to the common understanding of vegetation dtw relationships under conditions of fresh or brackish groundwater in arid climates 3 increasing freshwater flow into the eastern basin and then increasing the low salinity water level could be an effective and rapid way of enhancing vegetation development on the dry seafloor if the issue of water level recovery is not considered the exposed seabed area in the eastern basin during the period 1990s 2010s may remain a saline desert for a long period in the future 4 with regard to the minor influence of precipitation on vegetation when dtw was less than 7 8 m as well as the close relationship between salt content and lake level we established an empirical relationship between ndvi and water level which may be used for lake water level management that considers vegetation development in the retreated area of the aral sea notably this study assumed that the groundwater table and salt content in the retreated area can be approximated by the lake water level and salt content respectively these simplifications were assumed because of the unavailability of in situ observation data of both the water table and groundwater salt content in the retreat area of the aral sea this may have caused some uncertainties in the results but it is relatively difficult to quantitatively address credit authorship contribution statement zihao duan performed the research and

2948,identifying the environmental factors controlling deep soil water and nitrate is important for the sustainability of vegetation and ecosystems however the combined effects of multiple factors at varying scales have been poorly understood especially in those regions with thick vadose zones and deep rooted plants the aim of this study is to identify the multivariate controls of water and nitrate in seven 13 m deep boreholes under different land use types on china s loess plateau after measuring soil water and nitrate contents the combined effects of climatic factors precipitation temperature and potential evapotranspiration and soil properties soil texture magnetic susceptibility ph ec and soil organic carbon were explored by wavelet analysis land use is the key factor

and nitrate variability and further has significant impacts on groundwater recharge and water quality huang et al 2018 huang et al 2021 in addition to vegetation the variations of soil water and nitrate are closely controlled by climate topography soil type and their interactions dekker et al 2007 jackson et al 2004 as such it is essential to reveal the variations and controlling factors of water and nitrate for the sustainability of vegetation and ecosystems the predominant environmental factors of soil water and nitrate reservoirs vary with different scales and depths jiao et al 2021 padilla et al 2018 wang et al 2020 specifically soil texture greatly contributes to soil water infiltration at the field and catchment scales while climatic factors atmospheric circulation and geographical location dominate soil water movement at the regional and global scales gu et al 2021 li et al 2021 for instance it takes longer for soil water to move downwards in soils with higher clay and silt contents moreover nitrate inputs are largely controlled by anthropogenic activities such as fertilization regimes and tillage system fan et al 2010 gao et al 2019 soil water plays an indispensable role in transport processes of nutrient and or pollutant additionally soil n cycle is mostly driven by microorganisms whose survival and growth greatly depend on soil nutrient

information for hydrological and biogeochemical cycles in the thick loess deposits the objectives of this study are to identify the multivariate controls of water and nitrate in thick loess deposits under different land use types specifically we try to answer the following questions i how do soil water and nitrate contents relate to land use ii how do multiple environmental factors combine to

selected to be drilled in august 2017 table 1 they shared the similar climate soil and hydrological conditions and thus reflected the land use change effects to the greatest extent ji et al 2020 fig 1b c synthetic fertilizer haber bosch and urea about 132 kg n ha 1 yr 1 were mostly used in cultivated farmland wheat and maize whereas other non fertilized lands were respectively transformed from farmland in different years soil samples at 0 2 m depth increments were collected by a hollow stem auger each sample was partitioned into two subsamples for the determination of soil water and other physicochemical properties the soil water and nitrate contents were respectively measured by oven drying and ion chromatography ics 1100 the ratios of water standardized by z score to nitrate standardized by z score were used to evaluate the coupling effects of water and nitrate although combined with isotope compositions δ2h h2o δ18o h2o 3h h2o δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 the soil water and

controlling soil water variability while soil water content swc soil texture ms ph ec and soc were selected as possible controlling factors for nitrate variability soil properties were directly measured at each depth so the climate soil relationship at different depths could be established considering that soil water moved by piston flow the soil water at different depths corresponded to precipitation in different years the infiltration rate of 1963 precipitation was identified according to tritium peak 11 m and 22 m in sm and db data not shown with estimated infiltration rates from tritium peak method the ages of soil water at different depths were inversely calculated and the historical climatic factors along the soil profiles were reconstructed the monthly precipitation and temperature were collected from sm and db weather stations during 1957 2017 from china meteorological administration and the climate reconstruction results basically covered the 13 m deep boreholes the hargreaves formula recommended by fao was used to calculate et0 hargreaves et al 1994 partial correlation and bivariate wavelet coherence bwc n 2 were both used to explore the best individual

factors were estimated via the average value of wavelet coherence awc and percent area of significant coherence pasc of the total wavelet scale depth domain hu and si 2016 the pasc values were mostly considered to select the best combination of environmental factors just pasc values 5 were considered as statistically significant and an extra factor would not be considered significant unless pasc increased by at least 5 in addition we divided the entire domain into three scales when explaining variations i e small scales 2 5 m medium scales 2 5 7 5 m and large scales 7 5 m respectively 3 results 3 1 soil water and nitrate variability soil water contents varied with vegetation types and soil depths fig 2 a b the water contents under shallow rooted vegetation grassland and farmland were significantly higher than those of deep rooted vegetation apricot pine peashrub willow and poplar despite different vegetation types the water contents overall declined with increasing tree ages particularly the water contents within 10 15 m under older peashrub 35 years were higher than those of younger pine 25 years due to the shallow depth of root distribution with further results in less root water uptake the water contents within 0 2 m drastically fluctuated affected by the dual effects of precipitation and evapotranspiration the lower water contents below 2 m suggested large root water uptake effects under deep rooted shrubland and forestland apricot pine peashrub willow and poplar fig 2a b despite lower water contents under deep rooted vegetation the water contents in paleosol layers 8 12 m were relatively higher because of greater water retention capacity similarly nitrate contents also differed with vegetation types and soil depths fig 2c d the nitrate contents under deep rooted vegetation were relatively lower than those of farmland and grassland because of lower n fertilizer inputs the nitrate contents under deep rooted vegetation generally declined with tree ages with several exceptions due to differences in root absorption and n fixation for instance despite lower fertilizer inputs older peashrub had higher nitrate concentration than those of younger apricot and pine in sm due to the symbiotic n fixation of legumes and rhizobium the nitrate concentration showed a parabolic shape with the peak depths ranging 2 6 9 2 m fig 2c d the peak contents under grassland 98 2 mg l 1 and farmland 156 0 mg l 1 were significantly higher than those of deep rooted vegetation 31 8 76 1 mg l 1 with relatively larger peak depths 6 m for grassland and 6 2 m for farmland the older plants usually had greater stabilized depths and concentration therefore each profile was divided into two zones i e high variation zone high water deficit and nitrate accumulation within 0 10 m and relative stabilization zone low water deficit and nitrate accumulation below 10 m further the ratios of standardized water to standardized nitrate were 0 1 1 8 0 8 1 7 0 9 2 0 0 6 1 3 0 3 1 7 0 6 1 2 and 0 5 1 3 under different land use types fig 2e f obviously the positive and negative ratios suggested synergistic and antagonistic relationships of water and nitrate under shallow and deep rooted plants respectively this phenomenon indicated that nitrate could move easily with soil water under shallow rooted plants while nitrate was easily retained in the soil under deep rooted plants due to large water deficit in addition the standardized ratios in sm were highly variable across the entire profiles while the ratios in db largely fluctuated within 0 10 m and tended to stabilize below 10 m fig 2e f the results are consistent with soil water and nitrate profiles as described above drastically fluctuated within 0 10 m and relatively stabilized below 10 m and the ratios of standardized water to standardized nitrate can assess the coupling relationship between soil water and nitrate in soils as an important tool 3 2 variations of environmental factors the precipitation and et0 in sm insignificantly increased during 1957 2017 p 0 805 and 0 451 with the trends of 2 9 mm yr 1and 0 11 mm yr 1 respectively the temperature showed a significant upward trend p 0 001 fig s1 with the rate of 0 03 yr 1 the precipitation was stabilized p 0 361 while the temperature and et0 showed a significant upward trend in db p 0 001 with the increased rates of 3 7 mm yr 1 0 04 yr 1 and 0 76 mm yr 1 respectively fig s1 after climate reconstruction in the thick unsaturated zones the profiles within 0 12 6 m and 0 18 m in sm and db corresponded to the climatic factors during 1957 2017 and 1973 2017 respectively precipitation temperature and et0 mostly declined with soil depths but increased with time fig 3 the soil texture under different land use types fluctuated widely within the top 0 1 m and tended to stabilize within 1 5 m fig 4 a c but high variability was observed in the deep layers below 5 m with lower clay and higher sand contents in particular the silt and sand contents exhibited a complementary relationship i e higher silt contents corresponded to lower sand contents except for the surface layers the ms values were higher and more variable in the deep layers below 5 m fig 4d suggesting the difficulties of water and solute transport the ph values suggested that the soils under different land use types were alkaline which slightly increased with soil depths fig 4e with relatively higher ec values under shallow rooted plants the ec profiles were highly variable under different land use types fig 4f additionally the soc values in sm sharply decreased within the top 0 1 m and tended to stabilize below 1 m the soc values in db declined with soil depths with fluctuation in the deep layers under farmland and poplar fig 4g 3 3 individual factor explaining soil water and nitrate variations the soil water contents under different land use types were positively correlated with ms with the correlation coefficients ranging 0 29 0 82 p 0 01 table 2 in addition temperature significantly influenced soil moisture under apricot farmland and willow p 0 01 table 2 and the soil water contents under shallow rooted plants grassland and farmland were positively correlated with et0 p 0 05 table 2 according to wavelet analysis the best individual factor under each land use type was sand and or ms with the awc and pasc values ranging 0 45 0 60 and 17 44 table 3 the coherence mostly exhibited at large scales 7 5 m followed by medium scales 2 5 7 5 m sand exhibited out of phase coherence negative correlation with soil water while ms performed in phase coherence positive correlation with soil water at almost all depths fig 5 overall soil texture rather than climatic factors dominated soil water variability and ms was the most important factor the nitrate concentration under each land use type was simultaneously related to multiple soil physiochemical properties p 0 05 table 2 the best factors explaining nitrate variability under different land use types were ec swc soc ms and or ph with the correlation coefficients ranging from 0 69 to 0 56 table 2 according to wavelet analysis the best individual factor under each land use type was ec soc ms and or ph fig 5 with the awc and pasc values ranging 0 31 0 46 and 6 31 the coherence also exhibited at large scales 7 5 m followed by medium scales 2 5 7 5 m ms exhibited out of phase coherence negative correlation with nitrate while ec soc and ph exhibited in phase coherence positive correlation with nitrate at almost all depths table 3 overall swc ph ec and soc were the most important factors 3 4 multiple factors jointly controlling soil water and nitrate variations the soil water variability was mostly explained by sand ms t silt et0 table 4 which explained 39 87 under different land use types the best two factor combination was sand ms fig 6 the awc and pasc values ranged 0 67 0 78 and 17 45 and increased by 0 17 0 32 and 6 23 compared with the single factors table 3 the coherence was mostly observed at large scales 7 5 m and almost all depths further the best three factor combination was silt sand ms fig s2 the awc and pasc values ranged 0 81 0 87 and 21 48 and were improved by 0 09 0 14 and 4 6 compared with the two factor combination table 3 the environmental factors mostly contributed to soil water variability at medium 2 5 7 5 m and large scales 7 5 m the nitrate variability under each land use type was greatly explained by ec ph soc swc sand with the adjusted r2 ranging 0 31 0 82 table 4 further the best two factor combination was swc ec fig 6 with the awc and pasc values ranging 0 56 0 72 and 15 39 table 3 the awc and pasc values increased by 0 21 0 35 and 0 18 compared with the single factors mostly contributed by medium 2 5 7 5 m and large scales 7 5 m p 0 05 these factors explained nitrate variability at almost all depths the best three factor combination was swc ms ec fig s2 the awc and pasc values ranged 0 76 0 83 and 21 43 and increased by 0 09 0 20 and 0 17 compared with the two factor combination table 3 4 discussion 4 1 how do soil water and nitrate contents relate to land use the plantation of deep rooted plants greatly reduced soil water contents fig 2a b with the relative water deficit of 1249 mm and 646 mm in sm and db respectively the variations of soil water over time and depths were evaluated by tree ages i e space for time the water contents within 0 10 m gradually decreased from 1982 to 2017 in sm and from 1967 to 2017 in db with the exception of the middle 0 4 m in db fig 7 a c the phenomenon could be attributed to shallow depths of water consumption under willow compared to poplar the water deficit under deep rooted plants are closely correlated to large root water uptake effects shi et al 2021a tao et al 2021 the older the trees the higher the root biomass and transpiration effects li et al 2019b li et al 2016 li et al 2017 plant roots easily extend to deep soils usually 10 m in regions with seasonally arid climate and higher permeability li et al 2019a as such water deficit mostly occurs in deep soils which potentially reduces or even prevents groundwater recharge huang et al 2019 li et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 especially in those regions with thick vadose zones limited recharge rates and deep rooted plants gates et al 2011 li and si 2018 lin and wei 2006 despite lower rainfall in db 332 mm relative to sm 437 mm the higher recharge rates in db indicated by tritium peak depths were ascribed to the higher sand contents and lower matric suction table 5 which also confirmed the dominance of soil texture on water infiltration different degrees of residual nitrate were presented in the thick loess deposits after the transformation from grassland farmland to non fertilized forestlands and shrublands fig 2c d in this study higher tree ages usually indicated lower fertilizer inputs and higher root uptake under forestlands and shrublands therefore the lower nitrification of synthetic fertilizer applied before land use change and higher assimilation of vegetation ammonium and nitrate were converted into organic compounds i e amino acids and proteins both contributed to the lower nitrate contents under non fertilized lands ji et al 2020 similarly the nitrate contents within 0 10 m were assessed from 1982 to 2017 in sm and from 1967 to 2017 in db fig 7b d obviously the existence of residual nitrate suggested that the synthetic fertilizer may be retained for 50 years in the deep unsaturated zones ji et al 2020 that is to say n inputs organic amendments fixation and deposition were chronically greater than n outputs root absorption gaseous emissions and leaching scanlon et al 2008 yang et al 2020 nitrate leaching is still an important pathway for n loss on the loess plateau with the dominance of recharge rates on nitrate leakage huang et al 2018 ji et al 2021 the travel time of nitrate ranges between decades and centuries in those regions with low recharge rates and deep unsaturated zones kaandorp et al 2021 turkeltaub et al 2018 4 2 how do multiple environmental factors combine to control soil water and nitrate with the sampling depths ranging 13 8 18 m below the surface the deep soil water and nitrate reservoirs obviously varied with multiple environmental factors which were identified by both classical statistics partial correlation and smir table 2 4 and wavelet analysis bwc and mwc table 3 the results of wavelet analysis were overall consistent with those of classical statistics but could identify the combined effects of environmental factors at different depths and scales hu et al 2017 lu et al 2019 mihanović et al 2009 therefore it is essential to explore the multivariate controls of water and nitrate in deep loess deposits by multiple methods specifically the deep soil water reservoirs were individually or simultaneously influenced by sand and ms tables 2 4 first it is easier for soil water to infiltrate downwards in coarse textured soils with higher sand contents 35 7 44 5 due to the lower water retention capacity table 5 for instance the 1963 precipitation in sm and db has respectively moved approximately 11 m and 22 m in the past 54 years which is obviously deeper than reported for loess tablelands which had higher rainfall and fine textured soils huang et al 2020 huang et al 2019 li and si 2018 second as the important agent to characterize soil particle sizes ms was the key factor to explain the variations of sbd and deep soil water within 3 13 m lu et al 2019 theoretically the finer the particle sizes the larger the ms values shi et al 2021b in this study the paleosol layers with finer particle sizes and higher water contents had higher ms values fig 2 4 although particle size distribution is usually used to evaluate soil hydraulic properties yang et al 2020 ms may be more superior to characterize soil water variability in thick loess deposits due to its sensitivity to pedogenic factors and climate parameters jordanova and jordanova 2021 alternatively ms could substitute soil texture as the ideal indicator of soil water because of the convenience of measurement process and accuracy of measurement results in the future overall sand and ms were mostly responsible for the variability of deep soil water due to their interactions on water permeability and retention additionally the deep nitrate reservoirs were mostly controlled by swc ph ec and soc tables 2 4 first soil water controlled by soil particle sizes and ms significantly influences nitrate transport processes in soils the nitrate leaching rates are negatively correlated to clay and silt contents gao et al 2021 further soil water also affects aeration and redox potential which remarkably regulates nitrate transformation processes cui et al 2020 for instance higher soil water facilitates the occurrence of denitrification and ammonia volatilization sigler et al 2020 it is difficult for nitrate to transport and transformation in deep loess deposits with large water deficit fig 2 second the number of positive charges h on the soil surface decreases with increases ph values yang et al 2020 despite electrostatic attraction of h and no3 n nitrate was more leachable in the alkaline loess 8 5 9 0 table 5 especially for deep soils with higher ph values fig 4 third as an essential indicator of soil salinity the ec values are closely correlated to climate fertilization and soil texture in this study the saline alkali soil in northern shaanxi had high salinity table 5 which could destroy soil structure reduce soil aeration and further restrain the occurrence of n transformation processes finally the surface aggregated soc provided essential substrate and energy for n biogeochemical processes fig 4 with the carbon nitrogen coupling relationship in soils deng et al 2016 lu et al 2021 tashi et al 2016 in this study region we used nitrate contents and isotope compositions to explore the legacy effects and potential sources ji et al 2020 specifically nitrification and mineralization largely contribute to soil nitrate reservoirs on the loess plateau with the limited denitrification in deep loess deposits ji et al 2020 considering the predominant nitrification process ammonium in urea based fertilizer is quickly oxidized to no3 n under less udic moisture regime because of oxygen partial pressure variations and the nitrifying bacteria activities are also controlled by ph and soc elrys et al 2021b the mineralization of converting organic n to ammonium which provides an essential substrate for nitrification is positively affected by soil water and carbon contents but negatively influenced by ph elrys et al 2021a finer soil particles and favorable water contents promote the occurrence of mineralization and nitrification processes scanlon et al 2008 denitrification is the critical means to remove residual nitrate in soils the activity of heterotrophic denitrifying microorganisms is lower with limited soil water and organic carbon contents barkle et al 2007 ji et al 2020 nitrification mineralization and denitrification are suppressed in soils with high salinity the abundances of different functional genes amoa aoa amoa aob chia nifh nirs nirk and nosz are also affected by multiple environmental factors at different depths and scales kuypers et al 2018 levy booth et al 2014 lindsay et al 2010 xia et al 2011 which needs to be further explored by microbial approaches i e pcr quantification high throughput sequencing and metagenomics 4 3 what are the implications for vegetation and environmental management the conversion from grassland farmland to non fertilized forestlands and shrublands resulted in lower water storage recharge rates and nitrate leakage and this decrease was larger with stand ages of deep rooted plants huang et al 2019 huang et al 2021 particularly nitrate could still be observed in soils even after 50 years without fertilization therefore effective countermeasures should be taken for the sustainability of vegetation and environment first the deep rooted plants with high water deficit should be removed or converted to new vegetation with low root water uptake in an appropriate age ji et al 2021 alternatively adjusting vegetation density and mixed integrated cultivation are good options to conserve soil water second considering the potential risk of nitrate contamination to groundwater more attention should be paid to the removal of residual nitrate in deep unsaturated zones laboratory experiments have showed that the combined amendment of electric potential and biochar yuan et al 2020 addition of zero valent iron nanoparticles gibert et al 2021 and application of electro bioremediation choi et al 2009 greatly remove nitrate from the soil but their applicability on the loess plateau in terms of operability and economy needs to be carefully considered in the future furthermore the identified multivariate controls of deep soil water ms and sand and nitrate swc ph ec and soc are critical for developing scale and depth dependent simulation for downscaling and or upscaling with less labor and time this study benefits the parameterizing of hydrological and biogeochemical models especially in the deep unsaturated zones 5 conclusion understanding multivariate controls of soil water and nitrate in the deep unsaturated zones is essential to the sustainability of vegetation and environment thus this study explored this issue by analyzing the wavelet coherence of soil water nitrate with climatic factors and soil properties large water deficit and low nitrate accumulation were observed within 0 10 m under non fertilized forestlands and shrublands with negative ratios of standardized water to standardized nitrate specifically ms and sand were the most important influencing factors for soil water movement while swc ph ec and soc were individually or simultaneously responsible for nitrate transport and transformation especially at large scales 7 5 m this study promotes the accurate estimation of process based

2948,identifying the environmental factors controlling deep soil water and nitrate is important for the sustainability of vegetation and ecosystems however the combined effects of multiple factors at varying scales have been poorly understood especially in those regions with thick vadose zones and deep rooted plants the aim of this study is to identify the multivariate controls of water and nitrate in seven 13 m deep boreholes under different land use types on china s loess plateau after measuring soil water and nitrate contents the combined effects of climatic factors precipitation temperature and potential evapotranspiration and soil properties soil texture magnetic susceptibility ph ec and soil organic carbon were explored by wavelet analysis land use is the key factor regulating deep soil water and nitrate reservoirs with high water deficit and low nitrate accumulation within 0 10 m under non fertilized forestlands and shrublands the positive and negative standardized ratios respectively suggested the synergistic and antagonistic relationships of water and nitrate under shallow and deep rooted vegetation as the important agent for nitrate leaching soil water is influenced by magnetic susceptibility and sand furthermore soil water ph ec and soil organic carbon are individually or simultaneously responsible for nitrate transport and transformation

an important role in plant growth and groundwater recharge allison and hughes 1983 gee and hillel 2006 the plantation of deep rooted plants triggers soil water depletion because of canopy interception root uptake and evapotranspiration huang et al 2021 ji et al 2021 further the surplus nitrogen n fertilizer in soils which moves downward with soil water potentially threatens ecosystem and human health due to the lower nitrogen use efficiency nue of approximately 30 40 ju et al 2009 sebilo et al 2013 vitousek et al 1997 the accumulation effects under orchards and legacy effects under non fertilized forestlands have been largely reported gao et al 2021 ji et al 2020 turkeltaub et al 2018 the land use conversion from shallow to deep rooted vegetation significantly influences soil water and nitrate variability and further has significant impacts on groundwater recharge and water quality huang et al 2018 huang et al 2021 in addition to vegetation the variations of soil water and nitrate are closely controlled by climate topography soil type and their interactions dekker et al 2007 jackson et al 2004 as such it is essential to reveal the variations and controlling factors of water and nitrate for the sustainability of vegetation and ecosystems the predominant environmental factors of soil water and nitrate reservoirs vary with different scales and depths jiao et al 2021 padilla et al 2018 wang et al 2020 specifically soil texture greatly contributes to soil water infiltration at the field and catchment scales while climatic factors atmospheric circulation and geographical location dominate soil water movement at the regional and global scales gu et al 2021 li et al 2021 for instance it takes longer for soil water to move downwards in soils with higher clay and silt contents moreover nitrate inputs are largely controlled by anthropogenic activities such as fertilization regimes and tillage system fan et al 2010 gao et al 2019 soil water plays an indispensable role in transport processes of nutrient and or pollutant additionally soil n cycle is mostly driven by microorganisms whose survival and growth greatly depend on soil nutrient stoichiometry regulated by aboveground litters fine roots root exudates and sloughs li et al 2019a these effects of environmental factors have been intensively investigated in topsoil and or root zone niether et al 2017 yang et al 2020 zhao et al 2011 zheng et al 2020 but their multivariate controls at different scales and depths are still unknown especially in the regions with thick vadose zones and deep rooted plants han et al 2019 jackson et al 2004 yu et al 2019 traditional statistical analysis e g partial correlation linear regression and principal component analysis are mostly used to reveal the correlation between independent variables and different environmental factors at sampling scale lu et al 2019 zhu et al 2018 nevertheless the hydrological and biogeochemical processes in the deep unsaturated zones are complicated and scale dependent wiens 1989 and multiple variables may individually or simultaneously contribute to a certain process as an alternative several advanced methods e g empirical mode decomposition multiple spectral coherence and multiple wavelet coherence have been proposed si 2008 specifically wavelet analysis employs mathematical functions to explore the non stationary processes occurring in limited time and space at multiple scales hu et al 2017 mihanović et al 2009 the best factor and multi factor combination at specific scale and location are further untangled si and farrell 2004 considering the interactions of multiple environmental factors the dominant factors of soil water and nitrate variability should be carefully considered by multiple methods at different depths and scales hu et al 2017 lu et al 2019 china s loess plateau the largest loess covered area in the world 640 000 km2 100 million population is ecologically fragile with very serious water loss and soil erosion fu et al 2017 jia et al 2017b most cultivated farmlands have been converted into grasslands shrublands and forestlands since the 1950s li et al 2017 peng and li 2018 with vegetation cover improved by 28 by 2013 chen et al 2015 in the context of substantial land use conversion and deep vadose zones the loess plateau is an ideal platform for exploring deep water and nitrate reservoirs and their major environmental factors in specific high water deficit 1000 mm and nitrate nitrogen no3 n accumulation 7250 kg n ha 1 have been largely reported under deep rooted fruit trees huang et al 2021 jia et al 2018 liu et al 2019 precipitation and potential evapotranspiration et0 have greater contributions to soil water variability ye et al 2019 while ph and soil texture may dominate nitrate variability yang et al 2020 identifying the variations and multivariate controls of water and nitrate improve their predictability and further provide valuable information for hydrological and biogeochemical cycles in the thick loess deposits the objectives of this study are to identify the multivariate controls of water and nitrate in thick loess deposits under different land use types specifically we try to answer the following questions i how do soil water and nitrate contents relate to land use ii how do multiple environmental factors combine to control soil water and nitrate iii what are the implications for vegetation and environmental management this study provides essential information to the parameterizing of process based hydrological and biogeochemical models at regional or global scales especially in the thick unsaturated zones 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area shenmu sm and dingbian db counties were selected within the study region fig 1 a with a continental monsoon climate jia et al 2017a the long term 1957 2017 mean annual precipitation temperature and et0 in each location were shown in table 1 approximately 75 of the rainfall occurred in the rainy season june to september in the two areas the groundwater levels were 49 and 130 m below the ground sandy loam was the main soil texture with sand contents 45 zhu and shao 2008 soil bulk density sbd field capacity fc and wilting humidity wh were 1 26 g cm 3 13 and 3 respectively three layers of loess including wucheng loess q1 lower pleistocene 5 35 m lishi loess q2 middle pleistocene 40 220 m and malan loess q3 upper pleistocene 30 100 m covered the mudstone and sandstone bedrock with the paleosol layers distributed about 10 m below the surface the cultivated farmland mostly under wheat triticum aestivum and maize zea mays rotations has been converted to non fertilized grassland and shrub forestland since the 1980s including apricot prunus sp pine pinus sp peashrub caragana arborescens a n fixing food crop willow salix sp and poplar populus sp 2 2 sampling and analysis seven cores deeper than 13 m under different land use types were selected to be drilled in august 2017 table 1 they shared the similar climate soil and hydrological conditions and thus reflected the land use change effects to the greatest extent ji et al 2020 fig 1b c synthetic fertilizer haber bosch and urea about 132 kg n ha 1 yr 1 were mostly used in cultivated farmland wheat and maize whereas other non fertilized lands were respectively transformed from farmland in different years soil samples at 0 2 m depth increments were collected by a hollow stem auger each sample was partitioned into two subsamples for the determination of soil water and other physicochemical properties the soil water and nitrate contents were respectively measured by oven drying and ion chromatography ics 1100 the ratios of water standardized by z score to nitrate standardized by z score were used to evaluate the coupling effects of water and nitrate although combined with isotope compositions δ2h h2o δ18o h2o 3h h2o δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 the soil water and nitrate contents were used to explore recharge mechanism of soil water and legacy effects of nitrate in our previous studies ji et al 2020 ji et al 2021 but this study emphasized the multivariate controls of water and nitrate in the deep loess deposits under different land use types several physicochemical properties were also identified soil texture was determined by the sieve pipette method magnetic susceptibility ms was measured via the magnetic susceptibility meter ms2 bartington uk and dual frequency sensor ms2b dearing 1994 liu et al 2016 soil ph and ec were measured by the ph ion concentration conductivity multi parameter tester sg78 fk cn mettler toledo switzerland soil organic carbon soc was determined by dichromate oxidation method 2 3 combined effects of multiple environmental factors climatic factors and soil properties were both considered to discuss the possible combined effects because of their connections with soil water described below precipitation and et0 overall determine the inputs and outputs of soil water ye et al 2019 soil texture has significant impacts on water capacity and movement fang et al 2016 other soil properties and nutrient stoichiometry are responsible for n transformation processes lindsay et al 2010 yang et al 2020 as such precipitation temperature et0 soil texture and ms were considered as potential factors controlling soil water variability while soil water content swc soil texture ms ph ec and soc were selected as possible controlling factors for nitrate variability soil properties were directly measured at each depth so the climate soil relationship at different depths could be established considering that soil water moved by piston flow the soil water at different depths corresponded to precipitation in different years the infiltration rate of 1963 precipitation was identified according to tritium peak 11 m and 22 m in sm and db data not shown with estimated infiltration rates from tritium peak method the ages of soil water at different depths were inversely calculated and the historical climatic factors along the soil profiles were reconstructed the monthly precipitation and temperature were collected from sm and db weather stations during 1957 2017 from china meteorological administration and the climate reconstruction results basically covered the 13 m deep boreholes the hargreaves formula recommended by fao was used to calculate et0 hargreaves et al 1994 partial correlation and bivariate wavelet coherence bwc n 2 were both used to explore the best individual factor while stepwise multiple linear regression smir and multiple wavelet coherence mwc n 3 and 4 were both used to discuss the best multi factor combination explaining variations under different land use types the monte carlo method was used to obtain bwc and mwc at 95 significance level hu and si 2016 hu et al 2017 yang et al 2021 the presentation of individual and multiple environmental factors were estimated via the average value of wavelet coherence awc and percent area of significant coherence pasc of the total wavelet scale depth domain hu and si 2016 the pasc values were mostly considered to select the best combination of environmental factors just pasc values 5 were considered as statistically significant and an extra factor would not be considered significant unless pasc increased by at least 5 in addition we divided the entire domain into three scales when explaining variations i e small scales 2 5 m medium scales 2 5 7 5 m and large scales 7 5 m respectively 3 results 3 1 soil water and nitrate variability soil water contents varied with vegetation types and soil depths fig 2 a b the water contents under shallow rooted vegetation grassland and farmland were significantly higher than those of deep rooted vegetation apricot pine peashrub willow and poplar despite different vegetation types the water contents overall declined with increasing tree ages particularly the water contents within 10 15 m under older peashrub 35 years were higher than those of younger pine 25 years due to the shallow depth of root distribution with further results in less root water uptake the water contents within 0 2 m drastically fluctuated affected by the dual effects of precipitation and evapotranspiration the lower water contents below 2 m suggested large root water uptake effects under deep rooted shrubland and forestland apricot pine peashrub willow and poplar fig 2a b despite lower water contents under deep rooted vegetation the water contents in paleosol layers 8 12 m were relatively higher because of greater water retention capacity similarly nitrate contents also differed with vegetation types and soil depths fig 2c d the nitrate contents under deep rooted vegetation were relatively lower than those of farmland and grassland because of lower n fertilizer inputs the nitrate contents under deep rooted vegetation generally declined with tree ages with several exceptions due to differences in root absorption and n fixation for instance despite lower fertilizer inputs older peashrub had higher nitrate concentration than those of younger apricot and pine in sm due to the symbiotic n fixation of legumes and rhizobium the nitrate concentration showed a parabolic shape with the peak depths ranging 2 6 9 2 m fig 2c d the peak contents under grassland 98 2 mg l 1 and farmland 156 0 mg l 1 were significantly higher than those of deep rooted vegetation 31 8 76 1 mg l 1 with relatively larger peak depths 6 m for grassland and 6 2 m for farmland the older plants usually had greater stabilized depths and concentration therefore each profile was divided into two zones i e high variation zone high water deficit and nitrate accumulation within 0 10 m and relative stabilization zone low water deficit and nitrate accumulation below 10 m further the ratios of standardized water to standardized nitrate were 0 1 1 8 0 8 1 7 0 9 2 0 0 6 1 3 0 3 1 7 0 6 1 2 and 0 5 1 3 under different land use types fig 2e f obviously the positive and negative ratios suggested synergistic and antagonistic relationships of water and nitrate under shallow and deep rooted plants respectively this phenomenon indicated that nitrate could move easily with soil water under shallow rooted plants while nitrate was easily retained in the soil under deep rooted plants due to large water deficit in addition the standardized ratios in sm were highly variable across the entire profiles while the ratios in db largely fluctuated within 0 10 m and tended to stabilize below 10 m fig 2e f the results are consistent with soil water and nitrate profiles as described above drastically fluctuated within 0 10 m and relatively stabilized below 10 m and the ratios of standardized water to standardized nitrate can assess the coupling relationship between soil water and nitrate in soils as an important tool 3 2 variations of environmental factors the precipitation and et0 in sm insignificantly increased during 1957 2017 p 0 805 and 0 451 with the trends of 2 9 mm yr 1and 0 11 mm yr 1 respectively the temperature showed a significant upward trend p 0 001 fig s1 with the rate of 0 03 yr 1 the precipitation was stabilized p 0 361 while the temperature and et0 showed a significant upward trend in db p 0 001 with the increased rates of 3 7 mm yr 1 0 04 yr 1 and 0 76 mm yr 1 respectively fig s1 after climate reconstruction in the thick unsaturated zones the profiles within 0 12 6 m and 0 18 m in sm and db corresponded to the climatic factors during 1957 2017 and 1973 2017 respectively precipitation temperature and et0 mostly declined with soil depths but increased with time fig 3 the soil texture under different land use types fluctuated widely within the top 0 1 m and tended to stabilize within 1 5 m fig 4 a c but high variability was observed in the deep layers below 5 m with lower clay and higher sand contents in particular the silt and sand contents exhibited a complementary relationship i e higher silt contents corresponded to lower sand contents except for the surface layers the ms values were higher and more variable in the deep layers below 5 m fig 4d suggesting the difficulties of water and solute transport the ph values suggested that the soils under different land use types were alkaline which slightly increased with soil depths fig 4e with relatively higher ec values under shallow rooted plants the ec profiles were highly variable under different land use types fig 4f additionally the soc values in sm sharply decreased within the top 0 1 m and tended to stabilize below 1 m the soc values in db declined with soil depths with fluctuation in the deep layers under farmland and poplar fig 4g 3 3 individual factor explaining soil water and nitrate variations the soil water contents under different land use types were positively correlated with ms with the correlation coefficients ranging 0 29 0 82 p 0 01 table 2 in addition temperature significantly influenced soil moisture under apricot farmland and willow p 0 01 table 2 and the soil water contents under shallow rooted plants grassland and farmland were positively correlated with et0 p 0 05 table 2 according to wavelet analysis the best individual factor under each land use type was sand and or ms with the awc and pasc values ranging 0 45 0 60 and 17 44 table 3 the coherence mostly exhibited at large scales 7 5 m followed by medium scales 2 5 7 5 m sand exhibited out of phase coherence negative correlation with soil water while ms performed in phase coherence positive correlation with soil water at almost all depths fig 5 overall soil texture rather than climatic factors dominated soil water variability and ms was the most important factor the nitrate concentration under each land use type was simultaneously related to multiple soil physiochemical properties p 0 05 table 2 the best factors explaining nitrate variability under different land use types were ec swc soc ms and or ph with the correlation coefficients ranging from 0 69 to 0 56 table 2 according to wavelet analysis the best individual factor under each land use type was ec soc ms and or ph fig 5 with the awc and pasc values ranging 0 31 0 46 and 6 31 the coherence also exhibited at large scales 7 5 m followed by medium scales 2 5 7 5 m ms exhibited out of phase coherence negative correlation with nitrate while ec soc and ph exhibited in phase coherence positive correlation with nitrate at almost all depths table 3 overall swc ph ec and soc were the most important factors 3 4 multiple factors jointly controlling soil water and nitrate variations the soil water variability was mostly explained by sand ms t silt et0 table 4 which explained 39 87 under different land use types the best two factor combination was sand ms fig 6 the awc and pasc values ranged 0 67 0 78 and 17 45 and increased by 0 17 0 32 and 6 23 compared with the single factors table 3 the coherence was mostly observed at large scales 7 5 m and almost all depths further the best three factor combination was silt sand ms fig s2 the awc and pasc values ranged 0 81 0 87 and 21 48 and were improved by 0 09 0 14 and 4 6 compared with the two factor combination table 3 the environmental factors mostly contributed to soil water variability at medium 2 5 7 5 m and large scales 7 5 m the nitrate variability under each land use type was greatly explained by ec ph soc swc sand with the adjusted r2 ranging 0 31 0 82 table 4 further the best two factor combination was swc ec fig 6 with the awc and pasc values ranging 0 56 0 72 and 15 39 table 3 the awc and pasc values increased by 0 21 0 35 and 0 18 compared with the single factors mostly contributed by medium 2 5 7 5 m and large scales 7 5 m p 0 05 these factors explained nitrate variability at almost all depths the best three factor combination was swc ms ec fig s2 the awc and pasc values ranged 0 76 0 83 and 21 43 and increased by 0 09 0 20 and 0 17 compared with the two factor combination table 3 4 discussion 4 1 how do soil water and nitrate contents relate to land use the plantation of deep rooted plants greatly reduced soil water contents fig 2a b with the relative water deficit of 1249 mm and 646 mm in sm and db respectively the variations of soil water over time and depths were evaluated by tree ages i e space for time the water contents within 0 10 m gradually decreased from 1982 to 2017 in sm and from 1967 to 2017 in db with the exception of the middle 0 4 m in db fig 7 a c the phenomenon could be attributed to shallow depths of water consumption under willow compared to poplar the water deficit under deep rooted plants are closely correlated to large root water uptake effects shi et al 2021a tao et al 2021 the older the trees the higher the root biomass and transpiration effects li et al 2019b li et al 2016 li et al 2017 plant roots easily extend to deep soils usually 10 m in regions with seasonally arid climate and higher permeability li et al 2019a as such water deficit mostly occurs in deep soils which potentially reduces or even prevents groundwater recharge huang et al 2019 li et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 especially in those regions with thick vadose zones limited recharge rates and deep rooted plants gates et al 2011 li and si 2018 lin and wei 2006 despite lower rainfall in db 332 mm relative to sm 437 mm the higher recharge rates in db indicated by tritium peak depths were ascribed to the higher sand contents and lower matric suction table 5 which also confirmed the dominance of soil texture on water infiltration different degrees of residual nitrate were presented in the thick loess deposits after the transformation from grassland farmland to non fertilized forestlands and shrublands fig 2c d in this study higher tree ages usually indicated lower fertilizer inputs and higher root uptake under forestlands and shrublands therefore the lower nitrification of synthetic fertilizer applied before land use change and higher assimilation of vegetation ammonium and nitrate were converted into organic compounds i e amino acids and proteins both contributed to the lower nitrate contents under non fertilized lands ji et al 2020 similarly the nitrate contents within 0 10 m were assessed from 1982 to 2017 in sm and from 1967 to 2017 in db fig 7b d obviously the existence of residual nitrate suggested that the synthetic fertilizer may be retained for 50 years in the deep unsaturated zones ji et al 2020 that is to say n inputs organic amendments fixation and deposition were chronically greater than n outputs root absorption gaseous emissions and leaching scanlon et al 2008 yang et al 2020 nitrate leaching is still an important pathway for n loss on the loess plateau with the dominance of recharge rates on nitrate leakage huang et al 2018 ji et al 2021 the travel time of nitrate ranges between decades and centuries in those regions with low recharge rates and deep unsaturated zones kaandorp et al 2021 turkeltaub et al 2018 4 2 how do multiple environmental factors combine to control soil water and nitrate with the sampling depths ranging 13 8 18 m below the surface the deep soil water and nitrate reservoirs obviously varied with multiple environmental factors which were identified by both classical statistics partial correlation and smir table 2 4 and wavelet analysis bwc and mwc table 3 the results of wavelet analysis were overall consistent with those of classical statistics but could identify the combined effects of environmental factors at different depths and scales hu et al 2017 lu et al 2019 mihanović et al 2009 therefore it is essential to explore the multivariate controls of water and nitrate in deep loess deposits by multiple methods specifically the deep soil water reservoirs were individually or simultaneously influenced by sand and ms tables 2 4 first it is easier for soil water to infiltrate downwards in coarse textured soils with higher sand contents 35 7 44 5 due to the lower water retention capacity table 5 for instance the 1963 precipitation in sm and db has respectively moved approximately 11 m and 22 m in the past 54 years which is obviously deeper than reported for loess tablelands which had higher rainfall and fine textured soils huang et al 2020 huang et al 2019 li and si 2018 second as the important agent to characterize soil particle sizes ms was the key factor to explain the variations of sbd and deep soil water within 3 13 m lu et al 2019 theoretically the finer the particle sizes the larger the ms values shi et al 2021b in this study the paleosol layers with finer particle sizes and higher water contents had higher ms values fig 2 4 although particle size distribution is usually used to evaluate soil hydraulic properties yang et al 2020 ms may be more superior to characterize soil water variability in thick loess deposits due to its sensitivity to pedogenic factors and climate parameters jordanova and jordanova 2021 alternatively ms could substitute soil texture as the ideal indicator of soil water because of the convenience of measurement process and accuracy of measurement results in the future overall sand and ms were mostly responsible for the variability of deep soil water due to their interactions on water permeability and retention additionally the deep nitrate reservoirs were mostly controlled by swc ph ec and soc tables 2 4 first soil water controlled by soil particle sizes and ms significantly influences nitrate transport processes in soils the nitrate leaching rates are negatively correlated to clay and silt contents gao et al 2021 further soil water also affects aeration and redox potential which remarkably regulates nitrate transformation processes cui et al 2020 for instance higher soil water facilitates the occurrence of denitrification and ammonia volatilization sigler et al 2020 it is difficult for nitrate to transport and transformation in deep loess deposits with large water deficit fig 2 second the number of positive charges h on the soil surface decreases with increases ph values yang et al 2020 despite electrostatic attraction of h and no3 n nitrate was more leachable in the alkaline loess 8 5 9 0 table 5 especially for deep soils with higher ph values fig 4 third as an essential indicator of soil salinity the ec values are closely correlated to climate fertilization and soil texture in this study the saline alkali soil in northern shaanxi had high salinity table 5 which could destroy soil structure reduce soil aeration and further restrain the occurrence of n transformation processes finally the surface aggregated soc provided essential substrate and energy for n biogeochemical processes fig 4 with the carbon nitrogen coupling relationship in soils deng et al 2016 lu et al 2021 tashi et al 2016 in this study region we used nitrate contents and isotope compositions to explore the legacy effects and potential sources ji et al 2020 specifically nitrification and mineralization largely contribute to soil nitrate reservoirs on the loess plateau with the limited denitrification in deep loess deposits ji et al 2020 considering the predominant nitrification process ammonium in urea based fertilizer is quickly oxidized to no3 n under less udic moisture regime because of oxygen partial pressure variations and the nitrifying bacteria activities are also controlled by ph and soc elrys et al 2021b the mineralization of converting organic n to ammonium which provides an essential substrate for nitrification is positively affected by soil water and carbon contents but negatively influenced by ph elrys et al 2021a finer soil particles and favorable water contents promote the occurrence of mineralization and nitrification processes scanlon et al 2008 denitrification is the critical means to remove residual nitrate in soils the activity of heterotrophic denitrifying microorganisms is lower with limited soil water and organic carbon contents barkle et al 2007 ji et al 2020 nitrification mineralization and denitrification are suppressed in soils with high salinity the abundances of different functional genes amoa aoa amoa aob chia nifh nirs nirk and nosz are also affected by multiple environmental factors at different depths and scales kuypers et al 2018 levy booth et al 2014 lindsay et al 2010 xia et al 2011 which needs to be further explored by microbial approaches i e pcr quantification high throughput sequencing and metagenomics 4 3 what are the implications for vegetation and environmental management the conversion from grassland farmland to non fertilized forestlands and shrublands resulted in lower water storage recharge rates and nitrate leakage and this decrease was larger with stand ages of deep rooted plants huang et al 2019 huang et al 2021 particularly nitrate could still be observed in soils even after 50 years without fertilization therefore effective countermeasures should be taken for the sustainability of vegetation and environment first the deep rooted plants with high water deficit should be removed or converted to new vegetation with low root water uptake in an appropriate age ji et al 2021 alternatively adjusting vegetation density and mixed integrated cultivation are good options to conserve soil water second considering the potential risk of nitrate contamination to groundwater more attention should be paid to the removal of residual nitrate in deep unsaturated zones laboratory experiments have showed that the combined amendment of electric potential and biochar yuan et al 2020 addition of zero valent iron nanoparticles gibert et al 2021 and application of electro bioremediation choi et al 2009 greatly remove nitrate from the soil but their applicability on the loess plateau in terms of operability and economy needs to be carefully considered in the future furthermore the identified multivariate controls of deep soil water ms and sand and nitrate swc ph ec and soc are critical for developing scale and depth dependent simulation for downscaling and or upscaling with less labor and time this study benefits the parameterizing of hydrological and biogeochemical models especially in the deep unsaturated zones 5 conclusion understanding multivariate controls of soil water and nitrate in the deep unsaturated zones is essential to the sustainability of vegetation and environment thus this study explored this issue by analyzing the wavelet coherence of soil water nitrate with climatic factors and soil properties large water deficit and low nitrate accumulation were observed within 0 10 m under non fertilized forestlands and shrublands with negative ratios of standardized water to standardized nitrate specifically ms and sand were the most important influencing factors for soil water movement while swc ph ec and soc were individually or simultaneously responsible for nitrate transport and transformation especially at large scales 7 5 m this study promotes the accurate estimation of process based hydrological and biogeochemical models at regional or global scales especially in the deep unsaturated zones credit authorship contribution statement wangjia ji conceptualization writing original

2949,we build surrogate models for dynamic 3d subsurface single phase flow problems with multiple vertical producing wells the surrogate model provides efficient pressure estimation of the entire formation at any timestep given a stochastic permeability field arbitrary well locations and penetration lengths and a timestep matrix as inputs the well production rate or bottom hole pressure can then be determined based on peaceman s formula the original surrogate modeling task is transformed into an image to image regression problem using a convolutional encoder decoder neural network architecture the residual of the governing flow equation in its discretized form is incorporated into the loss function to impose theoretical guidance on the model training process as a result the accuracy and generalization ability of the trained surrogate models are significantly improved compared to those of fully data driven models they are also shown to possess flexible extrapolation ability to permeability fields with different statistics the surrogate models are used to conduct uncertainty quantification considering a stochastic permeability field as well as to infer unknown permeability information based on limited well production data and observation data of formation properties results are shown to be in close accordance with those of traditional numerical simulation tools but computational efficiency is dramatically improved keywords theory guided machine learning convolutional neural network surrogate modeling subsurface flow uncertainty quantification inverse problem data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the prediction of fluid transport in subsurface formations constitutes a non trivial task song et al 2016 xu et al 2020 yin et al 2020 partly due to incomplete knowledge of formation physical properties such as porosity and permeability therefore uncertainty quantification is usually desired prior to making production decisions zhang et al 2000 moreover it is often necessary to infer unknown parameter fields based on available production observation data i e inverse modeling problems or history matching chang et al 2010 and to predict future production the solution of both problems relies on accurate forward models that predict the dynamic pressure saturation distribution based on given initial ic and boundary conditions bc traditionally such forward models are constructed by numerical approaches such as finite difference finite volume or finite element methods aziz and settari 1979 these methods have successfully evolved over the past centuries and serve as reliable solvers for varieties of subsurface flow problems however they are not computationally efficient especially when solving large scale 3d problems on millions of grids nor are they flexible in handling problems with complex physics surrogate models on the other hand are desirable alternatives since they improve the efficiency of forward prediction at a minimal cost of accuracy by learning the correlation between inputs and outputs based on available data recently deep neural networks dnns have been widely utilized to build surrogate models due to their strong capability to learn complex correlations between inputs and outputs goodfellow et al 2016 kadeethum et al 2021 wen et al 2021a wen et al 2021b purely data driven dnns however possess limited generalization ability or they may make non physical predictions especially when the training data are of limited amount or of poor quality lecun et al 2015 theory guided machine learning emerged under such conditions karpatne et al 2017 raissi et al 2019 by incorporating physical laws ic bc constraints engineering controls or expert knowledge into the training process of dnns the robustness and generalization ability of the trained models are dramatically improved varieties of theory guided machine learning frameworks models have been proposed such as the theory guided data science tgds framework karpatne et al 2017 the physics informed neural network pinn raissi et al 2019 and the theory guided neural network tgnn wang et al 2020 or its weak form variant tgnn wf xu et al 2021a 2021b indeed they have achieved promising results in the solution of partial differential equations pdes raissi et al 2019 raissi and karniadakis 2018 inverse problems jo et al 2019 wang et al 2020 uncertainty quantification tripathy and bilionis 2018 wang et al 2021a and optimization tasks wang et al 2022 xu et al 2021a most of the works mentioned above constructed surrogate models based on fully connected neural networks fcnns it has been shown however that fcnns have limited performance when building high dimensional surrogate models mo et al 2019a zhu and zabaras 2018 furthermore the large parameter space as a result of deep network structures required to deal with complex problems increases the computational burden on the other hand convolutional neural networks cnns constitute promising alternatives image to image regression is more efficient to deal with high dimensional problems in addition the parameter sharing scheme of convolutional kernels dramatically reduces the size of the parameter space recently the data driven convolutional encoder decoder architecture has been frequently used to build surrogate models for subsurface flow and contaminant transport problems jin et al 2020 mo et al 2020 2019b zhu and zabaras 2018 however few attempts have been made to incorporate theoretical guidance into the training process of cnns zhu et al 2019 proposed a physics constrained encoder decoder network that utilized the sobel filter gao et al 2010 to approximate the spatial gradients but the temporal gradients could not be obtained therefore only steady state problems were studied in their work wang et al 2021b developed a theory guided autoencoder tgae framework that utilizes the discrete finite difference scheme to impose theoretical guidance which can approximate both spatial and temporal gradients but only 2d problems were probed without consideration of sources sinks subsequently they proposed a theory guided cnn tgcnn framework based on tgae and studied 2d problems with consideration of producing wells wang et al 2022 2021c in this work we modify the tgcnn framework to solve 3d problems the major novelty and contribution of this work is the proposition of a way to incorporate governing physics based on the finite difference method for 3d subsurface hydrology problems into the surrogate model training process especially the way to handle producing wells penetrating the formation at arbitrary lengths and to properly incorporate complex bcs and ics thus reducing the data dependence of conventional data driven neural networks while improving accuracy the major difference of this work compared to the theory guided machine learning works reported on 2d problems e g wang et al 2021c is fourfold 1 for 3d problems gravity is considered in our case which complicates the governing equation necessitating the definition of a potential function instead of pressure as in 2d problems 2 we consider a more complicated case for the production well which can penetrate the formation at arbitrary lengths in the vertical direction while for 2d problems the well is only considered as a point sink for 3d problems the flow rate or bottom hole pressure along each perforated grid of a production well are functions of formation properties such as permeability which is also more complicated than 2d cases 3 the treatment of reservoir boundary grids is more delicate for 3d problems which not only have line boundaries but also face boundary and point boundary grids each of which requires different treatment of the governing equations and 4 for initial conditions in our cases the formation is equilibrated with gravity rather than a uniform initial condition as for 2d problems reported by wang et al 2021c in this study we use the modified tgcnn to build surrogate models for dynamic subsurface flow problems with local sinks producing wells using limited training data uncertainty quantification and inverse modeling tasks are investigated using the constructed surrogate models which will be shown to have superior efficiency at a minimal cost of accuracy compared to conventional numerical simulation tools the remainder of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 we describe the forward and inverse problems formulation regarding 3d single phase flow with multiple producing wells which are commonly encountered in the early development stage of an oil formation in section 3 we briefly introduce the architecture of the convolutional encoder decoder network for surrogate modeling and the method to incorporate theoretical guidance via discretizing the governing equations we also demonstrate the inverse modeling technique particle swarm optimization used in this study in section 4 we demonstrate the construction of surrogate models based on tgcnn and show their accuracy and extrapolation ability compared to data driven cnns in sections 5 and 6 we design several case studies using the surrogate models to solve uncertainty quantification and inverse modeling problems and demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of tgcnn compared to numerical simulation tools in section 7 we discuss limitations of the proposed method suggest directions for future work and conclude the study 2 problem description 2 1 governing equations we consider a petroleum formation saturated with oil at the early development stage drilled with multiple producing wells the single phase oil transport equation considering the gravity effect can be written as follows 1 ρ k μ p ρ g q ρ ϕ t where ρ is the oil density k is the permeability μ is the oil viscosity p is the oil pressure g is the gravity factor ϕ is the porosity and q is the mass flow rate of oil at the producing wells by introducing the formation factor b o the oil compressibility factor c o and defining the oil potential φ p ρ g z eq 1 can be rewritten in 3d 2 x k x μ b o φ x y k y μ b o φ y z k z μ b o φ z q sc ϕ c o b o φ t where q sc is the oil producing volumetric flow rate at standard conditions 2 2 uncertainty quantification when the parameters in eq 2 are random fields a stochastic pde is formulated and the solution is no longer deterministic uncertainty quantification tasks arise so that the statistics of the solution e g mean and variance can be estimated herein we treat the permeability field k as a random field obeying a certain probability distribution function p k ω let η x t k x denote the solution of the stochastic pde the mean and variance of η can then be obtained as follows 3 1 μ x t ω η x t k x p k d k 3 2 σ 2 x t ω η x t k x μ x t 2 p k d k 2 3 inverse modeling the prediction of dynamic pressure distribution given a realization of the permeability field at fixed ic bc and well controls wcs e g producing at a certain flow rate or bottom hole pressure bhp formulates the following forward problem 4 f k i c b c w c p x t the corresponding inverse problem is defined as 5 k f 1 p i c b c w c i e to resolve the unknown permeability field based on observation data of pressure ic bc and wcs in practice however measurement of the pressure distribution of the entire formation is not feasible and usually the observation data are limited to the vicinity of wells such as well producing rates bhps and local permeability data obtained by well logging or core analysis techniques the inverse modeling task based on these limited data is therefore more challenging and the solution might not be unique 3 methodology 3 1 convolutional encoder decoder network for surrogate modeling we use a convolutional encoder decoder network to approximate the complex correlation between the inputs and outputs of the forward model eq 4 i e building surrogate models without solving the equation the original surrogate modeling task in the continuous spatial and temporal domains is transformed into an image to image regression problem by discretizing the problem on a mesh grid similar to that used in numerical approaches such as the finite difference method for the 3d problem in which we are interested the regression function can be written as 6 η ℝ n x h l w ℝ n y h l w where h l and w represent the number of grid points along the height length and width dimension respectively and n x and n y represent the number of input and output channels respectively here we have two input channels n x 2 including the discretized permeability field k r h l w and the time matrix of the same size t r h l w with each element being the same timestep t i at which the pressure is to be predicted the output channel n y 1 is the pressure field p r h l w at timestep t i the encoder decoder network has been widely employed for image reconstruction and regression modeling tasks for image type inputs and outputs goodfellow et al 2016 here we use the autoencoder architecture wang et al 2021b shown in fig 1 which is a special type of encoder decoder network the encoder component extracts high level coarse features from input images by performing a sequence of convolutional operations the fully connected layer transforms the output from the encoder component to a latent vector i e the codes the decoder component then reconstructs the output based on the codes by performing deconvolutional operations the weights and biases of the convolutional filters and the fully connected layers are the major parameters denoted as θ that need to be optimized during the training process so that the following loss function is minimized 7 loss data θ i 1 n k j 1 n t η k i t i η k i t i θ 2 2 where η and η are reference values and network predictions respectively and n k and n t are the total number of permeability field realizations and the number of timesteps used to calculate the pressure distributions respectively which constitutes the training dataset the optimization task min loss data θ can be conducted by different algorithms such as stochastic gradient descent sgd or adaptive moment estimation adam lecun et al 2015 3 2 theory guided training the training process described in section 3 1 is fully data driven and therefore depends highly on the amount and quality of the training data to achieve reasonable interpolation abilities however when there are limited or low quality training data the performance of data driven models is not guaranteed here we introduce the concept of theory guided training in which known governing equations pdes can be used to guide the training process raissi et al 2019 wang et al 2020 xu et al 2021b specifically the pde residual approximated by the neural network can be added to the loss function and minimized during the training so that the model prediction not only follows the patterns learned from the training data but also obeys physical laws imposed by pdes as a result the data dependence of the neural network training process is alleviated which is especially beneficial in this case since 3d large scale numerical simulations are time consuming the discretized eq 2 in the fully implicit scheme on the cartesian grids of the input images can be written as 8 k x μ b o i 1 2 j k φ i 1 j k n 1 φ i j k n 1 δ x 2 k x μ b o i 1 2 j k φ i j k n 1 φ i 1 j k n 1 δ x 2 k y μ b o i j 1 2 k φ i j 1 k n 1 φ i j k n 1 δ y 2 k y μ b o i j 1 2 k φ i j k n 1 φ i j 1 k n 1 δ y 2 k z μ b o i j k 1 2 φ i j k 1 n 1 φ i j k n 1 δ

coordinate δ x δ y a n d δ z are the grid intervals in x y a n d z directions respectively and δ t is the time interval the inter grid permeability is calculated as the harmonic mean of the two neighboring grids for vertical wells producing at a constant flow rate the individual flow rate at each perforated grid is allocated based on its permeability q i q sc k i i 1 n p k i where k i is the permeability of the ith perforated grid and n p is the total number of perforated grids of that well along the vertical direction for wells producing at a constant bhp the flow rate of the ith perforated grid is calculated based on peaceman s formula aziz and settari 1979 9 q i 2 π δ z k x k y μ ln r 0 r w p well i b h p where p well i is the pressure of the ith perforated grid r w is the wellbore radii and r 0 is the radii of the effect drainage area which is defined as follows 10 r 0 0 28 k y δ x 2 k x δ y 2 k x k y the flow rate of the well is then the summation of all perforated grids the pde residual r loss can be calculated from the neural network approximation of eq 8 11 1 loss pde θ m 1 n k v n 1 n t v r k m t n θ 2 2 11 2 r k m t n θ 1 n g i j k n g k x μ b o i 1 2 j k η

θ i j k η k m t n δ t θ i j k δ t where n k v and n t v are the number of realizations of stochastic permeability fields and the number of timesteps respectively used to enforce pde constraints and n g is the total number of spatial grids inside of the computational domain for the no flow boundary conditions considered here the loss function for the bc loss bc θ takes the same form as eq 11 except that it is only evaluated on the boundary grids and the potential values of the grids outside of the domain are treated the same as their nearest neighbors on the boundaries so that no flow across the boundaries might occur it is worth noting that this set of realizations n k v shares the same statistical properties as the training ones n k but is generated with a different random seed they are not intended for pressure calculation to provide labelled training data but are only used to calculate the pde and bc residuals to enforce the physical constraints we will later refer to such set of permeability fields as virtual permeability fields commonly we generate more virtual permeability fields than the training ones due to two reasons 1 the acquisition of labelled training data using uncong is time consuming while the generation of virtual permeability fields is trivial and 2 the labelled training data are only intended to provide certain guidance in the model training process so that the model can learn better based on theoretical guidance on the virtual permeability fields in other words the model training process is in essence a pde solution learning process applied on the virtual permeability fields as long as there are enough representative virtual permeability fields used in the model training process the generalizability of the trained model to unseen permeability fields with similar statistics can be enhanced the initial condition is imposed in a hard manner via transforming the original network output η 0 in the following way to obtain the updated output η 12 η φ 0 1 t t η 0 so that at initial state t 0 the network output is guaranteed to be the specified initial potential φ 0 the total loss is then defined as the summation of data mismatch and pde residual which is calculated based on the updated output η eq 12 from the decoder 13 loss λ 1 l o s s data θ λ 2 l o s s pde θ λ 3 l o s s bc θ where λ 1 λ 2 and λ 3 are the weights lagrange multipliers of the corresponding losses to softly enforce the physical constraints 3 3 stochastic permeability fields generation a series of stochastic permeability fields need to be generated to enforce theoretical guidance in the training process so that a reliable surrogate model can be built that extrapolates to other permeability fields with similar statistics here we consider gaussian type permeability fields and use karhunen loeve expansion kle chang and zhang 2015 zhang and lu 2004 to parameterize the random field for a gaussian random field z x τ ln k x τ where x is the spatial domain and τ is the probability space it can be expressed as z x τ z x z x τ where z x is the average value of the random field and z x τ is the fluctuation the spatial structure of the random field can be described by the two point covariance function c z x x z x τ z x τ using kle the random field can be decomposed as ghanem and spanos 2003 14 z x τ z x i 1 λ i f i x ξ i τ where λ i and f i are the ith eigenvalue and eigenfunction of the covariance respectively and ξ i is a gaussian random variable with zero mean and unit variance for separable exponential covariance function c z x x σ z 2 exp x 1 x 2 η x y 1 y 2 η y z 1 z 2 η z where σ z 2 and η are the variance and correlation length of the random field respectively the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions can be solved analytically or semi analytically the details of which can be found in zhang and lu 2004 practically we truncate eq 15 by the first several terms and therefore a random field can be generated using a collection of ξ 3 4 particle swarm optimization for inverse problems particle swarm optimization pso is a stochastic population based optimization method proposed by kennedy and eberhart 1995 it simulates animals social behavior such as birds and fish of food hunting in a cooperative way specifically it solves an optimization problem by having a population of candidate particles moving around in the search space to find the minimum fitness value or the function to be minimized each particle s movement is influenced by its local best position as well as the best positions of the entire population so that the swarm is expected to move towards the best solutions the major advantage of pso compared to other gradient based approaches such as gradient descent or newton methods is that pso does not require the problem to be differentiable bonyadi and michalewicz 2017 the position and velocity of the particles in pso are iteratively updated based on the following formula 15 1 v i n 1 ω v i n c 1 r 1 n p b e s t i n x i n c 2 r 2 n g b e s t n x i n 15 2 x i n 1 x i n v i n 1 where v i n and x i n are the velocity and location of the ith particle at the nth iteration respectively pbes t i n is the local best known location of the ith particle gbes t n is the global best location of the entire species at the nth iteration c 1 and c 2 are the learning rates r 1 n and r 2 n are two sets of random numbers and ω is the inertia weight which is used to control the influence of the previous velocity value on the updated velocity shi and eberhart 1998 4 surrogate models construction using tgcnn we consider a 3d formation saturated with oil the geometrical and petrophysical properties of the formation and the oil within are shown in table 1 we assume that the stochastic permeability field k obeys a lognormal distribution with ln k 4 md σ ln k 2 0 5 and the correlation length is set to be η x η y η z 152 4 m we truncate eq 15 with the first 13 terms which reserves 60 of the energy the random field can then be reconstructed using 13 independent random variables ξ i i 1 2 13 the 3d formation is discretized into 60 220 and 10 grids in x y and z directions respectively four producing wells are placed near the four corners of the formation and the wells penetrate and perforate the entire formation in the vertical direction fig 2 shows three example realizations of permeability fields and the corresponding well locations the initial pressure of the formation is gravitationally stabilized and the reference pressure at the top of the formation is 413 69 bar the boundaries of the formation are treated as no flow bcs two types of well control operations are considered including constant flow rate 50 m3 d std case 1 and constant bhp 350 bar case 2 both conditions are commonly used in field operations and they require different treatments in the formulation of theoretical guidance we consider the calculation of the pressure distribution of the formation in 20 timesteps with each timestep representing either 3 days for case 1 or 1 day for case 2 the reference solution of the problem is obtained using uncong software li et al 2015 while many other numerical simulation tools can also be used the detailed convolutional encoder decoder network architecture designed for the surrogate modeling task is shown in fig 3 the input images consist of two channels including the permeability field and time matrix in the encoder component 3d convolutional filters with different sizes and strides are applied followed by the swish activation function to reduce the input dimension and extract local features a fc layer follows the encoder component with a single hidden layer and no activation function to encode the information into the latent variables the hidden layer latent space has a dimension of 100 neurons the decoder component performs a series of deconvolutional operations followed by the elu activation function to produce the output pressure images 4 1 surrogate modeling for case 1 constant flow rate in this case we consider the four wells all producing at a constant flow rate of 50 m3 d std the training parameters for case 1 are listed in table 2 for comparison we also trained a data driven cnn using similar settings the training time using the cnn for case 1 takes approximately 22 min on 4 nvidia v100 gpus it should be noted that the time required to prepare the training data depends on the size of the dataset in our cases for example obtaining the pressure data for 50 stochastic permeability fields using uncong it takes approximately 20 min for either case 1 or 2 on an intel r xeon r gold 6240 cpu the trained surrogate model is then tested on 50 stochastic permeability fields generated using a different random seed from the training set the accuracy of the surrogate model prediction compared to reference values is evaluated using two criteria i e the relative l 2 error and the coefficient of determination r 2 score which are defined as follows 16 l 2 η nn η 2 η 2 17 r 2 1 i 1 n r η i nn η i 2 i 1 n r η i η 2 where 2 represents the standard euclidean norm n r is the total number of evaluation points for r 2 and η is the average value of η and η can be either the pressure or well flow rate bhp the accuracy of the surrogate model is evaluated on each of the permeability fields in the training and testing sets the results of which are shown in the boxplots in fig 4 for comparison we also show the results using the fully data driven cnn with the same network architecture and training parameters as shown in fig 4 both tgcnn and cnn have comparable accuracy and good extrapolation ability when evaluated on the entire pressure fields cnn predictions of well bhp however are not accurate even on the training set and the results are much worse than tgcnn on the testing set in terms of the mean and variance of the relative l 2 error or r 2 score the prediction of bhp or well flow rate depends highly on the prediction accuracy of the pressure of the grids penetrated by the well without theoretical guidance cnn minimizes the mean prediction error of the entire grids of the input images while the local grids containing the well might have larger errors than the other ones the errors propagate to the calculation of bhp or well flow rate based on peaceman s formula leading to poor prediction accuracy of cnn on the other hand when theoretical guidance is enforced additional physical constraints are implemented on the grids containing the well leading to more accurate prediction of their pressures therefore incorporating theoretical guidance into the training process assists to capture local fluctuations pressure disturbance caused by sources sinks more effectively as an example fig 5 shows the reference and tgcnn predicted pressure distribution at three timesteps for a permeability field drawn from the testing set top left field in fig 2 tgcnn predictions are close to the reference values with negligible absolute error the largest error occurs at the corners of the formation one possible explanation for such behavior is the difficulty in the proper implementation of no flow boundary conditions even for numerical approaches furthermore the residuals of the governing equation on the boundary and internal grids are calculated separately which does not guarantee equal performance fig 6 shows the well bhp variation along the production timeline estimated by tgcnn and cnn based surrogate models good agreement with the reference values is observed for tgcnn while cnn results are constantly divergent by a certain degree 4 2 surrogate modeling for case 2 constant bhp in this case we consider the four wells all producing at a constant bhp of 350 bar the training parameters for case 2 are listed in table 3 for comparison we also trained a data driven cnn using similar settings the training time using the cnn for case 2 takes approximately 38 min on 4 nvidia v100 gpus the trained surrogate model is tested on 50 stochastic permeability fields generated using a different random seed from the training set the accuracy of the surrogate model is evaluated on each of the permeability fields in the training and testing sets the results of which are presented in the boxplots in fig 7 for comparison results using the fully data driven cnn are shown as well different from case 1 although both cnn and tgcnn have high accuracy on the training set for the entire pressure fields the extrapolation ability of cnn to the testing set is poor with larger variance in accuracy on the other hand tgcnn has high accuracy on both the training and test sets with r 2 score close to 1 for well flow rate prediction the advantage of using tgcnn is more obvious cnn has low accuracy on both the training and testing set with a mean r 2 score of approximately 0 6 and several extreme cases with r 2 score close to 0 while tgcnn significantly outperforms cnn with r 2 score close to 1 this indicates that data driven cnn surrogate models only ensure global accuracy at the cost of local accuracy and possess limited extrapolation ability to inputs not seen previously incorporating theoretical guidance improves the models generalization ability and assists the models to better capture local fluctuations discontinuities as an example fig 8 shows the reference and tgcnn predicted pressure distribution at three timesteps for a permeability field drawn from the testing set top left field in fig 2 tgcnn predictions are close to the reference values with negligible absolute error similar to case 1 the largest error occurs at the corners of the formation fig 9 shows the well flow rate variation along the production timeline tgcnn shows good agreement with the reference values while cnn consistently overestimates the well flow rates 4 3 generalization ability of the surrogate models here we test the generalization ability of the trained surrogate model to permeability fields with different statistics for the sake of brevity we only consider producing wells with constant bhp we first keep the mean and correlation length of the stochastic permeability field to be constant as used in section 4 2 ln k 4 md η 152 4 m and vary the variance of the permeability five cases are considered with σ ln k 2 0 1 0 3 0 5 0 7 and 0 9 for each case 50 stochastic permeability fields are generated and the pressure distribution over 20 timesteps is predicted using the same tgcnn surrogate model in section 4 2 which was trained based on the case with σ ln k 2 0 5 the prediction accuracy of the pressure and well flow rates is quantified as shown in fig 10 in comparison to uncong simulation results it can be seen that the generalization ability of the surrogate model to permeability fields with smaller variances σ ln k 2 0 5 is much better than larger ones σ ln k 2 0 5 which is as expected since permeability fields with larger variances introduce stronger heterogeneity and the surrogate model may struggle to handle out of distribution inputs permeability values in general the accuracy of the surrogate model increases with the decrease in σ ln k 2 and the surrogate model can be trusted to provide reliable predictions for permeability fields with σ ln k 2 0 7 with r 2 0 98 we then keep the mean and variance of the stochastic permeability field to be constant ln k 4 md σ ln k 2 0 5 and vary the correlation length five cases are considered with η 100 130 152 170 and 200 m for each case 50 stochastic permeability fields are generated and the pressure distribution over 20 timesteps is predicted using the same tgcnn surrogate model trained based on the case with η 152 m the prediction accuracy of the pressure and well flow rates is quantified as shown in fig 11 in comparison to uncong simulation results the generalization ability of the surrogate model to permeability fields with larger correlation length η 152 m is much better than smaller ones η 152 m which is as expected since permeability fields with smaller correlation length introduce more complicated local patterns that are not learned by the convolutional filters in general the accuracy of the surrogate model increases with correlation length and the surrogate model can be trusted to provide reliable predictions for permeability fields with η 130 m with r 2 0 93 4 4 surrogate modeling for more heterogeneous permeability fields to further improve the generalization ability of the surrogate model to more heterogeneous permeability fields we demonstrate another example of training the neural network on stochastic permeability fields with a larger variance 1 0 and smaller correlation length 50 which is approximately 7 14 of the domain the training parameters are listed in table 4 the trained surrogate model is tested on 50 stochastic permeability fields generated using a different random seed from the training set the overall r 2 for the pressure and well production rates estimation are 0 982 and 0 991 respectively indicating good extrapolation ability of the surrogate model in contrast the surrogate model trained only based on the labelled training dataset results in much lower accuracy the overall r 2 for pressure and well production rates estimation are 0 765 and 0 553 respectively as an example we demonstrate in fig 12 the comparison of pressure and well production rates estimation between the surrogate model and uncong simulation for three testing permeability fields for all three cases tgcnn predicted pressure and well production rates align closely with the reference values we then conduct a similar extrapolation ability test to that in section 4 3 using the newly trained surrogate model a wider range of parameter ranges are tested and the results are shown in table 5 and table 6 we only show well production rates estimation results here for the sake of brevity and similar trends are observed for the overall pressure estimation since the current model is trained using more heterogeneous permeability fields it demonstrates more flexible generalization ability to a wider range of stochastic permeability fields with different variances or correlation lengths in this case satisfying results can be obtained for variance up to 2 0 and correlation length down to 20 0 approximately 3 to 6 of the domain 4 5 surrogate modeling for varying well locations and penetration lengths here we consider a more complex situation in which it is desired to estimate the pressure profile and well production rates assuming constant bhp given not only a stochastic permeability field but also arbitrary well locations and well penetration lengths the total number of wells remains the same in this way a more general surrogate model can be constructed to provide efficient uncertainty quantification and inverse modeling tasks for different well patterns without the need to retrain the model moreover such a model is also useful for optimization of the well location or pumping rates to achieve the highest cumulative production in this case an additional input channel is needed which provides well locations and penetration lengths information here we construct a 3d well image which is a binary image of the same size as the permeability image the image grids containing the wells of arbitrary location and penetration length take the value of one while the other grids take the value of zero the network structure is the same as that in previous cases with only an additional input channel the training parameters are listed in table 7 the trained surrogate model is tested on 50 stochastic permeability fields with random well locations and penetration lengths generated using a different random seed from the training set the overall r 2 for the pressure and well production rates are 0 994 and 0 996 respectively indicating good extrapolation ability of the surrogate model as an example we demonstrate in fig 13 the comparison of pressure and well production rates estimation between the surrogate model and uncong simulation for three different testing cases with detailed well location and penetration length information presented in table 8 for all three cases tgcnn predicted pressure and well production rates align closely with the reference values indicating good generalizability of the surrogate model not only to permeability fields with similar statistics but also to arbitrary combinations of well locations and penetration lengths 5 uncertainty quantification using the constructed surrogate model introduced in section 4 we perform uncertainty quantification of the pressure of the entire field producing well bhps for case 1 and well flow rates for case 2 we assume that the statistics of the permeability field are known beforehand with ln k 4 md σ ln k 2 0 5 and the correlation length is η x η y η z 152 4 m the well locations and penetration lengths are the same as those in section 4 1 the statistical results are analyzed using 20 000 randomly generated permeability fields sampled by the monte carlo method which we refer to as tgcnn mc the same procedures are also performed using uncong software the results of which are taken as the reference values which we refer to as uncong mc for comparison we also calculated the statistics using uncong mc with the same number of forward numerical model runs as used in the tgcnn based surrogate modeling training process 5 and 30 realizations for cases 1 and 2 respectively see table 2 for case 1 the prediction of pressure distribution of 20 000 permeability fields in 20 timesteps takes approximately 90 min for tgcnn mc while it takes about 120 h 5 d for uncong mc to finish the same calculation note that the prediction processes herein and thereafter for tgcnn mc and uncong mc are both conducted on an intel r xeon r gold 6240 cpu the efficiency of the surrogate model even with consideration of training time 38 min is 50 times faster than traditional numerical simulation tools such as uncong uncertainty quantification results mean and variance of pressure in the entire field at three timesteps are shown in fig 14 and fig 15 good agreement with the reference uncong mc results using 20 000 realizations is observed for tgcnn mc however uncong mc using five realizations demonstrates noticeably large deviation from the reference and much larger error is observed around the wells fig 16 shows the well bhp uncertainty analysis of the four producing wells at each timestep the mean and variance of the estimated bhp by tgcnn mc and uncong mc using 20 000 realizations are in close accordance with each other while uncong mc using five realizations results show large error and deviation especially for variance estimation as a result of the limited forward model runs in general the proposed tgnn mc method achieves an accurate uncertainty quantification estimation comparable to uncong mc using 20 000 realizations but with significantly improved efficiency only with the cost of five forward model runs in the training process in contrast uncong mc using the same number of forward model runs five fails to capture the true uncertainty statistics of the pressure field or bhp uncertainty quantification results using the previously trained cnn surrogate model for case 1 are shown in figs a1 and a2 in appendix a for comparison similar accuracy to tgcnn is observed regarding the mean and variance estimation of the overall pressure field however larger error occurs when estimating well production uncertainties for case 2 the prediction of pressure distribution of 20 000 permeability fields in 20 timesteps takes approximately 95 min for tgcnn mc while it takes 130 h 5 5 d for uncong mc uncertainty quantification results mean and variance of pressure in the entire field at three timesteps are shown in fig 17 and fig 18 fig 19 shows the well flow rate uncertainty analysis of the four producing wells in this case uncong mc using 30 forward model runs results in much larger error in both mean and variance estimation of the pressure field than tgcnn mc using the same number of forward model runs especially for variance estimation for both cases 1 and 2 uncong mc using the same number of forward model runs as tgcnn mc in the training process fails to capture the uncertainty accurately on the other hand tgcnn mc achieves comparable accuracy with uncong mc using 20 000 realizations at the cost of very limited forward model computation 5 and 30 for cases 1 and 2 respectively uncertainty quantification results using the previously trained cnn surrogate model for case 2 are shown in figs a3 and a4 in appendix a in this case much larger error is observed for cnn compared to tgcnn regarding uncertainty analysis of either the overall pressure field or the production rate indicating that case 2 is a harder problem to learn for data driven cnns than case 1 furthermore a significant checker board effect can be observed for pressure field estimation using cnn while incorporating theoretical guidance reduces such effect to a minimum 6 inverse modeling we consider the inverse modeling problem for case 2 to infer the permeability field based on observation data of well production rates well bhp known statistics of the permeability field and local known permeability of the perforated grids along the well direction which may be obtained by logging tools or core analysis we start with a simple case in which the statistics of the permeability field are known to be ln k 4 md and σ ln k 2 0 5 and the correlation length is η x η y η z 152 4 m the well production data are assumed to have been recorded in the first 10 d 10 noise is added for practical consideration δ t 1 d total production time 20 d and the permeability of the grids penetrated by the wells is assumed to be known the goal is to infer the permeability field based on available data and predict the well production in the next 10 d the parameters used in the pso algorithm are presented in table 9 the optimization function fitness value is defined as follows 18 fv λ 1 n t n well i 1 n t j 1 n well q j i q ref j i 2 λ 2 n well n k i 1 n well j 1 n k k j i k ref j i 2 λ 3 n t n w e l l i 1 n t j 1 n w e l l b h p j i b h p r e f j i 2 where q is the well flow rate k is the permeability of the well grid n k is the total number of grids for a well that has permeability measurement data here n k 10 the subscript ref indicates the observed known value and λ is the weight of each term subject to the numerical value of the term and the reliability of the observation here we set λ 1 1 λ 2 1000 and λ 3 10 the parameters to be optimized are the 13 random numbers ξ i i 1 2 13 used to generate the permeability field via kle the initial population of the swarm particles is generated randomly and the optimization terminates in 30 steps which takes approximately 12 min using the trained surrogate model on a single gpu the variation of the fitness value during the optimization process is shown in fig 20 the fitness value converges rapidly in the first several iterations we also used uncong pso to solve the inverse problem and it takes approximately 5 5 h to complete the task which is approximately 30 times longer than using tgcnn pso the reference and inferred permeability fields from tgcnn pso and uncong pso are shown in fig 21 although noisy observation data in limited spatial and temporal domains are taken for the inverse modeling problem the inverted permeability field from tgcnn pso is qualitatively consistent with the result from uncong pso and both are generally in good agreement with the reference particularly the high permeability zones in the upper left corner and middle right are captured accurately using the inverted permeability fields we calculate the flow rates of the four wells in 20 d and the results are shown in fig 22 good agreement with the reference data in the first 10 d is observed although the observation data are markedly noisy furthermore the prediction of well production in the last 10 d is also close to the reference indicating the reliability of the permeability field inversion at least for well production estimation the consistency between tgcnn pso and uncong pso demonstrates the reliability of our surrogate model with significantly improved computational efficiency the noticeable discrepancy between the inversion results of tgcnn pso and uncong pso is in part due to the systematic error of the tgcnn surrogate model since it is only a proxy of the forward model on the other hand it should be mentioned that inverse problems usually do not guarantee unique solutions for this case the problem is particularly ill posed since production data from only four well locations are available while the entire permeability field is to be inferred therefore multiple permeability fields with generally similar macro features but possible local heterogeneities may all lead to satisfactory agreement with history production data as shown in fig 21 and fig 22 similar observations are also reported by wang et al 2021d in which different inversion models result in noticeably different inversion results in fact as a result of the randomness of the particle initialization and updating processes even the same forward model may lead to different inversion results when running multiple times to improve the uniqueness of the solution more observation points or longer history production data are required we then consider a case in which only the mean value of the permeability field is known to be ln k 4 md while the variance and correlation length are unknown which shall also be inferred from the observation data here we generate the observation data using a realization of the stochastic permeability field with σ ln k 2 0 6 and η x η y η z 170 m similarly the flow rate data from the first 10 d are extracted and biased with 10 noise as the observation data the parameters to be optimized include the random variable ξ i σ ln k 2 and η similar parameters to those in table 9 are used in the pso algorithm in this case except that we increase the size of the particle population and iteration steps to 30 and 50 respectively to increase the probability of finding the global minimum and we constrain the searching limits for σ ln k 2 and η to be 0 1 and 130 190 respectively the optimization process takes approximately 2 h for tgcnn pso and the variation of the fitness value during the optimization process is shown in fig 23 for uncong pso it takes approximately 32 h to finish the task the computational efficiency of tgcnn pso is not as high as the former case because a considerable amount of computational time is occupied by the generation of permeability fields for which eigenvalues and eigenvectors need to be recalculated each time since the corresponding statistics σ ln k 2 and η also vary in this case the reference and inferred permeability fields from tgcnn pso and uncong pso are shown in fig 24 in this case the inferred permeability field closely resembles the reference except in the middle region where there are no observation data both tgcnn pso and uncong pso present similar results the inferred values for σ ln k 2 and η are 0 53 and 180 respectively both of which are close to the reference values using the optimized permeability field we calculate the flow rates of the four wells in 20 d and the results are presented in fig 25 good agreement with the reference production data in the first 10 d is observed despite the noisy observation data and the prediction of well production in the last 10 d is accurate as well although part of the statistics of the permeability field is unknown which dramatically increases the size of the searching space tgcnn pso provides satisfactory inversion results comparable to uncong pso but with improved computational efficiency 7 discussion the incorporation of theoretical guidance improves the accuracy and generalizability of the data driven surrogate model and alleviates its dependence on the quantity and quality of the training dataset when enough high quality data are provided data driven cnn can be used to provide an overall estimation of the pressure field at the cost of large computational burden for both data acquisition and model training and likely low local accuracy at the sources sinks or discontinuous zones however when the data are limited or corrupted with noise or the well production statistics are of more interest it is necessary to apply theoretical guidance to achieve more reliable results we use pso for inverse problems in this study which is due to its effectiveness for optimization problems and it is easy to implement pso is used only for the purpose of demonstration while other inverse modeling methods such as ensemble karman filter geostatistical methods and markov chain monte carlo mcmc among many others emerick and reynolds 2013 kitanidis and lee 2014 wang et al 2021d zha et al 2018 can be used some of which are based on bayesian algorithms and uncertainties regarding the inversion can be estimated because all of these methods require repeated runs of forward models the efficient and accurate surrogates provided by tgcnn can reduce their computational burden to the minimum we have performed hyperparameter tuning regarding the weights of the terms in the loss function in addition we have tested a small range of neural network architectures we found that the performance of the neural network is much more sensitive to the hyperparameters than the network architecture the weights λ1 λ2 λ3 of the loss terms are manually tuned beforehand and then kept constant during the training process a basic guideline when coarse tuning these hyperparameters is to keep the order of magnitude of the corresponding loss terms in the loss function to be roughly the same therefore balancing the contribution of each term then we fine tune these parameters by trial and error the influences of these hyperparameters are nontrivial to be determined quantitatively since the training process has certain randomness in a qualitative manner the larger is a hyperparameter the more weight is put on the corresponding loss term in the training process leading to more accurate estimation of that specific term for example a larger λ 1 may lead to overfitting the data mismatch term leaving the theoretical guidance term less effective therefore the trained surrogate model may have good performance on the training set while the generalization ability to the testing set is poor since our focus here is proposing a way of incorporating theoretical guidance into the traditional data driven cnn architecture we attempted to keep our comparison as concise and necessary as possible i e only between tgcnn and cnn we agree that other data driven approaches such as fourier neural network fno wen et al 2021b may achieve better performance than cnn but it is beyond the scope of this work to compare the performance using other data driven neural networks the major advantage of using our proposed method over conventional data driven approaches is that a small amount of labelled training data is required since the model training process is mainly guided by the incorporation of governing equations therefore reducing the acquisition cost or effort of the training data especially when the physical system is of high dimension or high fidelity on the other hand physics informed deep learning methods such as pinn raissi et al 2019 take location and time as inputs and utilize automatic differentiation techniques of most modern deep learning platforms to calculate the derivative terms in the governing equation however in our cases the inputs are image like and not continuous and therefore pinns are not suitable for the solution of our problems it should be mentioned that there is not a one fit for all machine learning approach and the design and application of deep learning models should be problem specific in our study here for example cnn demonstrates satisfactory learning capability of local features and the incorporation of theoretical guidance helps improve the robustness and generalizability of the trained surrogate model in the case of limited labelled training data however for low dimensional problems 2d or 1d in space pinn or tgnn has also been shown to provide satisfactory results on the other hand in the case of readily available labelled training data fno or specially designed cnn is applicable as well in this study we only consider gaussian permeability fields however non gaussian permeability fields or channelized fields are common in practice the resulting flow behavior is therefore more complicated to predict and requires a more sophisticated neural network architecture we defer treatment of more complicated non gaussian permeability fields to future work although only vertical wells are considered in this study the treatment of horizontal wells is straightforward and will be explored in future research furthermore here we consider single phase flow with only producing wells at the early development stage of an oil formation after the depletion of natural energy water is usually injected to maintain pressure and displace oil which results in two phase or multi phase flow problems surrogate models for such problems should predict not only pressures but also saturations of the formation neural networks with multiple outputs or multiple neural networks can be used for this purpose we will address two phase flow in subsequent work 8 conclusions we present the use of a theory guided convolutional encoder decoder neural network to build surrogate models for 3d dynamic subsurface fluid flow problems in a heterogeneous and stochastic permeability field with consideration of multiple producing wells at arbitrary locations with arbitrary penetration lengths theoretical guidance in the form of discretized pdes is constructed naturally using the input image grids and different well production controls constant pressure or flow rate can be handled effectively the surrogate models trained with theoretical guidance show improved accuracy and generalization ability compared to fully data driven cnns moreover tgcnn based surrogate models show good extrapolation ability to permeability fields with different statistics the uncertainty quantification examples demonstrate the superior computational efficiency of the surrogate model tens of times faster than numerical simulation tools such as uncong at a negligible cost of accuracy the surrogate models combined with the pso algorithm are also shown to constitute reliable tools for inverse modeling tasks in general tgcnn based surrogate models are efficient to train and accurate in prediction

problems appendix a herein we demonstrate the uncertainty quantification results using a data driven cnn with similar settings as those described in section 5 the results for both cases 1 and 2 are shown in comparison to the reference values 
2949,we build surrogate models for dynamic 3d subsurface single phase flow problems with multiple vertical producing wells the surrogate model provides efficient pressure estimation of the entire formation at any timestep given a stochastic permeability field arbitrary well locations and penetration lengths and a timestep matrix as inputs the well production rate or bottom hole pressure can then be determined based on peaceman s formula the original surrogate modeling task is transformed into an image to image regression problem using a convolutional encoder decoder neural network architecture the residual of the governing flow equation in its discretized form is incorporated into the loss function to impose theoretical guidance on the model training process as a result the accuracy and generalization ability of the trained surrogate models are significantly improved compared to those of fully data driven models they are also shown to possess flexible extrapolation ability to permeability fields with different statistics the surrogate models are used to conduct uncertainty quantification considering a stochastic permeability field as well as to infer unknown permeability information based on limited well production data and observation data of formation properties results are shown to be in close accordance with those of traditional numerical simulation tools but computational efficiency is dramatically improved keywords theory guided machine learning convolutional neural network surrogate modeling subsurface flow uncertainty quantification inverse problem data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the prediction of fluid transport in subsurface formations constitutes a non trivial task song et al 2016 xu et al 2020 yin et al 2020 partly due to incomplete knowledge of formation physical properties such as porosity and permeability therefore uncertainty quantification is usually desired prior to making production decisions zhang et al 2000 moreover it is often necessary to infer unknown parameter fields based on available production observation data i e inverse modeling problems or history matching chang et al 2010 and to predict future production the solution of both problems relies on accurate forward models that predict the dynamic pressure saturation distribution based on given initial ic and boundary conditions bc traditionally such forward models are constructed by numerical approaches such as finite difference finite volume or finite element methods aziz and settari 1979 these methods have successfully evolved over the past centuries and serve as reliable solvers for varieties of subsurface flow problems however they are not computationally efficient especially when solving large scale 3d problems on millions of grids nor are they flexible in handling problems with complex physics surrogate models on the other hand are desirable alternatives since they improve the efficiency of forward prediction at a minimal cost of accuracy by learning the correlation between inputs and outputs based on available data recently deep neural networks dnns have been widely utilized to build surrogate models due to their strong capability to learn complex correlations between inputs and outputs goodfellow et al 2016 kadeethum et al 2021 wen et al 2021a wen et al 2021b purely data driven dnns however possess limited generalization ability or they may make non physical predictions especially when the training data are of limited amount or of poor quality lecun et al 2015 theory guided machine learning emerged under such conditions karpatne et al 2017 raissi et al 2019 by incorporating physical laws ic bc constraints engineering controls or expert knowledge into the training process of dnns the robustness and generalization ability of the trained models are dramatically improved varieties of theory guided machine learning frameworks models have been proposed such as the theory guided data science tgds framework karpatne et al 2017 the physics informed neural network pinn raissi et al 2019 and the theory guided neural network tgnn wang et al 2020 or its weak form variant tgnn wf xu et al 2021a 2021b indeed they have achieved promising results in the solution of partial differential equations pdes raissi et al 2019 raissi and karniadakis 2018 inverse problems jo et al 2019 wang et al 2020 uncertainty quantification tripathy and bilionis 2018 wang et al 2021a and optimization tasks wang et al 2022 xu et al 2021a most of the works mentioned above constructed surrogate models based on fully connected neural networks fcnns it has been shown however that fcnns have limited performance when building high dimensional surrogate models mo et al 2019a zhu and zabaras 2018 furthermore the large parameter space as a result of deep network structures required to deal with complex problems increases the computational burden on the other hand convolutional neural networks cnns constitute promising alternatives image to image regression is more efficient to deal with high dimensional problems in addition the parameter sharing scheme of convolutional kernels dramatically reduces the size of the parameter space recently the data driven convolutional encoder decoder architecture has been frequently used to build surrogate models for subsurface flow and contaminant transport problems jin et al 2020 mo et al 2020 2019b zhu and zabaras 2018 however few attempts have been made to incorporate theoretical guidance into the training process of cnns zhu et al 2019 proposed a physics constrained encoder decoder network that utilized the sobel filter gao et al 2010 to approximate the spatial gradients but the temporal gradients could not be obtained therefore only steady state problems were studied in their work wang et al 2021b developed a theory guided autoencoder tgae framework that utilizes the discrete finite difference scheme to impose theoretical guidance which can approximate both spatial and temporal gradients but only 2d problems were probed without consideration of sources sinks subsequently they proposed a theory guided cnn tgcnn framework based on tgae and studied 2d problems with consideration of producing wells wang et al 2022 2021c in this work we modify the tgcnn framework to solve 3d problems the major novelty and contribution of this work is the proposition of a way to incorporate governing physics based on the finite difference method for 3d subsurface hydrology problems into the surrogate model training process especially the way to handle producing wells penetrating the formation at arbitrary lengths and to properly incorporate complex bcs and ics thus reducing the data dependence of conventional data driven neural networks while improving accuracy the major difference of this work compared to the theory guided machine learning works reported on 2d problems e g wang et al 2021c is fourfold 1 for 3d problems gravity is considered in our case which complicates the governing equation necessitating the definition of a potential function instead of pressure as in 2d problems 2 we consider a more complicated case for the production well which can penetrate the formation at arbitrary lengths in the vertical direction while for 2d problems the well is only considered as a point sink for 3d problems the flow rate or bottom hole pressure along each perforated grid of a production well are functions of formation properties such as permeability which is also more complicated than 2d cases 3 the treatment of reservoir boundary grids is more delicate for 3d problems which not only have line boundaries but also face boundary and point boundary grids each of which requires different treatment of the governing equations and 4 for initial conditions in our cases the formation is equilibrated with gravity rather than a uniform initial condition as for 2d problems reported by wang et al 2021c in this study we use the modified tgcnn to build surrogate models for dynamic subsurface flow problems with local sinks producing wells using limited training data uncertainty quantification and inverse modeling tasks are investigated using the constructed surrogate models which will be shown to have superior efficiency at a minimal cost of accuracy compared to conventional numerical simulation tools the remainder of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 we describe the forward and inverse problems formulation regarding 3d single phase flow with multiple producing wells which are commonly encountered in the early development stage of an oil formation in section 3 we briefly introduce the architecture of the convolutional encoder decoder network for surrogate modeling and the method to incorporate theoretical guidance via discretizing the governing equations we also demonstrate the inverse modeling technique particle swarm optimization used in this study in section 4 we demonstrate the construction of surrogate models based on tgcnn and show their accuracy and extrapolation ability compared to data driven cnns in sections 5 and 6 we design several case studies using the surrogate models to solve uncertainty quantification and inverse modeling problems and demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of tgcnn compared to numerical simulation tools in section 7 we discuss limitations of the proposed method suggest directions for future work and conclude the study 2 problem description 2 1 governing equations we consider a petroleum formation saturated with oil at the early development stage drilled with multiple producing wells the single phase oil transport equation considering the gravity effect can be written as follows 1 ρ k μ p ρ g q ρ ϕ t where ρ is the oil density k is the permeability μ is the oil viscosity p is the oil pressure g is the gravity factor ϕ is the porosity and q is the mass flow rate of oil at the producing wells by introducing the formation factor b o the oil compressibility factor c o and defining the oil potential φ p ρ g z eq 1 can be rewritten in 3d 2 x k x μ b o φ x y k y μ b o φ y z k z μ b o φ z q sc ϕ c o b o φ t where q sc is the oil producing volumetric flow rate at standard conditions 2 2 uncertainty quantification when the parameters in eq 2 are random fields a stochastic pde is formulated and the solution is no longer deterministic uncertainty quantification tasks arise so that the statistics of the solution e g mean and variance can be estimated herein we treat the permeability field k as a random field obeying a certain probability distribution function p k ω let η x t k x denote the solution of the stochastic pde the mean and variance of η can then be obtained as follows 3 1 μ x t ω η x t k x p k d k 3 2 σ 2 x t ω η x t k x μ x t 2 p k d k 2 3 inverse modeling the prediction of dynamic pressure distribution given a realization of the permeability field at fixed ic bc and well controls wcs e g producing at a certain flow rate or bottom hole pressure bhp formulates the following forward problem 4 f k i c b c w c p x t the corresponding inverse problem is defined as 5 k f 1 p i c b c w c i e to resolve the unknown permeability field based on observation data of pressure ic bc and wcs in practice however measurement of the pressure distribution of the entire formation is not feasible and usually the observation data are limited to the vicinity of wells such as well producing rates bhps and local permeability data obtained by well logging or core analysis techniques the inverse modeling task based on these limited data is therefore more challenging and the solution might not be unique 3 methodology 3 1 convolutional encoder decoder network for surrogate modeling we use a convolutional encoder decoder network to approximate the complex correlation between the inputs and outputs of the forward model eq 4 i e building surrogate models without solving the equation the original surrogate modeling task in the continuous spatial and temporal domains is transformed into an image to image regression problem by discretizing the problem on a mesh grid similar to that used in numerical approaches such as the finite difference method for the 3d problem in which we are interested the regression function can be written as 6 η ℝ n x h l w ℝ n y h l w where h l and w represent the number of grid points along the height length and width dimension respectively and n x and n y represent the number of input and output channels respectively here we have two input channels n x 2 including the discretized permeability field k r h l w and the time matrix of the same size t r h l w with each element being the same timestep t i at which the pressure is to be predicted the output channel n y 1 is the pressure field p r h l w at timestep t i the encoder decoder network has been widely employed for image reconstruction and regression modeling tasks for image type inputs and outputs goodfellow et al 2016 here we use the autoencoder architecture wang et al 2021b shown in fig 1 which is a special type of encoder decoder network the encoder component extracts high level coarse features from input images by performing a sequence of convolutional operations the fully connected layer transforms the output from the encoder component to a latent vector i e the codes the decoder component then reconstructs the output based on the codes by performing deconvolutional operations the weights and biases of the convolutional filters and the fully connected layers are the major parameters denoted as θ that need to be optimized during the training process so that the following loss function is minimized 7 loss data θ i 1 n k j 1 n t η k i t i η k i t i θ 2 2 where η and η are reference values and network predictions respectively and n k and n t are the total number of permeability field realizations and the number of timesteps used to calculate the pressure distributions respectively which constitutes the training dataset the optimization task min loss data θ can be conducted by different algorithms such as stochastic gradient descent sgd or adaptive moment estimation adam lecun et al 2015 3 2 theory guided training the training process described in section 3 1 is fully data driven and therefore depends highly on the amount and quality of the training data to achieve reasonable interpolation abilities however when there are limited or low quality training data the performance of data driven models is not guaranteed here we introduce the concept of theory guided training in which known governing equations pdes can be used to guide the training process raissi et al 2019 wang et al 2020 xu et al 2021b specifically the pde residual approximated by the neural network can be added to the loss function and minimized during the training so that the model prediction not only follows the patterns learned from the training data but also obeys physical laws imposed by pdes as a result the data dependence of the neural network training process is alleviated which is especially beneficial in this case since 3d large scale numerical simulations are time consuming the discretized eq 2 in the fully implicit scheme on the cartesian grids of the input images can be written as 8 k x μ b o i 1 2 j k φ i 1 j k n 1 φ i j k n 1 δ x 2 k x μ b o i 1 2 j k φ i j k n 1 φ i 1 j k n 1 δ x 2 k y μ b o i j 1 2 k φ i j 1 k n 1 φ i j k n 1 δ y 2 k y μ b o i j 1 2 k φ i j k n 1 φ i j 1 k n 1 δ y 2 k z μ b o i j k 1 2 φ i j k 1 n 1 φ i j k n 1 δ

coordinate δ x δ y a n d δ z are the grid intervals in x y a n d z directions respectively and δ t is the time interval the inter grid permeability is calculated as the harmonic mean of the two neighboring grids for vertical wells producing at a constant flow rate the individual flow rate at each perforated grid is allocated based on its permeability q i q sc k i i 1 n p k i where k i is the permeability of the ith perforated grid and n p is the total number of perforated grids of that well along the vertical direction for wells producing at a constant bhp the flow rate of the ith perforated grid is calculated based on peaceman s formula aziz and settari 1979 9 q i 2 π δ z k x k y μ ln r 0 r w p well i b h p where p well i is the pressure of the ith perforated grid r w is the wellbore radii and r 0 is the radii of the effect drainage area which is defined as follows 10 r 0 0 28 k y δ x 2 k x δ y 2 k x k y the flow rate of the well is then the summation of all perforated grids the pde residual r loss can be calculated from the neural network approximation of eq 8 11 1 loss pde θ m 1 n k v n 1 n t v r k m t n θ 2 2 11 2 r k m t n θ 1 n g i j k n g k x μ b o i 1 2 j k η

θ i j k η k m t n δ t θ i j k δ t where n k v and n t v are the number of realizations of stochastic permeability fields and the number of timesteps respectively used to enforce pde constraints and n g is the total number of spatial grids inside of the computational domain for the no flow boundary conditions considered here the loss function for the bc loss bc θ takes the same form as eq 11 except that it is only evaluated on the boundary grids and the potential values of the grids outside of the domain are treated the same as their nearest neighbors on the boundaries so that no flow across the boundaries might occur it is worth noting that this set of realizations n k v shares the same statistical properties as the training ones n k but is generated with a different random seed they are not intended for pressure calculation to provide labelled training data but are only used to calculate the pde and bc residuals to enforce the physical constraints we will later refer to such set of permeability fields as virtual permeability fields commonly we generate more virtual permeability fields than the training ones due to two reasons 1 the acquisition of labelled training data using uncong is time consuming while the generation of virtual permeability fields is trivial and 2 the labelled training data are only intended to provide certain guidance in the model training process so that the model can learn better based on theoretical guidance on the virtual permeability fields in other words the model training process is in essence a pde solution learning process applied on the virtual permeability fields as long as there are enough representative virtual permeability fields used in the model training process the generalizability of the trained model to unseen permeability fields with similar statistics can be enhanced the initial condition is imposed in a hard manner via transforming the original network output η 0 in the following way to obtain the updated output η 12 η φ 0 1 t t η 0 so that at initial state t 0 the network output is guaranteed to be the specified initial potential φ 0 the total loss is then defined as the summation of data mismatch and pde residual which is calculated based on the updated output η eq 12 from the decoder 13 loss λ 1 l o s s data θ λ 2 l o s s pde θ λ 3 l o s s bc θ where λ 1 λ 2 and λ 3 are the weights lagrange multipliers of the corresponding losses to softly enforce the physical constraints 3 3 stochastic permeability fields generation a series of stochastic permeability fields need to be generated to enforce theoretical guidance in the training process so that a reliable surrogate model can be built that extrapolates to other permeability fields with similar statistics here we consider gaussian type permeability fields and use karhunen loeve expansion kle chang and zhang 2015 zhang and lu 2004 to parameterize the random field for a gaussian random field z x τ ln k x τ where x is the spatial domain and τ is the probability space it can be expressed as z x τ z x z x τ where z x is the average value of the random field and z x τ is the fluctuation the spatial structure of the random field can be described by the two point covariance function c z x x z x τ z x τ using kle the random field can be decomposed as ghanem and spanos 2003 14 z x τ z x i 1 λ i f i x ξ i τ where λ i and f i are the ith eigenvalue and eigenfunction of the covariance respectively and ξ i is a gaussian random variable with zero mean and unit variance for separable exponential covariance function c z x x σ z 2 exp x 1 x 2 η x y 1 y 2 η y z 1 z 2 η z where σ z 2 and η are the variance and correlation length of the random field respectively the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions can be solved analytically or semi analytically the details of which can be found in zhang and lu 2004 practically we truncate eq 15 by the first several terms and therefore a random field can be generated using a collection of ξ 3 4 particle swarm optimization for inverse problems particle swarm optimization pso is a stochastic population based optimization method proposed by kennedy and eberhart 1995 it simulates animals social behavior such as birds and fish of food hunting in a cooperative way specifically it solves an optimization problem by having a population of candidate particles moving around in the search space to find the minimum fitness value or the function to be minimized each particle s movement is influenced by its local best position as well as the best positions of the entire population so that the swarm is expected to move towards the best solutions the major advantage of pso compared to other gradient based approaches such as gradient descent or newton methods is that pso does not require the problem to be differentiable bonyadi and michalewicz 2017 the position and velocity of the particles in pso are iteratively updated based on the following formula 15 1 v i n 1 ω v i n c 1 r 1 n p b e s t i n x i n c 2 r 2 n g b e s t n x i n 15 2 x i n 1 x i n v i n 1 where v i n and x i n are the velocity and location of the ith particle at the nth iteration respectively pbes t i n is the local best known location of the ith particle gbes t n is the global best location of the entire species at the nth iteration c 1 and c 2 are the learning rates r 1 n and r 2 n are two sets of random numbers and ω is the inertia weight which is used to control the influence of the previous velocity value on the updated velocity shi and eberhart 1998 4 surrogate models construction using tgcnn we consider a 3d formation saturated with oil the geometrical and petrophysical properties of the formation and the oil within are shown in table 1 we assume that the stochastic permeability field k obeys a lognormal distribution with ln k 4 md σ ln k 2 0 5 and the correlation length is set to be η x η y η z 152 4 m we truncate eq 15 with the first 13 terms which reserves 60 of the energy the random field can then be reconstructed using 13 independent random variables ξ i i 1 2 13 the 3d formation is discretized into 60 220 and 10 grids in x y and z directions respectively four producing wells are placed near the four corners of the formation and the wells penetrate and perforate the entire formation in the vertical direction fig 2 shows three example realizations of permeability fields and the corresponding well locations the initial pressure of the formation is gravitationally stabilized and the reference pressure at the top of the formation is 413 69 bar the boundaries of the formation are treated as no flow bcs two types of well control operations are considered including constant flow rate 50 m3 d std case 1 and constant bhp 350 bar case 2 both conditions are commonly used in field operations and they require different treatments in the formulation of theoretical guidance we consider the calculation of the pressure distribution of the formation in 20 timesteps with each timestep representing either 3 days for case 1 or 1 day for case 2 the reference solution of the problem is obtained using uncong software li et al 2015 while many other numerical simulation tools can also be used the detailed convolutional encoder decoder network architecture designed for the surrogate modeling task is shown in fig 3 the input images consist of two channels including the permeability field and time matrix in the encoder component 3d convolutional filters with different sizes and strides are applied followed by the swish activation function to reduce the input dimension and extract local features a fc layer follows the encoder component with a single hidden layer and no activation function to encode the information into the latent variables the hidden layer latent space has a dimension of 100 neurons the decoder component performs a series of deconvolutional operations followed by the elu activation function to produce the output pressure images 4 1 surrogate modeling for case 1 constant flow rate in this case we consider the four wells all producing at a constant flow rate of 50 m3 d std the training parameters for case 1 are listed in table 2 for comparison we also trained a data driven cnn using similar settings the training time using the cnn for case 1 takes approximately 22 min on 4 nvidia v100 gpus it should be noted that the time required to prepare the training data depends on the size of the dataset in our cases for example obtaining the pressure data for 50 stochastic permeability fields using uncong it takes approximately 20 min for either case 1 or 2 on an intel r xeon r gold 6240 cpu the trained surrogate model is then tested on 50 stochastic permeability fields generated using a different random seed from the training set the accuracy of the surrogate model prediction compared to reference values is evaluated using two criteria i e the relative l 2 error and the coefficient of determination r 2 score which are defined as follows 16 l 2 η nn η 2 η 2 17 r 2 1 i 1 n r η i nn η i 2 i 1 n r η i η 2 where 2 represents the standard euclidean norm n r is the total number of evaluation points for r 2 and η is the average value of η and η can be either the pressure or well flow rate bhp the accuracy of the surrogate model is evaluated on each of the permeability fields in the training and testing sets the results of which are shown in the boxplots in fig 4 for comparison we also show the results using the fully data driven cnn with the same network architecture and training parameters as shown in fig 4 both tgcnn and cnn have comparable accuracy and good extrapolation ability when evaluated on the entire pressure fields cnn predictions of well bhp however are not accurate even on the training set and the results are much worse than tgcnn on the testing set in terms of the mean and variance of the relative l 2 error or r 2 score the prediction of bhp or well flow rate depends highly on the prediction accuracy of the pressure of the grids penetrated by the well without theoretical guidance cnn minimizes the mean prediction error of the entire grids of the input images while the local grids containing the well might have larger errors than the other ones the errors propagate to the calculation of bhp or well flow rate based on peaceman s formula leading to poor prediction accuracy of cnn on the other hand when theoretical guidance is enforced additional physical constraints are implemented on the grids containing the well leading to more accurate prediction of their pressures therefore incorporating theoretical guidance into the training process assists to capture local fluctuations pressure disturbance caused by sources sinks more effectively as an example fig 5 shows the reference and tgcnn predicted pressure distribution at three timesteps for a permeability field drawn from the testing set top left field in fig 2 tgcnn predictions are close to the reference values with negligible absolute error the largest error occurs at the corners of the formation one possible explanation for such behavior is the difficulty in the proper implementation of no flow boundary conditions even for numerical approaches furthermore the residuals of the governing equation on the boundary and internal grids are calculated separately which does not guarantee equal performance fig 6 shows the well bhp variation along the production timeline estimated by tgcnn and cnn based surrogate models good agreement with the reference values is observed for tgcnn while cnn results are constantly divergent by a certain degree 4 2 surrogate modeling for case 2 constant bhp in this case we consider the four wells all producing at a constant bhp of 350 bar the training parameters for case 2 are listed in table 3 for comparison we also trained a data driven cnn using similar settings the training time using the cnn for case 2 takes approximately 38 min on 4 nvidia v100 gpus the trained surrogate model is tested on 50 stochastic permeability fields generated using a different random seed from the training set the accuracy of the surrogate model is evaluated on each of the permeability fields in the training and testing sets the results of which are presented in the boxplots in fig 7 for comparison results using the fully data driven cnn are shown as well different from case 1 although both cnn and tgcnn have high accuracy on the training set for the entire pressure fields the extrapolation ability of cnn to the testing set is poor with larger variance in accuracy on the other hand tgcnn has high accuracy on both the training and test sets with r 2 score close to 1 for well flow rate prediction the advantage of using tgcnn is more obvious cnn has low accuracy on both the training and testing set with a mean r 2 score of approximately 0 6 and several extreme cases with r 2 score close to 0 while tgcnn significantly outperforms cnn with r 2 score close to 1 this indicates that data driven cnn surrogate models only ensure global accuracy at the cost of local accuracy and possess limited extrapolation ability to inputs not seen previously incorporating theoretical guidance improves the models generalization ability and assists the models to better capture local fluctuations discontinuities as an example fig 8 shows the reference and tgcnn predicted pressure distribution at three timesteps for a permeability field drawn from the testing set top left field in fig 2 tgcnn predictions are close to the reference values with negligible absolute error similar to case 1 the largest error occurs at the corners of the formation fig 9 shows the well flow rate variation along the production timeline tgcnn shows good agreement with the reference values while cnn consistently overestimates the well flow rates 4 3 generalization ability of the surrogate models here we test the generalization ability of the trained surrogate model to permeability fields with different statistics for the sake of brevity we only consider producing wells with constant bhp we first keep the mean and correlation length of the stochastic permeability field to be constant as used in section 4 2 ln k 4 md η 152 4 m and vary the variance of the permeability five cases are considered with σ ln k 2 0 1 0 3 0 5 0 7 and 0 9 for each case 50 stochastic permeability fields are generated and the pressure distribution over 20 timesteps is predicted using the same tgcnn surrogate model in section 4 2 which was trained based on the case with σ ln k 2 0 5 the prediction accuracy of the pressure and well flow rates is quantified as shown in fig 10 in comparison to uncong simulation results it can be seen that the generalization ability of the surrogate model to permeability fields with smaller variances σ ln k 2 0 5 is much better than larger ones σ ln k 2 0 5 which is as expected since permeability fields with larger variances introduce stronger heterogeneity and the surrogate model may struggle to handle out of distribution inputs permeability values in general the accuracy of the surrogate model increases with the decrease in σ ln k 2 and the surrogate model can be trusted to provide reliable predictions for permeability fields with σ ln k 2 0 7 with r 2 0 98 we then keep the mean and variance of the stochastic permeability field to be constant ln k 4 md σ ln k 2 0 5 and vary the correlation length five cases are considered with η 100 130 152 170 and 200 m for each case 50 stochastic permeability fields are generated and the pressure distribution over 20 timesteps is predicted using the same tgcnn surrogate model trained based on the case with η 152 m the prediction accuracy of the pressure and well flow rates is quantified as shown in fig 11 in comparison to uncong simulation results the generalization ability of the surrogate model to permeability fields with larger correlation length η 152 m is much better than smaller ones η 152 m which is as expected since permeability fields with smaller correlation length introduce more complicated local patterns that are not learned by the convolutional filters in general the accuracy of the surrogate model increases with correlation length and the surrogate model can be trusted to provide reliable predictions for permeability fields with η 130 m with r 2 0 93 4 4 surrogate modeling for more heterogeneous permeability fields to further improve the generalization ability of the surrogate model to more heterogeneous permeability fields we demonstrate another example of training the neural network on stochastic permeability fields with a larger variance 1 0 and smaller correlation length 50 which is approximately 7 14 of the domain the training parameters are listed in table 4 the trained surrogate model is tested on 50 stochastic permeability fields generated using a different random seed from the training set the overall r 2 for the pressure and well production rates estimation are 0 982 and 0 991 respectively indicating good extrapolation ability of the surrogate model in contrast the surrogate model trained only based on the labelled training dataset results in much lower accuracy the overall r 2 for pressure and well production rates estimation are 0 765 and 0 553 respectively as an example we demonstrate in fig 12 the comparison of pressure and well production rates estimation between the surrogate model and uncong simulation for three testing permeability fields for all three cases tgcnn predicted pressure and well production rates align closely with the reference values we then conduct a similar extrapolation ability test to that in section 4 3 using the newly trained surrogate model a wider range of parameter ranges are tested and the results are shown in table 5 and table 6 we only show well production rates estimation results here for the sake of brevity and similar trends are observed for the overall pressure estimation since the current model is trained using more heterogeneous permeability fields it demonstrates more flexible generalization ability to a wider range of stochastic permeability fields with different variances or correlation lengths in this case satisfying results can be obtained for variance up to 2 0 and correlation length down to 20 0 approximately 3 to 6 of the domain 4 5 surrogate modeling for varying well locations and penetration lengths here we consider a more complex situation in which it is desired to estimate the pressure profile and well production rates assuming constant bhp given not only a stochastic permeability field but also arbitrary well locations and well penetration lengths the total number of wells remains the same in this way a more general surrogate model can be constructed to provide efficient uncertainty quantification and inverse modeling tasks for different well patterns without the need to retrain the model moreover such a model is also useful for optimization of the well location or pumping rates to achieve the highest cumulative production in this case an additional input channel is needed which provides well locations and penetration lengths information here we construct a 3d well image which is a binary image of the same size as the permeability image the image grids containing the wells of arbitrary location and penetration length take the value of one while the other grids take the value of zero the network structure is the same as that in previous cases with only an additional input channel the training parameters are listed in table 7 the trained surrogate model is tested on 50 stochastic permeability fields with random well locations and penetration lengths generated using a different random seed from the training set the overall r 2 for the pressure and well production rates are 0 994 and 0 996 respectively indicating good extrapolation ability of the surrogate model as an example we demonstrate in fig 13 the comparison of pressure and well production rates estimation between the surrogate model and uncong simulation for three different testing cases with detailed well location and penetration length information presented in table 8 for all three cases tgcnn predicted pressure and well production rates align closely with the reference values indicating good generalizability of the surrogate model not only to permeability fields with similar statistics but also to arbitrary combinations of well locations and penetration lengths 5 uncertainty quantification using the constructed surrogate model introduced in section 4 we perform uncertainty quantification of the pressure of the entire field producing well bhps for case 1 and well flow rates for case 2 we assume that the statistics of the permeability field are known beforehand with ln k 4 md σ ln k 2 0 5 and the correlation length is η x η y η z 152 4 m the well locations and penetration lengths are the same as those in section 4 1 the statistical results are analyzed using 20 000 randomly generated permeability fields sampled by the monte carlo method which we refer to as tgcnn mc the same procedures are also performed using uncong software the results of which are taken as the reference values which we refer to as uncong mc for comparison we also calculated the statistics using uncong mc with the same number of forward numerical model runs as used in the tgcnn based surrogate modeling training process 5 and 30 realizations for cases 1 and 2 respectively see table 2 for case 1 the prediction of pressure distribution of 20 000 permeability fields in 20 timesteps takes approximately 90 min for tgcnn mc while it takes about 120 h 5 d for uncong mc to finish the same calculation note that the prediction processes herein and thereafter for tgcnn mc and uncong mc are both conducted on an intel r xeon r gold 6240 cpu the efficiency of the surrogate model even with consideration of training time 38 min is 50 times faster than traditional numerical simulation tools such as uncong uncertainty quantification results mean and variance of pressure in the entire field at three timesteps are shown in fig 14 and fig 15 good agreement with the reference uncong mc results using 20 000 realizations is observed for tgcnn mc however uncong mc using five realizations demonstrates noticeably large deviation from the reference and much larger error is observed around the wells fig 16 shows the well bhp uncertainty analysis of the four producing wells at each timestep the mean and variance of the estimated bhp by tgcnn mc and uncong mc using 20 000 realizations are in close accordance with each other while uncong mc using five realizations results show large error and deviation especially for variance estimation as a result of the limited forward model runs in general the proposed tgnn mc method achieves an accurate uncertainty quantification estimation comparable to uncong mc using 20 000 realizations but with significantly improved efficiency only with the cost of five forward model runs in the training process in contrast uncong mc using the same number of forward model runs five fails to capture the true uncertainty statistics of the pressure field or bhp uncertainty quantification results using the previously trained cnn surrogate model for case 1 are shown in figs a1 and a2 in appendix a for comparison similar accuracy to tgcnn is observed regarding the mean and variance estimation of the overall pressure field however larger error occurs when estimating well production uncertainties for case 2 the prediction of pressure distribution of 20 000 permeability fields in 20 timesteps takes approximately 95 min for tgcnn mc while it takes 130 h 5 5 d for uncong mc uncertainty quantification results mean and variance of pressure in the entire field at three timesteps are shown in fig 17 and fig 18 fig 19 shows the well flow rate uncertainty analysis of the four producing wells in this case uncong mc using 30 forward model runs results in much larger error in both mean and variance estimation of the pressure field than tgcnn mc using the same number of forward model runs especially for variance estimation for both cases 1 and 2 uncong mc using the same number of forward model runs as tgcnn mc in the training process fails to capture the uncertainty accurately on the other hand tgcnn mc achieves comparable accuracy with uncong mc using 20 000 realizations at the cost of very limited forward model computation 5 and 30 for cases 1 and 2 respectively uncertainty quantification results using the previously trained cnn surrogate model for case 2 are shown in figs a3 and a4 in appendix a in this case much larger error is observed for cnn compared to tgcnn regarding uncertainty analysis of either the overall pressure field or the production rate indicating that case 2 is a harder problem to learn for data driven cnns than case 1 furthermore a significant checker board effect can be observed for pressure field estimation using cnn while incorporating theoretical guidance reduces such effect to a minimum 6 inverse modeling we consider the inverse modeling problem for case 2 to infer the permeability field based on observation data of well production rates well bhp known statistics of the permeability field and local known permeability of the perforated grids along the well direction which may be obtained by logging tools or core analysis we start with a simple case in which the statistics of the permeability field are known to be ln k 4 md and σ ln k 2 0 5 and the correlation length is η x η y η z 152 4 m the well production data are assumed to have been recorded in the first 10 d 10 noise is added for practical consideration δ t 1 d total production time 20 d and the permeability of the grids penetrated by the wells is assumed to be known the goal is to infer the permeability field based on available data and predict the well production in the next 10 d the parameters used in the pso algorithm are presented in table 9 the optimization function fitness value is defined as follows 18 fv λ 1 n t n well i 1 n t j 1 n well q j i q ref j i 2 λ 2 n well n k i 1 n well j 1 n k k j i k ref j i 2 λ 3 n t n w e l l i 1 n t j 1 n w e l l b h p j i b h p r e f j i 2 where q is the well flow rate k is the permeability of the well grid n k is the total number of grids for a well that has permeability measurement data here n k 10 the subscript ref indicates the observed known value and λ is the weight of each term subject to the numerical value of the term and the reliability of the observation here we set λ 1 1 λ 2 1000 and λ 3 10 the parameters to be optimized are the 13 random numbers ξ i i 1 2 13 used to generate the permeability field via kle the initial population of the swarm particles is generated randomly and the optimization terminates in 30 steps which takes approximately 12 min using the trained surrogate model on a single gpu the variation of the fitness value during the optimization process is shown in fig 20 the fitness value converges rapidly in the first several iterations we also used uncong pso to solve the inverse problem and it takes approximately 5 5 h to complete the task which is approximately 30 times longer than using tgcnn pso the reference and inferred permeability fields from tgcnn pso and uncong pso are shown in fig 21 although noisy observation data in limited spatial and temporal domains are taken for the inverse modeling problem the inverted permeability field from tgcnn pso is qualitatively consistent with the result from uncong pso and both are generally in good agreement with the reference particularly the high permeability zones in the upper left corner and middle right are captured accurately using the inverted permeability fields we calculate the flow rates of the four wells in 20 d and the results are shown in fig 22 good agreement with the reference data in the first 10 d is observed although the observation data are markedly noisy furthermore the prediction of well production in the last 10 d is also close to the reference indicating the reliability of the permeability field inversion at least for well production estimation the consistency between tgcnn pso and uncong pso demonstrates the reliability of our surrogate model with significantly improved computational efficiency the noticeable discrepancy between the inversion results of tgcnn pso and uncong pso is in part due to the systematic error of the tgcnn surrogate model since it is only a proxy of the forward model on the other hand it should be mentioned that inverse problems usually do not guarantee unique solutions for this case the problem is particularly ill posed since production data from only four well locations are available while the entire permeability field is to be inferred therefore multiple permeability fields with generally similar macro features but possible local heterogeneities may all lead to satisfactory agreement with history production data as shown in fig 21 and fig 22 similar observations are also reported by wang et al 2021d in which different inversion models result in noticeably different inversion results in fact as a result of the randomness of the particle initialization and updating processes even the same forward model may lead to different inversion results when running multiple times to improve the uniqueness of the solution more observation points or longer history production data are required we then consider a case in which only the mean value of the permeability field is known to be ln k 4 md while the variance and correlation length are unknown which shall also be inferred from the observation data here we generate the observation data using a realization of the stochastic permeability field with σ ln k 2 0 6 and η x η y η z 170 m similarly the flow rate data from the first 10 d are extracted and biased with 10 noise as the observation data the parameters to be optimized include the random variable ξ i σ ln k 2 and η similar parameters to those in table 9 are used in the pso algorithm in this case except that we increase the size of the particle population and iteration steps to 30 and 50 respectively to increase the probability of finding the global minimum and we constrain the searching limits for σ ln k 2 and η to be 0 1 and 130 190 respectively the optimization process takes approximately 2 h for tgcnn pso and the variation of the fitness value during the optimization process is shown in fig 23 for uncong pso it takes approximately 32 h to finish the task the computational efficiency of tgcnn pso is not as high as the former case because a considerable amount of computational time is occupied by the generation of permeability fields for which eigenvalues and eigenvectors need to be recalculated each time since the corresponding statistics σ ln k 2 and η also vary in this case the reference and inferred permeability fields from tgcnn pso and uncong pso are shown in fig 24 in this case the inferred permeability field closely resembles the reference except in the middle region where there are no observation data both tgcnn pso and uncong pso present similar results the inferred values for σ ln k 2 and η are 0 53 and 180 respectively both of which are close to the reference values using the optimized permeability field we calculate the flow rates of the four wells in 20 d and the results are presented in fig 25 good agreement with the reference production data in the first 10 d is observed despite the noisy observation data and the prediction of well production in the last 10 d is accurate as well although part of the statistics of the permeability field is unknown which dramatically increases the size of the searching space tgcnn pso provides satisfactory inversion results comparable to uncong pso but with improved computational efficiency 7 discussion the incorporation of theoretical guidance improves the accuracy and generalizability of the data driven surrogate model and alleviates its dependence on the quantity and quality of the training dataset when enough high quality data are provided data driven cnn can be used to provide an overall estimation of the pressure field at the cost of large computational burden for both data acquisition and model training and likely low local accuracy at the sources sinks or discontinuous zones however when the data are limited or corrupted with noise or the well production statistics are of more interest it is necessary to apply theoretical guidance to achieve more reliable results we use pso for inverse problems in this study which is due to its effectiveness for optimization problems and it is easy to implement pso is used only for the purpose of demonstration while other inverse modeling methods such as ensemble karman filter geostatistical methods and markov chain monte carlo mcmc among many others emerick and reynolds 2013 kitanidis and lee 2014 wang et al 2021d zha et al 2018 can be used some of which are based on bayesian algorithms and uncertainties regarding the inversion can be estimated because all of these methods require repeated runs of forward models the efficient and accurate surrogates provided by tgcnn can reduce their computational burden to the minimum we have performed hyperparameter tuning regarding the weights of the terms in the loss function in addition we have tested a small range of neural network architectures we found that the performance of the neural network is much more sensitive to the hyperparameters than the network architecture the weights λ1 λ2 λ3 of the loss terms are manually tuned beforehand and then kept constant during the training process a basic guideline when coarse tuning these hyperparameters is to keep the order of magnitude of the corresponding loss terms in the loss function to be roughly the same therefore balancing the contribution of each term then we fine tune these parameters by trial and error the influences of these hyperparameters are nontrivial to be determined quantitatively since the training process has certain randomness in a qualitative manner the larger is a hyperparameter the more weight is put on the corresponding loss term in the training process leading to more accurate estimation of that specific term for example a larger λ 1 may lead to overfitting the data mismatch term leaving the theoretical guidance term less effective therefore the trained surrogate model may have good performance on the training set while the generalization ability to the testing set is poor since our focus here is proposing a way of incorporating theoretical guidance into the traditional data driven cnn architecture we attempted to keep our comparison as concise and necessary as possible i e only between tgcnn and cnn we agree that other data driven approaches such as fourier neural network fno wen et al 2021b may achieve better performance than cnn but it is beyond the scope of this work to compare the performance using other data driven neural networks the major advantage of using our proposed method over conventional data driven approaches is that a small amount of labelled training data is required since the model training process is mainly guided by the incorporation of governing equations therefore reducing the acquisition cost or effort of the training data especially when the physical system is of high dimension or high fidelity on the other hand physics informed deep learning methods such as pinn raissi et al 2019 take location and time as inputs and utilize automatic differentiation techniques of most modern deep learning platforms to calculate the derivative terms in the governing equation however in our cases the inputs are image like and not continuous and therefore pinns are not suitable for the solution of our problems it should be mentioned that there is not a one fit for all machine learning approach and the design and application of deep learning models should be problem specific in our study here for example cnn demonstrates satisfactory learning capability of local features and the incorporation of theoretical guidance helps improve the robustness and generalizability of the trained surrogate model in the case of limited labelled training data however for low dimensional problems 2d or 1d in space pinn or tgnn has also been shown to provide satisfactory results on the other hand in the case of readily available labelled training data fno or specially designed cnn is applicable as well in this study we only consider gaussian permeability fields however non gaussian permeability fields or channelized fields are common in practice the resulting flow behavior is therefore more complicated to predict and requires a more sophisticated neural network architecture we defer treatment of more complicated non gaussian permeability fields to future work although only vertical wells are considered in this study the treatment of horizontal wells is straightforward and will be explored in future research furthermore here we consider single phase flow with only producing wells at the early development stage of an oil formation after the depletion of natural energy water is usually injected to maintain pressure and displace oil which results in two phase or multi phase flow problems surrogate models for such problems should predict not only pressures but also saturations of the formation neural networks with multiple outputs or multiple neural networks can be used for this purpose we will address two phase flow in subsequent work 8 conclusions we present the use of a theory guided convolutional encoder decoder neural network to build surrogate models for 3d dynamic subsurface fluid flow problems in a heterogeneous and stochastic permeability field with consideration of multiple producing wells at arbitrary locations with arbitrary penetration lengths theoretical guidance in the form of discretized pdes is constructed naturally using the input image grids and different well production controls constant pressure or flow rate can be handled effectively the surrogate models trained with theoretical guidance show improved accuracy and generalization ability compared to fully data driven cnns moreover tgcnn based surrogate models show good extrapolation ability to permeability fields with different statistics the uncertainty quantification examples demonstrate the superior computational efficiency of the surrogate model tens of times faster than numerical simulation tools such as uncong at a negligible cost of accuracy the surrogate models combined with the pso algorithm are also shown to constitute reliable tools for inverse modeling tasks in general tgcnn based surrogate models are efficient to train and accurate in prediction
