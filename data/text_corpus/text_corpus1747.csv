8735,the extraction of olive oil generates considerable volumes of an agricultural by product olive mill wastewater omww which is damaging to the environment and biological life to investigate the effect of fermented omww on number of pods pod length pod weight dry weight of plant chlorophyll a chlorophyll b and total chlorophyll of common bean plants were grown and irrigated with various percentages of fermented omww 0 4 6 8 10 and 100 in a greenhouse the study found that irrigating agricultural land with a water mix containing a specified quantity of omww enhanced physicochemical parameters and influenced plant characteristics the plant characteristics were substantially affected when wastewater irrigated agricultural areas with water polluted with omww at concentrations no more than 4 according to the findings of this study utilizing 4 omww resulted in the best bean plant growth response with an increase in growth indices and photosynthetic pigments keywords olive mill wastewater plant growth biological life antibacterial activity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction olive mill wastewater omww is the liquid by product obtained from three phase solid aqueous oil olive oil extraction systems up to 30 million m3 omww is generated annually in the mediterranean region 1 typically the olive extraction process generates olive oil 20 32 aqu atic part 40 50 and biosolids production 30 2 most nations in the mediterranean region where 97 5 of the world s oil is produced rely heavily on olive oil production for socioeconomic growth 3 omww is a serious issue since it comprises a large amount of water as well as both organic substances and nutritious components omww consists of vegetation water tissues of olive fruits and process water used in different stages of the extraction therefore it has a high biological and chemical oxygen demand high concentrations of soluble phenolic compounds total phenols tp oil residues as well as the residual solid content total suspended solids and therefore it cannot be processed by conventional sewage treatment plants 4 in jordan omww is the most polluting activity in terms of discharge volume chemical content and or strength and if discharged into municipal sewers or surface waterways it will harm aquatic life as well as humans and the environment due to its elevated organic content phytotoxicity and antimicrobial properties 5 when put to the soil these wastes have a high fertilizer value due to their high organic matter concentration and some mineral nutrient content 6 additionally omww soil amendment is well known for its antibacterial activity and ability to reduce diseases in plants 7 as a result more focus has been made on discovering the best methods for distributing omww on agricultural lands and recycling both organic substances and nutritious components in the soil crop system 8 several studies have shown that a controlled distribution of omww over soil layer might be used as a composting approach 9 11 it has also been suggested that omww might be utilized as a low cost biofertilizer 12 food and clean water are the two most fundamental requirements for survival as a result offering both items to customers is the top priority and the major problem for the global economy a tremendous increase in global population along with urban growth has contributed to a significant increase in water and food usage while available resources have become increasingly scarce the gap between supply and demand for water is getting wider and has reached such alarming levels that it is facing a danger to human presence in some regions of the world when accessible water supplies are limited reusing omww effluent is an appealing alternative since it may reduce strain on water supplies while also providing an extra water resource agriculture consumes a lot of water contributing for more over 70 of overall water use in other areas like jordan 13 improved water planning in agriculture is critical to lowering usage minimizing network losses and reducing evaporation one of most common way for dealing with the challenges connected with that whole effluent is to apply it directly to cultivated soils as biofertilizer 3 utilizing its beneficial components would provide a different economically viable and environmentally friendly strategy to managing omww organic matter nutrients and water are all significant components of omww organic matter is crucial for a number of soil features including soil structure ion binding ph buffering and water retention when used at the right application rates omw can serve as a natural fertilizer and soil amendment 14 several studies were conducted regarding the use of treated water as an organic fertilizer 15 18 the application of omww fertilizer to the soil improves the chemical and physicochemical properties of the soil blankes et al 2002 on the other hand the results of experiments conducted on some plants that used omww bio fertilizer to increase agricultural productivity showed that the yield gained using bio fertilizer was higher than that obtained using conventional inorganic fertilizer 16 tsagaraki et al 2007 in contrast to previous studies 19 20 reported that omww application has a negative impact on cultivated plants the impacts of fatty acids and phenolics found in omww may change the bioavailability of nutrients within living cells affecting plant development 21 according to ref 22 the most beneficial results from adding omww were observed when omww was treated in a repeated batch method the purpose of using omww to irrigate crop plants is to safely dispose of effluents that may be harmful to the environment and human health as well as to maximize fertilizer value the quality of irrigation water is critical for plant growth since it can change various physical soil properties such as tds ec temperature turbidity hardness and sedimentation as well as chemical properties such as alkalinity and acidity the primary goal of this comparative research was to assess the suitability and effects of reusing omww at different concentrations on the growth performance of green bean the fermented olive wastewater came from different manufacturers therefore it was not exclusive to one species production process green bean phaseolus vulgaris plants were chosen for this study because they are a fast growing plant that can be grown in the home since they are easy to nurture and provide a good crop for garden space required 2 materials and methods the soil used in this study was fine loamy mixed thermic and calcic paleargid calcareous soil with a low microbial activity collected from the surface 0 20 cm of the research station at al huson university college of al balqa applied university in northern jordan 32 27n 35 27e the soil was sieved using a 2 mm sieve after it had been air dried the soil was evaluated for main physicochemical parameters while particle size distribution was assessed using a hydrometer 23 soil electrical conductivity ec was measured on 1 1 soil water extracts the organic matter content was assessed using the walkley black technique and accessible phosphorus by sodium bicarbonate extraction it should be noted that this soil never really taken omww before experiments were conducted at the greenhouse of al huson university college omww was fermented with a liquid culture through each biologically active phenol degrading bacterium enterobacter asburiae and pseudomonas aeruginosa in comparison to unfermented omww which has a higher level of total nitrogen soluble nutrients nitrogen and potassium and lower cod bod and total phenolic content 24 eighteen pots were filled with dry soil in these pots 10 kg of dry soil was added along with five seeds of phaseolus vulgaris were planted at a depth of 5 7 cm in each pot as a source of irrigation water the settled omww with and without dilution with potable water was applied to the soil a greenhouse pot experiment used a randomized complete block design with three replications to examine the following treatments 1 100 omww pure omww 2 omww that has been diluted with 480 water 20 omww 4 omww v v 3 omww that has been diluted with 470 water 30 omww 6 omww v v 4 omww that has been diluted with 460 water 40 omww 8 omww v v 5 omww that has been diluted with 470 water 50 omww 10 omww v v the physiological and chemical analyses of irrigated water at various concentrations are shown in table 1 all pots were irrigated to saturation with tap water on the first day and then 1 l per pot was irrigated for two weeks until a vigorous shoot formed following the two week period each sub group was watered with its treatment finally once the plants had ceased growing measurements of dry weight of plant number of pods weight of pods and length of pods total chlorophyll chlorophyll a and b were taken the number of pods length of the pods fresh and dry weight were obtained at the end of experiment the plant was covered in aluminium foil and placed in an 80 c oven for 24 h weighing was done with a single pan electrical balance the pigment analyses chlorophyll a chlorophyll b and total chlorophyll were calculated after 15 days of germination in varied levels of effluent 25 chemical oxygen demand cod 5 day biochemical oxygen demand bod5 ph phenol ammonia phosphate and electrical conductivity were all determined in the collected samples ec all these analyses were carried out in accordance with the standard methods for the examination of water wand wastewater 1995 all treatments were repeated three times and the findings were statistically analysed as the averages of the three replicates 3 results and discussion the fermented omww included a high concentration of total suspended solids tss table 1 turbidity phenol phosphorus ec bod and cod were found to be the most abundant in 100 omww the effect of irrigation with different percentages of omww on the number of pods in common bean phaseolus vulgaris l was demonstrated in fig 1 in practice omww dilution occurred when water encountered omww that had previously been put to the soil for irrigation plants irrigated with varied percentages of omww significantly produced more pods per plant ranging from 2 3 to 12 7 more than the control p 0 05 with the highest results obtained when irrigated with 4 omww irrigation with different percentage of omww to bean plants phaseolus vulgaris l increased pod length significantly ranging from 5 to 23 more than the control p 0 05 with the highest results obtained when irrigated with 4 omww fig 2 the effect of irrigation with fermented omww had a significant effect on pod weight omww 4 and 6 scored the highest shoot fresh weight of pod 5 78 and 5 69 g respectively and the lowest 5 16 g under control treatment fig 3 irrigation with fermented omww showed a significant effect on plant dry weight fig 4 plant dry weight was the highest 9 26 g at omww 4 and the lowest 7 66 g at omww 0 control the increase percentage of plant dry weight was 20 9 9 7 3 3 2 59 respectively at 4 omww 6 omww 8 omww 10 omww compared with the plant dry weight 7 66 g at tap water figs 5 7 depicts the effect of fermented omww on photosynthetic properties fermented olive mill wastewater irrigation at 4 and 6 significantly increased chlorophyll a fig 5 with 4 and 6 fermented omww irrigation chlorophyll a was increased by about 31 and 15 respectively the response of chlorophyll b to fermented omww irrigation was opposite to the effects on chlorophyll a fig 6 the results of irrigation with fermented omww at different percentage showed a significant effect in total chlorophyll content in the early growth stages fig 7 significant differences p 0 05 indicated that irrigation with fermented omww 4 scored the highest total chlorophyll content 9 2 followed by 8 22 8 15 7 79 7 70 under water treatments of omww 6 omww 8 omww 10 and omww 0 respectively fig 8 shows the effect of irrigation with different percentage omww on phaseolus vulgaris growth performance with the highest results obtained when irrigated with 4 omww except for chlorophyll b irrigated with tap water and planted or growing in clay exclusively the percentage in fig 8 reflects the relative growth rise or reduction of certain plant characteristics when compared to other irrigated fluids and different growing types of soils the findings of this study correspond with those of 22 who found that when omww was treated in a repeated batch technique the seed biomass spike number and kernel weight rose in the treated plants 16 found that fresh omww may be transformed utilizing composting technology to boost soil fertility and plant productivity according to ref 3 plants irrigated with omww have higher biomass spike number plant growth and comparable or even higher dry production than plants watered with water according to ref 26 the catalytic treatment of olive oil mill wastewater with mno2 can result in a quality change that increases its ability as a soil modification while lowering environmental risk which has a significant impact on wheat grain yield by increasing the number of kernels per unit area spike density and kernel weight 27 observed that the use of table olive waste as irrigation water throughout the growing of four mediterranean plants tomato strawberry cucumber and pepper boosted growth of plants fruit size and total overall output by at least 20 against dipping and spraying powdery mildew illness was also decreased in strawberry plants according to ref 28 omww strengthened plants and increased their development and health indeed treated plants performed much better in the following areas i plant height 146 2 and 130 5 and ii average stem diameter according to ref 29 treated plants utilizing omww by various methods increased plant growth 30 discovered that smaller dosages of omww had a favorable impact on plant development while higher concentrations had a harmful effect in contrast to ref 20 the results reveal that the plants grown reduced after omww spreading due to a lower tillering index the plant did not yield new leaves but a greater number of secondary shoots which limited the leaf area index and the durum wheat grain yield reduced from the first to the last years in comparison to total dry matter yield moreover 21 discovered that the effects of fatty acids and phenolics in omww may alter the access of nutrients inside bio membranes influencing plant growth according to ref 31 when effluent concentrations increased so did chlorophyll content similarly chlorophyll content was higher than in contaminated soil the plant characteristics were substantially affected and can be explained by the fact that omww is a salt free liquid with fungicide properties which will improve plant number length etc as a result omww may be used as a fertilizer to increase plant strength and production as well as a fertilizer many scientists have established that this omww has a high fertilizer value when applied to the soil because olive mill effluent includes a high concentration of organic matter in a big volume of water it has the potential to be used as a fertilizer particularly for soils and crops omww holds significant levels of organic content 30 200 kg cod m 3 particularly aromatics which when combined with its high c n ratio and low ph impede biological breakdown operations omww boosted soil carbon content while maintaining a very low specific respiration the change on the other hand had a favorable effect on soil specific respiration fungi the most significant organisms degrading lignin and polyphenols were boosted by the omww as a result this fungal thrived on soil changed with omww where the ph and c n ratio were similarly favorable 32 the primary concept in omww reuse was that most of the mineral elements k p n produced from the soils during cultivation may be reused by employing treated olive wastewater as a natural nutrient soil amendments and a favorable irrigation supply of water 33 according to ref 34 antibacterial substances discovered in omww included tyrosol hydroxytyrosol oleuropeine 3 4 dihydroxyphenyl acetic acid and 4 hydroxybenzoic acid implementation on certain plants though may inhibit seedling growth and early plant development in a range of plants cavallaro et al 2014 and might even promote leaf and fruit abscission owing to plant sensitivity to the amount of omww supplied 20 the work will result in increasing volumes of higher quality olive oil and more efficient and cost effective oil production in dry nations like jordan every year omww will be used as a source of irrigation with varying amounts deemed supplementary irrigation to produce higher quality oil at a lesser cost researchers and farmers will need to collaborate to establish the ideal harvest period development of olive oil yield and quality of olive oil in order to further improve olive oil quality and production efficiency 4 conclusion the study found that irrigating agricultural land with a water mix containing a specified quantity of omww enhanced physicochemical parameters and influenced plant characteristics the plant characteristics were substantially affected when wastewater irrigated agricultural areas with water polluted with omww at concentrations no more than 4 except for chlorophyll b 4 omww irrigation yielded the greatest results in all pots with 2 8 more pods per plant 5 30 more pod length 3 11 more pod weight 2 5 21 more pod dry weight 4 1 31 more chlorophyll up to 8 more omww and 1 20 more total chlorophyll the

8736,as a novel family of 2d materials mxenes provide an extensive variety of applications in water and effluent treatment due to their distinctive properties and attractive applicability including superior electrical conductivity higher thermal stability hydrophilicity and high sorption reduction capacity their excellent sorption selectivity makes them perfect for removing hazardous contaminants currently mxene based materials are regarded as one of the most important topics in membrane separation processes this work presents a comprehensive review of recent developments in mxene based water treatment materials the applications of mxene based membranes adsorbents and photo catalysts in removing antibiotics and heavy metals from water are discussed a comparison of mxene based membranes with other 2d membranes is outlined finally prospects and challenges for future research are discussed graphical abstract image 1 keywords mxene 2d materials heavy metals antibiotics membranes wastewater treatment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the global demand and consumption of water have increased because of the growing population rapid urbanisation and industrialization concurrently anthropogenic activities caused high water pollution that in turn causes a significant risk to humans aquatic life and the ecosystem 1 2 different pollutants exist in various industrial effluents and may vary depending on the manufacturing company and other processing industries 3 mining steel iron production oil gas fracking industrial laundries powerhouse metal finishers and the food beverage industries are all responsible for the release of the enormous amount of contaminated wastewater numerous contaminants including toxins heavy metals oils pesticide residues sludge medical products as well as other industrial by products can be found in municipal and industrial water outlets 4 6 a large number of pharmaceutically active compounds phacs have been released into the environment without being properly treated over the past two decades 1 antibiotics are a very dangerous type of such compounds that cause contamination of the aqueous environment several antibiotics such as fluoroquinolones lincomycin sulfonamides and tetracyclines are widely used in livestock farming pharmaceutics and chicken metabolic products to cure and treat microbial infectious diseases 7 overuse of these pollutants and their untreated discharge cause environmental problems in a similar way other highly harmful elements such as toxic metal ions also have a tendency to bio accumulate and can slowly release into waterways posing significant risks to aquatic life mining recovery and other commercial operations that involve multiple toxic metal ions zn2 cd2 pb2 cr6 and cu2 are common sources of wastewater discharge that can eventually reach natural water bodies 8 11 rapid industrialization caused the mobilization of heavy metals into the environment which is a major concern due to their toxicity and therefore these lethal ions had a drastic effect on the ecosystems human health and other living organisms 12 thus eliminating such lethal pollutants from an aqueous environment is considered indispensable to preserving the ecosystem and human life literature reported the application of various treatment techniques in eliminating contaminants pollutants from wastewater such as adsorption 12 18 advanced oxidation 19 22 membrane separation 23 28 ozonation 29 30 ion exchange 31 chemical precipitation 32 electro dialysis 33 photo catalytic degradation 34 38 bio surfactants 39 electrocoagulation 40 and other physical chemical and biological treatment methods 29 41 44 most of these treatment techniques have certain drawbacks in treating wastewater including complex removal mechanisms disposal challenges excessive use of chemicals generation of sludge and by products high energy consumption insufficient removal of noxious compounds not being valuable at very low concentrations of contaminants formation of toxic by products and regeneration ability 45 in a similar way the photo catalysis processes which employed n type semiconductors tio2 are eco friendly with fascinating potential in removing stable organic contaminants because of the degradation and mineralization of the organic pollutants 46 however the employed semiconductors like tio2 often failed to be witnessed under visible light illumination this is ascribed to the high electron hole e h pair recombination rate and higher band gap 3 2 ev 47 other semiconductor materials like transition metal sulphides also had the disadvantage of photo corrosion which is the self oxidation of photo induced holes 48 such drawbacks can easily be avoided by developing a heterogeneous z type system comprised of a potent electron donor semiconductor 48 50 recently a number of nanocomposites have displayed remarkable potential in water purification owing to their incredible physicochemical features 51 55 membrane based wastewater treatment methods have found incredible consideration in recent times numerous 2d materials such as covalent organic frameworks cofs graphene oxide go 56 layered zeolites 57 58 metal organic frameworks mofs 59 and transition metal dichalcogenides tmds have been widely applied for membrane synthesis with superior separation performances 60 62 mxenes on the other hand are a new family of 2d nanomaterials discovered by drexel university researchers in 2011 63 64 mxenes are usually described by the formula mn 1xntx where m is an early transition metal like ti mo sc w v or zr x is carbon or nitrogen t represents the surface termination group like cl f o or oh x is the number of surface functional groups and n ranges from 1 to 4 65 67 typical mxene structures and compositions are illustrated in fig 1 68 these new class of materials mxenes are a good alternative to many applications because of their unique structural features such as ease of fabrication hydrophilicity considerable interlayer spacing dynamic electrochemistry activated metallic hydroxide sites high specific surface area higher conductivity biocompatibility incredible chemical stability ion exchange property maximum chemical stability robust surface functional groups and superior adsorption reduction capability 69 73 these materials have been at the forefront of studies for developing mxene based membranes and photo catalysts in removing degrading various contaminants and different pollutants from wastewater 69 74 76 this review focuses on the latest advances and novelties in mxene based membranes and materials adsorbents and photo catalysts for the removal of heavy metals and antibiotics from wastewater the effectiveness of various mxene based membranes at removing harmful pollutants is carefully assessed and the applications of mxenes as adsorbents and photo catalysts are described in considerable detail moreover a comparative analysis of the mxene membranes with other 2d materials is also provided lastly various intended challenges are highlighted and recommendations regarding future research are provided 2 removal of heavy metals and antibiotics by mxene based membranes 2 1 removal of heavy metals mxenes have been employed for the removal of various heavy meals from the aqueous phase such as copper cu2 chromium cr6 barium ba2 cadmium cd2 mercury hg2 and lead pb2 considering that heavy metal ions possess a size lower than 4 5 å they can be easily entrapped within the interlayer spacing lower than 2 å of mxene sheets apart from this the chemical functionalities of the mxene s surface are also responsible to display an enhanced adsorptive uptake mxene based membranes have emerged as novel membranes for the uptake of heavy metal ions from water 77 a summary of published literature on the applications of mxene based membranes for the removal of metal ions is presented in table 1 xie et al 2019 employed ti3c2tx based membranes by intercalating reduced graphene oxide between the layers 83 nanomaterials were successfully incorporated into the membrane by hydroxylation which led to increased wettability adsorption ability and metal ions reduction experimentally only 44 of the initial cr vi was removed after 150 min over the pristine ti3c2tx membrane which was mainly ascribed to its dense configuration that restricted the mass transfer of hcro4 while the performance of hcro4 removal of the composite membrane resulted as high as 91 after 150 min interestingly the authors reported that after hcro4 removal a shift of 0 1 0 2 ev to greater binding energy was noted for the c tiδ tx moieties suggesting that electrons are being drained from ti3c2tx as it reductively removes hcro4 in consequence it was also considered that hcro4 elimination over ti3c2tx follows an independent pathway of electron transfer from ti3c2tx to hcro4 releasing cr iii that can be attached in ti3c2tx based membranes 83 a recent study reported an improved be ii removal from be nh2 2 complexing solutions using a sandwiched ti3c2tx mxene nano zero valent iron nzvi fungal hypha fh nanofiber hybrid membrane 84 fig 2 a graphically illustrates the schematic for the self assembly nanofiber preparation 84 there were numerous mxene nzvi catalytic units coated on the surface of the final nanofiber membranes in high magnification nzvi appeared to be uniformly dispersed within the mxene nanosheet layer when dealing with water permeability such nanofibers exhibited about 301 times greater permeability compared to bare ti3c2tx membrane while capturing up to 99 8 be2 from the be nh2 2 solution with low concentration 19 85 ppm in particular the best be2 adsorption capacity of the membrane was estimated to be as high as 95 20 mg g 1 at ph 5 0 and 35 c based on the complete characterization of the studied membranes be2 forms beo and beo2 bidentate inner sphere complexes on mxene nanosheets and this contributes to efficient be2 removal due to its sandwiched structure mxene nzvi fh was easily activated and reused after leaching with 0 1 m hcl solution the economic and environmental implications of this aspect are significant fig 2b shows the schematic of the synthesis of ti3c2tx mxene mof pvdf nanocomposite membranes 81 the prepared membranes exhibited excellent removal for selected heavy metals with a rejection rate higher than 95 2 0 5 for each ion notably high for mn2 97 6 0 4 as depicted in fig 2c and d 81 using polyethylenimine pei polymer crosslinked with dopamine and graphene oxide on the top surface of the membranes zhao et al 2021 observed a decrease in the water inlet pores 85 consequently the resulting go mxene pei membranes displayed less permeance of water in contrast the water permeability of go mxene pei membranes increased with decreasing load for instance when the membranes load was 166 mg m 2 the membrane permeability was approximately 1 3 0 1 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 water permeability increased by about 3 times with a reduced membrane load of 100 mg m 2 while rejection for ca2 and mg2 increased slightly but still was over 70 85 86 due to the weakened adsorption associated with the reduction of negative charge during thermal self crosslinking of mxene membranes wang et al 2021 reported the regeneration of the surface charge via hydroxylation 82 in this process the alkali solution of koh is used to replace f with oh surprisingly the rejection efficiency of a 383 nm thick hydroxylated mxene membrane was higher compared to a pristine mxene membrane when two selective membranes were used to remove cd2 cu2 and pb2 co existing anions cl and or no3 under external voltage up to 70 min of tests the authors concluded that when the interlayer spacing is controlled through a thermal self linking protocol good operational durability and reproducibility are possible 82 actually the control of the d spacing is an important matter in terms of water treatment applications in fact the nanostructure of mxene particularly the d spacing should be further studied as the permeation of water molecules can cause channel enlargement in 2d materials that in turn caused influenced the rejection efficiency 87 it was recently demonstrated that d spacing affects the ion selectivity of mxene membranes 88 fan et al 2020 reported the synthesis of mxene pvdf membrane and evaluated its potential in the separation and removal of k pb2 ions by exerting external voltage as depicted in fig 3 89 the addition of mxenes enhanced the lead ions rejection in addition to improving the anti swelling potential of the resultant membranes the membrane reusability by using hcl has been also proved by yang et al 2020 who reported ions removal of 63 64 and 70 for cu2 cd2 and cr6 respectively from wastewater using fe3o4 mxene composite nanofiltration membrane 8 2 2 removal of antibiotics by mxene based membranes in recent years the release of antibiotics in groundwater from various effluent and clinical waste from hospitals and pharmacies has become a growing environmental concern thus severely affecting biodiversity and other public health services 90 91 these toxic compounds are very harmful to the ecosystem even at trace concentrations causing the emergence of terrible viruses and bacteria with exceptionally high resistance to existing antibiotics 92 aquatic organisms are particularly vulnerable to some antibiotics 93 therefore efficient and enhanced removal of antibiotics from an aqueous environment is a necessary step in adopting a sustainable environment nanofiltration with polymeric membranes is emerged as a potential technology owing to its high performance and continuous and easy operation 94 96 membrane fouling by the adsorption of the antibiotic is the main drawback which decreases water permeability and membrane stability the primary reason for membrane fouling is the electrostatic attraction between the membrane surface and the target antibiotic molecules 97 furthermore the uneven pores configuration in polymeric nanofiltration membranes makes it necessary to affect the water solvent permeation to achieve enough antibiotics rejection 95 these deficiencies may be overcome by improving the anti fouling resistance and regular pore structure of the employed membranes the 2d laminated membranes exhibited better permeance and pollutants rejection via ion sieving and are good in pervaporation filtration 98 99 the trade off between the permeance and the selectivity in polymeric membranes can be overcome by using the ti3c2tx nanosheets with regular slit shaped interlayer distances which also boosted the selective permeability of the employed membranes 100 101 table 2 enlists various mxene based membranes and their successful application in the removal of a range of antibiotics such as azithromycin bacitracin tetracycline erythromycin penicillin rifampicin and chloramphenicol both water and alcohol soluble the studied membranes showed effective filtration and exceptional rejection performance due to their regular spacings equidistant nanolayers and large aspect ratio titanium carbide based membranes have a greater solvent permeance compared to polymeric nanofiltration membranes because these have a high aspect ratio which results in a regular two dimensional 2d structure and high permeation flux besides the increased antifouling is also caused by the interaction between the surface terminations of the employed membranes and the target antibiotics that affect the final rejection performance of the employed membranes fig 4 a provides the comparative approach between the permeability of the ti3c2tx membranes at different membrane thicknesses against the separation of tetracycline aqueous solutions 102 generally membranes with greater thickness offer enhanced rejection performance compared to lower thicknesses because of the fewer defects 103 fig 4b and c shows exceptional separation performance of the ti3c2tx membranes 2 4 μm titanium carbide nanosheets against different antibiotics penicillin tetracycline azithromycin erythromycin bacitracin chloramphenicol and rifampicin in both aqueous and ethanolic solutions 102 the reported water permeance of the smallest penicillin molecule with a size of 1 4 nm 0 7 nm was about 223 1 9 5 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 with 89 5 0 5 rejection the reported water permeability values for tetracycline erythromycin azithromycin and bacitracin aqueous solutions via a 500 nm thick ti3c2tx membrane were 250 4 5 2 278 5 10 5 280 4 15 2 and 340 5 20 5 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 respectively in a similar way the rejection rates of these antibiotics in an aqueous environment are reported to be about 91 5 0 4 95 1 2 95 1 1 6 and 99 5 0 4 respectively furthermore the ti3c2tx membrane exhibits superior separation performance of the molecular sieving for the ethanol soluble antibiotics rifampicin and chloramphenicol the permeability of ethanol is specifically reported to be about 200 5 10 2 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 with an 89 5 0 3 chloramphenicol rejection 1 7 nm 1 0 nm similarly the same membrane revealed 96 2 1 8 and 300 5 10 2 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 of ethanol rejection and permeance for the larger rifampicin molecules 102 fig 4d shows the stability of the ti3c2t x membranes and their time dependent separation performance with tetracycline aqueous solution and rifampicin ethanol solution 102 besides the selectivity of the membrane could also be enhanced by carefully controlling the interlayer spacing 104 fig 5 illustrates the removal mechanism of tetracycline hydrochloride tc from wastewater by the g c3n4 mxene pes cn mx composite membrane which exhibited high permeance of 1790 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 compared to pristine mxene membrane 105 the rejection efficiency of 86 for tc antibiotic was reported by the employed membrane literature also reported the superior anti swelling characteristics of the mxene carboxylated cellulose nanofibers ti3c2tx cnfs based membranes in a water environment for up to 76 h 106 the employed membrane unveiled better separation performance with high pure water permeability of 26 0 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 and high selectivity rejection of antibiotics 99 0 for azithromycin 106 3 mxene based materials in other water treatment applications 3 1 mxenes as adsorbents for the removal of antibiotics and heavy metals the presence of toxic heavy metal ions even in trace amounts has a drastic influence on living organisms and the environment therefore the elimination of these lethal pollutants from the aqueous phase is an essential step in treating toxic effluents mxenes are an ideal candidate to be employed as adsorbents material for the enhanced uptake of various heavy metal ions from an aqueous environment since they exhibit unique physicochemical and structural characteristics such as numerous surface terminations large specific surface area hydrophilicity and electron richness 107 these adsorbents unveiled exceptional adsorption potentials for the successful elimination of heavy metal ions from an aqueous environment 94 96 numerous available functional groups and active sites for adsorption on the surfaces of the employed nanomaterials also contribute to the enhanced removal of toxic heavy metals 111 similar to the elimination of the heavy metals the mxene adsorbents have also revealed outstanding uptake performance for the confiscation of potentially toxic antibiotics from the water environment mxenes hold numerous active surface functional groups whose activity can be significantly increased under the action of the magnetic field and it is more evident with acidic functional groups 15 literature explained the development of the sodium alginate mxene cofe2o4 sa mx cfo composite material for the successful adsorption of cu2 and ciprofloxacin cip with an external magnetic field 15 the adsorption potential was reported to enhance by 3 53 and 24 19 against the selective removal of cu2 and cip when the employed adsorbent is subjected to the rotating magnetic field rmf the enhancement in adsorption potential with the help of rmf is ascribed to the following reasons i rmf could enhance the h bonding of the adsorbent surface that caused an exceptional rise in cip uptake ii the energy of the magnetic field is adsorbed by the target contaminants thus enhancing their kinetic energy and mass transfer capability and iii the cfo exhibit greater strength of the magnetic field at the micro interface compared to fe3o4 causing higher influence of the magnetic field for both pollutants and solutions 15 fig 6 illustrates the mechanism of barium ions uptake by the surface of the mxene layers in which both the physisorption and chemisorption are responsible for the ba adsorption 112 the mxene surface is generally terminated by the o oh and f functional groups after the etching process therefore these existing functional groups act as vacant active adsorption sites for ba ions to be adsorbed onto the adsorbent surface the adsorption of ba ions by the mxene s surface functional groups occurs by the following reactions to form ba oh 2 and ba f 2 ba2 2oh ba oh 2 ba2 2f ba f 2 such developed barium hydroxides and barium fluorides are the key ba constituent in an aqueous environment and they are chemisorbed onto the mxene surface literature also reported the removal of a range of pharmaceutical compounds amitriptyline amt verapamil carbamazepine 17 α ethinyl estradiol ibuprofen and diclofenac by the sonicated ti3c2tx mxene 113 the highest selective adsorption was reported for the amt with an adsorption capacity of 58 7 mg g 1 which is due to the electrostatic attraction between the positive amt molecules and the negative mxene surface the enhanced adsorption of the sonicated mxene compared to pristine mxene material is due to the creation of larger cavitation bubbles at lower frequencies that formed oxygenated functional groups on the mxene surface and also make well dispersed mxene another study reported the adsorption of cip by the alkaline intercalated mxene sodium ions si ti3c2tx and observed better adsorption performance compared to pristine mxene due to its high specific surface area and the broad layers layered spacing and vacant sites in which the pollutant molecules might be able to adsorb easily 114 besides the intercalation also caused more o and oh surface terminations to develop on the adsorbent surface which acts as active sites for cip adsorption in addition the adsorbent efficiency was also reported to marginally improved in succeeding regeneration stages 99 7 because of the nanosheets crystallinity loss enhancing amorphosity that in turn caused increased porosity and moieties hence resulting in the development of numerous active sites increasing specific surface area 114 table 3 and table 4 enlist various mxene based adsorbents and their successful applications in the removal of different heavy metal ions and antibiotics from an aqueous environment mxene based adsorbents unveiled enhanced adsorption potential against the elimination of antibiotics and toxic heavy metals in water treatment technologies these studies proposed the efficient employment of mxene based adsorbents in removing lethal contaminants and pollutants from an aqueous environment 3 2 mxenes as photo catalysts for degradation of antibiotics photo catalysis is regarded as one of the cost effective methods for the removal of various environmental contaminants 75 125 126 mxenes so far have been employed in various photo catalytic applications such as n2 fixation 126 128 co2 reduction 129 132 degradation of several pollutants 127 133 135 and water splitting 136 139 mxene could also improve the photo catalytic activity of the as developed composite in these applications by performing numerous functions including limiting the size of the photo catalyst enhancing reactant adsorption acting as robust support and promoting photo generated charge carrier separation 140 the successful use of mxenes in photo catalysis can be attributed primarily to the following factors i developing intimate contact interfaces between the mxene and other semiconductor materials and is facilitated by numerous available functional groups ii changing the surface chemistry caused by changing the bandgap alignment of the mxene and iii mxene has outstanding metallic conductivity and electron acceptance due to the conductive metallic core in its layered structure 141 in particular mxenes can be made hybridized with other substances like polymers graphene mofs etc to enhance their photo catalytic characteristics mxenes with distinct lamellar structures and high conductivity have been employed as co catalysts to enhance the photo catalytic degradation capabilities of composites 142 table 5 enlists various mxene based catalysts for the successful photo catalytic degradation of antibiotics the mxene based photo catalysts are also employed in literature for efficient environmental photo catalysis like the removal of a range of antibiotics and pharmaceuticals from an aqueous environment because of their fascinating characteristics such as adjustable band gap 0 92 1 75 ev appreciable safety hydrophilicity high strength and structural stability large surface area non toxicity high conductivity environmental flexibility and huge interlayer spacing 143 145 mxenes are distinguished by their lamellar nanostructures with high conductivity and these materials have the potential to improve the photo catalytic potential of their composites when employed as co catalysts 146 147 generally antibiotics in very low concentration have been perceived globally in a land environment and natural water and are used by humans and other industries such as aquaculture cattle and poultry thus can easily contaminate the environment 123 148 these could enter the environment via different pathways such as domestic wastewater industrial effluents and other waste streams and livestock wastewater 149 their continuous disposal eventually leads to their gradual accumulation in an aquatic environment and the soil from where they can also pass into the food chain mxenes have unveiled remarkable potential as co catalysts for the photo catalytic degradation of numerous pharmaceuticals because of their exceptional characteristics such as adjustable bandgap activated metallic hydroxide sites availability of numerous surface functional groups biocompatibility hydrophilicity high specific surface area high metallic conductivity ease of functionalization and fast photo generated charge carrier separation ability 75 140 a recent study assessed the confiscation of enrofloxacin antibiotic compounds from water by the use of newly developed multi functional adsorbent photo catalyst mxene tio2 composites by hydrothermal treatment 123 in addition to this the layered mxene structure can also enhance the photo catalytic activity by promoting the photo generated charge carrier separation limiting the size of photo catalysts enhancing reacting adsorption and acting as a robust support 140 the mxenes materials exhibited exceptional potential in the photo catalytic degradation of various antibiotics and pharmaceutical compounds mxenes can be also used as a host material to enhance the catalytic performance of different co catalysts numerous methods have been employed for the development of mxene based photo catalysts for successful degradation of pharmaceuticals such as anodization chemical vapor deposition in situ growth method sol hydrothermal method evaporation induced self assembly method in situ reductive deposition method 75 in the case of nh2 mil 125 ti tio2 ti3c2 for the efficient degradation of tc hcl the better photo catalytic performance of the hetero junction is ascribed to the enhanced characteristics after the ti3c2 incorporation which improved the charge transfer 150 the pharmaceutical tc hcl degradation includes the oh formation by water oxidation and electrons activation from the valence band vb to the conduction band cb for the employed nh2 mil 125 ti similarly the electron migration from the nh2 mil 125 ti cb to the tio2 cb and then from tio2 to ti3c2 transpires through the hetero junction the formation of the schottky junction performs as an electron trap to catch the photo induced electrons that are transferred to the ti3c2 surface for electron oxygen reduction in the case of the photo catalytic degradation of carbamazepine by the hetero structural tio2 ti3c2tx mxene the generated electrons at the surface of the tio2 are prohibited from being shifted to ti3c2tx sheets at the interface fig 7 a 151 such barred transferring is ascribed to the following reasons i mxene s work function is much lower compared to tio2 and ii mxene has a higher negative fermi level compared to the tio2 cb 151 another study reported the use of a novel cufe2o4 mxene cfo ti3c2 hetero junction photo catalyst that unveiled substantial synergic visible light degradation of sulfamethazine smz which is ascribed to the enhanced lifetime of carriers and photo electrons transfer in the employed composite 141 fig 7b illustrates the mechanism of the photocatalytic degradation of the smz by the employed cfo ti3c2 photo catalyst under visible light the cufe2o4 cfo with a band gap of 1 43 ev is excited by the visible light and the photo generated electrons are excited from the vb to cb in the case of cfo ti3c2 the photo induced electrons are shifted to the 2d ti3c2 from the cfo while numerous electrons appear near the fermi level in the ti3c2 flakes making it somehow metallic in nature trapping location for light induced electrons 141 moreover ti3c2 can also provide numerous active adsorption sites due to its large specific surface area besides the antibiotic molecules smz could also be adsorbed by the active material throughout the photo catalysis process fig 8 shows the smz degradation into the low molecular weight organic compounds aminobenzenes and methylpyrimidines 151 these studies reflect the importance of mxene based photo catalysts for the successful photo catalytic degradation of numerous antibiotics and pharmaceuticals in the next generation photo catalysis 4 comparison of mxene based membranes with other 2d materials mxenes are a new class of 2d materials along with 2d zeolites mofs cofs graphitic carbon nitride g c3n4 graphene graphene oxide go and layered tmdcs 60 159 162 there is a promising future for molecular separation applications using most of these 2d materials 163 164 two broad categories of 2d material based membranes are spongy nanosheet membranes and laminar membranes fig 9 159 additionally 2d materials can be employed as a filler to offset the characteristics of the polymeric membranes as shown in fig 10 a 165 the separation efficiency of 2d membranes depends on their physicochemical properties and molecular transport pathway the transport pathways of 2d materials can be manipulated to achieve a precise molecular separation nanochannels can form horizontal or vertical pathways in laminar membranes fig 10b and c 165 the frequently employed assembly for the non porous nanosheets such as mxenes and go are the laminar membranes although laminar membrane structure is expected to have less permeation rates compared to porous membranes such as porous graphene mofs and zeolite nanosheets however their facile synthesis methods still make them potential candidates for large scale applications 159 although a direct comparison of mxenes with other 2d materials is impractical because the performance of membranes can better be judged under similar conditions however this section aims to overview the efficiency of numerous 2d materials for the separation of specific pollutants including antibiotics and heavy metals a comparative analysis of mxene based membranes with membranes prepared from other 2d materials for the removal of selected pollutants is presented in table 6 the efficiency of mxene based membranes is comparable to or better than most of the 2d membranes offering in special cases separation efficiency as high as 99 and compelling productivities in terms of permeate flux this demonstrates the significance of using these membranes for water purification in the near future 5 conclusions challenges and future perspective this review covers a research gap dealing with the elucidation of the latest advances in mxenes membranes and materials adsorbents and photo catalysts for selective separations in water treatments including the removal of heavy metals and antibiotics these pollutants represent a serious environmental concern since they affect the quality of water bodies thus severely affecting living organisms here it has been proved the outperforming separation of mxenes membranes and materials for the removal of such toxic compounds moreover mxene based composites have drawn lots of interest as photo catalysts to degrade contaminants because of their outstanding thermal and optica characteristics hydrophilicity significant surface area configurable chemical characteristics high chemical stability regular planar configurations high metallic conductivity and so many derivative products it was found that literature reported numerous mxene based membranes with fascinating separation performance compared to other available 2d materials mxene based membranes have shown remarkable potential in water treatment but still there exist many challenges that need careful attention because these hurdles prevent them from their actual applications in the real water environment some of the key challenges and recommendations are summarized below the hf synthesis methods for the mass production of mxenes should be minimized because of their drastic ecological concerns and therefore other innovative and sustainable alternative green synthesis techniques should be adopted mxenes are currently produced on lab scale costly processes but with lower yields therefore mxene synthesis via commercial routes should be at the forefront of present day researchers to develop cheap efficient and environmentally friendly mxenes the application of mxene based membranes in the actual environment real water system should be explored since it is almost missing in the literature therefore these membranes should be at the forefront of future studies in order to challenge their efficacy in the actual water environment the mechanisms of pollutants from wastewater should be explored in much detail and an in depth analysis should be carried out by using different available characterization tools and theoretical models a particular focus should be placed on the regeneration of the membranes employed and the successful removal of pollutants retained on their surfaces this would achieve long term membrane stability by keeping its cost much lower and the membrane much more beneficial one of the key challenges is the storage and stability of mxene because of its oxidizing nature in the water environment therefore the future research area should cope with this trial by exploring different pathways for its mitigations this will help in developing the mxene s stability and its wide range of applications various theoretical and experimental methods should be adopted for optimum water fluxes through the studied membranes since these can be directly controlled by the flake sizes of the employed mxenes the stability of mxene nanosheets is a critical parameter in assessing its potential since it directly affects the overall lifespan of these materials therefore future research in this direction might lead to more stable mxene structures that in turn would be employed in treating a wide range of hazardous pollutants from actual wastewater streams the applications of mxene based membranes in removing simultaneous pollutants from an aqueous environment should be explored because real wastewater streams are comprised of different kinds of contaminants and pollutants the elimination of various pollutants by photo catalysis via the employment of mxenes should also be explored because extra efforts are needed to develop well connected interfaces to enhance photon adsorption and charge carrier transportation 173 this in turn would cause superior redox capability and enhanced interfacial arrangements which could develop efficient photocatalysts with robust degradation abilities various theoretical calculations such as the density functional theory and first principles methods should be explored and introduced into the design of the mxene based photo catalysts in order to envisage the future structural performance and understand the photo catalytic mechanism at the micro level and the overall photo catalytic process 145 critical and widespread research is needed in the development and applications of mxene based membranes for identifying crosslinkers and substrates for the membrane influencing its performance 174 author contribution statement faj conceptualization writing original draft preparation rcm reviewing methodology ii visualization

membranes wastewater treatment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the global demand and consumption of water have increased because of the growing population rapid urbanisation and industrialization concurrently anthropogenic activities caused high water pollution that in turn causes a significant risk to humans aquatic life and the ecosystem 1 2 different pollutants exist in various industrial effluents and may vary depending on the manufacturing company and other processing industries 3 mining steel iron production oil gas fracking industrial laundries powerhouse metal finishers and the food beverage industries are all responsible for the release of the enormous amount of contaminated wastewater numerous contaminants including toxins heavy metals oils pesticide residues sludge medical products as well as other industrial by products can be found in municipal and industrial water outlets 4 6 a large number of pharmaceutically active compounds phacs have been released into the environment without being properly treated over the past two decades 1 antibiotics are a very dangerous type of such compounds that cause contamination of the aqueous environment several antibiotics such as fluoroquinolones lincomycin sulfonamides and tetracyclines are widely used in livestock farming pharmaceutics and chicken metabolic products to cure and treat microbial infectious diseases 7 overuse of these pollutants and their untreated discharge cause environmental problems in a similar way other highly harmful elements such as toxic metal ions also have a tendency to bio accumulate and can slowly release into waterways posing significant risks to aquatic life mining recovery and other commercial operations that involve multiple toxic metal ions zn2 cd2 pb2 cr6 and cu2 are common sources of wastewater discharge that can eventually reach natural water bodies 8 11 rapid industrialization caused the mobilization of heavy metals into the environment which is a major concern due to their toxicity and therefore these lethal ions had a drastic effect on the ecosystems human health and other living organisms 12 thus eliminating such lethal pollutants from an aqueous environment is considered indispensable to preserving the ecosystem and human life literature reported the application of various treatment techniques in eliminating contaminants pollutants from wastewater such as adsorption 12 18 advanced oxidation 19 22 membrane separation 23 28 ozonation 29 30 ion exchange 31 chemical precipitation 32 electro dialysis 33 photo catalytic degradation 34 38 bio surfactants 39 electrocoagulation 40 and other physical chemical and biological treatment methods 29 41 44 most of these treatment techniques have certain drawbacks in treating wastewater including complex removal mechanisms disposal challenges excessive use of chemicals generation of sludge and by products high energy consumption insufficient removal of noxious compounds not being valuable at very low concentrations of contaminants formation of toxic by products and regeneration ability 45 in a similar way the photo catalysis processes which employed n type semiconductors tio2 are eco friendly with fascinating potential in removing stable organic contaminants because of the degradation and mineralization of the organic pollutants 46 however the employed semiconductors like tio2 often failed to be witnessed under visible light illumination this is ascribed to the high electron hole e h pair recombination rate and higher band gap 3 2 ev 47 other semiconductor materials like transition metal sulphides also had the disadvantage of photo corrosion which is the self oxidation of photo induced holes 48 such drawbacks can easily be avoided by developing a heterogeneous z type system comprised of a potent electron donor semiconductor 48 50 recently a number of nanocomposites have displayed remarkable potential in water purification owing to their incredible physicochemical features 51 55 membrane based wastewater treatment methods have found incredible consideration in recent times numerous 2d materials such as covalent organic frameworks cofs graphene oxide go 56 layered zeolites 57 58 metal organic frameworks mofs 59 and transition metal dichalcogenides tmds have been widely applied for membrane synthesis with superior separation performances 60 62 mxenes on the other hand are a new family of 2d nanomaterials discovered by drexel university researchers in 2011 63 64 mxenes are usually described by the formula mn 1xntx where m is an early transition metal like ti mo sc w v or zr x is carbon or nitrogen t represents the surface termination group like cl f o or oh x is the number of surface functional groups and n ranges from 1 to 4 65 67 typical mxene structures and compositions are illustrated in fig 1 68 these new class of materials mxenes are a good alternative to many applications because of their unique structural features such as ease of fabrication hydrophilicity considerable interlayer spacing dynamic electrochemistry activated metallic hydroxide sites high specific surface area higher conductivity biocompatibility incredible chemical stability ion exchange property maximum chemical stability robust surface functional groups and superior adsorption reduction capability 69 73 these materials have been at the forefront of studies for developing mxene based membranes and photo catalysts in removing degrading various contaminants and different pollutants from wastewater 69 74 76 this review focuses on the latest advances and novelties in mxene based membranes and materials adsorbents and photo catalysts for the removal of heavy metals and antibiotics from wastewater the effectiveness of various mxene based membranes at removing harmful pollutants is carefully assessed and the applications of mxenes as adsorbents and photo catalysts are described in considerable detail moreover a comparative analysis of the mxene membranes with other 2d materials is also provided lastly various intended challenges are highlighted and recommendations regarding future research are provided 2 removal of heavy metals and antibiotics by mxene based membranes 2 1 removal of heavy metals mxenes have been employed for the removal of various heavy meals from the aqueous phase such as copper cu2 chromium cr6 barium ba2 cadmium cd2 mercury hg2 and lead pb2 considering that heavy metal ions possess a size lower than 4 5 å they can be easily entrapped within the interlayer spacing lower than 2 å of mxene sheets apart from this the chemical functionalities of the mxene s surface are also responsible to display an enhanced adsorptive uptake mxene based membranes have emerged as novel membranes for the uptake of heavy metal ions from water 77 a summary of published literature on the applications of mxene based membranes for the removal of metal ions is presented in table 1 xie et al 2019 employed ti3c2tx based membranes by intercalating reduced graphene oxide between the layers 83 nanomaterials were successfully incorporated into the membrane by hydroxylation which led to increased wettability adsorption ability and metal ions reduction experimentally only 44 of the initial cr vi was removed after 150 min over the pristine ti3c2tx membrane which was mainly ascribed to its dense configuration that restricted the mass transfer of hcro4 while the performance of hcro4 removal of the composite membrane resulted as high as 91 after 150 min interestingly the authors reported that after hcro4 removal a shift of 0 1 0 2 ev to greater binding energy was noted for the c tiδ tx moieties suggesting that electrons are being drained from ti3c2tx as it reductively removes hcro4 in consequence it was also considered that hcro4 elimination over ti3c2tx follows an independent pathway of electron transfer from ti3c2tx to hcro4 releasing cr iii that can be attached in ti3c2tx based membranes 83 a recent study reported an improved be ii removal from be nh2 2 complexing solutions using a sandwiched ti3c2tx mxene nano zero valent iron nzvi fungal hypha fh nanofiber hybrid membrane 84 fig 2 a graphically illustrates the schematic for the self assembly nanofiber preparation 84 there were numerous mxene nzvi catalytic units coated on the surface of the final nanofiber membranes in high magnification nzvi appeared to be uniformly dispersed within the mxene nanosheet layer when dealing with water permeability such nanofibers exhibited about 301 times greater permeability compared to bare ti3c2tx membrane while capturing up to 99 8 be2 from the be nh2 2 solution with low concentration 19 85 ppm in particular the best be2 adsorption capacity of the membrane was estimated to be as high as 95 20 mg g 1 at ph 5 0 and 35 c based on the complete characterization of the studied membranes be2 forms beo and beo2 bidentate inner sphere complexes on mxene nanosheets and this contributes to efficient be2 removal due to its sandwiched structure mxene nzvi fh was easily activated and reused after leaching with 0 1 m hcl solution the economic and environmental implications of this aspect are significant fig 2b shows the schematic of the synthesis of ti3c2tx mxene mof pvdf nanocomposite membranes 81 the prepared membranes exhibited excellent removal for selected heavy metals with a rejection rate higher than 95 2 0 5 for each ion notably high for mn2 97 6 0 4 as depicted in fig 2c and d 81 using polyethylenimine pei polymer crosslinked with dopamine and graphene oxide on the top surface of the membranes zhao et al 2021 observed a decrease in the water inlet pores 85 consequently the resulting go mxene pei membranes displayed less permeance of water in contrast the water permeability of go mxene pei membranes increased with decreasing load for instance when the membranes load was 166 mg m 2 the membrane permeability was approximately 1 3 0 1 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 water permeability increased by about 3 times with a reduced membrane load of 100 mg m 2 while rejection for ca2 and mg2 increased slightly but still was over 70 85 86 due to the weakened adsorption associated with the reduction of negative charge during thermal self crosslinking of mxene membranes wang et al 2021 reported the regeneration of the surface charge via hydroxylation 82 in this process the alkali solution of koh is used to replace f with oh surprisingly the rejection efficiency of a 383 nm thick hydroxylated mxene membrane was higher compared to a pristine mxene membrane when two selective membranes were used to remove cd2 cu2 and pb2 co existing anions cl and or no3 under external voltage up to 70 min of tests the authors concluded that when the interlayer spacing is controlled through a thermal self linking protocol good operational durability and reproducibility are possible 82 actually the control of the d spacing is an important matter in terms of water treatment applications in fact the nanostructure of mxene particularly the d spacing should be further studied as the permeation of water molecules can cause channel enlargement in 2d materials that in turn caused influenced the rejection efficiency 87 it was recently demonstrated that d spacing affects the ion selectivity of mxene membranes 88 fan et al 2020 reported the synthesis of mxene pvdf membrane and evaluated its potential in the separation and removal of k pb2 ions by exerting external voltage as depicted in fig 3 89 the addition of mxenes enhanced the lead ions rejection in addition to improving the anti swelling potential of the resultant membranes the membrane reusability by using hcl has been also proved by yang et al 2020 who reported ions removal of 63 64 and 70 for cu2 cd2 and cr6 respectively from wastewater using fe3o4 mxene composite nanofiltration membrane 8 2 2 removal of antibiotics by mxene based membranes in recent years the release of antibiotics in groundwater from various effluent and clinical waste from hospitals and pharmacies has become a growing environmental concern thus severely affecting biodiversity and other public health services 90 91 these toxic compounds are very harmful to the ecosystem even at trace concentrations causing the emergence of terrible viruses and bacteria with exceptionally high resistance to existing antibiotics 92 aquatic organisms are particularly vulnerable to some antibiotics 93 therefore efficient and enhanced removal of antibiotics from an aqueous environment is a necessary step in adopting a sustainable environment nanofiltration with polymeric membranes is emerged as a potential technology owing to its high performance and continuous and easy operation 94 96 membrane fouling by the adsorption of the antibiotic is the main drawback which decreases water permeability and membrane stability the primary reason for membrane fouling is the electrostatic attraction between the membrane surface and the target antibiotic molecules 97 furthermore the uneven pores configuration in polymeric nanofiltration membranes makes it necessary to affect the water solvent permeation to achieve enough antibiotics rejection 95 these deficiencies may be overcome by improving the anti fouling resistance and regular pore structure of the employed membranes the 2d laminated membranes exhibited better permeance and pollutants rejection via ion sieving and are good in pervaporation filtration 98 99 the trade off between the permeance and the selectivity in polymeric membranes can be overcome by using the ti3c2tx nanosheets with regular slit shaped interlayer distances which also boosted the selective permeability of the employed membranes 100 101 table 2 enlists various mxene based membranes and their successful application in the removal of a range of antibiotics such as azithromycin bacitracin tetracycline erythromycin penicillin rifampicin and chloramphenicol both water and alcohol soluble the studied membranes showed effective filtration and exceptional rejection performance due to their regular spacings equidistant nanolayers and large aspect ratio titanium carbide based membranes have a greater solvent permeance compared to polymeric nanofiltration membranes because these have a high aspect ratio which results in a regular two dimensional 2d structure and high permeation flux besides the increased antifouling is also caused by the interaction between the surface terminations of the employed membranes and the target antibiotics that affect the final rejection performance of the employed membranes fig 4 a provides the comparative approach between the permeability of the ti3c2tx membranes at different membrane thicknesses against the separation of tetracycline aqueous solutions 102 generally membranes with greater thickness offer enhanced rejection performance compared to lower thicknesses because of the fewer defects 103 fig 4b and c shows exceptional separation performance of the ti3c2tx membranes 2 4 μm titanium carbide nanosheets against different antibiotics penicillin tetracycline azithromycin erythromycin bacitracin chloramphenicol and rifampicin in both aqueous and ethanolic solutions 102 the reported water permeance of the smallest penicillin molecule with a size of 1 4 nm 0 7 nm was about 223 1 9 5 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 with 89 5 0 5 rejection the reported water permeability values for tetracycline erythromycin azithromycin and bacitracin aqueous solutions via a 500 nm thick ti3c2tx membrane were 250 4 5 2 278 5 10 5 280 4 15 2 and 340 5 20 5 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 respectively in a similar way the rejection rates of these antibiotics in an aqueous environment are reported to be about 91 5 0 4 95 1 2 95 1 1 6 and 99 5 0 4 respectively furthermore the ti3c2tx membrane exhibits superior separation performance of the molecular sieving for the ethanol soluble antibiotics rifampicin and chloramphenicol the permeability of ethanol is specifically reported to be about 200 5 10 2 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 with an 89 5 0 3 chloramphenicol rejection 1 7 nm 1 0 nm similarly the same membrane revealed 96 2 1 8 and 300 5 10 2 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 of ethanol rejection and permeance for the larger rifampicin molecules 102 fig 4d shows the stability of the ti3c2t x membranes and their time dependent separation performance with tetracycline aqueous solution and rifampicin ethanol solution 102 besides the selectivity of the membrane could also be enhanced by carefully controlling the interlayer spacing 104 fig 5 illustrates the removal mechanism of tetracycline hydrochloride tc from wastewater by the g c3n4 mxene pes cn mx composite membrane which exhibited high permeance of 1790 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 compared to pristine mxene membrane 105 the rejection efficiency of 86 for tc antibiotic was reported by the employed membrane literature also reported the superior anti swelling characteristics of the mxene carboxylated cellulose nanofibers ti3c2tx cnfs based membranes in a water environment for up to 76 h 106 the employed membrane unveiled better separation performance with high pure water permeability of 26 0 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 and high selectivity rejection of antibiotics 99 0 for azithromycin 106 3 mxene based materials in other water treatment applications 3 1 mxenes as adsorbents for the removal of antibiotics and heavy metals the presence of toxic heavy metal ions even in trace amounts has a drastic influence on living organisms and the environment therefore the elimination of these lethal pollutants from the aqueous phase is an essential step in treating toxic effluents mxenes are an ideal candidate to be employed as adsorbents material for the enhanced uptake of various heavy metal ions from an aqueous environment since they exhibit unique physicochemical and structural characteristics such as numerous surface terminations large specific surface area hydrophilicity and electron richness 107 these adsorbents unveiled exceptional adsorption potentials for the successful elimination of heavy metal ions from an aqueous environment 94 96 numerous available functional groups and active sites for adsorption on the surfaces of the employed nanomaterials also contribute to the enhanced removal of toxic heavy metals 111 similar to the elimination of the heavy metals the mxene adsorbents have also revealed outstanding uptake performance for the confiscation of potentially toxic antibiotics from the water environment mxenes hold numerous active surface functional groups whose activity can be significantly increased under the action of the magnetic field and it is more evident with acidic functional groups 15 literature explained the development of the sodium alginate mxene cofe2o4 sa mx cfo composite material for the successful adsorption of cu2 and ciprofloxacin cip with an external magnetic field 15 the adsorption potential was reported to enhance by 3 53 and 24 19 against the selective removal of cu2 and cip when the employed adsorbent is subjected to the rotating magnetic field rmf the enhancement in adsorption potential with the help of rmf is ascribed to the following reasons i rmf could enhance the h bonding of the adsorbent surface that caused an exceptional rise in cip uptake ii the energy of the magnetic field is adsorbed by the target contaminants thus enhancing their kinetic energy and mass transfer capability and iii the cfo exhibit greater strength of the magnetic field at the micro interface compared to fe3o4 causing higher influence of the magnetic field for both pollutants and solutions 15 fig 6 illustrates the mechanism of barium ions uptake by the surface of the mxene layers in which both the physisorption and chemisorption are responsible for the ba adsorption 112 the mxene surface is generally terminated by the o oh and f functional groups after the etching process therefore these existing functional groups act as vacant active adsorption sites for ba ions to be adsorbed onto the adsorbent surface the adsorption of ba ions by the mxene s surface functional groups occurs by the following reactions to form ba oh 2 and ba f 2 ba2 2oh ba oh 2 ba2 2f ba f 2 such developed barium hydroxides and barium fluorides are the key ba constituent in an aqueous environment and they are chemisorbed onto the mxene surface literature also reported the removal of a range of pharmaceutical compounds amitriptyline amt verapamil carbamazepine 17 α ethinyl estradiol ibuprofen and diclofenac by the sonicated ti3c2tx mxene 113 the highest selective adsorption was reported for the amt with an adsorption capacity of 58 7 mg g 1 which is due to the electrostatic attraction between the positive amt molecules and the negative mxene surface the enhanced adsorption of the sonicated mxene compared to pristine mxene material is due to the creation of larger cavitation bubbles at lower frequencies that formed oxygenated functional groups on the mxene surface and also make well dispersed mxene another study reported the adsorption of cip by the alkaline intercalated mxene sodium ions si ti3c2tx and observed better adsorption performance compared to pristine mxene due to its high specific surface area and the broad layers layered spacing and vacant sites in which the pollutant molecules might be able to adsorb easily 114 besides the intercalation also caused more o and oh surface terminations to develop on the adsorbent surface which acts as active sites for cip adsorption in addition the adsorbent efficiency was also reported to marginally improved in succeeding regeneration stages 99 7 because of the nanosheets crystallinity loss enhancing amorphosity that in turn caused increased porosity and moieties hence resulting in the development of numerous active sites increasing specific surface area 114 table 3 and table 4 enlist various mxene based adsorbents and their successful applications in the removal of different heavy metal ions and antibiotics from an aqueous environment mxene based adsorbents unveiled enhanced adsorption potential against the elimination of antibiotics and toxic heavy metals in water treatment technologies these studies proposed the efficient employment of mxene based adsorbents in removing lethal contaminants and pollutants from an aqueous environment 3 2 mxenes as photo catalysts for degradation of antibiotics photo catalysis is regarded as one of the cost effective methods for the removal of various environmental contaminants 75 125 126 mxenes so far have been employed in various photo catalytic applications such as n2 fixation 126 128 co2 reduction 129 132 degradation of several pollutants 127 133 135 and water splitting 136 139 mxene could also improve the photo catalytic activity of the as developed composite in these applications by performing numerous functions including limiting the size of the photo catalyst enhancing reactant adsorption acting as robust support and promoting photo generated charge carrier separation 140 the successful use of mxenes in photo catalysis can be attributed primarily to the following factors i developing intimate contact interfaces between the mxene and other semiconductor materials and is facilitated by numerous available functional groups ii changing the surface chemistry caused by changing the bandgap alignment of the mxene and iii mxene has outstanding metallic conductivity and electron acceptance due to the conductive metallic core in its layered structure 141 in particular mxenes can be made hybridized with other substances like polymers graphene mofs etc to enhance their photo catalytic characteristics mxenes with distinct lamellar structures and high conductivity have been employed as co catalysts to enhance the photo catalytic degradation capabilities of composites 142 table 5 enlists various mxene based catalysts for the successful photo catalytic degradation of antibiotics the mxene based photo catalysts are also employed in literature for efficient environmental photo catalysis like the removal of a range of antibiotics and pharmaceuticals from an aqueous environment because of their fascinating characteristics such as adjustable band gap 0 92 1 75 ev appreciable safety hydrophilicity high strength and structural stability large surface area non toxicity high conductivity environmental flexibility and huge interlayer spacing 143 145 mxenes are distinguished by their lamellar nanostructures with high conductivity and these materials have the potential to improve the photo catalytic potential of their composites when employed as co catalysts 146 147 generally antibiotics in very low concentration have been perceived globally in a land environment and natural water and are used by humans and other industries such as aquaculture cattle and poultry thus can easily contaminate the environment 123 148 these could enter the environment via different pathways such as domestic wastewater industrial effluents and other waste streams and livestock wastewater 149 their continuous disposal eventually leads to their gradual accumulation in an aquatic environment and the soil from where they can also pass into the food chain mxenes have unveiled remarkable potential as co catalysts for the photo catalytic degradation of numerous pharmaceuticals because of their exceptional characteristics such as adjustable bandgap activated metallic hydroxide sites availability of numerous surface functional groups biocompatibility hydrophilicity high specific surface area high metallic conductivity ease of functionalization and fast photo generated charge carrier separation ability 75 140 a recent study assessed the confiscation of enrofloxacin antibiotic compounds from water by the use of newly developed multi functional adsorbent photo catalyst mxene tio2 composites by hydrothermal treatment 123 in addition to this the layered mxene structure can also enhance the photo catalytic activity by promoting the photo generated charge carrier separation limiting the size of photo catalysts enhancing reacting adsorption and acting as a robust support 140 the mxenes materials exhibited exceptional potential in the photo catalytic degradation of various antibiotics and pharmaceutical compounds mxenes can be also used as a host material to enhance the catalytic performance of different co catalysts numerous methods have been employed for the development of mxene based photo catalysts for successful degradation of pharmaceuticals such as anodization chemical vapor deposition in situ growth method sol hydrothermal method evaporation induced self assembly method in situ reductive deposition method 75 in the case of nh2 mil 125 ti tio2 ti3c2 for the efficient degradation of tc hcl the better photo catalytic performance of the hetero junction is ascribed to the enhanced characteristics after the ti3c2 incorporation which improved the charge transfer 150 the pharmaceutical tc hcl degradation includes the oh formation by water oxidation and electrons activation from the valence band vb to the conduction band cb for the employed nh2 mil 125 ti similarly the electron migration from the nh2 mil 125 ti cb to the tio2 cb and then from tio2 to ti3c2 transpires through the hetero junction the formation of the schottky junction performs as an electron trap to catch the photo induced electrons that are transferred to the ti3c2 surface for electron oxygen reduction in the case of the photo catalytic degradation of carbamazepine by the hetero structural tio2 ti3c2tx mxene the generated electrons at the surface of the tio2 are prohibited from being shifted to ti3c2tx sheets at the interface fig 7 a 151 such barred transferring is ascribed to the following reasons i mxene s work function is much lower compared to tio2 and ii mxene has a higher negative fermi level compared to the tio2 cb 151 another study reported the use of a novel cufe2o4 mxene cfo ti3c2 hetero junction photo catalyst that unveiled substantial synergic visible light degradation of sulfamethazine smz which is ascribed to the enhanced lifetime of carriers and photo electrons transfer in the employed composite 141 fig 7b illustrates the mechanism of the photocatalytic degradation of the smz by the employed cfo ti3c2 photo catalyst under visible light the cufe2o4 cfo with a band gap of 1 43 ev is excited by the visible light and the photo generated electrons are excited from the vb to cb in the case of cfo ti3c2 the photo induced electrons are shifted to the 2d ti3c2 from the cfo while numerous electrons appear near the fermi level in the ti3c2 flakes making it somehow metallic in nature trapping location for light induced electrons 141 moreover ti3c2 can also provide numerous active adsorption sites due to its large specific surface area besides the antibiotic molecules smz could also be adsorbed by the active material throughout the photo catalysis process fig 8 shows the smz degradation into the low molecular weight organic compounds aminobenzenes and methylpyrimidines 151 these studies reflect the importance of mxene based photo catalysts for the successful photo catalytic degradation of numerous antibiotics and pharmaceuticals in the next generation photo catalysis 4 comparison of mxene based membranes with other 2d materials mxenes are a new class of 2d materials along with 2d zeolites mofs cofs graphitic carbon nitride g c3n4 graphene graphene oxide go and layered tmdcs 60 159 162 there is a promising future for molecular separation applications using most of these 2d materials 163 164 two broad categories of 2d material based membranes are spongy nanosheet membranes and laminar membranes fig 9 159 additionally 2d materials can be employed as a filler to offset the characteristics of the polymeric membranes as shown in fig 10 a 165 the separation efficiency of 2d membranes depends on their physicochemical properties and molecular transport pathway the transport pathways of 2d materials can be manipulated to achieve a precise molecular separation nanochannels can form horizontal or vertical pathways in laminar membranes fig 10b and c 165 the frequently employed assembly for the non porous nanosheets such as mxenes and go are the laminar membranes although laminar membrane structure is expected to have less permeation rates compared to porous membranes such as porous graphene mofs and zeolite nanosheets however their facile synthesis methods still make them potential candidates for large scale applications 159 although a direct comparison of mxenes with other 2d materials is impractical because the performance of membranes can better be judged under similar conditions however this section aims to overview the efficiency of numerous 2d materials for the separation of specific pollutants including antibiotics and heavy metals a comparative analysis of mxene based membranes with membranes prepared from other 2d materials for the removal of selected pollutants is presented in table 6 the efficiency of mxene based membranes is comparable to or better than most of the 2d membranes offering in special cases separation efficiency as high as 99 and compelling productivities in terms of permeate flux this demonstrates the significance of using these membranes for water purification in the near future 5 conclusions challenges and future perspective this review covers a research gap dealing with the elucidation of the latest advances in mxenes membranes and materials adsorbents and photo catalysts for selective separations in water treatments including the removal of heavy metals and antibiotics these pollutants represent a serious environmental concern since they affect the quality of water bodies thus severely affecting living organisms here it has been proved the outperforming separation of mxenes membranes and materials for the removal of such toxic compounds moreover mxene based composites have drawn lots of interest as photo catalysts to degrade contaminants because of their outstanding thermal and optica characteristics hydrophilicity significant surface area configurable chemical characteristics high chemical stability regular planar configurations high metallic conductivity and so many derivative products it was found that literature reported numerous mxene based membranes with fascinating separation performance compared to other available 2d materials mxene based membranes have shown remarkable potential in water treatment but still there exist many challenges that need careful attention because these hurdles prevent them from their actual applications in the real water environment some of the key challenges and recommendations are summarized below the hf synthesis methods for the mass production of mxenes should be minimized because of their drastic ecological concerns and therefore other innovative and sustainable alternative green synthesis techniques should be adopted mxenes are currently produced on lab scale costly processes but with lower yields therefore mxene synthesis via commercial routes should be at the forefront of present day researchers to develop cheap efficient and environmentally friendly mxenes the application of mxene based membranes in the actual environment real water system should be explored since it is almost missing in the literature therefore these membranes should be at the forefront of future studies in order to challenge their efficacy in the actual water environment the mechanisms of pollutants from wastewater should be explored in much detail and an in depth analysis should be carried out by using different available characterization tools and theoretical models a particular focus should be placed on the regeneration of the membranes employed and the successful removal of pollutants retained on their surfaces this would achieve long term membrane stability by keeping its cost much lower and the membrane much more beneficial one of the key challenges is the storage and stability of mxene because of its oxidizing nature in the water environment therefore the future research area should cope with this trial by exploring different pathways for its mitigations this will help in developing the mxene s stability and its wide range of applications various theoretical and experimental methods should be adopted for optimum water fluxes through the studied membranes since these can be directly controlled by the flake sizes of the employed mxenes the stability of mxene nanosheets is a critical parameter in assessing its potential since it directly affects the overall lifespan of these materials therefore future research in this direction might lead to more stable mxene structures that in turn would be employed in treating a wide range of hazardous pollutants from actual wastewater streams the applications of mxene based membranes in removing simultaneous pollutants from an aqueous environment should be explored because real wastewater streams are comprised of different kinds of contaminants and pollutants the elimination of various pollutants by photo catalysis via the employment of mxenes should also be explored because extra efforts are needed to develop well connected interfaces to enhance photon adsorption and charge carrier transportation 173 this in turn would cause superior redox capability and enhanced interfacial arrangements which could develop efficient photocatalysts with robust degradation abilities various theoretical calculations such as the density functional theory and first principles methods should be explored and introduced into the design of the mxene based photo catalysts in order to envisage the future structural performance and understand the photo catalytic mechanism at the micro level and the overall photo catalytic process 145 critical and widespread research is needed in the development and applications of mxene based membranes for identifying crosslinkers and substrates for the membrane influencing its performance 174 author contribution statement faj conceptualization writing original draft preparation rcm reviewing methodology ii visualization

8737,the choice of constructed wetlands substrate is a very important issue there is still a lack of studies that analyse the effect of different types of substrate on the efficiency of the accumulate

selected contaminants from leachate the lowest translocation was recorded for fe and cu and the highest for k and ni translocation between root and shoots for most parameters total kjeldahl nitrogen total phosphorus k and mn was high tf 1 0 however for fe cu cr and ni translocation was low in most variants tf 1 0 only for cr there were statistically significant differences between the substrates

constructed wetlands vfcw landfill leachate phragmites australis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction many industrial sectors generate wastewater 1 4 which in excessive quantities can cause serious environmental damage municipal solid waste msw leachate can contain a wide range of contaminants among them soluble organic compounds inorganic contaminants suspended solids heavy metals and hazardous substances 5 6 the most commonly reported include ammonium nitrogen chlorides sulphates and heavy metals 7 9 to reduce the negative impact of landfill leachate on the environment different treatment methods are used biological physical and chemical 10 particularly noteworthy are solutions based on the use of plants to among other things reduce remove or immobilise pollutants i e phytoremediation in its broadest sense cw are classified as biological methods using phytoremediation for treatment of among others contaminated liquids 11 12 they are designed and constructed to use natural processes to remove contaminants in a more controlled environment 13 the main mechanisms of contaminant removal in cw include phytofiltration phytoextraction phytostabilisation phytovolatilisation phytodesalination and phytodegradation 12 14 some of the most important measures of phytoremediation effectiveness include the bioconcentration factor the ratio of the concentration of a compound in the external environment to the concentration found in plant tissue and the translocation factor the ratio of the concentration in the shoots to the content in the roots of the plant 15 16 cws have been successfully treating various types of wastewater for decades their popularity is due to their low maintenance costs low energy input high pollutant removal efficiency and environmental friendliness among others 17 due to their numerous advantages they have been recognised as a very good solution for wastewater treatment 18 plants play an important role in cw which should have a high capacity to survive in potentially toxic and variable conditions 19 in recent years p australis common reed is very often used in phytoremediation of contaminated water soil and sediments 20 this species is classified as a common emergent macrophyte found on almost all continents and has a high capacity to adapt to changing environmental conditions 21 furthermore it is an inexpensive and undemanding species with a fast growth rate high biomass production and a deep root system 22 23 also the correct choice of substrate in cw is very important among other things because it forms basis for the growth of plants and microorganisms in substrates filtration adsorption sedimentation flocculation precipitation and ion exchange take place they are also an inexpensive and plant safe way to enhance phytoremediation including phytostabilisation research shows that the right choice of substrates can significantly improve the efficiency of contaminant removal in cw 24 both natural materials such as zeolite or pine bark which can be a by product of timber industry and specially produced materials such as expanded clay are used as substrates in cw 25 mineral substrates perform well in cw due to their high adsorption capacity while organic substrates promote plant establishment and growth due to their organic and nutrient content 26 27 to date many studies have been conducted on the treatment of different types of wastewater in cw phytoremediation has also been addressed many times e g from tannery wastewater by penisetum purpureum brachiaria decumbens and phragmites australis in cw gravel beds 28 boron containing leachate by different plant species four poplar and willow species in cw 29 or from mercury

subsurface vertical flow cw systems vfcw k r s and 30 phytoremediation of landfill leachate using water hyacinth and water lettuce 31 or removal of organic pollutants by effluent recirculation cw system treating landfill leachate 32 although the treatment of different types of wastewater in cw using a variety of plant species has already been the subject of many studies but there is still a need for research to further understand the treatment mechanisms in cw 29 the choice of cw substrates is a very important issue because a properly selected substrate can be a good way to improve the phytoremediation process there is still a lack of studies that analyse the effect of different types of substrate on the efficiency of the phytoremediation of ll 33 enhancement of the phytoremediation process through the role of substrates in cw still requires further research 24 the few studies that have been conducted so far have analysed the effect of the applied substrate on the potential of plants in cw to accumulate and translocate selected pollutants from landfill leachate the study of accumulation and translocation in cw is important to better understand and evaluate this treatment process therefore the authors decided to conduct research the objectives of this study were i evaluate off the effect of applied substrate on the potential of p australis to accumulate and translocate selected contaminants from ll in cw and ii determination of the bioaccumulation and translocation of elements in p australis tissues 2 materials and methods 2 1 landfill leachate used in the study two municipal waste landfills with leachate drainage systems located in the lower silesia province poland were selected for the study one of the landfills located in legnica n 51 14 21 317 e 16 11 0 251 has been in operation since 1977 until now it has a total capacity of 2 3 million m3 and the total area is 14 2 ha the second storage site located in jawor n 51 3 56 112 e 16 12 38 927 has been in operation since 1977 and was closed at the end of 2020 its total capacity is 231 000 m3 while the total area is 3 37 ha the leachate from these landfills was not highly contaminated but in the case of most parameters even after dilution 25 landfill leachate ll it did not meet the requirements imposed by the polish law regulation of me of 12 july 2019 which would allow its direct discharge into water or soil therefore before discharge into the environment it was necessary to treat them the prepared models of cw were dosed with raw leachates from both landfills described above legnica and jawor and leachate at 25 concentration diluted with tap water also from both landfills the final choice of dilution 25 was based on previous toxicity analyzes and studies on the physicochemical

the cw filling variant bark zeolite expanded clay did not meet the legal requirements for discharge to water or to the ground a detailed description of the results of the physicochemical properties of the leachate before and after treatment in cw was presented in ref 33 3 1 translocation of selected contaminants by p australis tf represents the translocation of elements from underground to above ground parts of plants because it is the ratio of metal concentrations in the upper parts of plants to metal concentrations in the roots 45 table 2 presents the translocation of selected contaminants from cw with different substrates bark zeolite leca into which leachates from two landfills in jawor and legnica were dosed at 25 and 100 concentration translocation within plant tissues is dependent on plant species element and a range of environmental conditions such as ph reduction potential temperature or salinity also the parameters of the substrate used such as particle size organic matter content nutrients and the presence of other ions can affect the uptake and translocation of contaminants 46 when analysing the mobility of elements from roots to stems it was observed that the translocation factor tf varied between the types of substrate in the cw and the landfills from which the leachate originated 47 suggested that a substrate may affect metal translocation for 100 ll in total for all parameters analysed the highest tf was obtained in the cw with bark substrate and the lowest with zeolite substrate which could be due to the properties of the bark section 2 3 i e high organic matter content nutrients and the presence of other ions which could also influence the high tf 46 analysis of variance showed statistically significant differences between tf values for the zeolite bark bark leca substrate pairs fig 2 on the other hand for 25 ll in total for all parameters the highest tf was observed in cw with zeolite and the lowest with bark substrate the differences between the values for the analysed substrates were not statistically significant analysing the translocation of the selected parameters together without differentiating by the applied substrates origin and doses of dosed leachates it can be observed that the lowest translocation was shown by fe and cu and the highest by k and ni which confirms that tf varies depending on the type of contamination 48 the low fe translocation factor values indicate that p australis accumulates fe mainly in underground tissues and inhibits its entry into important cellular organs such as mitochondria and cell nuclei which is consistent with the results obtained by other researchers who also observed low tf values for fe 49 50 low translocation rates were also observed for cu confirming that cu accumulates mainly in plant roots and shows low mobility from roots to aboveground organs this was also observed by stoltz et al and bonnano et al 51 52 indicating that underground organs are the main areas of accumulation of metals including cu the highest translocation rate was recorded for k which has high mobility making it not readily available to plants 53 also for ni high tf values were obtained confirming that ni is highly mobile and is therefore highly transported both from the substrate to the roots and to other plant tissues 54 higher tf values were mostly obtained in cws dosed with 100 ll than with 25 ll but these were not large differences the exceptions were three parameters i e tkn k and ni where higher tf was recorded in cw with 25 ll in most cases the differences in tf values were not large and ranged from 0 7 to 0 9 root stem translocation in p australis for most parameters tkn tp k and mn in both cw with 25 ll and 100 ll was high i e tf 1 0 mn showed high mobility and in most cases tf was 1 0 with the exception of 25 ll legnica jawor and 100 ll jawor leca and legnica bark where tf was 1 0 the high values of manganese translocation factor can be explained by the fact that it plays an important metabolic role 55 in contrast root stem translocation for fe cu cr and ni in both cw with 25 ll and 100 ll was mostly low and 1 0 3 2 bioaccumulation of selected pollutants by p australis table 3 presents the bioconcentration of selected pollutants in cw with different substrates bark zeolite leca into which leachates from two landfills in jawor and legnica were dosed at 25 and 100 concentration the bioconcentration factor bcf measures the ability of a plant to accumulate elements from the substrate 56 some researchers consider plants with a bcf of 1 0 to be a good accumulator 44 however others consider that a good metal accumulator should have a much higher bcf i e 1000 57 58 for most parameters tkn tp k fe mn in all variants irrespective of the origin and selected concentration of leachate and the applied substrate zeolite bark and leca bcf values were 1 0 only in a few cases bcf values above 1000 were recorded i e for fe and mn parameters in 100 ll analysing the total bcf values obtained without differentiating between substrate types and landfills it was observed that bcf values were significantly higher in underground tissues than in aboveground tissues and in 100 ll than in 25 ll the higher bcf values in underground tissues may be due to a defence mechanism of the plant thanks to the strategy of preventing the movement of toxic substances from the roots to the aboveground organs the plant protects itself from their harmful effects among others on photosynthesis processes 59 in most cases the highest bcfs in total for both landfills and all parameters were recorded on bark substrates which may be due to its properties section 2 3 as it is known the high content of organic matter and nutrients can affect the uptake and transport of pollutants 46 only for underground tissues at 25 concentration the highest bcf was achieved on leca substrate which was due to the high accumulation of fe on this substrate bcf for fe 381 46 it can be observed from this study that nitrogen accumulates mainly in aboveground tissues irrespective of the applied ll dilution higher total bcf values for tkn were recorded in aboveground tissues in 100 ll i e bcf total 410 42 aboveground tissues and 318 4 underground tissues than in 25 ll where bcf total 39 29 aboveground tissues and 23 89 underground tissues higher nitrogen accumulation in aboveground tissues than in underground tissues was also noted by others in their studies 60 comparing the substrates used in the cw to which 100 ll was dosed the highest total bcf was recorded for tkn on bark substrates which could be due to the influence of the high organic matter and nutrient content of the substrate used 46 the differences found were not statistically significant fig 3 on the other hand in cw where 25 ll was dosed the highest total bcf occurred on zeolite substrates analysis of variance showed that the bcf values for zeolite substrates for the aboveground parts of the plants were significantly different from the values found for the underground parts and bark and leca substrates fig 3 phosphorus like nitrogen accumulates mainly in aboveground tissues regardless of the ll dilution used higher total bcf for tp was recorded in aboveground tissues in 100 ll i e bcf total 229 82 aboveground tissues and 171 55 belowground tissues than in 25 ll where bcf total 29 16 aboveground tissues and 23 82 belowground tissues in both 25 ll and 100 ll comparing the substrates used the highest bcf for tp was recorded on the bark substrates which was most likely due to the presence of phosphorus in the substrate 756 mg kg during the study it was observed that the accumulation capacity of phosphorus in p australis tissues was much lower than that of nitrogen the total bcf for tkn was 792 while that for tp was 454 3 confirming that macrophytes are better at accumulating nitrogen this was also observed during nitrogen and phosphorus accumulation studies in cw with horizontal subsurface flow 60 potassium k is an essential nutrient for plant growth right after nitrogen n and phosphorus p due to the fact that it moves easily in the environment it is not readily available for uptake by plants leading to economic losses 53 the bioaccumulation factor of k varied quite strongly between the dilutions and substrates used significantly higher bcf values for k were obtained in 100 ll than in 25 ll and in underground tissues than in aboveground tissues the higher bcf values in underground tissues may be due to the fact that k is mainly taken up by the roots in cw where 100 ll was dosed quite large differences were observed between the applied fills the highest bcf value was achieved on zeolite substrates followed by leca and bark statistically significant differences in bcf values for k occurred for the aboveground parts of plants growing on zeolite and leca media versus the underground parts of plants on leca media fig 3 the high bcf for k in the case of zeolite substrates can be explained by the fact that zeolites are very efficient ion exchangers and perform well in retaining k 53 bcf of fe in underground tissues was significantly higher than bcf in aboveground tissues regardless of the substrate used origin and ll concentration also other researchers 49 have observed a significantly higher accumulation of fe in roots than in aboveground tissues by concentrating fe in the roots the plant increases its tolerance to unfavourable environmental conditions 49 high bioaccumulation rates were recorded for mn which may be due to the fact that p australis is very tolerant to high concentrations of mn and can accumulate it in large quantities in its tissues 61 irrespective of ll concentration higher mn contents were recorded in aboveground tissues compared to underground tissues in contrast others during the study observed higher mn contents in roots 61 in several studies 47 62 have shown that p australis is a good accumulator of heavy metals however in this study it was observed that regardless of the selected leachate concentration or the type of substrate for most metals cu cr and ni the bcf was low i e bcf 1 0 only in the case of cu in 100 ll from jawor the bcf was slightly above 1 0 the results obtained show that this species does not have a good ability to phytoaccumulate heavy metals cu cr and ni from landfill leachate in cw this coincides with the results of other authors who also found that p australis does not perform well as a metal accumulator 47 50 in addition the results obtained confirm that plant uptake plays a minor role in the removal of heavy metals from leachate in cw 63 statistically significant differences between the bcf values occurred for cr related to the underground parts of the plants and the bark and leca substrate fig 3 4 conclusions after treatment of leachate in cw there were differences in many cases that made it difficult to clearly assess the effectiveness of the reduction of selected parameters on the substrates used 1 translocation of selected elements in p australis tissues differed between the parameters analysed in most cases higher tf values were recorded in cw dosed with 100 ll the lowest translocation was recorded for fe and cu and the highest for k and ni translocation between root and shoots for most parameters tkn tp k and mn was high tf 1 0 however for fe cu cr and ni translocation was low in some variants tf 1 0 only for cr there were statistically significant differences between the substrates 2 in all cases higher bioaccumulation was observed in underground tissues than in aboveground tissues in most cases higher bcf values were recorded at 100 ll than at 25 ll the substrate of pine bark had the greatest effect on the accumulation of selected contaminants in p australis and in most cases the highest total bcf values were recorded there the bcf values found only in a few cases tkn k and cr showed significant differences between the tested fills and plant parts 3 the obtained bcf values for cu cr and ni show that p australis does not have a good ability to phytoaccumulate heavy

constructed wetlands vfcw landfill leachate phragmites australis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction many industrial sectors generate wastewater 1 4 which in excessive quantities can cause serious environmental damage municipal solid waste msw leachate can contain a wide range of contaminants among them soluble organic compounds inorganic contaminants suspended solids heavy metals and hazardous substances 5 6 the most commonly reported include ammonium nitrogen chlorides sulphates and heavy metals 7 9 to reduce the negative impact of landfill leachate on the environment different treatment methods are used biological physical and chemical 10 particularly noteworthy are solutions based on the use of plants to among other things reduce remove or immobilise pollutants i e phytoremediation in its broadest sense cw are classified as biological methods using phytoremediation for treatment of among others contaminated liquids 11 12 they are designed and constructed to use natural processes to remove contaminants in a more controlled environment 13 the main mechanisms of contaminant removal in cw include phytofiltration phytoextraction phytostabilisation phytovolatilisation phytodesalination and phytodegradation 12 14 some of the most important measures of phytoremediation effectiveness include the bioconcentration factor the ratio of the concentration of a compound in the external environment to the concentration found in plant tissue and the translocation factor the ratio of the concentration in the shoots to the content in the roots of the plant 15 16 cws have been successfully treating various types of wastewater for decades their popularity is due to their low maintenance costs low energy input high pollutant removal efficiency and environmental friendliness among others 17 due to their numerous advantages they have been recognised as a very good solution for wastewater treatment 18 plants play an important role in cw which should have a high capacity to survive in potentially toxic and variable conditions 19 in recent years p australis common reed is very often used in phytoremediation of contaminated water soil and sediments 20 this species is classified as a common emergent macrophyte found on almost all continents and has a high capacity to adapt to changing environmental conditions 21 furthermore it is an inexpensive and undemanding species with a fast growth rate high biomass production and a deep root system 22 23 also the correct choice of substrate in cw is very important among other things because it forms basis for the growth of plants and microorganisms in substrates filtration adsorption sedimentation flocculation precipitation and ion exchange take place they are also an inexpensive and plant safe way to enhance phytoremediation including phytostabilisation research shows that the right choice of substrates can significantly improve the efficiency of contaminant removal in cw 24 both natural materials such as zeolite or pine bark which can be a by product of timber industry and specially produced materials such as expanded clay are used as substrates in cw 25 mineral substrates perform well in cw due to their high adsorption capacity while organic substrates promote plant establishment and growth due to their organic and nutrient content 26 27 to date many studies have been conducted on the treatment of different types of wastewater in cw phytoremediation has also been addressed many times e g from tannery wastewater by penisetum purpureum brachiaria decumbens and phragmites australis in cw gravel beds 28 boron containing leachate by different plant species four poplar and willow species in cw 29 or from mercury

system treating landfill leachate 32 although the treatment of different types of wastewater in cw using a variety of plant species has already been the subject of many studies but there is still a need for research to further understand the treatment mechanisms in cw 29 the choice of cw substrates is a very important issue because a properly selected substrate can be a good way to improve the phytoremediation process there is still a lack of studies that analyse the effect of different types of substrate on the efficiency of the phytoremediation of ll 33 enhancement of the phytoremediation process through the role of substrates in cw still requires further research 24 the few studies that have been conducted so far have analysed the effect of the applied substrate on the potential of plants in cw to accumulate and translocate selected pollutants from landfill leachate the study of accumulation and translocation in cw is important to better understand and evaluate this treatment process therefore the authors decided to conduct research the objectives of this study were i evaluate off the effect of applied substrate on the potential of p australis to accumulate and translocate selected contaminants from ll in cw and ii determination of the bioaccumulation and translocation of elements in p australis tissues 2 materials and methods 2 1 landfill leachate used in the study two municipal waste landfills with leachate drainage systems located in the lower silesia province poland were selected for the study one of the landfills located in legnica n 51 14 21 317 e 16 11 0 251

operation since 1977 and was closed at the end of 2020 its total capacity is 231 000 m3 while the total area is 3 37 ha the leachate from these landfills was not highly contaminated but in the case of most parameters even after dilution 25 landfill leachate ll it did not meet the requirements imposed by the polish law regulation of me of 12 july 2019 which would allow its direct discharge into water or soil therefore before discharge into the environment it was necessary to treat them the prepared models of cw were dosed with raw leachates from both landfills described above legnica and jawor and leachate at 25 concentration diluted with tap water also from both landfills the final choice of dilution 25 was based on previous toxicity analyzes and studies on the physicochemical

showed high mobility and in most cases tf was 1 0 with the exception of 25 ll legnica jawor and 100 ll jawor leca and legnica bark where tf was 1 0 the high values of manganese translocation factor can be explained by the fact that it plays an important metabolic role 55 in contrast root stem translocation for fe cu cr and ni in both cw with 25 ll and 100 ll was mostly low and 1 0 3 2 bioaccumulation of selected pollutants by p australis table 3 presents the bioconcentration of selected pollutants in cw with different substrates bark zeolite leca into which leachates from two landfills in jawor and legnica were dosed at 25 and 100 concentration the bioconcentration factor bcf measures the ability of a plant to accumulate elements from the substrate 56 some researchers consider plants with a bcf of 1 0 to be a good accumulator 44 however others consider that a good metal accumulator should have a much higher bcf i e 1000 57 58 for most parameters tkn tp k fe mn in all variants irrespective of the origin and selected concentration of leachate and the applied substrate zeolite bark and leca bcf values were 1 0 only in a few cases bcf values above 1000 were recorded i e for fe and mn parameters in 100 ll analysing the total bcf values obtained without differentiating between substrate types and landfills it was observed that bcf values were significantly higher in underground tissues than in aboveground tissues and in 100 ll than in 25 ll the higher bcf values in underground tissues may be due to a defence mechanism of the plant thanks to the strategy of preventing the movement of toxic substances from the roots to the aboveground organs the plant protects itself from their harmful effects among others on photosynthesis processes 59 in most cases the highest bcfs in total for both landfills and all parameters were recorded on bark substrates which may be due to its properties section 2 3 as it is known the high content of organic matter and nutrients can affect the uptake and transport of pollutants 46 only for underground tissues at 25 concentration the highest bcf was achieved on leca substrate which was due to the high accumulation of fe on this substrate bcf for fe 381 46 it can be observed from this study that nitrogen accumulates mainly in aboveground tissues irrespective of the applied ll dilution higher total bcf values for tkn were recorded in aboveground tissues in 100 ll i e bcf total 410 42 aboveground tissues and 318 4 underground tissues than in 25 ll where bcf total 39 29 aboveground tissues and 23 89 underground tissues higher nitrogen accumulation in aboveground tissues than in underground tissues was also noted by others in their studies 60 comparing the substrates used in the cw to which 100 ll was dosed the highest total bcf was recorded for tkn on bark substrates which could be due to the influence of the high organic matter and nutrient content of the substrate used 46 the differences found were not statistically significant fig 3 on the other hand in cw where 25 ll was dosed the highest total bcf occurred on zeolite substrates analysis of variance showed that the bcf values for zeolite substrates for the aboveground parts of the plants were significantly different from the values found for the underground parts and bark and leca substrates fig 3 phosphorus like nitrogen accumulates mainly in aboveground tissues regardless of the ll dilution used higher total bcf for tp was recorded in aboveground tissues in 100 ll i e bcf total 229 82 aboveground tissues and 171 55 belowground tissues than in 25 ll where bcf total 29 16 aboveground tissues and 23 82 belowground tissues in both 25 ll and 100 ll comparing the substrates used the highest bcf for tp was recorded on the bark substrates which was most likely due to the presence of phosphorus in the substrate 756 mg kg during the study it was observed that the accumulation capacity of phosphorus in p australis tissues was much lower than that of nitrogen the total bcf for tkn was 792 while that for tp was 454 3 confirming that macrophytes are better at accumulating nitrogen this was also observed during nitrogen and phosphorus accumulation studies in cw with horizontal subsurface flow 60 potassium k is an essential nutrient for plant growth right after nitrogen n and phosphorus p due to the fact that it moves easily in the environment it is not readily available for uptake by plants leading to economic losses 53 the bioaccumulation factor of k varied quite strongly between the dilutions and substrates used significantly higher bcf values for k were obtained in 100 ll than in 25 ll and in underground tissues than in aboveground tissues the higher bcf values in underground tissues may be due to the fact that k is mainly taken up by the roots in cw where 100 ll was dosed quite large differences were observed between the applied fills the highest bcf value was achieved on zeolite substrates followed by leca and bark statistically significant differences in bcf values for k occurred for the aboveground parts of plants growing on zeolite and leca media versus the underground parts of plants on leca media fig 3 the high bcf for k in the case of zeolite substrates can be explained by the fact that zeolites are very efficient ion exchangers and perform well in retaining k 53 bcf of fe in underground tissues was significantly higher than bcf in aboveground tissues regardless of the substrate used origin and ll concentration also other researchers 49 have observed a significantly higher accumulation of fe in roots than in aboveground tissues by concentrating fe in the roots the plant increases its tolerance to unfavourable environmental conditions 49 high bioaccumulation rates were recorded for mn which may be due to the fact that p australis is very tolerant to high concentrations of mn and can accumulate it in large quantities in its tissues 61 irrespective of ll concentration higher mn contents were recorded in aboveground tissues compared to underground tissues in contrast others during the study observed higher mn contents in roots 61 in several studies 47 62 have shown that p australis is a good accumulator of heavy metals however in this study it was observed that regardless of the selected leachate concentration or the type of substrate for most metals cu cr and ni the bcf was low i e bcf 1 0 only in the case of cu in 100 ll from jawor the bcf was slightly above 1 0 the results obtained show that this species does not have a good ability to phytoaccumulate heavy metals cu cr and ni from landfill leachate in cw this coincides with the results of other authors who also found that p australis does not perform well as a metal accumulator 47 50 in addition the results obtained confirm that plant uptake plays a minor role in the removal of heavy metals from leachate in cw 63 statistically significant differences between the bcf values occurred for cr related to the underground parts of the plants and the bark and leca substrate fig 3 4 conclusions after treatment of leachate in cw there were differences in many cases that made it difficult to clearly assess the effectiveness of the reduction of selected parameters on the substrates used 1 translocation of selected elements in p australis tissues differed between the parameters analysed in most cases higher tf values were recorded in cw dosed with 100 ll the lowest translocation was recorded for fe and cu and the highest for k and ni translocation between root and shoots for most parameters tkn tp k and mn was high tf 1 0 however for fe cu cr and ni translocation was low in some variants tf 1 0 only for cr there were statistically significant differences between the substrates 2 in all cases higher bioaccumulation was observed in underground tissues than in aboveground tissues in most cases higher bcf values were recorded at 100 ll than at 25 ll the substrate of pine bark had the greatest effect on the accumulation of selected contaminants in p australis and in most cases the highest total bcf values were recorded there the bcf values found only in a few cases tkn k and cr showed significant differences between the tested fills and plant parts 3 the obtained bcf values for cu cr and ni show that p australis does not have a good ability to phytoaccumulate heavy

8738,tannery wastewater tww is a toxic and hazardous effluent that causes great harm to receiving ecosystems if released untreated here magnesium oxide nanoparticles mgo nps synthesized from low cost and readily available magnesite were used for the treatment of real tww under batch laboratory conditions the optimum treatment conditions were 90 min contact time and 10 g mgo nps dosage per l of real tww under ambient ph and temperature results were underpinned by state of the art analytical techniques including icp oes xrd xrf and fib eds sem along with geochemical modelling phreeqc the

with alkalinity addition through mgo dissolution that lead to contaminants precipitation the phreeqc geochemical model confirmed the existence of divalent trivalent oxyanions and multivalent chemical species in mgo nps tww solution including complexes contaminants attenuation was achieved through precipitation co precipitation adsorption and co adsorption while these were removed as hydroxides sulfides carbonates oxide and oxyhydrosulfates overall results highlight the great potential of mgo nps for the sustainable management of real tww graphical abstract image 1 keywords tannery and textile wastewater activated mgo nanoparticles toxic heavy metals and salts metals precipitation thermal and mechano chemical activation ph redox equilibrium in c language phreeqc water reclamation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction consumerism along with rapid population growth have notably increased the demand for various resources including clothing and textiles as such the textile and tannery industries have emerged as important growth drivers in many countries but at the same time they are responsible for releasing a wide array of contaminants to receiving environments for example for leather and hides processing the tannery industry uses among others in organic and nitrogenous compounds metals and acids 1 2 therefore the respective effluents are rich in both organic and inorganic chemicals have high chemical oxygen demand cod and biochemical oxygen demand bod while salts suspended matter and organic carbon can also be present 2 specifically tannery wastewater tww is rich in dissolved salts cod bod organics dyes suspended solids and highly toxic chemical species such as fe al mn cr cu ni u sb and as along with base metals such as ca and mg 2 4 as such tww poses serious toxicological effects to living organisms upon exposure while the presence of color not only affect the aesthetic quality but also further exasperates its negative effects since among others it blocks the hunting ability of aquatic organisms and hinders photosynthesis 2 5 untreated tww can also affect agriculture and water and food security therefore different regulators such as the u s environmental protection agency epa 6 the world health organization who 7 and the south african department of water and sanitation dws 8 have specified strict discharge limits for treated wastewater matrices however currently very large volumes of tww are produced which have low biodegradability are highly mineralized and contain complex and toxic chemical constituents 3 therefore the sustainable management of tww remains a challenge and particularly in low and middle income countries lmic 3 4 different technologies have been proposed for tww treatment 3 which rely on different mechanisms including biological processes 9 oxidation 10 adsorption 11 filtration 12 precipitation 3 13 ion exchange 14 and bioremediation 15 each technology has its strengths and weaknesses adsorption is typically cost effective and easy to apply for water treatment even in remote areas 16 however it exhibits quick saturation and limited capacity in concentrated and multi component solutions such as tww whereas even though filtration and ion exchange exhibit high treatment efficiencies they are costly energy intensive and are associated with secondary pollution membranes generate brines while ion exchange resins regenerant wastes 2 17 18 on the other hand wetlands and biological treatment can be cost effective however large areas and long hydraulic retention times hrts are typically required while when used for the treatment of toxic and bio recalcitrant wastewaters they have limited efficacy in contaminants removal 19 moreover other technologies such as photocatalytic oxidation 20 21 and electrocoagulation 22 23 can be complex for real world applications and selective in terms of contaminants removal therefore research has also focused on new technologies that can effectively and sustainably treat tww with nanomaterials such as metal oxides having emerged as particularly promising in this regard due to their adsorption and photocatalytic properties 1 2 4 specifically fouda et al 2 assessed the catalytic degradation ability of hematite α fe2o3 and magnesium oxide mgo nanoparticles nps for textile and tannery wastewater treatment and large reductions in total suspended solids tss total dissolved solids tds metal content cr pb ni and cd and cod were observed oladipo et al 1 reported the application of bio derived mgo

treatment ph bod cod tds tss and electrical conductivity ec of tww 24 25 our research group also evaluated the use of mgo nps for the removal of boron 26 27 fluoride 28 arsenic 29 30 phosphate 31 33 and metals 34 36 other groups also demonstrated the successful application of mgo nps for water and wastewater treatment 2 24 25 34 37 40 therefore the body of knowledge suggest that mgo nps are promising for the treatment of tww however a study that comprehensively examines the removal of a wide range of contaminants from real tww when using mgo nps is still pending furthermore the efficiency of mgo nps derived from cryptocrystalline magnesite a low cost and readily available material for the treatment of real tww has not yet being comprehensively examined this chemical precipitation process is appealing to industries as compared to adsorption in light of the above this study seeks to expand the scope and comprehensively examine the efficiency of mgo nps produced through a facile synthesis process from cryptocrystalline magnesite for the treatment of real tww as such this is the first study in design and execution to explore the potential application of mgo nps synthesized from cryptocrystalline magnesite that examines its efficiency for the removal of a wide range of contaminants including fe u al mn cr sb ni as cu so4 cod and toc from real tww results were underpinned by state of the art analytical techniques and geochemical modelling phreeqc while the large and readily available cryptocrystalline magnesite reserves 41 can render this technology a new and sustainable avenue for the effective treatment of tww in south africa and further afield 2 materials and methods 2 1 magnesium oxide nanoparticles preparation the parent material of the mgo nps was south african cryptocrystalline magnesite which was procured from sterkfontein carbonates pty ltd south africa the procured magnesite was pulverized ball milled and passed through a 32 μm sieve to obtained homogenous cryptocrystalline magnesite nps the milled and sieved samples were then activated i e magnesite was converted to mgo through thermal processing calcination at 1100 c for 1 h 42 the produced mgo was then re milled and was again passed through the 32 μm sieve to obtain the desired mgo nps the mgo nps were then stored in a zip lock plastic bag until utilisation for the treatment of real tww 2 2 tannery wastewater collection and treatment the tww was collected from a tannery and textile industry located in brits north west south africa the wastewater was hand collected using 25 l wide mouth high density polyethylene hdpe bottles to ensure that the wastewater was free of suspended solids gravity filtration was employed using a macherey nagel filter paper mn 615 ø125mm thereafter the filtered samples were moved to the laboratory and treated with the produced mgo nps laboratory quality assurance and data quality control was ensured by carrying out all measurements in an iso iec 17025 2017 accredited laboratory i e at the magalies water services laboratory brits north west south africa 2 3 optimization studies to study the effect of the main operational parameters i e contact time and mgo nps dosage a wide range of values were examined for each parameter and the optimum conditions were identified ambient temperature i e room temperature range 18 22 c and ph were considered since in industrial treatment systems the ph and particularly the temperature are not typically controlled 2 3 1 effect of contact time the collected tww was first divided into 25 aliquots of 1 l each and then seven of those aliquots were transferred into separate laboratory beakers in each beaker 7 5 g of the produced mgo nps was added and different mixing durations contact time were examined specifically seven contact times ranging from as low as 5 min to as high as 180 min were examined i e 5 10 15 30 60 90 and 180 min mixing was achieved by means of an overhead stirrer pb 900 phipps bird programmable jar tester w illuminator the mixtures were allowed to settle and then each supernatant was passed through a macherey nagel filter paper mn 615 ø125mm gravity filtration the treated effluents and the collected solid samples were then characterized using state of the art techniques that are described below the optimum contact time was then used as a fixed parameter for the optimization of the mgo nps dosage 2 3 2 effect of magnesium oxide nanoparticles dosage a similar procedure was followed for the optimization of the mgo nps dosage i e the mgo nps mass per tww volume whereby 5 aliquots were transferred to five laboratory beakers and dosed with a different masses of mgo nps specifically the examined mgo nps dosages were 2 5 5 7 5 10 and 12 5 g per aloquot 1 l of real tww each dosed aliquot was then mixed using the identified optimum contact time again by means of an overhead stirrer pb 900 phipps bird programmable jar tester w illuminator then each mixture was allowed to settle and the supernatant was passed through a macherey nagel filter paper mn 615 ø125mm finally it should be noted that all experiments were carried out in triplicate and results are expressed as mean values in all cases very low standard deviations sdvs were observed ranging between 0 01 0 5 suggesting the high accuracy of the measured values 2 4 characterization 2 4 1 aqueous samples characterization the ec and ph of the raw and treated tww were measured using a portable meter hach hq40d metals metalloids anions and oxyanions were determined using the following instruments i inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes agilent s 5110 vertical dual view equipped with agilent s sps 4 high performance auto sampler ii thermo scientific s discreet gallery plus uv vis photo spectrometer and iii a total organic carbon analyzer shimadzu toc l cph detection limit of 0 1 mg l 1 ppm of c for the analysis of the raw and treated tww standard methods were followed as described elsewhere 43 2 4 2 solid samples characterization to support and complement the results of the aqueous samples raw and treated tww both the produced mgo nps as well as the reacted mgo nps i e the solid material sludge that was generated and precipitated after mgo nps came into contact with the real tww were also characterized for these solid samples the elemental and microstructural properties i e morphology elemental mapping elemental composition spot analysis and metal functional groups were estimated to this end a field emission scanning electron microscope fesem equipped with focused ion beam fib and an energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds zeiss auriga fib fesem eds was used to identify the elemental and microstructural properties while elemental compositions were also ascertained by means of x ray fluorescence xrf thermo scientific s arl perform x sequential xrf spectrometer equipped with uniquant software for standardless analysis the functional groups were determined using fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy perkinelmer s spectrum 100 ftir instrument equipped with a perkinelmer precisely universal attenuated total reflectance atr sampling accessory with a diamond crystal finally the crystalline phases were determined using x ray diffraction xrd malvern panalytical aeris edition equipped with a pixcel detector for quality assurance and control solid sample characterization was performed at south africa s national centre for nanostructured materials ncnsm council for scientific and industrial research csir 2 5 geochemical modeling to verify and complement the experimental results geochemical modelling by means of the ph redox equilibrium phreeqc computer program in c language was employed phreeqc is a robust geochemical model since it can perform a wide array of different aqueous geochemical calculations including speciation distribution of aqueous species and inverse geochemical calculations 44 45 here phreeqc was used to determine both the aqueous species and the possible mineral phases that are most likely to be generated from the interaction of the produced mgo nps with the tww specifically based on the composition of the real tww the saturation indices sis of the possible mineral phases were calculated for this reason the wateq4f chemical speciation program which includes databases for elemental speciation in water was used 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of contact time first the results for the effect of contact time mixing duration on tww treatment efficiency are presented as mentioned above seven mixing durations i e 5 10 15 30 60 90 and 180 min were examined and results are shown in fig 1 as shown in fig 1 there was an increase in the percentage removal of the contaminants contained in the real tww with increasing contact time until they reach equilibrium the different plateaus shown in fig 1 specifically each contaminant reaches its maximum percentage removal at a different contact time which traces back to the different reaction kinetics and thus highlight the importance of contact time for al fe and cr a rapid removal was observed within the first 20 min of the mgo nps tww interaction while mn was practically removed at the next examined contact time i e 30 min toc percentage removal exhibited a steep increase up until 30 min contact time and thereafter the percentage removal slowly increased and reached equilibrium at 90 min the percentage removal of cod also reached equilibrium at 90 min contact time overall the identified percentage removal efficiencies varied significantly specifically fe cr ni sb cu and al achieved 99 9 removal efficacy at 30 min whilst mn u and ni achieved 99 9 at 60 min on the other hand as toc and cod and reached equilibrium at 90 min 90 76 7 and 80 9 removal efficacy respectively the effect of contact time on the levels of ca mg and ph during the interaction of the mgo nps with the tww was also examined and results are shown in fig 2 specifically it was observed that the ph gradually increased from its initial value of 8 95 to a maximum of 10 5 at 90 min contact time this implies that a chemical reaction takes place at least up until the 90 min contact time this could be attributed to the dissolution of the produced mgo nps leading to the addition of hydroxyl groups in water and hence increasing the ph similarly mg was also noted to increase with an increase in contact time up until contact time 90 min where it reaches equilibrium this was also attributed to the dissolution of the produced mgo nps and the release of mg in the mixture ca is not a major contaminant in tww but it was measured here since it is typically found in the mgo nps parent material i e cryptocrystalline magnesite as shown in fig 2 very small concentrations are embedded into the cryptocrystalline magnesite matrix and this is the reason behind the small increase concentration of ca in the first examined contact time 5 min thereafter the ca concentration slowly decreases with increasing contact time and the corresponding increase in the ph level until it reaches equilibrium at 60 min contact time phreeqc predicted the possible formation of gypsum caso4 from the interaction of ca with the sulfate that is contained in the real tww whilst mg which existed as mg2 precipitated as brucite mg oh 2 other chemical species were removed as hydroxides amongst others furthermore phreeqc explicitly denoted precipitation adsorption co precipitation and complexation as key mechanisms governing the removal of contaminants summing up the aforementioned results suggest that the 90 min contact time appears to be the optimum duration for the removal of the chemical species contained in the real tww this value was then used to identify the optimum mgo nps dosage as described below 3 1 1 effect of magnesium oxide nanoparticles dosage the results on the effect of the mgo nps dosage on the removal of the main contaminants contained in the real tww are shown in fig 3 as mentioned above five different mgo nps dosages were examined i e 2 5 5 7 5 10 12 5 and 15 g as shown in fig 3 there was an increase in the percentage removals of the examined contaminants with increasing mgo nps dosages with each one reaching equilibrium in terms of percentage removal at different mgo np dosages specifically fe and u were practically removed at the first examined dosage 2 5 g while at the next dosage 5 g al and sb percentage removals plateaued 99 1 and 99 8 respectively at 7 5 g dosage the percentage removals for cr cu and ni plateaued 100 99 0 and 97 4 respectively and at 10 g dosage mn percentage removal plateaued 99 9 at the 12 5 as is practically removed 100 finally in the examined dosage range sulfate cod and toc do not reach equilibrium with the corresponding percentage removals being 30 0 73 3 and 55 0 the removal of cod and toc denotes the reduction of oxygen consuming substances in water furthermore there was a proportional relationship between toc and cod with the percentage removal efficacy being cod toc and this could be attributed to other substances that consume oxygen from the aqueous solution therefore at 7 5 g mgo nps dosage the majority of the contaminants have reached their maximum removal efficiency while the 10 g dosage optimizes the percentage removal of mn and further improves the percentage removals of sulfate cod and toc fig 3 higher dosages only slightly increase the efficiency of the system in the removal of sulfate cod and toc finally in fig 4 the results for ph ec and mg with increasing mgo nps dosages are shown specifically the ph was observed to steeply increase up to 7 5 g dosage and then slowly increase until the last examined dosage where it reaches its maximum 10 5 the addition of mgo nps lead to an increase in hydroxyl groups hence the increase in alkalinity which will lead to the precipitation of metals and minerals from the real tww on the other hand ec steeply decreases until the 5 g dosage and then steeply increase in dosages 7 5 g and thereafter trivial fluctuations are observed regarding the ca level this was observed to be higher than its initial value in all examined mgo nps dosages which suggest that a small amount of ca is present in the mgo nps parent material cryptocrystalline magnesite and this was released in the treated tww matrix however as the mgo nps dosage increase so does the ph and therefore ca begins to precipitate which is reflected on the lower ca levels of dosage 10 g and above compared to the dosage 7 5 g and below for mg there was a steep increase in its concentration in the first examined dosage 2 5 g then a small decrease 5 g dosage and a small increase in 7 5 g dosage thereafter trivial fluctuations were observed the phreeqc results suggest that mg forms brucite during the treatment process which then precipitates hence the decrease in mg concentration after the 7 5 g dosage this was further supported by the results of the characterization of the solid sample that are discussed below overall mgo nps dosages between 7 5 and 10 g appears to better fit the tww treatment process with the 10 g delivering additional benefits in terms of mn sulfate cod and toc removal therefore for the tww under study the 10 g per liter tww was taken as the optimum dosage 3 2 treatment of the real tannery wastewater at optimum conditions the results for the treatment of the real tww at optimum conditions i e 90 min contact time and 10 g l 1 dosage are discussed separately here the quality of the tww before and after the treatment with the produced mgo nps is shown in table 1 as shown in table 1 the interaction of the real tww with the produced mgo nps greatly improved the quality of this effluent specifically fe mn cr u sb were practically removed and this is primarily traced back to their scavenging from the mgo nps and or to the addition of alkalinity to the system since the ph raises an order of magnitude from about 9 to 10 since the ph scale is logarithmic cu also greatly reduces 99 56 but this is not eliminated from the system since to fully precipitate cu ph values as high as 12 are required 46 this was also highlighted by the phreeqc results where cu start to precipitate at ph 6 5 and fully precipitates at ph 12 5 ni fully precipitates at about ph 11 at that is the reason why it was not practically removed from system 97 4 removal on the other hand the mg and ca concentrations were observed to increase and particularly the former and this is tracked back to the dissolution of the mgo nps which also contains some ca see characterization of the solid samples below cod toc and sulfate were also reduced i e 69 3 70 9 and 21 4 respectively but not fully removed sulfate cod and toc attained partial removal of which the sulfate could be linked to possible formation of magnesium sulfate mgso4 aq complex in aqueous solution due to high solubility in aqueous environments and to a certain extent to gypsum due to the presence of ca overall the removal efficacies for the main contaminants of the real tww were from higher to lower percentage removal score fe u cr mn al sb cu ni toc cod s o 4 2 3 3 geochemical modelling results from phreeqc geochemical model highlighted the presence of different species for al fe mn cu ni cr u sb mg ca na and sulfate in tww these species can exist as cations anions and oxyanions whereas the metals can be complexed with the organic or inorganic ligands e g hydroxide sulfate and water molecules present in tww it is also likely that some of the metals can be present in more than one oxidation state however after their interaction with the produced mgo nps these species precipitated as hydroxides carbonates sulfides oxides and oxyhydrosulfates the main mechanisms governing the removal of these contaminants were precipitation and co precipitation while adsorption and co adsorption lead to the synthesis of new mineral phases which were also co precipitated specifically metals and radionuclides were precipitated as hydroxides sulfides and oxides mgo was also removed as hydroxide brucite mg oh 2 while ca formed other mineral phases such as gypsum and ca3 aso4 2 4h2o which were then precipitated overall results suggest the tww decontamination through a combination of precipitation adsorption and co adsorption they also imply that toxic and hazardous contaminants such as as and cu contained in the real tww matrix have been removed or greatly attenuated with the proposed mgo nps treatment technology nonetheless results also suggest that further treatment is required before the treated tww is released to the environment as is also highlighted in table 1 this was expected since in real world applications wastewater treatment is typically achieved using a treatment train and not a single treatment step here the real tww was greatly treated with the produced mgo nps and this imply only further polishing is required such as using lime softening for ni toc cod and particularly s o 4 2 removal the latter as gypsum before releasing this effluent with further treatment such as using filtration technology e g reverse osmosis water could also be reclaimed and used in different applications such as for industrial purposes or even for irrigation furthermore another possible avenue to improve the sustainability of this treatment technology could be the beneficiation of the produced sludge i e the recovery of the minerals that were synthesized from the interaction of the mgo nps with the metals that were contained in tww the recovery and reuse of the mg that is contained in the product sludge could also improve the sustainability of the process the above will be examined in future works of our group to corroborate the geochemical modelling results and further support the presented results for the treated tww the produced mgo nps and the solid material sludge that was generated during treatment reacted mgo nps thereafter were characterised and results are presented below specifically the chemical and mineralogical composition and the morphological properties of the produced and reacted mgo nps are comprehensively examined below 3 4 characterization of the solid samples to gain further insight on the fate and microstructural transformations of the contaminants that were embedded in tww post their interaction with the mgo nps different analytical pieces of equipment were employed for the characterization of both the mgo nps themselves and the reacted mgo nps generated sludge results are discussed in detail below 3 4 1 morphological characteristics the morphological properties of the produced and the reacted mgo nps were ascertained using hr fesem results are shown in fig 5 where it can be observed that the interaction of the produced mgo nps with the real tww lead to microstructural changes in the reacted mgo nps the observed microstructural changes confirm that a chemical reaction took place which altered the microstructural properties of the mgo nps post their interaction with the tww specifically the produced mgo nps fig 5a c e and g were observed to comprise spherical nanosheets lumped together regardless of the magnification that was employed 2 μm 1 μm 200 nm and 100 nm on the other hand the reacted mgo nps were observed to comprise honeycomb like structures interlinked together fig 5b d f and h the nanosheets were sandwiching in lamellar and leafy like structures arranged in a honeycomb fashion and this pattern was identified in all employed magnifications this could possibly suggest the formation of brucite as predicted by phreeqc since for example honeycomb structures for brucite have been reported by cao and chuan 47 brucite formation will further be highlighted by other analytical techniques which are discussed in the subsequent sections 3 4 2 elemental composition the surface elemental compositions of the produced and the reacted mgo nps were ascertained using the eds capabilities of the hr fesem instrument map sum spectrums results are shown in fig 6 as shown in fig 6a the produced mgo nps comprised notable levels of c o and mg along traces of ca in its matrix mg and o are directly traced back to mgo while c could be traced back to the coating material carbon that was used to create a conductive layer in the examined samples and thus enhance the resolution of the obtained results furthermore in fesem eds the background counts for c are high and therefore this peak could appear even in cases where c is not present as such the values of c can be disregarded since they do not refer to the nps themselves but to the experimental procedure after the produced mgo nps came into contact with the tww the reacted mgo nps were again found to comprised mg o and c which is disregarded from the analysis as major elements but in the case smaller amounts of ca na cl s and k were also identified fig 6b these lower concentration elements were embedded in the tww matrix therefore results confirm that mgo nps scavenge and remove contaminants from tww as was also highlighted in table 1 3 4 3 elemental mapping using hr fesem imaging the elemental mapping at the microstructural level for both the produced and the tww reacted mgo nps was ascertained using fesem eds and results are shown in fig 7 as shown in fig 7a the mgo nps comprised mg o and c o as major elements along with traces of ca in its matrices for the produced mgo nps the mg and o were evenly distributed and are traced back to mgo whereas the traces of ca are linked to the parent material cryptocrystalline magnesite as was mentioned above c originates from the coating material and not the mgo nps themselves and therefore this is not included in the analysis on the hand the reacted mgo nps fig 7b were found to comprise the same major elements i e mg o and c which is disregarded herein along with traces of ca na cl s and si apart from ca the remaining trace elements were not present in the produced mgo nps but they were present in tww suggesting that these were removed from tww and migrated to the reacted mgo nps therefore results suggest the high capacity of mgo nps in tww decontamination which has also been highlighted elsewhere using mgo nps that originate from different production processes 1 2 overall results confirm that mgo np scavenges contaminants from the real tww while the good transpose between the elements contained in tww and newly introduced elements in the reacted mgo nps confirms that a reaction took place that lead to their removal from tww 3 4 4 spot analysis to further corroborate the aforementioned results the chemical elements that were contained in the surfaces of both the produced and the reacted mgo nps were identified using the fesem images and the relevant eds spot analysis spectra results are shown in fig 8 as shown in fig 8a the mgo nps were observed to be predominated by mg o and c although the latter c was not available in some of the identified microstructures for the reasons mentioned above c can be omitted from the analysis furthermore traces of ca were also identified in the mgo nps matrix as highlighted in some of the eds spectra fig 8a this highlights that ca was embedded in small concentrations in the parent material cryptocrystalline magnesite and therefore is also found in the produced mgo mps on the other hand the reacted mgo nps denote the presence of mg and o c is omitted from the analysis as major elements while ca s na and si were identified as trace constituents s was present in all examined eds spectra hence suggesting an even distribution in the reacted mgo nps surface findings are similar to the ones reported in the water quality section table 1 and in the aforementioned results for the solid samples as such it can be confirmed that the mgo nps are scavenging and remove contaminants from real tww the presence of o in elevated concentration compared to the produced mgo nps implies the presence of hydroxides which include brucite mg oh 2 suggesting that mgo undergoes hydration when it reacts with tww 3 4 5 functional groups the ftir spectrum along with the identified functional groups and the respective wavenumber for both the produced and the reacted mgo nps is shown in fig 9 as shown in fig 9 there were practically no changes on the ftir spectrums of the produced and the reacted mgo nps therefore the identified functional groups and their respective wavenumbers are similar for both solid sample matrices the most prominent peaks were observed to appear at the wavenumbers 500 1000 1500 and 3700 cm 1 these peaks denote the stretching vibration and bending characteristics specifically the c o stretch group was present at 1000 cm 1 strong vibration of mg o bond was observed at 500 cm 1 while the bending duplex at 1500 cm 1 denotes the presence of co which highlight the presence of carbonate furthermore the absorbance peak at 3700 cm 1 relates to the o h stretching and highlights the presence of hydroxyl groups and water however in the case of the reacted mgo nps the peak is much higher which suggest the hydration of the reacted material this was expected since tww is an aqueous matrix the aforementioned results are in agreement with the body of knowledge in this regard 31 32 41 48 49 furthermore the mgo group traces back to the parent material cryptocrystalline magnesite while the carbonate bond confirms that the co was present in the produced mgo nps lastly the oh group hydroxyl group confirms or relates to the presence of water in the produced mgo nps e g some humidity absorbed in its surface and particularly in the reacted mgo nps where it denotes the presence of brucite and metal hydroxides in its matrix based on the phreeqc estimates and the ftir results the presence of mgco3 magnesite mgo periclase and mg oh 2 brucite in the produced and reacted mgo nps is implied 3 4 6 elemental composition using x ray fluorescence spectrometry the elemental compositions wt of the produced and reacted mgo nps were also identified and quantified using xrf spectrometry and the results are shown in table 2 as shown in table 2 the produced mgo nps contained high concentrations of mg along with low levels of ca and other traces elevated levels of mg are traced back to magnesite which is the parent material for the production of the mgo nps through calcination and vibratory ball milling the relatively low value for the loi could suggest that part of the surface of the produced mgo nps could have absorbed a small amount of humidity h2o and possibly some carbon co2 in the period spanning from its production up to its measurement on the other hand the reacted mgo nps were found to comprise lower levels of mg again as the major element along with traces of s ca and cr due to the low concentration of these contaminatns in tww their corresponding levels in the reacted mgo nps sludge is not notable and this was to be expected results confirm that the facile produced mgo nps effectively scavenge contaminants from tww finally the high loi confirms the presence of water in the reacted mgo nps and this could be linked to brucite and other hydrated minerals 3 4 7 mineralogical compositions using x ray diffraction spectroscopy the mineralogical compositions of the produced and the reacted mgo nps were estimated by means of xrd and the corresponding diffractograms are shown in fig 10 the xrd results revealed that the identified peaks at 2 theta degrees for the facile produced mgo nps correspond to periclase brucite quartz calcite anhydrite and magnesite after their interaction with tww the reacted mgo nps were observed to include similar mineral phases however the peaks for brucite were observed to be significantly higher whereas the peaks for periclase significantly lower in the reacted compared to the produced mgo nps this confirms that the mgo nps are highly reactive and that their interaction with the tww also lead to their hydration e g brucite formation peaks for hydrated sulfate anhydrite were also observed in the reacted mgo nps which had been also predicted by the phreeqc geochemical model and were also identified by the ftir and sem eds techniques overall the xrd results are in agreement with the results of the other analytical techniques employed herein including the ftir sem eds and icp oes as well as with the geochemical modelling estimates 4 insights into the mechanisms governing contaminants removal the mgo nps are partially soluble in water hence they will be dissolved thus also increasing the ph of the aqueous solution 41 furthermore the reaction of mgo with water could lead to the formation of brucite mg oh 2 henceforth an increase in ph will promote the precipitation of metals in tww whilst ions will be adsorbed onto soluble and non soluble fractions of the mgo nps the two mechanisms governing the attenuation of contaminants in the tww were predicted to be through co precipitation and co adsorption while contaminants were removed as hydroxides sulfides carbonates oxide and oxyhydrosulfates as emphasized in phreeqc geochemical model lastly the main mechanism is precipitation of the metals as hydroxides sulfides carbonates oxide and oxyhydrosulfates although adsorption could also play a role since the ph is influencing the removal of contaminants furthermore the non soluble component of mgo nps as well as the precipitating material could also aid in the removal of contaminants via adsorption 5 conclusions and recommendations magnesium oxide nanoparticles mgo nps were produced from cryptocrystalline magnesite following a thermo mechanoactivation process and then successfully employed for the treatment of real tannery wastewater tww specifically cryptocrystalline magnesite was pulverized using a vibratory ball miller i e mechanical processing and then was calcined i e thermally processing the calcined mgo was then pulverized to produce the very fine 32 μm mgo nps which were then used for the treatment of real tww the optimum treatment conditions were 90 min contact time mixing and 10 g mgo nps dosage per 1 l of real tww under ambient temperature and ph under these conditions the contaminants removal efficacy was from higher to lower score fe u cr mn al sb cu ni toc cod s o 4 2 chemical species attained 99 removal efficacy except for ni toc cod and sulfate which registered 97 4 70 9 69 3 and 21 4 removal efficiencies respectively the ph increased significantly from less than 9 to more than 10 suggesting that metals and minerals will precipitate microstructural transformations and the fate of chemical species post their removal from tww were also identified geochemical modelling phreeqc suggested that chemical species contained in tww are divalent trivalent oxyanions and multivalent and these will be attenuated through precipitation co precipitation adsorption and co adsorption and removed as hydroxides sulfides carbonates oxide and oxyhydrosulfates overall the facile produced mgo nps were found to be promising for the treatment of real tww however as with other wastewater treatment technologies a polishing step will be required for the tertiary treatment of the effluent in this regard a combination of precipitation and filtration might be promising since it provides a high degree of treatment thus making the reclamation of the treated water

8738,tannery wastewater tww is a toxic and hazardous effluent that causes great harm to receiving ecosystems if released untreated here magnesium oxide nanoparticles mgo nps synthesized from low cost and readily available magnesite were used for the treatment of real tww under batch laboratory conditions the optimum treatment conditions were 90 min contact time and 10 g mgo nps dosage per l of real tww under ambient ph and temperature results were underpinned by state of the art analytical techniques including icp oes xrd xrf and fib eds sem along with geochemical modelling phreeqc the removal efficiency for the main contaminants that are typically found in tww was from higher to lower score fe u cr mn al sb cu ni toc cod s o 4 2 the removal percentages for these contaminants were 99 aside from ni 97 toc 71 cod 69 and particularly s o 4 2 21 the underlying mechanism for contaminants removal is linked to the scavenging of metals by the mgo nps forming complexes in combination with alkalinity addition through mgo dissolution that lead to contaminants precipitation the phreeqc geochemical model confirmed the existence of divalent trivalent oxyanions and multivalent chemical species in mgo nps tww solution including complexes contaminants attenuation was achieved through precipitation co precipitation adsorption and co adsorption while these were removed as hydroxides sulfides carbonates oxide and oxyhydrosulfates overall results highlight the great potential of mgo nps for the sustainable management of real tww graphical abstract image 1 keywords tannery and textile wastewater activated mgo nanoparticles toxic heavy metals and salts metals precipitation thermal and mechano chemical activation ph redox equilibrium in c language phreeqc water reclamation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction consumerism along with rapid population growth have notably increased the demand for various resources including clothing and textiles as such the textile and tannery industries have emerged as important growth drivers in many countries but at the same time they are responsible for releasing a wide array of contaminants to receiving environments for example for leather and hides processing the tannery industry uses among others in organic and nitrogenous compounds metals and acids 1 2 therefore the respective effluents are rich in both organic and inorganic chemicals have high chemical oxygen demand cod and biochemical oxygen demand bod while salts suspended matter and organic carbon can also be present 2 specifically tannery wastewater tww is rich in dissolved salts cod bod organics dyes suspended solids and highly toxic chemical species such as fe al mn cr cu ni u sb and as along with base metals such as ca and mg 2 4 as such tww poses serious toxicological effects to living organisms upon exposure while the presence of color not only affect the aesthetic quality but also further exasperates its negative effects since among others it blocks the hunting ability of aquatic organisms and hinders photosynthesis 2 5 untreated tww can also affect agriculture and water and food security therefore different regulators such as the u s environmental protection agency epa 6 the world health organization who 7 and the south african department of water and sanitation dws 8 have specified strict discharge limits for treated wastewater matrices however currently very large volumes of tww are produced which have low biodegradability are highly mineralized and contain complex and toxic chemical constituents 3 therefore the sustainable management of tww remains a challenge and particularly in low and middle income countries lmic 3 4 different technologies have been proposed for tww treatment 3 which rely on different mechanisms including biological processes 9 oxidation 10 adsorption 11 filtration 12 precipitation 3 13 ion exchange 14 and bioremediation 15 each technology has its strengths and weaknesses adsorption is typically cost effective and easy to apply for water treatment even in remote areas 16 however it exhibits quick saturation and limited capacity in concentrated and multi component solutions such as tww whereas even though filtration and ion exchange exhibit high treatment efficiencies they are costly energy intensive and are associated with secondary pollution membranes generate brines while ion exchange resins regenerant wastes 2 17 18 on the other hand wetlands and biological treatment can be cost effective however large areas and long hydraulic retention times hrts are typically required while when used for the treatment of toxic and bio recalcitrant wastewaters they have limited efficacy in contaminants removal 19 moreover other technologies such as photocatalytic oxidation 20 21 and electrocoagulation 22 23 can be complex for real world applications and selective in terms of contaminants removal therefore research has also focused on new technologies that can effectively and sustainably treat tww with nanomaterials such as metal oxides having emerged as particularly promising in this regard due to their adsorption and photocatalytic properties 1 2 4 specifically fouda et al 2 assessed the catalytic degradation ability of hematite α fe2o3 and magnesium oxide mgo nanoparticles nps for textile and tannery wastewater treatment and large reductions in total suspended solids tss total dissolved solids tds metal content cr pb ni and cd and cod were observed oladipo et al 1 reported the application of bio derived mgo

treatment ph bod cod tds tss and electrical conductivity ec of tww 24 25 our research group also evaluated the use of mgo nps for the removal of boron 26 27 fluoride 28 arsenic 29 30 phosphate 31 33 and metals 34 36 other groups also demonstrated the successful application of mgo nps for water and wastewater treatment 2 24 25 34 37 40 therefore the body of knowledge suggest that mgo nps are promising for the treatment of tww however a study that comprehensively examines the removal of a wide range of contaminants from real tww when using mgo nps is still pending furthermore the efficiency of mgo nps derived from cryptocrystalline magnesite a low cost and readily available material for the treatment of real tww has not yet being comprehensively examined this chemical precipitation process is appealing to industries as compared to adsorption in light of the above this study seeks to expand the scope and comprehensively examine the efficiency of mgo nps produced through a facile synthesis process from cryptocrystalline magnesite for the treatment of real tww as such this is the first study in design and execution to explore the potential application of mgo nps synthesized from cryptocrystalline magnesite that examines its efficiency for the removal of a wide range of contaminants including fe u al mn cr sb ni as cu so4 cod and toc from real tww results were underpinned by state of the art analytical techniques and geochemical modelling phreeqc while the large and readily available cryptocrystalline magnesite reserves 41 can render this technology a new and sustainable avenue for the effective treatment of tww in south africa and further afield 2 materials and methods 2 1 magnesium oxide nanoparticles preparation the parent material of the mgo nps was south african cryptocrystalline magnesite which was procured from sterkfontein carbonates pty ltd south africa the procured magnesite was pulverized ball milled and passed through a 32 μm sieve to obtained homogenous cryptocrystalline magnesite nps the milled and sieved samples were then activated i e magnesite was converted to mgo through thermal processing calcination at 1100 c for 1 h 42 the produced mgo was then re milled and was again passed through the 32 μm sieve to obtain the desired mgo nps the mgo nps were then stored in a zip lock plastic bag until utilisation for the treatment of real tww 2 2 tannery wastewater collection and treatment the tww was collected from a tannery and textile industry located in brits north west south africa the wastewater was hand collected using 25 l wide mouth high density polyethylene hdpe bottles to ensure that the wastewater was free of suspended solids gravity filtration was employed using a macherey nagel filter paper mn 615 ø125mm thereafter the filtered samples were moved to the laboratory and treated with the produced mgo nps laboratory quality assurance and data quality control was ensured by carrying out all measurements in an iso iec 17025 2017 accredited laboratory i e at the magalies water services laboratory brits north west south africa 2 3 optimization studies to study the effect of the main operational parameters i e contact time and mgo nps dosage a wide range of values were examined for each parameter and the optimum conditions were identified ambient temperature i e room temperature range 18 22 c and ph were considered since in industrial treatment systems the ph and particularly the temperature are not typically controlled 2 3 1 effect of contact time the collected tww was first divided into 25 aliquots of 1 l each and then seven of those aliquots were transferred into separate laboratory beakers in each beaker 7 5 g of the produced mgo nps was added and different mixing durations contact time were examined specifically seven contact times ranging from as low as 5 min to as high as 180 min were examined i e 5 10 15 30 60 90 and 180 min mixing was achieved by means of an overhead stirrer pb 900 phipps bird programmable jar tester w illuminator the mixtures were allowed to settle and then each supernatant was passed through a macherey nagel filter paper mn 615 ø125mm gravity filtration the treated effluents and the collected solid samples were then characterized using state of the art techniques that are described below the optimum contact time was then used as a fixed parameter for the optimization of the mgo nps dosage 2 3 2 effect of magnesium oxide nanoparticles dosage a similar procedure was followed for the optimization of the mgo nps dosage i e the mgo nps mass per tww volume whereby 5 aliquots were transferred to five laboratory beakers and dosed with a different masses of mgo nps specifically the examined mgo nps dosages were 2 5 5 7 5 10 and 12 5 g per aloquot 1 l of real tww each dosed aliquot was then mixed using the identified optimum contact time again by means of an overhead stirrer pb 900 phipps bird programmable jar tester w illuminator then each mixture was allowed to settle and the supernatant was passed through a macherey nagel filter paper mn 615 ø125mm finally it should be noted that all experiments were carried out in triplicate and results are expressed as mean values in all cases very low standard deviations sdvs were observed ranging between 0 01 0 5 suggesting the high accuracy of the measured values 2 4 characterization 2 4 1 aqueous samples characterization the ec and ph of the raw and treated tww were measured using a portable meter hach hq40d metals metalloids anions and oxyanions were determined using the following instruments i inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes agilent s 5110 vertical dual view equipped with agilent s sps 4 high performance auto sampler ii thermo scientific s discreet gallery plus uv vis photo spectrometer and iii a total organic carbon analyzer shimadzu toc l cph detection limit of 0 1 mg l 1 ppm of c for the analysis of the raw and treated tww standard methods were followed as described elsewhere 43 2 4 2 solid samples characterization to support and complement the results of the aqueous samples raw and treated tww both the produced mgo nps as well as the reacted mgo nps i e the solid material sludge that was generated and precipitated after mgo nps came into contact with the real tww were also characterized for these solid samples the elemental and microstructural properties i e morphology elemental mapping elemental composition spot analysis and metal functional groups were estimated to this end a field emission scanning electron microscope fesem equipped with focused ion beam fib and an energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds zeiss auriga fib fesem eds was used to identify the elemental and microstructural properties while elemental compositions were also ascertained by means of x ray fluorescence xrf thermo scientific s arl perform x sequential xrf spectrometer equipped with uniquant software for standardless analysis the functional groups were determined using fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy perkinelmer s spectrum 100 ftir instrument equipped with a perkinelmer precisely universal attenuated total reflectance atr sampling accessory with a diamond crystal finally the crystalline phases were determined using x ray diffraction xrd malvern panalytical aeris edition equipped with a pixcel detector for quality assurance and control solid sample characterization was performed at south africa s national centre for nanostructured materials ncnsm council for scientific and industrial research csir 2 5 geochemical modeling to verify and complement the experimental results geochemical modelling by means of the ph redox equilibrium phreeqc computer program in c language was employed phreeqc is a robust geochemical model since it can perform a wide array of different aqueous geochemical calculations including speciation distribution of aqueous species and inverse geochemical calculations 44 45 here phreeqc was used to determine both the aqueous species and the possible mineral phases that are most likely to be generated from the interaction of the produced mgo nps with the tww specifically based on the composition of the real tww the saturation indices sis of the possible mineral phases were calculated for this reason the wateq4f chemical speciation program which includes databases for elemental speciation in water was used 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of contact time first the results for the effect of contact time mixing duration on tww treatment efficiency are presented as mentioned above seven mixing durations i e 5 10 15 30 60 90 and 180 min were examined and results are shown in fig 1 as shown in fig 1 there was an increase in the percentage removal of the contaminants contained in the real tww with increasing contact time until they reach equilibrium the different plateaus shown in fig 1 specifically each contaminant reaches its maximum percentage removal at a different contact time which traces back to the different reaction kinetics and thus highlight the importance of contact time for al fe and cr a rapid removal was observed within the first 20 min of the mgo nps tww interaction while mn was practically removed at the next examined contact time i e 30 min toc percentage removal exhibited a steep increase up until 30 min contact time and thereafter the percentage removal slowly increased and reached equilibrium at 90 min the percentage removal of cod also reached equilibrium at 90 min contact time overall the identified percentage removal efficiencies varied significantly specifically fe cr ni sb cu and al achieved 99 9 removal efficacy at 30 min whilst mn u and ni achieved 99 9 at 60 min on the other hand as toc and cod and reached equilibrium at 90 min 90 76 7 and 80 9 removal efficacy respectively the effect of contact time on the levels of ca mg and ph during the interaction of the mgo nps with the tww was also examined and results are shown in fig 2 specifically it was observed that the ph gradually increased from its initial value of 8 95 to a maximum of 10 5 at 90 min contact time this implies that a chemical reaction takes place at least up until the 90 min contact time this could be attributed to the dissolution of the produced mgo nps leading to the addition of hydroxyl groups in water and hence increasing the ph similarly mg was also noted to increase with an increase in contact time up until contact time 90 min where it reaches equilibrium this was also attributed to the dissolution of the produced mgo nps and the release of mg in the mixture ca is not a major contaminant in tww but it was measured here since it is typically found in the mgo nps parent material i e cryptocrystalline magnesite as shown in fig 2 very small concentrations are embedded into the cryptocrystalline magnesite matrix and this is the reason behind the small increase concentration of ca in the first examined contact time 5 min thereafter the ca concentration slowly decreases with increasing contact time and the corresponding increase in the ph level until it reaches equilibrium at 60 min contact time phreeqc predicted the possible formation of gypsum caso4 from the interaction of ca with the sulfate that is contained in the real tww whilst mg which existed as mg2 precipitated as brucite mg oh 2 other chemical species were removed as hydroxides amongst others furthermore phreeqc explicitly denoted precipitation adsorption co precipitation and complexation as key mechanisms governing the removal of contaminants summing up the aforementioned results suggest that the 90 min contact time appears to be the optimum duration for the removal of the chemical species contained in the real tww this value was then used to identify the optimum mgo nps dosage as described below 3 1 1 effect of magnesium oxide nanoparticles dosage the results on the effect of the mgo nps dosage on the removal of the main contaminants contained in the real tww are shown in fig 3 as mentioned above five different mgo nps dosages were examined i e 2 5 5 7 5 10 12 5 and 15 g as shown in fig 3 there was an increase in the percentage removals of the examined contaminants with increasing mgo nps dosages with each one reaching equilibrium in terms of percentage removal at different mgo np dosages specifically fe and u were practically removed at the first examined dosage 2 5 g while at the next dosage 5 g al and sb percentage removals plateaued 99 1 and 99 8 respectively at 7 5 g dosage the percentage removals for cr cu and ni plateaued 100 99 0 and 97 4 respectively and at 10 g dosage mn percentage removal plateaued 99 9 at the 12 5 as is practically removed 100 finally in the examined dosage range sulfate cod and toc do not reach equilibrium with the corresponding percentage removals being 30 0 73 3 and 55 0 the removal of cod and toc denotes the reduction of oxygen consuming substances in water furthermore there was a proportional relationship between toc and cod with the percentage removal efficacy being cod toc and this could be attributed to other substances that consume oxygen from the aqueous solution therefore at 7 5 g mgo nps dosage the majority of the contaminants have reached their maximum removal efficiency while the 10 g dosage optimizes the percentage removal of mn and further improves the percentage removals of sulfate cod and toc fig 3 higher dosages only slightly increase the efficiency of the system in the removal of sulfate cod and toc finally in fig 4 the results for ph ec and mg with increasing mgo nps dosages are shown specifically the ph was observed to steeply increase up to 7 5 g dosage and then slowly increase until the last examined dosage where it reaches its maximum 10 5 the addition of mgo nps lead to an increase in hydroxyl groups hence the increase in alkalinity which will lead to the precipitation of metals and minerals from the real tww on the other hand ec steeply decreases until the 5 g dosage and then steeply increase in dosages 7 5 g and thereafter trivial fluctuations are observed regarding the ca level this was observed to be higher than its initial value in all examined mgo nps dosages which suggest that a small amount of ca is present in the mgo nps parent material cryptocrystalline magnesite and this was released in the treated tww matrix however as the mgo nps dosage increase so does the ph and therefore ca begins to precipitate which is reflected on the lower ca levels of dosage 10 g and above compared to the dosage 7 5 g and below for mg there was a steep increase in its concentration in the first examined dosage 2 5 g then a small decrease 5 g dosage and a small increase in 7 5 g dosage thereafter trivial fluctuations were observed the phreeqc results suggest that mg forms brucite during the treatment process which then precipitates hence the decrease in mg concentration after the 7 5 g dosage this was further supported by the results of the characterization of the solid sample that are discussed below overall mgo nps dosages between 7 5 and 10 g appears to better fit the tww treatment process with the 10 g delivering additional benefits in terms of mn sulfate cod and toc removal therefore for the tww under study the 10 g per liter tww was taken as the optimum dosage 3 2 treatment of the real tannery wastewater at optimum conditions the results for the treatment of the real tww at optimum conditions i e 90 min contact time and 10 g l 1 dosage are discussed separately here the quality of the tww before and after the treatment with the produced mgo nps is shown in table 1 as shown in table 1 the interaction of the real tww with the produced mgo nps greatly improved the quality of this effluent specifically fe mn cr u sb were practically removed and this is primarily traced back to their scavenging from the mgo nps and or to the addition of alkalinity to the system since the ph raises an order of magnitude from about 9 to 10 since the ph scale is logarithmic cu also greatly reduces 99 56 but this is not eliminated from the system since to fully precipitate cu ph values as high as 12 are required 46 this was also highlighted by the phreeqc results where cu start to precipitate at ph 6 5 and fully precipitates at ph 12 5 ni fully precipitates at about ph 11 at that is the reason why it was not practically removed from system 97 4 removal on the other hand the mg and ca concentrations were observed to increase and particularly the former and this is tracked back to the dissolution of the mgo nps which also contains some ca see characterization of the solid samples below cod toc and sulfate were also reduced i e 69 3 70 9 and 21 4 respectively but not fully removed sulfate cod and toc attained partial removal of which the sulfate could be linked to possible formation of magnesium sulfate mgso4 aq complex in aqueous solution due to high solubility in aqueous environments and to a certain extent to gypsum due to the presence of ca overall the removal efficacies for the main contaminants of the real tww were from higher to lower percentage removal score fe u cr mn al sb cu ni toc cod s o 4 2 3 3 geochemical modelling results from phreeqc geochemical model highlighted the presence of different species for al fe mn cu ni cr u sb mg ca na and sulfate in tww these species can exist as cations anions and oxyanions whereas the metals can be complexed with the organic or inorganic ligands e g hydroxide sulfate and water molecules present in tww it is also likely that some of the metals can be present in more than one oxidation state however after their interaction with the produced mgo nps these species precipitated as hydroxides carbonates sulfides oxides and oxyhydrosulfates the main mechanisms governing the removal of these contaminants were precipitation and co precipitation while adsorption and co adsorption lead to the synthesis of new mineral phases which were also co precipitated specifically metals and radionuclides were precipitated as hydroxides sulfides and oxides mgo was also removed as hydroxide brucite mg oh 2 while ca formed other mineral phases such as gypsum and ca3 aso4 2 4h2o which were then precipitated overall results suggest the tww decontamination through a combination of precipitation adsorption and co adsorption they also imply that toxic and hazardous contaminants such as as and cu contained in the real tww matrix have been removed or greatly attenuated with the proposed mgo nps treatment technology nonetheless results also suggest that further treatment is required before the treated tww is released to the environment as is also highlighted in table 1 this was expected since in real world applications wastewater treatment is typically achieved using a treatment train and not a single treatment step here the real tww was greatly treated with the produced mgo nps and this imply only further polishing is required such as using lime softening for ni toc cod and particularly s o 4 2 removal the latter as gypsum before releasing this effluent with further treatment such as using filtration technology e g reverse osmosis water could also be reclaimed and used in different applications such as for industrial purposes or even for irrigation furthermore another possible avenue to improve the sustainability of this treatment technology could be the beneficiation of the produced sludge i e the recovery of the minerals that were synthesized from the interaction of the mgo nps with the metals that were contained in tww the recovery and reuse of the mg that is contained in the product sludge could also improve the sustainability of the process the above will be examined in future works of our group to corroborate the geochemical modelling results and further support the presented results for the treated tww the produced mgo nps and the solid material sludge that was generated during treatment reacted mgo nps thereafter were characterised and results are presented below specifically the chemical and mineralogical composition and the morphological properties of the produced and reacted mgo nps are comprehensively examined below 3 4 characterization of the solid samples to gain further insight on the fate and microstructural transformations of the contaminants that were embedded in tww post their interaction with the mgo nps different analytical pieces of equipment were employed for the characterization of both the mgo nps themselves and the reacted mgo nps generated sludge results are discussed in detail below 3 4 1 morphological characteristics the morphological properties of the produced and the reacted mgo nps were ascertained using hr fesem results are shown in fig 5 where it can be observed that the interaction of the produced mgo nps with the real tww lead to microstructural changes in the reacted mgo nps the observed microstructural changes confirm that a chemical reaction took place which altered the microstructural properties of the mgo nps post their interaction with the tww specifically the produced mgo nps fig 5a c e and g were observed to comprise spherical nanosheets lumped together regardless of the magnification that was employed 2 μm 1 μm 200 nm and 100 nm on the other hand the reacted mgo nps were observed to comprise honeycomb like structures interlinked together fig 5b d f and h the nanosheets were sandwiching in lamellar and leafy like structures arranged in a honeycomb fashion and this pattern was identified in all employed magnifications this could possibly suggest the formation of brucite as predicted by phreeqc since for example honeycomb structures for brucite have been reported by cao and chuan 47 brucite formation will further be highlighted by other analytical techniques which are discussed in the subsequent sections 3 4 2 elemental composition the surface elemental compositions of the produced and the reacted mgo nps were ascertained using the eds capabilities of the hr fesem instrument map sum spectrums results are shown in fig 6 as shown in fig 6a the produced mgo nps comprised notable levels of c o and mg along traces of ca in its matrix mg and o are directly traced back to mgo while c could be traced back to the coating material carbon that was used to create a conductive layer in the examined samples and thus enhance the resolution of the obtained results furthermore in fesem eds the background counts for c are high and therefore this peak could appear even in cases where c is not present as such the values of c can be disregarded since they do not refer to the nps themselves but to the experimental procedure after the produced mgo nps came into contact with the tww the reacted mgo nps were again found to comprised mg o and c which is disregarded from the analysis as major elements but in the case smaller amounts of ca na cl s and k were also identified fig 6b these lower concentration elements were embedded in the tww matrix therefore results confirm that mgo nps scavenge and remove contaminants from tww as was also highlighted in table 1 3 4 3 elemental mapping using hr fesem imaging the elemental mapping at the microstructural level for both the produced and the tww reacted mgo nps was ascertained using fesem eds and results are shown in fig 7 as shown in fig 7a the mgo nps comprised mg o and c o as major elements along with traces of ca in its matrices for the produced mgo nps the mg and o were evenly distributed and are traced back to mgo whereas the traces of ca are linked to the parent material cryptocrystalline magnesite as was mentioned above c originates from the coating material and not the mgo nps themselves and therefore this is not included in the analysis on the hand the reacted mgo nps fig 7b were found to comprise the same major elements i e mg o and c which is disregarded herein along with traces of ca na cl s and si apart from ca the remaining trace elements were not present in the produced mgo nps but they were present in tww suggesting that these were removed from tww and migrated to the reacted mgo nps therefore results suggest the high capacity of mgo nps in tww decontamination which has also been highlighted elsewhere using mgo nps that originate from different production processes 1 2 overall results confirm that mgo np scavenges contaminants from the real tww while the good transpose between the elements contained in tww and newly introduced elements in the reacted mgo nps confirms that a reaction took place that lead to their removal from tww 3 4 4 spot analysis to further corroborate the aforementioned results the chemical elements that were contained in the surfaces of both the produced and the reacted mgo nps were identified using the fesem images and the relevant eds spot analysis spectra results are shown in fig 8 as shown in fig 8a the mgo nps were observed to be predominated by mg o and c although the latter c was not available in some of the identified microstructures for the reasons mentioned above c can be omitted from the analysis furthermore traces of ca were also identified in the mgo nps matrix as highlighted in some of the eds spectra fig 8a this highlights that ca was embedded in small concentrations in the parent material cryptocrystalline magnesite and therefore is also found in the produced mgo mps on the other hand the reacted mgo nps denote the presence of mg and o c is omitted from the analysis as major elements while ca s na and si were identified as trace constituents s was present in all examined eds spectra hence suggesting an even distribution in the reacted mgo nps surface findings are similar to the ones reported in the water quality section table 1 and in the aforementioned results for the solid samples as such it can be confirmed that the mgo nps are scavenging and remove contaminants from real tww the presence of o in elevated concentration compared to the produced mgo nps implies the presence of hydroxides which include brucite mg oh 2 suggesting that mgo undergoes hydration when it reacts with tww 3 4 5 functional groups the ftir spectrum along with the identified functional groups and the respective wavenumber for both the produced and the reacted mgo nps is shown in fig 9 as shown in fig 9 there were practically no changes on the ftir spectrums of the produced and the reacted mgo nps therefore the identified functional groups and their respective wavenumbers are similar for both solid sample matrices the most prominent peaks were observed to appear at the wavenumbers 500 1000 1500 and 3700 cm 1 these peaks denote the stretching vibration and bending characteristics specifically the c o stretch group was present at 1000 cm 1 strong vibration of mg o bond was observed at 500 cm 1 while the bending duplex at 1500 cm 1 denotes the presence of co which highlight the presence of carbonate furthermore the absorbance peak at 3700 cm 1 relates to the o h stretching and highlights the presence of hydroxyl groups and water however in the case of the reacted mgo nps the peak is much higher which suggest the hydration of the reacted material this was expected since tww is an aqueous matrix the aforementioned results are in agreement with the body of knowledge in this regard 31 32 41 48 49 furthermore the mgo group traces back to the parent material cryptocrystalline magnesite while the carbonate bond confirms that the co was present in the produced mgo nps lastly the oh group hydroxyl group confirms or relates to the presence of water in the produced mgo nps e g some humidity absorbed in its surface and particularly in the reacted mgo nps where it denotes the presence of brucite and metal hydroxides in its matrix based on the phreeqc estimates and the ftir results the presence of mgco3 magnesite mgo periclase and mg oh 2 brucite in the produced and reacted mgo nps is implied 3 4 6 elemental composition using x ray fluorescence spectrometry the elemental compositions wt of the produced and reacted mgo nps were also identified and quantified using xrf spectrometry and the results are shown in table 2 as shown in table 2 the produced mgo nps contained high concentrations of mg along with low levels of ca and other traces elevated levels of mg are traced back to magnesite which is the parent material for the production of the mgo nps through calcination and vibratory ball milling the relatively low value for the loi could suggest that part of the surface of the produced mgo nps could have absorbed a small amount of humidity h2o and possibly some carbon co2 in the period spanning from its production up to its measurement on the other hand the reacted mgo nps were found to comprise lower levels of mg again as the major element along with traces of s ca and cr due to the low concentration of these contaminatns in tww their corresponding levels in the reacted mgo nps sludge is not notable and this was to be expected results confirm that the facile produced mgo nps effectively scavenge contaminants from tww finally the high loi confirms the presence of water in the reacted mgo nps and this could be linked to brucite and other hydrated minerals 3 4 7 mineralogical compositions using x ray diffraction spectroscopy the mineralogical compositions of the produced and the reacted mgo nps were estimated by means of xrd and the corresponding diffractograms are shown in fig 10 the xrd results revealed that the identified peaks at 2 theta degrees for the facile produced mgo nps correspond to periclase brucite quartz calcite anhydrite and magnesite after their interaction with tww the reacted mgo nps were observed to include similar mineral phases however the peaks for brucite were observed to be significantly higher whereas the peaks for periclase significantly lower in the reacted compared to the produced mgo nps this confirms that the mgo nps are highly reactive and that their interaction with the tww also lead to their hydration e g brucite formation peaks for hydrated sulfate anhydrite were also observed in the reacted mgo nps which had been also predicted by the phreeqc geochemical model and were also identified by the ftir and sem eds techniques overall the xrd results are in agreement with the results of the other analytical techniques employed herein including the ftir sem eds and icp oes as well as with the geochemical modelling estimates 4 insights into the mechanisms governing contaminants removal the mgo nps are partially soluble in water hence they will be dissolved thus also increasing the ph of the aqueous solution 41 furthermore the reaction of mgo with water could lead to the formation of brucite mg oh 2 henceforth an increase in ph will promote the precipitation of metals in tww whilst ions will be adsorbed onto soluble and non soluble fractions of the mgo nps the two mechanisms governing the attenuation of contaminants in the tww were predicted to be through co precipitation and co adsorption while contaminants were removed as hydroxides sulfides carbonates oxide and oxyhydrosulfates as emphasized in phreeqc geochemical model lastly the main mechanism is precipitation of the metals as hydroxides sulfides carbonates oxide and oxyhydrosulfates although adsorption could also play a role since the ph is influencing the removal of contaminants furthermore the non soluble component of mgo nps as well as the precipitating material could also aid in the removal of contaminants via adsorption 5 conclusions and recommendations magnesium oxide nanoparticles mgo nps were produced from cryptocrystalline magnesite following a thermo mechanoactivation process and then successfully employed for the treatment of real tannery wastewater tww specifically cryptocrystalline magnesite was pulverized using a vibratory ball miller i e mechanical processing and then was calcined i e thermally processing the calcined mgo was then pulverized to produce the very fine 32 μm mgo nps which were then used for the treatment of real tww the optimum treatment conditions were 90 min contact time mixing and 10 g mgo nps dosage per 1 l of real tww under ambient temperature and ph under these conditions the contaminants removal efficacy was from higher to lower score fe u cr mn al sb cu ni toc cod s o 4 2 chemical species attained 99 removal efficacy except for ni toc cod and sulfate which registered 97 4 70 9 69 3 and 21 4 removal efficiencies respectively the ph increased significantly from less than 9 to more than 10 suggesting that metals and minerals will precipitate microstructural transformations and the fate of chemical species post their removal from tww were also identified geochemical modelling phreeqc suggested that chemical species contained in tww are divalent trivalent oxyanions and multivalent and these will be attenuated through precipitation co precipitation adsorption and co adsorption and removed as hydroxides sulfides carbonates oxide and oxyhydrosulfates overall the facile produced mgo nps were found to be promising for the treatment of real tww however as with other wastewater treatment technologies a polishing step will be required for the tertiary treatment of the effluent in this regard a combination of precipitation and filtration might be promising since it provides a high degree of treatment thus making the reclamation of the treated water possible this is of major importance in water scarce countries such as south africa credit author statement v masindi conceptualization validation formal analysis investigation resources data curation

8739,small hydropower plants are one of the most important renewable energy sources that do not degrade and consume natural resource the paper presents a case study of an already operating small hydropower plant shp and a potential increase in its energy production by raising the damming level three variants were defined and subjected to detailed analysing the analyses used the fuzzy ahp methodology fahp which allowed for identifying the variant that has the best chance of being implemented in the context of administrative legal and social realities of the country where an shp is located the adopted solution will increase electricity production by 108 78 mwh annually while reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 86000 kg co2 the described methodology is of general use and can be

vlšekriterijumsko kompromisno rangiranje wpm weighted product method 1 introduction in present times high greenhouse gas emissions have caused major changes to the atmosphere 1 therefore it is pivotal to use sustainable energy resources to the maximum extent possible this is particularly important in the areas where there are no environmental economic or social opportunities to produce energy by conventional means characterised by exhaustiveness and limitation here renewable sources are an alternative solution the natural reservoirs of which do not diminish during energy production or are rebuilt very quickly without the risk of a deficit occurrence these include wind energy solar radiation energy geothermal energy hydropower wave energy ocean current and tidal energy energy from biomass biogas and bioliquids the development of technology allows for introducing solutions that will ensure constant access to energy for all consumers renewable energy sources res are available everywhere anywhere on the surface of the globe also above and below it only the sun alone provides annually to earth 10 000 times more energy than the consumption of man made energy at the same time therefore the use of the latest res technologies has become one of the pro developmental objectives for many countries around the world 2 at present their development is particularly important as we experience climate change and there is a risk of failure to provide energy security electricity from renewable energy sources accounts for 33 of the total installed capacity in the world and is gaining global recognition as a tool to mitigate climate change 3 accordingly national energy policies should be oriented towards the use and exploration of renewable resources on a large scale the construction of small hydropower plants is booming around the world 4 many governments are subsidizing the construction of small hydropower plants because they are perceived as having less negative impact on the environment than large hydropower plants 5 nowadays there is a noticeable trend consisting in a significant increase in support for the broad development of small hydropower plants shps the global synthesis shows that 82 891 shps are in operation or under construction 11 shps per large hydropower plant and it is estimated that this number would triple if all potential capacity was used 5 the development of shp has been driven by substantial political 6 10 economic and environmental stimuli hydroelectric power plants are one of the key sources of renewable energy 11 14 globally they satisfy nearly 17 of the world s electricity demand international hydropower association 2018 the natural flow regime plays a fundamental role in the process of obtaining energy from hydropower plants but it is also the main driving force of various biological processes and it guarantees long term ecological vitality 15 however inadequate exploitation of water resources can profoundly undermine the integrity of fluvial ecosystems 16 therefore the location of small hydropower plants should be carefully examined and chosen with the use of i e geographic information system gis studies in this area were conducted by ref 17 the right approach to choosing the location of shps within the river network can reduce their negative impact on the biodiversity of existing fauna and flora hydropower as a renewable energy source has got numerous advantages including low operating and maintenance costs high efficiency approx 60 80 and long service life of installed devices 18 as well as low requirements for the value of hydraulic head the above is confirmed by refs 3 19 on the other hand there are some disadvantages to hydropower systems i e variability of the water flow rate throughout the year water availability high initial costs and a long time of construction according to ref 20 hydropower plants producing electricity from natural sources do not cause any pollution or damage to the environment however hydropower systems can alter natural flow regimes and deteriorate the condition of river ecosystems at various trophic levels 21 the most common environmental impacts observed are changes in the flow regime less water in the downstream loss of watercourse capacity injuries to fish habitat degradation and deterioration of the species diversity of fish and macroinvertebrates shps work and the choice of their location is affected by numerous different quantitative and qualitative factors taking the right decisions requires the use of methods that optimise decisions based on various criteria the methods of multi criteria optimisation mcdm multi criteria decision making and mcda multi criteria decision analysis allow for the comparison of decision variants and the selection of optimal solutions although they cover defined often contradictory criteria the mcda methods have some undoubted advantages they ease to solve problems described by various measures rank qualitative and quantitative factors allow for the participation of interested persons in the decision making process include the community at every stage of the analysis starting from defining options for solutions selecting criteria and preferences up to indicating the final solution the disadvantages of mcda include the risk of subjectivity in assigning weights by experts to individual criteria which in turn may lead to obtaining different solutions proposed by different people depending on the priorities they indicate 22 23 among the mcda methods one of the most frequently used is ahp analytic hierarchy process 24 25 widely used in many optimisations it has also found application in the field associated with hydraulic engineering i e flood risk planning assessment and management 26 33 or the selection of the location of small hydropower plants shps 34 36 and their management 37 38 is one of the most appropriate methods for flood risk assessment 39 also with the use of gis tools gis mcda to build flood hazard maps 40 43 or to select the location of dams 17 particularly in combination with other methods 44 in the method the decision problem is divided into criteria reflecting its important aspects often it also introduces the division into main criteria and sub criteria within individual criteria which significantly facilitates the development of a pairwise comparison matrix defining the preferences of decision makers and determining the weighting of criteria in particular if there are many of them and creating one matrix of comparisons would be very troublesome since subjective assessments assigned to particular criteria by experts may be imprecise an alternative approach can be the application of the fuzzy set theory and the use of fuzzy ahp fahp in analyses 45 48 dissimilarly to ahp instead of clearly defined discrete values the fahp method shows some fuzzification of values through the use of fuzzy numbers which allows for including the uncertainty of decision makers and fuzzy numbers are used to represent human judgments more realistically the literature offers many approaches to the fuzzification of ahp methods 46 49 51 which differ among others in various fuzziness functions the most commonly used fuzziness functions are triangular nevertheless trapezoidal 52 or spherical ones 53 are also applied making the right decision on how to plan and or manage technical infrastructure facilities including hydrotechnical objects requires analysing all known criteria related to the problem in many cases a large number of criteria that need to be taken into account their considerably different nature quantitative qualitative as well as the necessity to combine and reconcile all conflicting criteria hinder the process of decision making therefore this process should be based on one of the many available methods i e mcda mcdm multiple criteria decision analysis multiple criteria decision making an extensive list of methods and popular software used in the analysis of sustainable development of renewable energy can be found in the work by kumar 22 in addition the fahp method was used to assess the potential of alternative renewable energy sources for electricity production selection of the optimal location of facilities producing energy from such sources or the capability of changing the work of these objects karakaş and yildiran 54 used a modified fahp method to evaluate five alternatives of renewable energy production in turkey i e hydropower wind solar biomass and geothermal energy sources the purpose of their study was to assess the most suitable renewable energy alternative in order to determine the ratings of each renewable energy alternative four main criteria c1 technical c2 economic c3 environmental and c4 social and eight sub criteria were adopted to assess five alternative renewable energy sources the results indicate that experts considered the environmental criterion as more important than others moreover the technical criterion was identified as the second most important according to the results solar energy was considered the best alternative and wind energy the second best alternative for turkey the researchers also pointed out that while the order of these alternatives kept changing wind power and solar power were found to be the most suitable renewable energy alternatives for turkey in most studies similarly ertaya et al 55 used macbeth and ahp based multicriteria methods for the evaluation of renewable energy alternatives under fuzziness they used 4 main criteria and 15 sub criteria in the assessment the researchers identified potential renewable energy alternatives for turkey as solar wind hydro and geothermal also karatop et al 56 assessed the risks of renewable energy alternatives using fuzzy failure mode and effect analysis fuzzy ahp edas fuzzy fmea finally the best alternatives were identified by comparing the assessment results in the analyses the researchers determined how to make optimal investment decisions in the renewable energy sector in turkey based on the growing global importance of renewable energy they proposed a model that enables more credible renewable energy investment decisions by combining both prioritization and risk analysis the fuzzy analytical hierarchy process fuzzy ahp and the evaluation based on distance from average solution edas methods were used to prioritize renewable energy alternatives and the fuzzy failure mode and effect analysis fmea method was applied to identify risks of renewable energy alternatives the researchers indicated that turkey should focus on hydro and wind power in its renewable energy investments yucesan and kahraman 57 conducted risk assessment for hydropower plants using the pythagorean fuzzy analytical hierarchy process pfahp to make the process of risk assessment more efficient the analyses used the opinion of five hydropower plant decision makers the team of experts identified and demonstrated twenty hazards and their effects that may occur during the operation of hydropower facilities this enabled the identification of major considerable threats c19 entering the generator cell without informing the control operator was considered by decision makers as the biggest risk c14 both malfunction of the switches and safety valves of compressed air and oil tanks risk of explosion resulting in excessive pressure increase was recognized by decision makers as the second greatest threat c17 rise of turbine pit water due to turbine pit seal failure was determined by decision makers as the third most important hazard preventive actions were proposed in order to avoid the hazards considered as the most threatening ram and chandna 58 used fahp to evaluate the sensitivity of the hydroelectric system taking the human failure into consideration using fuzzy analytic hierarchy process approach six different failure rates were taken into consideration the fuzzy approach incorporated all the vagueness and uncertainty existing in the power system due to different failure and repair rates pavlović et al 59 used fahp to assess the potential of renewable energy sources that could be used in the serbian energy sector the four most potential ress for electricity generation in serbia biomass hydro solar and wind were assessed four main criteria were adopted economic technical environmental and socio political the researchers based on the fahp analysis indicated that hydropower and biomass have the highest potential among available renewable energy sources the new fuzzy integrated delphi fahp fpromethee methodology was applied by seddiki and bennadji 60 with the objective to select the best renewable energy alternatives in a residential building in algeria the first step using the delphi method involved selecting an initial set of alternative renewable energy sources for electricity generation and an initial set of criteria economic environmental social etc then using fahp criteria weights were developed taking into account the uncertainty of expert assessments the global ranking was created using fpromethee fuzzy preference ranking organization method for enrichment evaluation wang et al 61 proposed a hybrid method by applying the fuzzy ahp and topsis methods together to select the most appropriate location for a wind farm to be built in vietnam sensitivity analysis is an important element of decision models also for the fahp method 62 63 although it is not always performed primarily due to the complexity of some procedures the required computation time and limited resources available for this purpose 64 it enables the estimation of uncertainty in fuzzy and multi criteria analyses the results obtained from the sensitivity analysis can be used to answer what if questions the final ranking of alternatives may largely depend on the weights adopted for individual criteria and the subjective assessment of importance of criteria in pairwise comparison matrices the sensitivity analysis provides information on changes in the rankings of variants depending on changes in the parameters of the analysed decision model and provides information on the stability of the method 65 66 there are several approaches to the sensitivity analysis of fahp in the literature such an analysis can be conducted by modifying the weights of criteria 27 63 67 69 the oat one at a time approach modifies the weight of only one criterion after which the decision model is re analysed and a new ranking is created a probabilistic approach i e using the monte carlo method 70 72 assumes that all criteria weights are generated completely randomly to discover how the ranking of alternatives changes under any conditions 73 an alternative approach is to modify the fuzzification factor δ when constructing triangular fuzzy numbers tfns 62 64 74 75 the initial value of the coefficient is usually taken as δ 1 the aim of the study is to analyse the possibility of changing the damming level of the existing small hydropower plant on the noteć river in rosko north western poland taking into account economic administrative technical environmental legal and social factors using the mcdm multi criteria optimisation method the variant with parameters with the greatest chance of implementation was selected the data necessary to support the decision making process was obtained from the archives of the shp owner in particular information on energy production in 2020 hydraulic analyses were also performed based on a numerical model of transient flows in order to quantify the impact of changing the damming level on the river section above the barrage the remaining data for the mcdm method was determined based on the data found in the literature as well as applicable ordinances and legal regulations due to the diversity of data the decision making process of selecting the most favourable variant is not simple and may be burdened with high uncertainty hence the need to conduct sensitivity analyses of the methods applied it is worth emphasising that both the scientific and engineering literature lack information on the practical use of advanced methods of decision support in the process of changing the operating conditions of small hydrotechnical facilities analyses indicating whether the adopted scheme of changing shp operating parameters can be implemented are not carried out which often leads to generating unnecessary costs and workload for facility operators a factor affecting the decision making process and consequently the final ranking may be that decision makers and experts find difficulty in correctly describing their own preferences when there are problems with developing a pairwise comparison matrix for instance difficulties with determining clear obviously defined preference values by experts or decision makers the theory of fuzzy sets and fuzzy ahp 76 can be successfully applied making evaluation results more reasonable and comprehensive 77 the work also analysed the stability of the obtained ranking by modifying the weights for the group of criteria g1 g4 the methodology presented in the work fills this gap and shows the effectiveness of its application even in the case of small hydrotechnical facilities 2 materials and methods the usefulness of decision models depends on a possibly credible set of input data based on objective quantitative and qualitative analyses for hydropower plants these analyses concern hydraulic hydrological operational economic ecological legal and social aspects such a variety of areas causes that input data for models are not homogeneous and in many situations they are qualitative and subjective the use of mcdm methods is associated with accepting the susceptibility of the final results to non objective qualitative measures on the other hand it is difficult to find objective methods preferably quantitative in all required areas which can be verified and subject to validation procedures for the discussed shp rosko four main criteria were adopted and analysed with fuzzy ahp fahp they were assigned detailed sub criteria as illustrated in fig 1 the economic criterion is objective quantitative and relatively easy to determine for individual variants the owner of the hydropower plant has and made available the data necessary to determine individual cost items the legal criterion is qualitative due to its high uncertainty as to the reactions of officials and the local community in many cases issuing administrative documentation depends on the competence of the official to whom the application is submitted the existing legal regulations may also change which may extend and prolong the decision making process and sometimes even cancel it unfortunately for many countries these elements are very uncertain in equal measure in economically well developed regions the technical criteria are quantitative and objective moreover they can influence the qualitative criteria in this case legal social and environmental this in particular concerns administrative arrangements the applicant demonstrating objectively and quantitatively the impact of the change on hydrotechnical facilities and a given section of the river can explain the concerns of people who administer and manage these facilities also the local community and environmental organisations should obtain objective and quantitative information that will help them understand the concept of change in the discussed example the socio environmental criteria are mixed some of them can be estimated quantitatively reduction of co2 emissions impact on tourism and water transport and others qualitatively in the further part of the work two quantitative analyses are discussed in detail which allowed for a good estimation of parameters for the mcdm method used these are the hydraulic analysis of the impact of the damming level on the section of the noteć river above the damming barrage and the analysis of the increase in electricity production 2 1 general information on shp rosko shp rosko fig 2 is the largest installation in poland to generate renewable energy using archimedes screw spiral turbines the installation consists of 6 spiral turbine sets 60

water from the power plant is discharged by a 550 m long fully reconstructed power channel the estimated annual production of renewable energy is approx 2000 mwh the expected reduction of co2 emissions will amount to approx 2531 t year the amount of primary energy saved will amount to approx 21 627 06 gj year the hydropower plant was put into operation on 15 06 2014 commence of the technological start up the use permit was obtained on 18 07 2014 by the decision of the president of the energy regulatory office pol ure of 19 09 2014 it was granted a license to produce electricity shp rosko is located within the hydro node of the noteć river in rosko which consists of a damming weir and a single chamber lock both buildings are concrete objects the damming weir has the following technical parameters hydraulic head 1 41 m number of spans 3 gap 25 92 m threshold ordinate 33 67 m a s l kr normal water level 36 66 m a s l kr maximum water level 36 97 m a s l kr design flow q m q2 is 139 2 m3s 1 2 2 hydraulic analysis of the impact of the damming level on the section of the noteć river above the damming barrage an important element that might be decisive in gaining the approval from the authorities managing the river and hydrotechnical facilities is the performance of reliable analyses of the impact of changing the damming level on the section of the river above the water barrage this applies in particular to the impact on the damming level above mikołajewo possibility of affecting the facilities draining water from the adjacent areas increased pressure on the embankments change in the depth for water transport and change in the flow velocity the owner of the power plant commissioned the authors of the study to perform such analyses using a numerical flow model the hydraulic analysis included the following stages 1 bathymetric surveys of the noteć section above the rosko damming barrage 12 bathymetric sections 2 measurement of flows and water table ordinates for different levels of damming 3 processing bathymetric data 4 preparing a data set for a numerical hydrodynamic model 5 making calibration and model verification calculations 6 analysis of the impact of change in the damming level based on the numerical flow model as mentioned earlier the field research included measurements of water table ordinates flow rates and bathymetry of cross sections measurements of water table ordinates were made with the use of gps rtk sokkia 11 geodetic equipment the measurements were used for calibrating a computational model 28 measurements of water table ordinates were carried out in two series for different damming levels flow measurements were made with the adcp streampro probe 78 which also enabled the acquisition of information on the bathymetry of the watercourse bottom data from the adcp probe was imported into the winriver ii data processing postprocessor the application allows for determining the flow value as well as export bathymetry data as text files fig 3 is a screenshot of the winriver ii application with windows showing a summary of flow measurements direction of the device movement along with the water flow direction and the velocity distribution in the measurement section with depth and distance from the riverbank fig 4 shows the bathymetry for the cross section at km 154 068 carried out based on the measurements made with the streampro adcp probe this cross section and other measurement cross sections were used to generate data for the numerical flow model 2 3 the flow model on the noteć river section from km 148 840 to km 154 068 the one dimensional transient flow analysis and forecasting system spruner 79 was used to analyse the flow conditions of the noteć river in the section above shp rosko it can model the operation of the system of polders embankment overflows water barrages and widespread floodplain valleys to describe the transient flow transformation it uses the well known and

2 is possible provided that the initial boundary problem is correctly formulated due to the non linear nature of the equations their solutions for natural channels can only be searched for by numerical methods most of the currently existing transient flow models based on saint venant equations including the spruner system use the finite difference method and the implicit differential scheme to discretize flow equations 80 2 4 calculation model the created calculation model covered a 5268 m long section of the noteć river from km 148 840 cross section located directly above the weir of the rosko dam to km 154 068 cross section located below the dam in mikołajewo the model contains 33 cross sections connected in 32 calculation segments the location of these cross sections along with their mileage is shown in fig 2 the model used bathymetric sections implemented during the field research 12 sections the measured bathymetric cross sections were used to generate intermediate cross sections which supplemented the data on the geometry of the flow area the level hydrograph in the lower riverside cross section 148 84 and the flow hydrograph in the upper riverside cross section 154 068 were assumed as the boundary conditions calibration was performed for the data on the flows and levels as of 30 04 2018 the measured flow in the cross section above the rosko shp was 34 95 m3s 1 and in the cross section below the barrage at km 154 068 equalled to 35 1 m3s 1 a small difference in the flow measurements indicates the existence of steady motion conditions in this period very small flow fluctuation over time 14 ordinate measurements mentioned above were made for this flow the ordinate measured in the riverside cross section at 148 840 was the lower boundary condition value hydrograph of levels constant over time the upper boundary condition was set as a constant flow hydrograph 35 m3s 1 the hydrographs of boundary conditions that are constant over time force the computational model based on the equations of transient motion to fulfil the criterion of steady motion the measurement data and the results from the numerical model are presented in table 1 the accuracy of altitude measurements with the rtk gps apparatus is 0 01 m hence the process of calibration of the roughness coefficients for individual sections was considered completed when the differences between the measured and calculated levels were less than 1 cm the average difference between the measured and calculated values adopted as a metric for fitting the model to the object was 0 0041 m the values of roughness coefficients according to manning s formula varied from 0 022 to 0 024 the measurement was carried out in the spring before the beginning of the activation of bottom and bank vegetation hence it should be assumed that in the summer and autumn the resistance to motion may be even greater the thesis was confirmed by flow measurements made in the autumn on 16 09 2017 and 15 11 2017 flow measurements were made for two different damming 70 and 86 m3s 1 respectively for two ordinates of 36 67 and 36 78 m a s l roughness coefficients for the summer and autumn periods ranged from 0 0253 to 0 0276 the proposed calibrated model for two sets of roughness coefficients for spring and for summer autumn was additionally verified on the basis of field measurements verification measurements were made on october 17 2018 summer autumn period and april 5 2019 spring period and also showed an accuracy of 1 cm therefore the model was considered credible the calibrated numerical model was used to carry out simulations determining the effect of damming at the rosko barrage on the water levels in the noteć river within km 148 840 and 154 068 it has been shown that this impact will decrease primarily with an increasing flow also an increase in flow resistances reduces the impact of the damming change in the section upstream of the rosko hydropower plant table 2 and fig 5 show the change in water levels in section 154 068 located below the mikołajewo damming barrage depending on the value of the flow in the spring and summer autumn period for the damming increment equal to 0 1 m calculations confirmed that the change in the damming level at the rosko barrage will affect the water levels in the downstream of the mikołajewo barrage the same analyses were performed for the damming level increase by 0 2 m and 0 3 m which allowed for determining the rating scales for fuzzy ahp a change by 0 1 and 0 2 m will not disturb the drainage of water from the adjacent areas will increase the transit depth for water transport and will reduce the velocity of water flow when the damming level changes by 0 3 m it affects the hydrotechnical structures that drain water and increases the pressure on the embankments 2 5 calculation of the annual increase in electricity production the purpose of raising the damming level is of course to increase the annual energy production and thus generate additional income the power of a hydropower plant in kilowatts is calculated according to the generally known formula 3 n n 9 81 h q where n total efficiency coefficient h hydraulic head m q flow rate m3s 1 therefore the output of a hydropower plant increases linearly with an increase in the value of h during the operation of such a plant its operator can maintain the assumed damming level but they have no or a very limited influence on the flow rate the efficiency of turbines also does not have a constant value and it changes with the change in flow rates and hydraulic heads in order to estimate the value of annual production increase the information of the hydropower plant owner on energy production in 2020 was used the set of data that was obtained contained the information on the values of daily energy production flow rate and hydraulic head based on the data the actual efficiencies n were calculated from formula 3 the average efficiency coefficient for the entire period was 0 563 and the standard deviation was equal to 0 108 by determining the efficiency coefficient for each day the daily increase in production was calculated which would be the result of increasing the damming level by 0 1 0 2 0 3 m respectively fig 6 shows the actual daily energy production in 2020 and the value estimated with an increase in the damming level by 0 2 m the total actual annual electricity production of shp rosko was 1842 82 mwh the estimated values of energy production for the damming level of 0 1 0 2 and 0 3 m are 1951 60 2060 38 and 2169 16 mwh respectively annual production increase for individual damming levels would be then equal to 108 78 217 56 and 326 34 mwh respectively 2 6 impact of damming level increase on greenhouse gas emissions additional production of energy from renewable sources clearly reduces greenhouse gas emissions poland is a country where electricity production is still based on conventional sources mainly hard coal and lignite it is assumed 81 that in poland the production of 1 mwh of electricity from conventional sources emits 850 kg co2 increasing the damming level by 3 values mentioned above will reduce co2 emissions by 86000 178000 and 270000 kg respectively 2 7 legal and social situation as mentioned earlier shp rosko is located within the barrage consisting of a damming weir and a lock the owner of these facilities in accordance with the water law in force in poland is the state institution responsible for their operation the owner of the hydropower plant has acquired the consent of the manager of the damming facility for the construction and operation of the power plant for the damming level defined in the so called water permit safe from the point of view of the weir and the lock s operation both the weir and the lock are objects that were built over 100 years ago they are subject to very strict regulations regarding their operation and the manager is very reluctant to any changes damming level increase will have a positive effect on increasing retention capacity and will improve navigation conditions in the section above the hydropower plant however the disadvantageous effect may be a reduction in the velocity of flowing water and greater pressure on the overgrowth of the riverbed and consequently an increase in the maintenance costs of this section of the river another important aspect is the social pressure exerted by local farmers whose farmland is in the vicinity of the embankments of the river section affected by the rosko dam these people closely observe all activities related to the operation of hydrotechnical facilities and try to prove often unfoundedly their negative impact on the land they use also they are supported by environmental organisations which on the one hand sympathise with increasing the energy production from renewable energy sources but on the other hand are very reluctant to accept any changes that may affect the ecosystem 2 8 assumptions for fuzzy ahp the analyses adopted 13 criteria table 3 which were additionally divided into four main criteria economic g1 legal g2 technical g3 socio environmental g4 appropriate sub criteria were assigned to each of the designated groups creating a multi level hierarchical structure of the problem fig 7 which facilitated the development of the preference matrix with regard to individual criteria table 1 summarizes the adopted criteria and the applied rating scales for all main criteria and sub criteria the paired comparison matrices were developed with the 9 point saaty s scale 72 table 4 first for groups and then for sub criteria within groups the fuzzy pairwise comparison matrix was developed by using classic pairwise comparison matrices in the same way as for ahp which were supplemented by adding fuzzy numbers the triangular fuzzy number c c 1 c 2 c 3 is determined by triple real numbers c 1 c 2 c 3 as follows 83 4 μ c x x c 1 c 2 c 1 c 1 x c 2 1 x c 2 c 3 x c 3 c 2 c 2 x c 3 0 o t h e r w i s e where c 1 c 2 c 3 are called lower c 1 middle c 2 and upper c 3 significant values with the middle values are equal to the values of the pairwise comparison matrix of the usual ahp method for positive triangular fuzzy numbers c c 1 c 2 c 3 and d d 1 d 2 d 3 the following operations are defined addition c d c 1 d 1 c 2 d 2 c 3 d 3 multiplication c d c 1 d 1 c 2 d 2 c 3 d 3 and division c d c 1 d 3 c 2 d 2 c 3 d 1 the reciprocal of c is defined as 1 c 1 c3 1 c2 1 c1 for n n n 2 the n th rootof c is defined as c n c 1 n c 2 n c 3 n lower and upper values were generated using the fuzzification factor according to table 5 the fuzzification factor δ 1 was adopted for the development of the fuzzy pairwise comparison matrix 5 fuzzy matrices consisting of vectors of triangular fuzzy numbers were obtained in the following form 5 b k b i j n n 1 1 1 l 12 m 12 u 12 l 1 n m 1 n u 1 n 1 l 12 1 m 12 1 u 12 1 1

over j th estimating the quality of the pairwise comparison matrix in the case of standard ahp is not a problem because the measure is then the consistency ratio cr 6 c r c i r i where c i λ max n n 1 λ max maximum eigenvalue of comparison matrices maximum eigenvalue n size of comparison matrices n 15 ri random index which is obtained by averaging the ci of a randomly generated reciprocal matrix 85 the cr values for individual matrices criteria for groups and sub criteria should not exceed the allowable threshold of 0 10 otherwise the pairwise comparison matrix should be re analysed however a fuzzy matrix consists of vectors of fuzzy numbers and is often inconsistent in nature some authors do not verify the consistency of fuzzy pairwise comparison matrices at all 86 88 others verify the consistency of fuzzy pairwise comparison matrices only for middle values of triangular fuzzy numbers from the corresponding fuzzy pairwise comparison matrix def c c 2 84 88 89 according to formula 3 in the same way as for standard ahp an alternative approach is to make the defuzzification of triangular fuzzy numbers there are many methods in the literature that enable defuzzification of triangular fuzzy numbers defuzzification is performed by taking the mean value 87 90 def c c 1 c 2 c 3 3 the mean with dominance 67 83 def c c 1 4 c 2 c 3 6 or for instance based on minimum and maximum values 91 the most common centroid index method developed by yager 92 93 is used in this paper 7 def c c 2 c 1 c 1 2 3 c 2 c 1 c 3 c 2 c 2 1 3 c 3 c 2 c 2 c 1 c 3 c 2 the weights w i w i 1 w i 2 w i 3 of a fuzzy comparison matrix for each obtained matrix are calculated by approach described by refs 83 94 by normalizing the geometric means of the rows of the pairwise comparison matrix 8 w i 1 min j 1 n b i j p k 1 p j 1 n b i j p b r s b r s 1 b r s 3 r s 1 p r s b s r 1 b r s r s 1 p r s b r r 1 r 1 p 9 w i 2 j 1 n b i j 2 p k 1 p j 1 n b i j 2 p 10 w i 3 max j 1 n b i j p k 1 p j 1 n b i j p b r s b r s 1 b r s 3 r s 1 p r s b s r 1 b r s r s 1 p r s b r r 1 r 1 p where p the number of b i j objects on one level of the hierarchy finally 5 local weight vectors were obtained w i w i 1 w i 2 w i 3 i 1 n respectively for the matrix of comparisons for criteria groups w g dla g1 g6 and for individual sub criteria w k 1 w k 6 for k1 k13 broken down into particular groups table 3 the sum of middle values of weights equals to 1 which is the basic axiom of ahp the difference between the sum of minimum value and maximum value represents a range of uncertainty or fuzziness in the computed weight and can be viewed as belief and plausibility respectively 84 the general weight u k u k 1 u k 2 u k 3 for the k th criterion was determined as 84 11 u k 1 w k 1 w g 1 w h e r e w k 1 g k 12 u k 2 w k 2 w g 2 w h e r e w k 2 g k 13 u k 3 w k 3 w g 3 w h e r e w k 3 g k then the obtained vectors were subject to fuzzification using the centroidal method proposed by ref 93 7 the final fuzzy ahp score f a i f a i 1 f a i 2 f a i 3 i 1 m m number of alternatives m 3 for each alternative the following was assigned 14 f a i k 1 n v a i k u k d where v a i k is the k th rating for the k th category for the i th of alternative a i while u k d is analogously the k th general weight after defuzzification for the k th category the analyses used the fuzzyahp 0 9 5 package for r 95 to determine the fuzzy pairwise comparison matrix and fuzzy local weights w i equations 8 10 2 9 sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis of the proposed decision model was carried out by modifying the weights w g only for the group of main criteria g1 g4 the weights were generated randomly for 100 repetitions in the range of 0 1 for individual main criteria then within the i th iteration of the weight g 1 i g 4 i and normalized so that their sum was 1 for the generated matrix of weights 100 wt vectors w g i for criteria g 1 i g 4 i 100 numerical simulations were carried out searching for the optimal solution using fahp in each iteration the global weights were obtained by multiplying the local weights of the criteria k 1 i k 13 i previously obtained for the pairwise comparison matrix tables 8 11 and subjected to the defuzzification process equation 7 by the normalized weights of the main criteria g 1 i g 4 i and according to equations 11 13 3 results 3 1 fhap analysis three variants of solutions for the operation of the small hydropower plant were proposed the solutions differed in increasing the level of damming variant 1 alternative a 1 increasing the damming level by 10 cm variant 2 alternative a 2 increasing the damming level by 20 cm variant 3 alternative a 3 increasing the damming level by 30 cm the conducted analyses allowed for developing ratings for individual variants alternatives in relation to the analysed criteria the adopted ratings are summarized in table 6 developing a pairwise comparison matrix can be troublesome in some cases this may happen because some information necessary in the decision making process may be imprecise or unknown another factor influencing the decision making process and consequently the final ranking may be the difficulty that decision makers experts may experience when they try to correctly describe their preferences in relation to the pairs of compared criteria in case of problems with the determination of the pairwise comparison matrix it is advisable to use fuzzy ahp 83 96 for the purposes of the study an analysis was carried out using the modified ahp method fuzzy ahp as a basis for considerations the initial pairwise comparison matrices were adopted in the same way as for standard ahp which were then fuzzified according to table 5 5 fuzzy pairwise comparison matrices were obtained tables 7 11 the fuzzification factor δ 1 was adopted the analyses used the fuzzyahp package version 0 9 5 for r for the fuzzification of pairwise matrix and determination of local weight vectors w i w i 1 w i 2 w i 3 local weight vectors for fuzzy numbers were determined using equations 5 7 global weight vectors u k u k 1 u k 2 u k 3 table 12 were determined in accordance with equations 11 13 it should be noted that the obtained weight vector for middle fuzzy numbers coincides with the weight vector for the pure standard ahp method then the weights were subjected to the defuzzification process in accordance with formula 7 obtaining the final weight vector table 12 the final ranking table 13 was determined in accordance with equation 14 the final ranking has got very balanced values it shows a slight advantage of the a 1 variant approx 39 points over other variants a1 a2 a3 in comparison to other alternatives variant a1 provides the smallest increase in electricity generation by approx 100 mwh year and therefore the smallest increase in the revenue which of course results from the lowest increase in the level of damming in practice this translates into a co2 reduction of approx 86 000 kg co2 per year to give a more complete picture variant a3 will enable up to three times greater increase in electricity generation and reduction of co2 emissions compared to a1 however both variant a2 and variant a3 are characterised by higher costs related to the modernisation of the facility and its subsequent operation this is particularly important in the context of the age of the object over 100 years additionally high social pressure exerted by local farmers whose arable lands are in the vicinity of the embankments of the section of the river affected by the rosko damming barrage is expected if alternatives a2 and a3 are selected for implementation the position in the ranking was determined in particular by technical g3 13 6 and economic g1 10 criteria the g2 criterion in which the a1 variant obtained the same score as alternative a2 had by far the least impact on the ranking within the g1 criterion obviously the most favourable variant is a3 11 7 yet its advantage is not significant not more than 2 points alternative a3 also gains a lot in terms of the g4 criterion due to a very large reduction of co2 however in each of the remaining groups of criteria it turned out to be the least favourable variant achieving even three times lower values than the optimal alternative for the technical criterion g3 when it comes to safety issues k8 alternative a1 turns out to be the best option the a 1 scenario gains a decisive advantage in the case of the g3 criteria technical criteria even three times more than other alternatives 3 2 sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis of the model was also performed 100 wt vectors w g in the range 0 1 only for the group of main criteria g1 g4 were randomly generated fig 8 in each iteration the global weights were obtained by multiplying the local weights of the k 1 i k 13 i c r i t e r i a tables 8 11 previously obtained for the pairwise comparison matrix and subjected to the defuzzification process equation 7 by the normalized weights of the main criteria g 1 i g 4 i according to equations 10 13 the sensitivity analysis shows that the ranking is very stable and in practically every iteration it was in line with the previously obtained results for alternatives a1 a2 a3 alternative a1 obtained the averaged ranking point value 40 28 median 40 56 sd 3 5028 and it was 96 times positioned as the first 4 times as the second and never as the third alternative a2 with the averaged point value 31 91 median 31 88 sd 1 08 was ranked 96 times as the first fig 10 4 times as the first and the third whereas alternative a3 with the averaged point value 27 82 median 27 94 sd 3 07 was 92 times positioned as the third 8 times as the second the notches surrounding the median in fig 9 indicate that differences in the medians of alternatives ai are essential the notches show 95 confidence intervals for the medians and the distance of irq n0 5interquartile range around the median 97 it can also be noticed that alternative a2 is characterized by the lowest point dispersion in the ranking the significantly greater point dispersion in the ranking for alternatives a1 and a3 results from the changes in the weights of the main criteria g1 and g4 and their relation to the weights of other criteria alternative a3 receives a high rating for g1 and g4 criteria 4 discussion the study analysed the impact of damming changes on the operation of a small hydroelectric power plant a series of simulations using fahp were carried out in order to determine the optimal variant of the damming change to the operation of the analysed hydropower facility the analyses took into account 13 criteria which were divided into four basic groups related to economic technical legal and socio environmental issues both fahp and the sensitivity analysis indicate that the most optimal variant in the light of the adopted criteria is the a1 variant which stands out in terms of technical criteria and is characterised by good ranking results in other main criteria the obtained rankings are stable practically in each iteration of the sensitivity analysis alternative a1 turned out to be the most optimal the most optimal alternative a1 will increase electricity generation by 108 78 mwh annually while reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 86000 kg co2 it is worth emphasising however that this is the variant leading to the smallest annual increase in power production and reduction of co2 emissions nevertheless the applied methodology shows that this variant has the best chance of implementation taking into consideration economic legal and social factors it will give the investor facility operator a chance to avoid a failed implementation of an unrealistic scenario assuming an increase in the shp s efficiency vassoney 98 analysed the possibility of using decision making tools such as multi criteria decision making methods mcdm in aosta valley nw italy to define an optimal environmental flow scenario to be released by pumped storage plants also to balance the needs of energy production economic profitability and environmental protection for this purpose they considered the impact of four criteria energy environment and fisheries landscape economy in their analyses they applied seven different mcdm methods to the existing small flow power plant i e saw wpm ahp topsis vikor electre iii and share mca they obtained a very good correlation between the share mca saw wpm ahp and topsis methods whereas vikor and electre iii produced different results not only in ranking but also in format however the authors indicated that when it comes to the number of criteria and alternatives ahp is subject to certain limitations a large number of items to be compared in pairs may reduce the consistency of rankings made by decision makers finally ahp requires the highest level of user interaction who are asked to perform several pairwise comparisons for each level of the hierarchical structure on the other hand in ahp alternatives can be compared in pairs even with reference to a qualitative criterion using the saaty s fundamental scale the literature offers numerous publications describing the use of mcda methods including ahp and fahp that are applied to select the optimal location of shps 34 35 38 99 as most of the environmental and social problems associated with hydropower production are directly related to their location it is important to consider economic social and environmental criteria when selecting a hydropower site accordingly the decision making process must take into account both qualitative and quantitative factors 99 the use of multi criteria methods including ahp and fahp is an excellent solution that allows scientists and decision makers to select optimal locations for the construction of hydropower plants while taking into account important economic social and environmental criteria the location and operation of shp on a global basis as a network of small power plants may also be optimized 37 38 100 when there are difficulties in developing a pairwise comparison matrix i e difficulties in defining clearly precise defined preference values by experts or decision makers the fuzzy set theory and fuzzy ahp 76 can be successfully applied which makes the evaluation results more reasonable and comprehensive 77 the parameterisation of decision models is associated with many uncertainties related to i e imprecise data and problems with the correct development of pairwise comparison matrices in order to fully assess the project the analyses should take into account not only a quantitative approach economic or technical but also qualitative often difficult to measure values such as the values of natural resources or environmental protection 101 the imprecision and uncertainty of the decision model and the preferences of experts can be taken into account by introducing fuzzy numbers and for instance fuzzy ahp the usefulness of this approach was confirmed by ref 29 who compared the use of fuzzy ahp and topsis in flood polder planning methods they indicated that despite some differences both methods with common goals are similar and such tools should always be used in decision support system dss fuzzy ahp can be considered more flexible and reliable for the assessment of water management plans 102 also under conditions of uncertainty 103 a certain type of validation of the analyses carried out is the current status of the request for a change in the damming level the administrator of the river and damming structures does not agree to discuss any change in the damming level above 0 1 m i e the a1 variant the main concern expressed by the representatives of the administrator are the safety issues of the damming barrage which in their opinion are difficult to fully analyse due to the age of the damming structure and the deficiencies in its technical documentation the activity of the local community has also increased whose representatives express the opinion that the existing state should not change and from the moment of obtaining information on the proposed changes they often monitor the damming level on the rosko barrage the above factors were considered in this analysis as highly weighted destimulants and proved to be decisive in determining the final ranking of the proposed alternatives 5 conclusions the authors of the article proposed a methodology for assessing the operation of shps and supporting decision making processes when it is necessary to change the operation regime of a small hydropower plant due to for instance changes in its hydrological conditions when performing analyses it is important to consider not only the economic aspects of projects but also other values that are often difficult to measure i e the value of natural resources legal conditions and requirements or a social situation the proposed criteria and sub criteria can be easily adapted to the specificity of a given facility and the use of fuzzy logic will successfully eliminate the emerging difficulties with developing a pairwise comparison matrix consequently it is possible to overcome the difficulties with identifying evident clearly defined preference values by experts decision makers which will make evaluation results more reasonable and comprehensive also the authors proposed a sensitivity analysis procedure that enables the estimation of model stability and the resulting ranking of alternatives the article proposes an optimisation model thanks to which it was possible to choose the optimal change of the shp work regime so as to simultaneously increase the production of green energy thus limiting the emission of co2 to the atmosphere at the same time the model provided the best chance for implementation particularly in the context of the operational safety of accompanying facilities as well as administrative legal and social realities in the country of location of a small hydropower plant shp the proposed a1 variant will enable to increase electricity production by approx 110 mwh per year with a simultaneous reduction of co2 emissions by 86 000 kg which in the situation of high costs of raw materials for conventional energy or their limited availability for instance due to the geopolitical context is particularly desirable variant a1 with the highest chance of success proved not necessarily the most economically viable option however this was determined by non economic criteria in particular technical criteria related to safety issues of the existing 100 year old facility and the possible need to extend the technical infrastructure which in this case would be the smallest of the three alternatives analysed the sensitivity analysis for the 100 random vectors of weights of the main criteria g1 g4 shows the stability of the ranking alternative a1 received a mean score of 40 28 median 40 56 sd 3 5028 in the rankings and was ranked first 96 times in more than 90 of the situations analysed alternative a3 was ranked third despite being the most economically optimal again non economic criteria proved to be more important in particular construction safety when deciding on the construction and operation as well as the modernisation of facilities especially where the safety of both the facility and the associated infrastructure and surroundings is crucial economic criteria should not be decisive when making decisions tools and methods should be used to solve complex and complicated decision making problems in which both quantitative and qualitative aspects of the problem are taken into account one such method is the fahp method which unlike the classic ahp method makes it possible to eliminate the difficulty of developing a matrix of pairwise comparisons and defining clear explicit preferences by experts and decision makers any analysis using the ahp fahp method should also be complemented by as extensive a sensitivity analysis as possible this makes it possible to dynamically change the importance of individual criteria and to observe the impact of these changes on the final rankings and thus estimate the model s stability it also makes it possible to identify those criteria subcriteria whose change sometimes independent of the investor may cause significant changes in the ranking and thus influence the choice of the optimal alternative the proposed methodology can be easily used for the analysis and optimisation of other shp objects taking into account of course the local conditions of a given object credit authorship contribution statement ireneusz laks investigation conceptualization methodology writing

8739,small hydropower plants are one of the most important renewable energy sources that do not degrade and consume natural resource the paper presents a case study of an already operating small hydropower plant shp and a potential increase in its energy production by raising the damming level three variants were defined and subjected to detailed analysing the analyses used the fuzzy ahp

vlšekriterijumsko kompromisno rangiranje wpm weighted product method 1 introduction in present times high greenhouse gas emissions have caused major changes to the atmosphere 1 therefore it is pivotal to use sustainable energy resources to the maximum extent possible this is particularly important in the areas where there are no environmental economic or social opportunities to produce energy by conventional means characterised by exhaustiveness and limitation here renewable sources are an alternative solution the natural reservoirs of which do not diminish during energy production or are rebuilt very quickly without the risk of a deficit occurrence these include wind energy solar radiation energy geothermal energy hydropower wave energy ocean current and tidal energy energy from biomass biogas and bioliquids the development of technology allows for introducing solutions that will ensure constant access to energy for all consumers renewable energy sources res are available everywhere anywhere on the surface of the globe also above and below it only the sun alone provides annually to earth 10 000 times more energy than the consumption of man made energy at the same time therefore the use of the latest res technologies has become one of the pro developmental objectives for many countries around the world 2 at present their development is particularly important as we experience climate change and there is a risk of failure to provide energy security electricity from renewable energy sources accounts for 33 of the total installed capacity in the world and is gaining global recognition as a tool to mitigate climate change 3 accordingly national energy policies should be oriented towards the use and exploration of renewable resources on a large scale the construction of small hydropower plants is booming around the world 4 many governments are subsidizing the construction of small hydropower plants because they are perceived as having less negative impact on the environment than large hydropower plants 5 nowadays there is a noticeable trend consisting in a significant increase in support for the broad development of small hydropower plants shps the global synthesis shows that 82 891 shps are in operation or under construction 11 shps per large hydropower plant and it is estimated that this number would triple if all potential capacity was used 5 the development of shp has been driven by substantial political 6 10 economic and environmental stimuli hydroelectric power plants are one of the key sources of renewable energy 11 14 globally they satisfy nearly 17 of the world s electricity demand international hydropower association 2018 the natural flow regime plays a fundamental role in the process of obtaining energy from hydropower plants but it is also the main driving force of various biological processes and it guarantees long term ecological vitality 15 however inadequate exploitation of water resources can profoundly undermine the integrity of fluvial ecosystems 16 therefore the location of small hydropower plants should be carefully examined and chosen with the use of i e geographic information system gis studies in this area were conducted by ref 17 the right approach to choosing the location of shps within the river network can reduce their negative impact on the biodiversity of existing fauna and flora hydropower as a renewable energy source has got numerous advantages including low operating and maintenance costs high efficiency approx 60 80 and long service life of installed devices 18 as well as low requirements for the value of hydraulic head the above is confirmed by refs 3 19 on the other hand there are some disadvantages to hydropower systems i e variability of the water flow rate throughout the year water availability high initial costs and a long time of construction according to ref 20 hydropower plants producing electricity from natural sources do not cause any pollution or damage to the environment however hydropower systems can alter natural flow regimes and deteriorate the condition of river ecosystems at various trophic levels 21 the most common environmental impacts observed are changes in the flow regime less water in the downstream loss of watercourse capacity injuries to fish habitat degradation and deterioration of the species diversity of fish and macroinvertebrates shps work and the choice of their location is affected by numerous different quantitative and qualitative factors taking the right decisions requires the use of methods that optimise decisions based on various criteria the methods of multi criteria optimisation mcdm multi criteria decision making and mcda multi criteria decision analysis allow for the comparison of decision variants and the selection of optimal solutions although they cover defined often contradictory criteria the mcda methods have some undoubted advantages they ease to solve problems described by various measures rank qualitative and quantitative factors allow for the participation of interested persons in the decision making process include the community at every stage of the analysis starting from defining options for solutions selecting criteria and preferences up to indicating the final solution the disadvantages of mcda include the risk of subjectivity in assigning weights by experts to individual criteria which in turn may lead to obtaining different solutions proposed by different people depending on the priorities they indicate 22 23 among the mcda methods one of the most frequently used is ahp analytic hierarchy process 24 25 widely used in many optimisations it has also found application in the field associated with hydraulic engineering i e flood risk planning assessment and management 26 33 or the selection of the location of small hydropower plants shps 34 36 and their management 37 38 is one of the most appropriate methods for flood risk assessment 39 also with the use of gis tools gis mcda to build flood hazard maps 40 43 or to select the location of dams 17 particularly in combination with other methods 44 in the method the decision problem is divided into criteria reflecting its important aspects often it also introduces the division into main criteria and sub criteria within individual criteria which significantly facilitates the development of a pairwise comparison matrix defining the preferences of decision makers and determining the weighting of criteria in particular if there are many of them and creating one matrix of comparisons would be very troublesome since subjective assessments assigned to particular criteria by experts may be imprecise an alternative approach can be the application of the fuzzy set theory and the use of fuzzy ahp fahp in analyses 45 48 dissimilarly to ahp instead of clearly defined discrete values the fahp method shows some fuzzification of values through the use of fuzzy numbers which allows for including the uncertainty of decision makers and fuzzy numbers are used to represent human judgments more realistically the literature offers many approaches to the fuzzification of ahp methods 46 49 51 which differ among others in various fuzziness functions the most commonly used fuzziness functions are triangular nevertheless trapezoidal 52 or spherical ones 53 are also applied making the right decision on how to plan and or manage technical infrastructure facilities including hydrotechnical objects requires analysing all known criteria related to the problem in many cases a large number of criteria that need to be taken into account their considerably different nature quantitative qualitative as well as the necessity to combine and reconcile all conflicting criteria hinder the process of decision making therefore this process should be based on one of the many available methods i e mcda mcdm multiple criteria decision analysis multiple criteria decision making an extensive list of methods and popular software used in the analysis of sustainable development of renewable energy can be found in the work by kumar 22 in addition the fahp method was used to assess the potential of alternative renewable energy sources for electricity production selection of the optimal location of facilities producing energy from such sources or the capability of changing the work of these objects karakaş and yildiran 54 used a modified fahp method to evaluate five alternatives of renewable energy production in turkey i e hydropower wind solar biomass and geothermal energy sources the purpose of their study was to assess the most suitable renewable energy alternative in order to determine the ratings of each renewable energy alternative four main criteria c1 technical c2 economic c3 environmental and c4 social and eight sub criteria were adopted to assess five alternative renewable energy sources the results indicate that experts considered the environmental criterion as more important than others moreover the technical criterion was identified as the second most important according to the results solar energy was considered the best alternative and wind energy the second best alternative for turkey the researchers also pointed out that while the order of these alternatives kept changing wind power and solar power were found to be the most suitable renewable energy alternatives for turkey in most studies similarly ertaya et al 55 used macbeth and ahp based multicriteria methods for the evaluation of renewable energy alternatives under fuzziness they used 4 main criteria and 15 sub criteria in the assessment the researchers identified potential renewable energy alternatives for turkey as solar wind hydro and geothermal also karatop et al 56 assessed the risks of renewable energy alternatives using fuzzy failure mode and effect analysis fuzzy ahp edas fuzzy fmea finally the best alternatives were identified by comparing the assessment results in the analyses the researchers determined how to make optimal investment decisions in the renewable energy sector in turkey based on the growing global importance of renewable energy they proposed a model that enables more credible renewable energy investment decisions by combining both prioritization and risk analysis the fuzzy analytical hierarchy process fuzzy ahp and the evaluation based on distance from average solution edas methods were used to prioritize renewable energy alternatives and the fuzzy failure mode and effect analysis fmea method was applied to identify risks of renewable energy alternatives the researchers indicated that turkey should focus on hydro and wind power in its renewable energy investments yucesan and kahraman 57 conducted risk assessment for hydropower plants using the pythagorean fuzzy analytical hierarchy process pfahp to make the process of risk assessment more efficient the analyses used the opinion of five hydropower plant decision makers the team of experts identified and demonstrated twenty hazards and their effects that may occur during the operation of hydropower facilities this enabled the identification of major considerable threats c19 entering the generator cell without informing the control operator was considered by decision makers as the biggest risk c14 both malfunction of the switches and safety valves of compressed air and oil tanks risk of explosion resulting in excessive pressure increase was recognized by decision makers as the second greatest threat c17 rise of turbine pit water due to turbine pit seal failure was determined by decision makers as the third most important hazard preventive actions were proposed in order to avoid the hazards considered as the most threatening ram and chandna 58 used fahp to evaluate the sensitivity of the hydroelectric system taking the human failure into consideration using fuzzy analytic hierarchy process approach six different failure rates were taken into consideration the fuzzy approach incorporated all the vagueness and uncertainty existing in the power system due to different failure and repair rates pavlović et al 59 used fahp to assess the potential of renewable energy sources that could be used in the serbian energy sector the four most potential ress for electricity generation in serbia biomass hydro solar and wind were assessed four main criteria were adopted economic technical environmental and socio political the researchers based on the fahp analysis indicated that hydropower and biomass have the highest potential among available renewable energy sources the new fuzzy integrated delphi fahp fpromethee methodology was applied by seddiki and bennadji 60 with the objective to select the best renewable energy alternatives in a residential building in algeria the first step using the delphi method involved selecting an initial set of alternative renewable energy sources for electricity generation and an initial set of criteria economic environmental social etc then using fahp criteria weights were developed taking into account the uncertainty of expert assessments the global ranking was created using fpromethee fuzzy preference ranking organization method for enrichment evaluation wang et al 61 proposed a hybrid method by applying the fuzzy ahp and topsis methods together to select the most appropriate location for a wind farm to be built in vietnam sensitivity analysis is an important element of decision models also for the fahp method 62 63 although it is not always performed primarily due to the complexity of some procedures the required computation time and limited resources available for this purpose 64 it enables the estimation of uncertainty in fuzzy and multi criteria analyses the results obtained from the sensitivity analysis can be used to answer what if questions the final ranking of alternatives may largely depend on the weights adopted for individual criteria and the subjective assessment of importance of criteria in pairwise comparison matrices the sensitivity analysis provides information on changes in the rankings of variants depending on changes in the parameters of the analysed decision model and provides information on the stability of the method 65 66 there are several approaches to the sensitivity analysis of fahp in the literature such an analysis can be conducted by modifying the weights of criteria 27 63 67 69 the oat one at a time approach modifies the weight of only one criterion after which the decision model is re analysed and a new ranking is created a probabilistic approach i e using the monte carlo method 70 72 assumes that all criteria weights are generated completely randomly to discover how the ranking of alternatives changes under any conditions 73 an alternative approach is to modify the fuzzification factor δ when constructing triangular fuzzy numbers tfns 62 64 74 75 the initial value of the coefficient is usually taken as δ 1 the aim of the study is to analyse the possibility of changing the damming level of the existing small hydropower plant on the noteć river in rosko north western poland taking into account economic administrative technical environmental legal and social factors using the mcdm multi criteria optimisation method the variant with parameters with the greatest chance of implementation was selected the data necessary to support the decision making process was obtained from the archives of the shp owner in particular information on energy production in 2020 hydraulic analyses were also performed based on a numerical model of transient flows in order to quantify the impact of changing the damming level on the river section above the barrage the remaining data for the mcdm method was determined based on the data found in the literature as well as applicable ordinances and legal regulations due to the diversity of data the decision making process of selecting the most favourable variant is not simple and may be burdened with high uncertainty hence the need to conduct sensitivity analyses of the methods applied it is worth emphasising that both the scientific and engineering literature lack information on the practical use of advanced methods of decision support in the process of changing the operating conditions of small hydrotechnical facilities analyses indicating whether the adopted scheme of changing shp operating parameters can be implemented are not carried out which often leads to generating unnecessary costs and workload for facility operators a factor affecting the decision making process and consequently the final ranking may be that decision makers and experts find difficulty in correctly describing their own preferences when there are problems with developing a pairwise comparison matrix for instance difficulties with determining clear obviously defined preference values by experts or decision makers the theory of fuzzy sets and fuzzy ahp 76 can be successfully applied making evaluation results more reasonable and comprehensive 77 the work also analysed the stability of the obtained ranking by modifying the weights for the group of criteria g1 g4 the methodology presented in the work fills this gap and shows the effectiveness of its application even in the case of small hydrotechnical facilities 2 materials and methods the usefulness of decision models depends on a possibly credible set of input data based on objective quantitative and qualitative analyses for hydropower plants these analyses concern hydraulic hydrological operational economic ecological legal and social aspects such a variety of areas causes that input data for models are not homogeneous and in many situations they are qualitative and subjective the use of mcdm methods is associated with accepting the susceptibility of the final results to non objective qualitative measures on the other hand it is difficult to find objective methods preferably quantitative in all required areas which can be verified and subject to validation procedures for the discussed shp rosko four main criteria were adopted and analysed with fuzzy ahp fahp they were assigned detailed sub criteria as illustrated in fig 1 the economic criterion is objective quantitative and relatively easy to determine for individual variants the owner of the hydropower plant has and made available the data necessary to determine individual cost items the legal criterion is qualitative due to its high uncertainty as to the reactions of officials and the local community in many cases issuing administrative documentation depends on the competence of the official to whom the application is submitted the existing legal regulations may also change which may extend and prolong the decision making process and sometimes even cancel it unfortunately for many countries these elements are very uncertain in equal measure in economically well developed regions the technical criteria are quantitative and objective moreover they can influence the qualitative criteria in this case legal social and environmental this in particular concerns administrative arrangements the applicant demonstrating objectively and quantitatively the impact of the change on hydrotechnical facilities and a given section of the river can explain the concerns of people who administer and manage these facilities also the local community and environmental organisations should obtain objective and quantitative information that will help them understand the concept of change in the discussed example the socio environmental criteria are mixed some of them can be estimated quantitatively reduction of co2 emissions impact on tourism and water transport and others qualitatively in the further part of the work two quantitative analyses are discussed in detail which allowed for a good estimation of parameters for the mcdm method used these are the hydraulic analysis of the impact of the damming level on the section of the noteć river above the damming barrage and the analysis of the increase in electricity production 2 1 general information on shp rosko shp rosko fig 2 is the largest installation in poland to generate renewable energy using archimedes screw spiral turbines the installation consists of 6 spiral turbine sets 60 kw each total output is 360 kw the hydropower plant was designed and constructed for hydraulic head 1 72 m at installed flow rate 30 m3s 1 5 m3s 1 each turbine set the diameter of one turbine is 3 2 m water from the power plant is discharged by a 550 m long fully reconstructed power channel the estimated annual production of renewable energy is approx 2000 mwh the expected reduction of co2 emissions will amount to approx 2531 t year the amount of primary energy saved will amount to approx 21 627 06 gj year the hydropower plant was put into operation on 15 06 2014 commence of the technological start up the use permit was obtained on 18 07 2014 by the decision of the president of the energy regulatory office pol ure of 19 09 2014 it was granted a license to produce electricity shp rosko is located within the hydro node of the noteć river in rosko which consists of a damming weir and a single chamber lock both buildings are concrete objects the damming weir has the following technical parameters hydraulic head 1 41 m number of spans 3 gap 25 92 m threshold ordinate 33 67 m a s l kr normal water level 36 66 m a s l kr maximum water level 36 97 m a s l kr design flow q m q2 is 139 2 m3s 1 2 2 hydraulic analysis of the impact of the damming level on the section of the noteć river above the damming barrage an important element that might be decisive in gaining the approval from the authorities managing the river and hydrotechnical facilities is the performance of reliable analyses of the impact of changing the damming level on the section of the river above the water barrage this applies in particular to the impact on the damming level above mikołajewo possibility of affecting the facilities draining water from the adjacent areas increased pressure on the embankments change in the depth for water transport and change in the flow velocity the owner of the power plant commissioned the authors of the study to perform such analyses using a numerical flow model the hydraulic analysis included the following stages 1 bathymetric surveys of the noteć section above the rosko damming barrage 12 bathymetric sections 2 measurement of flows and water table ordinates for different levels of damming 3 processing bathymetric data 4 preparing a data set for a numerical hydrodynamic model 5 making calibration and model verification calculations 6 analysis of the impact of change in the damming level based on the numerical flow model as mentioned earlier the field research included measurements of water table ordinates flow rates and bathymetry of cross sections measurements of water table ordinates were made with the use of gps rtk sokkia 11 geodetic equipment the measurements were used for calibrating a computational model 28 measurements of water table ordinates were carried out in two series for different damming levels flow measurements were made with the adcp streampro probe 78 which also enabled the acquisition of information on the bathymetry of the watercourse bottom data from the adcp probe was imported into the winriver ii data processing postprocessor the application allows for determining the flow value as well as export bathymetry data as text files fig 3 is a screenshot of the winriver ii application with windows showing a summary of flow measurements direction of the device movement along with the water flow direction and the velocity distribution in the measurement section with depth and distance from the riverbank fig 4 shows the bathymetry for the cross section at km 154 068 carried out based on the measurements made with the streampro adcp probe this cross section and other measurement cross sections were used to generate data for the numerical flow model 2 3 the flow model on the noteć river section from km 148 840 to km 154 068 the one dimensional transient flow analysis and forecasting system spruner 79 was used to analyse the flow conditions of the noteć river in the section above shp rosko it can model the operation of the system of polders embankment overflows water barrages and widespread floodplain valleys to describe the transient flow transformation it uses the well known and widely described saint venant equation system 1 and 2 mass continuity equation 1 q x a t q momentum balance equation amount of motion 2 q t β q 2 a x g a h x s f s e c w 0 where q discharge m3s 1 h water table ordinate m x position coordinate m a flow field m2 t time s g acceleration due to gravity ms 2 q lateral inflow m2s 1 β saint venant factor s f hydraulic head solving these equations 1 and 2 is possible provided that the initial boundary problem is correctly formulated due to the non linear nature of the equations their solutions for natural channels can only be searched for by numerical methods most of the currently existing transient flow models based on saint venant equations including the spruner system use the finite difference method and the implicit differential scheme to discretize flow equations 80 2 4 calculation model the created calculation model covered a 5268 m long section of the noteć river from km 148 840 cross section located directly above the weir of the rosko dam to km 154 068 cross section located below the dam in mikołajewo the model contains 33 cross sections connected in 32 calculation segments the location of these cross sections along with their mileage is shown in fig 2 the model used bathymetric sections implemented during the field research 12 sections the measured bathymetric cross sections were used to generate intermediate cross sections which supplemented the data on the geometry of the flow area the level hydrograph in the lower riverside cross section 148 84 and the flow hydrograph in the upper riverside cross section 154 068 were assumed as the boundary conditions calibration was performed for the data on the flows and levels as of 30 04 2018 the measured flow in the cross section above the rosko shp was 34 95 m3s 1 and in the cross section below the barrage at km 154 068 equalled to 35 1 m3s 1 a small difference in the flow measurements indicates the existence of steady motion conditions in this period very small flow fluctuation over time 14 ordinate measurements mentioned above were made for this flow the ordinate measured in the riverside cross section at 148 840 was the lower boundary condition value hydrograph of levels constant over time the upper boundary condition was set as a constant flow hydrograph 35 m3s 1 the hydrographs of boundary conditions that are constant over time force the computational model based on the equations of transient motion to fulfil the criterion of steady motion the measurement data and the results from the numerical model are presented in table 1 the accuracy of altitude measurements with the rtk gps apparatus is 0 01 m hence the process of calibration of the roughness coefficients for individual sections was considered completed when the differences between the measured and calculated levels were less than 1 cm the average difference between the measured and calculated values adopted as a metric for fitting the model to the object was 0 0041 m the values of roughness coefficients according to manning s formula varied from 0 022 to 0 024 the measurement was carried out in the spring before the beginning of the activation of bottom and bank vegetation hence it should be assumed that in the summer and autumn the resistance to motion may be even greater the thesis was confirmed by flow measurements made in the autumn on 16 09 2017 and 15 11 2017 flow measurements were made for two different damming 70 and 86 m3s 1 respectively for two ordinates of 36 67 and 36 78 m a s l roughness coefficients for the summer and autumn periods ranged from 0 0253 to 0 0276 the proposed calibrated model for two sets of roughness coefficients for spring and for summer autumn was additionally verified on the basis of field measurements verification measurements were made on october 17 2018 summer autumn period and april 5 2019 spring period and also showed an accuracy of 1 cm therefore the model was considered credible the calibrated numerical model was used to carry out simulations determining the effect of damming at the rosko barrage on the water levels in the noteć river within km 148 840 and 154 068 it has been shown that this impact will decrease primarily with an increasing flow also an increase in flow resistances reduces the impact of the damming change in the section upstream of the rosko hydropower plant table 2 and fig 5 show the change in water levels in section 154 068 located below the mikołajewo damming barrage depending on the value of the flow in the spring and summer autumn period for the damming increment equal to 0 1 m calculations confirmed that the change in the damming level at the rosko barrage will affect the water levels in the downstream of the mikołajewo barrage the same analyses were performed for the damming level increase by 0 2 m and 0 3 m which allowed for determining the rating scales for fuzzy ahp a change by 0 1 and 0 2 m will not disturb the drainage of water from the adjacent areas will increase the transit depth for water transport and will reduce the velocity of water flow when the damming level changes by 0 3 m it affects the hydrotechnical structures that drain water and increases the pressure on the embankments 2 5 calculation of the annual increase in electricity production the purpose of raising the damming level is of course to increase the annual energy production and thus generate additional income the power of a hydropower plant in kilowatts is calculated according to the generally known formula 3 n n 9 81 h q where n total efficiency coefficient h hydraulic head m q flow rate m3s 1 therefore the output of a hydropower plant increases linearly with an increase in the value of h during the operation of such a plant its operator can maintain the assumed damming level but they have no or a very limited influence on the flow rate the efficiency of turbines also does not have a constant value and it changes with the change in flow rates and hydraulic heads in order to estimate the value of annual production increase the information of the hydropower plant owner on energy production in 2020 was used the set of data that was obtained contained the information on the values of daily energy production flow rate and hydraulic head based on the data the actual efficiencies n were calculated from formula 3 the average efficiency coefficient for the entire period was 0 563 and the standard deviation was equal to 0 108 by determining the efficiency coefficient for each day the daily increase in production was calculated which would be the result of increasing the damming level by 0 1 0 2 0 3 m respectively fig 6 shows the actual daily energy production in 2020 and the value estimated with an increase in the damming level by 0 2 m the total actual annual electricity production of shp rosko was 1842 82 mwh the estimated values of energy production for the damming level of 0 1 0 2 and 0 3 m are 1951 60 2060 38 and 2169 16 mwh respectively annual production increase for individual damming levels would be then equal to 108 78 217 56 and 326 34 mwh respectively 2 6 impact of damming level increase on greenhouse gas emissions additional production of energy from renewable sources clearly reduces greenhouse gas emissions poland is a country where electricity production is still based on conventional sources mainly hard coal and lignite it is assumed 81 that in poland the production of 1 mwh of electricity from conventional sources emits 850 kg co2 increasing the damming level by 3 values mentioned above will reduce co2 emissions by 86000 178000 and 270000 kg respectively 2 7 legal and social situation as mentioned earlier shp rosko is located within the barrage consisting of a damming weir and a lock the owner of these facilities in accordance with the water law in force in poland is the state institution responsible for their operation the owner of the hydropower plant has acquired the consent of the manager of the damming facility for the construction and operation of the power plant for the damming level defined in the so called water permit safe from the point of view of the weir and the lock s operation both the weir and the lock are objects that were built over 100 years ago they are subject to very strict regulations regarding their operation and the manager is very reluctant to any changes damming level increase will have a positive effect on increasing retention capacity and will improve navigation conditions in the section above the hydropower plant however the disadvantageous effect may be a reduction in the velocity of flowing water and greater pressure on the overgrowth of the riverbed and consequently an increase in the maintenance costs of this section of the river another important aspect is the social pressure exerted by local farmers whose farmland is in the vicinity of the embankments of the river section affected by the rosko dam these people closely observe all activities related to the operation of hydrotechnical facilities and try to prove often unfoundedly their negative impact on the land they use also they are supported by environmental organisations which on the one hand sympathise with increasing the energy production from renewable energy sources but on the other hand are very reluctant to accept any changes that may affect the ecosystem 2 8 assumptions for fuzzy ahp the analyses adopted 13 criteria table 3 which were additionally divided into four main criteria economic g1 legal g2 technical g3 socio environmental g4 appropriate sub criteria were assigned to each of the designated groups creating a multi level hierarchical structure of the problem fig 7 which facilitated the development of the preference matrix with regard to individual criteria table 1 summarizes the adopted criteria and the applied rating scales for all main criteria and sub criteria the paired comparison matrices were developed with the 9 point saaty s scale 72 table 4 first for groups and then for sub criteria within groups the fuzzy pairwise comparison matrix was developed by using classic pairwise comparison matrices in the same way as for ahp which were supplemented by adding fuzzy numbers the triangular fuzzy number c c 1 c 2 c 3 is determined by triple real numbers c 1 c 2 c 3 as follows 83 4 μ c x x c 1 c 2 c 1 c 1 x c 2 1 x c 2 c 3 x c 3 c 2 c 2 x c 3 0 o t h e r w i s e where c 1 c 2 c 3 are called lower c 1 middle c 2 and upper c 3 significant values with the middle values are equal to the values of the pairwise comparison matrix of the usual ahp method for positive triangular fuzzy numbers c c 1 c 2 c 3 and d d 1 d 2 d 3 the following operations are defined addition c d c 1 d 1 c 2 d 2 c 3 d 3 multiplication c d c 1 d 1 c 2 d 2 c 3 d 3 and division c d c 1 d 3 c 2 d 2 c 3 d 1 the reciprocal of c is defined as 1 c 1 c3 1 c2 1 c1 for n n n 2 the n th rootof c is defined as c n c 1 n c 2 n c 3 n lower and upper values were generated using the fuzzification factor according to table 5 the fuzzification factor δ 1 was adopted for the development of the fuzzy pairwise comparison matrix 5 fuzzy matrices consisting of vectors of triangular fuzzy numbers were obtained in the following form 5 b k b i j n n 1 1 1 l 12 m 12 u 12 l 1 n m 1 n u 1 n 1 l 12 1 m 12 1 u 12 1 1 1 l 2 n m 2 n u 2 n 1 l 1 n 1 m 1 n 1 u 1 n 1 l 2 n 1 m 2 n 1 u 2 n 1 1 1 f o r i j 1 2 n where l ij m ij and u ij are lower middle and upper of triangular fuzzy numbers denoting the dominance of i th over j th estimating the quality of the pairwise comparison matrix in the case of standard ahp is not a problem because the measure is then the consistency ratio cr 6 c r c i r i where c i λ max n n 1 λ max maximum eigenvalue of comparison matrices maximum eigenvalue n size of comparison matrices n 15 ri random index which is obtained by averaging the ci of a randomly generated reciprocal matrix 85 the cr values for individual matrices criteria for groups and sub criteria should not exceed the allowable threshold of 0 10 otherwise the pairwise comparison matrix should be re analysed however a fuzzy matrix consists of vectors of fuzzy numbers and is often inconsistent in nature some authors do not verify the consistency of fuzzy pairwise comparison matrices at all 86 88 others verify the consistency of fuzzy pairwise comparison matrices only for middle values of triangular fuzzy numbers from the corresponding fuzzy pairwise comparison matrix def c c 2 84 88 89 according to formula 3 in the same way as for standard ahp an alternative approach is to make the defuzzification of triangular fuzzy numbers there are many methods in the literature that enable defuzzification of triangular fuzzy numbers defuzzification is performed by taking the mean value 87 90 def c c 1 c 2 c 3 3 the mean with dominance 67 83 def c c 1 4 c 2 c 3 6 or for instance based on minimum and maximum values 91 the most common centroid index method developed by yager 92 93 is used in this paper 7 def c c 2 c 1 c 1 2 3 c 2 c 1 c 3 c 2 c 2 1 3 c 3 c 2 c 2 c 1 c 3 c 2 the weights w i w i 1 w i 2 w i 3 of a fuzzy comparison matrix for each obtained matrix are calculated by approach described by refs 83 94 by normalizing the geometric means of the rows of the pairwise comparison matrix 8 w i 1 min j 1 n b i j p k 1 p j 1 n b i j p b r s b r s 1 b r s 3 r s 1 p r s b s r 1 b r s r s 1 p r s b r r 1 r 1 p 9 w i 2 j 1 n b i j 2 p k 1 p j 1 n b i j 2 p 10 w i 3 max j 1 n b i j p k 1 p j 1 n b i j p b r s b r s 1 b r s 3 r s 1 p r s b s r 1 b r s r s 1 p r s b r r 1 r 1 p where p the number of b i j objects on one level of the hierarchy finally 5 local weight vectors were obtained w i w i 1 w i 2 w i 3 i 1 n respectively for the matrix of comparisons for criteria groups w g dla g1 g6 and for individual sub criteria w k 1 w k 6 for k1 k13 broken down into particular groups table 3 the sum of middle values of weights equals to 1 which is the basic axiom of ahp the difference between the sum of minimum value and maximum value represents a range of uncertainty or fuzziness in the computed weight and can be viewed as belief and plausibility respectively 84 the general weight u k u k 1 u k 2 u k 3 for the k th criterion was determined as 84 11 u k 1 w k 1 w g 1 w h e r e w k 1 g k 12 u k 2 w k 2 w g 2 w h e r e w k 2 g k 13 u k 3 w k 3 w g 3 w h e r e w k 3 g k then the obtained vectors were subject to fuzzification using the centroidal method proposed by ref 93 7 the final fuzzy ahp score f a i f a i 1 f a i 2 f a i 3 i 1 m m number of alternatives m 3 for each alternative the following was assigned 14 f a i k 1 n v a i k u k d where v a i k is the k th rating for the k th category for the i th of alternative a i while u k d is analogously the k th general weight after defuzzification for the k th category the analyses used the fuzzyahp 0 9 5 package for r 95 to determine the fuzzy pairwise comparison matrix and fuzzy local weights w i equations 8 10 2 9 sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis of the proposed decision model was carried out by modifying the weights w g only for the group of main criteria g1 g4 the weights were generated randomly for 100 repetitions in the range of 0 1 for individual main criteria then within the i th iteration of the weight g 1 i g 4 i and normalized so that their sum was 1 for the generated matrix of weights 100 wt vectors w g i for criteria g 1 i g 4 i 100 numerical simulations were carried out searching for the optimal solution using fahp in each iteration the global weights were obtained by multiplying the local weights of the criteria k 1 i k 13 i previously obtained for the pairwise comparison matrix tables 8 11 and subjected to the defuzzification process equation 7 by the normalized weights of the main criteria g 1 i g 4 i and according to equations 11 13 3 results 3 1 fhap analysis three variants of solutions for the operation of the small hydropower plant were proposed the solutions differed in increasing the level of damming variant 1 alternative a 1 increasing the damming level by 10 cm variant 2 alternative a 2 increasing the damming level by 20 cm variant 3 alternative a 3 increasing the damming level by 30 cm the conducted analyses allowed for developing ratings for individual variants alternatives in relation to the analysed criteria the adopted ratings are summarized in table 6 developing a pairwise comparison matrix can be troublesome in some cases this may happen because some information necessary in the decision making process may be imprecise or unknown another factor influencing the decision making process and consequently the final ranking may be the difficulty that decision makers experts may experience when they try to correctly describe their preferences in relation to the pairs of compared criteria in case of problems with the determination of the pairwise comparison matrix it is advisable to use fuzzy ahp 83 96 for the purposes of the study an analysis was carried out using the modified ahp method fuzzy ahp as a basis for considerations the initial pairwise comparison matrices were adopted in the same way as for standard ahp which were then fuzzified according to table 5 5 fuzzy pairwise comparison matrices were obtained tables 7 11 the fuzzification factor δ 1 was adopted the analyses used the fuzzyahp package version 0 9 5 for r for the fuzzification of pairwise matrix and determination of local weight vectors w i w i 1 w i 2 w i 3 local weight vectors for fuzzy numbers were determined using equations 5 7 global weight vectors u k u k 1 u k 2 u k 3 table 12 were determined in accordance with equations 11 13 it should be noted that the obtained weight vector for middle fuzzy numbers coincides with the weight vector for the pure standard ahp method then the weights were subjected to the defuzzification process in accordance with formula 7 obtaining the final weight vector table 12 the final ranking table 13 was determined in accordance with equation 14 the final ranking has got very balanced values it shows a slight advantage of the a 1 variant approx 39 points over other variants a1 a2 a3 in comparison to other alternatives variant a1 provides the smallest increase in electricity generation by approx 100 mwh year and therefore the smallest increase in the revenue which of course results from the lowest increase in the level of damming in practice this translates into a co2 reduction of approx 86 000 kg co2 per year to give a more complete picture variant a3 will enable up to three times greater increase in electricity generation and reduction of co2 emissions compared to a1 however both variant a2 and variant a3 are characterised by higher costs related to the modernisation of the facility and its subsequent operation this is particularly important in the context of the age of the object over 100 years additionally high social pressure exerted by local farmers whose arable lands are in the vicinity of the embankments of the section of the river affected by the rosko damming barrage is expected if alternatives a2 and a3 are selected for implementation the position in the ranking was determined in particular by technical g3 13 6 and economic g1 10 criteria the g2 criterion in which the a1 variant obtained the same score as alternative a2 had by far the least impact on the ranking within the g1 criterion obviously the most favourable variant is a3 11 7 yet its advantage is not significant not more than 2 points alternative a3 also gains a lot in terms of the g4 criterion due to a very large reduction of co2 however in each of the remaining groups of criteria it turned out to be the least favourable variant achieving even three times lower values than the optimal alternative for the technical criterion g3 when it comes to safety issues k8 alternative a1 turns out to be the best option the a 1 scenario gains a decisive advantage in the case of the g3 criteria technical criteria even three times more than other alternatives 3 2 sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis of the model was also performed 100 wt vectors w g in the range 0 1 only for the group of main criteria g1 g4 were randomly generated fig 8 in each iteration the global weights were obtained by multiplying the local weights of the k 1 i k 13 i c r i t e r i a tables 8 11 previously obtained for the pairwise comparison matrix and subjected to the defuzzification process equation 7 by the normalized weights of the main criteria g 1 i g 4 i according to equations 10 13 the sensitivity analysis shows that the ranking is very stable and in practically every iteration it was in line with the previously obtained results for alternatives a1 a2 a3 alternative a1 obtained the averaged ranking point value 40 28 median 40 56 sd 3 5028 and it was 96 times positioned as the first 4 times as the second and never as the third alternative a2 with the averaged point value 31 91 median 31 88 sd 1 08 was ranked 96 times as the first fig 10 4 times as the first and the third whereas alternative a3 with the averaged point value 27 82 median 27 94 sd 3 07 was 92 times positioned as the third 8 times as the second the notches surrounding the median in fig 9 indicate that differences in the medians of alternatives ai are essential the notches show 95 confidence intervals for the medians and the distance of irq n0 5interquartile range around the median 97 it can also be noticed that alternative a2 is characterized by the lowest point dispersion in the ranking the significantly greater point dispersion in the ranking for alternatives a1 and a3 results from the changes in the weights of the main criteria g1 and g4 and their relation to the weights of other criteria alternative a3 receives a high rating for g1 and g4 criteria 4 discussion the study analysed the impact of damming changes on the operation of a small hydroelectric power plant a series of simulations using fahp were carried out in order to determine the optimal variant of the damming change to the operation of the analysed hydropower facility the analyses took into account 13 criteria which were divided into four basic groups related to economic technical legal and socio environmental issues both fahp and the sensitivity analysis indicate that the most optimal variant in the light of the adopted criteria is the a1 variant which stands out in terms of technical criteria and is characterised by good ranking results in other main criteria the obtained rankings are stable practically in each iteration of the sensitivity analysis alternative a1 turned out to be the most optimal the most optimal alternative a1 will increase electricity generation by 108 78 mwh annually while reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 86000 kg co2 it is worth emphasising however that this is the variant leading to the smallest annual increase in power production and reduction of co2 emissions nevertheless the applied methodology shows that this variant has the best chance of implementation taking into consideration economic legal and social factors it will give the investor facility operator a chance to avoid a failed implementation of an unrealistic scenario assuming an increase in the shp s efficiency vassoney 98 analysed the possibility of using decision making tools such as multi criteria decision making methods mcdm in aosta valley nw italy to define an optimal environmental flow scenario to be released by pumped storage plants also to balance the needs of energy production economic profitability and environmental protection for this purpose they considered the impact of four criteria energy environment and fisheries landscape economy in their analyses they applied seven different mcdm methods to the existing small flow power plant i e saw wpm ahp topsis vikor electre iii and share mca they obtained a very good correlation between the share mca saw wpm ahp and topsis methods whereas vikor and electre iii produced different results not only in ranking but also in format however the authors indicated that when it comes to the number of criteria and alternatives ahp is subject to certain limitations a large number of items to be compared in pairs may reduce the consistency of rankings made by decision makers finally ahp requires the highest level of user interaction who are asked to perform several pairwise comparisons for each level of the hierarchical structure on the other hand in ahp alternatives can be compared in pairs even with reference to a qualitative criterion using the saaty s fundamental scale the literature offers numerous publications describing the use of mcda methods including ahp and fahp that are applied to select the optimal location of shps 34 35 38 99 as most of the environmental and social problems associated with hydropower production are directly related to their location it is important to consider economic social and environmental criteria when selecting a hydropower site accordingly the decision making process must take into account both qualitative and quantitative factors 99 the use of multi criteria methods including ahp and fahp is an excellent solution that allows scientists and decision makers to select optimal locations for the construction of hydropower plants while taking into account important economic social and environmental criteria the location and operation of shp on a global basis as a network of small power plants may also be optimized 37 38 100 when there are difficulties in developing a pairwise comparison matrix i e difficulties in defining clearly precise defined preference values by experts or decision makers the fuzzy set theory and fuzzy ahp 76 can be successfully applied which makes the evaluation results more reasonable and comprehensive 77 the parameterisation of decision models is associated with many uncertainties related to i e imprecise data and problems with the correct development of pairwise comparison matrices in order to fully assess the project the analyses should take into account not only a quantitative approach economic or technical but also qualitative often difficult to measure values such as the values of natural resources or environmental protection 101 the imprecision and uncertainty of the decision model and the preferences of experts can be taken into account by introducing fuzzy numbers and for instance fuzzy ahp the usefulness of this approach was confirmed by ref 29 who compared the use of fuzzy ahp and topsis in flood polder planning methods they indicated that despite some differences both methods with common goals are similar and such tools should always be used in decision support system dss fuzzy ahp can be considered more flexible and reliable for the assessment of water management plans 102 also under conditions of uncertainty 103 a certain type of validation of the analyses carried out is the current status of the request for a change in the damming level the administrator of the river and damming structures does not agree to discuss any change in the damming level above 0 1 m i e the a1 variant the main concern expressed by the representatives of the administrator are the safety issues of the damming barrage which in their opinion are difficult to fully analyse due to the age of the damming structure and the deficiencies in its technical documentation the activity of the local community has also increased whose representatives express the opinion that the existing state should not change and from the moment of obtaining information on the proposed changes they often monitor the damming level on the rosko barrage the above factors were considered in this analysis as highly weighted destimulants and proved to be decisive in determining the final ranking of the proposed alternatives 5 conclusions the authors of the article proposed a methodology for assessing the operation of shps and supporting decision making processes when it is necessary to change the operation regime of a small hydropower plant due to for instance changes in its hydrological conditions when performing analyses it is important to consider not only the economic aspects of projects but also other values that are often difficult to measure i e the value of natural resources legal conditions and requirements or a social situation the proposed criteria and sub criteria can be easily adapted to the specificity of a given facility and the use of fuzzy logic will successfully eliminate the emerging difficulties with developing a pairwise comparison matrix consequently it is possible to overcome the difficulties with identifying evident clearly defined preference values by experts decision makers which will make evaluation results more reasonable and comprehensive also the authors proposed a sensitivity analysis procedure that enables the estimation of model stability and the resulting ranking of alternatives the article proposes an optimisation model thanks to which it was possible to choose the optimal change of the shp work regime so as to simultaneously increase the production of green energy thus limiting the emission of co2 to the atmosphere at the same time the model provided the best chance for implementation particularly in the context of the operational safety of accompanying facilities as well as administrative legal and social realities in the country of location of a small hydropower plant shp the proposed a1 variant will enable to increase electricity production by approx 110 mwh per year with a simultaneous reduction of co2 emissions by 86 000 kg which in the situation of high costs of raw materials for conventional energy or their limited availability for instance due to the geopolitical context is particularly desirable variant a1 with the highest chance of success proved not necessarily the most economically viable option however this was determined by non economic criteria in particular technical criteria related to safety issues of the existing 100 year old facility and the possible need to extend the technical infrastructure which in this case would be the smallest of the three alternatives analysed the sensitivity analysis for the 100 random vectors of weights of the main criteria g1 g4 shows the stability of the ranking alternative a1 received a mean score of 40 28 median 40 56 sd 3 5028 in the rankings and was ranked first 96 times in more than 90 of the situations analysed alternative a3 was ranked third despite being the most economically optimal again non economic criteria proved to be more important in particular construction safety when deciding on the construction and operation as well as the modernisation of facilities especially where the safety of both the facility and the associated infrastructure and surroundings is crucial economic criteria should not be decisive when making decisions tools and methods should be used to solve complex and complicated decision making problems in which both quantitative and qualitative aspects of the problem are taken into account one such method is the fahp method which unlike the classic ahp method makes it possible to eliminate the difficulty of developing a matrix of pairwise comparisons and defining clear explicit preferences by experts and decision makers any analysis using the ahp fahp method should also be complemented by as extensive a sensitivity analysis as possible this makes it possible to dynamically change the importance of individual criteria and to observe the impact of these changes on the final rankings and thus estimate the model s stability it also makes it possible to identify those criteria subcriteria whose change sometimes independent of the investor may cause significant changes in the ranking and thus influence the choice of the optimal alternative the proposed methodology can be easily used for the analysis and optimisation of other shp objects taking into account of course the local conditions of a given object credit authorship contribution statement ireneusz laks investigation conceptualization methodology writing
