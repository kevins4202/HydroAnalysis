11790,groundwater the world s largest freshwater resource is critically important for global food security excessive groundwater extraction has led to issues such as groundwater sustainability scarcity and stress various indices have been developed for assessing them the selection of the right index for the assessment is very important therefore the existing index based groundwater scarcity stress and sustainability methods were reviewed to rank the indices based on scientific criteria to identify the gaps in the literature and propose a way to bridge them analysis of the review revealed that indices based on drivers pressures state impact response and aggregation methods for groundwater sustainability were likely to yield more realistic outcomes and facilitated better planning of groundwater related issues based on the criteria ranking the groundwater stress index based on the groundwater footprint methodology secured the relatively uppermost rank for future development this study proposed an index by coupling two existing indices of the groundwater footprint family to get more realistic outcomes one deals with the quantity and quality of groundwater and the other with quantity only but at a more detailed sub system level it combines the advantages of the two indices of which it is composed while minimizing their shortcomings graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater scarcity groundwater stress groundwater sustainability ranking 1 introduction water is one of the basic needs of mankind variations in water resources have direct repercussions on society fao 2012 water is absolutely necessary for sustainable development thus the united nations recognized ensuring water security for everyone as one of the 17 sustainable development goals sdgs goal 6 unsdsn 2013 total freshwater available on the earth in the form of liquid is mainly categorized into two classes surface water and groundwater which are about 2 and 98 respectively margat and van der gun 2013 globally 35 of total water withdrawal for human use comes from groundwater for irrigation domestic and industrial use groundwater contributes 42 36 and 27 respectively döll et al 2012 dependence on groundwater is more intense where surface water is scarce obvious examples are hyper arid and arid regions that mainly depend upon groundwater resources to sustain human activities bhakar and singh 2018 rijsberman 2006 the rapid increase in socioeconomic conditions in society changes in land use and climate are the key factors responsible for the over exploitation of groundwater that can cause the depletion of groundwater resources foster et al 2013 kundzewicz and döll 2009 genxu et al 2005 in addition to the over utilization of groundwater another growing concern is groundwater quality degradation haritash et al 2016 the depletion and quality degradation of groundwater resources may lead to problems of groundwater sustainability scarcity and stress which are explained below groundwater sustainability is defined as the maintenance and protection of groundwater and related ecosystems to balance current and future environmental economic and social requirements gordon groundwater consultancy 2011 technically water stress and scarcity are two different terms different scientists have defined water stress and scarcity in different ways damkjaer and taylor 2017 schulte and morrison 2014 that is why a consortium of different well reputed water organizations has tried to standardize the definition of water related terms schulte and morrison 2014 according to schulte and morrison 2014 water scarcity deals only with the volumetric relationship between available water resources and human demand for water in an area however water stress deals with the ability of available water resources to meet human and ecological needs it considers other physical features of water resources viz water quantity quality and accessibility in other words water scarcity is a subset of water stress however sometimes the scientific community uses water stress as a synonym for water scarcity pereira et al 2002 van loon and van lanen 2013 different groundwater indices the term groundwater indices will be used generically when referring to all the indices viz groundwater scarcity stress and sustainability together have been developed to estimate groundwater scarcity stress and sustainability however it is still an ongoing process and multiple groundwater indices are available based on different methodologies scope and applicability the availability of multiple groundwater indices creates confusion among the policymakers to choose the right one for their needs steinemann et al 2015 according to the best knowledge of the authors there is no specific guidance available to help the policymakers in choosing a suitable groundwater index a couple of review studies have been conducted on the topic of groundwater sustainability a review by elshall et al 2020 outlined the concept and evolution of groundwater sustainability within science and emerging policies and highlighted the gaps between science and policy another review conducted by gleeson et al 2020 discussed three points the first was the importance and threats to groundwater resources and sustainability the second was to explain the connection of groundwater with various parts of the earth system finally the importance of examining groundwater on a global scale was discussed recently a review study assessed the vulnerability of groundwater based on modeling approaches and indices goyal et al 2021 discussed the vulnerability of groundwater based on the drastic depth to the water table net recharge aquifer properties soil properties topography impact of vadose zone and hydraulic conductivity index and compared the numerical and indices based methodologies and discussed their pros and cons different methods of groundwater vulnerability are also discussed by kumar et al 2015 the focus of the above reviews was on groundwater sustainability and vulnerability moreover they did not provide direction to the policymakers in the selection of the most suitable index based on their needs therefore the novelty of this study discusses the index based groundwater stress groundwater scarcity and groundwater sustainability methodologies ranking the existing indices and indicating the existing gaps therefore the objectives of this review were set as the following a review of groundwater indices along with pros and cons and explaining their application prioritizing the existing groundwater indices based on different criteria identification of existing gaps in the literature and proposing an index to bridge the existing gaps to minimize the uncertainty this study can be helpful for policymakers to choose the right index from a set of existing groundwater indices according to their requirements a detailed explanation of every step is given in the latter part the methodology for ranking the existing indices is expressed in section 2 overview and the application of the existing indices are expressed in section 3 and the conclusion and future direction are given in section 4 2 materials and methods this review was based on a thorough examination of previous literature in order to determine the present status of the development of groundwater indices using various approaches to preserve the review s quality peer reviewed articles were given priority in the review of the literature secondly reports from well reputable international organizations on sustainability stress and groundwater scarcity were examined moreover some other sources of information online sources departmental reports and so on were utilized to support the storyline the advantages and disadvantages of each groundwater index as well as the application of each index were thoroughly examined then the existing groundwater indices were ranked based on different criteria the groundwater indices identified in the literature were selected based on a variety of criteria to assist policymakers in selecting the appropriate index as mentioned in section 2 1 five criteria along with the corresponding sub criteria were utilized for the prioritization of existing indices finally research gaps in the literature were identified and an index was proposed to address them the proposed index could provide more comprehensive accurate and realistic groundwater stress insight 2 1 selection of criteria and sub criteria based prioritization to avoid ambiguity in the selection of the most appropriate index among various options a framework for ranking has been provided for the user to select the most appropriate index based on their needs groundwater indices were ranked based on five criteria tractability sophistication scientific robustness extendibility and transparency along with their corresponding sub criteria these criteria were chosen based on recommendations in the literature for evaluating an index wable et al 2019 keyantash and dracup 2002 castro et al 2018 steinemann et al 2015 for each criterion a score from one to five was assigned to all the groundwater indices analyzed in this article the weighted average of scores against each criterion was used to determine the overall ranking of each index under consideration furthermore the scores were assigned based on criteria using a qualitative evaluation of groundwater parameters found in the literature 2 1 1 criteria and sub criteria the definitions of each criterion and sub criteria are listed in this section and a detailed explanation of each criterion and their sub criteria and the respective scores are given in table 1 2 1 1 1 tractability it is concerned with the simplicity with which a mathematical solution can be obtained the tractability of a groundwater index depends upon multiple factors that can be defined as sub criteria of tractability wable et al 2019 the average of its sub criteria scores are used to determine the tractability score the explanation of the sub criteria of tractability is as follows computational level deals with the ease to get the outcome of the mathematical model if the computation can be done accurately with basic mathematical skills then it is scored a maximum on a scale from 1 to 5 on the other hand if a complex mathematical model needs to be used to get the output of an index and even then the outcome has some uncertainties then it was designated the minimum score data availability refers to the ease of data acquisition for an index the maximum score is given to the groundwater index against this sub criterion if the data is available in worldwide databases without any further need for processing and is freely available if the data need to be collected with the help of a survey then it was assigned the minimum score number of parameters refers to the number of parameters involved in the development of an index the assigned score was maximum to an index if the number of parameters in an index was less than three on the other hand if the number of parameters involved in an index is more than ten then the assigned score was minimum 2 1 1 2 sophistication it is a measure of the comprehensiveness of the groundwater index based on the theory that underpins its development keyantash and dracup 2002 this criterion is further broken down into three subcategories the average of the three sub criteria is used to get the score of this criterion aspects involved refer to the characteristics involved in the groundwater index viz quantitative qualitative and socio economics characteristics if an index deals with every aspect viz groundwater quantity quality and socio economics of an area then the maximum score is assigned to that index however if an index deals with the groundwater quantity withdrawal and availability even without considering the contribution of groundwater to the environmental flow then the lowest score is assigned geographical scale deals with the geographical scope of an index in other words it refers to the geographical applicability of an index the highest score is given if the index is applicable worldwide and takes care of local details at the hydrological response unit hru level on the other hand the index is assigned the lowest score if it is applicable to only a certain type of geographical location and does not incorporate local details of an aquifer temporal scale reflects the temporal coverage of an index the index is ranked at the topmost position if the groundwater index represents the variation on a monthly basis the lowest score is assigned if the groundwater index does not specify the temporal resolution 2 1 1 3 scientific robustness scientific robustness relates to the reliability of the index within the scientific community castro et al 2018 reliability is assessed based on recognition by the scientific community if the index has been published in peer reviewed journals and further positive discussion has been done by the scientific community review then it is given a high score however the index is given the lowest score if it has been published only in grey literature 2 1 1 4 transparency this criterion is used for the communication of scientific results for upstream midstream and downstream audiences and how a threshold of an index is defined keyantash and dracup 2002 here the upstream midstream and downstream audiences are scientists decision makers and the general public respectively the highest score is assigned to the index if it is easy to understand for both the scientific community decision makers and the general public as well and also has defined threshold values along with levels of severity very low high extreme etc on the other hand the lowest score is designated if an index is difficult to understand overall its threshold value is not properly defined and the levels of level of severity are not given 2 1 1 5 extendibility it is the degree to which the index may be extended across time to predict or forecast future scenarios thus the extendibility of an index is primarily dependent upon the availability of the historical and the generation of future data used for the development of an index the highest score is given to an index if the availability of historical data and the future data projection are easy the lowest score is given if the historical data availability and projection are difficult 3 an overview of groundwater indices this section comprises a review of the existing groundwater indices groundwater indices can be divided into three classes a general groundwater scarcity and stress b groundwater footprint and c groundwater sustainability indices with the help of the review the advantages and disadvantages of each index are discussed 3 1 groundwater scarcity and stress indices in this section general groundwater scarcity and stress indices have been reviewed the reviewed indices were based on different methodologies and can be used for a variety of cases ranging from the initial to the detailed assessment of an aquifer or region 3 1 1 groundwater scarcity index the groundwater scarcity index ig is determined as the ratio of groundwater withdrawal gw to groundwater resources gr as expressed in equation 1 zeng et al 2013 1 i g g w g r 3 1 2 aquifer water scarcity index the aquifer water scarcity index awsi has been defined as the ratio of the actual groundwater abstraction minus the allowable abstraction and the actual abstraction each month sanginabadi et al 2019 the awsi is mathematically expressed in equation 2 2 awsi actual abstraction allowable abstraction actual abstraction the actual groundwater abstraction is the difference between naturalized and observed groundwater levels whereas the allowable groundwater abstraction is the difference between the naturalized groundwater level and the safe yield in fig 1 the observed groundwater level and naturalized groundwater level are represented with a solid line and dashed line respectively the red line is showing the average normal situation or threshold level 3 1 3 aquifer stress index asi six evaluation criteria viz water levels water quality groundwater pumping saltwater intrusion recharge and land use are aggregated to determine the aquifer stress index asia for each criterion a rating score and weight are used to evaluate the stress level somaratne 2019 the asia is mathematically expressed in equation 3 3 a s i a i 1 n w i r i where parameters r and w are the ratings and weights respectively assigned to each criterion i based on asia the aquifer is classified into five levels threshold limits and classifications of asia are given in detail in table 2 3 1 4 groundwater stress index based on withdrawal and recharge pfister et al 2009 developed an index to estimate the freshwater stress based on the annual freshwater withdrawals to hydrological availability ratio later on gomez and pfister 2012 modified it to obtain the groundwater stress index this groundwater stress index wsiwta is based on the annual average of groundwater withdrawal to groundwater recharge and is expressed as shown in equation 4 the plus point of this index is that it covers the temporal variability of the groundwater resources it is assumed that extreme water stress occurs when withdrawal exceeds than recharge 4 w s i w t a 1 1 99 e 3 84 w t a g w v f where wta gw is an average of groundwater withdrawal to groundwater recharge ratio and vf is the variation factor accounting for the temporal variability of water availability vf can be estimated as the aggregated measure of the dispersion of the multiplicative standard deviation of monthly s month and annual precipitation s year assuming a log normal distribution and considering precipitation data as expressed in equation 5 5 vf e ln s month 2 ln s year 2 3 1 5 groundwater stress index based on consumption and recharge the groundwater stress index wsicta can also be calculated based on groundwater consumption and recharge therefore it can be defined as the ratio of the mean annual groundwater consumption to groundwater recharge gomez and pfister 2012 consumption to recharge based water stress index is mathematically expressed in equation 6 groundwater consumption is equal to total groundwater withdrawal minus return flow from agricultural fields 6 w s i c t a 1 1 99 e 19 c t a g w v f where wsicta groundwater stress index based on groundwater consumption to recharge ratio cta gw mean annual groundwater consumption to groundwater recharge ratio vf variation factor accounting for the temporal variability of water availability 3 1 6 aquifer stress index aquifer stress index aqsi is expressed as the fraction of the available groundwater recharge used for human water use wada and heinrich 2013 the aqsi uses a concept similar to the groundwater footprint gf developed by gleeson et al 2012 but it is expressed as a dimensionless unit rather than the area m2 aqsi can be estimated by using equation 7 an aquifer is considered under stress conditions if the aqsi 1 7 aqsi gw a r nat r irri r env where gwa is the groundwater abstraction for human water use rnat is the natural groundwater recharge rirri is the groundwater recharge by the agriculture return flow and renv is the groundwater contribution to the environmental flow 3 1 7 droughtwater scarcity index sanginabadi et al 2019 proposed a new index namely the droughtwater scarcity dws index by combining two existing indices standardized groundwater index and the deficit rate by using the proposed index it is possible to monitor both phenomena drought and water scarcity simultaneously and determine the individual impact of natural and artificial factors on an aquifer s hydrological condition the dws index is mathematically expressed in equation 8 8 dws log n 1 d klog n 2 s where dws is the droughtwater scarcity index and it is unitless d is drought severity indicated by the standardized groundwater index and the value of d can be determined by using equation 9 kubicz 2018 bloomfield et al 2015 saghafian and sanginabadi 2020 s is the severity of water scarcity indicated by the deficit rate and the water deficit rate is mathematically defined below in equation 10 moreover k is a positive number that indicates the importance of water deficit in relation to drought the value of k is assumed to be 2 based on previous studies n1 is the number of drought conditions and n2 is the number of water scarcity conditions threshold limits and classifications of droughtwater scarcity are given in detail in table 2 9 d f d μ δ where d is the standardized groundwater index and it is unitless f d is the normalized value of the measured groundwater level μ is the average value of the normalized groundwater level and δ is the standard deviation of the normalized groundwater level the deficit rate is the ratio of the groundwater shortage and the groundwater demand the deficit rate is a unitless index huang and chou 2005 as expressed below in equation 10 10 deficit rate groundwater shortage groundwater demand 3 2 water stress indices based on groundwater footprint the water footprint network used the concept of water footprint that aims to account for the water productivity of global freshwater as a limited resource marrison and schulte 2010 farooq and gheewala 2019 the water footprint of an individual community or business is defined as the total volume of freshwater that is used to produce the goods and services consumed by the individual or community or produced by the business vanham and bidoglio 2013 groundwater stress can be estimated by using the groundwater footprint concept 3 2 1 groundwater footprint index groundwater footprint gf introduced in 2012 is defined as the area required to sustain groundwater use and groundwater dependent ecosystem services of an aquifer or watershed etc gleeson et al 2012 gleeson and wada 2013 kourgialas et al 2018 the groundwater footprint can be estimated based on equation 11 the ratio of groundwater footprint to aquifer area gf a has been used for the groundwater stress index nayyeri et al 2020 pérez et al 2019 as expressed in equation 12 11 gf a c r e where gf is the groundwater footprint m2 c is the area averaged annual abstraction of groundwater m day r is the recharge rate m day e is the groundwater contribution to environmental streamflow m day and a is the areal extent of any region of interest given in m2 12 gf a c r e gf a 1 indicates unsustainable groundwater consumption that could affect groundwater availability and gf a 1 indicates unsustainable groundwater mining often groundwater recharged under past climatic conditions a ratio of gf a 1 represents sustainable groundwater extraction gleeson et al 2012 3 2 2 integrated groundwater footprint index integrated groundwater footprint igf a was developed by incorporating water quality into the groundwater footprint kourgialas et al 2018 groundwater stress can be estimated through the igf a as expressed in equation 13 it can be summarized that the gleeson et al 2012 methodology underestimates the groundwater stress value in cases where there are also significant water quality issues 13 igf gf 1 n cf 1 a 1 a cf 2 a 2 a cf n a n a where igf is integrated groundwater footprint n is the number of contaminants in the system and cf is 1 n contamination factor for contaminant j with j 1 n if the concentration of a specific contaminant j is above a certain threshold set as the maximum allowable concentration of the contaminant in drinking water as defined by the world health organization who then cfj is considered equal to 1 active otherwise it is considered as zero inactive 3 2 3 groundwater footprint index at sub systems level groundwater footprint assessment has been proposed at the sub system level by chen et al 2020 three parameters of groundwater footprint the average annual abstraction of groundwater c recharge rate r and groundwater contribution to environmental streamflow e are estimated at the sub system level the estimation of recharge r at the sub system level is obtained by adding the groundwater recharge from rainfall recharge rr river leakage recharge rl canal return supply rc lateral inflow rli and leakage yield rly as expressed in equation 14 the unit of these terms is m day 14 r r r r i r c r li r ly the estimation of groundwater consumption c at the sub system level can be obtained by the summation of deep groundwater consumption cd and shallow groundwater consumption cs as expressed in equation 15 shallow groundwater consumption is obtained by adding the shallow groundwater withdrawal csgw diving evaporation cde phreatic labeled evaporation cple lateral outflow clo and leakage yield cly deep groundwater consumption is obtained by adding the exploitation of deep groundwater cdgw lateral outflow clo and leakage yield cly as expressed in equation 16 the unit of groundwater consumption is m day 15 c c d c s 16 c c sgw c de c ple c lo c ly c dgw c lo c ly e is the groundwater s contribution to the environmental streamflow and its unit is m day and it can be obtained at the sub systemic level by using equation 17 17 e 100 μ a δ h n where μ is the degree of water supply of the aquifer to the environment a is the area δh is the duration of groundwater recovery from the current level to the original level and n is the recovery period is assumed thirty years groundwater footprint can be assessed at the sub system level by substituting the values of r c and e from 14 16 and 17 respectively into equation 12 the advantage of this method is to estimate the parameters of groundwater footprint at the sub system level which is not possible through other methods based on gf a groundwater over recovery levels and aquifer health ratings are detailed in table 3 3 3 groundwater sustainability index in this category five groundwater sustainability indices are discussed based on aggregating indicators drivers pressures state impact response dpsir method reliability resilience vulnerability rrv method modified rrv method and blue groundwater sustainability index bgwsi 3 3 1 groundwater sustainability index based on aggregating indicators individual indicators are collected into a single index based on an underlying model of the multidimensional concept being measured to create a composite indicator rovan 2011 guidelines on dealing with technical issues such as data selection imputation normalization and aggregation during the construction of composite indicators have been provided by nardo et al 2008 composite indicators have been used by hydrologists as well to evaluate groundwater sustainability for example singh and bhakar 2020 pandey et al 2011 and bui et al 2019 applied groundwater sustainability index gsia based on aggregating indicators gsia is very flexible it can be applied even in the area facing data scarcity issues the gsia is obtained by aggregating the value of each indicator and its attributed weight pandey et al 2011 to represent the gsia from 0 to 1 scale is used 1 represents the highest degree of sustainability while 0 represents the worst degree of sustainability and 0 5 represents the threshold value 3 3 2 groundwater sustainability index based on the dpsir method the dpsir approach was formally developed by the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd to assess sustainability alexakis 2021 this approach has often been used to assess groundwater sustainability gsid jia et al 2019 li et al 2011 for example borji et al 2018 discussed the different types of indicators related to each category of dpsir different indicators related to each category are shown in fig 2 jia et al 2019 the gsid is calculated by taking the weighted average of indicators values related to each category wang et al 2020 3 3 3 groundwater sustainability index based on rrv method the sustainability of a groundwater system can also be defined as a function of performance indicators reliability resilience and vulnerability loucks 1997 in the case of groundwater resources reliability is defined as how frequently the system would be in the satisfactory domain resilience is defined as the likelihood of groundwater storage recovering to its normal position after an event resiliency indicates how quickly a system returns to a satisfactory condition after an unsatisfactory event vulnerability is defined as a probabilistic measure that accounts for the extent and magnitude of failure thomas 2019 mays 2013 hashimoto et al 1982 the relative sustainability of the system with respect to each of these criteria is higher when the reliability and resilience are greater and the vulnerability is smaller mathematical expressions of reliability resilience and vulnerability are given in equations 18 20 respectively all these three performance indicators are unitless 18 reliability number of satisfactory conditions total number of conditions 19 resilience number of times a satisfactory condition follows an unsatisfactory condition total number of unsatisfactory conditions 20 vulnerability f s j p j where s j refers to the magnitude of the event p j refers to the probability of the severity of the magnitude during the study period and f is the average failure of the groundwater system groundwater sustainability index gsirrv based on reliability resilience and vulnerability can be calculated as given in equation 21 wang et al 2019 thomas et al 2017 thomas 2019 to represent the gsirrv from 0 to 1 scale is used 0 gsirrv 0 2 means extremely unsustainable gsirrv 0 5 is a threshold limit below which gsirrv is unsustainable and 0 75 gsirrv 1 means highly sustainable 21 gsi rrv rel res 1 vul 3 3 4 groundwater sustainability index based on modified rrv method the groundwater sustainability index mgsirrv based rrv method was modified by sandoval et al 2011 in the modified method geometric mean is used as given in equation 22 rather than a simple multiplication of the performance indicators rrv sandoval et al 2011 mays 2013 pedro monzonís et al 2015 ahmed et al 2019 if a certain water user has 50 performance each for reliability resilience and vulnerability then the groundwater sustainability calculated with gsirrv and mgsirrv are 13 and 50 respectively that shows the mgsirrv yields a more reasonable estimate of groundwater sustainability as compared to the gsirrv the remaining pros and cons are the same as the previously discussed index 22 mgsi rrv rel res 1 vul 1 3 3 3 5 blue groundwater sustainability index the bgwsi is the ratio of the nonrenewable groundwater abstraction nrgwa and consumptive blue groundwater use cbgwu wada and bierkens 2014 blue groundwater sustainability index can be determined by using cbgwu and nrgwa as expressed in equation 23 the cbgwu is the sum of groundwater consumption used by livestock irrigation domestic and industrial sectors the term nrgwa is used when the abstraction of groundwater is more than the recharge 23 bgwsi nrgw a cbgwu a summary of the characteristics pros and cons and applicability of groundwater indices are given in table 4 after the review it was found that most of the indices do not define the role of modernization climate change impacts groundwater contribution to environmental flow 1 1 environmental flows are defined as the quantity timing and quality of freshwater flows and levels necessary to sustain aquatic ecosystems that in turn support human cultures economies sustainable livelihoods and well being arthington et al 2018 groundwater recharge from the river canal open channels and other irrigation structures a few indices incorporated groundwater quality as an indicator these above mentioned drawbacks can limit the applicability of these methodologies worldwide and the advantages of the indices can make them favorable for some particular areas therefore the applicability of each index under review is mentioned in the next section each groundwater index has its own characteristics range of applications pros and cons however some characteristics range of applications pros and cons are the same among groundwater indices which can confuse policymakers to choose the most suitable index based on the available resources characteristics range of applications pros and cons therefore this issue was addressed by ranking the groundwater indices based on five different criteria the qualitative assessment of each index was done by passing through each criterion using a scale of one to five for lowest and highest scores respectively the groundwater footprint index defined by gleeson et al 2012 secured the highest score based on the five criteria under consideration the groundwater stress index based on consumption to recharge defined by gomez and pfister 2012 and the groundwater stress index based on withdrawal to recharge defined by gomez and pfister 2012 shared the second rank on the other hand the aquifer water scarcity index defined by sanginabadi et al 2019 based on criteria for the groundwater scarcity assessment was the least prioritized index because of lower tractability sophistication and transparency as compared to the other groundwater indices under consideration the score of each groundwater index against each criterion sub criterion is given in table 5 4 conclusion groundwater is a crucial resource for the socio economic development of our societies thus this study evaluated different index based methodologies to examine the issues related to groundwater scarcity stress and sustainability in any area region the selection of a suitable groundwater index is vital for accurate assessment followed by the development of effective strategies for the mitigation of groundwater related issues scarcity stress etc to get realistic outcomes and better planning indices based on drivers pressures state impact response dpsir and aggregation methods for groundwater sustainability can be recommended to get more realistic outcomes and better plaining groundwater related issues across the globe considering the five criteria of tractability sophistication scientific robustness extendibility and transparency the groundwater footprint index gf had the highest rank it is the best in tractability scientific robustness and extendibility and is second best in transparency as compared to the other exiting groundwater indices however the policymakers can also choose the most suitable index for their specific needs ease of use comprehensive etc based on the results of this study as provided in table 5 a new index was proposed by combining the two existing indices to minimize the uncertainty in the groundwater stress assessment this study proposed a modified groundwater footprint mgf index for assessing groundwater stress by coupling the methodologies of integrated groundwater footprint index igf a and groundwater footprint index at subsystem level gfs the igf a covers quality aspects along with quantity but accuracy lacks the accuracy can be obtained by using gfs but it does not cover the quality aspect of groundwater the mgf provides the advantages of both indices gfs and igf a in one and overcomes the shortcomings of both existing indices therefore the results of mgf can be more comprehensive and accurate than the existing ones moreover the igf used who standards for water quality in the groundwater stress estimation applying the who drinking water standards for water quality especially in the aquifer where the main user is agriculture is not appropriate using the who standards for the agricultural dominant aquifer can cause an overestimation of groundwater stress to avoid this problem it is recommended that fao standards should be used in the agrarian dominant aquifer the threshold values of different contamination of drinking water can be accessed through the who platform and irrigation water quality standards based on fao can be accessed from the fao platform however the drawbacks of the proposed index are the large data requirement and expertise required for the computation which may be a concern for developing countries this drawback can be overcome by generating the data with the help of numerical modeling a good water scarcity index should deal with water quantity quality and environmental flow the mgf index can also be a meaningful addition to the list of lca based water stress indices because it carries all the qualities of a good water stress index the proposed mgf index can also be very helpful for policymakers to assess groundwater stress with more accuracy and inclusiveness policymakers of water management agriculture and water conservation departments can use the mgf index to cope with water stress issues the proposed index can be more useful where the river density is high rich in flora and fauna and dependence on groundwater is high as well however in future work it is recommended to incorporate the physical and economic accessibility indicators in the future development of the groundwater stress index because lack of accessibility to water can create difficulty in water use and thus influence water stress here the indicator accessibility refers to the level of ease to access the groundwater declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper

study proposed an index by coupling two existing indices of the groundwater footprint family to get more realistic outcomes one deals with the quantity and quality of groundwater and the other with quantity only but at a more detailed sub system level it combines the advantages of the two indices of which it is composed while minimizing their shortcomings graphical abstract image 1 keywords

groundwater scarcity stress and sustainability however it is still an ongoing process and multiple groundwater indices are available based on different methodologies scope and applicability the availability of multiple groundwater indices creates confusion among the policymakers to choose the right one for their needs steinemann et al 2015 according to the best knowledge of the authors there is no specific guidance available to help the policymakers in choosing a suitable groundwater index a couple of review studies have been conducted on the topic of groundwater sustainability a review by elshall et al 2020 outlined the concept and evolution of groundwater sustainability within science and emerging policies and highlighted the gaps between science and policy another review conducted by gleeson et al 2020 discussed three points the first was the importance and threats to groundwater resources and sustainability the second was to explain the connection of groundwater with various parts of the earth system finally the importance of examining groundwater on a global scale was discussed recently a review study assessed the vulnerability of groundwater based on modeling approaches and indices goyal et al 2021 discussed the vulnerability of groundwater based on the drastic depth to the water table net recharge aquifer properties soil properties topography impact of vadose zone and hydraulic conductivity index and compared the numerical and indices based methodologies and discussed their pros and cons different methods of groundwater vulnerability are also discussed by kumar et al 2015 the focus of the above reviews was on groundwater sustainability and vulnerability moreover they did not provide direction to the policymakers in the selection of the most suitable index based on their needs therefore the novelty of this study discusses the index based groundwater stress groundwater scarcity and groundwater sustainability methodologies ranking the existing indices and indicating the existing gaps therefore the objectives of this review were set as the following a review of groundwater indices along with pros and cons and explaining their application prioritizing the existing groundwater indices based on different criteria identification of existing gaps in the literature and proposing an index to bridge the existing gaps to minimize the uncertainty this study can be helpful for policymakers to choose the right index from a set of existing groundwater indices according to their requirements a detailed explanation of every step is given in the latter part the methodology for ranking the existing indices is expressed in section 2 overview and the application of the existing indices are expressed in section 3 and the conclusion and future direction are given in section 4 2 materials and methods this review was based on a thorough examination of previous literature in order to determine the present status of the development of groundwater indices using various approaches to preserve the review s quality peer reviewed articles were given priority in the review of the literature secondly reports from well reputable international organizations on sustainability stress and groundwater scarcity were examined moreover some other sources of information online sources departmental reports and so on were utilized to support the storyline the advantages and disadvantages of each groundwater index as well as the application of each index were thoroughly examined then the existing groundwater indices were ranked based on different criteria the groundwater indices identified in the literature were selected based on a variety of criteria to assist policymakers in selecting the appropriate index as mentioned in section 2 1 five criteria along with the corresponding sub criteria were utilized for the prioritization of existing indices finally research gaps in the literature were identified and an index was proposed to address them the proposed index could provide more comprehensive accurate and realistic groundwater stress insight 2 1 selection of criteria and sub criteria based prioritization to avoid ambiguity in the selection of the most appropriate index among various options a framework for ranking has been provided for the user to select the most appropriate index based on their needs groundwater indices were ranked based on five criteria tractability sophistication scientific robustness extendibility and transparency along with their corresponding sub criteria these criteria were chosen based on recommendations in the literature for evaluating an index wable et al 2019 keyantash and dracup 2002 castro et al 2018 steinemann et al 2015 for each criterion a score from one to five was assigned to all the groundwater indices analyzed in this article the weighted average of scores against each criterion was used to determine the overall ranking of each index under consideration furthermore the scores were assigned based on criteria using a qualitative evaluation of groundwater parameters found in the literature 2 1 1 criteria and sub criteria the definitions of each criterion and sub criteria are listed in this section and a detailed explanation of each criterion and their sub criteria and the respective scores are given in table 1 2 1 1 1 tractability it is concerned with the simplicity with which a mathematical solution can be obtained the tractability of a groundwater index depends upon multiple factors that can be defined as sub criteria of tractability wable et al 2019 the average of its sub criteria scores are used to determine the tractability score the explanation of the sub criteria of tractability is as follows computational level deals with the ease to get the outcome of the mathematical model if the computation can be done accurately with basic mathematical skills then it is scored a maximum on a scale from 1 to 5 on the other hand if a complex mathematical model needs to be used to get the output of an index and even then the outcome has some uncertainties then it was designated the minimum score data availability refers to the ease of data acquisition for an index the maximum score is given to the groundwater index against this sub criterion if the data is available in worldwide databases without any further need for processing and is freely available if the data need to be collected with the help of a survey then it was assigned the minimum score number of parameters refers to the number of parameters involved in the development of an index the assigned score was maximum to an index if the number of parameters in an index was less than three on the other hand if the number of parameters involved in an index is more than ten then the assigned score was minimum 2 1 1 2 sophistication it is a measure of the comprehensiveness of the groundwater index based on the theory that underpins its development keyantash and dracup 2002 this criterion is further broken down into three subcategories the average of the three sub criteria is used to get the score of this criterion aspects involved refer to the characteristics involved in the groundwater index viz quantitative qualitative and socio economics characteristics if an index deals with every aspect viz groundwater quantity quality and socio economics of an area then the maximum score is assigned to that index however if an index deals with the groundwater quantity withdrawal and availability even without considering the contribution of groundwater to the environmental flow then the lowest score is assigned geographical scale deals with the geographical scope of an index in other words it refers to the geographical applicability of an index the highest score is given if the index is applicable worldwide and takes care of local details at the hydrological response unit hru level on the other hand the index is assigned the lowest score if it is applicable to only a certain type of geographical location and does not incorporate local details of an aquifer temporal scale reflects the temporal coverage of an index the index is ranked at the topmost position if the groundwater index represents the variation on a monthly basis the lowest score is assigned if the groundwater index does not specify the temporal resolution 2 1 1 3 scientific robustness scientific robustness relates to the reliability of the index within the scientific community castro et al 2018 reliability is assessed based on recognition by the scientific community if the index has been published in peer reviewed journals and further positive discussion has been done by the scientific community review then it is given a high score however the index is given the lowest score if it has been published only in grey literature 2 1 1 4 transparency this criterion is used for the communication of scientific results for upstream midstream and downstream audiences and how a threshold of an index is defined keyantash and dracup 2002 here the upstream midstream and downstream audiences are scientists decision makers and the general public respectively the highest score is assigned to the index if it is easy to understand for both the scientific community decision makers and the general public as well and also has defined threshold values along with levels of severity very low high extreme etc on the other hand the lowest score is designated if an index is difficult to understand overall its threshold value is not properly defined and the levels of level of severity are not given 2 1 1 5 extendibility it is the degree to which the index may be extended across time to predict or forecast future scenarios thus the extendibility of an index is primarily dependent upon the availability of the historical and the generation of future data used for the development of an index the highest score is given to an index if the availability of historical data and the future data projection are easy the lowest score is given if the historical data availability and projection are difficult 3 an overview of groundwater indices this section comprises a review of the existing groundwater indices groundwater indices can be divided into three classes a general groundwater scarcity and stress b groundwater footprint and c groundwater sustainability indices with the help of the review the advantages and disadvantages of each index are discussed 3 1 groundwater scarcity and stress indices in this section general groundwater scarcity and stress indices have been reviewed the reviewed indices were based on different methodologies and can be used for a variety of cases ranging from the initial to the detailed assessment of an aquifer or region 3 1 1 groundwater scarcity index the groundwater scarcity index ig is determined as the ratio of groundwater withdrawal gw to groundwater resources gr as expressed in equation 1 zeng et al 2013 1 i g g w g r 3 1 2 aquifer water scarcity index the aquifer water scarcity index awsi has been defined as the ratio of the actual groundwater abstraction minus the allowable abstraction and the actual abstraction each month sanginabadi et al 2019 the awsi is mathematically expressed in equation 2 2 awsi actual abstraction allowable abstraction actual abstraction the actual groundwater abstraction is the difference between naturalized and observed groundwater levels whereas the allowable groundwater abstraction is the difference between the naturalized groundwater level and the safe yield in fig 1 the observed groundwater level and naturalized groundwater level are represented with a solid line and dashed line respectively the red line is showing the average normal situation or threshold level 3 1 3 aquifer stress index asi six evaluation criteria viz water levels water quality groundwater pumping saltwater intrusion recharge and land use are aggregated to determine the aquifer stress index asia for each criterion a rating score and weight are used to evaluate the stress level somaratne 2019 the asia is mathematically expressed in equation 3 3 a s i a i 1 n w i r i where parameters r and w are the ratings and weights respectively assigned to each criterion i based on asia the aquifer is classified into five levels threshold limits and classifications of asia are given in detail in table 2 3 1 4 groundwater stress index based on withdrawal and recharge pfister et al 2009 developed an index to estimate the freshwater stress based on the annual freshwater withdrawals to hydrological availability ratio later on gomez and pfister 2012 modified it to obtain the groundwater stress index this groundwater stress index wsiwta is based on the annual average of groundwater withdrawal to groundwater recharge and is expressed as shown in equation 4 the plus point of this index is that it covers the temporal variability of the groundwater resources it is assumed that extreme water stress occurs when withdrawal exceeds than recharge 4 w s i w t a 1 1 99 e 3 84 w t a g w v f where wta gw is an average of groundwater withdrawal to groundwater recharge ratio and vf is the variation factor accounting for the temporal variability of water availability vf can be estimated as the aggregated measure of the dispersion of the multiplicative standard deviation of monthly s month and annual precipitation s year assuming a log normal distribution and considering precipitation data as expressed in equation 5 5 vf e ln s month 2 ln s year 2 3 1 5 groundwater stress index based on consumption and recharge the groundwater stress index wsicta can also be calculated based on groundwater consumption and recharge therefore it can be defined as the ratio of the mean annual groundwater consumption to groundwater recharge gomez and pfister 2012 consumption to recharge based water stress index is mathematically expressed in equation 6 groundwater consumption is equal to total groundwater withdrawal minus return flow from agricultural fields 6 w s i c t a 1 1 99 e 19 c t a g w v f where wsicta groundwater stress index based on groundwater consumption to recharge ratio cta gw mean annual groundwater consumption to groundwater recharge ratio vf variation factor accounting for the temporal variability of water availability 3 1 6 aquifer stress index aquifer stress index aqsi is expressed as the fraction of the available groundwater recharge used for human water use wada and heinrich 2013 the aqsi uses a concept similar to the groundwater footprint gf developed by gleeson et al 2012 but it is expressed as a dimensionless unit rather than the area m2 aqsi can be estimated by using equation 7 an aquifer is considered under stress conditions if the aqsi 1 7 aqsi gw a r nat r irri r env where gwa is the groundwater abstraction for human water use rnat is the natural groundwater recharge rirri is the groundwater recharge by the agriculture return flow and renv is the groundwater contribution to the environmental flow 3 1 7 droughtwater scarcity index sanginabadi et al 2019 proposed a new index namely the droughtwater scarcity dws index by combining two existing indices standardized groundwater index and the deficit rate by using the proposed index it is possible to monitor both phenomena drought and water scarcity simultaneously and determine the individual impact of natural and artificial factors on an aquifer s hydrological condition the dws index is mathematically expressed in equation 8 8 dws log n 1 d klog n 2 s where dws is the droughtwater scarcity index and it is unitless d is drought severity indicated by the standardized groundwater index and the value of d can be determined by using equation 9 kubicz 2018 bloomfield et al 2015 saghafian and sanginabadi 2020 s is the severity of water scarcity indicated by the deficit rate and the water deficit rate is mathematically defined below in equation 10 moreover k is a positive number that indicates the importance of water deficit in relation to drought the value of k is assumed to be 2 based on previous studies n1 is the number of drought conditions and n2 is the number of water scarcity conditions threshold limits and classifications of droughtwater scarcity are given in detail in table 2 9 d f d μ δ where d is the standardized groundwater index and it is unitless f d is the normalized value of the measured groundwater level μ is the average value of the normalized groundwater level and δ is the standard deviation of the normalized groundwater level the deficit rate is the ratio of the groundwater shortage and the groundwater demand the deficit rate is a unitless index huang and chou 2005 as expressed below in equation 10 10 deficit rate groundwater shortage groundwater demand 3 2 water stress indices based on groundwater footprint the water footprint network used the concept of water footprint that aims to account for the water productivity of global freshwater as a limited resource marrison and schulte 2010 farooq and gheewala 2019 the water footprint of an individual community or business is defined as the total volume of freshwater that is used to produce the goods and services consumed by the individual or community or produced by the business vanham and bidoglio 2013 groundwater stress can be estimated by using the groundwater footprint concept 3 2 1 groundwater footprint index groundwater footprint gf introduced in 2012 is defined as the area required to sustain groundwater use and groundwater dependent ecosystem services of an aquifer or watershed etc gleeson et al 2012 gleeson and wada 2013 kourgialas et al 2018 the groundwater footprint can be estimated based on equation 11 the ratio of groundwater footprint to aquifer area gf a has been used for the groundwater stress index nayyeri et al 2020 pérez et al 2019 as expressed in equation 12 11 gf a c r e where gf is the groundwater footprint m2 c is the area averaged annual abstraction of groundwater m day r is the recharge rate m day e is the groundwater contribution to environmental streamflow m day and a is the areal extent of any region of interest given in m2 12 gf a c r e gf a 1 indicates unsustainable groundwater consumption that could affect groundwater availability and gf a 1 indicates unsustainable groundwater mining often groundwater recharged under past climatic conditions a ratio of gf a 1 represents sustainable groundwater extraction gleeson et al 2012 3 2 2 integrated groundwater footprint index integrated groundwater footprint igf a was developed by incorporating water quality into the groundwater footprint kourgialas et al 2018 groundwater stress can be estimated through the igf a as expressed in equation 13 it can be summarized that the gleeson et al 2012 methodology underestimates the groundwater stress value in cases where there are also significant water quality issues 13 igf gf 1 n cf 1 a 1 a cf 2 a 2 a cf n a n a where igf is integrated groundwater footprint n is the number of contaminants in the system and cf is 1 n contamination factor for contaminant j with j 1 n if the concentration of a specific contaminant j is above a certain threshold set as the maximum allowable concentration of the contaminant in drinking water as defined by the world health organization who then cfj is considered equal to 1 active otherwise it is considered as zero inactive 3 2 3 groundwater footprint index at sub systems level groundwater footprint assessment has been proposed at the sub system level by chen et al 2020 three parameters of groundwater footprint the average annual abstraction of groundwater c recharge rate r and groundwater contribution to environmental streamflow e are estimated at the sub system level the estimation of recharge r at the sub system level is obtained by adding the groundwater recharge from rainfall recharge rr river leakage recharge rl canal return supply rc lateral inflow rli and leakage yield rly as expressed in equation 14 the unit of these terms is m day 14 r r r r i r c r li r ly the estimation of groundwater consumption c at the sub system level can be obtained by the summation of deep groundwater consumption cd and shallow groundwater consumption cs as expressed in equation 15 shallow groundwater consumption is obtained by adding the shallow groundwater withdrawal csgw diving evaporation cde phreatic labeled evaporation cple lateral outflow clo and leakage yield cly deep groundwater consumption is obtained by adding the exploitation of deep groundwater cdgw lateral outflow clo and leakage yield cly as expressed in equation 16 the unit of groundwater consumption is m day 15 c c d c s 16 c c sgw c de c ple c lo c ly c dgw c lo c ly e is the groundwater s contribution to the environmental streamflow and its unit is m day and it can be obtained at the sub systemic level by using equation 17 17 e 100 μ a δ h n where μ is the degree of water supply of the aquifer to the environment a is the area δh is the duration of groundwater recovery from the current level to the original level and n is the recovery period is assumed thirty years groundwater footprint can be assessed at the sub system level by substituting the values of r c and e from 14 16 and 17 respectively into equation 12 the advantage of this method is to estimate the parameters of groundwater footprint at the sub system level which is not possible through other methods based on gf a groundwater over recovery levels and aquifer health ratings are detailed in table 3 3 3 groundwater sustainability index in this category five groundwater sustainability indices are discussed based on aggregating indicators drivers pressures state impact response dpsir method reliability resilience vulnerability rrv method modified rrv method and blue groundwater sustainability index bgwsi 3 3 1 groundwater sustainability index based on aggregating indicators individual indicators are collected into a single index based on an underlying model of the multidimensional concept being measured to create a composite indicator rovan 2011 guidelines on dealing with technical issues such as data selection imputation normalization and aggregation during the construction of composite indicators have been provided by nardo et al 2008 composite indicators have been used by hydrologists as well to evaluate groundwater sustainability for example singh and bhakar 2020 pandey et al 2011 and bui et al 2019 applied groundwater sustainability index gsia based on aggregating indicators gsia is very flexible it can be applied even in the area facing data scarcity issues the gsia is obtained by aggregating the value of each indicator and its attributed weight pandey et al 2011 to represent the gsia from 0 to 1 scale is used 1 represents the highest degree of sustainability while 0 represents the worst degree of sustainability and 0 5 represents the threshold value 3 3 2 groundwater sustainability index based on the dpsir method the dpsir approach was formally developed by the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd to assess sustainability alexakis 2021 this approach has often been used to assess groundwater sustainability gsid jia et al 2019 li et al 2011 for example borji et al 2018 discussed the different types of indicators related to each category of dpsir different indicators related to each category are shown in fig 2 jia et al 2019 the gsid is calculated by taking the weighted average of indicators values related to each category wang et al 2020 3 3 3 groundwater sustainability index based on rrv method the sustainability of a groundwater system can also be defined as a function of performance indicators reliability resilience and vulnerability loucks 1997 in the case of groundwater resources reliability is defined as how frequently the system would be in the satisfactory domain resilience is defined as the likelihood of groundwater storage recovering to its normal position after an event resiliency indicates how quickly a system returns to a satisfactory condition after an unsatisfactory event vulnerability is defined as a probabilistic measure that accounts for the extent and magnitude of failure thomas 2019 mays 2013 hashimoto et al 1982 the relative sustainability of the system with respect to each of these criteria is higher when the reliability and resilience are greater and the vulnerability is smaller mathematical expressions of reliability resilience and vulnerability are given in equations 18 20 respectively all these three performance indicators are unitless 18 reliability number of satisfactory conditions total number of conditions 19 resilience number of times a satisfactory condition follows an unsatisfactory condition total number of unsatisfactory conditions 20 vulnerability f s j p j where s j refers to the magnitude of the event p j refers to the probability of the severity of the magnitude during the study period and f is the average failure of the groundwater system groundwater sustainability index gsirrv based on reliability resilience and vulnerability can be calculated as given in equation 21 wang et al 2019 thomas et al 2017 thomas 2019 to represent the gsirrv from 0 to 1 scale is used 0 gsirrv 0 2 means extremely unsustainable gsirrv 0 5 is a threshold limit below which gsirrv is unsustainable and 0 75 gsirrv 1 means highly sustainable 21 gsi rrv rel res 1 vul 3 3 4 groundwater sustainability index based on modified rrv method the groundwater sustainability index mgsirrv based rrv method was modified by sandoval et al 2011 in the modified method geometric mean is used as given in equation 22 rather than a simple multiplication of the performance indicators rrv sandoval et al 2011 mays 2013 pedro monzonís et al 2015 ahmed et al 2019 if a certain water user has 50 performance each for reliability resilience and vulnerability then the groundwater sustainability calculated with gsirrv and mgsirrv are 13 and 50 respectively that shows the mgsirrv yields a more reasonable estimate of groundwater sustainability as compared to the gsirrv the remaining pros and cons are the same as the previously discussed index 22 mgsi rrv rel res 1 vul 1 3 3 3 5 blue groundwater sustainability index the bgwsi is the ratio of the nonrenewable groundwater abstraction nrgwa and consumptive blue groundwater use cbgwu wada and bierkens 2014 blue groundwater sustainability index can be determined by using cbgwu and nrgwa as expressed in equation 23 the cbgwu is the sum of groundwater consumption used by livestock irrigation domestic and industrial sectors the term nrgwa is used when the abstraction of groundwater is more than the recharge 23 bgwsi nrgw a cbgwu a summary of the characteristics pros and cons and applicability of groundwater indices are given in table 4 after the review it was found that most of the indices do not define the role of modernization climate change impacts groundwater contribution to environmental flow 1 1 environmental flows are defined as the quantity timing and quality of freshwater flows and levels necessary to sustain aquatic ecosystems that in turn support human cultures economies sustainable livelihoods and well being arthington et al 2018 groundwater recharge from the river canal open channels and other irrigation structures a few indices incorporated groundwater quality as an indicator these above mentioned drawbacks can limit the applicability of these methodologies worldwide and the advantages of the indices can make them favorable for some particular areas therefore the applicability of each index under review is mentioned in the next section each groundwater index has its own characteristics range of applications pros and cons however some characteristics range of applications pros and cons are the same among groundwater indices which can confuse policymakers to choose the most suitable index based on the available resources characteristics range of applications pros and cons therefore this issue was addressed by ranking the groundwater indices based on five different criteria the qualitative assessment of each index was done by passing through each criterion using a scale of one to five for lowest and highest scores respectively the groundwater footprint index defined by gleeson et al 2012 secured the highest score based on the five criteria under consideration the groundwater stress index based on consumption to recharge defined by gomez and pfister 2012 and the groundwater stress index based on withdrawal to recharge defined by gomez and pfister 2012 shared the second rank on the other hand the aquifer water scarcity index defined by sanginabadi et al 2019 based on criteria for the groundwater scarcity assessment was the least prioritized index because of lower tractability sophistication and transparency as compared to the other groundwater indices under consideration the score of each groundwater index against each criterion sub criterion is given in table 5 4 conclusion groundwater is a crucial resource for the socio economic development of our societies thus this study evaluated different index based methodologies to examine the issues related to groundwater scarcity stress and sustainability in any area region the selection of a suitable groundwater index is vital for accurate assessment followed by the development of effective strategies for the mitigation of groundwater related issues scarcity stress etc to get realistic outcomes and better planning indices based on drivers pressures state impact response dpsir and aggregation methods for groundwater sustainability can be recommended to get more realistic outcomes and better plaining groundwater related issues across the globe considering the five criteria of tractability sophistication scientific robustness extendibility and transparency the groundwater footprint index gf had the highest rank it is the best in tractability scientific robustness and extendibility and is second best in transparency as compared to the other exiting groundwater indices however the policymakers can also choose the most suitable index for their specific needs ease of use comprehensive etc based on the results of this study as provided in table 5 a new index was proposed by combining the two existing indices to minimize the uncertainty in the groundwater stress assessment this study proposed a modified groundwater footprint mgf index for assessing groundwater stress by coupling the methodologies of integrated groundwater footprint index igf a and groundwater footprint index at subsystem level gfs the igf a covers quality aspects along with quantity but accuracy lacks the accuracy can be obtained by using gfs but it does not cover the quality aspect of groundwater the mgf provides the advantages of both indices gfs and igf a in one and overcomes the shortcomings of both existing indices therefore the results of mgf can be more comprehensive and accurate than the existing ones moreover the igf used who standards for water quality in the groundwater stress estimation applying the who drinking water standards for water quality especially in the aquifer where the main user is agriculture is not appropriate using the who standards for the agricultural dominant aquifer can cause an overestimation of groundwater stress to avoid this problem it is recommended that fao standards should be used in the agrarian dominant aquifer the threshold values of different contamination of drinking water can be accessed through the who platform and irrigation water quality standards based on fao can be accessed from the fao platform however the drawbacks of the proposed index are the large data requirement and expertise required for the computation which may be a concern for developing countries this drawback can be overcome by generating the data with the help of numerical modeling a good water scarcity index should deal with water quantity quality and environmental flow the mgf index can also be a meaningful addition to the list of lca based water stress indices because it carries all the qualities of a good water stress index the proposed mgf index can also be very helpful for policymakers to assess groundwater stress with more accuracy and inclusiveness policymakers of water management agriculture and water conservation departments can use the mgf index to cope with water stress issues the proposed index can be more useful where the river density is high rich in flora and fauna and dependence on groundwater is high as well however in future work it is recommended to incorporate the physical and economic accessibility indicators in the future development of the groundwater stress index because lack of accessibility to water can create difficulty in water use and thus influence water stress here the indicator accessibility refers to the level of ease to access the groundwater declaration of

11791,groundwater is the largest store of available freshwater in the world with the increasing impact of climate change and human activities assessment of variations in groundwater levels is essential this study presents the trend of groundwater levels in three districts purbi singhbhum ranchi and saraikela of jharkhand state india the depth to groundwater level dgwl data from 24 wells over the three districts for 1996 2018 is collected for both pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons the conventional non parametric trend analysis techniques e g mann kendall sen s slope spearman s rho tests have several restrictive assumptions such as gaussian distributed time series and absence of serial correlation innovative trend analysis ita technique does not have these restrictive assumptions and therefore can be effectively used to detect trends in a time series of shorter length moreover ita is a slope based technique that provides visual interpretations as well as the statistical significance of trends in a time series thereby comprehensively acquiring the benefits of multiple conventional methods therefore ita is employed in this study to investigate the trends in groundwater levels the results reveal a significantly increasing trend of dgwl for 17 sites in pre monsoon and 14 sites in post monsoon seasons on the other hand only four and six stations showed negative trends during pre and post monsoon seasons respectively the increasing dgwl trends at a majority of the sites imply a serious decline in the groundwater levels over the years this study will be helpful to water resources managers to identify the causes of the declining groundwater levels take necessary actions to control them and efficiently manage groundwater at local levels graphical abstract image 1 keywords trend analysis ita groundwater level changes 1 introduction groundwater is the largest source of freshwater available on earth groundwater is used for industrial agricultural and domestic purposes and it fulfills more than one third of global drinking water demands katsanou and karapanagioti 2017 carrard et al 2019 moreover it provides resilience to drought at the initial phase and is an alternative source of water for drought mitigation al adaileh et al 2019 langridge and van schmidt 2020 however in recent years the adverse impacts of global climate change and anthropogenic activities on hydrogeological systems have become a serious threat to sustainability of water resources bhattacharya et al 2008 ali et al 2019 kimambo et al 2019 duttagupta et al 2020 ijumulana et al 2020 yadav et al 2020 maity et al 2021 mukherjee et al 2021 guptha et al 2021 2022 swain et al 2017 2018 2022a bhanja et al 2019 2020 amiri et al 2021 bahita et al 2021a 2021b dhal and swain 2021 malakar et al 2021a sahoo et al 2021 frequent droughts may influence groundwater pumping as well as recharge conditions numerous researchers have studied the impacts of climate change on groundwater systems eckhardt and ulbrich 2003 dragoni and sukhija 2008 shah 2009 earman and dettinger 2011 green et al 2011 holman et al 2012 akbari et al 2020 hamidov et al 2020 along with climate change human activities such as industrialization rapid urbanization and intensified agriculture have caused depletion of groundwater resources further population explosion has resulted in a steep rise in global water demands and has put an additional anthropogenic stress on water supplies consequently in many regions the withdrawal of groundwater has been much higher than the natural replenishments al ibrahim 1991 rodell et al 2009 schwartz and ibaraki 2011 taylor et al 2013 famiglietti 2014 bhanja et al 2017 dey et al 2017 mukherjee et al 2018 2020 swain et al 2022b 2022c 2022d therefore it has become necessary to monitor the groundwater dynamics at regular intervals to address the ever increasing concerns of water availability the trend analyses through statistical methods have become popular in recent years especially to evaluate the temporal variations in groundwater levels studying the groundwater level trends helps in understanding the behavior of aquifers in response to climatic and anthropogenic factors which contributes to better management of groundwater resources hoque et al 2007 shamsudduha et al 2009 tabari et al 2012 chaudhuri and ale 2014 hodgkins et al 2017 le brocque et al 2018 numerous similar studies exist in the literature however they are mostly limited to application of the conventional trend tests i e linear regression mann kendall mk sen slope ss and modified mann kendall mmk an improved version of mk tests it is well documented that non parametric tests are advantageous over parametric tests for trend analysis swain et al 2019 2021 2022a in the ss test the nature of the trend i e increasing decreasing is determined from the sign of the slope whereas the mmk test has the advantage of providing the statistical significance of the trend along with its nature however these tests also have several restrictive assumptions e g gaussian distribution serial correlation etc they assume the data to be normally distributed which needs a continuous length of 30 observations or above the long term continuous groundwater data availability has always been a challenge particularly for developing countries the interpretations of mmk or ss test results with shorter data length may be misleading the innovative trend analysis ita technique developed by sen 2012 evades this problem apart from having no restrictive assumptions the ita technique provides a visual interpretation of the trends in a time series another advantage of this technique is that it is not significantly affected by a few missing data points in the time series and thus can be applied to time series with shorter data length furthermore it possesses the benefits of both mmk and ss tests i e it determines the nature of the trend from the sign of the slope and also appraises the significance of the detected trend ita methodology has been employed in several recent research works şen 2014 dabanlı et al 2016 elouissi et al 2016 mohorji et al 2017

groundwater levels moreover it is evident from most of the previous studies over the indian region that the groundwater level changes are highly influenced by the monsoon season as it contributes the majority of annual rainfall therefore it is advisable to analyze groundwater level trends during the pre and post monsoon seasons separately the focus of the present study is on three districts of jharkhand purbi singhbhum ranchi and saraikela jharkhand is one of the least developed states of india although it is rich in coal and mineral resources prathap and chakraborty 2019 groundwater in these three districts mostly occurs within shallow fractured or weathered horizons in hard rock aquifers sapari et al 2012 singh and singh 2012 das 2017 nayak et al 2020 giri et al 2021 the unawareness of the populace regarding sustainable use of natural resources and environment rapidly increasing population unplanned farming practices discharge of untreated effluents and increasing mining activities may adversely affect the groundwater quantity and quality therefore it becomes essential to understand dynamics of the groundwater levels for sustainable water resources management although there have been several recent large scale studies asoka et al 2017 bhanja et al 2017 malakar et al 2021b on trend analysis of groundwater levels over the indian region no study has explicitly focused on jharkhand state in general or these three districts in particular moreover most of the previous studies on trend analysis of groundwater levels employ the conventional parametric non parametric methods irrespective of their shorter data length therefore the use of ita for detecting and visualizing the trend of groundwater level along with its significance is promising even with limited data however the application of ita in groundwater investigations has not been well explored with the exception of the research by minea et al 2020 in northeastern romania the authors are not aware of any study that has employed ita in india to assess the trends in groundwater levels the specific objectives of this study are to 1 apply ita for assessing the recent trends in groundwater levels in the three districts 2 analyze the trends in pre and post monsoon seasons to understand the seasonal variations and 3 investigate the relationship of rainfall and temperature trends to groundwater level changes 2 study area and data used the location of the study area is presented in fig 1 purbi singhbhum is bordered by both odisha and west bengal states whereas ranchi and saraikela are bordered by west bengal the study area covers a total area of 11 300 km2 with a population around 6 3 million census 2011 and falls in the humid sub tropical climatic region shree and kumar 2018 the region is marked by various mining and industrial activities harshwardhan and tripathy 2015 the increasing population and the anthropogenic activities in the region pose a threat to natural resources in general and groundwater resources in particular the elevation in the study area ranges from 42 m to 1043 m fig 1 the prevailing morphology and intensity of structural discontinuities mainly control the occurrence and movement of groundwater toppo 2013 as shown in fig 2 the region possesses remarkable diversity in geological units chotanagpur gneiss and metasedimentary rocks are the major geological units covering over 60 of the study area followed by dhanjori lava basic rocks singhbhum granite older alluvium and laterite tertiary gravels granite dhanjori quartzite and conglomerate and basic ultrabasic rocks the remaining geological units lower vindhyan system gabbro anorthosite and laterites constitute less than 1 of the region the details of the geomorphology

ministry of water resources government of india the annual rainfall and the average maximum daily temperature data over the study area were collected from the india meteorological department imd average annual rainfall varies from less than 1100 mm to above 1500 mm as shown in fig 3 the rainfall is lower in the higher elevation zones of ranchi district and is maximum in the low elevation zones of purbi singhbhum district figs 1 and 3 average daily maximum temperature increases slightly but systematically with decreasing elevation fig 4 the depth to groundwater level dgwl data for different sites over the three districts for pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons were collected from water resources information system www india wris nrsc gov in central water commission india there were 154 wells in total in the study area however after inspecting the length and quality criteria of the available data only 24 sites were selected for trend analysis fig 1 wells with less than 16 years of observations or discontinuous information were excluded eleven of the 24 selected wells are located in ranchi while purbi singhbhum and saraikela have eight and five respectively the details of these sites their location and duration of data availability are presented in table 1 3 methodology sen 2012 proposed the ita technique with an objective of recognizing the differences between the first and second half of a time series each half must contain an equal number of data points and is arranged in an order either increasing or decreasing the data points from both the halves form pairs that are plotted on the cartesian coordinate system with a diagonal 1 1 line drawn at 45 angle as shown in fig 5 the x axis and y axis of the plot represent the data values of the first and second half respectively the underlying concept of the method is that the ranked pairs from the first and second halves should lie along a 1 1 line if they are identical if most of the points lie to the left of the 1 1 line the centroid and the trend line would also lie to the left of the 1 1 line as in case of fig 5 this represents the presence of an increasing trend in the overall time series on the contrary for a decreasing trend the centroid and the trend line lie to the right of the 1 1 line the closer the trend line to the 1 1 line the weaker is the magnitude of the trend in the absence of a monotonic trend i e existence of multiple trends the points are located on a curve the primary advantage of the ita technique is that it provides a visual interpretation of the trends in a time series furthermore unlike other parametric and non parametric trend tests this method has no restrictive assumptions sen et al 2019 another advantage of the ita technique is that it is not significantly affected by a few missing data points in the time series however an even number of data points must be selected as the data points are plotted in pairs from the first and second halves of the time series several recent papers kisi 2015 öztopal and şen 2017 caloiero et al 2018 serencam 2019 alifujiang et al 2020 joshi and makhasana 2020 marak et al 2020 wang et al 2020 provide a detailed exploration of the ita technique the slope s is computed as 1 s 2 y 2 y 1 n 2 y 2 x 2 n 2 y 2 y 1 n where y 1 and y 2 are the mean values of the first half and second half sub series respectively n is the total number of data points in the entire time series x2 y2 are the coordinates of the centroid and y1 is the ordinate of the projection of the centroid on the 1 1 line fig 5 positive and negative signs of s indicate the trend is increasing and decreasing respectively since the trend line is drawn parallel to the 1 1 line the value y2 y1 is the intercept of the trend line the slope standard deviation σs is given by 2 σ s 2 2 n n σ 1 ρ y 1 y 2 where σ is the standard deviation of the entire time series and ρ y 1 y 2 is the correlation between the sub series computed as 3 ρ y 1 y 2 n 2 y 1 y 2 y 1 y 2 n 2 y 1 2 y 1 2 n 2 y 2 2 y 2 2 the significance of the trend is also assessed by the ita technique for a particular significance level the critical slope scrit is determined if s s c r i t i e the magnitude of the slope is greater than the magnitude of scrit then the trend is regarded as significant sen 2017 for a significance level of 5 the critical slope is given by 4 s c r i t 1 96 σ s 4 results the ita plots for the stations of purbi singhbhum district are depicted in this section and those of the other districts are presented in the supplementary information to understand the possibility of climatic causalities the long term trends in rainfall and temperature over the study area are also investigated 4 1 trend of dgwl for purbi singhbhum district the results of ita for dgwl at different sites in purbi singhbhum district for pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons are presented in fig 6 and fig 7 respectively the trend line clearly lies to the left of the 1 1 line for baharagora chakulia dhalbhumgarh and ghatsila sites during both pre and post monsoon periods indicating an increasing trend of dgwl for hara tirin the trend is also clearly increasing in pre monsoon season but in post monsoon season the data points lie either on the diagonal line or slightly to the left consequently the trend line is very close to the 1 1 line implying a weak increasing trend on the other hand jamsola 2 and potka exhibit decreasing trends of dgwl during post monsoon season the data points of jamsola 2 fall on a curve in pre monsoon season thus indicating the absence of a monotonic trend for potka the pre monsoon trend is increasing although the points lie close to the trend line the dgwl trend of sundarnagar is significantly increasing and non monotonic for pre and post monsoon periods respectively overall none of the sites in the pre monsoon season and only two sites in the post monsoon season show decreasing trends in purbi singhbhum district the dgwl is significantly higher for all the sites in pre monsoon as compared to post monsoon period as evident from the centroid points of ita plots of all the sites of the district figs 6 and 7 4 2 trend of dgwl for ranchi district the ita plots of dgwl in ranchi district figs s1 and s2 in supplementary information show a clearly negative trend for both pre and post monsoon seasons at barwadag and silli as almost all the points lie in the lower triangular portion i e right side of 1 1 line in contrast the trend is positive in both seasons at burmoo chutupalu and tamar the trend line lies to the left of the 1 1 line for angara in both seasons however for the pre monsoon season the data points are distributed on both sides of the diagonal line and the trend detected may be spurious on the other hand for post monsoon season all the points lie on the upper triangular portion implying an increasing trend even though the trend line lies close to the diagonal line for berro the trend of dgwl is clearly increasing in pre monsoon season however there is no monotonic trend in post monsoon season as the points are uniformly distributed on both upper and lower triangular portions consequently the trend line almost coincides with the 1 1 line in pre monsoon season there is no trend for bundu as the trend line lies very close to the diagonal whereas for the post monsoon season the trend is negative the data points for kalimati take the shape of a curve for pre monsoon season inferring the absence of a monotonic trend however the trend is remarkably increasing in post monsoon season for mandar a weak increasing trend of dgwl is witnessed in pre monsoon season as all the points lie either on the diagonal or just to the left of it similarly in post monsoon season the points are scattered in both sides of the diagonal and no definite pattern is observed thus even though the trend line lies to the left of the 1 1 line the trend detected may be spurious the trends in both the seasons at ormanji are contrasting with notably decreasing and increasing trends in pre and post monsoon seasons respectively overall trends of dgwl at different sites in ranchi district vary but most of them are increasing 4 3 trend of dgwl for saraikela district the ita plots for dgwl at five sites in saraikela district for pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons are presented in fig s3 and fig s4 respectively an increasing trend can be noticed for chandil and kandra during both pre and post monsoon seasons as almost all the points lie in the upper triangular portion the results are also similar for the rajnagar site however there is a significant seasonal difference in groundwater levels as evident from the position of the centroid the mean dgwl is almost double in pre monsoon season as compared to the post monsoon season therefore the groundwater level over rajnagar declines in pre monsoon season but gets sufficient recharge during monsoon leading to the rise in water levels the trend of dgwl at kharsawan is clearly decreasing in pre monsoon season however in post monsoon season the data points take the shape of a curve and thus there is no monotonic trend moreover hardly any difference between the trend line and the 1 1 line is noticeable at saraikela site the trend is clearly increasing in pre monsoon and decreasing in post monsoon season overall the sites in saraikela district possessed mostly an increasing trend of dgwl in both seasons 4 4 statistical significance of ita based trends over the study area a comparison between slope s and critical slope scrit determines whether the detected trend is significant the key statistical figures obtained from ita application i e s scrit centroid point and intercept of trend line y2 y1 for all 24 sites for both pre and post monsoon seasons are presented in table 2 it can be observed that the trend of dgwl is decreasing for only four of these sites in pre monsoon season the trend is increasing for the remaining 20 sites and is significant at 17 of these sites similarly in post monsoon season an increasing dgwl trend is observed at 17 sites 14 significant whereas a decreasing trend is observed at only seven sites six significant hence it is apparent that most of the sites exhibit an increasing trend of dgwl in both the seasons also the coordinates of the centroid for pre monsoon season are much higher compared to those of the post monsoon season for most of the sites this indicates that the dgwl is lower in post monsoon season because of the rise in water level likely contributed by rainfall in monsoon season regarding the intercepts computed as the vertical distance of centroid from the diagonal line i e y2 y1 the sign which is the same as the sign of s indicates the nature of the trend i e increasing or decreasing the magnitude of y2 y1 indicates the closeness of the trend line and the 1 1 line the lesser the magnitude the closer are the lines and thus the weaker the trend the results of this study indicate a significant temporal decline in the groundwater levels for both pre and post monsoon at nearly half of the sites 11 of 24 as summarized in fig 8 two sites have significant negative trends for both pre and post monsoon three sites have a significant positive pre monsoon and negative post monsoon trend and one site has a significant negative pre monsoon and positive post monsoon trend the seasonal contrasts in trends can be attributed to influence of anthropogenic activities as well as the climatic characteristics the anthropogenic factors include population growth expansion of agricultural fields and urban areas and increased industrialization these activities also lead to a surge in water demand resulting in depletion of groundwater levels climatic factors primarily rainfall and temperature may also affect the dynamics of groundwater level the changes in intensity duration and frequency of precipitation are responsible for the occurrence of droughts or floods which directly affect groundwater recharge temperature is a major control on evapotranspiration which may also affect groundwater recharge the groundwater levels also vary in magnitude and timing under the influence of climate change in addition changing climatic characteristics govern the groundwater uses particularly for agricultural purposes and thus affect the groundwater system 4 5 trends of rainfall and temperature over the study area long term 1980 2018 data for annual rainfall and daily averaged maximum temperature have been procured from imd considering the sufficient length of the time series the non parametric modified mann kendall mmk test was applied where the sign positive negative of zmmk the mmk test statistic determines the nature of trend increasing decreasing and its magnitude determines the significance the results of mmk test are presented in fig 9 it can be observed from fig 9 that a major portion of the study area has experienced an increasing but insignificant trend of rainfall whereas the northernmost portion high elevation zones of ranchi district has experienced a remarkably decreasing trend with high statistical significance temperature showed a significantly increasing trend over the entire region as evident from the zmmk possessing a lowest value of 2 75 fig 9b overall it can be inferred that the climatic factors have contributed to the declining groundwater levels over most of the study area 5 discussion the united nations un formulated 17 sustainable development goals sdgs in 2015 as a universal call to act collectively towards ending poverty and promoting peace and prosperity while protecting the planet for future generations sdg 6 clean water and sanitation which aims to ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all is relevant to the water resources sector bhattacharya and bundschuh 2015 saha et al 2018 various specific targets set by the un that come under sdg 6 include integrating water resources management increasing water use efficiency prioritizing sustainable development of groundwater reducing pollution to improve water quality ensuring accessibility to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene restoring water related ecosystems and strengthening the involvement of local people water is also core to sdg 2 which aims to attain food security and end hunger as india is a country with a very large and rapidly growing population achieving food security is associated with agricultural intensification leading to increased use of groundwater for irrigation bhanja and mukherjee 2019 overall there is a notable decrease in groundwater level over the study area which is likely to aggravate the problems of water scarcity in future and pose serious challenges to achieve the sdgs the dgwl is significantly higher in pre monsoon season than post monsoon season over most of the sites as evident from the centroid points this indicates that monsoon rainfall replenishes groundwater storage over the study area the significantly decreasing trends of rainfall over some parts of the study area along with significantly increasing trends of temperature may act as a further threat to the declining groundwater levels further research needs to be carried out to determine the exact causes of such decline and accordingly collective and site specific strategies to increase groundwater recharge should be developed this study recommends adopting mitigation measures to curb groundwater depletion construction of check dams to enhance infiltration minimizing cultivation of water intensive crops construction of artificial recharge structures and conjunctive use of groundwater and surface water are some of the measures that must be considered seriously for improving the groundwater levels the outcomes of this study will help in developing regional groundwater policies for sustainable water management 6 conclusions the changes in groundwater levels in three districts of jharkhand india are explored through ita technique the dgwl data from 24 stations during pre and post monsoon seasons during the period 1996 2018 are considered for the trend analysis the results reveal a significantly increasing trend of dgwl over nearly half the sites during both seasons this implies a chronic decline of groundwater levels over the study area ita technique is found to be a robust method as it provides visual interpretations as well as the statistical significance of the trends in a time series and has no restrictive assumptions the decline in groundwater levels may be due to climate change and or anthropogenic activities this study will be helpful to water resources managers in taking necessary actions to control the groundwater depletion and efficiently managing groundwater at local levels declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

11791,groundwater is the largest store of available freshwater in the world with the increasing impact of climate change and human activities assessment of variations in groundwater levels is essential this study presents the trend of groundwater levels in three districts purbi singhbhum ranchi and saraikela of jharkhand state india the depth to groundwater level dgwl data from 24 wells over the three districts for 1996 2018 is collected for both pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons the conventional non parametric trend analysis techniques e g mann kendall sen s slope spearman s rho tests have several restrictive assumptions such as gaussian distributed time series and absence of serial correlation innovative trend analysis ita technique does not have these restrictive assumptions and therefore can be effectively used to detect trends in a time series of shorter length moreover ita is a slope based technique that provides visual interpretations as well as the statistical significance of trends in a time series thereby comprehensively acquiring the benefits of multiple conventional methods therefore ita is employed in this study to investigate the trends in groundwater levels the results reveal a significantly increasing trend of dgwl for 17 sites in pre monsoon and 14 sites in post monsoon seasons on the other hand only four and six stations showed negative trends during pre and post monsoon seasons respectively the increasing dgwl trends at a majority of the sites imply a serious decline in the groundwater levels over the years this study will be helpful to water resources managers to identify the causes of the declining groundwater levels take necessary actions to control them and efficiently manage groundwater at local levels graphical abstract image 1 keywords trend analysis ita groundwater level changes 1 introduction groundwater is the largest source of freshwater available on earth groundwater is used for industrial agricultural and domestic purposes and it fulfills more than one third of global drinking water demands katsanou and karapanagioti 2017 carrard et al 2019 moreover it provides resilience to drought at the initial phase and is an alternative source of water for drought mitigation al adaileh et al 2019 langridge and van schmidt 2020 however in recent years the adverse impacts of global climate change and anthropogenic activities on hydrogeological systems have become a serious threat to sustainability of water resources bhattacharya et al 2008 ali et al 2019 kimambo et al 2019 duttagupta et al 2020 ijumulana et al 2020 yadav et al 2020 maity et al 2021 mukherjee et al 2021 guptha et al 2021 2022 swain et al 2017 2018 2022a bhanja et al 2019 2020 amiri et al 2021 bahita et al 2021a 2021b dhal and swain 2021 malakar et al 2021a sahoo et al 2021 frequent droughts may influence groundwater pumping as well as recharge conditions numerous researchers have studied the impacts of climate change on groundwater systems eckhardt and ulbrich 2003 dragoni and sukhija 2008 shah 2009 earman and dettinger 2011 green et al 2011 holman et al 2012 akbari et al 2020 hamidov et al 2020 along with climate change human activities such as industrialization rapid urbanization and intensified agriculture have caused depletion of groundwater resources further population explosion has resulted in a steep rise in global water demands and has put an additional anthropogenic stress on water supplies consequently in many regions the withdrawal of groundwater has been much higher than the natural replenishments al ibrahim 1991 rodell et al 2009 schwartz and ibaraki 2011 taylor et al 2013 famiglietti 2014 bhanja et al 2017 dey et al 2017 mukherjee et al 2018 2020 swain et al 2022b 2022c 2022d therefore it has become necessary to monitor the groundwater dynamics at regular intervals to address the ever increasing concerns of water availability the trend analyses through statistical methods have become popular in recent years especially to evaluate the temporal variations in groundwater levels studying the groundwater level trends helps in understanding the behavior of aquifers in response to climatic and anthropogenic factors which contributes to better management of groundwater resources hoque et al 2007 shamsudduha et al 2009 tabari et al 2012 chaudhuri and ale 2014 hodgkins et al 2017 le brocque et al 2018 numerous similar studies exist in the literature however they are mostly limited to application of the conventional trend tests i e linear regression mann kendall mk sen slope ss and modified mann kendall mmk an improved version of mk tests it is well documented that non parametric tests are advantageous over parametric tests for trend analysis swain et al 2019 2021 2022a in the ss test the nature of the trend i e increasing decreasing is determined from the sign of the slope whereas the mmk test has the advantage of providing the statistical significance of the trend along with its nature however these tests also have several restrictive assumptions e g gaussian distribution serial correlation etc they assume the data to be normally distributed which needs a continuous length of 30 observations or above the long term continuous groundwater data availability has always been a challenge particularly for developing countries the interpretations of mmk or ss test results with shorter data length may be misleading the innovative trend analysis ita technique developed by sen 2012 evades this problem apart from having no restrictive assumptions the ita technique provides a visual interpretation of the trends in a time series another advantage of this technique is that it is not significantly affected by a few missing data points in the time series and thus can be applied to time series with shorter data length furthermore it possesses the benefits of both mmk and ss tests i e it determines the nature of the trend from the sign of the slope and also appraises the significance of the detected trend ita methodology has been employed in several recent research works şen 2014 dabanlı et al 2016 elouissi et al 2016 mohorji et al 2017

t i e the magnitude of the slope is greater than the magnitude of scrit then the trend is regarded as significant sen 2017 for a significance level of 5 the critical slope is given by 4 s c r i t 1 96 σ s 4 results the ita plots for the stations of purbi singhbhum district are depicted in this section and those of the other districts are presented in the supplementary information to understand the possibility of climatic causalities the long term trends in rainfall and temperature over the study area are also investigated 4 1 trend of dgwl for purbi singhbhum district the results of ita for dgwl at different sites in purbi singhbhum district for pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons are presented in fig 6 and fig 7 respectively the trend line clearly lies to the left of the 1 1 line for baharagora chakulia dhalbhumgarh and ghatsila sites during both pre and post monsoon periods indicating an increasing trend of dgwl for hara tirin the trend is also clearly increasing in pre monsoon season but in post monsoon season the data points lie either on the diagonal line or slightly to the left consequently the trend line is very close to the 1 1 line implying a weak increasing trend on the other hand jamsola 2 and potka exhibit decreasing trends of dgwl during post monsoon season the data points of jamsola 2 fall on a curve in pre monsoon season thus indicating the absence of a monotonic trend for potka the pre monsoon trend is increasing although the points lie close to the trend line the dgwl trend of sundarnagar is significantly increasing and non monotonic for pre and post monsoon periods respectively overall none of the sites in the pre monsoon season and only two sites in the post monsoon season show decreasing trends in purbi singhbhum district the dgwl is significantly higher for all the sites in pre monsoon as compared to post monsoon period as evident from the centroid points of ita plots of all the sites of the district figs 6 and 7 4 2 trend of dgwl for ranchi district the ita plots of dgwl in ranchi district figs s1 and s2 in supplementary information show a clearly negative trend for both pre and post monsoon seasons at barwadag and silli as almost all the points lie in the lower triangular portion i e right side of 1 1 line in contrast the trend is positive in both seasons at burmoo chutupalu and tamar the trend line lies to the left of the 1 1 line for angara in both seasons however for the pre monsoon season the data points are distributed on both sides of the diagonal line and the trend detected may be spurious on the other hand for post monsoon season all the points lie on the upper triangular portion implying an increasing trend even though the trend line lies close to the diagonal line for berro the trend of dgwl is clearly increasing in pre monsoon season however there is no monotonic trend in post monsoon season as the points are uniformly distributed on both upper and lower triangular portions consequently the trend line almost coincides with the 1 1 line in pre monsoon season there is no trend for bundu as the trend line lies very close to the diagonal whereas for the post monsoon season the trend is negative the data points for kalimati take the shape of a curve for pre monsoon season inferring the absence of a monotonic trend however the trend is remarkably increasing in post monsoon season for mandar a weak increasing trend of dgwl is witnessed in pre monsoon season as all the points lie either on the diagonal or just to the left of it similarly in post monsoon season the points are scattered in both sides of the diagonal and no definite pattern is observed thus even though the trend line lies to the left of the 1 1 line the trend detected may be spurious the trends in both the seasons at ormanji are contrasting with notably decreasing and increasing trends in pre and post monsoon seasons respectively overall trends of dgwl at different sites in ranchi district vary but most of them are increasing 4 3 trend of dgwl for saraikela district the ita plots for dgwl at five sites in saraikela district for pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons are presented in fig s3 and fig s4 respectively an increasing trend can be noticed for chandil and kandra during both pre and post monsoon seasons as almost all the points lie in the upper triangular portion the results are also similar for the rajnagar site however there is a significant seasonal difference in groundwater levels as evident from the position of the centroid the mean dgwl is almost double in pre monsoon season as compared to the post monsoon season therefore the groundwater level over rajnagar declines in pre monsoon season but gets sufficient recharge during monsoon leading to the rise in water levels the trend of dgwl at kharsawan is clearly decreasing in pre monsoon season however in post monsoon season the data points take the shape of a curve and thus there is no monotonic trend moreover hardly any difference between the trend line and the 1 1 line is noticeable at saraikela site the trend is clearly increasing in pre monsoon and decreasing in post monsoon season overall the sites in saraikela district possessed mostly an increasing trend of dgwl in both seasons 4 4 statistical significance of ita based trends over the study area a comparison between slope s and critical slope scrit determines whether the detected trend is significant the key statistical figures obtained from ita application i e s scrit centroid point and intercept of trend line y2 y1 for all 24 sites for both pre and post monsoon seasons are presented in table 2 it can be observed that the trend of dgwl is decreasing for only four of these sites in pre monsoon season the trend is increasing for the remaining 20 sites and is significant at 17 of these sites similarly in post monsoon season an increasing dgwl trend is observed at 17 sites 14 significant whereas a decreasing trend is observed at only seven sites six significant hence it is apparent that most of the sites exhibit an increasing trend of dgwl in both the seasons also the coordinates of the centroid for pre monsoon season are much higher compared to those of the post monsoon season for most of the sites this indicates that the dgwl is lower in post monsoon season because of the rise in water level likely contributed by rainfall in monsoon season regarding the intercepts computed as the vertical distance of centroid from the diagonal line i e y2 y1 the sign which is the same as the sign of s indicates the nature of the trend i e increasing or decreasing the magnitude of y2 y1 indicates the closeness of the trend line and the 1 1 line the lesser the magnitude the closer are the lines and thus the weaker the trend the results of this study indicate a significant temporal decline in the groundwater levels for both pre and post monsoon at nearly half of the sites 11 of 24 as summarized in fig 8 two sites have significant negative trends for both pre and post monsoon three sites have a significant positive pre monsoon and negative post monsoon trend and one site has a significant negative pre monsoon and positive post monsoon trend the seasonal contrasts in trends can be attributed to influence of anthropogenic activities as well as the climatic characteristics the anthropogenic factors include population growth expansion of agricultural fields and urban areas and increased industrialization these activities also lead to a surge in water demand resulting in depletion of groundwater levels climatic factors primarily rainfall and temperature may also affect the dynamics of groundwater level the changes in intensity duration and frequency of precipitation are responsible for the occurrence of droughts or floods which directly affect groundwater recharge temperature is a major control on evapotranspiration which may also affect groundwater recharge the groundwater levels also vary in magnitude and timing under the influence of climate change in addition changing climatic characteristics govern the groundwater uses particularly for agricultural purposes and thus affect the groundwater system 4 5 trends of rainfall and temperature over the study area long term 1980 2018 data for annual rainfall and daily averaged maximum temperature have been procured from imd considering the sufficient length of the time series the non parametric modified mann kendall mmk test was applied where the sign positive negative of zmmk the mmk test statistic determines the nature of trend increasing decreasing and its magnitude determines the significance the results of mmk test are presented in fig 9 it can be observed from fig 9 that a major portion of the study area has experienced an increasing but insignificant trend of rainfall whereas the northernmost portion high elevation zones of ranchi district has experienced a remarkably decreasing trend with high statistical significance temperature showed a significantly increasing trend over the entire region as evident from the zmmk possessing a lowest value of 2 75 fig 9b overall it can be inferred that the climatic factors have contributed to the declining groundwater levels over most of the study area 5 discussion the united nations un formulated 17 sustainable development goals sdgs in 2015 as a universal call to act collectively towards ending poverty and promoting peace and prosperity while protecting the planet for future generations sdg 6 clean water and sanitation which aims to ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all is relevant to the water resources sector bhattacharya and bundschuh 2015 saha et al 2018 various specific targets set by the un that come under sdg 6 include integrating water resources management increasing water use efficiency prioritizing sustainable development of groundwater reducing pollution to improve water quality ensuring accessibility to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene restoring water related ecosystems and strengthening the involvement of local people water is also core to sdg 2 which aims to attain food security and end hunger as india is a country with a very large and rapidly growing population achieving food security is associated with agricultural intensification leading to increased use of groundwater for irrigation bhanja and mukherjee 2019 overall there is a notable decrease in groundwater level over the study area which is likely to aggravate the problems of water scarcity in future and pose serious challenges to achieve the sdgs the dgwl is significantly higher in pre monsoon season than post monsoon season over most of the sites as evident from the centroid points this indicates that monsoon rainfall replenishes groundwater storage over the study area the significantly decreasing trends of rainfall over some parts of the study area along with significantly increasing trends of temperature may act as a further threat to the declining groundwater levels further research needs to be carried out to determine the exact causes of such decline and accordingly collective and site specific strategies to increase groundwater recharge should be developed this study recommends adopting mitigation measures to curb groundwater depletion construction of check dams to enhance infiltration minimizing cultivation of water intensive crops construction of artificial recharge structures and conjunctive use of groundwater and surface water are some of the measures that must be considered seriously for improving the groundwater levels the outcomes of this study will help in developing regional groundwater policies for sustainable water management 6 conclusions the changes in groundwater levels in three districts of jharkhand india are explored through ita technique the dgwl data from 24 stations during pre and post monsoon seasons during the period 1996 2018 are considered for the trend analysis the results reveal a significantly increasing trend of dgwl over nearly half the sites during both seasons this implies a chronic decline of groundwater levels over the study area ita technique is found to be a robust method as it provides visual interpretations as well as the statistical significance of the trends in a time series and has no restrictive assumptions the decline in groundwater levels may be due to climate change and or anthropogenic activities this study will be helpful to water resources managers in taking necessary

11792,this study investigates the development and application of bio waste derived adsorbents for the removal of boron from groundwater the boron removal from groundwater was explored by bio waste derived adsorbents such as roasted date pits rdps and modified roasted date pits mdps by mercaptoacetic acid the results were also compared with the commercially available adsorbents such as activated carbon and bentonite several experimental conditions including ph temperature and initial concentration were investigated various analytical techniques were used to investigate surface characterizations functional groups and morphological changes of the adsorbents via fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir brunauer emmett teller bet and scanning electron microscopy sem in addition four adsorption models are utilized to analyze the adsorption process including langmuir dubinin radushkevich freundlich and temkin the results showed that the modified roasted date pits mdps could be used as an affordable environmentally friendly and effective adsorbent for boron removal from groundwater gw negative gibbs energy δg values imply a spontaneous and favorable adsorption process which is more favorable and spontaneous at high temperatures the adsorption process was governed by positive entropy values δs which suggests that the adsorbate adsorbent complex may have undergone structural alterations or readjustments graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater treatment natural adsorbents bio waste adsorption isotherms boron 1 introduction recently qatar has embarked on the aim of becoming the most self sufficient and sustainable country in the middle east since then the agriculture and farming industries have flourished allowing the country to enhance its food output today groundwater gw is qatar s most important renewable water resource accounting for roughly 47 5 million m3 year for agricultural purposes qatar has traditionally relied on gw 92 percent of total abstraction and treated wastewater tww almost 35 percent of total production in 2015 mdps ministry of development planning and statistics 2017 the groundwater table has decreased substantially and salinity has risen as a result of 30 times more groundwater abstraction than average recharge rates mdps ministry of development planning and statistics 2018 according to previous studies qatari groundwater has total dissolved solids tds of 1000 mg l 7500 mg l causing reverse osmosis ro membrane scaling and demanding costly pre treatment procedures elsaid 2017 according to our previous research ahmad et al 2020 the quality of the gw has also deteriorated with some impurities such as metals and metalloids boron was found to be 1 28 mg l boron is a significant source of concern since it has the potential to cause toxicity in gw two natural sources include weathering of igneous rocks and leaching from sedimentary boron bearing salt deposits natural boron sources include rainfall with sea salt from ocean spray in coastal areas because it is highly volatile anthropogenic boron sources include drainage from coal mines and the mining industry semiconductor manufacturing agricultural use of fertilizers or pesticides landfill leachate petroleum products sewage effluents due to the use of sodium perborate in detergents and cosmetics glass manufacturing and fly ash hasenmueller and criss 2013 irrigation water should not have boron in values of more than 0 5 mg l for long term irrigation and 1 mg l for sensitive crops the pka of b oh 3 is 9 24 which can be rationalized by the relatively high electronegativity of ooh as compared to oh lopalco et al 2020 peters 2014 self association of peroxoboronates takes place at higher boron concentrations between 0 025 m and 0 6 m at a neutral to alkaline ph as the predominant species forming chair conformations with cyclic 6 membered dimers b2 o2 n oh 4 n 2 fig 1 shows the molecular structure of one of these dimers bhagyaraj et al 2021 peters 2014 metal complexes can be formed between boron and other metals such as nickel lead or cadmium which can make them more toxic al ghouti et al 2017 therefore removal of boron from groundwater is highly required chemical remediation is used in groundwater remediation xie et al 2018 chemical remediation on the other hand has high operational and maintenance expenses as well as sophisticated stages also it produces toxic sludge ahmad et al 2011 furthermore physicochemical gw remediation solutions such as membrane and filtration technologies including liquid membranes ultrafiltration membranes polymer membranes nanofiber membranes electro dialytic membranes and reverse osmosis come in a variety of types these various treatment techniques have their own benefits and drawbacks which include high operation and maintenance costs production of toxic by products and limited removal percentages temesgen et al 2017 biological treatment is another gw remediation technique that is being explored and developed for a variety of reasons including cost efficient limited by product production and sustainability however the drawbacks of this technique are that in addition to the biosafety issues that must be addressed the removal of pollutants from deep aquifers is not possible ogheneochuko et al 2017 to keep the system functioning consider the operation and maintenance costs as well as the removal efficiency when researching potential treatment methods esmeray and aydin 2008 shafiq et al 2019 adsorption technologies are effective in removing a variety of pollutants are practical straightforward eco friendly not complicated cost effective limited sludge production and allow for adsorbent regeneration and recovery of metals dodbiba et al 2015 ahmad et al 2011 huang et al 2016 traditional adsorbents such as activated carbon ac are costly have environmental issues due to the non biodegradable nature of silica gel and have a high regeneration cost crini et al 2018 however low adsorption selectivity for boron removal is caused by ac due to low surface active sites for boron thus several impregnated ac is utilized for boron removal from contaminated solutions guan et al 2016 the physicochemical nature of boric acid and borate showed that hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions are possible adsorption mechanisms liu et al 2012 the maximum adsorption capacity of boron by ac was obtained at a 5 5 ph value to be 3 5 mg g köse et al 2011 another study found that at an initial boron concentration of 5 mg l the maximum percentage removal was 60 obtained at a ph value of 8 9 bonilla petriciolet et al 2017 however bodzek 2015 stated that high doses of ac are required to remove 90 of boron from water furthermore bentonite clay has concerned with significant attention in metal ion pollutants treatment in aqueous solution due to its great characteristics such as the significant adsorption capacity chemical and mechanical stability large specific surface area complex porosity lamellar structure high cation exchange capacity and cost effectiveness zhao 2008 pan et al 2011 huang et al 2016 the structural formula of bentonite is defined as rx h2o 4 al2 x mgx 2 si al 4o10 oh 2 that r is the exchangeable cations of alkali and alkali earth metals between the layers bananezhad et al 2019 the study by akpomie and dawodu 2015 showed the potential of bentonite as a cost efficient and environmentally friendly adsorbent that can be used to remove manganese and nickel ions from water an increase in boron adsorption by bentonite has been noticed due to the modification on the surface of the clay with nonyl ammonium chloride which changes it from hydrophilic to hydrophobic karahan et al 2006 bentonite adsorption capacity toward boron was found to be 0 9 mg g while it was 0 09 mg g by using ac masindi et al 2015 in contrast the non conventional adsorbents including natural materials agricultural wastes and industrial by products are environment friendly easily found and cost efficient guan et al 2016 various non conventional adsorbents are utilized for water treatment for example eggshells for boron removal al ghouti and khan 2018 bentonite clay for lead removal al jlil saad 2015 banana peel for copper and lead removal vilardi et al 2018 date palm waste is of great potential for adsorption metals because it is lignocellulosic ﬁbers which consist of cellulose lignin and hemicellulose with a high number of carbon atoms of low polarity and great adsorption ahmad et al 2011 shafiq et al 2019 lignin s functional groups bind with some metals to form coordination complexes by donating a pair of electrons bonilla petriciolet et al 2017 fig 2 shows the cellulose molecules and their components a small adsorbent dosage of date pits can remove metals and it required a short contact time for equilibrium shafiq et al 2019 date pit ash has high boron removal efﬁciency 71 al ithari et al 2011 while al haddabi et al 2015 stated the maximum removal efficiency of boron by date pit ash was 47 at neutral ph date pits are characterized by having oxygen functional groups ahmad et al 2011 organics natural material sorbents were better than minerals sorbents for the boron adsorption liu et al 2012 to enhance the number of active binding sites natural sorbents require additional modifications date pits modifications could be achieved through physical pretreatment such as drying grinding and heating it is easy simple and low cost while chemical modification could be achieved by pretreatment washing with an acid such as mercaptoacetic acid an alkali such as sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide and iron salt or iron oxide mineral coating shafiq et al 2019 the equilibrium isotherm models provide parameters that describe the adsorbent adsorbate interaction different adsorption models are investigated to identify the best fitted model because no general model fits all adsorbate s adsorbent processes adsorption models give a reliable estimation of the adsorption efficiency without using a wide range of experimental data al ghouti and da ana 2020 in the current study four adsorption models namely langmuir dubinin radushkevich freundlich and temkin are used to describe the adsorption process therefore this study aims to i modify roasted date pits by mercaptoacetic acid c2h2o2s ii study the physicochemical characteristics of the prepared material and compare them with the commercially available bentonite and activated carbon ac through fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy brunauer emmett teller bet analysis and scanning electron microscopy sem iii and explore the adsorption isotherms adsorption mechanisms and routes of the newly developed adsorbent for boron adsorption from groundwater 2 methodology 2 1 adsorbent collection and preparation commercial bentonite and ac are bought from the local market the rdps adsorbent is prepared from the locally qatari date phoenix dactylifera l date pits are washed with distilled water and dried for 2 h in an oven at 65 c then it was roasted at 130 c for 3 h after that it is ground then rinsed continuously with deionized water after that the samples are dried overnight at 100 c the dried date grains are ground to obtain the desired size of about 0 25 mm 0 125 mm next the samples were sieved then the samples were preserved in sterilized containers 2 2 preparation of modified rdps fig 3 illustrates the preparation of the modified rdps firstly the roasted date pits powder about 50 g was soaked with h2so4 100 ml 98 w w for half an hour and kept overnight yadav et al 2013 then it is washed with distilled water centrifuged and dried naoh solution 200 ml 1 m was added to resulted date pits with continuous mixing for 60 min then mercaptoacetic acid maa c2h2o2s 1 m also known as thioglycolic acid tga was added with continuous mixing for 3 h to convert hydroxyl groups to mercapto groups also known as a thiol group or a sulfhydryl group sh and then allowed to stand for overnight then the product was filtered washed centrifuged and dried at 100 с overnight 2 3 characterization of the adsorbents the morphological characteristics of the prepared adsorbents were determined using sem while the functional groups present on the surface of the adsorbents were investigated using ftir ft ir ft nir spectrometer spectrum 400 ftir analysis is conducted using perkinelmer 400 spectrum instrument universal attenuated total reflectance uatr the absorbance spectra are obtained in the 4000 cm 1 400 cm 1 range the surface area and pore size distribution of the adsorbents were determined using bet model aim sizer am301 2 4 batch adsorption experiments of boron various factors were investigated including ph 2 4 6 8 and 10 initial concentration 5 10 15 20 30 40 50 60 80 and 100 mg l and temperature 25 35 and 45 c a 0 05 g of the adsorbent roasted date pits rdps modified roasted date pits mdps bentonite activated carbon ac was added to 50 ml boric acid of various concentrations and then were shaken at 165 rpm for 24 h which we consider it as the equilibrium time at a temperature controlled shaker after that inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms was used to determine the concentration of boron after filtering the samples the boric acid stock solution of 100 mg l was prepared by adding 0 572 g of boric acid into 1 l distilled water and then different dilutions 5 10 15 20 30 40 50 60 80 and 100 mg l were prepared the ph was adjusted by using hcl 0 05 m for acidic ph values and naoh 0 05 m for basic ph values 2 5 adsorption isotherms modeling adsorption isotherm involves data from batch adsorption experiments such as a series of equilibrium concentrations with respect to the resulting adsorption efficiency the adsorption capacities qe and percentage of removal are calculated by equations 1 and 2 respectively al ghouti and da ana 2020 1 qe ci ce v m 2 percentage removal c i c e c i 100 where c i is initial concentration mg l and c e is equilibrium concentration mg l m is the adsorbent s mass g and v is the solution s volume l in the current study four adsorption isotherms were used to describe the adsorption process namely langmuir isotherm model freundlich isotherm model dubinin radushkevich isotherm model and temkin isotherm model fig 4 illustrates the linear equation constants and adsorption parameters of the studied isotherm models 2 6 thermodynamic studies the determination of the thermodynamic parameters is critical for understanding the adsorption process because they help in determining whether the adsorption is favorable spontaneous endothermic or exothermic al ghouti and da ana 2020 the negative of δg indicates that the adsorption is spontaneous however if δh is a positive value then the reaction is endothermic and if δh is negative then it is an exothermic reaction the positive δs value indicates the adsorbent s affinity towards the adsorbate the adsorption thermodynamic parameters could be given from equations 3 5 then the values of δh and δs could be found by van t hoff plot of ln ke versus 1 t al ghouti and da ana 2020 3 δg rt lnk a 4 δg δh tδs 5 lnk a δ h r t δ s r where the gas constant 8 314 j mol k is denoted as r the temperature in kelvin k is denoted as t and the equilibrium thermodynamic constant is denoted as ka which could be calculated from equation 6 6 k a q e c e thus it is reasonable to use the langmuir isotherm constant to estimate the unitless value of k a bonilla petriciolet et al 2017 2 7 statistical analysis analysis of variance was used to statistically test the results of the adsorption experiment because the experimental designs are completely randomized design crd anova for two factors using microsoft excel 2016 is utilized to investigate the link between temperature and initial boron content because the experiment was a single factor experiment anova for a single factor was utilized to investigate the ph effect on boron adsorption capacity in addition the chi squared test χ 2 and the coefficient of determination r2 is used to investigate the best fit adsorption isotherm model 3 results and discussion 3 1 physical and chemical characteristics of adsorbates metal ions with higher electronegativity have the ability to adsorb easier than metals with lower electronegativity and metals with higher hydrolysis constants improve the capacity of adsorption whereas bigger ionic radius metals have lower density charge and weaker electrostatic attraction leading to the reduction in the adsorptive capacity minceva et al 2008 to find a possible attractive site between boron and adsorbents characteristic properties such as crystal radius and equilibrium constants for adsorbate ions are shown in table 1 moreover it is essential to study the physicochemical properties of adsorbents to better understand the adsorption process and have insight into the governing mechanisms of adsorption 3 2 brunauer emmett teller bet analysis surface area parameters for different adsorbents were conducted using bet using nitrogen physisorption as shown in table 2 below the order of surface area for the adsorbent is shown as ac bentonite mdps rdps ac shows the highest surface area of 178 79 m2 g while rdps show the lowest surface area of 2 84 m2 g while bentonite and mdps were 34 7 and 29 7 m2 g respectively the pore volume for different adsorbents is ordered as bentonite ac rdps mdps ac shows the highest pore volume 0 187 cm3 g while rdps show the lowest pore volume 0 0837 cm3 g while bentonite and mdps were 0 187 and 0 0980 cm3 g respectively the adsorption microporous volume follows the order ac bentonite rdps mdps in which ac has the highest microporous volume 0 078 cm3 g while rdps show the lowest microporous volume 0 0100 cm3 g while bentonite and mdps were 0 0146 cm3 g and 0 0140 cm3 g respectively the order of average pore radius for different adsorbents is as bentonite mdps rdps ac bentonite has mesopores diameters which is the highest average pore radius 10 81 nm mdps and rdps have mesopores diameters of 5 7 nm and 6 31 nm respectively while ac shows micropores diameters such that the average pore radius is the lowest 1 88 nm comparative results to the current results are shown by other studies al ghouti et al 2017 stated that the rdps had a total surface area of 99 76 m2 g and cumulative pore volume of 0 14 cm3 g while alhamed 2009 stated that rdps had a total surface area of 1 2 m2 g and cumulative pore volume of 0 23 cm3 g while the total surface area for ac was 359 m2 g in the study of djilani et al 2015 besides the study of andrade et al 2018 showed that the total surface area and cumulative pore volume of bentonite were 28 m2 g 3 3 fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir analysis fig 5 shows the peaks that are approximately assigned for different functional groups for ac bentonite rdps and mdps the identification of the functional group from the absorbance spectra is adopted from the study by socrates 2015 and smith and dent 2019 where υ is stretching β is in plane bending and γ is out of plane bending fig 5a shows that ac is characterized by different hydroxyl groups such as β oh at 1440 cm 1 and υ oh at 2887 cm 1 and 3650 cm 1 in addition to oxygenated groups such as at 2349 cm 1 1205 cm 1 furthermore fig 6 illustrates the oxygenated groups on the surface of ac bentonite is characterized by hydroxyl groups like υ oh at 3629 cm 1 and 3567 cm 1 in addition to oxygenated groups such as at 2349 cm 1 and 1117 cm 1 as shown in fig 5b moreover fig 7 represents the silanol and aluminol functional groups and their protonation and deprotonation states on the edge of bentonite bananezhad et al 2019 strawn 2021 moreover rdps are characterized by hydroxyl groups such as υ oh at 3356 cm 1 and 3567 cm 1 in addition to oxygenated groups such as at 1374 cm 1 and 1744 cm 1 as shown in fig 5c fig 5d shows that the modification of date pits has different new functional groups the mdps have oxygen groups mainly carbonyl alcohol and aromatic groups such as at 1370 cm 1 which is assigned to so and at 1703 cm 1 which is assigned to stretching vibrations of υ co ester groups suggesting that mercapto acetate functions with thiol groups are presented moreover the peak at 650 cm 1 implied the weak absorbance of υ s h groups which represent the thiol group in addition to s h bond stretching appearing at 2539 cm 1 a similar finding of adding sulfur functional group at peaks 613 cm 1 1014 cm 1 and 1075 cm 1 after date pits modification is found by al ghouti et al 2019 as shown in fig 5d thiol groups were introduced into the adsorbent date pits in addition to hydroxyl groups such as υ oh at 2921 cm 1 and 3650 cm 1 the adsorption process is significantly enhanced due to the presence of these functional groups on the adsorbent surface the results of the available functional groups on the surface of the date pits such as alcohol o h aldehyde ketone ester co and alcohol ester c o are compared with the reported study by al ghouti et al 2010 al ghouti et al 2017 3 4 scanning electron microscopy sem analysis sem is a significant analytical technique that is extensively utilized to analyze the adsorbent surface morphology fig 8 shows sem images that demonstrate the morphology pore structure and homogeneity of ac bentonite rdps and mdps before and after boron adsorption due to the preparation procedure and mechanical grinding all adsorbents had irregular forms and sharp edges the surface structure of bentonite was less rough and smoother than that of other adsorbents both adsorbents ac and mdps have a rougher surface structure with more pores and edges than bentonite and rdps thus the chemical modification increased the adsorbent surface area that further enhancing the capacity of the adsorption process ac and mdps have diverse pore sizes and shapes that are narrow and confined which facilitate capturing the different adsorbates the very tiny pores that characterized ac are mainly because of the activation process and the successive release of volatile organic species while rdps show larger pores with a random arrangement that facilitates the adsorption on the surface these findings are in support of the bet surface area results the existence of fine particles on the adsorbent s outer surface is also demonstrated impurities detected in the original rdps could be due to the presence of such debris the elimination of such organic contaminants may have been aided by heat treatment and roasting and hence their appearance is less on mdps surface the morphology of the ac and rdps particles was similar to that observed in the study by al ghouti et al 2017 it is clear from the after adsorption images that ac and mdps have a high number of pores that indicate a significant capacity for trapping adsorbates the change in the adsorbent structure is also shown as the small pores are reduced while the large pores are increased which indicates a possibility of different adsorption mechanisms in addition the structure is smoothed for ac rdps and mdps after the adsorption process compared with the relatively rough and irregular surfaces before the adsorption the rough and irregular surfaces indicated a higher adsorption capacity by trapping the adsorbate 3 5 effect of ph the adsorption of metal ions from aqueous solutions is highly dependent on the solution ph as it determines the hydrogen and hydroxyl ion concentrations al ghouti et al 2017 fig 9 shows boron adsorption efficiency under different ph values the boron adsorption efficiency was about 31 65 for bentonite at ph 6 about 31 6 for ac at ph 6 and about 31 8 for mdps at ph8 30 75 and 29 35 at ph 2 and ph 6 respectively for rdps fig 10 a illustrates an example of the reaction of boron adsorption onto bentonite moreover since boron adsorption is affected by ph conditions which can alter adsorbent surface properties and the dominant boron species accessible in the aqueous solution the result suggests that a weak acid solution ph 6 was effective for boron adsorption fig 10b shows different pathways for the dissociation of boric acid since boric acid has a pka value of 9 24 so b oh 3 is the dominant species at ph 9 whereas at ph more than 9 borate b oh 4 is the dominant species al ghouti and khan 2018 borate is negatively charged it is electrostatically attracted with hydrogen ions while it is electrostatically repulsed with hydroxyl ions it is well known that changes in ph alter the degree of ionization and the surface charge of adsorbents hence boron adsorbent could have different mechanisms such as ion exchange electrostatic interactions and other chemical bindings besides the physical adsorption fig 10d represents the adsorption mechanism of boric acid onto rdps as mentioned above at weak acidic conditions ac offered a higher adsorption efficiency in comparison to rdps and mdps while in a neutral environment it only reaches around 30 removal efficiency at a strong acidic condition ph 2 the removal efficiency is decreased using mdps due to the electrostatic repulsion between the boric acid b oh 3 with the protonation hydroxyl and carbonyl functional groups al ghouti et al 2010 additionally the presence of chloride ions competes with boron ions on the positive adsorption sites however the presence of excess chloride ions at a low ph value caused a high boron removal efficiency due to cl interaction with the anion functional groups on the adsorbent surface hence cl attracting boric acid b oh 3 the increase of boron adsorption by ac and mdps with increasing the ph of the solution could be due to the complexation reaction between the borate b oh 4 and oh on the adsorbent s surface on the contrary at higher alkalinity conditions adsorption capacity decreased due to the competition for the active adsorption sites between the dominant species of boron borate b oh 4 and hydroxyl ions 3 6 influence of initial concentration as shown in fig 11 the adsorption of boron is decreased when the initial concentration is 100 mg l for all adsorbents as a result of the unavailability of vacant sites table 4 represents the adsorption capacity obtained by all used adsorbents for the removal of boron our results showed that when the initial boron concentration was 30 mg l the highest removal efficiency was 36 using mdps 50 using rdps at 40 mg l 18 using ac at 10 mg l and 54 using bentonite at 30 mg l fig 12 illustrates the adsorption mechanism of boron by bentonite the high adsorption capacity at low concentrations is attributed to the availability of unoccupied adsorption sites the increased removal efficiency was obtained as a result of increasing boron concentration furthermore increasing the boron concentration resulted in enhanced boron diffusion into the inner pores in addition it is shown that there is a fluctuating trend of increasing and decreasing the adsorption capacity as a consequence of the active sites heterogeneity and potential chemical bindings such as surface complexation and or mono di and tri coordination of boron the adsorbent s surface had several different functional groups such as hydroxyl ether and carbonyl hence considerably influence the adsorption mechanisms the fluctuation trend of increasing and decreasing bromide ions adsorption by rdps was also observed by al ghouti et al 2017 3 7 effect of temperature on boron removal table 3 shows the effect of temperature on the adsorption of boron using ac bentonite rdps and mdps fig 13 illustrates the influence of temperature values 25 35 and 45 c on boron adsorption using ac bentonite rdps and mdps respectively the adsorption efficiency of boron increases at 45 c using ac rdps and mdps the maximum adsorption efficiency reached 91 for ac 72 for mdps and 46 for rdps while the adsorption efficiency of boron increases at 35 c using bentonite that reached the maximum adsorption efficiency of 66 the highest adsorption capacity of ac was obtained at 45 c with an adsorption capacity of 54 75 mg g 27 35 mg g for rdp and 50 75 mg g for bentonite at 35 c while mdps were had adsorption capacity of 53 mg g at 45 c the increase in adsorption efficiency with temperature is attributed to the increase in viscosity however the removal efficiency decreased at 25 c because of the low boron mobility than at higher temperatures which could prevent it from adsorption at active adsorption sites at 25 c the adsorption efficiency decreased to 18 for ac and 36 using mdps while the adsorption efficiency decreases to 40 at 35 c using the rdps 3 8 adsorption isotherm model four adsorption models were utilized to explore the adsorption process langmuir dubinin radushkevich freundlich and temkin and their parameters are summarized in table 4 the determination of the r2 coefficient and chi square χ2 is used to find the best fit model for the experimental data the coefficient of determination r2 and x2 is calculated for each model using equations 7 and 8 respectively 7 r 2 1 i 1 n q i e x p q i m o d 2 i 1 n q i e x p q i e x p m e a n 2 1 s s e s s t 8 χ 2 i 1 n q i e x p q i m o d 2 q i m o d where q i e x p and q i m o d are the equilibrium capacity mg g taken from the experimental observed and model predicted data respectively n is the number of sample sizes sst is the sum of the square of total deviation and sse is the sum of square error bonilla petriciolet et al 2019 the r2 value is sensitive to outliers which could mislead in fitting the model thus χ 2 is also utilized to determine the good fit model critical chi p value for n 10 is 18 31 at α 0 05 and 23 21 at α 0 01 if the χ 2 is lower than the p value the null hypothesis is not rejected and it is concluded that there is no sufficient evidence that the experimental value is different from the model value the non fitted plot of the langmuir model for boron adsorption using ac and rdps showed two different linear lines one line is at low concentrations and the other is at high concentrations this indicates the heterogeneous adsorption in which the highest adsorption energy sites are adsorbed first and then the second adsorption energies are created allowing more adsorption at high concentrations the creation of the second adsorption site is explained by the high concentration of adsorbate that creates pressure on the adsorbent surface and forces the adsorbates into the internal surface and pores in addition it could be explained by the formation of new adsorption sites due to the pressure force that removes blocks that hinder the adsorbates from entering the pores al ghouti et al 2010 temkin isotherm model is the best fit to describe the adsorption of boron by bentonite at 45 c r2 0 73 and χ 2 19 the adsorption of boron by mdps at 35 c r2 0 91 and χ 2 3 5 and the adsorption of boron by rdps at 45 c r2 0 83 and χ 2 9 3 freundlich isotherm model describes well the adsorption of boron by mdps at 35 c r2 0 86 and χ 2 42 3 9 thermodynamic study table 5 shows the thermodynamic parameters for boron adsorption to understand the adsorption process thermodynamic parameters are required thermodynamic studies estimate standard gibbs free energy change δg standard enthalpy change δh and standard entropy change δs these parameters aid in verifying the favorability spontaneity endothermicity or exothermicity of the adsorption process in addition it helps to investigate the adsorption nature such as physical adsorption or chemical adsorption al ghouti and da ana 2020 physical adsorption is an exothermic process that is characterized by the heat of adsorption lower than 20 kj mol for van der waals and it is from 20 kj mol to 80 kj mol for electrostatic interaction while it is from 80 kj mol to 450 kj mol for chemical adsorption bonilla petriciolet et al 2017 the estimation of the adsorption thermodynamic parameters is found by plotting 1 t versus ln b where b is langmuir isotherm constant or ln kf where kf is freundlich isotherm constant depending on the applicability of the model the adsorption of boron on ac at 25 c 35 c and 45 c showed negative values for free energy that indicated a spontaneous and favorable adsorption process the value of δg is increased for higher temperatures showing more favorable and spontaneous adsorption at high temperatures however the positive value of δh inferred that experiment favored an endothermic pathway and the magnitude of δh from 150 kj mol to 180 kj mol can give an idea that electrostatic interaction and chemical adsorption occur between the adsorbent and adsorbate in relation to the positive entropy values that suggest dissociative adsorption and the possibility of some structural changes or readjustments in the adsorbate adsorbent that forms an active complex finally tδs contributes more than δh thus the adsorption is an entropy controlled process 3 10 real gw adsorption experiments three real gw samples were used to study the adsorption of boron using ac bentonite rdps and mdps more details about the characteristics of the used gw and its metal content can be found in our previous publication ahmad et al 2020 the concentrations of boron for the three studied gw samples are gw sample 1 4 523 mg l gw sample 2 4 101 mg l and gw sample 3 1 502 mg l the adsorption experiment has been conducted at ph 7 to compare the result with real water ph mean value of 7 3 fig 14 presents the boron adsorption capacity from gw samples at 25 c and 35 c the adsorption of boron decreased with the increase in boron concentration in the gw samples due to the competition with other pollutants such as molybdenum and lithium available in the gw on the active sites the highest percent of boron removal is in gw sample 3 due to the availability of active sites for boron adsorption the maximum percent of boron removal at 25 c is 44 using rdps with an adsorption capacity of 13 34 mg g followed by bentonite ac and mdps with 42 40 and 39 respectively the adsorption capacity obtained by bentonite was 13 4 by ac 12 28 and by mdps 13 42 mg g the adsorption of boron decreases at 35 c in the samples that have low boron concentration while it increases at 35 c for high concentration samples due to increasing boron ions mobility that bombarded with some adsorbed ions and the hence restructure of the adsorption ions the maximum percent of boron removal at 35 c is 40 using mdps followed by rdps ac and bentonite with 38 37 and 36 respectively the obtained adsorption capacity was 13 42 mg g for mdps 13 34 mg g for rdps 12 28 mg g by ac and 13 4 mg g for bentonite in a slightly alkaline aqueous solution the dominant species of boron are borate anions b oh 4 as shown by the equilibrium reaction equation 9 9 h 3 bo 3 h 2 o b oh 4 h date pits consist of about 17 5 hemicellulose 11 0 lignin and 42 5 cellulose al ghouti et al 2010 lignin is considered as the cementing matrix that holds cellulose and hemicellulose units together while cellulose and hemicellulose contain oxygenated functional groups such as hydroxyl ether and carbonyl hawari et al 2014 this is supported by the ftir results that showed the availability of the different oxygenated functional groups such as hydroxyl carboxyl and thiol groups that indicate the possibility of chemical adsorption mechanisms besides the physical adsorption physical adsorption is supported by the physical analysis results using sem and bet that showed the high surface area and the pores volume of ac and mdps adsorbents that enhanced the adsorption capacity while the availability of the negative active functional groups indicates chemical adsorption mechanisms such as hydrogen bond electrostatic interaction and or complexation thus the proposed adsorption mechanisms onto the mdps active sites are dispersion forces known as van der waal s forces electrostatic interaction and or complexation the b oh 4 anions are repelled with negatively charged functional groups the proposed mechanisms for b oh 4 adsorption is when cellulose and or lignin capture free proton during the complexing of borate by functional groups such as hydroxyl which then interact with borate ion through a covalent attachment and form a coordination complex fig 15 illustrates the schematic diagram of boron adsorption onto mdps 3 11 statistical analysis the anova single factor test was conducted to test the influence of ph on boron adsorption using ac bentonite rdps and mdps there is no significant difference between the absorbates concentrations and ph value as the f fcritical and p value 0 05 and the null hypothesis of equal means is accepted the two factor anova with replication test was conducted to test the relation between temperature and concentration using ac bentonite rdps and mdps boron concentrations are not significantly different between different temperatures because the p value 0 05 in addition there is a highly significant difference between column the adsorbents namely ac bentonite rdps and mdps as the f fcritical and p value 0 05 4 conclusion the use of mdps to remove boron from groundwater was found to be an efficient adsorption approach date pits are agricultural waste thus it has environmental and economic benefits to use as adsorbents the ph initial adsorbate concentration and temperature were all investigated to optimize the effectiveness of the adsorbent process it was discovered that ph 6 has a substantial impact on the adsorption process since it changes the interaction of the adsorbate with the adsorbent s surface moreover the adsorption process mdps was favorable indicating the spontaneity and endothermicity of the process the adsorption of boron onto mdps was successful due to the presence of different oxygenated functional groups as confirmed by ftir analysis thus this work showed that mdps are valuable for remediating boron from groundwater it is indicated by the negative values of the free energy that at high temperatures the adsorption process is spontaneous and more favorable the positive entropy values that controlled the adsorption process show that the adsorbate adsorbent complex may undergo some structural changes or readjustments declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

11792,this study investigates the development and application of bio waste derived adsorbents for the removal of boron from groundwater the boron removal from groundwater was explored by bio waste derived adsorbents such as roasted date pits rdps and modified roasted date pits mdps by mercaptoacetic acid the results were also compared with the commercially available adsorbents such as activated carbon and bentonite several experimental conditions including ph temperature and initial concentration were investigated various analytical techniques were used to investigate surface characterizations functional groups and morphological changes of the adsorbents via fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir brunauer emmett teller bet and scanning electron microscopy sem in addition four adsorption models are utilized to analyze the adsorption process including langmuir dubinin radushkevich freundlich and temkin the results showed that the modified roasted date pits mdps could be used as an affordable environmentally friendly and effective adsorbent for boron removal from groundwater gw negative gibbs energy δg values imply a spontaneous and favorable adsorption process which is more favorable and spontaneous at high temperatures the adsorption process was governed by positive entropy values δs which suggests that the adsorbate adsorbent complex may have undergone structural alterations or readjustments graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater treatment natural adsorbents bio waste adsorption isotherms boron 1 introduction recently qatar has embarked on the aim of becoming the most self sufficient and sustainable country in the middle east since then the agriculture and farming industries have flourished allowing the country to enhance its food output today groundwater gw is qatar s most important renewable water resource accounting for roughly 47 5 million m3 year for agricultural purposes qatar has traditionally relied on gw 92 percent of total abstraction and treated wastewater tww almost 35 percent of total production in 2015 mdps ministry of development planning and statistics 2017 the groundwater table has decreased substantially and salinity has risen as a result of 30 times more groundwater abstraction than average recharge rates mdps ministry of development planning and statistics 2018 according to previous studies qatari groundwater has total dissolved solids tds of 1000 mg l 7500 mg l causing reverse osmosis ro membrane scaling and demanding costly pre treatment procedures elsaid 2017 according to our previous research ahmad et al 2020 the quality of the gw has also deteriorated with some impurities such as metals and metalloids boron was found to be 1 28 mg l boron is a significant source of concern since it has the potential to cause toxicity in gw two natural sources include weathering of igneous rocks and leaching from sedimentary boron bearing salt deposits natural boron sources include rainfall with sea salt from ocean spray in coastal areas because it is highly volatile anthropogenic boron sources include drainage from coal mines and the mining industry semiconductor manufacturing agricultural use of fertilizers or pesticides landfill leachate petroleum products sewage effluents due to the use of sodium perborate in detergents and cosmetics glass manufacturing and fly ash hasenmueller and criss 2013 irrigation water should not have boron in values of more than 0 5 mg l for long term irrigation and 1 mg l for sensitive crops the pka of b oh 3 is 9 24 which can be rationalized by the relatively high electronegativity of ooh as compared to oh lopalco et al 2020 peters 2014 self association of peroxoboronates takes place at higher boron concentrations between 0 025 m and 0 6 m at a neutral to alkaline ph as the predominant species forming chair conformations with cyclic 6 membered dimers b2 o2 n oh 4 n 2 fig 1 shows the molecular structure of one of these dimers bhagyaraj et al 2021 peters 2014 metal complexes can be formed between boron and other metals such as nickel lead or cadmium which can make them more toxic al ghouti et al 2017 therefore removal of boron from groundwater is highly required chemical remediation is used in groundwater remediation xie et al 2018 chemical remediation on the other hand has high operational and maintenance expenses as well as sophisticated stages also it produces toxic sludge ahmad et al 2011 furthermore physicochemical gw remediation solutions such as membrane and filtration technologies including liquid membranes ultrafiltration membranes polymer membranes nanofiber membranes electro dialytic membranes and reverse osmosis come in a variety of types these various treatment techniques have their own benefits and drawbacks which include high operation and maintenance costs production of toxic by products and limited removal percentages temesgen et al 2017 biological treatment is another gw remediation technique that is being explored and developed for a variety of reasons including cost efficient limited by product production and sustainability however the drawbacks of this technique are that in addition to the biosafety issues that must be addressed the removal of pollutants from deep aquifers is not possible ogheneochuko et al 2017 to keep the system functioning consider the operation and maintenance costs as well as the removal efficiency when researching potential treatment methods esmeray and aydin 2008 shafiq et al 2019 adsorption technologies are effective in removing a variety of pollutants are practical straightforward eco friendly not complicated cost effective limited sludge production and allow for adsorbent regeneration and recovery of metals dodbiba et al 2015 ahmad et al 2011 huang et al 2016 traditional adsorbents such as activated carbon ac are costly have environmental issues due to the non biodegradable nature of silica gel and have a high regeneration cost crini et al 2018 however low adsorption selectivity for boron removal is caused by ac due to low surface active sites for boron thus several impregnated ac is utilized for boron removal from contaminated solutions guan et al 2016 the physicochemical nature of boric acid and borate showed that hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions are possible adsorption mechanisms liu et al 2012 the maximum adsorption capacity of boron by ac was obtained at a 5 5 ph value to be 3 5 mg g köse et al 2011 another study found that at an initial boron concentration of 5 mg l the maximum percentage removal was 60 obtained at a ph value of 8 9 bonilla petriciolet et al 2017 however bodzek 2015 stated that high doses of ac are required to remove 90 of boron from water furthermore bentonite clay has concerned with significant attention in metal ion pollutants treatment in aqueous solution due to its great characteristics such as the significant adsorption capacity chemical and mechanical stability large specific surface area complex porosity lamellar structure high cation exchange capacity and cost effectiveness zhao 2008 pan et al 2011 huang et al 2016 the structural formula of bentonite is defined as rx h2o 4 al2 x mgx 2 si al 4o10 oh 2 that r is the exchangeable cations of alkali and alkali earth metals between the layers bananezhad et al 2019 the study by akpomie and dawodu 2015 showed the potential of bentonite as a cost efficient and environmentally friendly adsorbent that can be used to remove manganese and nickel ions from water an increase in boron adsorption by bentonite has been noticed due to the modification on the surface of the clay with nonyl ammonium chloride which changes it from hydrophilic to hydrophobic karahan et al 2006 bentonite adsorption capacity toward boron was found to be 0 9 mg g while it was 0 09 mg g by using ac masindi et al 2015 in contrast the non conventional adsorbents including natural materials agricultural wastes and industrial by products are environment friendly easily found and cost efficient guan et al 2016 various non conventional adsorbents are utilized for water treatment for example eggshells for boron removal al ghouti and khan 2018 bentonite clay for lead removal al jlil saad 2015 banana peel for copper and lead removal vilardi et al 2018 date palm waste is of great potential for adsorption metals because it is lignocellulosic ﬁbers which consist of cellulose lignin and hemicellulose with a high number of carbon atoms of low polarity and great adsorption ahmad et al 2011 shafiq et al 2019 lignin s functional groups bind with some metals to form coordination complexes by donating a pair of electrons bonilla petriciolet et al 2017 fig 2 shows the cellulose molecules and their components a small adsorbent dosage of date pits can remove metals and it required a short contact time for equilibrium shafiq et al 2019 date pit ash has high boron removal efﬁciency 71 al ithari et al 2011 while al haddabi et al 2015 stated the maximum removal efficiency of boron by date pit ash was 47 at neutral ph date pits are characterized by having oxygen functional groups ahmad et al 2011 organics natural material sorbents were better than minerals sorbents for the boron adsorption liu et al 2012 to enhance the number of active binding sites natural sorbents require additional modifications date pits modifications could be achieved through physical pretreatment such as drying grinding and heating it is easy simple and low cost while chemical modification could be achieved by pretreatment washing with an acid such as mercaptoacetic acid an alkali such as sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide and iron salt or iron oxide mineral coating shafiq et al 2019 the equilibrium isotherm models provide parameters that describe the adsorbent adsorbate interaction different adsorption models are investigated to identify the best fitted model because no general model fits all adsorbate s adsorbent processes adsorption models give a reliable estimation of the adsorption efficiency without using a wide range of experimental data al ghouti and da ana 2020 in the current study four adsorption models namely langmuir dubinin radushkevich freundlich and temkin are used to describe the adsorption process therefore this study aims to i modify roasted date pits by mercaptoacetic acid c2h2o2s ii study the physicochemical characteristics of the prepared material and compare them with the commercially available bentonite and activated carbon ac through fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy brunauer emmett teller bet analysis and scanning electron microscopy sem iii and explore the adsorption isotherms adsorption mechanisms and routes of the newly developed adsorbent for boron adsorption from groundwater 2 methodology 2 1 adsorbent collection and preparation commercial bentonite and ac are bought from the local market the rdps adsorbent is prepared from the locally qatari date phoenix dactylifera l date pits are washed with distilled water and dried for 2 h in an oven at 65 c then it was roasted at 130 c for 3 h after that it is ground then rinsed continuously with deionized water after that the samples are dried overnight at 100 c the dried date grains are ground to obtain the desired size of about 0 25 mm 0 125 mm next the samples were sieved then the samples were preserved in sterilized containers 2 2 preparation of modified rdps fig 3 illustrates the preparation of the modified rdps firstly the roasted date pits powder about 50 g was soaked with h2so4 100 ml 98 w w for half an hour and kept overnight yadav et al 2013 then it is washed with distilled water centrifuged and dried naoh solution 200 ml 1 m was added to resulted date pits with continuous mixing for 60 min then mercaptoacetic acid maa c2h2o2s 1 m also known as thioglycolic acid tga was added with continuous mixing for 3 h to convert hydroxyl groups to mercapto groups also known as a thiol group or a sulfhydryl group sh and then allowed to stand for overnight then the product was filtered washed centrifuged and dried at 100 с overnight 2 3 characterization of the adsorbents the morphological characteristics of the prepared adsorbents were determined using sem while the functional groups present on the surface of the adsorbents were investigated using ftir ft ir ft nir spectrometer spectrum 400 ftir analysis is conducted using perkinelmer 400 spectrum instrument universal attenuated total reflectance uatr the absorbance spectra are obtained in the 4000 cm 1 400 cm 1 range the surface area and pore size distribution of the adsorbents were determined using bet model aim sizer am301 2 4 batch adsorption experiments of boron various factors were investigated including ph 2 4 6 8 and 10 initial concentration 5 10 15 20 30 40 50 60 80 and 100 mg l and temperature 25 35 and 45 c a 0 05 g of the adsorbent roasted date pits rdps modified roasted date pits mdps bentonite activated carbon ac was added to 50 ml boric acid of various concentrations and then were shaken at 165 rpm for 24 h which we consider it as the equilibrium time at a temperature controlled shaker after that inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms was used to determine the concentration of boron after filtering the samples the boric acid stock solution of 100 mg l was prepared by adding 0 572 g of boric acid into 1 l distilled water and then different dilutions 5 10 15 20 30 40 50 60 80 and 100 mg l were prepared the ph was adjusted by using hcl 0 05 m for acidic ph values and naoh 0 05 m for basic ph values 2 5 adsorption isotherms modeling adsorption isotherm involves data from batch adsorption experiments such as a series of equilibrium concentrations with respect to the resulting adsorption efficiency the adsorption capacities qe and percentage of removal are calculated by equations 1 and 2 respectively al ghouti and da ana 2020 1 qe ci ce v m 2 percentage removal c i c e c i 100 where c i is initial concentration mg l and c e is equilibrium concentration mg l m is the adsorbent s mass g and v is the solution s volume l in the current study four adsorption isotherms were used to describe the adsorption process namely langmuir isotherm model freundlich isotherm model dubinin radushkevich isotherm model and temkin isotherm model fig 4 illustrates the linear equation constants and adsorption parameters of the studied isotherm models 2 6 thermodynamic studies the determination of the thermodynamic parameters is critical for understanding the adsorption process because they help in determining whether the adsorption is favorable spontaneous endothermic or exothermic al ghouti and da ana 2020 the negative of δg indicates that the adsorption is spontaneous however if δh is a positive value then the reaction is endothermic and if δh is negative then it is an exothermic reaction the positive δs value indicates the adsorbent s affinity towards the adsorbate the adsorption thermodynamic parameters could be given from equations 3 5 then the values of δh and δs could be found by van t hoff plot of ln ke versus 1 t al ghouti and da ana 2020 3 δg rt lnk a 4 δg δh tδs 5 lnk a δ h r t δ s r where the gas constant 8 314 j mol k is denoted as r the temperature in kelvin k is denoted as t and the equilibrium thermodynamic constant is denoted as ka which could be calculated from equation 6 6 k a q e c e thus it is reasonable to use the langmuir isotherm constant to estimate the unitless value of k a bonilla petriciolet et al 2017 2 7 statistical analysis analysis of variance was used to statistically test the results of the adsorption experiment because the experimental designs are completely randomized design crd anova for two factors using microsoft excel 2016 is utilized to investigate the link between temperature and initial boron content because the experiment was a single factor experiment anova for a single factor was utilized to investigate the ph effect on boron adsorption capacity in addition the chi squared test χ 2 and the coefficient of determination r2 is used to investigate the best fit adsorption isotherm model 3 results and discussion 3 1 physical and chemical characteristics of adsorbates metal ions with higher electronegativity have the ability to adsorb easier than metals with lower electronegativity and metals with higher hydrolysis constants improve the capacity of adsorption whereas bigger ionic radius metals have lower density charge and weaker electrostatic attraction leading to the reduction in the adsorptive capacity minceva et al 2008 to find a possible attractive site between boron and adsorbents characteristic properties such as crystal radius and equilibrium constants for adsorbate ions are shown in table 1 moreover it is essential to study the physicochemical properties of adsorbents to better understand the adsorption process and have insight into the governing mechanisms of adsorption 3 2 brunauer emmett teller bet analysis surface area parameters for different adsorbents were conducted using bet using nitrogen physisorption as shown in table 2 below the order of surface area for the adsorbent is shown as ac bentonite mdps rdps ac shows the highest surface area of 178 79 m2 g while rdps show the lowest surface area of 2 84 m2 g while bentonite and mdps were 34 7 and 29 7 m2 g respectively the pore volume for different adsorbents is ordered as bentonite ac rdps mdps ac shows the highest pore volume 0 187 cm3 g while rdps show the lowest pore volume 0 0837 cm3 g while bentonite and mdps were 0 187 and 0 0980 cm3 g respectively the adsorption microporous volume follows the order ac bentonite rdps mdps in which ac has the highest microporous volume 0 078 cm3 g while rdps show the lowest microporous volume 0 0100 cm3 g while bentonite and mdps were 0 0146 cm3 g and 0 0140 cm3 g respectively the order of average pore radius for different adsorbents is as bentonite mdps rdps ac bentonite has mesopores diameters which is the highest average pore radius 10 81 nm mdps and rdps have mesopores diameters of 5 7 nm and 6 31 nm respectively while ac shows micropores diameters such that the average pore radius is the lowest 1 88 nm comparative results to the current results are shown by other studies al ghouti et al 2017 stated that the rdps had a total surface area of 99 76 m2 g and cumulative pore volume of 0 14 cm3 g while alhamed 2009 stated that rdps had a total surface area of 1 2 m2 g and cumulative pore volume of 0 23 cm3 g while the total surface area for ac was 359 m2 g in the study of djilani et al 2015 besides the study of andrade et al 2018 showed that the total surface area and cumulative pore volume of bentonite were 28 m2 g 3 3 fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir analysis fig 5 shows the peaks that are approximately assigned for different functional groups for ac bentonite rdps and mdps the identification of the functional group from the absorbance spectra is adopted from the study by socrates 2015 and smith and dent 2019 where υ is stretching β is in plane bending and γ is out of plane bending fig 5a shows that ac is characterized by different hydroxyl groups such as β oh at 1440 cm 1 and υ oh at 2887 cm 1 and 3650 cm 1 in addition to oxygenated groups such as at 2349 cm 1 1205 cm 1 furthermore fig 6 illustrates the oxygenated groups on the surface of ac bentonite is characterized by hydroxyl groups like υ oh at 3629 cm 1 and 3567 cm 1 in addition to oxygenated groups such as at 2349 cm 1 and 1117 cm 1 as shown in fig 5b moreover fig 7 represents the silanol and aluminol functional groups and their protonation and deprotonation states on the edge of bentonite bananezhad et al 2019 strawn 2021 moreover rdps are characterized by hydroxyl groups such as υ oh at 3356 cm 1 and 3567 cm 1 in addition to oxygenated groups such as at 1374 cm 1 and 1744 cm 1 as shown in fig 5c fig 5d shows that the modification of date pits has different new functional groups the mdps have oxygen groups mainly carbonyl alcohol and aromatic groups such as at 1370 cm 1 which is assigned to so and at 1703 cm 1 which is assigned to stretching vibrations of υ co ester groups suggesting that mercapto acetate functions with thiol groups are presented moreover the peak at 650 cm 1 implied the weak absorbance of υ s h groups which represent the thiol group in addition to s h bond stretching appearing at 2539 cm 1 a similar finding of adding sulfur functional group at peaks 613 cm 1 1014 cm 1 and 1075 cm 1 after date pits modification is found by al ghouti et al 2019 as shown in fig 5d thiol groups were introduced into the adsorbent date pits in addition to hydroxyl groups such as υ oh at 2921 cm 1 and 3650 cm 1 the adsorption process is significantly enhanced due to the presence of these functional groups on the adsorbent surface the results of the available functional groups on the surface of the date pits such as alcohol o h aldehyde ketone ester co and alcohol ester c o are compared with the reported study by al ghouti et al 2010 al ghouti et al 2017 3 4 scanning electron microscopy sem analysis sem is a significant analytical technique that is extensively utilized to analyze the adsorbent surface morphology fig 8 shows sem images that demonstrate the morphology pore structure and homogeneity of ac bentonite rdps and mdps before and after boron adsorption due to the preparation procedure and mechanical grinding all adsorbents had irregular forms and sharp edges the surface structure of bentonite was less rough and smoother than that of other adsorbents both adsorbents ac and mdps have a rougher surface structure with more pores and edges than bentonite and rdps thus the chemical modification increased the adsorbent surface area that further enhancing the capacity of the adsorption process ac and mdps have diverse pore sizes and shapes that are narrow and confined which facilitate capturing the different adsorbates the very tiny pores that characterized ac are mainly because of the activation process and the successive release of volatile organic species while rdps show larger pores with a random arrangement that facilitates the adsorption on the surface these findings are in support of the bet surface area results the existence of fine particles on the adsorbent s outer surface is also demonstrated impurities detected in the original rdps could be due to the presence of such debris the elimination of such organic contaminants may have been aided by heat treatment and roasting and hence their appearance is less on mdps surface the morphology of the ac and rdps particles was similar to that observed in the study by al ghouti et al 2017 it is clear from the after adsorption images that ac and mdps have a high number of pores that indicate a significant capacity for trapping adsorbates the change in the adsorbent structure is also shown as the small pores are reduced while the large pores are increased which indicates a possibility of different adsorption mechanisms in addition the structure is smoothed for ac rdps and mdps after the adsorption process compared with the relatively rough and irregular surfaces before the adsorption the rough and irregular surfaces indicated a higher adsorption capacity by trapping the adsorbate 3 5 effect of ph the adsorption of metal ions from aqueous solutions is highly dependent on the solution ph as it determines the hydrogen and hydroxyl ion concentrations al ghouti et al 2017 fig 9 shows boron adsorption efficiency under different ph values the boron adsorption efficiency was about 31 65 for bentonite at ph 6 about 31 6 for ac at ph 6 and about 31 8 for mdps at ph8 30 75 and 29 35 at ph 2 and ph 6 respectively for rdps fig 10 a illustrates an example of the reaction of boron adsorption onto bentonite moreover since boron adsorption is affected by ph conditions which can alter adsorbent surface properties and the dominant boron species accessible in the aqueous solution the result suggests that a weak acid solution ph 6 was effective for boron adsorption fig 10b shows different pathways for the dissociation of boric acid since boric acid has a pka value of 9 24 so b oh 3 is the dominant species at ph 9 whereas at ph more than 9 borate b oh 4 is the dominant species al ghouti and khan 2018 borate is negatively charged it is electrostatically attracted with hydrogen ions while it is electrostatically repulsed with hydroxyl ions it is well known that changes in ph alter the degree of ionization and the surface charge of adsorbents hence boron adsorbent could have different mechanisms such as ion exchange electrostatic interactions and other chemical bindings besides the physical adsorption fig 10d represents the adsorption mechanism of boric acid onto rdps as mentioned above at weak acidic conditions ac offered a higher adsorption efficiency in comparison to rdps and mdps while in a neutral environment it only reaches around 30 removal efficiency at a strong acidic condition ph 2 the removal efficiency is decreased using mdps due to the electrostatic repulsion between the boric acid b oh 3 with the protonation hydroxyl and carbonyl functional groups al ghouti et al 2010 additionally the presence of chloride ions competes with boron ions on the positive adsorption sites however the presence of excess chloride ions at a low ph value caused a high boron removal efficiency due to cl interaction with the anion functional groups on the adsorbent surface hence cl attracting boric acid b oh 3 the increase of boron adsorption by ac and mdps with increasing the ph of the solution could be due to the complexation reaction between the borate b oh 4 and oh on the adsorbent s surface on the contrary at higher alkalinity conditions adsorption capacity decreased due to the competition for the active adsorption sites between the dominant species of boron borate b oh 4 and hydroxyl ions 3 6 influence of initial concentration as shown in fig 11 the adsorption of boron is decreased when the initial concentration is 100 mg l for all adsorbents as a result of the unavailability of vacant sites table 4 represents the adsorption capacity obtained by all used adsorbents for the removal of boron our results showed that when the initial boron concentration was 30 mg l the highest removal efficiency was 36 using mdps 50 using rdps at 40 mg l 18 using ac at 10 mg l and 54 using bentonite at 30 mg l fig 12 illustrates the adsorption mechanism of boron by bentonite the high adsorption capacity at low concentrations is attributed to the availability of unoccupied adsorption sites the increased removal efficiency was obtained as a result of increasing boron concentration furthermore increasing the boron concentration resulted in enhanced boron diffusion into the inner pores in addition it is shown that there is a fluctuating trend of increasing and decreasing the adsorption capacity as a consequence of the active sites heterogeneity and potential chemical bindings such as surface complexation and or mono di and tri coordination of boron the adsorbent s surface had several different functional groups such as hydroxyl ether and carbonyl hence considerably influence the adsorption mechanisms the fluctuation trend of increasing and decreasing bromide ions adsorption by rdps was also observed by al ghouti et al 2017 3 7 effect of temperature on boron removal table 3 shows the effect of temperature on the adsorption of boron using ac bentonite rdps and mdps fig 13 illustrates the influence of temperature values 25 35 and 45 c on boron adsorption using ac bentonite rdps and mdps respectively the adsorption efficiency of boron increases at 45 c using ac rdps and mdps the maximum adsorption efficiency reached 91 for ac 72 for mdps and 46 for rdps while the adsorption efficiency of boron increases at 35 c using bentonite that reached the maximum adsorption efficiency of 66 the highest adsorption capacity of ac was obtained at 45 c with an adsorption capacity of 54 75 mg g 27 35 mg g for rdp and 50 75 mg g for bentonite at 35 c while mdps were had adsorption capacity of 53 mg g at 45 c the increase in adsorption efficiency with temperature is attributed to the increase in viscosity however the removal efficiency decreased at 25 c because of the low boron mobility than at higher temperatures which could prevent it from adsorption at active adsorption sites at 25 c the adsorption efficiency decreased to 18 for ac and 36 using mdps while the adsorption efficiency decreases to 40 at 35 c using the rdps 3 8 adsorption isotherm model four adsorption models were utilized to explore the adsorption process langmuir dubinin radushkevich freundlich and temkin and their parameters are summarized in table 4 the determination of the r2 coefficient and chi square χ2 is used to find the best fit model for the experimental data the coefficient of determination r2 and x2 is calculated for each model using equations 7 and 8 respectively 7 r 2 1 i 1 n q i e x p q i m o d 2 i 1 n q i e x p q i e x p m e a n 2 1 s s e s s t 8 χ 2 i 1 n q i e x p q i m o d 2 q i m o d where q i e x p and q i m o d are the equilibrium capacity mg g taken from the experimental observed and model predicted data respectively n is the number of sample sizes sst is the sum of the square of total deviation and sse is the sum of square error bonilla petriciolet et al 2019 the r2 value is sensitive to outliers which could mislead in fitting the model thus χ 2 is also utilized to determine the good fit model critical chi p value for n 10 is 18 31 at α 0 05 and 23 21 at α 0 01 if the χ 2 is lower than the p value the null hypothesis is not rejected and it is concluded that there is no sufficient evidence that the experimental value is different from the model value the non fitted plot of the langmuir model for boron adsorption using ac and rdps showed two different linear lines one line is at low concentrations and the other is at high concentrations this indicates the heterogeneous adsorption in which the highest adsorption energy sites are adsorbed first and then the second adsorption energies are created allowing more adsorption at high concentrations the creation of the second adsorption site is explained by the high concentration of adsorbate that creates pressure on the adsorbent surface and forces the adsorbates into the internal surface and pores in addition it could be explained by the formation of new adsorption sites due to the pressure force that removes blocks that hinder the adsorbates from entering the pores al ghouti et al 2010 temkin isotherm model is the best fit to describe the adsorption of boron by bentonite at 45 c r2 0 73 and χ 2 19 the adsorption of boron by mdps at 35 c r2 0 91 and χ 2 3 5 and the adsorption of boron by rdps at 45 c r2 0 83 and χ 2 9 3 freundlich isotherm model describes well the adsorption of boron by mdps at 35 c r2 0 86 and χ 2 42 3 9 thermodynamic study table 5 shows the thermodynamic parameters for boron adsorption to understand the adsorption process thermodynamic parameters are required thermodynamic studies estimate standard gibbs free energy change δg standard enthalpy change δh and standard entropy change δs these parameters aid in verifying the favorability spontaneity endothermicity or exothermicity of the adsorption process in addition it helps to investigate the adsorption nature such as physical adsorption or chemical adsorption al ghouti and da ana 2020 physical adsorption is an exothermic process that is characterized by the heat of adsorption lower than 20 kj mol for van der waals and it is from 20 kj mol to 80 kj mol for electrostatic interaction while it is from 80 kj mol to 450 kj mol for chemical adsorption bonilla petriciolet et al 2017 the estimation of the adsorption thermodynamic parameters is found by plotting 1 t versus ln b where b is langmuir isotherm constant or ln kf where kf is freundlich isotherm constant depending on the applicability of the model the adsorption of boron on ac at 25 c 35 c and 45 c showed negative values for free energy that indicated a spontaneous and favorable adsorption process the value of δg is increased for higher temperatures showing more favorable and spontaneous adsorption at high temperatures however the positive value of δh inferred that experiment favored an endothermic pathway and the magnitude of δh from 150 kj mol to 180 kj mol can give an idea that electrostatic interaction and chemical adsorption occur between the adsorbent and adsorbate in relation to the positive entropy values that suggest dissociative adsorption and the possibility of some structural changes or readjustments in the adsorbate adsorbent that forms an active complex finally tδs contributes more than δh thus the adsorption is an entropy controlled process 3 10 real gw adsorption experiments three real gw samples were used to study the adsorption of boron using ac bentonite rdps and mdps more details about the characteristics of the used gw and its metal content can be found in our previous publication ahmad et al 2020 the concentrations of boron for the three studied gw samples are gw sample 1 4 523 mg l gw sample 2 4 101 mg l and gw sample 3 1 502 mg l the adsorption experiment has been conducted at ph 7 to compare the result with real water ph mean value of 7 3 fig 14 presents the boron adsorption capacity from gw samples at 25 c and 35 c the adsorption of boron decreased with the increase in boron concentration in the gw samples due to the competition with other pollutants such as molybdenum and lithium available in the gw on the active sites the highest percent of boron removal is in gw sample 3 due to the availability of active sites for boron adsorption the maximum percent of boron removal at 25 c is 44 using rdps with an adsorption capacity of 13 34 mg g followed by bentonite ac and mdps with 42 40 and 39 respectively the adsorption capacity obtained by bentonite was 13 4 by ac 12 28 and by mdps 13 42 mg g the adsorption of boron decreases at 35 c in the samples that have low boron concentration while it increases at 35 c for high concentration samples due to increasing boron ions mobility that bombarded with some adsorbed ions and the hence restructure of the adsorption ions the maximum percent of boron removal at 35 c is 40 using mdps followed by rdps ac and bentonite with 38 37 and 36 respectively the obtained adsorption capacity was 13 42 mg g for mdps 13 34 mg g for rdps 12 28 mg g by ac and 13 4 mg g for bentonite in a slightly alkaline aqueous solution the dominant species of boron are borate anions b oh 4 as shown by the equilibrium reaction equation 9 9 h 3 bo 3 h 2 o b oh 4 h date pits consist of about 17 5 hemicellulose 11 0 lignin and 42 5 cellulose al ghouti et al 2010 lignin is considered as the cementing matrix that holds cellulose and hemicellulose units together while cellulose and hemicellulose contain oxygenated functional groups such as hydroxyl ether and carbonyl hawari et al 2014 this is supported by the ftir results that showed the availability of the different oxygenated functional groups such as hydroxyl carboxyl and thiol groups that indicate the possibility of chemical adsorption mechanisms besides the physical adsorption physical adsorption is supported by the physical analysis results using sem and bet that showed the high surface area and the pores volume of ac and mdps adsorbents that enhanced the adsorption capacity while the availability of the negative active functional groups indicates chemical adsorption mechanisms such as hydrogen bond electrostatic interaction and or complexation thus the proposed adsorption mechanisms onto the mdps active sites are dispersion forces known as van der waal s forces electrostatic interaction and or complexation the b oh 4 anions are repelled with negatively charged functional groups the proposed mechanisms for b oh 4 adsorption is when cellulose and or lignin capture free proton during the complexing of borate by functional groups such as hydroxyl which then interact with borate ion through a covalent attachment and form a coordination complex fig 15 illustrates the schematic diagram of boron adsorption onto mdps 3 11 statistical analysis the anova single factor test was conducted to test the influence of ph on boron adsorption using ac bentonite rdps and mdps there is no significant difference between the absorbates concentrations and ph value as the f fcritical and p value 0 05 and the null hypothesis of equal means is accepted the two factor anova with replication test was conducted to test the relation between temperature and concentration using ac bentonite rdps and mdps boron concentrations are not significantly different between different temperatures because the p value 0 05 in addition there is a highly significant difference between column the adsorbents namely ac bentonite rdps and mdps as the f fcritical and p value 0 05 4 conclusion the use of mdps to remove boron from groundwater was found to be an efficient adsorption approach date pits are agricultural waste thus it has environmental and economic benefits to use as adsorbents the ph initial adsorbate concentration and temperature were all investigated to optimize the effectiveness of the adsorbent process it was discovered that ph 6 has a substantial impact on the adsorption process since it changes the interaction of the adsorbate with the adsorbent s surface moreover the adsorption process mdps was favorable indicating the spontaneity and endothermicity of the process the adsorption of boron onto mdps was successful due to the presence of different oxygenated functional groups as confirmed by ftir analysis thus this work showed that mdps are valuable for remediating boron from groundwater it is indicated by the negative values of the free energy that at high temperatures the adsorption process is spontaneous and more favorable the positive entropy values that controlled the adsorption process show that the adsorbate adsorbent complex may undergo some structural changes or readjustments declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

11793,this study aimed to examine whether conservation agriculture can be applied across the eastern gangetic plains egp as a strategy to ensure that groundwater use for irrigation remains sustainable as demands increase the study analysed the groundwater balance in the egp at sub region district and field scales using modflow a water balance model and the apsim model respectively and evaluated the current state of groundwater development aiming to address sustainability concerns long term groundwater use and aquifer reserves reveal the significant influence of groundwater extraction on the current state of the water balance in the indian and northwest bangladesh sub regions accelerated extraction may result in groundwater mining in areas where potential maximum recharge has already been achieved or exceeded while further development of groundwater may be possible in areas where actual recharge is still less than potential recharge at district level the water supply versus demand situation shows a large annual surplus in the east but a deficit in the west conservation agriculture ca and alternate wetting and drying awd irrigation practice exert varying impacts on water demand crop transpiration ep is generally higher in ca compared to conventional tillage ct while soil evaporation es is similar in both practices net evapotranspiration although very similar in both practices is generally greater in ca awd has a limited effect on es but reduces the percolation rate and therefore irrigation requirement of boro rice in conclusion the cause effect associations between irrigation water use and groundwater sustainability are not spatially uniform across the egp nor will they likely be so under further agricultural development associated with increased water demands the study suggests that the cause effect interactions between irrigation water use and groundwater sustainability cannot be generalized across the egp and therefore ca or awd should not be applied uniformly across the region keywords irrigation groundwater sustainability suitable approach 1 introduction the eastern gangetic plains egp comprising areas in the states of uttar pradesh bihar and west bengal of india the terai region of nepal and the northwest region rajshahi and rangpur divisions of bangladesh fig 1 is one of the most populous regions on earth the combined population of uttar pradesh bihar and west bengal in india was about 395 million in 2011 national commission on population 2020 while in the same year that of the rangpur and rajshahi divisions was about 34 million bangladesh bureau of statistics 2015 and in terai it was about 13 million open data panel nepal 2021 the population growth rates are similar in the three sub regions of the egp and their populations are expected to peak between the year 2050 and 2060 at about 20 percent more than the present population united nations department of economic and social affairs population division 2019 in addition to the requirement of feeding an additional 20 people increasing economic development is likely to lead to demands for a greater proportion of animal protein and fat in the diet gerbens leenes et al 2010 in south asia as well as globally the changing diet is a significant factor in increasing the land requirement for food production kastner et al 2012 food production in the egp and more broadly in the indo gangetic plains igp as a whole relies on irrigation particularly in the dry season agricultural development from pakistan to bangladesh in the igp particularly the rise of dry season irrigated agriculture has already led to concerns over falling groundwater tables and the resulting unsustainable use of groundwater the concerns are great in pakistan archer et al 2010 qureshi et al 2010 northwest india punjab and haryana humphreys et al 2010 and parts of northwest bangladesh particularly the barind tract dey et al 2017 kirby et al 2015 mainuddin et al 2020a mojid et al 2019 peña arancibia et al 2020 the combined concerns of greater water requirements for the future due to the growing population with its associated changing diet and the present concerns of unsustainable groundwater use lead to greater concern over the availability of water for irrigation in the future moreover in addition to exacerbating the unsustainable use of groundwater in parts of the egp groundwater use in some other parts like the terai plains in nepal that are currently sustainable might become unsustainable with increased use one potential solution to this dilemma could be the adoption of resource conservation technologies like conservation agriculture ca which comprises three main elements fao 2017 minimum soil disturbance no tillage maintenance of soil cover and diversification of crop species ca improves soil condition and maintains soil moisture with resulting reduced irrigation requirements without yield penalties and possibly with increasing yields e g jat et al 2019 islam et al 2019 dixon et al 2020 dutta et al 2020 jat et al 2020a jat et al 2020b alternate wetting and drying awd irrigation practice in rice cropping in which there is no continuous rice pond but rather periods of ponding alternating with periods of no pond is promoted as another resource conservation mainly water saving technique which also reduces irrigation requirements in some cases of more limited dry periods without yield penalties bouman et al 2007 zheng et al 2020 note awd is often given different names in the literature zheng et al 2020 for example call it shallow adjusting irrigation however the reduction in irrigation water use mentioned in the foregoing papers does not necessarily translate into a reduction in groundwater decline as pointed out by bouman et al 2007 the reduced irrigation application may be matched by a reduced percolation as egp is largely an alluvial system where deep percolation of rain and irrigation water enters the fresh groundwater pool and is therefore not a loss from the system thus while less water is taken from groundwater storage less is returned there as well and the overall impact of the changed practice may not differ much from that of conventional cropping practices balwinder singh et al 2015 what matters from the perspective of sustainable groundwater use in the egp is whether ca or awd has changed the actual evapotranspiration et of the system without a deleterious effect on yield few studies have addressed this issue directly as noted in a recent review the potential of water saving technologies to actually save water is less certain than might appear at the first glance a common assumption in the promotion of such technologies is that reducing water inputs per unit of output is equivalent to reducing water use this assumption may not be true mojid and mainuddin 2021 ahmad et al 2007a 2007b 2014 and perry et al 2017 give evidence that it may not the literature is mixed regarding the impacts of awd irrigation on rice et with reports that et is reduced compared to conventional flooded management zheng et al 2020 or that it makes no difference reavis et al 2021 it is likely that the cropping environment plays a significant role in this determination furthermore while a decline in groundwater tables in the region is commonly attributed to pumping of groundwater for irrigation this may not be a complete explanation of the cause asoka et al 2017 demonstrated that whereas pumping is the main factor in northwest india declining precipitation is a more important factor than pumping in north central india peña arancibia et al 2020 similarly show that in northwest bangladesh declining rainfall smaller areas and shorter periods of standing water floods and changes in landscape infiltration properties due to a large increase in the areas puddled for dry season rice with the aim of puddling being to reduce drainage of soil water below the root zone may all be contributing factors to the decline of groundwater tables indeed bonsor et al 2017 suggest that the region of the lower ganges and mid brahmaputra is highly resilient to groundwater abstraction and that further development may be possible in some areas rushton et al 2020 noted that the declining water tables discussed above in the barind tract of northwest bangladesh are not necessarily a sign of unsustainable use but rather may be a change with pumping to a new equilibrium groundwater level in which there remains significant recharge to maintain the level in its new position however macdonald et al 2015 suggest that in much of the indo gangetic basin degradation of groundwater quality is a greater threat to future use than the depletion of the groundwater table finally the egp is not a uniform entity it is generally drier in the west than the east also in the west wheat cropping dominates in the dry season whereas in the east dry season rice dominates this variation calls into question whether a single solution such as a particular resource conservation practice can be applied across the whole region to address sustainable water use in the face of rising demands understanding these interactions requires investigation of regional water balances at multiple scales including 1 water balance at the regional scale where hydrology is governed by basin characteristics climate and other regional determinants 2 water balance at the district or catchment scale where climate predominantly governs the hydrology which could also be affected by anthropogenic water use and 3 water balance at the farm to field scale where hydrology largely constrains irrigation water use and agricultural production and to a smaller extent vice versa the aim of this paper is to examine whether conservation agriculture ca can be applied across the egp to ensure that groundwater use for irrigation remains sustainable in the face of increasing demand the novel contribution of this study is to show that preliminary desktop analyses at a range of scales lead to robust conclusions that ca and similar techniques should not be applied uniformly across this varied region we report preliminary analyses done at the farm scale district scale and regional scale across the egp and examine the state of the water balance at the three scales we assess the likely consequences for the regional hydrology that might result from changed practices like increases in water use and the implementation of farm scale water saving measures we also assess gaps in knowledge of the water balance of the egp the egp is taken in this study to include northwest bangladesh the indian states of bihar uttar pradesh and west bengal and the terai plains of nepal fig 1 while only the eastern part of uttar pradesh may be in the egp below we shall make use of statistics which apply to the whole state 2 regional setting climate agriculture and irrigation in the egp the egp region has a monsoon climate with rainfall occurring mostly in the wet season june to october rainfall varies from about 800 mm in the west around kanpur in uttar pradesh to more than 2600 mm in the east cooch behar in west bengal fig 1 potential evapotranspiration varies from about 1600 mm in the west to about 1200 mm in the east the egp is intensively used for agriculture with the area under cultivation being half or more of the total area in most parts of the region table 1 the northwest bangladesh and uttar pradesh of india are the most intensively cultivated and the most intensively irrigated areas and use groundwater for most of their irrigation noting that the statistics are somewhat out of date for northwest bangladesh and for source of irrigation water for west bengal about one third of the total area or roughly half the cultivated area is irrigated in bihar and west bengal whereas more than half the total area is irrigated in northwest bangladesh and uttar pradesh tubewell i e groundwater irrigation dominates in northwest bangladesh and uttar pradesh and to a lesser extent in bihar in west bengal groundwater use and surface water use are almost equal nearly one third of the irrigated area is classified as other although january 2012 record indicates that this includes pumping directly from rivers the major crop areas for recent years in northwest bangladesh nepal and india are provided in fig 2 the two most important crops by area in bihar and uttar pradesh are aman rice wet season and wheat dry season in west bengal and northwest bangladesh the corresponding crops are aman rice and boro rice except in the terai of nepal the total areas of crops shown in fig 2 exceeds the cultivated areas given in table 1 this arises because two or sometimes more crops are grown in the same field each year the total area of crops in northwest bangladesh fig 1 is about twice the cultivated area table 1 indicating that on average the cropping intensity is about 200 in uttar pradesh the cropping intensity is about 160 in west bengal it is about 140 and in bihar it is about 110 3 methods 3 1 groundwater balance the groundwater balance in three different sub regions of the egp fig 1 was analysed to evaluate the status quo of groundwater development the three sub regions considered are the terai plains of nepal parts of the egp within india uttar pradesh bihar and west bengal and northwest bangladesh the country boundaries were chosen for demarcating the sub regions primarily because of the available data pertained to the respective countries however the status quo of groundwater development also differed considerably across these sub regions numerical groundwater models were used for analysing groundwater balance for the indian and northwest bangladesh sub regions estimates of major recharge and discharge components were collated from the groundwater resources development board s recent study to analyse groundwater balance of the terai plains 3 1 1 groundwater in the terai plains of nepal estimates of recharge from several sources were used by the groundwater resource development board gwrdb 2019 of nepal to estimate the dynamic groundwater reserve of the terai plains similarly estimates of the groundwater use for irrigation and industrial and domestic uses were also quantified from different sources these estimates were used to interpret the status of groundwater development given the lack of consistent data sets across the terai plains and limited development of groundwater water balance estimation using numerical modelling was not warranted for this sub region 3 1 2 numerical modelling of groundwater balance for the indian and northwest bangladesh sub regions unlike the terai plains groundwater has been extensively developed in the indian and northwest bangladesh sub regions of the egp we used a regional scale numerical groundwater model of the ganges basin alluvial aquifer single layer built and calibrated by janardhanan et al 2020 to compute groundwater balance and groundwater level trends in the indian sub region the regional scale model represented the alluvial aquifer system of the ganges basin in a single layer numerical groundwater model built by using the modflow code the model area is discretised into finite difference cells in 322 rows and 665 columns each cell is 2500 m wide and 2500 m long in the x y directions vertically the aquifer is represented in a single layer that extends from the ground surface to 500 m below the ground surface a similar single layer modflow model janardhanan et al 2021 was used for the northwest bangladesh this sub region was discretised into 1 5 km cells using 210 rows and 122 columns in the model grid the representations of major water balance components such as recharge groundwater use for consumptive demand irrigation and crop water use surface water groundwater sw gw interaction and hydraulic characteristics in both the models are described below 3 1 2 1 recharge groundwater recharge was estimated for the indian sub region as a fraction of rainfall with the fraction determined by calibration in the northwest bangladesh sub region where deep drainage estimates were available from water balance modelling recharge was estimated as a fraction of deep drainage with the fraction determined during model calibration for the indian sub region topography slopes from the northwest to the southeast and rainfall distribution also in general increases from the west to the east hence recharge zones were identified based on these spatial characteristics districts were identified as recharge zones in the northwest bangladesh sub region model as topography remains largely flat across this sub region recharge parameters for each zone were estimated during model calibration 3 1 2 2 evapotranspiration one of the major mechanisms of groundwater discharge in the ganges basin is via evapotranspiration which comprises root water uptake by the native vegetation as well as groundwater use by irrigated agriculture the spatially and temporally variable groundwater contribution to evapotranspiration and consumptive demand was modelled as a fraction of the estimated total evapotranspiration and estimated by constraining the model to observed groundwater levels in the indian region of egp groundwater use for irrigation is largely unmetered and hence a reliable estimate of groundwater use for irrigation is not available past studies cgwb 2019 maheswaran et al 2016 have provided estimates of groundwater pumping due to varying irrigation efficiencies in the region there is a likelihood that a considerable portion of pumped water is returned to the water table as irrigation excess on the other hand farm scale studies conducted in several areas indicate that several crops are under irrigated in many parts of the region singh et al 2019 urfels et al 2020 thus extrapolation of limited number of pumping estimates to quantify groundwater use over the region will result in large uncertainties and lead to significant over or under estimation of groundwater use in regional models hence groundwater pumping was not directly simulated in the model instead representation of the evapotranspiration in both of the models included simulation of groundwater extraction by setting a deeper et extinction depth 3 1 2 3 surface water groundwater interaction modflow river package was used to represent surface water groundwater sw gw interaction as head dependent flux boundary condition in both models the recharge and discharge from and to the river stretches were dynamically simulated in the model using the river package 3 1 2 4 hydraulic characteristics the uncertainty in the regional variability of aquifer hydraulic characteristics such as hydraulic conductivity and specific yield was characterised by representing them as spatially variable parameters in both models the spatial parameterisation device called pilot points was used for this the pilot points of hydraulic conductivity and specific yield were included as parameters for model calibration the parameter values for each model cell were interpolated from the pilot point values this approach enabled calibrating and estimating the hydraulic properties around each pilot point by history matching to the observed groundwater levels in the vicinity 3 1 2 5 groundwater balance the calibrated groundwater models were used to analyse the long term 2001 2012 in the indian sub region and 1985 2015 in northwest bangladesh annual groundwater balance in the regional aquifers the water balance comprises major recharge and discharge components including diffuse recharge from rainfall recharge from and discharge to the rivers and consumptive groundwater use for evapotranspiration the trends in groundwater levels in the indian and northwest bangladesh sub regions were also simulated using the calibrated models 3 2 district surface water balance supply and demand to estimate the district water balances we used the surface water balance approach of ahmad 2002 and ahmad et al 2005 latter modified by ahmad et al 2020a 2020b 2021 ahmad 2002 and ahmad et al 2005 suggested that the net groundwater use in an irrigation area ingw could be computed as the deficit implied by a water balance of the land surface and given by 1 i n g w e t a p n i c w d w d t where eta is the water lost by evapotranspiration of crops and other vegetation pn is the water gained from precipitation considered as a net term after losses to runoff icw is the diversion of water into the area via canals and dw dt is the change in water stored in the area in the soil but also in other surface storages over the period being considered the advantage of the surface water balance approach is that it does not require detailed groundwater modelling or assessment and does not require information or assumptions about lateral groundwater flows ahmad et al 2005 applied the method to the rechna doab region of pakistan using spatially explicit estimates of eta derived from remotely sensed satellite data ahmad et al latter 2020a 2020b 2021 modified the idea slightly to look at a lumped surface water balance of the canal commands in pakistan given by 2 0 e t a p i c w i n g w b where p is the total rainfall and b is a balance term which is the difference between the sum of the other terms and thus forces equation 2 to sum to zero in modifying equation 1 to derive equation 2 the unknown soil water storage term dw dt is absent but implicit in the difference or balance term b we deal here with annual water balances and the change in the annual soil water storage is likely to be insignificant over the long term here we do not have access at this stage of study to time series estimates of the actual evapotranspiration or canal deliveries of irrigation water we therefore modified the approach and the equation to 3 0 p i n g w e t o b where eto is the potential evapotranspiration we have reversed the signs of the terms from equation 2 because as discussed later the meaning of trends in the balance term b becomes more intuitive a positive trend in b with the sign convention of equation 3 is an indication of a trend to a more sustainable water balance which we think intuitively as a positive outcome equation 3 is not strictly a water balance because the potential evapotranspiration is not strictly the actual amount of water that is lost by evapotranspiration however the equation can be viewed as an indicative of the balance between supply rainfall plus groundwater use and demand potential evapotranspiration where supply is in excess of demand there is likely to be runoff and modest need for irrigation where supply is less than demand there is likely to be little runoff and irrigation would lead to greater crop production in the wetter locations within the three sub regions in this study the actual evapotranspiration is likely to be only a little less than the potential evapotranspiration in two locations in the northwest bangladesh the actual evapotranspiration described in results is 88 and 93 of the potential evapotranspiration therefore in the wetter locations results based on equation 3 may be close to the actual water balance leaving the canal water term out of equation 3 is unlikely to be a concern in several of the locations in this study since there is probably little use of canal water our previous work has identified that 97 of irrigation water in northwest bangladesh is sourced from groundwater mainuddin et al 2014 2019a in other areas where supply is less than demand it is possible that the deficit is made up by canal water diverted from the rivers following ahmad et al 2020a 2020b 2021 we calculated the net groundwater use term as the annual change in groundwater levels assessed from a regression through all the groundwater data in a district done separately for pre monsoon and monsoon data for this study in which annual water balances are used we used the average of the pre monsoon and monsoon trends if the groundwater recharge and discharge are strictly one dimensional the calculation of net groundwater use as the annual change in groundwater levels is correct though the estimates may nevertheless be subject to measurement error it is probable that most recharge of the groundwater occurs through rainfall in the northern parts of the egp and so is largely one dimensional this may not be true in the districts near the ganges where subsurface lateral groundwater flow may allow drainage into or recharge from the river any subsurface lateral flows in the groundwater appear as an unaccounted loss or gain in the difference or balance term b equation 3 the balance term is a composite term that includes unaccounted losses and gains such as surface runoff or lateral subsurface flows that contribute to the change in groundwater levels and are thus implicit in the net groundwater use term the difference between actual evapotranspiration and potential evapotranspiration and observation errors in the other terms in calculating the balance term we assumed that the groundwater trend from 1996 in the indian states can be extrapolated back to 1980 the water balance was estimated for the districts fig 1 as an annual time series from 1996 to 2018 indian districts or 1985 to 2016 bangladeshi districts we considered 7 districts lakhimpur kheri kanpur in uttar pradesh purba champara bhojpur and madhubani in bihar and cooch behar and south 24 parganas in west bengal in the indian sub region and 2 districts kurigram and rajshahi in northwest bangladesh representing the different agro climatic conditions of the egp 3 2 1 data as noted in fig 2 data on crop area was obtained as follows indian states from https data gov in catalog district wise season wise crop production statistics bangladesh compiled from various sources and published in a summary form by peña arancibia et al 2020 the data have been cleaned to remove obvious gross errors bihar has some obvious missing data in the first few years fig 2 rainfall and potential evapotranspiration data were taken from the cru ts4 03 dataset available at https crudata uea ac uk cru data hrg cru ts 4 03 and described by harris et al 2014 note that the harris et al s paper strictly refers to an earlier version of the cru dataset the dataset has rainfall and potential evapotranspiration from 1900 to 2018 gridded at 0 5 intervals across the land surfaces of the globe the nearest grid point to the centre of each district was selected and the data from 1980 to 2018 was extracted for use groundwater data were obtained as follows indian states from the central groundwater board at http cgwb gov in gw data access html by clicking on ground water data download and then selecting the state and district of interest bangladesh compiled from bangladesh water development board bwdb data borehole records were screened and the data were cleaned to remove errors surfaces were fitted to the groundwater level data for each period and the average depth to the surface was calculated regressions were fitted to all the pre monsoon and monsoon data points for all districts we converted a change in the groundwater level to an equivalent change in the depth of water stored by multiplying by an assumed specific yield of 0 1 10 3 3 field scale water balance apsim crop modelling apsim the agricultural production systems simulator holzworth et al 2014 is a modelling platform for simulation of biophysical processes in cropping systems particularly those relating to the production and ecological outcomes of management practices in the face of climate risk the model has been extensively tested in diverse environments and management practices in asia with good performance demonstrated amarasingha et al 2017 gaydon et al 2017 hochman et al 2017 kabir et al 2018 laing et al 2018 in apsim the method for modelling conventional tillage ct is quite distinct from conservation agriculture ca and good differentiation between simulating the performance of each has been recently demonstrated for the egp dutta et al 2020 chaki et al 2022 the water balance and all component terms rainfall irrigation change in soil water storage runoff drainage soil evaporation crop transpiration are calculated by apsim on a daily basis based on inputs of daily climate data maximum and minimum temperatures rainfall solar radiation as well as imposed farmers management details of agronomy sowing dates crops irrigation amounts fertiliser tillage etc apsim is a dynamic daily time step model combining management and biophysical modules through a central engine to simulate cropping system performance the model simulates soil water carbon c nitrogen n and phosphorus p dynamics and their interactions in a cropping system s context potential production for a range of crops is determined using stage related radiation use efficiency rue constrained by climate and available leaf area on a daily basis this is then limited to actual biomass production by factors representing soil water n and p limitations keating et al 2003 the apsim soilwat module water balance used in this study employs a multi layer cascading philosophy following ceres jones and kiniry 1986 apsim surfaceom simulates the dynamics of above ground crop residues that are either removed from the system incorporated into the soil or left to decompose on the soil surface transformations of c and n in the soil are simulated by the apsim soiln module processes simulated as part of these transformations include n immobilization urea hydrolysis organic matter decomposition ammonification nitrification and denitrification information from apsim soilwat and apsim soiln regarding soil water and n availability are sought by apsim crop modules for limitation of crop growth on a daily basis apsim pond simulates biogeochemical processes that occur in ponded rice fields gaydon et al 2012b crop modules specifically relevant to this analysis are apsim oryza gaydon et al 2012a apsim wheat wang et al 2003 and apsim maize carberry and abrecht 1991 to simulate ca in the egp general rules followed in specifying the different practices are provided in table 2 when soils are puddled prior to the rice phase then later tilled prior to the wheat maize phase in conventional rice wheat rice maize and similar systems significant inter seasonal changes occur in soil properties gathala et al 2011 puddling reduces the effective saturated hydraulic conductivity ks and bulk density bd of the puddled soil layers whereas tillage after the rice phase increases effective ks by breaking the plow pan but reduces bd of surface soil layers these are significant input parameters in sensibly simulating rice wheat system performance gaydon et al 2012a however apsim does not currently simulate changes in these parameters in response to specified tillage events for the relevant simulated datasets in this study we found it was necessary to employ apsim manager to specify an increase in ks of the plow pan layer by 100 a doubling and a decrease in bangladesh by 5 following post rice tillage and apply the reverse change to these parameters upon puddling at the start of the subsequent rice phase following findings of gathala et al 2011 bund height apsim resettable parameter max pond was also reset to zero via apsim manager on the date of rice field drainage representing opening of the bunds and then again set to the actual experimental bund height on the occasion of pre crop bund establishment once again these are not simulated in apsim rather specified by the user apsim does however simulate the effect of tillage on soil roughness and therefore runoff and water retained on the soil surface and available for infiltration by automatically reducing the usda curve number as per specified parameters as an example we found it necessary to reduce the curve number by 10 in the case of each discing and by 5 for harrowing the curve number was reset to the default value when at least 40 mm of water was added to soil by rain or irrigation to simulate the collapse smoothing of a freshly cultivated soil surface as a result of saturation and rainfall impact balwinder singh et al 2015 we considered four sites for apsim modelling tarahara in the sunsari distract in nepal terai dogachi in purnea district of bihar and falimari in cooch behar district of west bengal in india and premtoli in rajshahi district of bangladesh fig 1 the apsim model for all sites was robustly calibrated and validated https www aciar gov au project cse 2011 077 in this water balance study we compared the performance of ca versus ct at the four sites focusing particularly on water balance terms we also compared awd irrigation and conventional irrigation for boro rice at one site premtoli at rajshahi in bangladesh the simulation was carried out for the period of 2000 2017 4 results 4 1 groundwater balance a wide range of recharge volumes between 5800 mcm and 10 745 mcm were estimated for the terai plains in nepal shreshta et al 2018 duba 1982 underpinned by these studies the dynamic groundwater reserve of the terai plains was estimated as 8800 mcm a total of 756 mcm is currently abstracted for irrigation and industrial purposes and 297 mcm for drinking water use gwrdb 2019 this implies that only 12 of the annually available groundwater resource is currently used accordingly there is a groundwater surplus of 7747 mcm which may be potentially developed based on these estimates there is a significant opportunity for groundwater development for irrigation in the terai plains however it is noteworthy that large scale development of groundwater would result in a state of groundwater balance that is different from the pre development state in the long term the plausible state of groundwater balance should be assessed for the changes in groundwater levels and other impacts to determine the sustainability groundwater is extensively developed for irrigation in the indian and northwest bangladesh sub regions of the egp calibrated groundwater models were used for simulating groundwater balance and groundwater level trends for these sub regions hydraulic properties and parameters governing recharge groundwater contribution to evapotranspiration and surface water groundwater interaction were adjusted during model calibration the simulated groundwater balances for the two corresponding sub regions are shown in fig 3 and fig 4 it is noteworthy that the estimated long term average groundwater use comprising groundwater pumping and groundwater contribution to evapotranspiration is very close to and slightly over the recharge respectively in the indian fig 3d and northwest sub regions fig 4 fig 3a c shows the modelled water balance for the three major states in the indian sub region uttar pradesh bihar and west bengal respectively the estimated recharge from rainfall varies between 232 mm and 389 mm in these states the inflow into groundwater from rivers and lateral fluxes also vary considerably across this sub region the sum of the major inflow components is balanced by the total groundwater use and other discharge components groundwater storage in the basin is in a dynamic equilibrium but there is a small declining trend for the long term average storage change in the individual states and across the basin trends in observed groundwater levels and simulated values from the calibrated groundwater model for selected bores in northwest bangladesh is shown in fig 5 declining groundwater level trend is evident for some of the bores while others have more or less steady groundwater levels all these potentially indicate that groundwater extraction has a significant influence on the current state of groundwater balance further extraction in areas where potential maximum recharge induced by groundwater extraction has already been achieved may result in groundwater mining in other areas further development may be possible however regionally there is a small rate of decline in storage estimated for both the sub regions indicating that groundwater use is unsustainable at least in some areas within the sub regions this is also indicated in the trends in observed and simulated groundwater levels in many bores in both sub regions fig 5 for northwest bangladesh and fig s1 in supplementary materials for indian sub region in fig s1 the first row a gives examples of bores that have observed declining trends in water level the second row b and third row c respectively show bores which have increasing and steady water levels groundwater balance in the indian and northwest bangladesh sub regions are similar with similar rates of recharge and groundwater use locally there could be significant variability that was not explored in this study but regionally annual groundwater use is largely in equilibrium with recharge 4 2 district surface water balance supply and demand the district water balances as an annual average from 1985 to 2015 bangladesh and 1996 to 2018 india are shown in fig 6 this figure shows that the annual average rainfall increases and the demand potential evapotranspiration decreases from the west to the east of the egp see fig s2 in supplementary materials for temporal trends for each district the annual supply of groundwater to the surface or return flow from the surface to groundwater is too small to see at the scale of the top plot in fig 6 and is presented at a 100 times greater scale in the bottom plot note that a falling groundwater table results at least partly from groundwater used in irrigation which is an inflow to the surface water balance rajshahi district in the northwest bangladesh has the largest declining water table amongst the districts assessed indicating that it has the largest contribution to the surface water supply from groundwater although small in annual terms a decline of 21 mm per year of equivalent water depth amounts to about 200 mm decline in the water table per year with an assumed specific yield of 0 1 or about 6 m over the period from 1985 to 2015 fig 6 also shows the difference between supply mainly rainfall and demand mainly potential evapotranspiration as the balance term varying from large negative in the west to large positive in the east this indicates that in the east there is a large annual surplus of water which leaves the districts as an outflow in the form of runoff in the west on the other hand there is a deficit of supply to satisfy demand and hence there is a large potential for irrigation if supply can be increased 4 3 field scale water balance the apsim modelling results are summarised in figs 7 and 8 detailed results of different sites are provided in supplementary information figs s3 s6 in supplementary materials however the same trends were evident at all sites regardless of climate and soil characteristics the crop transpiration ep is generally higher in conservation agriculture ca systems driven by increased rabi crop production under ca this is likely due to better soil structure without puddling that enhanced crop rooting and nutrition during rabi season crops gathala et al 2011 soil evaporation es is similar in ca and ct systems but less in ca crops due to increased surface residue cover this difference could be greater where a greater percentage of residues are retained in egp ca systems however the trade off between crop benefits and livestock feed appears to result in only around 25 residues retained in this region net evapotranspiration the key variable in determining water losses in these systems is therefore very similar in ca and ct practices but generally greater under ca across our simulations of site and cropping system fig 7 drainage below the root zone is greater in ca but runoff is less irrigation inputs were greater across the ca treatments driven largely by increased water percolation drainage below the crop root zone during rice cultivation these results from the increased saturated percolation rates in soils under ca practice through cessation of the puddling process the maintenance of more crop residues on the surface in ca compared to ct was not sufficient to reduce soil evaporation enough to reduce overall evapotranspiration this is applied on average and also for each individual sites and crop rotation the key message from this field scale analysis across four diverse locations and environments in the egp is that evapotranspiration is not reduced by the implementation of ca practices if anything evapotranspiration is slightly increased fig 7 right side figures awd had little effect on soil evaporation in boro rice however it did reduce drainage percolation below crop root zone and therefore irrigation requirement fig 8 this is due largely to reduced hydraulic head under awd irrigation bouman et al 2007 crop transpiration ep is determined by how productive the rice crop is and hence how much it transpires when done properly awd has minimal impact on crop production and therefore ep differences are marginal compared with conventional fully ponded rice irrigation our simulations reflect that ca boro rice is more productive than ct boro rice leading to greater ep and hence greater evapotranspiration however the practice of awd itself has little impact on evapotranspiration during boro rice season fig 8 right hand side 5 discussion the global increase in food production has exerted tremendous pressure on production linked resources like water and soil and specifically on groundwater resources the accelerating stress on groundwater in the egp has raised concerns on the sustainability of agricultural production systems this challenge is being faced both locally and regionally mojid and mainuddin 2021 several direct approaches like water saving irrigation groundwater by laws rain fed cropping groundwater recharge enhancement rainwater harvesting and virtual water import and indirect approaches like energy pricing and regulation are available and often promoted to reduce regional water use aeschbach hertig and gleeson 2012 fao 2016 however the over arching consideration from the literature and from the results presented in this paper is that climate agriculture and groundwater development vary considerably across the egp and indeed across the indo gangetic basin more widely analysis of the trends of groundwater level and groundwater balance separately for three different sub regions terai plains of nepal parts of the egp within india and northwest bangladesh of the egp based on the geography and political boundaries clearly reveals this variation the results reveal that the state of groundwater exploitation and use differs considerably across the region the long term average storage changes in regions indicate small rates of groundwater depletion this potentially indicates the stress on the regional groundwater system induced by the combination of large scale irrigation water use and other factors like changes in rainfall patterns induced by climate change and cropping patterns considerable differences are seen between the components of individual water balances however these individual water balance components like the river recharge and evapotranspiration fluxes are not independently constrained by relevant observations other than the available groundwater levels more comprehensive probabilistic approaches to the water balance are needed before conclusive inferences can be made about these individual water balance components nevertheless the dynamic equilibrium in the groundwater storage estimated for both the indian and northwest bangladesh sub regions indicates that groundwater use may be at the sustainable maximum rate or slightly over that in at least parts of these regions while increased groundwater use may be possible in other areas like the terai plains of nepal thus any policy that prescribes uniform water saving measures across the region may not be as effective as it is perceived adaptive approaches e g van der voorn et al 2012 2017 thomann et al 2020 considering uncertainties regarding climate change e g van der voorn et al 2012 miro et al 2021 will be required to achieve sustainable use without affecting the food security of the region water balance analysis reveals that extensive use of groundwater intensive crops like boro rice can potentially contribute to declining groundwater levels in some areas in the region like the barind tract of northwest bangladesh in this region groundwater recharge is constrained by the soil type and other hydrogeological characteristics even here however it appears that groundwater development may not be the sole cause of groundwater decline peña arancibia et al 2020 see also asoka et al 2017 for north central india water balance analysis at smaller spatial scales at district scale which is smaller than regional and subregional scales also shows that the annual supply of water from rainfall exceeds the potential demand in the north and east of the region around cooch behar and the northern part of northwest bangladesh exemplified by the kurigram district the district scale water balance shows that although the annual supply in these areas exceeds potential evapotranspiration there are nevertheless periods in the dry season when there is a deficit so irrigation is useful at critical times of crop growth however the overall demand for irrigation water will be modest and the excess of water supply over demand in the wet season is likely to replenish drawdown of aquifers hence there is limited scope in the northeast for impact on irrigation water volumes from reducing water consumption as evapotranspiration or from changing the source of irrigation water as the excess of annual supply over potential evapotranspiration diminishes towards south and west the dry season deficit grows and its duration lengthens thus requiring more irrigation water for crop growth this is the situation in the rajshahi area in the northwest bangladesh sub region where irrigation is associated with groundwater level decline in such areas of the egp and also in many other similar parts of the world resource conservation technologies like ca and awd are often adopted as a response to the concerns of agricultural sustainability under water deficit conditions dumanski et al 2006 fao 2018 islam et al 2019 in those areas reduction in water consumption as evapotranspiration through water savings measures would lessen the requirement for pumping and might arrest or reverse declining groundwater tables however since other factors may be partly responsible for the declining groundwater levels peña arancibia et al 2020 water saving measures alone may not necessarily achieve sustainable groundwater use several benefits of the resource conservation technologies such as reduced labour energy and nutrient use as well as reduced agrochemical leaching are scale invariant and instinctively clear pokharel et al 2018 mujeeb ur rehman et al 2011 however achieving water savings with these technologies remains uncertain at the system level since it is both a temporal and spatial scale dependent component and associated with the regional hydrologic cycle li et al 2017 perry et al 2017 a resource conservation technology which saves water by reducing percolation rates represents only a narrow local perspective of water application mojid and mainuddin 2021 and does not account for return flows to groundwater from the irrigated field resource conservation technologies can alter crop water use and consequently the regional water cycle liu et al 2016 with adverse impact on groundwater dynamics zhang et al 2014 they reduce water application in the fields with a consequent reduced lower percolation and groundwater recharge the return flow may constitute significant part of groundwater recharge ahmad et al 2002 giordano 2009 keller et al 1996 tuong et al 2005 therefore whether the reduced extraction of groundwater associated with reduced recharge increases groundwater storage or reduces it remains uncertain moa fao 2013 it is likely that large scale adoption of these technologies can lead to major decline in groundwater levels tabbal et al 2002 mays 2013 grogan et al 2017 the conclusions of rushton et al 2020 suggest that saving water by preventing deep drainage might be counter productive and possibly lead to more rapidly declining groundwater levels further west in bhojpur lakhimpur kheri and kanpur all of which have large deficits of rain to satisfy potential demand and therefore more requirement for irrigation water there is increasing scope for impact on regional hydrology of reducing water consumption as evapotranspiration or from changing the source of irrigation water finally south 24 parganas within the indian sub region in west bengal especially in locations close to the coast is a special case a key aspect of management for crop production is the management of salt mainuddin et al 2019a b 2020b 2021 remesan et al 2021 irrigation is done using fresh or less saline surface water stored in canals ponds or rivers here water saving measures are important because water of sufficient freshness becomes scarce in the later part of the dry season water saving through mulching and other techniques may be important paul et al 2020 here preventing deep drainage through less pumping or alternate wetting and drying offers real water savings as the underlying groundwater is saline even though it may not reduce evapotranspiration the impact of the resource conservation measures on regional hydrology has less to do with water quantity than water quality the apsim modelling results described in the paper reveal that at several representative sites across the egp region conservation agriculture ca and water saving techniques have some effects on the hydrology and water balance components but do not significantly affect the evapotranspiration these observations are consistent with the findings in literature as evidenced in a recent extensive review by mojid and mainuddin 2021 water saving technologies are promoted based on the assumption that a reduction in water inputs per unit of output provides an equivalent water saving however this assumption depends on the destination of the saved water and a saving of water may not always be realised a large part of the applied irrigation water percolates to the groundwater and can be reused hence percolation is not necessarily a loss keller et al 1995 apsim defines percolation as water moving vertically downwards beyond the crop root zone the apsim variable called drain in practice this percolation may not necessarily be the same as groundwater recharge as soil water storage below the bottom of crop rooting zone in other words not considered by apsim and the surface of the groundwater may exist not all of apsim s percolation may enter the groundwater this limits apsim s ability to simulate groundwater recharge per se however even though numerical differences may exist the water concerned is still not a loss from the system regardless of whether it is stored in the soil below crop roots or enters the groundwater although any work to improve irrigation efficiency is commendable babajimopoulos et al 2007 focusing on local water use efficiency alone and ignoring return flows is a misapprehension qureshi et al 2011 while there may be benefits in ca such as greater profitability primarily due to reduced costs of labour and other inputs of production dutta et al 2020 gathala et al 2021 chaki et al 2021 it is unlikely to solve regional groundwater problems everywhere similarly while not an essential component of ca awd irrigation practice can reduce groundwater extraction for irrigation and associated pumping costs but has little impact on evapotranspiration and overall groundwater dynamics mainuddin et al 2020a our study indicates that ca reduces erosion and runoff and increases soil moisture holding capacities and organic matter in the surface soil this is supported by several reports in the literature e g palm et al 2014 however our study has additionally shown that the reduced runoff in ca is matched roughly by increased drainage below the crop roots compared with conventional tillage both drainage and runoff waters are likely to ultimately re enter the water tables and aquifers and hence are not system water losses in any case this finding is also supported by keller et al 1995 water saving can only come from net reductions in water consumption as evapotranspiration except in the coastal saline areas such as in south 24 parganas or from changing the source of irrigation water and the destination of unused water similar to the farmer perspective there is likely to be less impact in either of these senses on the regional hydrology in the northeast of the egp e g cooch behar and kurigram than in the west e g kanpur however from a farmer s perspective any reduction in the use of irrigation water is a saving which will reduce costs and enhance profitability provided yields and quality of produce are not affected the trend from an excess of annual supply over demand in the northeast of the egp cooch behar and kurigram to a deficit in the west kanpur means that there is less incentive for the farmer to save water in the northeast conversely there is more to be gained from water saving measures in the west the interactions between non agricultural and agricultural water usages also vary across the spatial scales and influence water saving khan et al 2002 at large spatial scale e g basin scale reducing water use in irrigation and transferring the saved water to higher valued usages is the preferred goal this approach does not consider individual water use but evaluates return flows and approximates water use efficiencies at field and basin scales while accounting for water and analysing water use efficiencies frederiksen and perry 1995 keller et al 1995 simons et al 2020 so a clear understanding of the scale effects of water use is crucial to increase water savings loeve et al 2002 molden 1997 garrick et al 2012 jiang and wang 2019 6 conclusion a water balance analysis at the three different scales regional district and field scales suggests that while there may be some cause effect associations between irrigation water use and groundwater sustainability they cannot be generalized across the entire egp region nor is it likely that future agricultural development and increasing demands of irrigation water will have a uniform impact across the region therefore a pan basin solution like the promotion of conservation agriculture or awd irrigation practice to achieve groundwater sustainability may not be and plausibly will not be suitable across different spatial scales it is therefore important to have a comprehensive understanding of the egp s groundwater resources and their future sustainability by linking farm scale activities with the regional or basin scale the advances in remote sensing technologies and machine learning to understand land use changes and evapotranspiration and in numerical groundwater modelling to understand recharge discharge dynamics can be effectively integrated for developing such comprehensive understanding linking field and basin scale analysis this will provide options for sustainable groundwater

11793,this study aimed to examine whether conservation agriculture can be applied across the eastern gangetic plains egp as a strategy to ensure that groundwater use for irrigation remains sustainable as demands increase the study analysed the groundwater balance in the egp at sub region district and field scales using modflow a water balance model and the apsim model respectively and evaluated the current state of groundwater development aiming to address sustainability concerns long term groundwater use and aquifer reserves reveal the significant influence of groundwater extraction on the current state of the water balance in the indian and northwest bangladesh sub regions accelerated extraction may result in groundwater mining in areas where potential maximum recharge has already been achieved or exceeded while further development of groundwater may be possible in areas where actual recharge is still less than potential recharge at district level the water supply versus demand situation shows a large annual surplus in the east but a deficit in the west conservation agriculture ca and alternate wetting and drying awd irrigation practice exert varying impacts on water demand crop transpiration ep is generally higher in ca compared to conventional tillage ct while soil evaporation es is similar in both practices net evapotranspiration although very similar in both practices is generally greater in ca awd has a limited effect on es but reduces the percolation rate and therefore irrigation requirement of boro rice in conclusion the cause effect associations between irrigation water use and groundwater sustainability are not spatially uniform across the egp nor will they likely be so under further agricultural development associated with increased water demands the study suggests that the cause effect interactions between irrigation water use and groundwater sustainability cannot be generalized across the egp and therefore ca or awd should not be applied uniformly across the region keywords irrigation groundwater sustainability suitable approach 1 introduction the eastern gangetic plains egp comprising areas in the states of uttar pradesh bihar and west bengal of india the terai region of nepal and the northwest region rajshahi and rangpur divisions of bangladesh fig 1 is one of the most populous regions on earth the combined

egp and more broadly in the indo gangetic plains igp as a whole relies on irrigation particularly in the dry season agricultural development from pakistan to bangladesh in the igp particularly the rise of dry season irrigated agriculture has already led to concerns over falling groundwater tables and the resulting unsustainable use of groundwater the concerns are great in pakistan archer et al

mojid et al 2019 peña arancibia et al 2020 the combined concerns of greater water requirements for the future due to the growing population with its associated changing diet and the present concerns of unsustainable groundwater use lead to greater concern over the availability of water for irrigation in the future moreover in addition to exacerbating the unsustainable use of groundwater in parts of the egp groundwater use in some other parts like the terai plains in nepal that are currently sustainable might become unsustainable with increased use one potential solution to this dilemma could be the adoption of resource conservation technologies like conservation agriculture ca which comprises three main elements fao 2017 minimum soil disturbance no tillage maintenance of soil cover and diversification of crop species ca improves soil condition and maintains soil moisture with resulting reduced irrigation requirements without yield penalties and possibly with increasing yields e g jat et al 2019 islam et al 2019 dixon et al 2020 dutta et al 2020 jat et al 2020a jat et al 2020b alternate wetting and drying awd irrigation practice in rice cropping in which there is no continuous rice pond but rather periods of ponding alternating with periods of no pond is promoted as another resource conservation mainly water saving technique which also reduces irrigation requirements in some cases of more limited dry periods without yield penalties bouman et al 2007 zheng et al 2020 note awd is often given different names in the literature zheng et al 2020 for example call it shallow adjusting irrigation however the reduction in irrigation water use mentioned in the foregoing papers does not necessarily translate into a reduction in groundwater decline as pointed out by bouman et al 2007 the reduced irrigation application may be matched by a reduced percolation as egp is largely an alluvial system where deep percolation of rain and irrigation water enters the fresh groundwater pool and is therefore not a loss from the system thus while less water is taken from groundwater storage less is returned there as well and the overall impact of the changed practice may not differ much from that of conventional cropping practices balwinder singh et al 2015 what matters from the perspective of sustainable groundwater use in the egp is whether ca or awd has changed the actual evapotranspiration et of the system without a deleterious effect on yield few studies have addressed this issue directly as noted in a recent review the potential of water saving technologies to actually save water is less certain than might appear at the first glance a common assumption in the promotion of such technologies is that reducing water inputs per unit of output is equivalent to reducing water use this assumption may not be true mojid and mainuddin 2021 ahmad et al 2007a 2007b 2014 and perry et al 2017 give evidence that it may not the literature is mixed regarding the impacts of awd irrigation on rice et with reports that et is reduced compared to conventional flooded management zheng et al 2020 or that it makes no difference reavis et al 2021 it is likely that the cropping environment plays a significant role in this determination furthermore while a decline in groundwater tables in the region is commonly attributed to pumping of groundwater for irrigation this may not be a complete explanation of the cause asoka et al 2017 demonstrated that whereas pumping is the main factor in northwest india declining precipitation is a more important factor than pumping in north central india peña arancibia et al 2020 similarly show that in northwest bangladesh declining rainfall smaller areas and shorter periods of standing water floods and changes in landscape infiltration properties due to a large increase in the areas puddled for dry season rice with the aim of puddling being to reduce drainage of soil water below the root zone may all be contributing factors to the decline of groundwater tables indeed bonsor et al 2017 suggest that the region of the lower ganges and mid brahmaputra is highly resilient to groundwater abstraction and that further development may be possible in some areas rushton et al 2020 noted that the declining water tables discussed above in the barind tract of northwest bangladesh are not necessarily a sign of unsustainable use but rather may be a change with pumping to a new equilibrium groundwater level in which there remains significant recharge to maintain the level in its new position however macdonald et al 2015 suggest that in much of the indo gangetic basin degradation of groundwater quality is a greater threat to future use than the depletion of the groundwater table finally the egp is not a uniform entity it is generally drier in the west than the east also in the west wheat cropping dominates in the dry season whereas in the east dry season rice dominates this variation calls into question whether a single solution such as a particular resource conservation practice can be applied across the whole region to address sustainable water use in the face of rising demands understanding these interactions requires investigation of regional water balances at multiple scales including 1 water balance at the regional scale where hydrology is governed by basin characteristics climate and other regional determinants 2 water balance at the district or catchment scale where climate predominantly governs the hydrology which could also be affected by anthropogenic water use and 3 water balance at the farm to field scale where hydrology largely constrains irrigation water use and agricultural production and to a smaller extent vice versa the aim of this paper is to examine whether conservation agriculture ca can be applied across the egp to ensure that groundwater use for irrigation remains sustainable in the face of increasing demand the novel contribution of this study is to show that preliminary desktop analyses at a range of scales lead to robust conclusions that ca and similar techniques should not be applied uniformly across this varied region we report preliminary analyses done at the farm scale district scale and regional scale across the egp and examine the state of the water balance at the three scales we assess the likely consequences for the regional hydrology that might result from changed practices like increases in water use and the implementation of farm scale water saving measures we also assess gaps in knowledge of the water balance of the egp the egp is taken in this study to include northwest bangladesh the indian states of bihar uttar pradesh and west bengal and the terai plains of nepal fig 1 while only the eastern part of uttar pradesh may be in the egp below we shall make use of statistics which apply to the whole state 2 regional setting climate agriculture and irrigation in the egp the egp region has a monsoon climate with rainfall occurring mostly in the wet season june to october rainfall varies from about 800 mm in the west around kanpur in uttar pradesh to more than 2600 mm in the east cooch behar in west bengal fig 1 potential evapotranspiration varies from about 1600 mm in the west to about 1200 mm in the east the egp is intensively used for agriculture with the area under cultivation being half or more of the total area in most parts of the region table 1 the northwest bangladesh and uttar pradesh of india are the most intensively cultivated and the most intensively irrigated areas and use groundwater for most of their irrigation noting that the statistics are somewhat out of date for northwest bangladesh and for source of irrigation water for west bengal about one third of the total area or roughly half the cultivated area is irrigated in bihar and west bengal whereas more than half the total area is irrigated in northwest bangladesh and uttar pradesh tubewell i e groundwater irrigation dominates in northwest bangladesh and uttar pradesh and to a lesser extent in bihar in west bengal groundwater use and surface water use are almost equal nearly one third of the irrigated area is classified as other although january 2012 record indicates that this includes pumping directly from rivers the major crop areas for recent years in northwest bangladesh nepal and india are provided in fig 2 the two most important crops by area in bihar and uttar pradesh are aman rice wet season and wheat dry season in west bengal and northwest bangladesh the corresponding crops are aman rice and boro rice except in the terai of nepal the total areas of crops shown in fig 2 exceeds the cultivated areas given in table 1 this arises because two or sometimes more crops are grown in the same field each year the total area of crops in northwest bangladesh fig 1 is about twice the cultivated area table 1 indicating that on average the cropping intensity is about 200 in uttar pradesh the cropping intensity is about 160 in west bengal it is about 140 and in bihar it is about 110 3 methods 3 1 groundwater balance the groundwater balance in three different sub regions of the egp fig 1 was analysed to evaluate the status quo of groundwater development the three sub regions considered are the terai plains of nepal parts of the egp within india uttar pradesh bihar and west bengal and northwest bangladesh the country boundaries were chosen for demarcating the sub regions primarily because of the available data pertained to the respective countries however the status quo of groundwater development also differed considerably across these sub regions numerical groundwater models were used for analysing groundwater balance for the indian and northwest bangladesh sub regions estimates of major recharge and discharge components were collated from the groundwater resources development board s recent study to analyse groundwater balance of the terai plains 3 1 1 groundwater in the terai plains of nepal estimates of recharge from several sources were used by the groundwater resource development board gwrdb 2019 of nepal to estimate the dynamic groundwater reserve of the terai plains similarly estimates of the groundwater use for irrigation and industrial and domestic uses were also quantified from different sources these estimates were used to interpret the status of groundwater development given the lack of consistent data sets across the terai plains and limited development of groundwater water balance estimation using numerical modelling was not warranted for this sub region 3 1 2 numerical modelling of groundwater balance for the indian and northwest bangladesh sub regions unlike the terai plains groundwater has been extensively developed in the indian and northwest bangladesh sub regions of the egp we used a regional scale numerical groundwater model of the ganges basin alluvial aquifer single layer built and calibrated by janardhanan et al 2020 to compute groundwater balance and groundwater level trends in the indian sub region the regional scale model represented the alluvial aquifer system of the ganges basin in a single layer numerical groundwater model built by using the modflow code the model area is discretised into finite difference cells in 322 rows and 665 columns each cell is 2500 m wide and 2500 m long in the x y directions vertically the aquifer is represented in a single layer that extends from the ground surface to 500 m below the ground surface a similar single layer modflow model janardhanan et al 2021 was used for the northwest bangladesh this sub region was discretised into 1 5 km cells using 210 rows and 122 columns in the model grid the representations of major water balance components such as recharge groundwater use for consumptive demand irrigation and crop water use surface water groundwater sw gw interaction and hydraulic characteristics in both the models are described below 3 1 2 1 recharge groundwater recharge was estimated for the indian sub region as a fraction of rainfall with the fraction determined by calibration in the northwest bangladesh sub region where deep drainage estimates were available from water balance modelling recharge was estimated as a fraction of deep drainage with the fraction determined during model calibration for the indian sub region topography slopes from the northwest to the southeast and rainfall distribution also in general increases from the west to the east hence recharge zones were identified based on these spatial characteristics districts were identified as recharge zones in the northwest bangladesh sub region model as topography remains largely flat across this sub region recharge parameters for each zone were estimated during model calibration 3 1 2 2 evapotranspiration one of the major mechanisms of groundwater discharge in the ganges basin is via evapotranspiration which comprises root water uptake by the native vegetation as well as groundwater use by irrigated agriculture the spatially and temporally variable groundwater contribution to evapotranspiration and consumptive demand was modelled as a fraction of the estimated total evapotranspiration and estimated by constraining the model to observed groundwater levels in the indian region of egp groundwater use for irrigation is largely unmetered and hence a reliable estimate of groundwater use for irrigation is not available past studies cgwb 2019 maheswaran et al 2016 have provided estimates of groundwater pumping due to varying irrigation efficiencies in the region there is a likelihood that a considerable portion of pumped water is returned to the water table as irrigation excess on the other hand farm scale studies conducted in several areas indicate that several crops are under irrigated in many parts of the region singh et al 2019 urfels et al 2020 thus extrapolation of limited number of pumping estimates to quantify groundwater use over the region will result in large uncertainties and lead to significant over or under estimation of groundwater use in regional models hence groundwater pumping was not directly simulated in the model instead representation of the evapotranspiration in both of the models included simulation of groundwater extraction by setting a deeper et extinction depth 3 1 2 3 surface water groundwater interaction modflow river package was used to represent surface water groundwater sw gw interaction as head dependent flux boundary condition in both models the recharge and discharge from and to the river stretches were dynamically simulated in the model using the river package 3 1 2 4 hydraulic characteristics the uncertainty in the regional variability of aquifer hydraulic characteristics such as hydraulic conductivity and specific yield was characterised by representing them as spatially variable parameters in both models the spatial parameterisation device called pilot points was used for this the pilot points of hydraulic conductivity and specific yield were included as parameters for model calibration the parameter values for each model cell were interpolated from the pilot point values this approach enabled calibrating and estimating the hydraulic properties around each pilot point by history matching to the observed groundwater levels in the vicinity 3 1 2 5 groundwater balance the calibrated groundwater models were used to analyse the long term 2001 2012 in the indian sub region and 1985 2015 in northwest bangladesh annual groundwater balance in the regional aquifers the water balance comprises major recharge and discharge components including diffuse recharge from rainfall recharge from and discharge to the rivers and consumptive groundwater use for evapotranspiration the trends in groundwater levels in the indian and northwest bangladesh sub regions were also simulated using the calibrated models 3 2 district surface water balance supply and demand to estimate the district water balances we used the surface water balance approach of ahmad 2002 and ahmad et al 2005 latter modified by ahmad et al 2020a 2020b 2021 ahmad 2002 and ahmad et al 2005 suggested that the net groundwater use in an irrigation area ingw could be computed as the deficit implied by a water balance of the land surface and given by 1 i n g w e t a p n i c w d w d t where eta is the water lost by evapotranspiration of crops and other vegetation pn is the water gained from precipitation considered as a net term after losses to runoff icw is the diversion of water into the area via canals and dw dt is the change in water stored in the area in the soil but also in other surface storages over the period being considered the advantage of the surface water balance approach is that it does not require detailed groundwater modelling or assessment and does not require information or assumptions about lateral groundwater flows ahmad et al 2005 applied the method to the rechna doab region of pakistan using spatially explicit estimates of eta derived from remotely sensed satellite data ahmad et al latter 2020a 2020b 2021 modified the idea slightly to look at a lumped surface water balance of the canal commands in pakistan given by 2 0 e t a p i c w i n g w b where p is the total rainfall and b is a balance term which is the difference between the sum of the other terms and thus forces equation 2 to sum to zero in modifying equation 1 to derive equation 2 the unknown soil water storage term dw dt is absent but implicit in the difference or balance term b we deal here with annual water balances and the change in the annual soil water storage is likely to be insignificant over the long term here we do not have access at this stage of study to time series estimates of the actual evapotranspiration or canal deliveries of irrigation water we therefore modified the approach and the equation to 3 0 p i n g w e t o b where eto is the potential evapotranspiration we have reversed the signs of the terms from equation 2 because as discussed later the meaning of trends in the balance term b becomes more intuitive a positive trend in b with the sign convention of equation 3 is an indication of a trend to a more sustainable water balance which we think intuitively as a positive outcome equation 3 is not strictly a water balance because the potential evapotranspiration is not strictly the actual amount of water that is lost by evapotranspiration however the equation can be viewed as an indicative of the balance between supply rainfall plus groundwater use and demand potential evapotranspiration where supply is in excess of demand there is likely to be runoff and modest need for irrigation where supply is less than demand there is likely to be little runoff and irrigation would lead to greater crop production in the wetter locations within the three sub regions in this study the actual evapotranspiration is likely to be only a little less than the potential evapotranspiration in two locations in the northwest bangladesh the actual evapotranspiration described in results is 88 and 93 of the potential evapotranspiration therefore in the wetter locations results based on equation 3 may be close to the actual water balance leaving the canal water term out of equation 3 is unlikely to be a concern in several of the locations in this study since there is probably little use of canal water our previous work has identified that 97 of irrigation water in northwest bangladesh is sourced from groundwater mainuddin et al 2014 2019a in other areas where supply is less than demand it is possible that the deficit is made up by canal water diverted from the rivers following ahmad et al 2020a 2020b 2021 we calculated the net groundwater use term as the annual change in groundwater levels assessed from a regression through all the groundwater data in a district done separately for pre monsoon and monsoon data for this study in which annual water balances are used we used the average of the pre monsoon and monsoon trends if the groundwater recharge and discharge are strictly one dimensional the calculation of net groundwater use as the annual change in groundwater levels is correct though the estimates may nevertheless be subject to measurement error it is probable that most recharge of the groundwater occurs through rainfall in the northern parts of the egp and so is largely one dimensional this may not be true in the districts near the ganges where subsurface lateral groundwater flow may allow drainage into or recharge from the river any subsurface lateral flows in the groundwater appear as an unaccounted loss or gain in the difference or balance term b equation 3 the balance term is a composite term that includes unaccounted losses and gains such as surface runoff or lateral subsurface flows that contribute to the change in groundwater levels and are thus implicit in the net groundwater use term the difference between actual evapotranspiration and potential evapotranspiration and observation errors in the other terms in calculating the balance term we assumed that the groundwater trend from 1996 in the indian states can be extrapolated back to 1980 the water balance was estimated for the districts fig 1 as an annual time series from 1996 to 2018 indian districts or 1985 to 2016 bangladeshi districts we considered 7 districts lakhimpur kheri kanpur in uttar pradesh purba champara bhojpur and madhubani in bihar and cooch behar and south 24 parganas in west bengal in the indian sub region and 2 districts kurigram and rajshahi in northwest bangladesh representing the different agro climatic conditions of the egp 3 2 1 data as noted in fig 2 data on crop area was obtained as follows indian states from https data gov in catalog district wise season wise crop production statistics bangladesh compiled from various sources and published in a summary form by peña arancibia et al 2020 the data have been cleaned to remove obvious gross errors bihar has some obvious missing data in the first few years fig 2 rainfall and potential evapotranspiration data were taken from the cru ts4 03 dataset available at https crudata uea ac uk cru data hrg cru ts 4 03 and described by harris et al 2014 note that the harris et al s paper strictly refers to an earlier version of the cru dataset the dataset has rainfall and potential evapotranspiration from 1900 to 2018 gridded at 0 5 intervals across the land surfaces of the globe the nearest grid point to the centre of each district was selected and the data from 1980 to 2018 was extracted for use groundwater data were obtained as follows indian states from the central groundwater board at http cgwb gov in gw data access html by clicking on ground water data download and then selecting the state and district of interest bangladesh compiled from bangladesh water development board bwdb data borehole records were screened and the data were cleaned to remove errors surfaces were fitted to the groundwater level data for each period and the average depth to the surface was calculated regressions were fitted to all the pre monsoon and monsoon data points for all districts we converted a change in the groundwater level to an equivalent change in the depth of water stored by multiplying by an assumed specific yield of 0 1 10 3 3 field scale water balance apsim crop modelling apsim the agricultural production systems simulator holzworth et al 2014 is a modelling platform for simulation of biophysical processes in cropping systems particularly those relating to the production and ecological outcomes of management practices in the face of climate risk the model has been extensively tested in diverse environments and management practices in asia with good performance demonstrated amarasingha et al 2017 gaydon et al 2017 hochman et al 2017 kabir et al 2018 laing et al 2018 in apsim the method for modelling conventional tillage ct is quite distinct from conservation agriculture ca and good differentiation between simulating the performance of each has been recently demonstrated for the egp dutta et al 2020 chaki et al 2022 the water balance and all component terms rainfall irrigation change in soil water storage runoff drainage soil evaporation crop transpiration are calculated by apsim on a daily basis based on inputs of daily climate data maximum and minimum temperatures rainfall solar radiation as well as imposed farmers management details of agronomy sowing dates crops irrigation amounts fertiliser tillage etc apsim is a dynamic daily time step model combining management and biophysical modules through a central engine to simulate cropping system performance the model simulates soil water carbon c nitrogen n and phosphorus p dynamics and their interactions in a cropping system s context potential production for a range of crops is determined using stage related radiation use efficiency rue constrained by climate and available leaf area on a daily basis this is then limited to actual biomass production by factors representing soil water n and p limitations keating et al 2003 the apsim soilwat module water balance used in this study employs a multi layer cascading philosophy following ceres jones and kiniry 1986 apsim surfaceom simulates the dynamics of above ground crop residues that are either removed from the system incorporated into the soil or left to decompose on the soil surface transformations of c and n in the soil are simulated by the apsim soiln module processes simulated as part of these transformations include n immobilization urea hydrolysis organic matter decomposition ammonification nitrification and denitrification information from apsim soilwat and apsim soiln regarding soil water and n availability are sought by apsim crop modules for limitation of crop growth on a daily basis apsim pond simulates biogeochemical processes that occur in ponded rice fields gaydon et al 2012b crop modules specifically relevant to this analysis are apsim oryza gaydon et al 2012a apsim wheat wang et al 2003 and apsim maize carberry and abrecht 1991 to simulate ca in the egp general rules followed in specifying the different practices are provided in table 2 when soils are puddled prior to the rice phase then later tilled prior to the wheat maize phase in conventional rice wheat rice maize and similar systems significant inter seasonal changes occur in soil properties gathala et al 2011 puddling reduces the effective saturated hydraulic conductivity ks and bulk density bd of the puddled soil layers whereas tillage after the rice phase increases effective ks by breaking the plow pan but reduces bd of surface soil layers these are significant input parameters in sensibly simulating rice wheat system performance gaydon et al 2012a however apsim does not currently simulate changes in these parameters in response to specified tillage events for the relevant simulated datasets in this study we found it was necessary to employ apsim manager to specify an increase in ks of the plow pan layer by 100 a doubling and a decrease in bangladesh by 5 following post rice tillage and apply the reverse change to these parameters upon puddling at the start of the subsequent rice phase following findings of gathala et al 2011 bund height apsim resettable parameter max pond was also reset to zero via apsim manager on the date of rice field drainage representing opening of the bunds and then again set to the actual experimental bund height on the occasion of pre crop bund establishment once again these are not simulated in apsim rather specified by the user apsim does however simulate the effect of tillage on soil roughness and therefore runoff and water retained on the soil surface and available for infiltration by automatically reducing the usda curve number as per specified parameters as an example we found it necessary to reduce the curve number by 10 in the case of each discing and by 5 for harrowing the curve number was reset to the default value when at least 40 mm of water was added to soil by rain or irrigation to simulate the collapse smoothing of a freshly cultivated soil surface as a result of saturation and rainfall impact balwinder singh et al 2015 we considered four sites for apsim modelling tarahara in the sunsari distract in nepal terai dogachi in purnea district of bihar and falimari in cooch behar district of west bengal in india and premtoli in rajshahi district of bangladesh fig 1 the apsim model for all sites was robustly calibrated and validated https www aciar gov au project cse 2011 077 in this water balance study we compared the performance of ca versus ct at the four sites focusing particularly on water balance terms we also compared awd irrigation and conventional irrigation for boro rice at one site premtoli at rajshahi in bangladesh the simulation was carried out for the period of 2000 2017 4 results 4 1 groundwater balance a wide range of recharge volumes between 5800 mcm and 10 745 mcm were estimated for the terai plains in nepal shreshta et al 2018 duba 1982 underpinned by these studies the dynamic groundwater reserve of the terai plains was estimated as 8800 mcm a total of 756 mcm is currently abstracted for irrigation and industrial purposes and 297 mcm for drinking water use gwrdb 2019 this implies that only 12 of the annually available groundwater resource is currently used accordingly there is a groundwater surplus of 7747 mcm which may be potentially developed based on these estimates there is a significant opportunity for groundwater development for irrigation in the terai plains however it is noteworthy that large scale development of groundwater would result in a state of groundwater balance that is different from the pre development state in the long term the plausible state of groundwater balance should be assessed for the changes in groundwater levels and other impacts to determine the sustainability groundwater is extensively developed for irrigation in the indian and northwest bangladesh sub regions of the egp calibrated groundwater models were used for simulating groundwater balance and groundwater level trends for these sub regions hydraulic properties and parameters governing recharge groundwater contribution to evapotranspiration and surface water groundwater interaction were adjusted during model calibration the simulated groundwater balances for the two corresponding sub regions are shown in fig 3 and fig 4 it is noteworthy that the estimated long term average groundwater use comprising groundwater pumping and groundwater contribution to evapotranspiration is very close to and slightly over the recharge respectively in the indian fig 3d and northwest sub regions fig 4 fig 3a c shows the modelled water balance for the three major states in the indian sub region uttar pradesh bihar and west bengal respectively the estimated recharge from rainfall varies between 232 mm and 389 mm in these states the inflow into groundwater from rivers and lateral fluxes also vary considerably across this sub region the sum of the major inflow components is balanced by the total groundwater use and other discharge components groundwater storage in the basin is in a dynamic equilibrium but there is a small declining trend for the long term average storage change in the individual states and across the basin trends in observed groundwater levels and simulated values from the calibrated groundwater model for selected bores in northwest bangladesh is shown in fig 5 declining groundwater level trend is evident for some of the bores while others have more or less steady groundwater levels all these potentially indicate that groundwater extraction has a significant influence on the current state of groundwater balance further extraction in areas where potential maximum recharge induced by groundwater extraction has already been achieved may result in groundwater mining in other areas further development may be possible however regionally there is a small rate of decline in storage estimated for both the sub regions indicating that groundwater use is unsustainable at least in some areas within the sub regions this is also indicated in the trends in observed and simulated groundwater levels in many bores in both sub regions fig 5 for northwest bangladesh and fig s1 in supplementary materials for indian sub region in fig s1 the first row a gives examples of bores that have observed declining trends in water level the second row b and third row c respectively show bores which have increasing and steady water levels groundwater balance in the indian and northwest bangladesh sub regions are similar with similar rates of recharge and groundwater use locally there could be significant variability that was not explored in this study but regionally annual groundwater use is largely in equilibrium with recharge 4 2 district surface water balance supply and demand the district water balances as an annual average from 1985 to 2015 bangladesh and 1996 to 2018 india are shown in fig 6 this figure shows that the annual average rainfall increases and the demand potential evapotranspiration decreases from the west to the east of the egp see fig s2 in supplementary materials for temporal trends for each district the annual supply of groundwater to the surface or return flow from the surface to groundwater is too small to see at the scale of the top plot in fig 6 and is presented at a 100 times greater scale in the bottom plot note that a falling groundwater table results at least partly from groundwater used in irrigation which is an inflow to the surface water balance rajshahi district in the northwest bangladesh has the largest declining water table amongst the districts assessed indicating that it has the largest contribution to the surface water supply from groundwater although small in annual terms a decline of 21 mm per year of equivalent water depth amounts to about 200 mm decline in the water table per year with an assumed specific yield of 0 1 or about 6 m over the period from 1985 to 2015 fig 6 also shows the difference between supply mainly rainfall and demand mainly potential evapotranspiration as the balance term varying from large negative in the west to large positive in the east this indicates that in the east there is a large annual surplus of water which leaves the districts as an outflow in the form of runoff in the west on the other hand there is a deficit of supply to satisfy demand and hence there is a large potential for irrigation if supply can be increased 4 3 field scale water balance the apsim modelling results are summarised in figs 7 and 8 detailed results of different sites are provided in supplementary information figs s3 s6 in supplementary materials however the same trends were evident at all sites regardless of climate and soil characteristics the crop transpiration ep is generally higher in conservation agriculture ca systems driven by increased rabi crop production under ca this is likely due to better soil structure without puddling that enhanced crop rooting and nutrition during rabi season crops gathala et al 2011 soil evaporation es is similar in ca and ct systems but less in ca crops due to increased surface residue cover this difference could be greater where a greater percentage of residues are retained in egp ca systems however the trade off between crop benefits and livestock feed appears to result in only around 25 residues retained in this region net evapotranspiration the key variable in determining water losses in these systems is therefore very similar in ca and ct practices but generally greater under ca across our simulations of site and cropping system fig 7 drainage below the root zone is greater in ca but runoff is less irrigation inputs were greater across the ca treatments driven largely by increased water percolation drainage below the crop root zone during rice cultivation these results from the increased saturated percolation rates in soils under ca practice through cessation of the puddling process the maintenance of more crop residues on the surface in ca compared to ct was not sufficient to reduce soil evaporation enough to reduce overall evapotranspiration this is applied on average and also for each individual sites and crop rotation the key message from this field scale analysis across four diverse locations and environments in the egp is that evapotranspiration is not reduced by the implementation of ca practices if anything evapotranspiration is slightly increased fig 7 right side figures awd had little effect on soil evaporation in boro rice however it did reduce drainage percolation below crop root zone and therefore irrigation requirement fig 8 this is due largely to reduced hydraulic head under awd irrigation bouman et al 2007 crop transpiration ep is determined by how productive the rice crop is and hence how much it transpires when done properly awd has minimal impact on crop production and therefore ep differences are marginal compared with conventional fully ponded rice irrigation our simulations reflect that ca boro rice is more productive than ct boro rice leading to greater ep and hence greater evapotranspiration however the practice of awd itself has little impact on evapotranspiration during boro rice season fig 8 right hand side 5 discussion the global increase in food production has exerted tremendous pressure on production linked resources like water and soil and specifically on groundwater resources the accelerating stress on groundwater in the egp has raised concerns on the sustainability of agricultural production systems this challenge is being faced both locally and regionally mojid and mainuddin 2021 several direct approaches like water saving irrigation groundwater by laws rain fed cropping groundwater recharge enhancement rainwater harvesting and virtual water import and indirect approaches like energy pricing and regulation are available and often promoted to reduce regional water use aeschbach hertig and gleeson 2012 fao 2016 however the over arching consideration from the literature and from the results presented in this paper is that climate agriculture and groundwater development vary considerably across the egp and indeed across the indo gangetic basin more widely analysis of the trends of groundwater level and groundwater balance separately for three different sub regions terai plains of nepal parts of the egp within india and northwest bangladesh of the egp based on the geography and political boundaries clearly reveals this variation the results reveal that the state of groundwater exploitation and use differs considerably across the region the long term average storage changes in regions indicate small rates of groundwater depletion this potentially indicates the stress on the regional groundwater system induced by the combination of large scale irrigation water use and other factors like changes in rainfall patterns induced by climate change and cropping patterns considerable differences are seen between the components of individual water balances however these individual water balance components like the river recharge and evapotranspiration fluxes are not independently constrained by relevant observations other than the available groundwater levels more comprehensive probabilistic approaches to the water balance are needed before conclusive inferences can be made about these individual water balance components nevertheless the dynamic equilibrium in the groundwater storage estimated for both the indian and northwest bangladesh sub regions indicates that groundwater use may be at the sustainable maximum rate or slightly over that in at least parts of these regions while increased groundwater use may be possible in other areas like the terai plains of nepal thus any policy that prescribes uniform water saving measures across the region may not be as effective as it is perceived adaptive approaches e g van der voorn et al 2012 2017 thomann et al 2020 considering uncertainties regarding climate change e g van der voorn et al 2012 miro et al 2021 will be required to achieve sustainable use without affecting the food security of the region water balance analysis reveals that extensive use of groundwater intensive crops like boro rice can potentially contribute to declining groundwater levels in some areas in the region like the barind tract of northwest bangladesh in this region groundwater recharge is constrained by the soil type and other hydrogeological characteristics even here however it appears that groundwater development may not be the sole cause of groundwater decline peña arancibia et al 2020 see also asoka et al 2017 for north central india water balance analysis at smaller spatial scales at district scale which is smaller than regional and subregional scales also shows that the annual supply of water from rainfall exceeds the potential demand in the north and east of the region around cooch behar and the northern part of northwest bangladesh exemplified by the kurigram district the district scale water balance shows that although the annual supply in these areas exceeds potential evapotranspiration there are nevertheless periods in the dry season when there is a deficit so irrigation is useful at critical times of crop growth however the overall demand for irrigation water will be modest and the excess of water supply over demand in the wet season is likely to replenish drawdown of aquifers hence there is limited scope in the northeast for impact on irrigation water volumes from reducing water consumption as evapotranspiration or from changing the source of irrigation water as the excess of annual supply over potential evapotranspiration diminishes towards south and west the dry season deficit grows and its duration lengthens thus requiring more irrigation water for crop growth this is the situation in the rajshahi area in the northwest bangladesh sub region where irrigation is associated with groundwater level decline in such areas of the egp and also in many other similar parts of the world resource conservation technologies like ca and awd are often adopted as a response to the concerns of agricultural sustainability under water deficit conditions dumanski et al 2006 fao 2018 islam et al 2019 in those areas reduction in water consumption as evapotranspiration through water savings measures would lessen the requirement for pumping and might arrest or reverse declining groundwater tables however since other factors may be partly responsible for the declining groundwater levels peña arancibia et al 2020 water saving measures alone may not necessarily achieve sustainable groundwater use several benefits of the resource conservation technologies such as reduced labour energy and nutrient use as well as reduced agrochemical leaching are scale invariant and instinctively clear pokharel et al 2018 mujeeb ur rehman et al 2011 however achieving water savings with these technologies remains uncertain at the system level since it is both a temporal and spatial scale dependent component and associated with the regional hydrologic cycle li et al 2017 perry et al 2017 a resource conservation technology which saves water by reducing percolation rates represents only a narrow local perspective of water application mojid and mainuddin 2021 and does not account for return flows to groundwater from the irrigated field resource conservation technologies can alter crop water use and consequently the regional water cycle liu et al 2016 with adverse impact on groundwater dynamics zhang et al 2014 they reduce water application in the fields with a consequent reduced lower percolation and groundwater recharge the return flow may constitute significant part of groundwater recharge ahmad et al 2002 giordano 2009 keller et al 1996 tuong et al 2005 therefore whether the reduced extraction of groundwater associated with reduced recharge increases groundwater storage or reduces it remains uncertain moa fao 2013 it is likely that large scale adoption of these technologies can lead to major decline in groundwater levels tabbal et al 2002 mays 2013 grogan et al 2017 the conclusions of rushton et al 2020 suggest that saving water by preventing deep drainage might be counter productive and possibly lead to more rapidly declining groundwater levels further west in bhojpur lakhimpur kheri and kanpur all of which have large deficits of rain to satisfy potential demand and therefore more requirement for irrigation water there is increasing scope for impact on regional hydrology of reducing water consumption as evapotranspiration or from changing the source of irrigation water finally south 24 parganas within the indian sub region in west bengal especially in locations close to the coast is a special case a key aspect of management for crop production is the management of salt mainuddin et al 2019a b 2020b 2021 remesan et al 2021 irrigation is done using fresh or less saline surface water stored in canals ponds or rivers here water saving measures are important because water of sufficient freshness becomes scarce in the later part of the dry season water saving through mulching and other techniques may be important paul et al 2020 here preventing deep drainage through less pumping or alternate wetting and drying offers real water savings as the underlying groundwater is saline even though it may not reduce evapotranspiration the impact of the resource conservation measures on regional hydrology has less to do with water quantity than water quality the apsim modelling results described in the paper reveal that at several representative sites across the egp region conservation agriculture ca and water saving techniques have some effects on the hydrology and water balance components but do not significantly affect the evapotranspiration these observations are consistent with the findings in literature as evidenced in a recent extensive review by mojid and mainuddin 2021 water saving technologies are promoted based on the assumption that a reduction in water inputs per unit of output provides an equivalent water saving however this assumption depends on the destination of the saved water and a saving of water may not always be realised a large part of the applied irrigation water percolates to the groundwater and can be reused hence percolation is not necessarily a loss keller et al 1995 apsim defines percolation as water moving vertically downwards beyond the crop root zone the apsim variable called drain in practice this percolation may not necessarily be the same as groundwater recharge as soil water storage below the bottom of crop rooting zone in other words not considered by apsim and the surface of the groundwater may exist not all of apsim s percolation may enter the groundwater this limits apsim s ability to simulate groundwater recharge per se however even though numerical differences may exist the water concerned is still not a loss from the system regardless of whether it is stored in the soil below crop roots or enters the groundwater although any work to improve irrigation efficiency is commendable babajimopoulos et al 2007 focusing on local water use efficiency alone and ignoring return flows is a misapprehension qureshi et al 2011 while there may be benefits in ca such as greater profitability primarily due to reduced costs of labour and other inputs of production dutta et al 2020 gathala et al 2021 chaki et al 2021 it is unlikely to solve regional groundwater problems everywhere similarly while not an essential component of ca awd irrigation practice can reduce groundwater extraction for irrigation and associated pumping costs but has little impact on evapotranspiration and overall groundwater dynamics mainuddin et al 2020a our study indicates that ca reduces erosion and runoff and increases soil moisture holding capacities and organic matter in the surface soil this is supported by several reports in the literature e g palm et al 2014 however our study has additionally shown that the reduced runoff in ca is matched roughly by increased drainage below the crop roots compared with conventional tillage both drainage and runoff waters are likely to ultimately re enter the water tables and aquifers and hence are not system water losses in any case this finding is also supported by keller et al 1995 water saving can only come from net reductions in water consumption as evapotranspiration except in the coastal saline areas such as in south 24 parganas or from changing the source of irrigation water and the destination of unused water similar to the farmer perspective there is likely to be less impact in either of these senses on the regional hydrology in the northeast of the egp e g cooch behar and kurigram than in the west e g kanpur however from a farmer s perspective any reduction in the use of irrigation water is a saving which will reduce costs and enhance profitability provided yields and quality of produce are not affected the trend from an excess of annual supply over demand in the northeast of the egp cooch behar and kurigram to a deficit in the west kanpur means that there is less incentive for the farmer to save water in the northeast conversely there is more to be gained from water saving measures in the west the interactions between non agricultural and agricultural water usages also vary across the spatial scales and influence water saving khan et al 2002 at large spatial scale e g basin scale reducing water use in irrigation and transferring the saved water to higher valued usages is the preferred goal this approach does not consider individual water use but evaluates return flows and approximates water use efficiencies at field and basin scales while accounting for water and analysing water use efficiencies frederiksen and perry 1995 keller et al 1995 simons et al 2020 so a clear understanding of the scale effects of water use is crucial to increase water savings loeve et al 2002 molden 1997 garrick et al 2012 jiang and wang 2019 6 conclusion a water balance analysis at the three different scales regional district and field scales suggests that while there may be some cause effect associations between irrigation water use and groundwater sustainability they cannot be generalized across the entire egp region nor is it likely that future agricultural development and increasing demands of irrigation water will have a uniform impact across the region therefore a pan basin solution like the promotion of conservation agriculture or awd irrigation practice to achieve groundwater sustainability may not be and plausibly will not be suitable across different spatial scales it is therefore important to have a comprehensive understanding of the egp s groundwater resources and their future sustainability by linking farm scale activities with the regional or basin scale the advances in remote sensing technologies and machine learning to understand land use changes and evapotranspiration and in numerical groundwater modelling to understand recharge discharge dynamics can be effectively integrated for developing such comprehensive understanding linking field and basin scale analysis this will provide options for sustainable groundwater

11794,the ecological and environmental issues caused by seawater intrusion economic losses should not be neglected especially from a long term perspective this research presents a new approach to calculate the water footprint of the crops that irrigated by coastal groundwater aquifers considering seawater intrusion is one of the effecting pollutants seawater intrusion footprint swif is a new term of water footprint that defines aquifer pollution due to the excessive withdrawal from the aquifer the seawater intrusion footprint that defined as the amount of water needed to mitigate the impact of seawater intrusion is different from the grey water footprint which is defined as the amount of water needed to mitigate the impact of pollutants generated during the life cycle of a product using the new approach the water footprint of 12 irrigated crops in the nile delta in egypt that use the coastal groundwater was recalculated and compared with the currently published figures that do not consider the pollution caused by seawater intrusion the main results are the irrigation using only coastal groundwater the total water footprint of some crops such as wheat bananas sugar cane and apples increase by more than 80 of published figures for each crop to reach 3068 1079 345 and 1761 m3 ton respectively while using coastal groundwater with green water in rainy seasons the total water footprint of the same crops increases to 2282 1038 300 and 1617 m3 ton respectively since seawater intrusion causes groundwater contamination and salinization leading to decreases in agricultural production and ecological and environmental issues so the economic losses arising from seawater intrusion impacts should not be neglected especially from a long term perspective also it is recommended to incorporate seawater intrusion footprint swif in the total water footprint for the crops that irrigated by coastal groundwater aquifer also the study suggested applying the new approach whenever the coastal groundwater has been used near the coast or far away if there is a seawater intrusion graphical abstract image 1 keywords seawater intrusion water footprint groundwater coastal aquifer 1 introduction over the last decade the world population increase followed by food production and water consumption has an intense pressure on water and energy resources moreover population and economic growth levels will pressure freshwater demands over decades in the meantime water contamination and water quality degradation have become critical issues for many regions worldwide especially in urban areas where people continue to pressure local water resource systems due to food production and economic growth laspidou et al 2012 in coastal areas about 37 of the world s population lives where the population density is about twice the global average moreover two thirds of the world s cities are located in coastal zones worldwide growing coastal areas population and agricultural expansion are causing a rapid increase in the water demands although groundwater is the primary water source in coastal areas a global review of coastal groundwater salinity was conducted by the international groundwater resources assessment center in 2009 reported that 103 coastal groundwater bodies showed seawater intrusion van weert et al 2009 van weert 2012 the climate change impacts such as decreased precipitation and sea level rise could amplify the salinization of coastal aquifers moreover anthropogenic activities such as excessive abstraction of groundwater could lead to a negative impact on fresh coastal groundwater coastal aquifers provide essential quantities of fresh water and their overuse affects the quality dropdown in piezometric levels and seawater intrusion the seawater intrusion of coastal aquifers is a significant hydrogeological risk affecting coastal regions which are often densely populated and highly dependent on groundwater niazi 2002 since seawater intrusion causes groundwater contamination and salinization leading to decreases in agricultural production in addition to the ecological and environmental issues caused by seawater intrusion economic losses should not be neglected especially from a long term perspective williams 2010 an expressive example of this matter is the coastal areas in north africa which is considered one of the most critical water sources that depend on it for most population activities and food production therefore re assessing the water footprint of the products in this area is very important where excess withdrawal from these coastal aquifers causes seawater intrusion which causes an increase in the salinity of the groundwater aquifers and the environmental challenges fig 1 the water footprint is a recent tool to map the impact of global water resources consumption it is the volume of freshwater used to produce crops goods or services the water footprint is classified as green blue and grey a green water footprint quantifies the volume of precipitation stored as soil moisture and a blue water footprint is the volume of freshwater consumed along the supply chain while greywater footprint measures the volume of water required to assimilate pollutants and it is associated with the production chain to meet ambient water quality standards laspidou 2013 the grey water footprint provides a tool to help assess the sustainable efficient and equitable use of water resources whether surface water or groundwater generally groundwater ends up as surface water the challenge is determining the grey water footprint for surface and groundwater systems and when pollutant loads arrive in the groundwater system when it reaches the surface water system so two components of the grey water footprint must be calculated the grey footprint for surface water and the grey footprint for groundwater franke et al 2013 the previous definition of the grey water footprint is concerned with calculating the amount of water needed to mitigate the impact of pollution caused by any crop commodity or service therefore it was necessary to review the previous studies and ensure they did not consider groundwater pollution due to seawater intrusion while calculating the grey water footprint previous studies focus on nitrogen and how increasing nitrogen n application rates results in n leaching and crop yield valero et al 2005 berenguer et al 2009 rong and xuefeng 2011 zhou et al 2011 good and beatty 2011 huang et al 2017 considered the effect of manure versus inorganic n fertilizer application on nitrate leaching while yu et al 2016 explored the impact of different combinations of tillage practice and n fertilizer form on crop yield huang et al 2015 analyzed the impact of other tillage practices and n application rates on yield and n leaching moreover there are quite a few studies on the relationship between rates of irrigation and n application and crop yield rimski korsakov et al 2009 yin et al 2014 when applying grey water footprint to crops the estimation of greywater requires knowing the following fertilizer application rate fertilizer leaching fraction crop yield maximum allowed pollutant concentration in the ambient natural waters and locations that do not enable pollution however in coastal groundwater aquifers there is indirect pollution due to over abstraction of groundwater which causes changes in the hydrogeological balance between seawater and groundwater levels due to seawater intrusion in the groundwater aquifers which causes groundwater salinization this pollutant type was not addressed previously in the critical load approach when calculating the grey water footprint of crops products and commodities that use coastal groundwater aquifers as a water source the choice of pollutants related to grey water footprint calculation for irrigated crops is essential although most previous studies focus on nitrogen other pollutants could be equally crucial such as pesticides herbicides atrazine and organics usually related to industrial crop processing plants and thermal pollution in addition to the pollutants mentioned above there is aquifer pollution due to seawater intrusion which has not studied yet therefore there is a need to estimate the water footprint of the pollution caused by seawater intrusion effective management of resources and environmental systems have been of concerns in the past decades since contamination and resource scarcity problems have led to a variety of impacts and liabilities moreover a variety of processes and activities are interrelated to each other resulting in complicated systems with interactive dynamic nonlinear multi objective multistage multilayer and uncertain features these complexities may be further amplified due to their association with economic consequences if the promises of expected targets are violated mathematical tools are recognized as effective tools that examine environmental and ecological impacts of alternative pollution control and resources conservation actions de paola et al 2021 chakraborty et al 2021 petrosino et al 2021 coppola et al 2021 petrosino et al 2019 loutatidou et al 2017 therefore to facilitate more robust management and planning of resources and environmental systems innovative mathematical tools are able to reflect various combinations of these complexities are desired this research presents a new approach used for the first time to calculate the water footprint of irrigated crops that use coastal groundwater aquifers as a water source considering seawater intrusion is one of the effecting pollutants seawater intrusion footprint swif is launched as a new term for a type of water footprint that defines aquifer pollution due to the excessive groundwater withdrawal from the coastal aquifer this new term differentiates between the water footprint of coastal groundwater pollution caused by seawater intrusion and the grey water footprint which is defined as the amount of water needed to dilute the effect of generated pollutants during the life cycle of any product in this case the new definition of the seawater intrusion footprint is the amount of water necessary to mitigate the pollution impact of the groundwater aquifer due to seawater intrusion using the new approach the water footprint of 12 irrigated crops in the nile delta in egypt that use the coastal groundwater will be re estimated and compared with the current calculations that do not consider the pollution caused by seawater intrusion 2 material and methods 2 1 seawater intrusion mechanism due to the altitude difference freshwater always flows seaward simultaneously the higher pressure and density cause seawater to flow landward both continuous movements keep the system at a dynamic state equilibrium especially in the transition zone where seawater mixes with freshwater chemically the significant difference between freshwater and seawater is their salinity the upper limit of the total dissolved solids tds for freshwater is often taken as 1000 mg tds l other salinity classes that are typically distinguished are brackish saline and hypersaline which have a tds value higher than ocean water salinity average ocean water has 36 000 mg tds l post et al 2018 where fresh groundwater and intruded seawater face in a coastal aquifer a transition zone is formed salinities within this created zone range between freshwater and seawater fig 2 transition zone location and width depend on the groundwater system characteristics if the coastal aquifer is hydraulically connected to the sea intruded seawater forms a wedge that penetrates inland into the aquifer due to the higher density of seawater compared to freshwater a column of seawater exerts more significant pressure than a column of freshwater of the same length because of this seawater can protrude into the aquifer below the land surface inland from the shoreline the fresh groundwater near the coast thus forms a water body that floats on the saline groundwater a first estimate of the thickness of the freshwater lens can be obtained with the formula 1 γ α h where γ is the depth of the lens bottom below sea level h is the elevation of the groundwater table above sea level and the α factor is usually around 40 due to the difference in density between freshwater and standard seawater post et al 2018 the ghyben herzberg analytical solution was the first to address the problem of the saltwater wedge after that many other mathematical solutions were presented

equation 2 z is the depth of the freshwater saltwater interface below the water table m in equation 3 hf is the equivalent freshwater head m in equation 4 x0 is the position of the freshwater

lead to a shallow interface while low k values give a deep interface essaid 1990 since the interface s depth is related to aquifer lithological characteristics 2 2 water footprint calculations the methods of calculating the three water footprint types have been reviewed such as green water footprint blue water footprint and grey water footprint as follows green water footprint this type of water footprint is particularly relevant for forestry and crops where it refers to the total rainwater evapotranspiration from soils and plantations plus the water incorporated into the harvested crop or wood so the green water footprint is equal to 8 w f p r o c g r e e n g r e e n w a t e r e v a p o r a t i o n g r e e n w a t e r i n c o r p o r a t i o n v o l u m e t i m e green water consumption in agriculture can be calculated or estimated with a set of empirical formulas or with a suitable crop model for estimating evapotranspiration based on input data on soil crop and climate characteristics the last component green water incorporation refers to the part of the return flow that is not available for reuse within the same basin and the same withdrawal time arjen et al 2011 blue water footprint the blue water footprint indicates consumptive use of available surface or groundwater in a certain period which does not mean that the water disappears because water will remain within the cycle and always return somewhere so it provides a measure of the amount of available blue water consumed by humans the blue water footprint is equal to 9 w f p r o c b l u e b l u e w a t e r e v a p o r a t i o n b l u e w a t e r i n c o r p o r a t i o n v o l u m e t i m e sometimes especially in our study case if there is shared use of groundwater with surface water so the blue water footprint can be divided into the surface blue water footprint the groundwater blue footprint so the blue water footprint is equal to 10 w f p r o c b l u e b l u e g r o u n d w a t e r e v a p o r a t i o n b l u e s u r f a c e w a t e r e v a p o r a t i o n b l u e w a t e r i n c o r p o r a t i o n v o l u m e t i m e the last component blue water incorporation refers to the part of the return flow that is not available for reuse within the same basin and the same withdrawal time either because it is returned to another basin or returned to the environment at another time arjen et al 2011 grey water footprint mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 presented calculations of the global water footprint of crops production for 1996 to 2005 they found that the share of grey water footprint is around 10 of the total water footprint the grey water footprint is calculated by dividing the pollutant load l in mass time by the difference between the ambient water quality standard for that pollutant cmax in mass volume and its natural concentration of receiving water body cnat in mass volume 11 wf p r o c g r e y l c m a x c n a t v o l u m e t i m e greywater footprint is calculated using ambient water quality standards for the receiving freshwater body because the grey water footprint shows the required ambient water volume to assimilate chemicals and pollutants the ambient water quality standard may vary from one to another water body also the natural concentration may differ from one place to another as a result a specific pollutant load can result in two or more grey water footprints depending on the site estimate the leaching runoff fraction for diffuse pollution sources the amount of chemical that reaches a body of water groundwater or surface water depends on the leaching runoff fraction of the applied chemical this fraction is the percentage of a chemical lost to surface water by runoff or to groundwater by leaching fig 3 the contributions of artificial drainage generally and interior drainage end in surface waters within a relatively short period in most cases the groundwater also reaches the surface waters such as rivers and lakes but the transport time by the land flow is much shorter than the transport through the deep groundwater franke et al 2013 calculating the chemical load in the case of diffuse sources of water pollution is not as straightforward the pollutant load is the fraction of the total amount of applied chemicals on or into the soil and reaches the groundwater or and surface water the number of chemicals used can be measured but the fraction of applied chemicals that reach groundwater or surface water cannot be measured since they diffusely enter the water so it is unclear where and when to measure therefore it is common use a simple model that assumes a certain fixed fraction of the applied chemicals finally reaches the groundwater or surface water franke et al 2013 12 wf p r o c g r e y l c m a x c n a t α x a p p l c m a x c n a t v o l u m e t i m e the dimensionless factor α stands for the leaching runoff fraction defined as the fraction of applied chemicals reaching freshwater bodies the variable appl represents the application of chemicals on or into the soil in a specific process in mass time 2 3 seawater intrusion water footprint swif the massive increase in water demands has greatly intensified groundwater extraction especially in coastal areas famiglietti 2014 however adverse effects occur when there is an excessive groundwater withdrawal faster than the natural recharge rate so groundwater aquifer contaminated by saltwater is considered one of the most common threats in the coastal areas and any groundwater abstraction volume can share in groundwater degradation fig 4 duan 2016 in this study seawater intrusion footprint is a new term that has been launched for the first time for a new type of water footprint that defines the aquifer pollution by seawater intrusion due to the excessive withdrawal from the aquifer this new term differentiates between the water footprint of groundwater pollution caused by seawater intrusion and the grey water footprint that defined as the amount of water needed to dilute the effect of generated pollutants during the life cycle of any crop product or commodity in this case the new definition of the seawater intrusion footprint swif will be the amount of water necessary to mitigate the pollution impact of the groundwater aquifer due to seawater intrusion swif has been estimated on realistic assumptions as follows a first assumption the total water footprint of any irrigated crop in the coastal area will contain one or more of the following components green water footprint blue surface water footprint blue renewable groundwater water footprint blue coastal groundwater water footprint grey water footprint seawater intrusion footprint swif b second assumption the amount of water needed to remove the impact of seawater pollution is the same as the amount of water withdrawn from the coastal groundwater aquifers and used in growing crops or producing any product c the third assumption to apply the new approach it is required that the aquifer is coastal and is affected by the seawater intrusion when groundwater abstraction while this approach cannot be applied to renewable aquifers that are not affected by seawater intrusion based on these assumptions the swif is equal to the blue coastal groundwater footprint for irrigated crops products goods or services 13 wf s e a w a t e r int r u s i o

calculate the water footprint for irrigated crops in the coastal areas the new approach considers the irrigation water source such as coastal groundwater whether renewable or non renewable groundwater green water and surface water fig 5 shows a schematic representation of the new approach components of coastal crops water footprint the figure shows that the return flow is not a part of the water footprint and the water footprint includes blue surface water renewable groundwater coastal aquifer groundwater green water and greywater moreover the indirect water use component on the developed approach the blue water footprint refers to the consumption of blue water resources such as surface water renewable groundwater or coastal groundwater along the supply chain consumption refers to water loss from the available groundwater or surface water body in a catchment area losses occur when water evaporates returns to another basin sea or is incorporated into a product the green water footprint refers to the consumption of green water resources rainwater insofar as it does not become runoff the grey water footprint refers to the volume of freshwater required to assimilate the load of pollutants given natural background concentrations and existing ambient water quality standards seawater intrusion footprint is defined as the volume of fresh water needed to mitigate the effect of seawater intrusion on groundwater aquifer usually equal to the part of coastal groundwater that shares in the product either direct or indirect the water footprint differs from the classical measure of water use in three respects it does not include returned water to where it came from but indirect water is included equation 15 is the general equation which has been developed in this research to calculate the water footprint of irrigated crops in the coastal areas which depends on groundwater from coastal aquifers as a whole or partial source of irrigation 15 wf p r o c wf p r o c g r e e n

information related to the water footprint of 12 crops in the nile delta in egypt from 1995 to 2005 these12 selected crops are irrigated by surface water coastal groundwater and green water in the rainy season making it an ideal case for applying the new approach table 1 shows the water footprint of 12 selected crops 3 1 first scenario coastal groundwater and green water in this scenario the total water footprint for 12 egyptian corps has been re recalculated using the new approach where green water and coastal groundwater are the irrigation water sources fig 6 shows the values of seawater intrusion footprint which equals the blue coastal groundwater footprint and total water footprint for 12 selected crops the main results are apple s seawater intrusion footprint equals 679 m3 ton while its total water footprint equals 1617 m3 ton bananas seawater intrusion footprint equals 470 m3 ton and the total water footprint equals 1038 m3 ton wheat s seawater intrusion footprint equals 470 m3 ton while its total water footprint equals 1038 m3 ton 3 2 second scenario coastal groundwater in this scenario the total water footprint for 12 selected corps has been recalculated using the new approach where the irrigation water source is the coastal groundwater without green water as in fig 7 the green water footprint is zero the blue water footprint was calculated as a summation of the green water footprint and blue water footprint when applying the new approach the seawater intrusion footprint equals the blue coastal groundwater footprint apples seawater intrusion footprint equals 823 m3 ton while the total water footprint for apples equals 1761 m3 ton bananas seawater intrusion footprint equals 511 m3 ton while the total water footprint for bananas equals 1079

egypt with different water resources such as the following green and surface water or and renewable groundwater non coastal aquifer surface water or and renewable groundwater non coastal aquifer green

that occurred and equals the amount of water needed to remove the most significant pollutants arising from the production process it is always a fraction of the blue and or green water footprint however it is not related to the seawater intrusion footprint as the seawater intrusion footprint expresses the amount of water needed to mitigate the effect of the seawater intrusion which is always equal to the blue water footprint of the coastal groundwater since seawater intrusion causes groundwater contamination and salinization leading to decreases in agricultural production and ecological

11794,the ecological and environmental issues caused by seawater intrusion economic losses should not be neglected especially from a long term perspective this research presents a new approach to calculate the water footprint of the crops that irrigated by coastal groundwater aquifers considering seawater intrusion is one of the effecting pollutants seawater intrusion footprint swif is a new term of water footprint that defines aquifer pollution due to the excessive withdrawal from the aquifer the seawater intrusion footprint that defined as the amount of water needed to mitigate the impact of seawater intrusion is different from the grey water footprint which is defined as the amount of water needed to mitigate the impact of pollutants generated during the life cycle of a product using the new approach the water footprint of 12 irrigated crops in the nile delta in egypt that use the coastal groundwater was recalculated and compared with the currently published figures that do not consider the pollution caused by seawater intrusion the main results are the irrigation using only coastal groundwater the total water footprint of some crops such as wheat bananas sugar cane and apples increase by more than 80 of published figures for each crop to reach 3068 1079 345 and 1761 m3 ton respectively while using coastal groundwater with green water in rainy seasons the total water footprint of the same crops increases to 2282 1038 300 and 1617 m3 ton respectively since seawater intrusion causes groundwater contamination and salinization leading to decreases in agricultural production and ecological and environmental issues so the economic losses arising from seawater intrusion impacts should not be neglected especially from a long term perspective also it is recommended to incorporate seawater intrusion footprint swif in the total water footprint for the crops that irrigated by coastal groundwater aquifer also the study suggested applying the new approach whenever the coastal groundwater has been used near the coast or far away if there is a seawater intrusion graphical abstract image 1 keywords seawater intrusion water footprint groundwater coastal aquifer 1 introduction over the last decade the world population increase followed by food production and water consumption has an intense pressure on water and energy resources moreover population and economic growth levels will pressure freshwater demands over decades in the meantime water contamination and water quality degradation have become critical issues for many regions worldwide especially in urban areas where people continue to pressure local water resource systems due to food production and economic growth laspidou et al 2012 in coastal areas about 37 of the world s population lives where the population density is about twice the global average moreover two thirds of the world s cities are located in coastal zones worldwide growing coastal areas population and agricultural expansion are causing a rapid increase in the water demands although groundwater is the primary water source in coastal areas a global review of coastal groundwater salinity was conducted by the international groundwater resources assessment center in 2009 reported that 103 coastal groundwater bodies showed seawater intrusion van weert et al 2009 van weert 2012 the climate change impacts such as decreased precipitation and sea level rise could amplify the salinization of coastal aquifers moreover anthropogenic activities such as excessive abstraction of groundwater could lead to a negative impact on fresh coastal groundwater coastal aquifers provide essential quantities of fresh water and their overuse affects the quality dropdown in piezometric levels and seawater intrusion the seawater intrusion of coastal aquifers is a significant hydrogeological risk affecting coastal regions which are often densely populated and highly dependent on groundwater niazi 2002 since seawater intrusion causes groundwater contamination and salinization leading to decreases in agricultural production in addition to the ecological and environmental issues caused by seawater intrusion economic losses should not be neglected especially from a long term perspective williams 2010 an expressive example of this matter is the coastal areas in north africa which is considered one of the most critical water sources that depend on it for most population activities and food production therefore re assessing the water footprint of the products in this area is very important where excess withdrawal from these coastal aquifers causes seawater intrusion which causes an increase in the salinity of the groundwater aquifers and the environmental challenges fig 1 the water footprint is a recent tool to map the impact of global water resources consumption it is the volume of freshwater used to produce crops goods or services the water footprint is classified as green blue and grey a green water footprint quantifies the volume of precipitation stored as soil moisture and a blue water footprint is the volume of freshwater consumed along the supply chain while greywater footprint measures the volume of water required to assimilate pollutants and it is associated with the production chain to meet ambient water quality standards laspidou 2013 the grey water footprint provides a tool to help assess the sustainable efficient and equitable use of water resources whether surface water or groundwater generally groundwater ends up as surface water the challenge is determining the grey water footprint for surface and groundwater systems and when pollutant loads arrive in the groundwater system when it reaches the surface water system so two components of the grey water footprint must be calculated the grey footprint for surface water and the grey footprint for groundwater franke et al 2013 the previous definition of the grey water footprint is concerned with calculating the amount of water needed to mitigate the impact of pollution caused by any crop commodity or service therefore it was necessary to review the previous studies and ensure they did not consider groundwater pollution due to seawater intrusion while calculating the grey water footprint previous studies focus on nitrogen and how increasing nitrogen n application rates results in n leaching and crop yield valero et al 2005 berenguer et al 2009 rong and xuefeng 2011 zhou et al 2011 good and beatty 2011 huang et al 2017 considered the effect of manure versus inorganic n fertilizer application on nitrate leaching while yu et al 2016 explored the impact of different combinations of tillage practice and n fertilizer form on crop yield huang et al 2015 analyzed the impact of other tillage practices and n application rates on yield and n leaching moreover there are quite a few studies on the relationship between rates of irrigation and n application and crop yield rimski korsakov et al 2009 yin et al 2014 when applying grey water footprint to crops the estimation of greywater requires knowing the following fertilizer application rate fertilizer leaching fraction crop yield maximum allowed pollutant concentration in the ambient natural waters and locations that do not enable pollution however in coastal groundwater aquifers there is indirect pollution due to over abstraction of groundwater which causes changes in the hydrogeological balance between seawater and groundwater levels due to seawater intrusion in the groundwater aquifers which causes groundwater salinization this pollutant type was not addressed previously in the critical load approach when calculating the grey water footprint of crops products and commodities that use coastal groundwater aquifers as a water source the choice of pollutants related to grey water footprint calculation for irrigated crops is essential although most previous studies focus on nitrogen other pollutants could be equally crucial such as pesticides herbicides atrazine and organics usually related to industrial crop processing plants and thermal pollution in addition to the pollutants mentioned above there is aquifer pollution due to seawater intrusion which has not studied yet therefore there is a need to estimate the water footprint of the pollution caused by seawater intrusion effective management of resources and environmental systems have been of concerns in the past decades since contamination and resource scarcity problems have led to a variety of impacts and liabilities moreover a variety of processes and activities are interrelated to each other resulting in complicated systems with interactive dynamic nonlinear multi objective multistage multilayer and uncertain features these complexities may be further amplified due to their association with economic consequences if the promises of expected targets are violated mathematical tools are recognized as effective tools that examine environmental and ecological impacts of alternative pollution control and resources conservation actions de paola et al 2021 chakraborty et al 2021 petrosino et al 2021 coppola et al 2021 petrosino et al 2019 loutatidou et al 2017 therefore to facilitate more robust management and planning of resources and environmental systems innovative mathematical tools are able to reflect various combinations of these complexities are desired this research presents a new approach used for the first time to calculate the water footprint of irrigated crops that use coastal groundwater aquifers as a water source considering seawater intrusion is one of the effecting pollutants seawater intrusion footprint swif is launched as a new term for a type of water footprint that defines aquifer pollution due to the excessive groundwater withdrawal from the coastal aquifer this new term differentiates between the water footprint of coastal groundwater pollution caused by seawater intrusion and the grey water footprint which is defined as the amount of water needed to dilute the effect of generated pollutants during the life cycle of any product in this case the new definition of the seawater intrusion footprint is the amount of water necessary to mitigate the pollution impact of the groundwater aquifer due to seawater intrusion using the new approach the water footprint of 12 irrigated crops in the nile delta in egypt that use the coastal groundwater will be re estimated and compared with the current calculations that do not consider the pollution caused by seawater intrusion 2 material and methods 2 1 seawater intrusion mechanism due to the altitude difference freshwater always flows seaward simultaneously the higher pressure and density cause seawater to flow landward both continuous movements keep the system at a dynamic state equilibrium especially in the transition zone where seawater mixes with freshwater chemically the significant difference between freshwater and seawater is their salinity the upper limit of the total dissolved solids tds for freshwater is often taken as 1000 mg tds l other salinity classes that are typically distinguished are brackish saline and hypersaline which have a tds value higher than ocean water salinity average ocean water has 36 000 mg tds l post et al 2018 where fresh groundwater and intruded seawater face in a coastal aquifer a transition zone is formed salinities within this created zone range between freshwater and seawater fig 2 transition zone location and width depend on the groundwater system characteristics if the coastal aquifer is hydraulically connected to the sea intruded seawater forms a wedge that penetrates inland into the aquifer due to the higher density of seawater compared to freshwater a column of seawater exerts more significant pressure than a column of freshwater of the same length because of this seawater can protrude into the aquifer below the land surface inland from the shoreline the fresh groundwater near the coast thus forms a water body that floats on the saline groundwater a first estimate of the thickness of the freshwater lens can be obtained with the formula 1 γ α h where γ is the depth of the lens bottom below sea level h is the elevation of the groundwater table above sea level and the α factor is usually around 40 due to the difference in density between freshwater and standard seawater post et al 2018 the ghyben herzberg analytical solution was the first to address the problem of the saltwater wedge after that many other mathematical solutions were presented the verruijt analytical solution widely accepted and used in recent years as provided below glover 1959 verruijt 1969 2 z q 2 β 2 κ 2 1 β 1 β 2 q x β κ 1 β 3 η f 2 β q κ 1 β χ 4 x 0 q 2 β κ in equation 2 z is the depth of the freshwater saltwater interface below the water table m in equation 3 hf is the equivalent freshwater head m in equation 4 x0 is the position of the freshwater saltwater interface at the ground surface positive values are from the shoreline toward the sea and negative values are inland from the shoreline the terms of the equations are defined as follows 5 q

between freshwater ρ f 1 0 gr cm 3 and saltwater ρ f s 1 013 gr cm 3 k is the hydraulic conductivity m d b is the aquifer thickness m and x is the distance m from the shoreline inland high k values lead to a shallow interface while low k values give a deep interface essaid 1990 since the interface s depth is related to aquifer lithological characteristics 2 2 water footprint calculations the methods of calculating the three water footprint types have been reviewed such as green water footprint blue water footprint and grey water footprint as follows green water footprint this type of water footprint is particularly relevant for forestry and crops where it refers to the total rainwater evapotranspiration from soils and plantations plus the water incorporated into the harvested crop or wood so the green water footprint is equal to 8 w f p r o c g r e e n g r e e n w a t e r e v a p o r a t i o n g r e e n w a t e r i n c o r p o r a t i o n v o l u m e t i m e green water consumption in agriculture can be calculated or estimated with a set of empirical formulas or with a suitable crop model for estimating evapotranspiration based on input data on soil crop and climate characteristics the last component green water incorporation refers to the part of the return flow that is not available for reuse within the same basin and the same withdrawal time arjen et al 2011 blue water footprint the blue water footprint indicates consumptive use of available surface or groundwater in a certain period which does not mean that the water disappears because water will remain within the cycle and always return somewhere so it provides a measure of the amount of available blue water consumed by humans the blue water footprint is equal to 9 w f p r o c b l u e b l u e w a t e r e v a p o r a t i o n b l u e w a t e r i n c o r p o r a t i o n v o l u m e t i m e sometimes especially in our study case if there is shared use of groundwater with surface water so the blue water footprint can be divided into the surface blue water footprint the groundwater blue footprint so the blue water footprint is equal to 10 w f p r o c b l u e b l u e g r o u n d w a t e r e v a p o r a t i o n b l u e s u r f a c e w a t e r e v a p o r a t i o n b l u e w a t e r i n c o r p o r a t i o n v o l u m e t i m e the last component blue water incorporation refers to the part of the return flow that is not available for reuse within the same basin and the same withdrawal time either because it is returned to another basin or returned to the environment at another time arjen et al 2011 grey water footprint mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 presented calculations of the global water footprint of crops production for 1996 to 2005 they found that the share of grey water footprint is around 10 of the total water footprint the grey water footprint is calculated by dividing the pollutant load l in mass time by the difference between the ambient water quality standard for that pollutant cmax in mass volume and its natural concentration of receiving water body cnat in mass volume 11 wf p r o c g r e y l c m a x c n a t v o l u m e t i m e greywater footprint is calculated using ambient water quality standards for the receiving freshwater body because the grey water footprint shows the required ambient water volume to assimilate chemicals and pollutants the ambient water quality standard may vary from one to another water body also the natural concentration may differ from one place to another as a result a specific pollutant load can result in two or more grey water footprints depending on the site estimate the leaching runoff fraction for diffuse pollution sources the amount of chemical that reaches a body of water groundwater or surface water depends on the leaching runoff fraction of the applied chemical this fraction is the percentage of a chemical lost to surface water by runoff or to groundwater by leaching fig 3 the contributions of artificial drainage generally and interior drainage end in surface waters within a relatively short period in most cases the groundwater also reaches the surface waters such as rivers and lakes but the transport time by the land flow is much shorter than the transport through the deep groundwater franke et al 2013 calculating the chemical load in the case of diffuse sources of water pollution is not as straightforward the pollutant load is the fraction of the total amount of applied chemicals on or into the soil and reaches the groundwater or and surface water the number of chemicals used can be measured but the fraction of applied chemicals that reach groundwater or surface water cannot be measured since they diffusely enter the water so it is unclear where and when to measure therefore it is common use a simple model that assumes a certain fixed fraction of the applied chemicals finally reaches the groundwater or surface water franke et al 2013 12 wf p r o c g r e y l c m a x c n a t α x a p p l c m a x c n a t v o l u m e t i m e the dimensionless factor α stands for the leaching runoff fraction defined as the fraction of applied chemicals reaching freshwater bodies the variable appl represents the application of chemicals on or into the soil in a specific process in mass time 2 3 seawater intrusion water footprint swif the massive increase in water demands has greatly intensified groundwater extraction especially in coastal areas famiglietti 2014 however adverse effects occur when there is an excessive groundwater withdrawal faster than the natural recharge rate so groundwater aquifer contaminated by saltwater is considered one of the most common threats in the coastal areas and any groundwater abstraction volume can share in groundwater degradation fig 4 duan 2016 in this study seawater intrusion footprint is a new term that has been launched for the first time for a new type of water footprint that defines the aquifer pollution by seawater intrusion due to the excessive withdrawal from the aquifer this new term differentiates between the water footprint of groundwater pollution caused by seawater intrusion and the grey water footprint that defined as the amount of water needed to dilute the effect of generated pollutants during the life cycle of any crop product or commodity in this case the new definition of the seawater intrusion footprint swif will be the amount of water necessary to mitigate the pollution impact of the groundwater aquifer due to seawater intrusion swif has been estimated on realistic assumptions as follows a first assumption the total water footprint of any irrigated crop in the coastal area will contain one or more of the following components green water footprint blue surface water footprint blue renewable groundwater water footprint blue coastal groundwater water footprint grey water footprint seawater intrusion footprint swif b second assumption the amount of water needed to remove the impact of seawater pollution is the same as the amount of water withdrawn from the coastal groundwater aquifers and used in growing crops or producing any product c the third assumption to apply the new approach it is required that the aquifer is coastal and is affected by the seawater intrusion when groundwater abstraction while this approach cannot be applied to renewable aquifers that are not affected by seawater intrusion based on these assumptions the swif is equal to the blue coastal groundwater footprint for irrigated crops products goods or services 13 wf s e a w a t e r int r u s i o

calculate the water footprint for irrigated crops in the coastal areas the new approach considers the irrigation water source such as coastal groundwater whether renewable or non renewable groundwater green water and surface water fig 5 shows a schematic representation of the new approach components of coastal crops water footprint the figure shows that the return flow is not a part of the water footprint and the water footprint includes blue surface water renewable groundwater coastal aquifer groundwater green water and greywater moreover the indirect water use component on the developed approach the blue water footprint refers to the consumption of blue water resources such as surface water renewable groundwater or coastal groundwater along the supply chain consumption refers to water loss from the available groundwater or surface water body in a catchment area losses occur when water evaporates returns to another basin sea or is incorporated into a product the green water footprint refers to the consumption of green water resources rainwater insofar as it does not become runoff the grey water footprint refers to the volume of freshwater required to assimilate the load of pollutants given natural background concentrations and existing ambient water quality standards seawater intrusion footprint is defined as the volume of fresh water needed to mitigate the effect of seawater intrusion on groundwater aquifer usually equal to the part of coastal groundwater that shares in the product either direct or indirect the water footprint differs from the classical measure of water use in three respects it does not include returned water to where it came from but indirect water is included equation 15 is the general equation which has been developed in this research to calculate the water footprint of irrigated crops in the coastal areas which depends on groundwater from coastal aquifers as a whole or partial source of irrigation 15 wf p r o c wf p r o c g r e e n

information related to the water footprint of 12 crops in the nile delta in egypt from 1995 to 2005 these12 selected crops are irrigated by surface water coastal groundwater and green water in the rainy season making it an ideal case for applying the new approach table 1 shows the water footprint of 12 selected crops 3 1 first scenario coastal groundwater and green water in this scenario the total water footprint for 12 egyptian corps has been re recalculated using the new approach where green water and coastal groundwater are the irrigation water sources fig 6 shows the values of seawater intrusion footprint which equals the blue coastal groundwater footprint and total water footprint for 12 selected crops the main results are apple s seawater intrusion footprint equals 679 m3 ton while its total water footprint equals 1617 m3 ton bananas seawater intrusion footprint equals 470 m3 ton and the total water footprint equals 1038 m3 ton wheat s seawater intrusion footprint equals 470 m3 ton while its total water footprint equals 1038 m3 ton 3 2 second scenario coastal groundwater in this scenario the total water footprint for 12 selected corps has been recalculated using the new approach where the irrigation water source is the coastal groundwater without green water as in fig 7 the green water footprint is zero the blue water footprint was calculated as a summation of the green water footprint and blue water footprint when applying the new approach the seawater intrusion footprint equals the blue coastal groundwater footprint apples seawater intrusion footprint equals 823 m3 ton while the total water footprint for apples equals 1761 m3 ton bananas seawater intrusion footprint equals 511 m3 ton while the total water footprint for bananas equals 1079

egypt with different water resources such as the following green and surface water or and renewable groundwater non coastal aquifer surface water or and renewable groundwater non coastal aquifer green and coastal groundwater aquifer coastal groundwater aquifer the newly developed approach ccwfa accounts for seawater intrusion footprint as a part of the total water footprint of crops in the nile

water by comparing the results of applying the new approach with those results calculated by mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 it became clear that the water footprint of these selected 12crops is more significant due to seawater intrusion environmental and ecological effects in the coastal region because of the excessive withdrawal of groundwater the following are the most important results apples
