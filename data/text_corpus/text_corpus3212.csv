16060,the blue lentic belt is a spatial belt of dense lentic habitats formed in the mobile river basin since the 1990s and it is imposing considerable environmental stress on local and downstream aquatic habitats depicting the spatiotemporal evolution of the blue lentic belt is essential to understanding its formation and consequential impacts on local environments however relevant discussion on it is absent since the blue lentic belt is a new discovery in this study we developed a retrospective delineation method to visualize the spatiotemporal evolution of the lentic habitats in the mobile river basin and a tesseral model to numerically analyze the spatiotemporal expansion of the blue lentic belt in the developed method the baseline inventory of lentic habitats is first delineated from 2019 sentinel 2 satellite imagery at a spatial resolution of 10 m the baseline inventory is then used to retrospectively delineate the past lentic habitats in the mobile river basin using the national land cover database nlcd kernel density surfaces of lentic habitat image objects are estimated to detect the regions of dense lentic habitats which sequentially form spatiotemporal objects of dense lentic habitats the spatiotemporal objects of dense lentic habitats are projected onto planar space and are then structuralized as groups of spatial tesserae namely α peaks β slopes and γ edges attributes of these tesserae are numerically derived to quantify the spatiotemporal expansion of the blue lentic belt the results indicate that the blue lentic belt has 4 α peaks 3 β slopes and a single γ edge it is formed from 4 stable hotspots α peaks of the densest lentic habitats the expansion of the blue lentic belt ranges about 15 42 km the expansion distance is about 0 57 of the average range of the β slopes in the blue lentic belt indicating a significant change of landscape in the mobile river basin the development of the farm raised catfish industry is considered the main driving force in the formation of the blue lentic belt the outcomes of this study have emphasized the rapid expansion of the blue lentic belt and its negative impacts on local and downstream aquatic habitats which calls for attention to systemic investigations by multiple disciplines graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords lentic habitats spatiotemporal evolution retrospective delineation tesseral model blue lentic belt mobile river basin 1 introduction a striking blue lentic belt is recently detected in the mobile river basin in the southeastern united states liu et al 2021 the formation of this belt is triggered by the leading farm raised catfish industry in alabama and mississippi bebak et al 2015 schrader and dennis 2005 from the 1990s to recent years these two states had a massive wave of development in the farm raised catfish industry this wave contributed to a booming of artificial fishponds in the mobile river basin these fishponds are new inland freshwater lentic aquatic habitats and they spatially aggregated in the coastal plain in the mobile river basin to form a belt of dense lentic habitats namely the blue lentic belt liu et al 2021 the blue lentic belt is a recently formed landmark on a large basin scale and it is a significant reformation of landscape due to anthropogenic activities besides tons of catfish products and million dollars of business brought by the farm raised catfish industry within this belt the blue lentic belt has also raised public concerns about its negative impacts on local environments e g the concentration of nutrients due to the feeding of catfish belfiore et al 2021 the higher risk to eutrophication and harmful algae blooms habs boyd 2017 and the alert on the water safety for the downstream municipal water usage before investigating these issues it is necessary to first understand the spatiotemporal evolution of the blue lentic belt the development of geographic information science giscience has promoted the emergence of diversified spatiotemporal models for visualizing analyzing and predicting the spatiotemporal evolution of various natural phenomena and human behaviors andrienko et al 2003 kwan 2004 in these visualization models space and time are two independent dimensions for tracing the spatiotemporal evolution of natural or anthropogenic phenomena the fundamental visualization models partially emphasize just one of these two dimensions they could be either the time series of snapshots of the phenomena he et al 2021 li et al 2020 or the plots of regional statistics of the phenomena against time de luca and pizzolante 2021 the first type highlights high spatial resolution and accurate spatial information while the other type highlights high temporal resolution and accurate temporal information advanced spatiotemporal visualization models further integrate the spatial and temporal information into a single entity namely the spatiotemporal objects or other similar terminology in these advanced visualization models order matters the first paradigm initially controls the time variable to form a time series of snapshots delineates the spatial objects on each snapshot and then integrates the temporally adjacent spatial objects along time e g the unified spatiotemporal information model worboys 1994 the model of three domain representation yuan 1999 the model of event representation yuan 2001 the hill tessellation model sadahiro 2001 the model of geo atom representation goodchild et al 2007 and the continuous spatial model van de weghe et al 2014 the other paradigm initially controls the spatial variable to create a time series plot in each location delineates the temporal objects on each time series plot then aggregates these spatially adjacent temporal objects in space e g the wave tessellation model sadahiro 2001 the triangular model qiang et al 2014 and the wave propagation model liu 2022 given available data and their properties different questions particularly have their most proper spatiotemporal visualization models generally controlling the time variable is more efficient for spatially redundant data while controlling the space variable is more efficient for temporally redundant data to uncover the story in the development of the blue lentic belt it is necessary to exclude other aquatic habitats and map only the lentic habitats in the past this is challenging due to limited available data and the huge amount of aquatic habitats in this large basin a retrospective delineation method and a tesseral model are developed in this study to depict the spatiotemporal evolution of the lentic habitats in the mobile river basin in the last 30 years the proposed retrospective delineation method is the first attempt to automatically delineate past lentic habitats on a large scope while excluding past lotic habitats the results are the first visualizations of the process that forms the blue lentic belt through a tesseral model and surface similarity analysis for the rest of this paper we first introduce the study area and the available data sets the developed retrospective delineation method and the proposed tesseral model are then presented step by step the following section evaluates the accuracy of the delineation summarizes the results and discusses the driving factor and the environmental impacts of the spatiotemporal evolution of the blue lentic belt in the mobile river basin finally we draw the main conclusions 2 study area and data sets 2 1 study area the mobile river basin is located in the southeast of the united states it is the sixth largest basin in the u s and it partially covers alabama mississippi georgia and tennessee mcpherson et al 2003 about 70 of the land in the mobile river basin is covered by forest 26 by agricultural land and 3 by urban area atkins et al 2004 mcpherson et al 2003 the intensive agricultural activities are concentrated in the coastal plain since the 19th century which consequentially forms a spatial belt of dense agricultural land namely the black prairie belt webster and samson 1992 the spatially aggregated agricultural land in the black prairie belt is contained in 22 counties 12 of them in alabama and 10 in mississippi these counties are referred to as the black belt counties fig 1 which then have a long history of developing farming as their primary economic activity barone 2005 cleland 1920 the mobile river basin also has dense and broadly distributed inland freshwater aquatic habitats including both lentic and lotic habitats liu et al 2021 the lentic and lotic habitats should be separately investigated since they are quite different from each other lentic habitats have standing water and the water has a long residence time e g lakes and fishponds on the contrary lotic habitats have flowing water and the water has a short residence time e g creeks streams and rivers bain et al 1999 the disparity determines the different interactions between lentic lotic habitats and local environments e g disparities in the concentration of water pollutants and different risks to harmful algae blooms habs the outlet lotic habitat is the mobile river and it is formed by the confluence of two large and long rivers namely the tombigbee river and the alabama river the outlet of the mobile river connects to the mobile bay which is the front gate to the gulf of mexico the precipitation is almost even in the mobile river basin with a bit more rainfall in winter and spring and less in summer and autumn liu et al 2005 the small variation of precipitation results in an insignificant wet season and a dry season correspondingly the discharge of the mobile river peaks in march and it reaches the minimum flow in late summer when the evapotranspiration in the basin is the highest schroeder et al 1990 the geographic settings of the mobile river basin are particularly suitable for the aquaculture of channel catfish from the 1980s to recent years the mobile river basin just went through a wave of development in the farm raised catfish industry hargreaves and tucker 2004 numerous artificial fishponds were constructed in this wave these fishponds are spatially aggregated to form a spatial belt of dense lentic habitats in the mobile river basin and it overlaps well with the black prairie belt fig 1 the belt of dense lentic habitats is first observed in liu s 2019 inventory of lentic habitats in the mobile river basin and then it is named after the blue lentic belt liu et al 2021 2 2 data sets two sets of data are collected in this study the first set is used to delineate the baseline inventory of lentic lotic habitats in the mobile river basin and the second set is used to retrospectively delineate the inventories of past lentic habitats the data used to delineate the baseline inventory of lentic habitats in the mobile river basin include 21 tiles of sentinel 2 multispectral imagery and 23 tiles of digital elevation model dem both datasets fully cover the mobile river basin the sentinel 2 images are collected from the european space agency esa copernicus open access hub https scihub copernicus eu dhus home these images are level c image products that represent the top of atmosphere toa reflectance of the land surface drusch et al 2012 and they have a cloud coverage of less than 1 the capture dates of these images are within the wet season of the mobile river basin in 2019 which enables the delineation of the maximum extent of these lentic habitats as the baseline only the blue green red and near infrared nir bands at 10 m spatial resolution are employed to provide adequate spectral signatures and spatial resolution frampton et al 2013 the dem data are from the united states geological survey usgs national elevation dataset ned gesch et al 2002 these ned tiles are collected from usgs national map https apps nationalmap gov downloader the spatial resolution of the ned is also 10 m the second set of data includes the land cover maps collected from the national land cover database nlcd these land cover maps are collected from usgs multi resolution land characteristics consortium mrlc https www mrlc gov the second generation of nlcd has an initial release in 2001 and it is periodically and consistently updated in 2004 2006 2008 2011 2013 and 2016 wickham et al 2014 these land cover maps are derived from landsat imagery at a spatial resolution of 30 m the classification scheme of the land cover in nlcd is modified from the anderson land cover classification system anderson 1976 the nlcd classification scheme has two levels and in total 20 subcategories open water surface in this system is coded as 11 wickham et al 2021 on the other hand the nlcd 1992 is downloaded from usgs sciencebase catalog https www sciencebase gov catalog item 5dfbcd38e4b0ff479b8c459f nlcd 1992 is the first generation of nlcd it is not included together with other nlcd land cover maps since the mapping method of nlcd 1992 is significantly different wickham et al 2014 however nlcd 1992 shares the same classification scheme and spatial resolution as other nlcd land cover maps the water surface is also coded as 11 in nlcd 1992 and it is comparable to the water surface category on other nlcd land cover maps according to available assessment results the classification accuracy of nlcd maps is adequate the user accuracy of open water class in this region is 97 for 1992 stehman et al 2003 94 for 2001 wickham et al 2010 94 for 2006 wickham et al 2013 86 89 for 2011 wickham et al 2017 and 92 99 for 2016 wickham et al 2021 respectively the hydrologic units hus at the level of 4 are collected from the usgs watershed boundary dataset wbd these supplementary data are used to delineate the boundary of the mobile river basin 3 methods in this study both lentic and lotic habitats are represented by the open water surface on the image the baseline lentic lotic habitat inventory is firstly delineated from 2019 sentinel 2 images at 10 m spatial resolution using liu s method liu et al 2021 the baseline lentic lotic habitat inventory is then used as a reference to retrospectively delineate the lentic habitats in the past 30 years from nlcd maps at 30 m spatial resolution the kernel density maps of lentic habitats are estimated to visualize the spatiotemporal evolution of the dense lentic habitats in the mobile river basin especially the blue lentic belt a tesseral model is then developed to structuralize the spatiotemporal evolution of the blue lentic belt into α peaks β slopes and γ edges finally critical attributes of these tesserae are numerically derived to quantify the spatiotemporal evolution of the blue lentic belt a flowchart that illustrates this workflow is shown in fig 2 3 1 the delineation of baseline lentic habitats the delineation of baseline lentic lotic habitats is a production from sentinel 2 imagery liu et al 2021 the iterative self organizing data analysis technique isodata unsupervised classification method dubes and jain 1976 tou and gonzalez 1974 is first used to identify the water surface pixels from sentinel 2 msi level 1c top of atmosphere toa reflectance image for better classification accuracy the isodata classification generates 12 to 15 clusters of spectrally homogeneous pixels the clusters of water surface pixels are visually interpreted and coded as 1 the other clusters are coded as 0 the region growing algorithm sonka et al 2014 is then implemented to form discrete aquatic habitat image objects to separate lentic habitat image objects from lotic habitat image objects the drainage network of the entire mobile river basin is employed as a reference if an aquatic habitat image object spatially intersects with the streamlines in the drainage network it will be determined as a lotic habitat image object otherwise the aquatic habitat image object will be determined as a lentic habitat image object the drainage network is hydrologically derived from the usgs ned using the d8 algorithm and flow accumulation o callaghan and mark 1984 the delineated drainage network has the same spatial resolution as the sentinel 2 imagery in this study 21 sentinel 2 image tiles were processed in the environment of envi 5 3 and idl 8 5 to fully cover the entire mobile river basin the outputs from all tiles were merged and dissolved into a single data file erroneous aquatic habitat image objects e g shadows were removed through inspection correspondingly 23 ned tiles were merged to hydrologically derive the drainage network of the entire mobile river basin using arcgis 10 5 the separated lotic and lentic habitat image objects were converted into two polygon shapefiles to achieve a reliable delineation of aquatic habitats the minimum mapping unit is set to 1 0 ha image objects smaller than the minimum mapping unit are considered unreliable and are removed because the sentinel 2 image tiles all are captured in the wet season of the mobile river basin in 2019 the baseline inventory then represents the maximum extent of the lentic lotic habitats in 2019 for a better reference the baseline inventory is hereafter named the 2019 inventory 3 2 retrospective delineation of past lentic habitats the nlcd maps are first used to retrospectively delineate the past aquatic habitats the first and second generations of nlcd maps share the same classification scheme which is modified from the anderson land use land cover classification system anderson 1976 in the nlcd classification scheme open water is coded as 11 wickham et al 2021 a binary reclassification is applied to the nlcd maps to separate the open water surface from other land covers the open water pixels code 11 on the nlcd maps are recoded as 1 and the other pixels are recoded as 0 since we use open water surfaces to represent aquatic habitats the nlcd binary reclassification results namely the nlcd open water masks well represent the past aquatic habitats and their representations are consistent with the 2019 inventory the delineated 2019 inventory of lentic lotic habitat image objects is then used as a reference to retrospectively delineate the past lentic habitats from nlcd open water masks the nlcd maps are classification products from landsat imagery at 30 m spatial resolution the coarse spatial resolution makes it impossible to delineate spatially adjacent lentic lotic habitats as individual image objects fig 3 and it is thus impossible to separate the lentic habitats from lotic habitats using the drainage network the alternative approach we developed is to use the lotic habitat image objects in the 2019 inventory as a reference to remove the past lotic habitats in the nlcd open water masks the nlcd open water masks are first converted into polygons in a vector format namely the nlcd open water polygons we assume that the lotic habitats in the mobile river basin had little change from the 1990s to the 2020s a visual examination of the nlcd maps indicates that this assumption is valid for the mobile river basin the past lentic habitats are derived from the nlcd open water polygons by erasing the lotic habitat polygons in the 2019 inventory since nlcd open water polygons are derived at a spatial resolution of 30 m but the 2019 inventory are derived at 10 m a 30 m buffer the nlcd pixel size is created for each lotic habitat polygon in the 2019 inventory to mitigate the edge displacement caused by the different spatial resolutions residuals smaller than the minimum mapping unit 1 0 ha after erasing are considered noise and are removed from nlcd 1992 to nlcd 2016 the past lentic habitats are delineated at each time node using the analysis tools in arcgis 10 5 the delineated inventories of past lentic habitats are named after the year numbers of the nlcd maps e g from the 1992 inventory to the 2016 inventory together with the 2019 inventory the spatiotemporal evolution of the lentic habitats in the mobile river basin is depicted at 9 discrete time nodes in the last 30 years 3 3 structuralize the spatiotemporal evolution of the blue lentic belt kernel density maps are used to represent the general spatial distribution pattern of the past lentic habitats in the mobile river basin and to show the spatiotemporal evolution of the blue lentic belt at each time node from 1992 to 2019 the lentic habitat image objects are converted into polygons in a vector format the centroid and the areal size of each polygon are numerically derived the kernel density estimation uses the centroid points of the lentic habitat image objects as their locations and the areal sizes of these lentic habitat image objects as the weights silverman 2018 the resulting kernel density map represents the proportion of open water surface to all the land cover types unit in ha per km2 in total 9 kernel density maps are estimated using arcgis 10 5 we further developed a spatial tesseral model based on sadahiro s surface similarity analysis sadahiro and masui 2004 to depict the structure in the spatiotemporal evolution of the lentic habitats in the mobile river basin especially along the blue lentic belt on each kernel density map a threshold d 0 6 ha per km2 is set to distinguish the dense lentic habitat zones from their adjacent background noise and a boundary is traced along with the location where the open water surface proportion equals the threshold d this optimal and universal threshold is determined through a trial and error strategy to maximize contrast between the dense lentic habitat areas and the background the spatially intersected and temporally adjacent regions of dense lentic habitats are sequentially stacked together to form a spatiotemporal object of the dense lentic habitats a spatiotemporal object of dense lentic habitats delineates the sub space time of the dense lentic habitats and shows the spatiotemporal evolution of the dense lentic habitats on the other hand a peak point is mounted to each local maximum open water surface proportion these peak points indicate the locations of the local densest lentic habitats the boundaries of the spatiotemporal objects and peak points within them at the 9 time nodes are projected onto a planar space to delineate the critical components in the spatiotemporal evolution of the lentic habitats three types of critical components are delineated from these boundaries and peak points α peaks β slopes and γ edges these are tesserae that spatially cover the region of interest an α peak is a minimum circle to include all spatiotemporally adjacent peak points a γ edge is a region bounded by the intersection of all inner most edges and the intersection of all outer most edges a β slope is the region outside the circle of α peaks but inside the inner edge of γ edges these three critical components indicate different characteristics in the spatiotemporal evolution of lentic habitats an α peak indicates the migration of the densest lentic habitats a small α peak indicates a stable region of concentrated lentic habitats while a large α peak indicates an apparent spatial migration of the densest lentic habitats a γ edge is the zonal change of the dense lentic habitats from or to the regions that have no dense lentic habitats it indicates either spatial expansion or shrinkage a β slope is a structurally stable component in the spatiotemporal evolution of the lentic habitats from the α peak to the γ edge the β slope shows the monotone gradient from dense lentic habitats to sparse lentic habitats with only changes in density values over time 3 4 derive essential attributes of the spatial tesserae multiple sorts of attributes are numerically derived from the α peaks β slopes and γ edges these attributes quantitatively describe the spatiotemporal evolution of the lentic habitats in the mobile river basin especially the blue lentic belt the centroids perimeters p α and radiuses r α of these α peaks are first numerically derived a small radius indicates a small α peak and a stable region of densest lentic habitats in contrast a large radius indicates a large α peak and an apparent spatial migration of densest lentic habitats secondly the inner perimeters p β i n the outer perimeters p β o u t and the area sizes a β of these β slopes are also numerically derived the range of the β slope r β is then defined as r β a β 1 2 p β i n p β o u t the range of the β slope r β indicates the extent of the structurally stable component in the spatiotemporal evolution of the dense lentic habitats finally the inner perimeters p γ i n the outer perimeters p γ o u t and the area sizes a γ of these γ edges are numerically derived the range of the γ edge r γ is then defined as r γ a γ 1 2 p γ i n p γ o u t the range of the γ edge r γ indicates the zonal changes of the dense lentic habitats a small r γ indicates little change in the spatial extent of dense lentic habitats over the study period but a large r γ indicates a broader change in the spatial extent of dense lentic habitats on the other hand the γ β range ratio is also calculated from the r γ divided by the average r β of the β slopes inside the γ edge the γ β range ratio indicates the stability of the spatiotemporal evolution a small ratio indicates a stable spatiotemporal object with insignificant zonal changes while a large ratio indicates a dynamic spatiotemporal object with apparent zonal changes 4 results and discussions 4 1 the delineation of the baseline and retrospective inventory of the lentic habitats the retrospective delineation method developed in this study has successfully removed the lotic habitats from open water masks the 2019 inventory of lentic habitats in the mobile river basin includes 18 483 isolated lentic habitat image objects the 2019 inventory has excluded 675 lotic habitat image objects the open water surface of delineated lentic habitats in the mobile river basin has an area of about 793 69 km2 while the open water surface of excluded lotic habitats has an area of about 1290 22 km2 the large area size of the excluded lotic habitat image objects indicates that it is necessary to exclude them while analyzing the spatial distribution of the lentic habitats otherwise the considerable area of lotic habitats may lead to the biased structure of the spatiotemporal evolution of the lentic habitats and erroneous conclusions using the 2019 inventory as a reference the developed retrospective delineation method enables the exclusion of the past lotic habitats in the mobile river basin and keeps only these past lentic habitats from nlcd 1992 to nlcd 2016 to our best knowledge the developed retrospective delineation method is the first method that enables us to analyze the spatiotemporal evolution of purely lentic habitats and the separate analyses of lentic and lotic habitats and their environmental impacts are hereafter feasible using gis rs approaches on a large spatiotemporal scope this approach is data driven and it can be applied to other regions if equivalent data are available the lentic habitats have been successfully delineated and separated from lotic habitats in the mobile river basin fig 3 two issues due to the multisource data may inevitably degrade the consistency of the analysis but the impacts are limited first the method to map the nlcd 1992 is claimed to be significantly different from the nlcd 2001 2016 maps wickham et al 2014 however the difference in map results is mainly in developed regions since open water surface has a strong spectral signature ngoc et al 2019 it is easy to achieve high classification accuracy for this single type of land cover regardless of supervised or unsupervised classification methods phiri et al 2020 hence for the study objective namely the aquatic habitats it is proper to assume that the 1992 inventory of lentic habitats is comparable to other nlcd based inventories secondly the nlcd based inventories are derived at the 30 m spatial resolution while the 2019 inventory is derived at the 10 m spatial resolution the adjacent but isolated lentic habitats on the 2019 inventory especially fishponds are fused into larger lentic habitats due to the coarse spatial resolution in the nlcd based inventories the coarse resolution leads to considerable underestimation in the total number of lentic habitats in the nlcd based inventories the area of each lentic habitat is thus employed to calculate the total area of lentic habitats rather than using the total number of lentic habitats the area of each lentic habitat is used as the weight while estimating the kernel density to mitigate the impacts from coarse spatial resolution and underestimated lentic habitat number the inventories of lentic habitats have high validity to analyze the spatiotemporal evolution of the lentic habitats in the mobile river basin especially the blue lentic belt the 2019 inventory has shown high spatial accuracy in location boundary and areal size liu et al 2021 erroneous and specious lentic habitats are removed through visual inspection on the other side the nlcd based inventories also have a high classification accuracy of open water surfaces see section 2 2 the high thematic accuracy of the inventories grounds the solid foundation for the spatiotemporal analysis of the lentic habitats in the mobile river basin moreover the 2019 inventory is derived from the sentinel 2 imagery obtained in the wet season of the mobile river basin an alternative tile of sentinel 2 image obtained in the dry season august in 2019 shows the ignorable seasonal changes of lentic habitats in the center of the blue lentic belt no lentic habitats disappeared or newly occurred between the wet and dry seasons in total 961 lentic habitats are investigated and the areal shrink is about 7 69 4 2 the spatiotemporal evolution of the blue lentic belt given the proposed tesseral model in this study the regions of dense lentic habitats are delineated at 9 time nodes in the past 30 years in the mobile river basin fig 4 the spatiotemporal evolution of the dense lentic habitats is then structuralized into three groups of tesserae fig 5 the largest tesserae overlay well with the blue lentic belt and they uncover the spatial expansion of the dense lentic habitats in the blue lentic belt since the 1990s the blue lentic belt tesserae have 4 α peaks 3 β slopes and a single γ edge they indicate that the dense lentic habitats in the blue lentic belt initially formed 4 hot spots and then these hot spots gradually merged into a single long belt two groups of tesserae are also discovered in the mobile river basin beside the blue lentic belt tesserae one group overlaps well with the city of birmingham al in the usa the other overlaps well with the confluence region of the tombigbee river and the alabama river these three groups of tesserae have different driving factors the blue lentic belt tesserae are driven by the inland farm raised catfish industry the birmingham tesserae are driven by the urban sprawl and the confluence tesserae is basically a natural spatiotemporal evolution of lentic habitats the quantitative attributes of each α peak β slope and γ edge are numerically derived respectively tables 1 2 and 3 the dense lentic habitats in the mobile river basin have a relatively stable central tendency indicated by the small values of r α the largest r α is about 6 49 km which means the maximum migration of densest lentic habitats is within 13 km 2 r α the α peaks in the blue lentic belt show two patterns in central tendency the α 1 and α 2 have the most stable aggregation of lentic habitats over time their r α values are less than 2 km in contrast the α 3 and α 4 have a comparatively less stable aggregation of lentic habitats over time indicated by larger values of r α the blue lentic belt has the largest structurally stable components in the spatiotemporal evolution of the lentic habitats it has three β slopes and they have a total area size of 16 310 15 km2 and an average range of 27 21 km the γ β range ratio of the blue lentic belt tesserae is 0 57 and it shows a moderate magnitude of spatial expansion in comparison the γ β range ratio of the birmingham tesserae is 3 00 and the γ β range ratio of the confluence tesserae is 0 25 these results indicate that the anthropogenic activities e g the urban sprawl may cause a large magnitude of changes in lentic habitats while the natural process in the change of lentic habitats is slow the spatiotemporal evolution of the lentic habitats in the blue lentic belt is in the middle it is slow but considerable the tesseral model successfully visualizes and quantifies the spatial expansion of the blue lentic belt and it also can be applied to other geographic phenomena that locally expand or shrink the delineation of α peaks β slopes and γ edges is variable according to the density threshold d a small d cannot efficiently remove noisy and erroneous spatial objects of dense lentic habitats consequentially the derived tesserae will be unnecessarily complicated on the contrary a large d can only depict the regions of densest lentic habitats which are oversimplified spatial objects to represent the spatiotemporal evolution of the lentic habitats in the mobile river basin the density threshold d is set to 0 6 ha per km2 in this study and it successfully depicts the expansion of the dense lentic habitats in the mobile river basin in the last 30 years especially the blue lentic belt a slight change in the d is going to result in a slight difference in the shape of the delineated tesserae and their quantitative attributes however the slightly changed tesserae can also successfully represent the spatiotemporal evolution of the dense lentic habitats and they will still lead to the same conclusions in this study 4 3 the development of the farm raised catfish industry and their environmental impacts the farm raised catfish industry is considered the primary driving force of the spatiotemporal evolution of lentic habitats in the blue lentic belt the reported open water surface area sizes of catfish ponds in alabama are collected from the united states department of agriculture usda https usda library cornell edu concern publications bg257f046 locale en release items these area sizes are reported by usda every july from 1988 to 2020 and they are used to represent the development of the farm raised catfish industry in the mobile river basin these usda reports also include the open water surface area sizes of catfish ponds in mississippi however mississippi has two regions of dense lentic habitats and farm raised catfish hargreaves and tucker 2004 schrader and dennis 2005 namely the west larger region and the east smaller region the mobile river basin contains only the smaller east region of mississippi the joined statistics of catfish ponds in mississippi cannot represent the evolution of the lentic habitats in the mobile river basin and they are excluded the open water surface area sizes of catfish ponds in alabama and the lentic habitat area sizes derived in this study are together plotted against time fig 6 the plot is then used to interpret the evolution of the blue lentic belt in the mobile river basin an apparent coincidental trend is observable in the temporal evolution of the lentic habitats in the mobile river basin and the development of the farm raised catfish industry fig 6 the general trend of the farm raised catfish industry in alabama is a unimodal wave in the last 30 years the wave peaked in 2004 with an increasing phase from 1988 to 2004 and a declining phase from 2004 to 2017 the increasing phase of the farm raised catfish industry is consistent with the increase of the lentic habitat open water surface area from 1992 to 2004 indicated by the linear yellow trend line since 2004 the farm raised catfish industry has been shrinking indicated by the linear red trend line however the areal shrinkage of the farm raised catfish industry was particularly due to the abandonment of catfish ponds these abandoned catfish ponds were not refilled as land but were kept as wild lentic habitats this explains the stationary phase of the lentic habitats in the mobile river basin from 2004 to 2016 indicated by the linear blue line the 2019 inventory indicates a further slight increase of lentic habitat open water surface area in the mobile river basin this recent increase on one side may be caused by the recent mild booming of the farm raised catfish industry from 2016 to 2020 on the other side the 2019 inventory is derived from sentinel 2 imagery with a high spatial resolution during the wet season and it represents the maximal extent of the lentic habitats in the mobile river basin the estimation from the maximal extent of the lentic habitats may exaggerate the increase in 2019 however the single point estimation in 2009 will not mislead the general trend in the stationary phase of the lentic habitats in the mobile river basin another thing to notice is that the magnitude of increase in the lentic habitats in the mobile river basin is significantly different from that in catfish pond open water surface this disparity is because of two primary reasons first the dense catfish ponds in the east of mississippi about ten counties are excluded from the statistics since no data are available secondly many artificial ponds were not included in the statistics of the farm raised catfish industry they may be already abandoned before they are used as catfish ponds hence only the trend is used in this study to analyze the correspondence between the spatiotemporal evolution of the lentic habitats in the mobile river basin and the development of the farm raised catfish industry as indicated by the spatiotemporal analysis in this study the blue lentic belt was artificially formed from 4 hotspots of densest lentic habitats in the mobile river basin in the past 30 years the spatial expansion of the dense lentic habitats is considerable and numerous artificial ponds are made along with the development of the farm raised catfish industry in alabama and mississippi a critical concern on the recently formed blue lentic belt is the possible negative impacts on its water quality and aquatic ecosystems first continuous input of feed materials into the fishpond is necessary to raise the catfish this process is an intensive import of nutrients e g nitrogen n and phosphorus p into the lentic habitats numerous studies have emphasized that the overloaded nutrients in the aquatic habitats will increase the risk of eutrophication and harmful algae blooms habs boyd 2017 carmichael and boyer 2016 paerl et al 2020 wurtsbaugh et al 2019 on the other side the blue lentic belt is spatially overlapped with the black prairie belt which has a much longer history of agriculture in the mobile river basin barone 2005 the lentic habitats in the blue lentic belt are tightly enclosed by the agricultural land of the black prairie belt it has been indicated that agricultural land constitutes about one third of the adjacent land cover to the lentic habitats in the blue lentic belt which is much higher than that to the lotic habitats in the mobile river basin liu et al 2021 the intensive agricultural activities further elevate the risks to water quality in these lentic habitats besides extra nutrients imposed by the chemical fertilizers these lentic habitats are also easy to concentrate direct toxicants imposed by pesticides anderson et al 2013 furthermore the environmental impacts are not constrained within the blue lentic belt the two main rivers namely the tombigbee river and the alabama river go through the blue lentic belt the ejected effluents may release the water with concentrated nutrients and toxicants into the lotic habitats the contaminated water then may degrade the water quality of the downstream aquatic habitats endanger the municipal water in downstream counties and increase the risks to aquatic ecosystems in mobile bay and the gulf of mexico however since the blue lentic belt is newly discovered limited studies and discussions are available on this environmental concern this concern calls for attention and is open for more intensive investigations 5 conclusions this study developed a retrospective delineation model and a tesseral model to visualize the spatiotemporal evolution of the blue lentic belt in the mobile river basin in the last 30 years sentinel 2 multispectral remote sensing data are first used to delineate the baseline inventory of lentic habitats in the mobile river basin and to separate the lotic habitats from lentic habitats the land cover maps from nlcd are then used to delineate the past lentic habitats in the mobile river basin kernel density maps of the lentic habitats are estimated to extract the regions of dense lentic habitats which sequentially form the spatiotemporal objects of the dense lentic habitats in the mobile river basin the spatiotemporal objects are projected onto a planar space and are then structuralized as groups of spatial tesserae namely the α peaks β slopes and γ edges the attributes of these spatial tesserae are numerically derived to quantitatively describe the spatiotemporal evolution of the dense lentic habitats in the mobile river basin especially the blue lentic belt the spatiotemporal evolution of the lentic habitats in the mobile river basin is structuralized as three groups of spatial tesserae and the group to represent the blue lentic belt is the dominant one the spatial tesserae of the blue lentic belt include 4 α peaks 3 β slopes and a single γ edge the blue lentic belt is formed from 4 stable hotspots α peaks of the densest lentic habitats the γ β range ratio on the blue lentic belt tesserae is 0 57 the ratio indicates that the spatial expansion γ edge of the blue lentic belt is considerable compared to its stationary monotone regions β slopes the booming of the farm raised catfish industry is considered the main driving force of the spatiotemporal expansion of the blue lentic belt since they share the same trend the booming of the farmed raised catfish industry and the spatiotemporal expansion of the blue lentic belt in the mobile river basin impose increasing stress on the local and downstream aquatic habitats these negative impacts on aquatic habitats need more attention and systematic investigations from the cooperation of multiple disciplines the spatiotemporal evolution of the blue lentic belt is successfully depicted using the retrospective delineation method and the tesseral model developed in this study remote sensing data with high spatial resolution e g the sentinel 2 imagery enable the separation of the lotic and lentic habitats and the retrospective delineation of purely lentic or lotic habitats on a large basin scale respectively the retrospective delineation method is also appliable to the lentic or lotic habitats in other basins and on a broader scope the developed tesseral model is also appliable and transferable to other natural and

16060,the blue lentic belt is a spatial belt of dense lentic habitats formed in the mobile river basin since the 1990s and it is imposing considerable environmental stress on local and downstream aquatic habitats depicting the spatiotemporal evolution of the blue lentic belt is essential to understanding its formation and consequential impacts on local environments however relevant discussion on it is absent since the blue lentic belt is a new discovery in this study we developed a retrospective delineation method to visualize the spatiotemporal evolution of the lentic habitats in the mobile river basin and a tesseral model to numerically analyze the spatiotemporal expansion of the blue lentic belt in the developed method the baseline inventory of lentic habitats is first delineated from 2019 sentinel 2 satellite imagery at a spatial resolution of 10 m the baseline inventory is then used to retrospectively delineate the past lentic habitats in the mobile river basin using the national land cover database nlcd kernel density surfaces of lentic habitat image objects are estimated to detect the regions of dense lentic habitats which sequentially form spatiotemporal objects of dense lentic habitats the spatiotemporal objects of dense lentic habitats are projected onto planar space and are then structuralized as groups of spatial tesserae namely α peaks β slopes and γ edges attributes of these tesserae are numerically derived to quantify the spatiotemporal expansion of the blue lentic belt the results indicate that the blue lentic belt has 4 α peaks 3 β slopes and a single γ edge it is formed from 4 stable hotspots α peaks of the densest lentic habitats the expansion of the blue lentic belt ranges about 15 42 km the expansion distance is about 0 57 of the average range of the β slopes in the blue lentic belt indicating a significant change of landscape in the mobile river basin the development of the farm raised catfish industry is considered the main driving force in the formation of the blue lentic belt the outcomes of this study have emphasized the rapid expansion of the blue lentic belt and its negative impacts on local and downstream aquatic habitats which calls for attention to systemic investigations by multiple disciplines graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords lentic habitats spatiotemporal evolution retrospective delineation tesseral model blue lentic belt mobile river basin 1 introduction a striking blue lentic belt is recently detected in the mobile river basin in the southeastern united states liu et al 2021 the formation of this belt is triggered by the leading farm raised catfish industry in alabama and mississippi bebak et al 2015 schrader and dennis 2005 from the 1990s to recent years these two states had a massive wave of development in the farm raised catfish industry this wave contributed to a booming of artificial fishponds in the mobile river basin these fishponds are new inland freshwater lentic aquatic habitats and they spatially aggregated in the coastal plain in the mobile river basin to form a belt of dense lentic habitats namely the blue lentic belt liu et al 2021 the blue lentic belt is a recently formed landmark on a large basin scale and it is a significant reformation of landscape due to anthropogenic activities besides tons of catfish products and million dollars of business brought by the farm raised catfish industry within this belt the blue lentic belt has also raised public concerns about its negative impacts on local environments e g the concentration of nutrients due to the feeding of catfish belfiore et al 2021 the higher risk to eutrophication and harmful algae blooms habs boyd 2017 and the alert on the water safety for the downstream municipal water usage before investigating these issues it is necessary to first understand the spatiotemporal evolution of the blue lentic belt the development of geographic information science giscience has promoted the emergence of diversified spatiotemporal models for visualizing analyzing and predicting the spatiotemporal evolution of various natural phenomena and human behaviors andrienko et al 2003 kwan 2004 in these visualization models space and time are two independent dimensions for tracing the spatiotemporal evolution of natural or anthropogenic phenomena the fundamental visualization models partially emphasize just one of these two dimensions they could be either the time series of snapshots of the phenomena he et al 2021 li et al 2020 or the plots of regional statistics of the phenomena against time de luca and pizzolante 2021 the first type highlights high spatial resolution and accurate spatial information while the other type highlights high temporal resolution and accurate temporal information advanced spatiotemporal visualization models further integrate the spatial and temporal information into a single entity namely the spatiotemporal objects or other similar terminology in these advanced visualization models order matters the first paradigm initially controls the time variable to form a time series of snapshots delineates the spatial objects on each snapshot and then integrates the temporally adjacent spatial objects along time e g the unified spatiotemporal information model worboys 1994 the model of three domain representation yuan 1999 the model of event representation yuan 2001 the hill tessellation model sadahiro 2001 the model of geo atom representation goodchild et al 2007 and the continuous spatial model van de weghe et al 2014 the other paradigm initially controls the spatial variable to create a time series plot in each location delineates the temporal objects on each time series plot then aggregates these spatially adjacent temporal objects in space e g the wave tessellation model sadahiro 2001 the triangular model qiang et al 2014 and the wave propagation model liu 2022 given available data and their properties different questions particularly have their most proper spatiotemporal visualization models generally controlling the time variable is more efficient for spatially redundant data while controlling the space variable is more efficient for temporally redundant data to uncover the story in the development of the blue lentic belt it is necessary to exclude other aquatic habitats and map only the lentic habitats in the past this is challenging due to limited available data and the huge amount of aquatic habitats in this large basin a retrospective delineation method and a tesseral model are developed in this study to depict the spatiotemporal evolution of the lentic habitats in the mobile river basin in the last 30 years the proposed retrospective delineation method is the first attempt to automatically delineate past lentic habitats on a large scope while excluding past lotic habitats the results are the first visualizations of the process that forms the blue lentic belt through a tesseral model and surface similarity analysis for the rest of this paper we first introduce the study area and the available data sets the developed retrospective delineation method and the proposed tesseral model are then presented step by step the following section evaluates the accuracy of the delineation summarizes the results and discusses the driving factor and the environmental impacts of the spatiotemporal evolution of the blue lentic belt in the mobile river basin finally we draw the main conclusions 2 study area and data sets 2 1 study area the mobile river basin is located in the southeast of the united states it is the sixth largest basin in the u s and it partially covers alabama mississippi georgia and tennessee mcpherson et al 2003 about 70 of the land in the mobile river basin is covered by forest 26 by agricultural land and 3 by urban area atkins et al 2004 mcpherson et al 2003 the intensive agricultural activities are concentrated in the coastal plain since the 19th century which consequentially forms a spatial belt of dense agricultural land namely the black prairie belt webster and samson 1992 the spatially aggregated agricultural land in the black prairie belt is contained in 22 counties 12 of them in alabama and 10 in mississippi these counties are referred to as the black belt counties fig 1 which then have a long history of developing farming as their primary economic activity barone 2005 cleland 1920 the mobile river basin also has dense and broadly distributed inland freshwater aquatic habitats including both lentic and lotic habitats liu et al 2021 the lentic and lotic habitats should be separately investigated since they are quite different from each other lentic habitats have standing water and the water has a long residence time e g lakes and fishponds on the contrary lotic habitats have flowing water and the water has a short residence time e g creeks streams and rivers bain et al 1999 the disparity determines the different interactions between lentic lotic habitats and local environments e g disparities in the concentration of water pollutants and different risks to harmful algae blooms habs the outlet lotic habitat is the mobile river and it is formed by the confluence of two large and long rivers namely the tombigbee river and the alabama river the outlet of the mobile river connects to the mobile bay which is the front gate to the gulf of mexico the precipitation is almost even in the mobile river basin with a bit more rainfall in winter and spring and less in summer and autumn liu et al 2005 the small variation of precipitation results in an insignificant wet season and a dry season correspondingly the discharge of the mobile river peaks in march and it reaches the minimum flow in late summer when the evapotranspiration in the basin is the highest schroeder et al 1990 the geographic settings of the mobile river basin are particularly suitable for the aquaculture of channel catfish from the 1980s to recent years the mobile river basin just went through a wave of development in the farm raised catfish industry hargreaves and tucker 2004 numerous artificial fishponds were constructed in this wave these fishponds are spatially aggregated to form a spatial belt of dense lentic habitats in the mobile river basin and it overlaps well with the black prairie belt fig 1 the belt of dense lentic habitats is first observed in liu s 2019 inventory of lentic habitats in the mobile river basin and then it is named after the blue lentic belt liu et al 2021 2 2 data sets two sets of data are collected in this study the first set is used to delineate the baseline inventory of lentic lotic habitats in the mobile river basin and the second set is used to retrospectively delineate the inventories of past lentic habitats the data used to delineate the baseline inventory of lentic habitats in the mobile river basin include 21 tiles of sentinel 2 multispectral imagery and 23 tiles of digital elevation model dem both datasets fully cover the mobile river basin the sentinel 2 images are collected from the european space agency esa copernicus open access hub https scihub copernicus eu dhus home these images are level c image products that represent the top of atmosphere toa reflectance of the land surface drusch et al 2012 and they have a cloud coverage of less than 1 the capture dates of these images are within the wet season of the mobile river basin in 2019 which enables the delineation of the maximum extent of these lentic habitats as the baseline only the blue green red and near infrared nir bands at 10 m spatial resolution are employed to provide adequate spectral signatures and spatial resolution frampton et al 2013 the dem data are from the united states geological survey usgs national elevation dataset ned gesch et al 2002 these ned tiles are collected from usgs national map https apps nationalmap gov downloader the spatial resolution of the ned is also 10 m the second set of data includes the land cover maps collected from the national land cover database nlcd these land cover maps are collected from usgs multi resolution land characteristics consortium mrlc https www mrlc gov the second generation of nlcd has an initial release in 2001 and it is periodically and consistently updated in 2004 2006 2008 2011 2013 and 2016 wickham et al 2014 these land cover maps are derived from landsat imagery at a spatial resolution of 30 m the classification scheme of the land cover in nlcd is modified from the anderson land cover classification system anderson 1976 the nlcd classification scheme has two levels and in total 20 subcategories open water surface in this system is coded as 11 wickham et al 2021 on the other hand the nlcd 1992 is downloaded from usgs sciencebase catalog https www sciencebase gov catalog item 5dfbcd38e4b0ff479b8c459f nlcd 1992 is the first generation of nlcd it is not included together with other nlcd land cover maps since the mapping method of nlcd 1992 is significantly different wickham et al 2014 however nlcd 1992 shares the same classification scheme and spatial resolution as other nlcd land cover maps the water surface is also coded as 11 in nlcd 1992 and it is comparable to the water surface category on other nlcd land cover maps according to available assessment results the classification accuracy of nlcd maps is adequate the user accuracy of open water class in this region is 97 for 1992 stehman et al 2003 94 for 2001 wickham et al 2010 94 for 2006 wickham et al 2013 86 89 for 2011 wickham et al 2017 and 92 99 for 2016 wickham et al 2021 respectively the hydrologic units hus at the level of 4 are collected from the usgs watershed boundary dataset wbd these supplementary data are used to delineate the boundary of the mobile river basin 3 methods in this study both lentic and lotic habitats are represented by the open water surface on the image the baseline lentic lotic habitat inventory is firstly delineated from 2019 sentinel 2 images at 10 m spatial resolution using liu s method liu et al 2021 the baseline lentic lotic habitat inventory is then used as a reference to retrospectively delineate the lentic habitats in the past 30 years from nlcd maps at 30 m spatial resolution the kernel density maps of lentic habitats are estimated to visualize the spatiotemporal evolution of the dense lentic habitats in the mobile river basin especially the blue lentic belt a tesseral model is then developed to structuralize the spatiotemporal evolution of the blue lentic belt into α peaks β slopes and γ edges finally critical attributes of these tesserae are numerically derived to quantify the spatiotemporal evolution of the blue lentic belt a flowchart that illustrates this workflow is shown in fig 2 3 1 the delineation of baseline lentic habitats the delineation of baseline lentic lotic habitats is a production from sentinel 2 imagery liu et al 2021 the iterative self organizing data analysis technique isodata unsupervised classification method dubes and jain 1976 tou and gonzalez 1974 is first used to identify the water surface pixels from sentinel 2 msi level 1c top of atmosphere toa reflectance image for better classification accuracy the isodata classification generates 12 to 15 clusters of spectrally homogeneous pixels the clusters of water surface pixels are visually interpreted and coded as 1 the other clusters are coded as 0 the region growing algorithm sonka et al 2014 is then implemented to form discrete aquatic habitat image objects to separate lentic habitat image objects from lotic habitat image objects the drainage network of the entire mobile river basin is employed as a reference if an aquatic habitat image object spatially intersects with the streamlines in the drainage network it will be determined as a lotic habitat image object otherwise the aquatic habitat image object will be determined as a lentic habitat image object the drainage network is hydrologically derived from the usgs ned using the d8 algorithm and flow accumulation o callaghan and mark 1984 the delineated drainage network has the same spatial resolution as the sentinel 2 imagery in this study 21 sentinel 2 image tiles were processed in the environment of envi 5 3 and idl 8 5 to fully cover the entire mobile river basin the outputs from all tiles were merged and dissolved into a single data file erroneous aquatic habitat image objects e g shadows were removed through inspection correspondingly 23 ned tiles were merged to hydrologically derive the drainage network of the entire mobile river basin using arcgis 10 5 the separated lotic and lentic habitat image objects were converted into two polygon shapefiles to achieve a reliable delineation of aquatic habitats the minimum mapping unit is set to 1 0 ha image objects smaller than the minimum mapping unit are considered unreliable and are removed because the sentinel 2 image tiles all are captured in the wet season of the mobile river basin in 2019 the baseline inventory then represents the maximum extent of the lentic lotic habitats in 2019 for a better reference the baseline inventory is hereafter named the 2019 inventory 3 2 retrospective delineation of past lentic habitats the nlcd maps are first used to retrospectively delineate the past aquatic habitats the first and second generations of nlcd maps share the same classification scheme which is modified from the anderson land use land cover classification system anderson 1976 in the nlcd classification scheme open water is coded as 11 wickham et al 2021 a binary reclassification is applied to the nlcd maps to separate the open water surface from other land covers the open water pixels code 11 on the nlcd maps are recoded as 1 and the other pixels are recoded as 0 since we use open water surfaces to represent aquatic habitats the nlcd binary reclassification results namely the nlcd open water masks well represent the past aquatic habitats and their representations are consistent with the 2019 inventory the delineated 2019 inventory of lentic lotic habitat image objects is then used as a reference to retrospectively delineate the past lentic habitats from nlcd open water masks the nlcd maps are classification products from landsat imagery at 30 m spatial resolution the coarse spatial resolution makes it impossible to delineate spatially adjacent lentic lotic habitats as individual image objects fig 3 and it is thus impossible to separate the lentic habitats from lotic habitats using the drainage network the alternative approach we developed is to use the lotic habitat image objects in the 2019 inventory as a reference to remove the past lotic habitats in the nlcd open water masks the nlcd open water masks are first converted into polygons in a vector format namely the nlcd open water polygons we assume that the lotic habitats in the mobile river basin had little change from the 1990s to the 2020s a visual examination of the nlcd maps indicates that this assumption is valid for the mobile river basin the past lentic habitats are derived from the nlcd open water polygons by erasing the lotic habitat polygons in the 2019 inventory since nlcd open water polygons are derived at a spatial resolution of 30 m but the 2019 inventory are derived at 10 m a 30 m buffer the nlcd pixel size is created for each lotic habitat polygon in the 2019 inventory to mitigate the edge displacement caused by the different spatial resolutions residuals smaller than the minimum mapping unit 1 0 ha after erasing are considered noise and are removed from nlcd 1992 to nlcd 2016 the past lentic habitats are delineated at each time node using the analysis tools in arcgis 10 5 the delineated inventories of past lentic habitats are named after the year numbers of the nlcd maps e g from the 1992 inventory to the 2016 inventory together with the 2019 inventory the spatiotemporal evolution of the lentic habitats in the mobile river basin is depicted at 9 discrete time nodes in the last 30 years 3 3 structuralize the spatiotemporal evolution of the blue lentic belt kernel density maps are used to represent the general spatial distribution pattern of the past lentic habitats in the mobile river basin and to show the spatiotemporal evolution of the blue lentic belt at each time node from 1992 to 2019 the lentic habitat image objects are converted into polygons in a vector format the centroid and the areal size of each polygon are numerically derived the kernel density estimation uses the centroid points of the lentic habitat image objects as their locations and the areal sizes of these lentic habitat image objects as the weights silverman 2018 the resulting kernel density map represents the proportion of open water surface to all the land cover types unit in ha per km2 in total 9 kernel density maps are estimated using arcgis 10 5 we further developed a spatial tesseral model based on sadahiro s surface similarity analysis sadahiro and masui 2004 to depict the structure in the spatiotemporal evolution of the lentic habitats in the mobile river basin especially along the blue lentic belt on each kernel density map a threshold d 0 6 ha per km2 is set to distinguish the dense lentic habitat zones from their adjacent background noise and a boundary is traced along with the location where the open water surface proportion equals the threshold d this optimal and universal threshold is determined through a trial and error strategy to maximize contrast between the dense lentic habitat areas and the background the spatially intersected and temporally adjacent regions of dense lentic habitats are sequentially stacked together to form a spatiotemporal object of the dense lentic habitats a spatiotemporal object of dense lentic habitats delineates the sub space time of the dense lentic habitats and shows the spatiotemporal evolution of the dense lentic habitats on the other hand a peak point is mounted to each local maximum open water surface proportion these peak points indicate the locations of the local densest lentic habitats the boundaries of the spatiotemporal objects and peak points within them at the 9 time nodes are projected onto a planar space to delineate the critical components in the spatiotemporal evolution of the lentic habitats three types of critical components are delineated from these boundaries and peak points α peaks β slopes and γ edges these are tesserae that spatially cover the region of interest an α peak is a minimum circle to include all spatiotemporally adjacent peak points a γ edge is a region bounded by the intersection of all inner most edges and the intersection of all outer most edges a β slope is the region outside the circle of α peaks but inside the inner edge of γ edges these three critical components indicate different characteristics in the spatiotemporal evolution of lentic habitats an α peak indicates the migration of the densest lentic habitats a small α peak indicates a stable region of concentrated lentic habitats while a large α peak indicates an apparent spatial migration of the densest lentic habitats a γ edge is the zonal change of the dense lentic habitats from or to the regions that have no dense lentic habitats it indicates either spatial expansion or shrinkage a β slope is a structurally stable component in the spatiotemporal evolution of the lentic habitats from the α peak to the γ edge the β slope shows the monotone gradient from dense lentic habitats to sparse lentic habitats with only changes in density values over time 3 4 derive essential attributes of the spatial tesserae multiple sorts of attributes are numerically derived from the α peaks β slopes and γ edges these attributes quantitatively describe the spatiotemporal evolution of the lentic habitats in the mobile river basin especially the blue lentic belt the centroids perimeters p α and radiuses r α of these α peaks are first numerically derived a small radius indicates a small α peak and a stable region of densest lentic habitats in contrast a large radius indicates a large α peak and an apparent spatial migration of densest lentic habitats secondly the inner perimeters p β i n the outer perimeters p β o u t and the area sizes a β of these β slopes are also numerically derived the range of the β slope r β is then defined as r β a β 1 2 p β i n p β o u t the range of the β slope r β indicates the extent of the structurally stable component in the spatiotemporal evolution of the dense lentic habitats finally the inner perimeters p γ i n the outer perimeters p γ o u t and the area sizes a γ of these γ edges are numerically derived the range of the γ edge r γ is then defined as r γ a γ 1 2 p γ i n p γ o u t the range of the γ edge r γ indicates the zonal changes of the dense lentic habitats a small r γ indicates little change in the spatial extent of dense lentic habitats over the study period but a large r γ indicates a broader change in the spatial extent of dense lentic habitats on the other hand the γ β range ratio is also calculated from the r γ divided by the average r β of the β slopes inside the γ edge the γ β range ratio indicates the stability of the spatiotemporal evolution a small ratio indicates a stable spatiotemporal object with insignificant zonal changes while a large ratio indicates a dynamic spatiotemporal object with apparent zonal changes 4 results and discussions 4 1 the delineation of the baseline and retrospective inventory of the lentic habitats the retrospective delineation method developed in this study has successfully removed the lotic habitats from open water masks the 2019 inventory of lentic habitats in the mobile river basin includes 18 483 isolated lentic habitat image objects the 2019 inventory has excluded 675 lotic habitat image objects the open water surface of delineated lentic habitats in the mobile river basin has an area of about 793 69 km2 while the open water surface of excluded lotic habitats has an area of about 1290 22 km2 the large area size of the excluded lotic habitat image objects indicates that it is necessary to exclude them while analyzing the spatial distribution of the lentic habitats otherwise the considerable area of lotic habitats may lead to the biased structure of the spatiotemporal evolution of the lentic habitats and erroneous conclusions using the 2019 inventory as a reference the developed retrospective delineation method enables the exclusion of the past lotic habitats in the mobile river basin and keeps only these past lentic habitats from nlcd 1992 to nlcd 2016 to our best knowledge the developed retrospective delineation method is the first method that enables us to analyze the spatiotemporal evolution of purely lentic habitats and the separate analyses of lentic and lotic habitats and their environmental impacts are hereafter feasible using gis rs approaches on a large spatiotemporal scope this approach is data driven and it can be applied to other regions if equivalent data are available the lentic habitats have been successfully delineated and separated from lotic habitats in the mobile river basin fig 3 two issues due to the multisource data may inevitably degrade the consistency of the analysis but the impacts are limited first the method to map the nlcd 1992 is claimed to be significantly different from the nlcd 2001 2016 maps wickham et al 2014 however the difference in map results is mainly in developed regions since open water surface has a strong spectral signature ngoc et al 2019 it is easy to achieve high classification accuracy for this single type of land cover regardless of supervised or unsupervised classification methods phiri et al 2020 hence for the study objective namely the aquatic habitats it is proper to assume that the 1992 inventory of lentic habitats is comparable to other nlcd based inventories secondly the nlcd based inventories are derived at the 30 m spatial resolution while the 2019 inventory is derived at the 10 m spatial resolution the adjacent but isolated lentic habitats on the 2019 inventory especially fishponds are fused into larger lentic habitats due to the coarse spatial resolution in the nlcd based inventories the coarse resolution leads to considerable underestimation in the total number of lentic habitats in the nlcd based inventories the area of each lentic habitat is thus employed to calculate the total area of lentic habitats rather than using the total number of lentic habitats the area of each lentic habitat is used as the weight while estimating the kernel density to mitigate the impacts from coarse spatial resolution and underestimated lentic habitat number the inventories of lentic habitats have high validity to analyze the spatiotemporal evolution of the lentic habitats in the mobile river basin especially the blue lentic belt the 2019 inventory has shown high spatial accuracy in location boundary and areal size liu et al 2021 erroneous and specious lentic habitats are removed through visual inspection on the other side the nlcd based inventories also have a high classification accuracy of open water surfaces see section 2 2 the high thematic accuracy of the inventories grounds the solid foundation for the spatiotemporal analysis of the lentic habitats in the mobile river basin moreover the 2019 inventory is derived from the sentinel 2 imagery obtained in the wet season of the mobile river basin an alternative tile of sentinel 2 image obtained in the dry season august in 2019 shows the ignorable seasonal changes of lentic habitats in the center of the blue lentic belt no lentic habitats disappeared or newly occurred between the wet and dry seasons in total 961 lentic habitats are investigated and the areal shrink is about 7 69 4 2 the spatiotemporal evolution of the blue lentic belt given the proposed tesseral model in this study the regions of dense lentic habitats are delineated at 9 time nodes in the past 30 years in the mobile river basin fig 4 the spatiotemporal evolution of the dense lentic habitats is then structuralized into three groups of tesserae fig 5 the largest tesserae overlay well with the blue lentic belt and they uncover the spatial expansion of the dense lentic habitats in the blue lentic belt since the 1990s the blue lentic belt tesserae have 4 α peaks 3 β slopes and a single γ edge they indicate that the dense lentic habitats in the blue lentic belt initially formed 4 hot spots and then these hot spots gradually merged into a single long belt two groups of tesserae are also discovered in the mobile river basin beside the blue lentic belt tesserae one group overlaps well with the city of birmingham al in the usa the other overlaps well with the confluence region of the tombigbee river and the alabama river these three groups of tesserae have different driving factors the blue lentic belt tesserae are driven by the inland farm raised catfish industry the birmingham tesserae are driven by the urban sprawl and the confluence tesserae is basically a natural spatiotemporal evolution of lentic habitats the quantitative attributes of each α peak β slope and γ edge are numerically derived respectively tables 1 2 and 3 the dense lentic habitats in the mobile river basin have a relatively stable central tendency indicated by the small values of r α the largest r α is about 6 49 km which means the maximum migration of densest lentic habitats is within 13 km 2 r α the α peaks in the blue lentic belt show two patterns in central tendency the α 1 and α 2 have the most stable aggregation of lentic habitats over time their r α values are less than 2 km in contrast the α 3 and α 4 have a comparatively less stable aggregation of lentic habitats over time indicated by larger values of r α the blue lentic belt has the largest structurally stable components in the spatiotemporal evolution of the lentic habitats it has three β slopes and they have a total area size of 16 310 15 km2 and an average range of 27 21 km the γ β range ratio of the blue lentic belt tesserae is 0 57 and it shows a moderate magnitude of spatial expansion in comparison the γ β range ratio of the birmingham tesserae is 3 00 and the γ β range ratio of the confluence tesserae is 0 25 these results indicate that the anthropogenic activities e g the urban sprawl may cause a large magnitude of changes in lentic habitats while the natural process in the change of lentic habitats is slow the spatiotemporal evolution of the lentic habitats in the blue lentic belt is in the middle it is slow but considerable the tesseral model successfully visualizes and quantifies the spatial expansion of the blue lentic belt and it also can be applied to other geographic phenomena that locally expand or shrink the delineation of α peaks β slopes and γ edges is variable according to the density threshold d a small d cannot efficiently remove noisy and erroneous spatial objects of dense lentic habitats consequentially the derived tesserae will be unnecessarily complicated on the contrary a large d can only depict the regions of densest lentic habitats which are oversimplified spatial objects to represent the spatiotemporal evolution of the lentic habitats in the mobile river basin the density threshold d is set to 0 6 ha per km2 in this study and it successfully depicts the expansion of the dense lentic habitats in the mobile river basin in the last 30 years especially the blue lentic belt a slight change in the d is going to result in a slight difference in the shape of the delineated tesserae and their quantitative attributes however the slightly changed tesserae can also successfully represent the spatiotemporal evolution of the dense lentic habitats and they will still lead to the same conclusions in this study 4 3 the development of the farm raised catfish industry and their environmental impacts the farm raised catfish industry is considered the primary driving force of the spatiotemporal evolution of lentic habitats in the blue lentic belt the reported open water surface area sizes of catfish ponds in alabama are collected from the united states department of agriculture usda https usda library cornell edu concern publications bg257f046 locale en release items these area sizes are reported by usda every july from 1988 to 2020 and they are used to represent the development of the farm raised catfish industry in the mobile river basin these usda reports also include the open water surface area sizes of catfish ponds in mississippi however mississippi has two regions of dense lentic habitats and farm raised catfish hargreaves and tucker 2004 schrader and dennis 2005 namely the west larger region and the east smaller region the mobile river basin contains only the smaller east region of mississippi the joined statistics of catfish ponds in mississippi cannot represent the evolution of the lentic habitats in the mobile river basin and they are excluded the open water surface area sizes of catfish ponds in alabama and the lentic habitat area sizes derived in this study are together plotted against time fig 6 the plot is then used to interpret the evolution of the blue lentic belt in the mobile river basin an apparent coincidental trend is observable in the temporal evolution of the lentic habitats in the mobile river basin and the development of the farm raised catfish industry fig 6 the general trend of the farm raised catfish industry in alabama is a unimodal wave in the last 30 years the wave peaked in 2004 with an increasing phase from 1988 to 2004 and a declining phase from 2004 to 2017 the increasing phase of the farm raised catfish industry is consistent with the increase of the lentic habitat open water surface area from 1992 to 2004 indicated by the linear yellow trend line since 2004 the farm raised catfish industry has been shrinking indicated by the linear red trend line however the areal shrinkage of the farm raised catfish industry was particularly due to the abandonment of catfish ponds these abandoned catfish ponds were not refilled as land but were kept as wild lentic habitats this explains the stationary phase of the lentic habitats in the mobile river basin from 2004 to 2016 indicated by the linear blue line the 2019 inventory indicates a further slight increase of lentic habitat open water surface area in the mobile river basin this recent increase on one side may be caused by the recent mild booming of the farm raised catfish industry from 2016 to 2020 on the other side the 2019 inventory is derived from sentinel 2 imagery with a high spatial resolution during the wet season and it represents the maximal extent of the lentic habitats in the mobile river basin the estimation from the maximal extent of the lentic habitats may exaggerate the increase in 2019 however the single point estimation in 2009 will not mislead the general trend in the stationary phase of the lentic habitats in the mobile river basin another thing to notice is that the magnitude of increase in the lentic habitats in the mobile river basin is significantly different from that in catfish pond open water surface this disparity is because of two primary reasons first the dense catfish ponds in the east of mississippi about ten counties are excluded from the statistics since no data are available secondly many artificial ponds were not included in the statistics of the farm raised catfish industry they may be already abandoned before they are used as catfish ponds hence only the trend is used in this study to analyze the correspondence between the spatiotemporal evolution of the lentic habitats in the mobile river basin and the development of the farm raised catfish industry as indicated by the spatiotemporal analysis in this study the blue lentic belt was artificially formed from 4 hotspots of densest lentic habitats in the mobile river basin in the past 30 years the spatial expansion of the dense lentic habitats is considerable and numerous artificial ponds are made along with the development of the farm raised catfish industry in alabama and mississippi a critical concern on the recently formed blue lentic belt is the possible negative impacts on its water quality and aquatic ecosystems first continuous input of feed materials into the fishpond is necessary to raise the catfish this process is an intensive import of nutrients e g nitrogen n and phosphorus p into the lentic habitats numerous studies have emphasized that the overloaded nutrients in the aquatic habitats will increase the risk of eutrophication and harmful algae blooms habs boyd 2017 carmichael and boyer 2016 paerl et al 2020 wurtsbaugh et al 2019 on the other side the blue lentic belt is spatially overlapped with the black prairie belt which has a much longer history of agriculture in the mobile river basin barone 2005 the lentic habitats in the blue lentic belt are tightly enclosed by the agricultural land of the black prairie belt it has been indicated that agricultural land constitutes about one third of the adjacent land cover to the lentic habitats in the blue lentic belt which is much higher than that to the lotic habitats in the mobile river basin liu et al 2021 the intensive agricultural activities further elevate the risks to water quality in these lentic habitats besides extra nutrients imposed by the chemical fertilizers these lentic habitats are also easy to concentrate direct toxicants imposed by pesticides anderson et al 2013 furthermore the environmental impacts are not constrained within the blue lentic belt the two main rivers namely the tombigbee river and the alabama river go through the blue lentic belt the ejected effluents may release the water with concentrated nutrients and toxicants into the lotic habitats the contaminated water then may degrade the water quality of the downstream aquatic habitats endanger the municipal water in downstream counties and increase the risks to aquatic ecosystems in mobile bay and the gulf of mexico however since the blue lentic belt is newly discovered limited studies and discussions are available on this environmental concern this concern calls for attention and is open for more intensive investigations 5 conclusions this study developed a retrospective delineation model and a tesseral model to visualize the spatiotemporal evolution of the blue lentic belt in the mobile river basin in the last 30 years sentinel 2 multispectral remote sensing data are first used to delineate the baseline inventory of lentic habitats in the mobile river basin and to separate the lotic habitats from lentic habitats the land cover maps from nlcd are then used to delineate the past lentic habitats in the mobile river basin kernel density maps of the lentic habitats are estimated to extract the regions of dense lentic habitats which sequentially form the spatiotemporal objects of the dense lentic habitats in the mobile river basin the spatiotemporal objects are projected onto a planar space and are then structuralized as groups of spatial tesserae namely the α peaks β slopes and γ edges the attributes of these spatial tesserae are numerically derived to quantitatively describe the spatiotemporal evolution of the dense lentic habitats in the mobile river basin especially the blue lentic belt the spatiotemporal evolution of the lentic habitats in the mobile river basin is structuralized as three groups of spatial tesserae and the group to represent the blue lentic belt is the dominant one the spatial tesserae of the blue lentic belt include 4 α peaks 3 β slopes and a single γ edge the blue lentic belt is formed from 4 stable hotspots α peaks of the densest lentic habitats the γ β range ratio on the blue lentic belt tesserae is 0 57 the ratio indicates that the spatial expansion γ edge of the blue lentic belt is considerable compared to its stationary monotone regions β slopes the booming of the farm raised catfish industry is considered the main driving force of the spatiotemporal expansion of the blue lentic belt since they share the same trend the booming of the farmed raised catfish industry and the spatiotemporal expansion of the blue lentic belt in the mobile river basin impose increasing stress on the local and downstream aquatic habitats these negative impacts on aquatic habitats need more attention and systematic investigations from the cooperation of multiple disciplines the spatiotemporal evolution of the blue lentic belt is successfully depicted using the retrospective delineation method and the tesseral model developed in this study remote sensing data with high spatial resolution e g the sentinel 2 imagery enable the separation of the lotic and lentic habitats and the retrospective delineation of purely lentic or lotic habitats on a large basin scale respectively the retrospective delineation method is also appliable to the lentic or lotic habitats in other basins and on a broader scope the developed tesseral model is also appliable and transferable to other natural and

16061,coastal wetlands are an important source of methane emissions and understanding the mechanisms that control methane emissions from coastal wetlands is of great significance to global warming anaerobic oxidation of methane driven by sulfate is an important process to prevent methane emissions from coastal wetlands the effects of environmental changes on this process and the function of the sulfate methane transition zone smtz are poorly understood in this study spatiotemporal variations in pore water geochemistry concentrations of so4 2 ch4 and dic as well as δ13c dic and δ13c ch4 in the beidagang wetland tianjin china were investigated to unravel factors controlling the role of anaerobic oxidation of methane in coastal wetlands results show that the geochemical profile of pore water is characterized by significant spatial and temporal variability which may be related to changes in sulfate concentration temperature and dissolved oxygen the carbon isotope fractionation factors ε c during methane oxidation range from 8 9 to 12 5 indicating that the sulfate driven anaerobic oxidation of methane s aom dominates the methane oxidation in the beidagang coastal wetland in both winter and summer in both high and low salinity wetlands and in both open water and littoral areas however sulfate concentration has a strong influence on the sulfate reduction pathways and methane consumption the consumption of methane and sulfate by s aom is more significant in coastal wetlands with high sulfate concentrations with s aom consuming nearly all of the upward diffusing methane 96 and downward diffusing sulfate 96 in addition the dissolved inorganic carbon dic produced in the pore water mainly comes from methanogenesis accounting for more than 80 of the total dic pool but in the areas with high sulfate concentrations in water column the contribution of s aom to the dic pool is greater although only a small fraction of the total dic pool 9 the depth and width of the smtz show a clear spatial and temporal pattern with active methanogenesis activity and upward high methane flux shoaling the smtz and increasing the risk of high methane emissions from coastal wetlands with low sulfate concentrations our findings highlight the importance of sulfate driven anaerobic oxidation of methane in coastal wetlands and the effect of sulfate concentration on it it contributes to our understanding of the mechanism of methane production and emissions from the coastal wetland system particularly in light of the increased demand for coastal wetland restoration

methane ch4 is an important greenhouse gas that plays a critical role in climate change with a global warming potential of 28 34 times greater than that of co2 on a hundred year time scale myhre et al 2013 stocker 2014 methane has contributed 20 to global warming since the industrial revolution beaulieu et al 2019 according to recent model estimates global methane emissions from 2008 to 2017 were 737 tg ch4 yr 1 with over 40 of these emissions being from natural sources saunois et al 2020 natural wetlands are the largest natural source hamdan and wickland 2016 accounting for nearly 1 3 of global methane emissions bridgham et al 2013 coastal wetlands cover only about 0 3 of the earth s surface mcowen et al 2017 pendleton et al 2012 but contribute 7 to 30 of annual global methane emissions segarra et al 2013 marine environments make up 70 of the earth s surface but contribute only 1 2 of global methane emissions wallenius et al 2021 weber et al 2019 of which a significant proportion up to 75 comes from coastal and estuarine environments hamdan and wickland 2016 wallenius et al 2021 microbial processes regulate the production and consumption of methane in the natural environment knittel and boetius 2009 since a large amount of ch4 is produced in anoxic sediments through methanogenesis knittel and boetius 2009 and has a huge potential impact on climate change archer 2007 the importance of anaerobic oxidation of methane aom as an effective global methane sink against methane escape to the atmosphere from sediments has been widely recognized for decades barnes and goldberg 1976 dale et al 2008 egger et al 2015 he et al 2019 hensen et al 2003 hinrichs and boetius 2002 knittel and boetius 2009 regnier et al 2011 segarra et al 2015 in marine sediments methane is oxidized anaerobically by a consortium of anaerobic methanotrophic anme archaea and sulfate reducing bacteria boetius et al 2000 orphan et al 2001 with sulfate as the terminal electron acceptor boetius et al 2000 hoehler et al 1994 this process is commonly referred to as sulfate driven anaerobic oxidation of methane or sulfate dependent anaerobic oxidation of methane s aom which consumes both sulfate and methane according to the reaction barnes and goldberg 1976 1 c h 4 so 4 2 h s hco 3 h 2 o in surface sediments sulfate consumption can also be driven by organic matter that escapes degradation berelson et al 2005 komada et al 2016 and is referred to as organoclastic sulfate reduction osr jørgensen 1977 1982 2 2 c h 2 o so 4 2 h 2 s 2 hco 3 the s aom process consumes 90 of the methane produced in marine sediments knittel and boetius 2009 and 70 of the sulfate diffused into marine sediments akam et al 2020 egger et al 2018 it is generally accepted that s aom occurs in sulfate rich environments whereas s aom appears to be less important in sediments with lower sulfate concentrations wallenius et al 2021 in sulfate poor environment when sulfate is restricted aom is likely to be mediated by other energetically more favorable electron acceptors such as fe iii mn iv egger et al 2015 segarra et al 2013 sivan et al 2011 nitrate and nitrite he et al 2016 2019 raghoebarsing et al 2006 segarra et al 2013 shen et al 2016 wang et al 2019 however the rates of iron dependent anaerobic oxidation of methane fe aom were recorded at less than 5 of the methane oxidation rates wallenius et al 2021 and 3 of the total methane removal egger et al 2015 which is significantly lower than that of s aom in coastal marine and brackish surface sediments significant rates of nitrate nitrite dependent anaerobic oxidation of methane n aom were observed mainly in sediments with high nitrate and nitrite concentrations he et al 2019 wang et al 2019 in addition s aom contributes 40 of the dissolved inorganic carbon dic produced in marine sediments pore water akam et al 2020 the outflow of produced pore water dic into the water column has a significant impact on surface water chemistry and potentially atmospheric co2 akam et al 2020 previous studies have shown that the contribution of s aom to the pore water dic pool is greatest in the ocean akam et al 2020 sauer et al 2015 ranging from 50 to 80 feng et al 2019 liu et al 2020 while the contribution of s aom in estuaries is less than 20 wu et al 2016 in freshwater lakes the contribution of s aom to the pore water dic pool is also high ranging from 50 to 70 kleint et al 2021 the zone where s aom process occurs is referred to as the sulfate methane transition zone smtz and is often defined as the depth interval where non zero sulfate and methane overlap barnes and goldberg 1976 d hondt et al 2002 in addition to numerous reports in marine environments e g egger et al 2018 and reference therein smtz has been reported in brackish sediments and low sulfate environments cao et al 2021 egger et al 2015 kleint et al 2021 sawicka and brüchert 2017 weber et al 2016 wu et al 2015 2016 the smtz functions as an effective methane barrier minimizing methane release to the atmosphere kleint et al 2021 knittel and boetius 2009 the efficiency of s aom affects the efflux of methane boetius and wenzhöfer 2013 sommer et al 2006 and the surviving methane that bypasses the smtz may undergo other pathways of aom and aerobic methane oxidation mox or enter the overlying water column eventually escaping to the atmosphere egger et al 2016 he et al 2019 rasigraf et al 2017 wallenius et al 2021 in addition it has been highlighted that the smtz not only serves as a methane sink but is an important diagenetic front for the dic cycle with authigenic carbonate precipitated within the smtz comparable to 15 of carbonate accumulation in the ocean akam et al 2020 the latest compilation reported the smtz to be 2 m in inner shelf sediments and suggested that smtz depths increase with water depth egger et al 2018 studies of marginal seas and estuaries have found that the smtz depths became significantly shallower with decreasing sulfate concentrations cao et al 2021 myllykangas et al 2020 which may be due to the low sulfate flux into the sediment in low sulfate concentration environment wu et al 2015 the shoaling of the smtz may also explain high methane emissions from coastal systems hamdan and wickland 2016 wallenius et al 2021 coastal wetlands are critical transition zones between land and sea that play an important role in mitigating global climate change breithaupt et al 2012 ouyang and lee 2014 and are known as blue carbon ecosystems mcleod et al 2011 pendleton et al 2012 coastal wetlands have high carbon burial rates chmura et al 2003 duarte et al 2005 houghton 2007 but the effective accumulation of carbon in coastal wetlands does not result in high methane emissions callaway et al 2012 chmura et al 2003 connor et al 2001 holm et al 2016 ouyang and lee 2014 this may reflect the large amount of sulfate carried by seawater gupta et al 2013 poffenbarger et al 2011 which suggests that ch4 is likely to be consumed within the smtz via s aom in coastal wetlands indeed the average contribution of s aom to total anaerobic methane oxidation was found to be as high as 34 5 in the inter tidal zone wang et al 2019 in coastal brackish wetlands aom was shown to be more dependent on sulfate reduction segarra et al 2013 in coastal freshwater wetlands it has also been suggested that s aom may contribute substantially to anaerobic consumption of methane segarra et al 2015 although studies have shown that sulfate has a significant impact on methane emissions from coastal wetlands the consumption of methane by s aom in coastal wetlands has not been accurately quantified and the contribution of s aom processes to the sediment dic pool remains unknown moreover the effects of environmental changes e g changes in salinity and sulfate concentration caused by natural factors and anthropogenic intervention on s aom processes and methane budgets remain unclear wallenius et al 2021 especially for the ecological restoration of degraded coastal wetlands erkens et al 2016 kroeger et al 2017 lee et al 2006 and the impact of restoration measures on the global methane budget for example impoundment and freshening result in enhanced methane emissions kroeger et al 2017 methane emissions from coastal wetlands were significantly elevated during flooding events gatland et al 2014 and increased methane emissions were also observed in low salinity portions of tidally restricted wetlands helton et al 2014 kroeger et al 2017 in contrast sulfate derived from agricultural pollution and saltwater intrusion may suppress methane emissions helton et al 2014 recent studies have shown that significant ch4 and co2 reductions from salt marshes can be achieved by restoring disconnected saline tidal flows kroeger et al 2017 understanding the mechanism controlling methane emissions from coastal wetlands is of great significance to global carbon neutrality programs and global warming mitigation suir et al 2019 wang et al 2021 the objectives of this study are to investigate 1 the contribution of s aom to methane consumption and dic production in coastal wetlands and 2 the impacts of sulfate concentration on the methane budgets in coastal wetlands to achieve these purposes seasonal sampling was conducted in a coastal wetland with large salinity differences influenced by anthropogenic water delivery investigations were carried out at four sites over two seasons to capture the temporal and spatial variability of chemical conditions in sediments and their influence on methane oxidation we hypothesize that 1 s aom dominates methane consumption in coastal wetland sediments 2 the contribution of s aom to methane and sulfate consumption and dic production varies spatially and temporally depending on environmental variations temperature salinity and sulfate concentration and 3 in areas with lower sulfate concentrations s aom contributes less to methane and sulfate consumption and dic production and shoals the smtz weakening the barrier function of the smtz 2 materials and methods 2 1 study region this study was conducted

calculation can be found in the supporting information 3 results 3 1 variations in temperature salinity dissolved oxygen and ph of surface and bottom water the temperature of the bottom water was close to that of the surface water at each site varying between 26 4 c and 32 6 c in summer table 1 while water temperature in winter ranged from 2 7 c to 12 4 c in winter the salinity of the water at all sites was higher than that in summer the salinity of water in the br site was the lowest and the salinity of water in the bt and bte sites had the highest salinity close to that of bohai seawater

concentrations were higher in winter than in summer with the highest values in the bg site and the lowest values occurring in the bt and bte sites the do concentrations in the bottom water were lower than the surface water at all sites in summer while the do concentrations in the bottom water and the surface water were almost identical in winter and values were similar at all sites 10 9 mg l 1 to

concentrations in summer although sulfate concentrations in the overlying water varied between the sampling sites 2 94 mmol l 1 at the brs site 5 36 mmol l 1 at the bgs site 19 42 mmol l 1 at the bts site and 20 63 mmol l 1 at the btes site sulfate concentrations all decreased sharply to near 0 in the surface sediments and then showed a downward increasing trend at the bottom fig 2 except at the btes site where sulfate concentrations dropped relatively slowly from the surface to the deeper sediments fig 2d the sulfate profile pattern at the brw bgw and btw sites in winter is significantly different from that in summer fig 3 with sulfate concentrations in the upper sediments remaining constant 6 mmol l 1 between 0 and 8 cm depth at the brw site 9 mmol l 1 between 0 and 10 cm depth at the bgw site and 30 mmol l 1 between 0 and 4 cm at the btw site and then decreasing downwards gently and not being completely depleted at the deepest position where the pore water stops collecting the pattern of the methane concentration profiles was opposite to that of the sulfate concentration profiles figs 2 and 3 in summer the bottom sediments methane concentrations increased with depth upwards and reached maximum 1 70 mmol l 1 at 8 cm depth at the brs site 0 85 mmol l 1 at 8 cm depth at the bgs site 0 85 mmol l 1 at 16 cm depth at the bts site and then decreased sharply upwards at the top sediment except for the btes site where the maximum was at the bottom of the sediment 1 00 mmol l 1 at 29 cm depth and decreased with depth upwards fig 2d methane concentrations of the overlying water at the brs bgs bts and btes sites were 0 22 mmol l 1 0 04 mmol l 1 0 03 mmol l 1 and 0 04 mmol l 1 respectively in winter methane concentrations at the brw and btw sites increased from the bottom upwards reaching a maximum of 2 24 mmol l 1 and 0 66 mmol l 1 at 30 cm depth respectively and then decreased upwards to a value less than 0 01 mmol l 1 at depth of 3 cm and 0 cm respectively methane concentrations at the bgw site decreased upwards from bottom to a value less than 0 01 mmol l 1 at depth of 10 cm methane concentrations of the overlying water at the brw bgw and btw sites were 0 42 μmol l 1 0 31 μmol l 1 and 2 89 μmol l 1 respectively which were much lower than those in summer pore water profiles of sulfate and methane showed the smtz depth of 2 5 cm 3 cm 3 5 cm 15 cm 20 cm 21 cm and 15 cm for brs bgs bts btes brw bgw and btw respectively extending along with the depth where sulfate and methane coexist in the br and bg sites the concentration profiles of dissolved ca2 were clearly different from those of dissolved mg2 figs 2 and 3 generally ca2 concentrations showed a downward decreasing trend within the smtz and then increased while mg2 concentrations continued to increase with depth bgw is slightly different with ca2 concentrations increasing and mg2 concentrations decreasing downwards within the smtz in bt and bte both ca2 and mg2 concentrations decreased within the smtz it can be found that significant authigenic carbonate precipitation process occurred within the smtz at all sites as has been observed in ocean environments akam et al 2020 the dic concentration profiles showed downward increase at all sites but decrease in the deepest sediments at the brs and bts site at the bts and btes sites the dic peaks appeared in the smtz 22 82 mmol l 1 at the bts site and 26 20 mmol l 1 at the btes site similar to previous studies in the ocean e g hu et al 2017 knab et al 2008 in winter the dic concentrations were almost constant 5 mmol l 1 at the brw site 8 mmol l 1 at the bgw site and 9 mmol l 1 at the btw site at the top of the sediments and then increased downwards 3 3 variations in carbon isotopic composition of dic and ch4 the δ13c dic values at the brs bgs bts and btes sites decreased from 15 01 8 37 6 24 and 8 94 in the bottom water to minimum values of 16 48 at 2 cm 14 20 at 3 cm 11 98 at 1 cm and 11 82 at 19 cm respectively with these minimum values being within the smtz fig 2 however the δ13c dic was inverted below the smtz and dic became δ13c enriched with increasing depth especially at the brs site where this trend was particularly pronounced in winter the δ13c dic values in the bottom water were 5 15 3 94 0 87 at the brw bgw and btw sites respectively which were heavier than in summer and the δ13c dic decreased downwards the δ13c ch4 profiles showed a consistent pattern with the δ13c ch4 values increasing upwards above the smtz slightly in summer and sharply in winter and increased downwards below the smtz figs 2 and 3 the minimum values of δ13c ch4 were at the bottom of the smtz 4 discussion 4 1 spatiotemporal variations of pore water profile patterns the depth of the redox zone in sediments is affected by water temperature oxygen salinity and or the composition and rate of input of organic matter wallenius et al 2021 furthermore it has been shown that the concentration gradients of the oxidants for organic carbon mineralization do not remain constant over time crill and martens 1987 dale et al 2008 glud et al 2003 rather seasonal variations affect the rates of reduction processes in sediments in summer the linear and sharp decay of sulfate concentration and the relatively shallow smtz in pore water fig 2 suggest that the surface sediments are anoxic antler et al 2014 hu et al 2015 wu et al 2015 and do may be rapidly depleted below the sediment water interface a previous study found that do is depleted within 6 mm below the sediment water interface in salt marsh ponds in summer koop jakobsen and gutbrod 2019 the sulfate reduction zone was immediately adjacent to the sediment water interface and the methanogenesis zone was located below the sulfate reduction zone the upwards decrease of methane concentrations in surface sediments suggests the presence of a methane oxidation zone that overlaps with the sulfate reduction zone hypoxia in sediments is a common phenomenon in summer e g egger et al 2016 in addition to the effects of temperature blooms of phytoplankton in spring and summer lead to high organic carbon input and oxygen demand middelburg and levin 2009 sawicka and brüchert 2017 resulting in lower do concentrations in bottom waters table 1 enhanced hypoxia alters biogeochemical processes and shoals the redox zone in sediments middelburg and levin 2009 stressing anaerobic pathways of organic matter degradation hartnett and devol 2003 middelburg and levin 2009 including methanogenesis maltby et al 2018 myllykangas et al 2020 resulting in increased methane flux and water column methane concentrations in summer fig 2 and table s2 e g egger et al 2016 gelesh et al 2016 kleint et al 2021 moreover larger sulfate concentration gradients were observed at high bottom water sulfate concentrations fig 2c suggesting that the level of sulfate concentration also has an important effect on the sulfate reduction rate the opposite was true in winter the sulfate reduction zone methane oxidation zone methanogenesis zone and sulfate methane transition zone all shifted downwards compared to summer and the associated biogeochemical rates decreased exhibiting reduced concentration gradients in addition the sulfate concentrations at the sediment surface remained constant over some depth in winter which is consistent with the observation of sawicka and brüchert 2017 do concentrations in water column were higher in winter than in summer table 1 e g sawicka and brüchert 2017 increased do concentration in the water column and decreased organic carbon input and reduced microbial activity lead to deeper sulfate penetration and broader oxidation zones pimenov et al 2013 bioturbation may also be an important influence that can facilitate oxygen penetration to greater depths antler et al 2019 myllykangas et al 2020 leading to kink type sulfate profiles fig 3 hensen et al 2003 it is important to note that the pore water profile pattern in the littoral site btes fig 2d also differs from the other sites in summer possibly due to loose sediments and plant roots supporting oxygen transport to the surface sediments chowdhury and dick 2013 hanson and hanson 1996 whalen 2005 making the surface sediments low oxygen zones bastviken et al 2004 a previous study suggested that oxygen dynamics in pond swamp habitats differ from those of surrounding vegetated marshes koop jakobsen and gutbrod 2019 in the littoral zone oxygen penetration can reach a depth of 6 cm in summer which is 10 times deeper than in pond swamp habitats koop jakobsen and gutbrod 2019 4 2 production and consumption of methane in the sediments the stable carbon isotopic composition of methane in sediments is less susceptible to anthropogenic influences and thus provides more reliable constraints on methane production and oxidation regnier et al 2011 geochemical profiles of methane in the beidagang wetland sediments in summer and winter figs 2 and 3 clearly demonstrate the deep source of methane and the consumption of methane in surface sediments in this section we identify methane sources and consumption pathways through concentration and isotope evidence 4 2 1 sources of methane in the sediments although methane in wetlands is generally considered to be biogenic the sources of methane in the sediments of beidagang wetland still require careful consideration given the presence and potential influence of adjacent oil fields methanogenesis strongly fractionates carbon isotopes with the methane produced being significantly depleted in 13c relative to the substrate conrad 2005 whiticar 1999 the carbon isotopic composition δ13c ch4 of biogenic methane typically ranges from 110 to 50 whiticar 1999 whiticar and faber 1986 while that of thermogenic methane is usually typically enriched in 13c ranging from 50 to 20 schoell 1988 whiticar 1999 in the beidagang wetland the carbon isotope values δ13c ch4 of methane below the smtz ranged from 50 4 to 83 2 figs 2 and 3 indicating a biogenic source therefore the increase of δ13c ch4 with depth below the smtz most likely reflects in situ microbial methane production rather than the addition of heavy methane from deep sources burdige et al 2016 sauer et al 2015 in addition we obtained kinetic isotope fractionation factors for carbon ε c 1 0 fig 4 c from the rayleigh distillation function below the smtz alperin et al 1988 crowe et al 2011 egger et al 2015 rayleigh 1896 in contrast to the kinetic isotopic fractionation factors within and above the smtz which may be relevant to microbial methanogenesis chanton et al 2005 egger et al 2015 hornibrook et al 2000 whiticar 1999 in the methanogenesis zones below the smtz carbon dioxide and acetate are used as substrates for methanogenesis in the absence of sulfate claypool and kaplan 1974 martens and berner 1974 the nearly parallel profiles of δ13c ch4 and δ13c dic with increasing depth heuer et al 2009 below the smtz suggest that methane is likely produced through co2 reduction whiticar 1999 the exact process requires more evidence and needs to be studied in the future it should be noted that fluctuations in deep methane concentration profiles may be caused by uneven distribution of gas pockets or degassing during sub sampling dickens et al 1997 paull and ussler iii 2001 however in the mixing and net reaction plots of ch4 fig s6 all points below the smtz were linearly correlated r2 0 99 indicating that methane is not affected by degassing during sampling komada et al 2016 4 2 2 the oxidation of methane in the sediments the δ13c ch4 values within and above the smtz showed an upwards increase figs 2 and 3 which is consistent with methane carbon isotope fractionation related to methane oxidation alperin et al 1988 conrad 2005 whiticar 1999 light isotopes are preferentially oxidized during methane oxidation alperin et al 1988 martens et al 1999 whiticar 1999 resulting in a gradual enrichment of the residual ch4 in 13c ch4 toward cores surface egger et al 2015 the rayleigh distillation function plots fig 4 show two or three distinct sets of carbon isotope fractionation factors ε c above the smtz in summer btes and winter all sites the isotope fractionation factors ε c ranged from 2 0 to 2 7 which are comparable to the fractionation factor ε c 2 derived from the high cell density methane aerobic oxidation experiments reported by templeton et al 2006 considering that the sulfate concentrations remained constant over those depths and that the slightly sustained decrease in methane concentrations was accompanied by a gradual increase in δ13c ch4 in surface sediments the aerobic oxidation of methane mox may have occurred above the smtz at these sites aerobic methane oxidizing bacteria mob are expected to dominate the surface sediment rasigraf et al 2017 studies from lacustrine and terrestrial environments suggest that mob may be less sensitive to temperature king 1992 wik et al 2014 and more adaptable to cold environments this explains our observation that δ13c ch4 could increase to 29 5 in winter fig 3b which is consistent with the findings in lake willersinnweiher that mox causes an increase in δ13c ch4 from 75 in the bottom water to 24 in the middle water einzmann 2020 in brackish coastal sediments aerobic methanotrophs at the surface of the sediment have also been found to consume a large fraction of methane not oxidized by the aom process mcdonald et al 2005 moussard et al 2009 steinle et al 2017 the depleted δ13c dic hotspots treude et al 2014 within the smtz fig 2 are likely the result of carbon isotope fractionation during aom hinrichs et al 1999 adding light carbon from methane to the dic pool chen et al 2010 haese et al 2003 yoshinaga et al 2014 the minimum values of δ13c dic ranged from 18 49 to 11 82 larger than those observed in marine sediments cf komada et al 2016 wehrmann et al 2011 wurgaft et al 2019 but consistent with coastal environments cf 19 and 12 sauer et al 2015 where they are thought to be the result of s aom the rayleigh distillation function plots fig 4 reveal a common range of carbon isotope fractionation factors ε c 8 9 to 12 5 which corresponds with the reported boundary 7 3 13 of carbon isotope fractionation factors associated with s aom in marine sediment alperin et al 1988 egger et al 2015 holler et al 2009 martens et al 1999 this result is consistent with the sharp decrease in sulfate concentration within the smtz figs 2 and 3 indicating that s aom is the main methane anaerobic oxidation process within the smtz and may even dominate the methane consumption process in the beidagang wetland both in high and low sulfate environments the carbon isotope fractionation factors below the smtz at the bgs and brs sites remain in the same sense as within the smtz fig 4 suggesting that aom still exists below the smtz at the bgs and brs sites aom may also be present below the smtz at the bts site affecting the carbon isotope fractionation process and disturbing the carbon isotope fractionation factor during methanogenesis at the bgs site aom tends to couple sulfate reduction at low sulfate concentration previous studies have shown that s aom can occur at low sulfate concentration much less than 1 mmol l 1 e g beal et al 2011 segarra et al 2015 weber et al 2017 2016 perhaps supported by a cryptic sulfur cycle holmkvist et al 2011 however at the brs site the carbon isotope fractionation factors below the smtz in summer and winter are as low as 4 3 which may be a result of the carbon isotope partitioning behavior during methanogenesis blurring the kinetic isotopic effects of carbon during the cryptic sulfur cycle another possibility is that this value is related to fe aom which has been found to play an important role in methane removal in freshwater crowe et al 2011 norði et al 2013 sivan et al 2011 wersin et al 1991 and brackish water egger et al 2015 segarra et al 2013 slomp et al 2013 environments the high active iron contents in br 3 mg g sun et al unpublished may support this hypothesis but requires more conclusive evidence in addition the downward increase in sulfate concentration at the bottom of the sediment may be an inheritance from earlier saltwater relics koebsch et al 2019 or a conseqence upwelling of deeper groundwater which further promotes anaerobic oxidation of methane in the deep sediment mogollón et al 2012 the nitrate concentrations 8 μmol l 1 of the bottom water in this study are much lower than the values minimum value is 71 4 μmol l 1 reported by he et al 2019 suggesting that n aom may not be important in the beidagang wetland 4 2 3 the contribution of s aom to sulfate reduction and methane oxidation both s aom and osr coexisting within the smtz burdige and komada 2011 komada et al 2016 consume sulfate and produce dic through sulfate reduction processes in the beidagang wetland linear sulfate profiles within the smtz fig 2 suggest that s aom may dominate the consumption of sulfate within the smtz borowski et al 1996 chuang et al 2013 hensen et al 2003 luo et al 2013 mazumdar et al 2014 niewöhner et al 1998 wallmann et al 2006 the ratio of cation adjusted dic δdic δca2 δmg2 to removed sulfate δso4 2 is often used to assess the occurrence of osr and s aom within the smtz antler et al 2014 burdige and komada 2011 chen et al 2010 haese et al 2003 hu et al 2015 liu et al 2020 luo et al 2013 peketi et al 2015 wu et al 2016 we expected a ratio of 1 1 for aom and 2 1 for osr according to the net stoichiometry of eqs 1 and 2 and found that almost all data for br and bg summer and winter within the smtz plotted along the 2 1 ratio line fig 5 which appears to indicate that osr is the main sulfate consumption process within the smtz for both br and bg the distribution of data for bt was close to the 1 1 ratio line in summer bts and between the 2 1 and 1 1 lines in winter btw suggesting that s aom removed sulfate within the smtz in summer while osr and aom coexist in winter this is consistent with the conclusions of wu et al 2015 data from the btes site also suggest that s aom and osr coexist within the smtz it should be noted that this approach is not always reliable as dic from deep sources can cause data to fall above the 2 1 line fig 5 chatterjee et al 2011 wu et al 2016 while significant authigenic carbonate precipitation in saline water with high concentrations of ca2 can drive data below the 1 1 line fig 5 liu et al 2020 to understand better the sulfate reduction pathways within the smtz and to quantify the role of s aom in sulfate reduction diffusion flux calculations across the smtz were performed see supporting information the calculation results are listed in table s2 for the brs bgs bts and btes sites the ratios of net dic produced by s aom and osr to total sulfate fluxes were 1 63 1 38 1 03 and 1 48 respectively the estimates of 1 51 1 89 and 1 62 for brw bgw btw sites in winter were greater than those in summer this result is consistent with the findings in fig 5 the sulfate fluxes diffusing into the smtz in the sediments of the open water area sediments br bg and bt were 30 75 50 74 mmol m 2 d 1 in summer and 0 52 3 07 mmol m 2 d 1 in winter for the littoral zone btes the summer flux value was 7 59 mmol m 2 d 1 according to the net dic fluxes we calculated that 37 03 96 41 of the sulfate diffusing into the smtz was reduced by s aom in summer fig 6 while the contribution of s aom to sulfate consumption f s aom within the smtz decreased in winter with the estimated range being 11 53 47 27 the variation of doc concentrations within the smtz fig s2 and s3 also supported our calculation results especially at the bgs site where doc consumption within the smtz was much higher than accumulation indicating that osr accounts for the major consumption of sulfate this is a wide range compared to the reported values for estuarine sediments cf sawicka and brüchert 2017 continental shelf cf wurgaft et al 2019 deep sea basins cf hong et al 2016 komada et al 2016 and cold seeps cf feng et al 2019 liu et al 2020 wehrmann et al 2011 further the f s aom was greater at sites with high sulfate concentrations with almost all of the sulfate 96 41 being used to consume methane at the bts site however at the btes site the sulfate concentration was the same as at bts site but s aom consumed only half of the methane within the smtz the low oxygen status of the surface sediments may inhibit strictly s aom anaerobic processes and microorganisms associated with aom were found to be viable at relatively high temperatures zehnder and brock 1980 which may also be responsible for the pathway alteration in winter on a regional scale the highest f s aom was observed in the sulfate rich ocean environment while the highest f osr was observed in an estuarine environment fig 6b probably due to the flowing river water facilitating the exchange of dissolved oxygen in the surface pore water with the overlying water consistent with the reason for the lower f s aom at btes site the calculated methane fluxes consumed by s aom in summer were 18 79 mmol m 2 d 1 19 17 mmol m 2 d 1 44 81 mmol m 2 d 1 and 3 89 mmol m 2 d 1 at brs bgs bts and btes sites respectively the estimated consumption values for brw bgw and btw sites in winter were 0 26 mmol m 2 d 1 0 06 mmol m 2 d 1 and 1 17 mmol m 2 d 1 the contribution of s aom to methane oxidation can reach 71 01 89 28 95 91 and 83 30 at brs bgs bts and btes sites in summer respectively methane oxidation decreases in winter to 22 03 46 15 and 85 40 at brw bgw and btw sites respectively the contribution of s aom to methane consumption in this study is close to previous estimates for the marine environment 90 knittel and boetius 2009 previous studies have found that s aom efficiency in the marine environment appears to be related to the rate of upward flow of sulfate depleted fluids with increased s aom efficiency at lower fluid velocity niemann et al 2006 wallmann et al 2006 xu et al 2018 2021 in some environments with very low fluid flow rates where methane rarely escapes to the bottom water steeb et al 2015 xu et al 2018 the contribution of s aom to methane consumption can be up to 98 100 knab et al 2008 xu et al 2021 the low porosity fig s4 high methane flux table s2 and sufficient sulfate in the bottom water can support high s aom efficiency at our study sites overall our results based on the calculation of diffusive fluxes demonstrate that s aom dominates methane oxidation in the beidagang wetland and make an important contribution to methane removal in both high and low sulfate concentration wetlands however the higher the sulfate concentration in the surface water of the wetland the more efficiently methane was removed 4 3 possible sources of pore water dic the concentration and stable carbon isotopic composition of pore water dic are sensitive indicators to characterize carbon cycle processes wu et al 2016 the increase of dic concentration and decrease of δ13c dic in sediment surface fig 2 are correlated with osr and s aom burdige et al 2016 komada et al 2016 wehrmann et al 2011 while the increase of δ13c dic with depth below the smtz fig 2 is related to methanogenesis by either co2 reduction or acetate fermentation conrad 2005 whiticar 1999 therefore the high concentration of dic within the smtz is a mixture of in situ light dic produced by osr and aom within the smtz and heavy dic produced by methanogenesis below the smtz chatterjee et al 2011 to estimate the relative contributions of osr s aom and methanogenesis to the dic pool in summer we applied a simple three end member mixing model komada et al 2016 wu et al 2016 5 δ 13 c added f osr δ 13 c om f s aom δ 13 c s aom f methanogenesis δ 13 c dic 6 f osr f s aom f methanogenesis 1 where f is the fraction of dic produced from osr s aom and methanogenesis the meaning of the different δ and the details of the calculation process can be found in the supporting information the final calculation results are presented in table s3 methanogenesis is the largest source of the pore water dic pool ranging from 82 56 to 88 7 while osr 0 64 8 68 and s aom 2 55 8 58 contribute relatively little to the pore water dic pool the high contribution of methanogenesis to the dic pool may influence the dic concentration within the smtz resulting in a ratio of cation adjusted dic to removed sulfate higher than 2 1 fig 5 furthermore the role of aom and methanogenesis is more important in areas of high sulfate concentration in the beidagang wetland bts and btes on a regional scale the contribution of s aom to pore water dic pool increases and the contribution of methanogenesis decreases from coastal wetlands to marine sediments fig 7 the increasing trend of methane contribution to the dic pool from marine sediments to coastal wetlands is consistent with the trend from the abyss to the inner shelf akam et al 2020 and this trend may be related to the increasing organic carbon burial rate per unit area from ocean to coastal wetlands 2 62 g c m 2 yr 1 for shelf waters 13 10 g c m 2 yr 1 for estuarine waters and 98 72 g c m 2 yr 1 for tidal wetlands najjar et al 2018 coastal wetlands have high carbon storage accounting for 50 of ocean carbon sequestration duarte et al 2013 2005 high organic carbon burial rates and high organic carbon sequestration can provide methanogens with sufficient substrate for methanogenesis egger et al 2018 which may explain such a high contribution of methanogenesis to pore water dic pool in coastal wetlands fig 7 in addition we found that the contribution of s aom to pore water dic is higher at sites with high sulfate concentrations both in the beidagang wetland and on a regional scale 4 4 the variation of the smtz depth and its controlling factors the depth of the smtz in the beidagang wetland 10 cm on average is similar to other wetlands 10 cm ng et al 2017 segarra et al 2015 2013 but shallower than that of estuarine sediments cf sawicka and brüchert 2017 wu et al 2015 and marine sediments cf egger et al 2018 and reference therein in addition significant seasonal fluctuations in the depth of the smtz were found with shallower depths near the sediment water interface in summer and moving down to deeper depths in winter similar observations were found in other studies with the smtz deeper in winter than in summer e g kleint et al 2021 maltby et al 2018 myllykangas et al 2020 sawicka and brüchert 2017 wu et al 2015 in summer elevated temperatures and high organic matter input and hypoxia due to biomass blooms middelburg and levin 2009 increase so4 2 reduction and methanogenesis rates which may lead to vertical upwards migration of smtz in sediments egger et al 2016 2015 slomp et al 2013 spatially the depth of the smtz was significantly deeper than that of open water in the littoral areas of reeds growth which may be the result of oxygen influence wehrmann et al 2011 in addition there was little variation in smtz depths in open water areas and the smtz was deeper in areas with higher bottom water sulfate concentrations which is consistent with studies in coastal marine sediments cf cao et al 2021 myllykangas et al 2020 wu et al 2015 wu et al 2015 suggested that high sulfate concentration increases the sulfate flux into the sediments and affects the depth of the smtz however a strong correlation between the depth of the smtz and bottom water sulfate concentration was not observed on a regional scale fig 8 a implying that sulfate concentration may not be a direct cause of smtz depth variation myllykangas et al 2020 a strong negative correlation between the smtz depth downward sulfate flux and upward methane flux was observed on a regional scale fig 8b c which is consistent with the global ocean sediment data of egger et al 2018 many studies have suggested that the depth of the smtz is related to the upward methane flux e g burdige and komada 2011 myllykangas et al 2020 sauer et al 2015 and that high upward methane flux will shoal the smtz borowski et al 1996 hong et al 2016 liu et al 2020 sauer et al 2015 zhang et al 2020 for example the smtz depth is typically greater than 100 cm in marine sediments while the depth of smtz in cold seeps is only a few centimeters e g fischer et al 2012 gieskes et al 2005 which may be due to the high upward methane flux in cold seeps activated methanogenesis directly affects the sulfate kinetics through aom mogollón et al 2012 as the upward diffusion flux of methane increases the activity of aom is enhanced hong et al 2016 liu et al 2020 regnier et al 2011 leading to an increased demand for sulfate which explains the strong positive correlation between downward sulfate flux and upward methane flux fig 7d high methane concentrations and high upward methane fluxes were observed in organic matter rich regions mogollón et al 2012 sawicka and brüchert 2017 zhang et al 2020 suggesting that organic matter input may be a key factor influencing the relationship between methane fluxes and smtz depth borowski et al 1996 myllykangas et al 2020 high organic matter input rates and sedimentation rates will shorten the residence time of organic matter in the sulfate reduction zone increase the methanogenic substrate below the smtz dale et al 2019 sundby 2006 promote methane production increase the upward methane flux egger et al 2016 2018 and further shoal the smtz depth weaken the filtering function of the smtz and result in more methane entering the water column and even escaping to the atmosphere gelesh et al 2016 on a regional scale the upward methane fluxes increase from marine sediments to estuarine sediments and yet further to coastal wetlands sediments by every 2 to 3 orders of magnitude fig 8 egger et al 2018 also found methane diffusive fluxes to the smtz from coastal systems up to three orders of magnitude higher compared to methanogenic deep sea sediments and suggested that this flux increase correlates with changes in sediment age at the smtz the high upward methane flux in coastal wetlands may be associated with the high carbon burial rate chmura et al 2003 duarte et al 2005 houghton 2007 this would imply that the relative contribution of methanogenesis to organic matter degradation becomes more important mogollón et al 2012 which is consistent with the relative contribution of methanogenesis to pore water dic increasing from marine environments to coastal wetlands fig 7 although we have no direct evidence that methane consumption by s aom decreased from ocean to coastal wetlands as methane within the smtz is usually assumed to be completely consumed by sulfate in flux calculations e g wu et al 2016 the contribution of s aom to the pore water dic pool decreased from ocean to coastal wetlands fig 7 which indirectly suggests a decrease in the contribution of s aom to methane consumption therefore the shoaled smtz impairs s aom and increases the potential for methane emission myllykangas et al 2020 wallenius et al 2021 the contribution of s aom to methane consumption is greater in areas with high bottom water sulfate concentrations fig 9 suggesting that bottom water sulfate concentration also has an important effect on s aom high bottom water sulfate concentrations mean that there is enough sulfate in the smtz to support methane oxidation and that sulfate can be replenished quickly and adequately the reaction of sulfate with easily available methane can support thriving microbial growth however in the areas with low sulfate concentrations there is little sulfate remaining to support methane oxidation after the osr process thus sulfate is not available to penetrate deeper to react with methane and microorganisms may have adapted to using organic matter rather than methane as a substrate for growth during their long term evolution 5 conclusions geochemical profiles patterns of sediments in the beidagang wetland tianjin china show significant temporal and spatial variability our results show that despite aerobic oxidation of methane methane consumption is mainly dominated by s aom in the beidagang wetland it consumes 71 01 95 91 of methane within the smtz and 37 03 96 41 of sulfate is consumed meanwhile within the smtz in winter this contribution become lower due to changes in dissolved oxygen and temperature in particular s aom consumes more sulfate within the smtz in areas with high bottom water sulfate concentrations while more sulfate is used for osr within the smtz in areas with low bottom water sulfate concentrations in addition methanogenesis is the largest source of the pore water dic pool with a range of 82 56 88 7 while osr 0 64 8 68 and s aom 2 55 8 58 contribute less to the pore water dic pool similarly methanogenesis and s aom contribute more to the pore water dic pool in areas with high sulfate concentrations in the bottom water in addition the smtz depths in the beidagang wetland sediments were shallower than those in estuarine and marine sediments and there were significant seasonal variations which may be caused by changes in temperature oxygen and organic matter inputs the depth of the smtz is strongly negatively correlated with the upward methane flux and the downward sulfate flux the large amount of organic carbon buried in the coastal wetlands triggers active methanogenesis leading to high upward methane fluxes that shoal the smtz resulting in high methane emissions from the coastal wetlands desalinization of coastal wetland waters caused by human intervention will reduce the supply of sulfate from the water column to the sediment weakening the s aom and impairing the barrier function of the smtz further inducing high methane emissions in coastal wetlands declaration of competing interest the authors

16061,coastal wetlands are an important source of methane emissions and understanding the mechanisms that control methane emissions from coastal wetlands is of great significance to global warming anaerobic oxidation of methane driven by sulfate is an important process to prevent methane emissions from coastal wetlands the effects of environmental changes on this process and the function of the sulfate methane transition zone smtz are poorly understood in this study spatiotemporal variations in pore water geochemistry concentrations of so4 2 ch4 and dic as well as δ13c dic and δ13c ch4 in the beidagang wetland tianjin china were investigated to unravel factors controlling the role of anaerobic oxidation of methane in coastal wetlands results show that the geochemical profile of pore water is characterized by significant spatial and temporal variability which may be related to changes in sulfate concentration temperature and dissolved oxygen the carbon isotope fractionation factors ε c during methane oxidation range from 8 9 to 12 5 indicating that the sulfate driven anaerobic oxidation of methane s aom dominates the methane oxidation in the beidagang coastal wetland in both winter and summer in both high and low salinity wetlands and in both open water and littoral areas however sulfate concentration has a strong influence on the sulfate reduction pathways and methane consumption the consumption of methane and sulfate by s aom is more significant in coastal wetlands with high sulfate concentrations with s aom consuming nearly all of the upward diffusing methane 96 and downward diffusing sulfate 96 in addition the dissolved inorganic carbon dic produced in the pore water mainly comes from methanogenesis accounting for more than 80 of the total dic pool but in the areas with high sulfate concentrations in water column the contribution of s aom to the dic pool is greater although only a small fraction of the total dic pool 9 the depth and width of the smtz show a clear spatial and temporal pattern with active methanogenesis activity and upward high methane flux shoaling the smtz and increasing the risk of high methane emissions from coastal wetlands with low sulfate concentrations our findings highlight the importance of sulfate driven anaerobic oxidation of methane in coastal wetlands and the effect of sulfate concentration on it it contributes to our understanding of the mechanism of methane production and emissions from the coastal wetland system particularly in light of the increased demand for coastal wetland restoration

methane ch4 is an important greenhouse gas that plays a critical role in climate change with a global warming potential of 28 34 times greater than that of co2 on a hundred year time scale myhre et al 2013 stocker 2014 methane has contributed 20 to global warming since the industrial revolution beaulieu et al 2019 according to recent model estimates global methane emissions from 2008 to 2017 were 737 tg ch4 yr 1 with over 40 of these emissions being from natural sources saunois et al 2020 natural wetlands are the largest natural source hamdan and wickland 2016 accounting for nearly 1 3 of global methane emissions bridgham et al 2013 coastal wetlands cover only about 0 3 of the earth s surface mcowen et al 2017 pendleton et al 2012 but contribute 7 to 30 of annual global methane emissions segarra et al 2013 marine environments make up 70 of the earth s surface but contribute only 1 2 of global methane emissions wallenius et al 2021 weber et al 2019 of which a significant proportion up to 75 comes from coastal and estuarine environments hamdan and wickland 2016 wallenius et al 2021 microbial processes regulate the production and consumption of methane in the natural environment knittel and boetius 2009 since a large amount of ch4 is produced in anoxic sediments through methanogenesis knittel and boetius 2009 and has a huge potential impact on climate change archer 2007 the importance of anaerobic oxidation of methane aom as an effective global methane sink against methane escape to the atmosphere from sediments has been widely recognized for decades barnes and goldberg 1976 dale et al 2008 egger et al 2015 he et al 2019 hensen et al 2003 hinrichs and boetius 2002 knittel and boetius 2009 regnier et al 2011 segarra et al 2015 in marine sediments methane is oxidized anaerobically by a consortium of anaerobic methanotrophic anme archaea and sulfate reducing bacteria boetius et al 2000 orphan et al 2001 with sulfate as the terminal electron acceptor boetius et al 2000 hoehler et al 1994 this process is commonly referred to as sulfate driven anaerobic oxidation of methane or sulfate dependent anaerobic oxidation of methane s aom which consumes both sulfate and methane according to the reaction barnes and goldberg 1976 1 c h 4 so 4 2 h s hco 3 h 2 o in surface sediments sulfate consumption can also be driven by organic matter that escapes degradation berelson et al 2005 komada et al 2016 and is referred to as organoclastic sulfate reduction osr jørgensen 1977 1982 2 2 c h 2 o so 4 2 h 2 s 2 hco 3 the s aom process consumes 90 of the methane produced in marine sediments knittel and boetius 2009 and 70 of the sulfate diffused into marine sediments akam et al 2020 egger et al 2018 it is generally accepted that s aom occurs in sulfate rich environments whereas s aom appears to be less important in sediments with lower sulfate concentrations wallenius et al 2021 in sulfate poor environment when sulfate is restricted aom is likely to be mediated by other energetically more favorable electron acceptors such as fe iii mn iv egger et al 2015 segarra et al 2013 sivan et al 2011 nitrate and nitrite he et al 2016 2019 raghoebarsing et al 2006 segarra et al 2013 shen et al 2016 wang et al 2019 however the rates of iron dependent anaerobic oxidation of methane fe aom were recorded at less than 5 of the methane oxidation rates wallenius et al 2021 and 3 of the total methane removal egger et al 2015 which is significantly lower than that of s aom in coastal marine and brackish surface sediments significant rates of nitrate nitrite dependent anaerobic oxidation of methane n aom were observed mainly in sediments with high nitrate and nitrite concentrations he et al 2019 wang et al 2019 in addition s aom contributes 40 of the dissolved inorganic carbon dic produced in marine sediments pore water akam et al 2020 the outflow of produced pore water dic into the water column has a significant impact on surface water chemistry and potentially atmospheric co2 akam et al 2020 previous studies have shown that the contribution of s aom to the pore water dic pool is greatest in the ocean akam et al 2020 sauer et al 2015 ranging from 50 to 80 feng et al 2019 liu et al 2020 while the contribution of s aom in estuaries is less than 20 wu et al 2016 in freshwater lakes the contribution of s aom to the pore water dic pool is also high ranging from 50 to 70 kleint et al 2021 the zone where s aom process occurs is referred to as the sulfate methane transition zone smtz and is often defined as the depth interval where non zero sulfate and methane overlap barnes and goldberg 1976 d hondt et al 2002 in addition to numerous reports in marine environments e g egger et al 2018 and reference therein smtz has been reported in brackish sediments and low sulfate environments cao et al 2021 egger et al 2015 kleint et al 2021 sawicka and brüchert 2017 weber et al 2016 wu et al 2015 2016 the smtz functions as an effective methane barrier minimizing methane release to the atmosphere kleint et al 2021 knittel and boetius 2009 the efficiency of s aom affects the efflux of methane boetius and wenzhöfer 2013 sommer et al 2006 and the surviving methane that bypasses the smtz may undergo other pathways of aom and aerobic methane oxidation mox or enter the overlying water column eventually escaping to the atmosphere egger et al 2016 he et al 2019 rasigraf et al 2017 wallenius et al 2021 in addition it has been highlighted that the smtz not only serves as a methane sink but is an important diagenetic front for the dic cycle with authigenic carbonate precipitated within the smtz comparable to 15 of carbonate accumulation in the ocean akam et al 2020 the latest compilation reported the smtz to be 2 m in inner shelf sediments and suggested that smtz depths increase with water depth egger et al 2018 studies of marginal seas and estuaries have found that the smtz depths became significantly shallower with decreasing sulfate concentrations cao et al 2021 myllykangas et al 2020 which may be due to the low sulfate flux into the sediment in low sulfate concentration environment wu et al 2015 the shoaling of the smtz may also explain high methane emissions from coastal systems hamdan and wickland 2016 wallenius et al 2021 coastal wetlands are critical transition zones between land and sea that play an important role in mitigating global climate change breithaupt et al 2012 ouyang and lee 2014 and are known as blue carbon ecosystems mcleod et al 2011 pendleton et al 2012 coastal wetlands have high carbon burial rates chmura et al 2003 duarte et al 2005 houghton 2007 but the effective accumulation of carbon in coastal wetlands does not result in high methane emissions callaway et al 2012 chmura et al 2003 connor et al 2001 holm et al 2016 ouyang and lee 2014 this may reflect the large amount of sulfate carried by seawater gupta et al 2013 poffenbarger et al 2011 which suggests that ch4 is likely to be consumed within the smtz via s aom in coastal wetlands indeed the average contribution of s aom to total anaerobic methane oxidation was found to be as high as 34 5 in the inter tidal zone wang et al 2019 in coastal brackish wetlands aom was shown to be more dependent on sulfate reduction segarra et al 2013 in coastal freshwater wetlands it has also been suggested that s aom may contribute substantially to anaerobic consumption of methane segarra et al 2015 although studies have shown that sulfate has a significant impact on methane emissions from coastal wetlands the consumption of methane by s aom in coastal wetlands has not been accurately quantified and the contribution of s aom processes to the sediment dic pool remains unknown moreover the effects of environmental changes e g changes in salinity and sulfate concentration caused by natural factors and anthropogenic intervention on s aom processes and methane budgets remain unclear wallenius et al 2021 especially for the ecological restoration of degraded coastal wetlands erkens et al 2016 kroeger et al 2017 lee et al 2006 and the impact of restoration measures on the global methane budget for example impoundment and freshening result in enhanced methane emissions kroeger et al 2017 methane emissions from coastal wetlands were significantly elevated during flooding events gatland et al 2014 and increased methane emissions were also observed in low salinity portions of tidally restricted wetlands helton et al 2014 kroeger et al 2017 in contrast sulfate derived from agricultural pollution and saltwater intrusion may suppress methane emissions helton et al 2014 recent studies have shown that significant ch4 and co2 reductions from salt marshes can be achieved by restoring disconnected saline tidal flows kroeger et al 2017 understanding the mechanism controlling methane emissions from coastal wetlands is of great significance to global carbon neutrality programs and global warming mitigation suir et al 2019 wang et al 2021 the objectives of this study are to investigate 1 the contribution of s aom to methane consumption and dic production in coastal wetlands and 2 the impacts of sulfate concentration on the methane budgets in coastal wetlands to achieve these purposes seasonal sampling was conducted in a coastal wetland with large salinity differences influenced by anthropogenic water delivery investigations were carried out at four sites over two seasons to capture the temporal and spatial variability of chemical conditions in sediments and their influence on methane oxidation we hypothesize that 1 s aom dominates methane consumption in coastal wetland sediments 2 the contribution of s aom to methane and sulfate consumption and dic production varies spatially and temporally depending on environmental variations temperature salinity and sulfate concentration and 3 in areas with lower sulfate concentrations s aom contributes less to methane and sulfate consumption and dic production and shoals the smtz weakening the barrier function of the smtz 2 materials and methods 2 1 study region this study was conducted

into the headspace over an equilibration phase of at least 15 h weber et al 2017 dic concentrations and δ13c dic were measured by a gas source isotopic ratio mass spectrometer gs irms equipped with gas bench intake thermo delta v with gas bench ii using nbs 18 calcite as standard the concentration of dic was determined according to the peak height and calibration curve on the gs irms with an

referred to the d 0 values of 25 c and 10 c in infinitely diluted solutions reported by boudreau 1997 for the low salinity sites br and bg in summer august and winter february in this study respectively and the d 0 values of 25 c and 10 c in seawater reported by schulz 2006 for the high salinity sites bt and bte in summer august and winter february respectively details of the flux calculation can be found in the supporting information 3 results 3 1 variations in temperature salinity dissolved oxygen and ph of surface and bottom water the temperature of the bottom water was close to that of the surface water at each site varying between 26 4 c and 32 6 c in summer table 1 while water temperature in winter ranged from 2 7 c to 12 4 c in winter the salinity of the water at all sites was higher than that in summer the salinity of water in the br site was the lowest and the salinity of water in the bt and bte sites had the highest salinity close to that of bohai seawater 30 the variations of salinity and sulfate concentration in surface water in different areas of the wetland are spatially consistent with the sampling sites fig s1 the dissolved oxygen do concentrations were higher in winter than in summer with the highest values in the bg site and the lowest values occurring in the bt and bte sites the do concentrations in the bottom water were lower than the surface water at all sites in summer while the do concentrations in the bottom water and the surface water were almost identical in winter and values were similar at all sites 10 9 mg l 1 to 13 3 mg l 1 table 1 the ph values of the surface water and the bottom water were similar in summer and winter at all sites range from 8 2 to 8 7 3 2 variations in sulfate ch4 ca2 mg2 and dic concentrations in summer although sulfate concentrations in the overlying water varied between the sampling sites 2 94 mmol l 1 at the brs site 5 36 mmol l 1 at the bgs site 19 42 mmol l 1 at the bts site and 20 63 mmol l 1 at the btes site sulfate concentrations all decreased sharply to near 0 in the surface sediments and then showed a downward increasing trend at the bottom fig 2 except at the btes site where sulfate concentrations dropped relatively slowly from the surface to the deeper sediments fig 2d the sulfate profile pattern at the brw bgw and btw sites in winter is significantly different from that in summer fig 3 with sulfate concentrations in the upper sediments remaining constant 6 mmol l 1 between 0 and 8 cm depth at the brw site 9 mmol l 1 between 0 and 10 cm depth at the bgw site and 30 mmol l 1 between 0 and 4 cm at the btw site and then decreasing downwards gently and not being completely depleted at the deepest position where the pore water stops collecting the pattern of the methane concentration profiles was opposite to that of the sulfate concentration profiles figs 2 and 3 in summer the bottom sediments methane concentrations increased with depth upwards and reached maximum 1 70 mmol l 1 at 8 cm depth at the brs site 0 85 mmol l 1 at 8 cm depth at the bgs site 0 85 mmol l 1 at 16 cm depth at the bts site and then decreased sharply upwards at the top sediment except for the btes site where the maximum was at the bottom of the sediment 1 00 mmol l 1 at 29 cm depth and decreased with depth upwards fig 2d methane concentrations of the overlying water at the brs bgs bts and btes sites were 0 22 mmol l 1 0 04 mmol l 1 0 03 mmol l 1 and 0 04 mmol l 1 respectively in winter methane concentrations at the brw and btw sites increased from the bottom upwards reaching a maximum of 2 24 mmol l 1 and 0 66 mmol l 1 at 30 cm depth respectively and then decreased upwards to a value less than 0 01 mmol l 1 at depth of 3 cm and 0 cm respectively methane concentrations at the bgw site decreased upwards from bottom to a value less than 0 01 mmol l 1 at depth of 10 cm methane concentrations of the overlying water at the brw bgw and btw sites were 0 42 μmol l 1 0 31 μmol l 1 and 2 89 μmol l 1 respectively which were much lower than those in summer pore water profiles of sulfate and methane showed the smtz depth of 2 5 cm 3 cm 3 5 cm 15 cm 20 cm 21 cm and 15 cm for brs bgs bts btes brw bgw and btw respectively extending along with the depth where sulfate and methane coexist in the br and bg sites the concentration profiles of dissolved ca2 were clearly different from those of dissolved mg2 figs 2 and 3 generally ca2 concentrations showed a downward decreasing trend within the smtz and then increased while mg2 concentrations continued to increase with depth bgw is slightly different with ca2 concentrations increasing and mg2 concentrations decreasing downwards within the smtz in bt and bte both ca2 and mg2 concentrations decreased within the smtz it can be found that significant authigenic carbonate precipitation process occurred within the smtz at all sites as has been observed in ocean environments akam et al 2020 the dic concentration profiles showed downward increase at all sites but decrease in the deepest sediments at the brs and bts site at the bts and btes sites the dic peaks appeared in the smtz 22 82 mmol l 1 at the bts site and 26 20 mmol l 1 at the btes site similar to previous studies in the ocean e g hu et al 2017 knab et al 2008 in winter the dic concentrations were almost constant 5 mmol l 1 at the brw site 8 mmol l 1 at the bgw site and 9 mmol l 1 at the btw site at the top of the sediments and then increased downwards 3 3 variations in carbon isotopic composition of dic and ch4 the δ13c dic values at the brs bgs bts and btes sites decreased from 15 01 8 37 6 24 and 8 94 in the bottom water to minimum values of 16 48 at 2 cm 14 20 at 3 cm 11 98 at 1 cm and 11 82 at 19 cm respectively with these minimum values being within the smtz fig 2 however the δ13c dic was inverted below the smtz and dic became δ13c enriched with increasing depth especially at the brs site where this trend was particularly pronounced in winter the δ13c dic values in the bottom water were 5 15 3 94 0 87 at the brw bgw and btw sites respectively which were heavier than in summer and the δ13c dic decreased downwards the δ13c ch4 profiles showed a consistent pattern with the δ13c ch4 values increasing upwards above the smtz slightly in summer and sharply in winter and increased downwards below the smtz figs 2 and 3 the minimum values of δ13c ch4 were at the bottom of the smtz 4 discussion 4 1 spatiotemporal variations of pore water profile patterns the depth of the redox zone in sediments is affected by water temperature oxygen salinity and or the composition and rate of input of organic matter wallenius et al 2021 furthermore it has been shown that the concentration gradients of the oxidants for organic carbon mineralization do not remain constant over time crill and martens 1987 dale et al 2008 glud et al 2003 rather seasonal variations affect the rates of reduction processes in sediments in summer the linear and sharp decay of sulfate concentration and the relatively shallow smtz in pore water fig 2 suggest that the surface sediments are anoxic antler et al 2014 hu et al 2015 wu et al 2015 and do may be rapidly depleted below the sediment water interface a previous study found that do is depleted within 6 mm below the sediment water interface in salt marsh ponds in summer koop jakobsen and gutbrod 2019 the sulfate reduction zone was immediately adjacent to the sediment water interface and the methanogenesis zone was located below the sulfate reduction zone the upwards decrease of methane concentrations in surface sediments suggests the presence of a methane oxidation zone that overlaps with the sulfate reduction zone hypoxia in sediments is a common phenomenon in summer e g egger et al 2016 in addition to the effects of temperature blooms of phytoplankton in spring and summer lead to high organic carbon input and oxygen demand middelburg and levin 2009 sawicka and brüchert 2017 resulting in lower do concentrations in bottom waters table 1 enhanced hypoxia alters biogeochemical processes and shoals the redox zone in sediments middelburg and levin 2009 stressing anaerobic pathways of organic matter degradation hartnett and devol 2003 middelburg and levin 2009 including methanogenesis maltby et al 2018 myllykangas et al 2020 resulting in increased methane flux and water column methane concentrations in summer fig 2 and table s2 e g egger et al 2016 gelesh et al 2016 kleint et al 2021 moreover larger sulfate concentration gradients were observed at high bottom water sulfate concentrations fig 2c suggesting that the level of sulfate concentration also has an important effect on the sulfate reduction rate the opposite was true in winter the sulfate reduction zone methane oxidation zone methanogenesis zone and sulfate methane transition zone all shifted downwards compared to summer and the associated biogeochemical rates decreased exhibiting reduced concentration gradients in addition the sulfate concentrations at the sediment surface remained constant over some depth in winter which is consistent with the observation of sawicka and brüchert 2017 do concentrations in water column were higher in winter than in summer table 1 e g sawicka and brüchert 2017 increased do concentration in the water column and decreased organic carbon input and reduced microbial activity lead to deeper sulfate penetration and broader oxidation zones pimenov et al 2013 bioturbation may also be an important influence that can facilitate oxygen penetration to greater depths antler et al 2019 myllykangas et al 2020 leading to kink type sulfate profiles fig 3 hensen et al 2003 it is important to note that the pore water profile pattern in the littoral site btes fig 2d also differs from the other sites in summer possibly due to loose sediments and plant roots supporting oxygen transport to the surface sediments chowdhury and dick 2013 hanson and hanson 1996 whalen 2005 making the surface sediments low oxygen zones bastviken et al 2004 a previous study suggested that oxygen dynamics in pond swamp habitats differ from those of surrounding vegetated marshes koop jakobsen and gutbrod 2019 in the littoral zone oxygen penetration can reach a depth of 6 cm in summer which is 10 times deeper than in pond swamp habitats koop jakobsen and gutbrod 2019 4 2 production and consumption of methane in the sediments the stable carbon isotopic composition of methane in sediments is less susceptible to anthropogenic influences and thus provides more reliable constraints on methane production and oxidation regnier et al 2011 geochemical profiles of methane in the beidagang wetland sediments in summer and winter figs 2 and 3 clearly demonstrate the deep source of methane and the consumption of methane in surface sediments in this section we identify methane sources and consumption pathways through concentration and isotope evidence 4 2 1 sources of methane in the sediments although methane in wetlands is generally considered to be biogenic the sources of methane in the sediments of beidagang wetland still require careful consideration given the presence and potential influence of adjacent oil fields methanogenesis strongly fractionates carbon isotopes with the methane produced being significantly depleted in 13c relative to the substrate conrad 2005 whiticar 1999 the carbon isotopic composition δ13c ch4 of biogenic methane typically ranges from 110 to 50 whiticar 1999 whiticar and faber 1986 while that of thermogenic methane is usually typically enriched in 13c ranging from 50 to 20 schoell 1988 whiticar 1999 in the beidagang wetland the carbon isotope values δ13c ch4 of methane below the smtz ranged from 50 4 to 83 2 figs 2 and 3 indicating a biogenic source therefore the increase of δ13c ch4 with depth below the smtz most likely reflects in situ microbial methane production rather than the addition of heavy methane from deep sources burdige et al 2016 sauer et al 2015 in addition we obtained kinetic isotope fractionation factors for carbon ε c 1 0 fig 4 c from the rayleigh distillation function below the smtz alperin et al 1988 crowe et al 2011 egger et al 2015 rayleigh 1896 in contrast to the kinetic isotopic fractionation factors within and above the smtz which may be relevant to microbial methanogenesis chanton et al 2005 egger et al 2015 hornibrook et al 2000 whiticar 1999 in the methanogenesis zones below the smtz carbon dioxide and acetate are used as substrates for methanogenesis in the absence of sulfate claypool and kaplan 1974 martens and berner 1974 the nearly parallel profiles of δ13c ch4 and δ13c dic with increasing depth heuer et al 2009 below the smtz suggest that methane is likely produced through co2 reduction whiticar 1999 the exact process requires more evidence and needs to be studied in the future it should be noted that fluctuations in deep methane concentration profiles may be caused by uneven distribution of gas pockets or degassing during sub sampling dickens et al 1997 paull and ussler iii 2001 however in the mixing and net reaction plots of ch4 fig s6 all points below the smtz were linearly correlated r2 0 99 indicating that methane is not affected by degassing during sampling komada et al 2016 4 2 2 the oxidation of methane in the sediments the δ13c ch4 values within and above the smtz showed an upwards increase figs 2 and 3 which is consistent with methane carbon isotope fractionation related to methane oxidation alperin et al 1988 conrad 2005 whiticar 1999 light isotopes are preferentially oxidized during methane oxidation alperin et al 1988 martens et al 1999 whiticar 1999 resulting in a gradual enrichment of the residual ch4 in 13c ch4 toward cores surface egger et al 2015 the rayleigh distillation function plots fig 4 show two or three distinct sets of carbon isotope fractionation factors ε c above the smtz in summer btes and winter all sites the isotope fractionation factors ε c ranged from 2 0 to 2 7 which are comparable to the fractionation factor ε c 2 derived from the high cell density methane aerobic oxidation experiments reported by templeton et al 2006 considering that the sulfate concentrations remained constant over those depths and that the slightly sustained decrease in methane concentrations was accompanied by a gradual increase in δ13c ch4 in surface sediments the aerobic oxidation of methane mox may have occurred above the smtz at these sites aerobic methane oxidizing bacteria mob are expected to dominate the surface sediment rasigraf et al 2017 studies from lacustrine and terrestrial environments suggest that mob may be less sensitive to temperature king 1992 wik et al 2014 and more adaptable to cold environments this explains our observation that δ13c ch4 could increase to 29 5 in winter fig 3b which is consistent with the findings in lake willersinnweiher that mox causes an increase in δ13c ch4 from 75 in the bottom water to 24 in the middle water einzmann 2020 in brackish coastal sediments aerobic methanotrophs at the surface of the sediment have also been found to consume a large fraction of methane not oxidized by the aom process mcdonald et al 2005 moussard et al 2009 steinle et al 2017 the depleted δ13c dic hotspots treude et al 2014 within the smtz fig 2 are likely the result of carbon isotope fractionation during aom hinrichs et al 1999 adding light carbon from methane to the dic pool chen et al 2010 haese et al 2003 yoshinaga et al 2014 the minimum values of δ13c dic ranged from 18 49 to 11 82 larger than those observed in marine sediments cf komada et al 2016 wehrmann et al 2011 wurgaft et al 2019 but consistent with coastal environments cf 19 and 12 sauer et al 2015 where they are thought to be the result of s aom the rayleigh distillation function plots fig 4 reveal a common range of carbon isotope fractionation factors ε c 8 9 to 12 5 which corresponds with the reported boundary 7 3 13 of carbon isotope fractionation factors associated with s aom in marine sediment alperin et al 1988 egger et al 2015 holler et al 2009 martens et al 1999 this result is consistent with the sharp decrease in sulfate concentration within the smtz figs 2 and 3 indicating that s aom is the main methane anaerobic oxidation process within the smtz and may even dominate the methane consumption process in the beidagang wetland both in high and low sulfate environments the carbon isotope fractionation factors below the smtz at the bgs and brs sites remain in the same sense as within the smtz fig 4 suggesting that aom still exists below the smtz at the bgs and brs sites aom may also be present below the smtz at the bts site affecting the carbon isotope fractionation process and disturbing the carbon isotope fractionation factor during methanogenesis at the bgs site aom tends to couple sulfate reduction at low sulfate concentration previous studies have shown that s aom can occur at low sulfate concentration much less than 1 mmol l 1 e g beal et al 2011 segarra et al 2015 weber et al 2017 2016 perhaps supported by a cryptic sulfur cycle holmkvist et al 2011 however at the brs site the carbon isotope fractionation factors below the smtz in summer and winter are as low as 4 3 which may be a result of the carbon isotope partitioning behavior during methanogenesis blurring the kinetic isotopic effects of carbon during the cryptic sulfur cycle another possibility is that this value is related to fe aom which has been found to play an important role in methane removal in freshwater crowe et al 2011 norði et al 2013 sivan et al 2011 wersin et al 1991 and brackish water egger et al 2015 segarra et al 2013 slomp et al 2013 environments the high active iron contents in br 3 mg g sun et al unpublished may support this hypothesis but requires more conclusive evidence in addition the downward increase in sulfate concentration at the bottom of the sediment may be an inheritance from earlier saltwater relics koebsch et al 2019 or a conseqence upwelling of deeper groundwater which further promotes anaerobic oxidation of methane in the deep sediment mogollón et al 2012 the nitrate concentrations 8 μmol l 1 of the bottom water in this study are much lower than the values minimum value is 71 4 μmol l 1 reported by he et al 2019 suggesting that n aom may not be important in the beidagang wetland 4 2 3 the contribution of s aom to sulfate reduction and methane oxidation both s aom and osr coexisting within the smtz burdige and komada 2011 komada et al 2016 consume sulfate and produce dic through sulfate reduction processes in the beidagang wetland linear sulfate profiles within the smtz fig 2 suggest that s aom may dominate the consumption of sulfate within the smtz borowski et al 1996 chuang et al 2013 hensen et al 2003 luo et al 2013 mazumdar et al 2014 niewöhner et al 1998 wallmann et al 2006 the ratio of cation adjusted dic δdic δca2 δmg2 to removed sulfate δso4 2 is often used to assess the occurrence of osr and s aom within the smtz antler et al 2014 burdige and komada 2011 chen et al 2010 haese et al 2003 hu et al 2015 liu et al 2020 luo et al 2013 peketi et al 2015 wu et al 2016 we expected a ratio of 1 1 for aom and 2 1 for osr according to the net stoichiometry of eqs 1 and 2 and found that almost all data for br and bg summer and winter within the smtz plotted along the 2 1 ratio line fig 5 which appears to indicate that osr is the main sulfate consumption process within the smtz for both br and bg the distribution of data for bt was close to the 1 1 ratio line in summer bts and between the 2 1 and 1 1 lines in winter btw suggesting that s aom removed sulfate within the smtz in summer while osr and aom coexist in winter this is consistent with the conclusions of wu et al 2015 data from the btes site also suggest that s aom and osr coexist within the smtz it should be noted that this approach is not always reliable as dic from deep sources can cause data to fall above the 2 1 line fig 5 chatterjee et al 2011 wu et al 2016 while significant authigenic carbonate precipitation in saline water with high concentrations of ca2 can drive data below the 1 1 line fig 5 liu et al 2020 to understand better the sulfate reduction pathways within the smtz and to quantify the role of s aom in sulfate reduction diffusion flux calculations across the smtz were performed see supporting information the calculation results are listed in table s2 for the brs bgs bts and btes sites the ratios of net dic produced by s aom and osr to total sulfate fluxes were 1 63 1 38 1 03 and 1 48 respectively the estimates of 1 51 1 89 and 1 62 for brw bgw btw sites in winter were greater than those in summer this result is consistent with the findings in fig 5 the sulfate fluxes diffusing into the smtz in the sediments of the open water area sediments br bg and bt were 30 75 50 74 mmol m 2 d 1 in summer and 0 52 3 07 mmol m 2 d 1 in winter for the littoral zone btes the summer flux value was 7 59 mmol m 2 d 1 according to the net dic fluxes we calculated that 37 03 96 41 of the sulfate diffusing into the smtz was reduced by s aom in summer fig 6 while the contribution of s aom to sulfate consumption f s aom within the smtz decreased in winter with the estimated range being 11 53 47 27 the variation of doc concentrations within the smtz fig s2 and s3 also supported our calculation results especially at the bgs site where doc consumption within the smtz was much higher than accumulation indicating that osr accounts for the major consumption of sulfate this is a wide range compared to the reported values for estuarine sediments cf sawicka and brüchert 2017 continental shelf cf wurgaft et al 2019 deep sea basins cf hong et al 2016 komada et al 2016 and cold seeps cf feng et al 2019 liu et al 2020 wehrmann et al 2011 further the f s aom was greater at sites with high sulfate concentrations with almost all of the sulfate 96 41 being used to consume methane at the bts site however at the btes site the sulfate concentration was the same as at bts site but s aom consumed only half of the methane within the smtz the low oxygen status of the surface sediments may inhibit strictly s aom anaerobic processes and microorganisms associated with aom were found to be viable at relatively high temperatures zehnder and brock 1980 which may also be responsible for the pathway alteration in winter on a regional scale the highest f s aom was observed in the sulfate rich ocean environment while the highest f osr was observed in an estuarine environment fig 6b probably due to the flowing river water facilitating the exchange of dissolved oxygen in the surface pore water with the overlying water consistent with the reason for the lower f s aom at btes site the calculated methane fluxes consumed by s aom in summer were 18 79 mmol m 2 d 1 19 17 mmol m 2 d 1 44 81 mmol m 2 d 1 and 3 89 mmol m 2 d 1 at brs bgs bts and btes sites respectively the estimated consumption values for brw bgw and btw sites in winter were 0 26 mmol m 2 d 1 0 06 mmol m 2 d 1 and 1 17 mmol m 2 d 1 the contribution of s aom to methane oxidation can reach 71 01 89 28 95 91 and 83 30 at brs bgs bts and btes sites in summer respectively methane oxidation decreases in winter to 22 03 46 15 and 85 40 at brw bgw and btw sites respectively the contribution of s aom to methane consumption in this study is close to previous estimates for the marine environment 90 knittel and boetius 2009 previous studies have found that s aom efficiency in the marine environment appears to be related to the rate of upward flow of sulfate depleted fluids with increased s aom efficiency at lower fluid velocity niemann et al 2006 wallmann et al 2006 xu et al 2018 2021 in some environments with very low fluid flow rates where methane rarely escapes to the bottom water steeb et al 2015 xu et al 2018 the contribution of s aom to methane consumption can be up to 98 100 knab et al 2008 xu et al 2021 the low porosity fig s4 high methane flux table s2 and sufficient sulfate in the bottom water can support high s aom efficiency at our study sites overall our results based on the calculation of diffusive fluxes demonstrate that s aom dominates methane oxidation in the beidagang wetland and make an important contribution to methane removal in both high and low sulfate concentration wetlands however the higher the sulfate concentration in the surface water of the wetland the more efficiently methane was removed 4 3 possible sources of pore water dic the concentration and stable carbon isotopic composition of pore water dic are sensitive indicators to characterize carbon cycle processes wu et al 2016 the increase of dic concentration and decrease of δ13c dic in sediment surface fig 2 are correlated with osr and s aom burdige et al 2016 komada et al 2016 wehrmann et al 2011 while the increase of δ13c dic with depth below the smtz fig 2 is related to methanogenesis by either co2 reduction or acetate fermentation conrad 2005 whiticar 1999 therefore the high concentration of dic within the smtz is a mixture of in situ light dic produced by osr and aom within the smtz and heavy dic produced by methanogenesis below the smtz chatterjee et al 2011 to estimate the relative contributions of osr s aom and methanogenesis to the dic pool in summer we applied a simple three end member mixing model komada et al 2016 wu et al 2016 5 δ 13 c added f osr δ 13 c om f s aom δ 13 c s aom f methanogenesis δ 13 c dic 6 f osr f s aom f methanogenesis 1 where f is the fraction of dic produced from osr s aom and methanogenesis the meaning of the different δ and the details of the calculation process can be found in the supporting information the final calculation results are presented in table s3 methanogenesis is the largest source of the pore water dic pool ranging from 82 56 to 88 7 while osr 0 64 8 68 and s aom 2 55 8 58 contribute relatively little to the pore water dic pool the high contribution of methanogenesis to the dic pool may influence the dic concentration within the smtz resulting in a ratio of cation adjusted dic to removed sulfate higher than 2 1 fig 5 furthermore the role of aom and methanogenesis is more important in areas of high sulfate concentration in the beidagang wetland bts and btes on a regional scale the contribution of s aom to pore water dic pool increases and the contribution of methanogenesis decreases from coastal wetlands to marine sediments fig 7 the increasing trend of methane contribution to the dic pool from marine sediments to coastal wetlands is consistent with the trend from the abyss to the inner shelf akam et al 2020 and this trend may be related to the increasing organic carbon burial rate per unit area from ocean to coastal wetlands 2 62 g c m 2 yr 1 for shelf waters 13 10 g c m 2 yr 1 for estuarine waters and 98 72 g c m 2 yr 1 for tidal wetlands najjar et al 2018 coastal wetlands have high carbon storage accounting for 50 of ocean carbon sequestration duarte et al 2013 2005 high organic carbon burial rates and high organic carbon sequestration can provide methanogens with sufficient substrate for methanogenesis egger et al 2018 which may explain such a high contribution of methanogenesis to pore water dic pool in coastal wetlands fig 7 in addition we found that the contribution of s aom to pore water dic is higher at sites with high sulfate concentrations both in the beidagang wetland and on a regional scale 4 4 the variation of the smtz depth and its controlling factors the depth of the smtz in the beidagang wetland 10 cm on average is similar to other wetlands 10 cm ng et al 2017 segarra et al 2015 2013 but shallower than that of estuarine sediments cf sawicka and brüchert 2017 wu et al 2015 and marine sediments cf egger et al 2018 and reference therein in addition significant seasonal fluctuations in the depth of the smtz were found with shallower depths near the sediment water interface in summer and moving down to deeper depths in winter similar observations were found in other studies with the smtz deeper in winter than in summer e g kleint et al 2021 maltby et al 2018 myllykangas et al 2020 sawicka and brüchert 2017 wu et al 2015 in summer elevated temperatures and high organic matter input and hypoxia due to biomass blooms middelburg and levin 2009 increase so4 2 reduction and methanogenesis rates which may lead to vertical upwards migration of smtz in sediments egger et al 2016 2015 slomp et al 2013 spatially the depth of the smtz was significantly deeper than that of open water in the littoral areas of reeds growth which may be the result of oxygen influence wehrmann et al 2011 in addition there was little variation in smtz depths in open water areas and the smtz was deeper in areas with higher bottom water sulfate concentrations which is consistent with studies in coastal marine sediments cf cao et al 2021 myllykangas et al 2020 wu et al 2015 wu et al 2015 suggested that high sulfate concentration increases the sulfate flux into the sediments and affects the depth of the smtz however a strong correlation between the depth of the smtz and bottom water sulfate concentration was not observed on a regional scale fig 8 a implying that sulfate concentration may not be a direct cause of smtz depth variation myllykangas et al 2020 a strong negative correlation between the smtz depth downward sulfate flux and upward methane flux was observed on a regional scale fig 8b c which is consistent with the global ocean sediment data of egger et al 2018 many studies have suggested that the depth of the smtz is related to the upward methane flux e g burdige and komada 2011 myllykangas et al 2020 sauer et al 2015 and that high upward methane flux will shoal the smtz borowski et al 1996 hong et al 2016 liu et al 2020 sauer et al 2015 zhang et al 2020 for example the smtz depth is typically greater than 100 cm in marine sediments while the depth of smtz in cold seeps is only a few centimeters e g fischer et al 2012 gieskes et al 2005 which may be due to the high upward methane flux in cold seeps activated methanogenesis directly affects the sulfate kinetics through aom mogollón et al 2012 as the upward diffusion flux of methane increases the activity of aom is enhanced hong et al 2016 liu et al 2020 regnier et al 2011 leading to an increased demand for sulfate which explains the strong positive correlation between downward sulfate flux and upward methane flux fig 7d high methane concentrations and high upward methane fluxes were observed in organic matter rich regions mogollón et al 2012 sawicka and brüchert 2017 zhang et al 2020 suggesting that organic matter input may be a key factor influencing the relationship between methane fluxes and smtz depth borowski et al 1996 myllykangas et al 2020 high organic matter input rates and sedimentation rates will shorten the residence time of organic matter in the sulfate reduction zone increase the methanogenic substrate below the smtz dale et al 2019 sundby 2006 promote methane production increase the upward methane flux egger et al 2016 2018 and further shoal the smtz depth weaken the filtering function of the smtz and result in more methane entering the water column and even escaping to the atmosphere gelesh et al 2016 on a regional scale the upward methane fluxes increase from marine sediments to estuarine sediments and yet further to coastal wetlands sediments by every 2 to 3 orders of magnitude fig 8 egger et al 2018 also found methane diffusive fluxes to the smtz from coastal systems up to three orders of magnitude higher compared to methanogenic deep sea sediments and suggested that this flux increase correlates with changes in sediment age at the smtz the high upward methane flux in coastal wetlands may be associated with the high carbon burial rate chmura et al 2003 duarte et al 2005 houghton 2007 this would imply that the relative contribution of methanogenesis to organic matter degradation becomes more important mogollón et al 2012 which is consistent with the relative contribution of methanogenesis to pore water dic increasing from marine environments to coastal wetlands fig 7 although we have no direct evidence that methane consumption by s aom decreased from ocean to coastal wetlands as methane within the smtz is usually assumed to be completely consumed by sulfate in flux calculations e g wu et al 2016 the contribution of s aom to the pore water dic pool decreased from ocean to coastal wetlands fig 7 which indirectly suggests a decrease in the contribution of s aom to methane consumption therefore the shoaled smtz impairs s aom and increases the potential for methane emission myllykangas et al 2020 wallenius et al 2021 the contribution of s aom to methane consumption is greater in areas with high bottom water sulfate concentrations fig 9 suggesting that bottom water sulfate concentration also has an important effect on s aom high bottom water sulfate concentrations mean that there is enough sulfate in the smtz to support methane oxidation and that sulfate can be replenished quickly and adequately the reaction of sulfate with easily available methane can support thriving microbial growth however in the areas with low sulfate concentrations there is little sulfate remaining to support methane oxidation after the osr process thus sulfate is not available to penetrate deeper to react with methane and microorganisms may have adapted to using organic matter rather than methane as a substrate for growth during their long term evolution 5 conclusions geochemical profiles patterns of sediments in the beidagang wetland tianjin china show significant temporal and spatial variability our results show that despite aerobic oxidation of methane methane consumption is mainly dominated by s aom in the beidagang wetland it consumes 71 01 95 91 of methane within the smtz and 37 03 96 41 of sulfate is consumed meanwhile within the smtz in winter this contribution become lower due to changes in dissolved oxygen and temperature in particular s aom consumes more sulfate within the smtz in areas with high bottom water sulfate concentrations while more sulfate is used for osr within the smtz in areas with low bottom water sulfate concentrations in addition methanogenesis is the largest source of the pore water dic pool with a range of 82 56 88 7 while osr 0 64 8 68 and s aom 2 55 8 58 contribute less to the pore water dic pool similarly methanogenesis and s aom contribute more to the pore water dic pool in areas with high sulfate concentrations in the bottom water in addition the smtz depths in the beidagang wetland sediments were shallower than those in estuarine and marine sediments and there were significant seasonal variations which may be caused by changes in temperature oxygen and organic matter inputs the depth of the smtz is strongly negatively correlated with the upward methane flux and the downward sulfate flux the large amount of organic carbon buried in the coastal wetlands triggers active methanogenesis leading to high upward methane fluxes that shoal the smtz resulting in high methane emissions from the coastal wetlands desalinization of coastal wetland waters caused by human intervention will reduce the supply of sulfate from the water column to the sediment weakening the s aom and impairing the barrier function of the smtz further inducing high methane emissions in coastal wetlands declaration of competing interest the authors

16062,biotransformation is the most important process removing manmade chemicals from the environment yet mechanisms governing this essential ecosystem function are underexplored to understand these mechanisms we conducted experiments in flow through systems by colonizing stream biofilms under different conditions of mixing river water with treated and ultrafiltered wastewater we performed biotransformation experiments with those biofilms using a set of 75 micropollutants and could disentangle potential mechanisms determining the biotransformation potential of stream biofilms we showed that the increased biotransformation potential downstream of wastewater treatment plants that we observed for specific micropollutants contained in household wastewaters downstream effect is caused by microorganisms released with the treated effluent rather than by the in stream exposure to those micropollutants complementary data from 16s rrna amplicon sequencing revealed 146 amplicon sequence variants asvs that followed the observed biotransformation patterns our results align with findings for community tolerance and provide clear experimental evidence that microorganisms released with treated wastewater integrate into downstream biofilms and impact crucial ecosystem functions 1 introduction establishing causal relationships between wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluents and effects on microbial community functions of the receiving aquatic ecosystems is challenging stamm et al 2016 however considering the increasing anthropogenic pollution impacting aquatic environments on a global scale there is an urgent need to understand the mechanisms leading to functional changes of these crucial ecosystems caliman and gavrilescu 2009 gavrilescu et al 2015 posthuma et al 2020 treated effluent from wwtps has for instance been recognized as one of the most dominant sources of antibiotic resistant bacteria and resistance genes to the environment collignon et al 2018 ju et al 2019 further microbes released with treated effluent have been shown to increase organic matter decomposition downstream of wwtps burdon et al 2020 these observations raise the question whether the presence of treated effluent might also effect other carbon cycling related processes such as the extent of removal of manmade chemicals from the environment through biodegradation micropollutants mps are manmade chemicals present in the environment in the low µg to ng l range they encompass many bioactive compounds which might affect aquatic ecosystems such as pharmaceutical ingredients or pesticides released through various pathways such as wwtp effluents or agricultural runoff wen et al 2017 while microbial biotransformation is recognized as the main contributor to the ultimate removal of mps from water fenner et al 2013 removal rates can vary significantly between microbial communities achermann et al 2018b latino et al 2017 wang et al 2018 yet factors leading to an increase or decrease of biotransformation are only partially understood in a previous field study we investigated mp biotransformation in biofilms grown in rivers up and downstream of two wwtp outfalls where the upstream river sections received no wastewater input to explore how exposure history impacts mp biotransformation desiante et al 2021 for a specific subset of compounds we found an increased biotransformation potential in the downstream biofilm communities compared to the upstream ones i e a downstream effect a similar effect has previously been observed for the artificial sweetener acesulfame in biotransformation studies with river sediments coll et al 2020 we concluded that understanding the spatial and temporal extent of increased biotransformation as well as the nature of mps actually showing a downstream effect is essential to properly assess the risk related to the release of mps to the aquatic environment we hypothesized that the downstream effect was either due to the presence of mps in the wwtp effluent or due to the immigration of microorganisms released from the high load activated sludge compartment of wwtps depending on the actual mechanism the relevance of the downstream effect may differ substantially given the ubiquitous presence of mps in streams impacted by urban and agricultural wastewater it is perceivable that in stream effects of chemicals may extend over long distances contrastingly if functional changes are mainly induced by the release of adapted microorganisms their spatial extent might be more limited while for ar the longitudinal effect has recently been shown to decrease rapidly lee et al 2021 such data is missing for biotransformation of mps in the present study we set out to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the increased mp biotransformation potential of biofilms grown downstream of wwtp outfalls relative to upstream biofilms downstream effect in support of such mechanistic understanding we further asked what the compounds showing a downstream effect had in common we additionally aimed to set our findings in relation to another ecologically relevant endpoint studied in the same series of experiments i e the increased tolerance of downstream communities towards toxic mps carles et al 2021 tlili et al 2016 therefore in a first experiment we attempted to reproduce the field observations reported in desiante et al 2021 under controlled conditions in an experimental flume system in which stream biofilms were cultivated at different ratios of river water and treated wastewater ww we then investigated the biotransformation capacity of these biofilms toward a pre defined set of 75 mps study compounds we chose the study compounds in our experiments such as to include a structurally diverse set of wastewater borne and non wastewater borne mps to reveal if observed effects relate to specific physico chemical or structural properties of the compounds and or to specific exposure situations and to discuss potential enzymatic pathways in a second experiment we modified the system in order to remove particles and microbes from ww while keeping the other physicochemical parameters i e mp concentrations nutrients temperature etc as constant as possible this allowed us to disentangle the effects of exposure to mps and exposure to wastewater borne microorganisms on biofilm mp biotransformation potential while excluding influences from other factors concomitantly we monitored influent and effluent mp concentrations of the wwtp producing the treated effluent for our experiments in order to compare removal of mps in the wwtp to their biotransformation in the biofilms finally we analyzed differences in the community composition in order to highlight taxa whose abundance patterns align with the downstream effect 2 materials and methods 2 1 overview in order to cultivate stream biofilms an indoor version of the maiandros experimental flow through channel system described by burdon et al 2020 was used the biofilms grown in the channel system were then used to perform two biotransformation experiments exp 1 and exp 2 to do so biofilms were suspended spiked with a mixture of 75 mps study compounds and sampled over the duration of the experiments 2 2 maiandros experimental system exp 1 the experimental channel system maiandros used to cultivate stream biofilms for exp 1 was described thoroughly by burdon et al 2020 and by carles et al 2021 for changes specific to the indoor iteration briefly the experimental system consisting of 16 equivalent flow through channels was fed with two sources of water i e river water and treated wastewater ww a lighting system that reproduces the sunlight spectrum philips master led tube hf 1200 mm was installed to ensure a photoperiod of 12h light and 12h dark the ww for this setup was produced in a pilot size wastewater treatment plant 100 person equivalents using standard activated sludge treatment for nitrification and denitrification with the influent originating from a municipal sewer in the catchment of dübendorf switzerland the river water derived from a small peri urban stream chriesbach dübendorf switzerland the treatments in the channels were adjusted to nominal concentrations of 0 control treatment 10 30 and 80 ww mixed in with river water resulting in four biological replicates per treatment 0 ww 10 ww 30 ww and 80 ww respectively manual adjustment of the treatment concentrations in the channels was done on a daily basis the treatments were randomly distributed in the 16 channels to avoid block effects and minimize systematic external influences biofilms were allowed to grow in the water fed channels on supporting glass slides for a period of four weeks from 19th of june to 15th of july 2019 during biofilm colonization water parameters ph temperature conductivity and dissolved oxygen were measured manually on a daily basis in the 16 channels and 20 water quality parameters were monitored weekly additionally during the colonization phase 52 organic micropollutants originally selected by munz et al 2017 30 of which were overlapping with the study compounds were monitored in the 16 channels in the two water sources and in the biofilms carles et al 2021 further information on the experimental system are given in carles et al 2021 2 3 maiandros experimental system exp 2 the second experiment exp 2 was conducted using a modified version of the system used for exp 1 one major change was the installation of an ultrafiltration uf unit with a nominal pore size of 0 4 µm allowing for the removal of particulates including microorganisms from ww thus in this system we had three sources of water i e river water ww and ultrafiltered ww further four additional flow through channels were added to the system resulting in 20 channels in total the water sources were used to create five treatment conditions in the channels consisting of 0 control treatment 30 and 80 ww and 30 and 80 ultrafiltered ww mixed in with river water resulting in four biological replicates per treatment 0 ww 30 ww 80 ww 30 uf and 80 uf respectively different from exp 1 the mixing ratios in the channels were controlled automatically based on on line conductivity probes of the three water sources biofilms were allowed to grow in the water fed channels on supporting glass slides for four weeks from 11th of february to 9th of march 2020 during biofilm colonization water parameters ph temperature conductivity and dissolved oxygen were measured manually on a daily basis in the 20 channels si section s1 2 and table appendix a1 and 20 water quality parameters were monitored weekly using standard methods si sections s1 2 and s1 5 and table appendix a2 foen 2020 additionally the same 52 organic micropollutants as in exp 1 were monitored in the 20 channels in the river and ww sources before and after ultrafiltration and in the biofilms si sections s1 3 s1 4 and tables appendix a3 a7 a full description of the experimental flow through channel system used for exp 2 can be found in the si section s1 1 2 4 study compounds for the biotransformation experiments a micropollutant mixture of 75 compounds was prepared referred to as study compounds the study compounds were chosen based on previous work desiante et al 2021 they comprised multiple use classes i e antibiotics anti corrosion agents artificial sweeteners fungicides herbicides insecticides and pharmaceuticals table s1 and were chosen because of their relevance to surface waters i e potential exposure and or potential toxic effects to aquatic organisms in order to explore how exposure to mps influences the biotransformation potential of stream biofilms we chose the study compounds such that roughly half of the compounds typically occur in wastewater while the rest of the compounds typically are thought to enter the aquatic environment via different pathways e g run off from agricultural fields moreover the study compounds were chosen to cover a broad range of molecular structures and thus potential initial biotransformation reactions desiante et al 2021 hplc grade chemicals were purchased from sigma aldrich gmbh honeywell specialty chemicals hpc standards gmbh dr ehrenstorfer gmbh and toronto research chemicals the 75 study compounds were combined in a spiking mix in etoh 1 mg l for analysis a mixture of 178 labelled internal standards 25 µg l in etoh was spiked to the samples and assigned to the respective study compounds a complete list of the study compounds and assigned internal standards is given in table s1 2 5 biotransformation experiments the two biotransformation experiments exp 1 and 2 were conducted in a similar manner as described in desiante et al 2021 briefly biofilms grown on five glass slides 210 75 4 mm per slide from one channel i e one biological replicate were scraped off the glass slides and combined to form a stock suspension in artificial river water i e periquil stewart et al 2015 standardization to similar biomass concentrations was done by optical density od measurements at 685 nm and by further diluting samples with higher biomass from these stock suspensions subsamples of 120 ml 110 ml and 120 ml were taken for the biotransformation experiment bt a sorption control sc and a biological control bc

to each bt sc and ac experimental vessel resulting in a final concentration of approximately 1 μg l of each substance table s1 while the bc batches were spiked with the same amount of pure etoh all experimental vessels were placed on laboratory shakers and shaken circularly at 150 rpm aqueous samples 1 5 ml of the bt batches were taken before and at approximately 0 1 2 4 8 24 48 72 and 96 hours

standard mix further information on the wwtp and evaluation of wwtp samples can be found in si section s3 2 8 micropollutant analysis in order to determine chemical concentrations the same procedure as described in desiante et al 2021 was used briefly reverse phase liquid chromatography coupled to a qexactive plus thermo scientific was used to gather positive and negative full scan ms spectra samples taken at 0 h after spiking were measured three times technical triplicates for every biological replicate micropollutant data analysis was performed according to desiante et al 2021 target quantification for the 75 study compounds was done using the software tracefinder 4 1 thermo scientific technical triplicate measurements were used to calculate the analytical error of the measurements further data evaluation of experimental data was conducted in r version 3 6 1 r core team 2017 figures of concentration time series were produced using the package ggplot2 wickham 2016 concentration time series were used to calculate first order rate constants kbio for every single biological replicate assuming pseudo first order kinetics which were then averaged in order to obtain kbio values for the investigated treatments see tables s2 and s3 for kbio values of biotransformed compounds r2 was used as quality indicator of the fit for visualization linear regression models were fitted to the log transformed values of the normalized data c c0 i e the measured concentration divided by the starting concentration including all replicates n 4 of each treatment concentration time series of all evaluated study compounds and linear regression plots for the study compounds that have been primarily biotransformed are displayed in figures s7 and s8 solid phase concentrations measured in biofilm samples were used to evaluate mass balances figures s9 and s10 based on these dominant fate processes were assigned to each compound as described in desiante et al 2021 si section s2 1 in order to compare biotransformation trends across the biotransformed chemicals and the biofilm communities we level normalized the calculated kbio for each chemical across treatments and created heatmaps using the r package pheatmap kolde 2015 van den berg et al 2006 2 9 bacterial abundance quantification by flow cytometry during the biofilm colonization phase of exp 2 six samples for flow cytometry were taken from the treated wastewater buffer tank ww and directly after ultrafiltration uf on day two nine 16 19 21 and 23 after starting the colonization during the biotransformation experiments exp 1 and exp 2 samples of the bt and bc batches were taken right before spiking and at 48 and 96 h the sample processing and measurements were conducted in the same way as described in desiante et al 2021 briefly 5 ml of the samples were fixated with 5 ml buffer solution 4 paraformaldehyde 0 2 sodium pyrophosphate in glass vials and stored at 4 c after ultrasonication 4 20s the samples were diluted stained with 1 sybr green 1 100 dilution in dmso and incubated at 37 c for 10 min measurements were conducted on a bd accuri c6 flow cytometer bd accuri san jose ca usa flow cytometry data processing and analysis was done with the bd accuritm c6 analysis software obtained total cell counts were used for graphical representation in r version 3 6 1 with the package ggplot2 r core team 2017 wickham 2016 for bacterial abundance time patterns please see si sections s2 3 and s2 4 2 10 total biomass quantification ash free dry mass afdm sampling for total biomass quantification was done prior to and after 96 h in exp 1 and after 48 and 96 h in exp 2 for the bt and bc respectively to do so 10 ml of the suspension were filtered over pre equilibrated and pre weighed 47 mm glass microfiber filters gf f grade whatman maidstone united kingdom filters were dried in a ventilated oven 105 c and allowed to equilibrate in a desiccator before weighing again in order to determine the dry mass filters were then wrapped in aluminum foil muffled 80 min heating up to 450 c 1h at 450 c cool down allowed to equilibrate and weighed again in order to determine the weight of the mineral residues total biomass i e afdm data analysis was done according to standard procedure the determined weight of the mineral residues was subtracted from the determined dry mass in order to obtain the afdm the determined afdm values were used for graphical representation in r version 3 6 1 with the package ggplot2 r core team 2017 wickham 2016 for total biomass growth patterns please see si sections s2 3 and s2 4 2 11 data analysis and statistics in order to assess how much the treatment or the biomass expressed as bacterial abundance or total biomass accounted for the variability in kbio across the different biofilm communities we compared the predictive performance r2 of different linear regressions models for the logarithmized kbio log kbio we fitted linear regressions with treatment cells and afdm as explanatory variables in the following combinations model treatment cells afdm 1 x x 2 x 3 x x 4 x 5 x where treatment stands for one of the nine individual treatments of both exp 1 and exp 2 cells for the bacterial abundance at 0 h determined by flow cytometry for individual biological replicates n 4 9 and afdm for the total biomass at 0 h for individual biological replicates n 4 9 we then compared goodness of fit r2 between the models if the difference in r2 between a model containing both treatment and biomass compared to a model containing only one of the explanatory variables is small we can conclude that the respective single explanatory variable i e treatment cells or afdm explained the larger part of the variability in the model with two explanatory variables and vice versa for large differences in r2 in order to assess the individual contribution of treatment and cells to the model containing both of these explanatory variables we compared r2 of model 1 with r2 of models 2 and 5 analogously to assess the individual contribution of treatment and afdm to the model containing both of these explanatory variables we compared r2 of model 3 with r2 of models 4 and 5 thus we were able to separate the effect of treatment from the effect of biomass for graphs visualizing models 2 4 and 5 and a table containing the calculated r2 values for all models see si section 2 2 models were fitted using r version 3 6 1 r core team 2017 2 12 16s rrna amplicon sequencing total genomic dna was extracted from an aliquot of 2 ml from each biofilm suspension after 4 weeks of colonization and from 100 ml ww samples taken regularly 12 sampling times during biofilm colonization by using the dneasy powerbiofilm kit qiagen following the manufacturer s instructions the biofilm samples were centrifuged at 14 000 g for 30 min at 4 c and the pellets stored at 80 c until their analyses the sampling of wastewater during exp 1 is described in carles et al 2021 during exp 2 composite wastewater samples were taken regularly and immediately filtered on supor polyethersulfone membrane disc filters with 0 2 µm pore size pall corporation usa the filters were stored at 80 c and cut in small pieces prior to dna extraction the library construction consisted in a two step pcr process briefly the first pcr amplified the v3 v4 region of the 16s rrna gene using the primer set described by herlemann et al 2011 the second pcr was carried out to add multiplexing indices and illumina sequencing adapters the libraries were then normalized pooled and sequenced paired end 2 300 nt illumina miseq following the manufacture s run protocols illumina inc all raw sequences are available at the national center for biotechnology information ncbi under the sra accession ids prjna699298 exp 1 and prjna755072 exp 2 sequencing data processing amplicon sequence variants asvs binning and taxonomic assignment were done according to carles et al 2021 briefly the reads were checked for quality and end trimmed by using fastqc v0 11 2 andrews 2010 and seqtk https github com lh3 seqtk respectively and then merged using flash v1 2 11 magoč and salzberg 2011 the primers were trimmed by using cutadapt v1 12 martin 2011 quality filtering was performed with prinseq lite v0 20 4 with a subsequent size and gc selection step schmieder and edwards 2011 the reads were processed with an amplicon sequence variants asv analysis callahan et al 2017 the sample reads were first denoised into asvs with unoise3 in the usearch software v 11 0 667 the final predicted taxonomic assignments were performed with silva v128 by using sintax in the usearch software v 11 0 667 edgar 2016 the total number of reads obtained at each bioinformatics step is reported in table s5 an untargeted sequencing data analysis was performed in order to identify taxa that were transferred from the wwtp into biofilms and whose abundance patterns followed the downstream effect observed in the biodegradation experiments the selection was based on the following criteria see si section s4 for the details 1 the asvs detected in biofilm at the end of the colonization period were also found in the wastewater effluent exp 1 2 2 their abundance was significantly higher in 80 ww biofilms than in control exp1 2 3 they were detected in both experiments and 4 their abundance was significantly reduced by ultrafiltration exp 2 applying these criteria we selected a total of 135 and 146 taxa from exp 1 and 2 respectively figure s31 additionally a targeted analysis was also carried out to identify taxa with high sequence similarity to species previously reported to degrade compounds showing the downstream effect more information on methods and results of the targeted analysis are provided in the si section s4 3 results 3 1 biotransformation of specific mps depends on proportion of ww in the first set of experiments exp 1 biofilms grown at four different treatment conditions 0 10 30 and 80 nominal treated wastewater ww concentration in the receiving channels were used to conduct biotransformation batch experiments with the 75 study compounds experimental performance has already been evaluated and discussed in carles et al 2021 and is summarized in si section s1 4 of the 75 study compounds 38 were predominantly biotransformed rather than mostly sorbed or bioaccumulated see si section s2 1 1 for those we calculated biotransformation rate constants kbio by fitting a first order kinetic model to their concentration time series see fig 1 for the examples of acesulfame and caffeine and figures s7 and s8 for the remaining compounds the calculated kbio values for all 38 biotransformed compounds are given in tables s2 and s3 in exp 1 for the example of acesulfame no significant concentration decrease was observed in the 0 and 10 ww treatments while we saw a sudden onset of biotransformation in the 30 ww treatment and an even faster removal of the compound in the 80 ww treatment fig 1a a similar pattern of increasing biotransformation with increasing proportion of ww was also observed for the compound caffeine which however was already biotransformed to some extent in the control biofilms 0 ww fig 1a besides acesulfame and caffeine nine more out of the 38 biotransformed compounds i e the artificial sweeteners cyclamate and saccharin the insect repellent deet and the pharmaceuticals cilastatin eprosartan furosemide ketoprofen levetiracetam and valsartan showed a similar pattern of increased biotransformation at increased amounts of ww albeit the exact onset of increased biotransformation in terms of ww differed between compounds si section s2 1 6 3 2 ultrafiltration prevents the downstream effect to distinguish the effect of increased mp concentrations from the potential influence of microorganisms released with the treated ww the second set of experiments exp 2 included treatments at 30 and 80 ww in which the treated ww was subjected to ultrafiltration uf before being fed into the flow through channels this resulted in biofilms grown for four weeks at five different treatment conditions 0 ww 30 ww 30 uf 80 ww and 80 uf where uf stands for ww that has additionally been passed through the uf unit these biofilms were then again used in batch experiments to study biotransformation of the 75 study compounds experimental performance of exp 2 is discussed in si s1 5 analysis of concentration time series and resulting rate constants from exp 2 revealed a number of striking patterns we found that seven out of the eleven compounds having shown a dependence on the proportion of ww in exp 1 i e acesulfame caffeine cyclamate deet levetiracetam saccharin and valsartan exhibited strong responses to the uf treatment i e a reduction of the average kbio for those seven compounds from 4 2 and 4 0 day 1 in the 30 and 80 ww treatments to 0 8 and 0 4 day 1 in the 30 and 80 uf treatments compared to 0 6 day 1 in the 0 ww control treatment this is again exemplarily illustrated in terms of the actual concentration time series and kinetic fits for acesulfame and caffeine in fig 1b as can be seen in fig 1b acesulfame again was persistent in the control treatment 0 ww but was removed in the 30 and 80 ww treatments yet strikingly ultrafiltration 30 and 80 uf reversed this effect to the extent that no observable acesulfame biotransformation occurred in the uf treatments a similar pattern was found for caffeine while it was removed to a small degree in the control higher removal was observed in the ww samples but ultrafiltration 30 and 80 uf prevented the effect of ww to similar levels of removal as observed in the control these results suggest that the downstream effect must result from particle bound traits that are released by the wwtp yet filtered out by ultrafiltration in exp 2 as the pore size of the ultrafiltration membrane ranges around 0 4 µm it is highly unlikely that dna fragments are removed in this step but rather bacteria and larger sludge particles 3 3 treatment not biomass amount dictates biotransformation potential of compounds showing the downstream effect in order to control for effects of biomass and treatment conditions on biotransformation we determined total biomass and bacterial abundance in the biofilm suspensions prepared for the biotransformation experiments fig 2 for the biofilm suspensions prepared for exp 1 we determined a mean total biomass afdm of 0 66 0 12 g l across all biofilms at the beginning of the experiment fig 2a and a mean bacterial biomass of 179 47 cells nl fig 2b in exp 1 biomass was comparable between treatments and no dependence of biomass with increasing ww percentage was observable in exp 2 the mean total biomass and bacterial abundance was 1 03 0 15 g l and 276 67 cells nl respectively here a trend towards higher biomass in non filtered versus ultrafiltered treatments was discernible however statistical analysis comparing the relative importance of biomass and treatment on kbio confirmed that treatment conditions explained most of the variability in the rate constants for the chemicals showing the downstream effect while biomass differences played only a minor role si section s2 2 we also compared biomass dynamics over the course of the experiments between the different treatments and between biotransformation bt batches and unspiked biological controls bc see si sections s2 3 and s2 4 we found that biomass was dynamic but that dynamics were comparable between the treatments within experiments and between spiked and unspiked batches in both experiments 3 4 mps with highest influent concentrations typically showed highest removal in wwtp in order to compare the removal of mps in the wwtp to the biotransformation potential in the biofilms we monitored influent and effluent concentrations of the study compounds in the wwtp producing the treated effluent for our experiments fig 3 lower panel based on these data we calculated the percentage removal of the compounds that were found in measurable concentrations in the influent fig 3 upper panel and si section s3 interestingly the compounds that were removed to the highest extent 80 during wastewater treatment also were amongst those exhibiting the highest influent concentrations 1000 ng l indeed only a few compounds with comparably high influent concentrations i e 4 5 methyl benzotriazole benzotriazole and diclofenac in both experiments and acesulfame and deet in exp 2 did not show removals 80 however it is to note that acesulfame and deet still were removed by 77 and 59 during wastewater treatment in exp 2 respectively while the first three mps were fully persistent during wastewater treatment in exp 1 and showed removal of only 39 57 and 29 in exp 2 respectively within the study compounds the majority of mps with influent concentrations 1000 ng l were removed to a lesser extent i e 80 during wastewater treatment with the exception of mefenamic acid exp 1 mianserin exp 1 trifloxystrobin exp 1 and ranitidine exp 2 however the measured concentrations of the last three were close to their respective loq and their calculated removal thus highly uncertain leaving mefenamic acid as the sole clear exception with removal 80 despite an influent concentration 1000 ng l for our study compounds 3 5 identification of taxa aligning with downstream effect sequencing of the 16s rrna gene was performed for biomass sampled from biofilms and ww from both experiments taxa present in ww and differently abundant in a given treatment compared to the control 0 ww were selected from the 16s dataset of exp 1 figure s31 we found 184 taxa originating from ww that followed a pattern of higher abundance with higher amounts of ww in exp 2 we found 202 taxa that also showed an increasing pattern with increasing ww but which relative to the 0 ww control were not significantly more abundant in the uf treatments figure s31 combining these two datasets lead to a final list of 146 taxa originating from wastewater whose abundance patterns followed the patterns in kbio for the mps showing the downstream effect fig 4 for a complete list of these taxa see table appendix a8 4 discussion with this study we aimed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying observations of increased mp biotransformation for a number of chemicals in biofilms grown downstream of wwtp outfalls relative to upstream biofilms downstream effect so far our results clearly demonstrate that 1 the downstream effect is reproducible under controlled conditions and scaled with the percentage of ww in exp 1 2 ultrafiltration i e removal of particles and microorganisms deriving from the wwtp prevented the downstream effect in exp 2 3 biotransformation was dictated by the microbial community composition i e the treatment condition rather than only by bacterial abundance in the batch experiments 4 with very few exceptions compounds that were removed to the highest extent 80 in the wwtp also exhibited the highest influent concentrations 1000 ng l 5 146 bacterial taxa showed abundance patterns that are consistent with the downstream effect by combining these key results a nuanced picture emerges fig 5 as can be seen in fig 5 we identified three major clusters a b and c of mp biotransformation patterns based on the level normalized kbio values obtained for the different biofilm communities cluster a which contained 26 and hence the majority of the 38 biotransformed compounds was least influenced by the treatment conditions it contained the majority of compounds that had not shown a downstream effect in our previous study and whose biotransformation seemed to largely align with bacterial abundance trends in our previous data desiante et al 2021 this is in agreement with the fact that cluster a contains mostly compounds that are thought to be biotransformed by enzymes that are ubiquitous among living organisms or enzymes that are closely related to bacterial growth achermann et al 2018a achermann et al 2018b desiante et al 2021 johnson et al 2015 all taken together the findings from this and our previous study desiante et al 2021 point toward co metabolism the transformation of a non growth substrate in the obligate presence of a growth substrate or another transformable compound as the major biotransformation process for these compounds dalton and stirling 1982 cluster a was separated from clusters b and c which both contain compounds that showed a clear downstream effect in exp 1 fig 5 of those cluster b contains those seven compounds that show no downstream effect upon ultrafiltration in exp 2 while cluster c contains five compounds that actually were removed on average to the highest extent in the 80 uf treatment in exp 2 as can be seen from the information on influent concentrations and removal in the wwtp added as annotations in fig 5 all of the compounds in cluster b were present in high concentrations 1000 ng l in the influent to the wwtp and were removed to a large extent 80 during wastewater treatment interestingly the five compounds previously shown to exhibit a downstream effect in natural streams i e acesulfame cyclamate deet levetiracetam and saccharin are all contained in cluster b desiante et al 2021 we also note that diclofenac the only compound with high influent concentrations but removal 80 in both exp 1 and exp 2 does not fall into cluster b combining all evidence from exp 1 and exp 2 suggests that the increased biotransformation capacity of the biofilms with increased percentage of wastewater i e the downstream effect observed for cluster b compounds is most likely caused directly by bacteria or larger aggregates thereof being released from the wwtp with the treated effluent in principle there are at least two mechanisms how this could influence the biotransformation capacity of the biofilms i the microorganisms being released with treated effluent capable of degrading the mps in cluster b may either directly colonize the biofilms or ii their biotransformation traits may be transferred to other microorganisms growing in the biofilms by e g horizontal gene transfer based on the 16s data rrna data we identified 146 taxa that were present in ww showed increasing abundances in biofilms with increasing ww proportion and were filtered out by ultrafiltration these findings confirmed that there are indeed bacterial taxa originating from the wwtp that can establish in biofilms growing downstream of wwtps as previously shown carles et al 2021 chonova et al 2019 mußmann et al 2013 more importantly these taxa exhibited relative abundance patterns across exp 1 and exp 2 that follow patterns of relative biotransformation rate constants for compounds showing the downstream effect i e cluster b compounds consequently it may be speculated that some of these taxa were involved in the degradation of cluster b compounds it is now interesting to further note that the compounds in cluster b exclusively exhibit both high influent concentrations to and high removal in the wwtp in combination with the fact that the capacity to degrade these compounds in biofilms is dependent on ww borne particles filtered out by ultrafiltration our results therefore suggest that the downstream effect is not only caused by microorganisms originating from the wwtp but that these microorganisms have adapted to biotransform the specific compounds in cluster b which reach the wwtp in comparably high concentrations of 1000 ng l with respect to the main aim of this study i e to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the increased mp biotransformation potential of biofilms grown downstream of wwtps we can therefore further conclude that the downstream effect is mostly due to those adapted microorganisms integrating into downstream biofilms and or transfering their increased biotransformation capacity to the biofilms in turn at least for compounds in cluster b this falsifies the hypothesis that elevated mp concentrations from wwtp effluents and in situ adaptation in the river itself explain the increased biotransformation in downstream biofilms it needs to be noted though that the biofilm colonization period in our experiments was only four weeks while the biofilms did reach a mature stage during that time time series experiments would be required to definitely exclude any long term effects of in stream exposure to mps on the downstream biofilms biodegradation capacity in support of our interpretation evolutionary adaptation of bacteria in wwtps has been previously shown for the compound acesulfame whose biotransformation during activated sludge treatment suddenly emerged around the year 2010 while it has previously been considered a conservative tracer compound castronovo et al 2017 kahl et al 2018 kleinsteuber et al 2019 also evidence from previous field studies in combination with the fact that the compounds in cluster b are commonly amongst the best removed compounds in different wwtps confirms that the phenomenon at least for some of the compounds is observable across different wwtps and downstream river environments buerge et al 2009 castronovo et al 2017 coll et al 2020 desiante et al 2021 gurke et al 2015 margot et al 2015 seller et al 2020 moreover having performed the two experiments in different seasons i e summer 2019 and late winter 2020 confirms that our findings are also robust on a temporal scale an interesting follow up question that arises from our observations is how this adaptation occurred in the wwtp in the first place and why exactly for the seven compounds in cluster b is it mostly due to the high influent concentrations that part of the activated sludge microbial consortium have adapted to and use as steady sources of carbon or other nutrients or to what extent is it related to the chemical structures of the compounds e g by all of those compounds sharing certain metabolic pathways as can be seen from fig 6 there is no single functional group that unites all of these compounds yet they all contain either an amide or sulfonamide substructure that could potentially be hydrolyzed by enzymes belonging to the amidohydrolase family while to the best of our knowledge enzymatic reaction mechanisms that are involved in the biotransformation of these compounds in stream biofilms have not yet been investigated there are several studies investigating reaction pathways and enzymes involved in the biotransformation of these compounds in pure or enrichment cultures fig 6 for acesulfame for instance there is evidence for full catabolic biodegradation in activated sludge castronovo et al 2017 enriched microbial consortia as well as isolated bacterial species of the genera bosea and chelatococcus huang et al 2021 kleinsteuber et al 2019 and it has been suggested that the pathway involves formation of sulfamic acid and acetoacetate through sequential action of a sulfohydrolase and an amidohydrolase enzyme kleinsteuber et al 2019 cyclamate has been shown to be transformed by the enzyme cyclamate sulfamatase extracted from pseudomonas sp to form cyclohexylamine and sulfate nimura et al 1974 in contrast to these initial hydrolytic transformations for the other compounds mostly initial oxidative transformations haven been reported saccharin has been proposed to be biotransformed to the compound catechol in a two step process involving the enzyme saccharin dioxygenase in sphingomonas xenophaga skn schleheck and cook 2003 for the biotransformation of deet three enzymatic pathways were suggested involving a hydrolase encoded on a gene found in pseudomonas putida dtb and a monooxygenase and a dehydrogenase pathway helbling et al 2010b rivera cancel et al 2007 for caffeine two pathways have been proposed the first involving demethylases found in plants bacteria and fungi and the second involving a caffeine 1 3 7 trimethylxanthine oxidase from klebsiella and rhodococcus hakil et al 1998 madyastha et al 1999 mazzafera 2004 while for valsartan and levetiracetam no pure or enrichment culture data detailing involved enzymes or taxa are available transformation product analysis from activated sludge studies suggests that valsartan transformation is primarily initiated through oxidative n dealkylation whereas the primary amide levetiracetam is primarily enzymatically hydrolyzed helbling et al 2010a overall the pathway information gathered so far does not support the notion of a shared initial biotransformation reaction for the seven compounds in cluster b which is further supported by the fact that the onset of biotransformation is observed at different percentages of ww in exp 1 for the different compounds in turn this suggests the elevated wwtp influent concentrations as possible alternative explanation for the adaptation to degrade cluster b compounds indeed concepts of wwtp biotechnology stipulate that the growth rate needs to exceed the loss rate i e from withdrawal of excess sludge and with the effluent for bacteria with a specific metabolic capacity to establish in an activated sludge process since growth rates of specific degraders depend on substrate concentration it has been proposed as early as in 1994 that percentage removal in wwtps and half lives in downstream aquatic environments can be predicted based on influent concentrations blok 1994 however only very recently a correlation between biotransformation rate constants in wwtps and wwtp influent concentrations has actually been demonstrated based on monitoring data for a large and diverse set of mps nolte et al 2020 also more recent data from studies using compound specific isotope analysis experimentally demonstrated that mass transfer limitations may prevent catabolic degradation of mps below a certain concentration limit in the low µg l range kundu et al 2019 sun et al 2021 this is consistent with earlier studies on the concentration dependence of biodegradation kinetics of two herbicides that revealed a threshold of approximately 1 10 µg l above which growth of specific degrader biomass was observed toräng et al 2003 in our study the data suggests that the concentration limit for compounds showing the downstream effect lies in the range of 1 µg l yet at the same time there was also one compound reaching the wwtp in concentrations above 1 µg l that did not show high removal in the wwtp i e diclofenac and consistently also did not show a downstream effect confirming that concentration limits for metabolic degradation are substrate specific and or that certain compounds may be fully recalcitrant to biodegradation even at high concentrations schwarzenbach et al 2005 the lack of high wwtp influent concentrations and their lower removal in the wwtp might also offer a key to understanding the deviating behavior of compounds in cluster c while they show a downstream effect this effect is not removed through ultrafiltration at least not at 80 ww contrasting this with cluster b behavior these findings suggest that mechanisms other than the release of adapted degrader bacteria must underlie the downstream effect for cluster c compounds indeed for these compounds observations are more consistent with a direct effect of in stream exposure to mps on the periphyton overall our results suggest that community composition drives the biotransformation patterns we observed for cluster b compounds to shed some more light on what specific taxa might potentially be involved in biodegrading individual cluster b compounds we searched the 146 taxa whose abundance patterns align with the downstream effect for high sequence similarity with species previously reported to degrade compounds showing the downstream effect see table s6 and si section s4 one notable finding from this analysis was a taxon annotated as sm1a02 from the family phycisphaeraceae whose abundance pattern was fully consistent with the rate constant pattern of cluster b compounds and which showed strong and significant fold changes between 0 and 80 ww in exp 1 and 2 log2 fold change 4 table appendix a8 these taxa have been shown to dominate acesulfame degrading communities enriched from the activated sludge of six municipal wastewater treatment plants huang et al 2021 and bioreactors with emerging acesulfame degradation capacity unpublished data recent sequencing data also reported on the presence of putative sulfohydrolase genes in microalgae associated phycisphaeraceae sp thus confirming the potential role of sm1a02 in acesulfame degradation in biofilm communities rambo et al 2020 these results support the notion that some of the 146 taxa revealed through pattern analysis indeed may be involved in degradation of compounds from cluster b yet such hypotheses emerging from the data still need to be confirmed by complementary approaches such as culture isolation methods and identification quantification of functional genes related to biodegradation processes 5 conclusions two major implications arise from the results of our study first we provide clear experimental evidence that non disinfected wwtp effluents change an ecological function of downstream biofilms in this case their biotransformation potential while this seems overall beneficial in the case of biotransformation since it contributes to lowering exposure to mps in biofilms and hence in the overall stream environment it raises the question what other functional changes might occur in biofilms exposed to treated ww for instance our results which demonstrate the transfer of bacteria adapted to degrade mps from the wwtp into stream biofilms and the establishment of that degradation capacity in those biofilms suggest that it is likely that transfer of resistant bacteria and or resistance genes also support the transfer of ar factors from wwtps into biofilms abe et al 2020 balcázar 2018 marti et al 2013 woegerbauer et al 2020 similarly another resistance mechanism i e pollution induced community tolerance of biofilms against mps has previously been shown to be elevated downstream of wwtps corcoll et al 2014 tlili et al 2016 tlili et al 2017 and to increase with increasing proportions of ww especially for the phototrophic compartment of biofilm communities carles et al 2021 it has been hypothesized that the increased tolerance is caused by the mps released with the wwtp effluents exerting a selective pressure on downstream communities resulting in the extinction of sensitive and establishment of tolerant species however our results support a second plausible hypothesis i e that the increase in tolerance in downstream biofilms might be due to integration of already tolerant species released with the ww or more indirectly due to changes in the biofilm communities that endow increased tolerance to the phototrophic community members through yet unknown mechanisms second our study revealed distinct differences in mp degradation patterns amongst biofilms grown with different proportions of non disinfected ww for compounds potentially undergoing metabolic degradation versus those more likely undergoing co metabolic biotransformation the type of mesocosm experiments introduced here could therefore become a useful tool to distinguish co metabolically from metabolically degraded compounds in a highly environmentally relevant setting this will allow studying questions of fundamental interest in environmental chemistry such as how molecular structure influences which compounds can be metabolically degraded in the environment and at what concentrations or which families of microbes are most likely to be involved in such metabolic degradation such information is essential in order to design compounds that are readily biodegradable in a river environment

16062,biotransformation is the most important process removing manmade chemicals from the environment yet mechanisms governing this essential ecosystem function are underexplored to understand these mechanisms we conducted experiments in flow through systems by colonizing stream biofilms under different conditions of mixing river water with treated and ultrafiltered wastewater we performed biotransformation experiments with those biofilms using a set of 75 micropollutants and could disentangle potential mechanisms determining the biotransformation potential of stream biofilms we showed that the increased biotransformation potential downstream of wastewater treatment plants that we observed for specific micropollutants contained in household wastewaters downstream effect is caused by microorganisms released with the treated effluent rather than by the in stream exposure to those micropollutants complementary data from 16s rrna amplicon sequencing revealed 146 amplicon sequence variants asvs that followed the observed biotransformation patterns our results align with findings for community tolerance and provide clear experimental evidence that microorganisms released with treated wastewater integrate into downstream biofilms and impact crucial ecosystem functions 1 introduction establishing causal relationships between wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluents and effects on microbial community functions of the receiving aquatic ecosystems is challenging stamm et al 2016 however considering the increasing anthropogenic pollution impacting aquatic environments on a global scale there is an urgent need to understand the mechanisms leading to functional changes of these crucial ecosystems caliman and gavrilescu 2009 gavrilescu et al 2015 posthuma et al 2020 treated effluent from wwtps has for instance been recognized as one of the most dominant sources of antibiotic resistant bacteria and resistance genes to the environment collignon et al 2018 ju et al 2019 further microbes released with treated effluent have been shown to increase organic matter decomposition downstream of wwtps burdon et al 2020 these observations raise the question whether the presence of treated effluent might also effect other carbon cycling related processes such as the extent of removal of manmade chemicals from the environment through biodegradation micropollutants mps are manmade chemicals present in the environment in the low µg to ng l range they encompass many bioactive compounds which might affect aquatic ecosystems such as pharmaceutical ingredients or pesticides released through various pathways such as wwtp effluents or agricultural runoff wen et al 2017 while microbial biotransformation is recognized as the main contributor to the ultimate removal of mps from water fenner et al 2013 removal rates can vary significantly between microbial communities achermann et al 2018b latino et al 2017 wang et al 2018 yet factors leading to an increase or decrease of biotransformation are only partially understood in a previous field study we investigated mp biotransformation in biofilms grown in rivers up and downstream of two wwtp outfalls where the upstream river sections received no wastewater input to explore how exposure history impacts mp biotransformation desiante et al 2021 for a specific subset of compounds we found an increased biotransformation potential in the downstream biofilm communities compared to the upstream ones i e a downstream effect a similar effect has previously been observed for the artificial sweetener acesulfame in biotransformation studies with river sediments coll et al 2020 we concluded that understanding the spatial and temporal extent of increased biotransformation as well as the nature of mps actually showing a downstream effect is essential to properly assess the risk related to the release of mps to the aquatic environment we hypothesized that the downstream effect was either due to the presence of mps in the wwtp effluent or due to the immigration of microorganisms released from the high load activated sludge compartment of wwtps depending on the actual mechanism the relevance of the downstream effect may differ substantially given the ubiquitous presence of mps in streams impacted by urban and agricultural wastewater it is perceivable that in stream effects of chemicals may extend over long distances contrastingly if functional changes are mainly induced by the release of adapted microorganisms their spatial extent might be more limited while for ar the longitudinal effect has recently been shown to decrease rapidly lee et al 2021 such data is missing for biotransformation of mps in the present study we set out to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the increased mp biotransformation potential of biofilms grown downstream of wwtp outfalls relative to upstream biofilms downstream effect in support of such mechanistic understanding we further asked what the compounds showing a downstream effect had in common we additionally aimed to set our findings in relation to another ecologically relevant endpoint studied in the same series of experiments i e the increased tolerance of downstream communities towards toxic mps carles et al 2021 tlili et al 2016 therefore in a first experiment we attempted to reproduce the field observations reported in desiante et al 2021 under controlled conditions in an experimental flume system in which stream biofilms were cultivated at different ratios of river water and treated wastewater ww we then investigated the biotransformation capacity of these biofilms toward a pre defined set of 75 mps study compounds we chose the study compounds in our experiments such as to include a structurally diverse set of wastewater borne and non wastewater borne mps to reveal if observed effects relate to specific physico chemical or structural properties of the compounds and or to specific exposure situations and to discuss potential enzymatic pathways in a second experiment we modified the system in order to remove particles and microbes from ww while keeping the other physicochemical parameters i e mp concentrations nutrients temperature etc as constant as possible this allowed us to disentangle the effects of exposure to mps and exposure to wastewater borne microorganisms on biofilm mp biotransformation potential while excluding influences from other factors concomitantly we monitored influent and effluent mp concentrations of the wwtp producing the treated effluent for our experiments in order to compare removal of mps in the wwtp to their biotransformation in the biofilms finally we analyzed differences in the community composition in order to highlight taxa whose abundance patterns align with the downstream effect 2 materials and methods 2 1 overview in order to cultivate stream biofilms an indoor version of the maiandros experimental flow through channel system described by burdon et al 2020 was used the biofilms grown in the channel system were then used to perform two biotransformation experiments exp 1 and exp 2 to do so biofilms were suspended spiked with a mixture of 75 mps study compounds and sampled over the duration of the experiments 2 2 maiandros experimental system exp 1 the experimental channel system maiandros used to cultivate stream biofilms for exp 1 was described thoroughly by burdon et al 2020 and by carles et al 2021 for changes specific to the indoor iteration briefly the experimental system consisting of 16 equivalent flow through channels was fed with two sources of water i e river water and treated wastewater ww a lighting system that reproduces the sunlight spectrum philips master led tube hf 1200 mm was installed to ensure a photoperiod of 12h light and 12h dark the ww for this setup was produced in a pilot size wastewater treatment plant 100 person equivalents using standard activated sludge treatment for nitrification and denitrification with the influent originating from a municipal sewer in the catchment of dübendorf switzerland the river water derived from a small peri urban stream chriesbach dübendorf switzerland the treatments in the channels were adjusted to nominal concentrations of 0 control treatment 10 30 and 80 ww mixed in with river water resulting in four biological replicates per treatment 0 ww 10 ww 30 ww and 80 ww respectively manual adjustment of the treatment concentrations in the channels was done on a daily basis the treatments were randomly distributed in the 16 channels to avoid block effects and minimize systematic external influences biofilms were allowed to grow in the water fed channels on supporting glass slides for a period of four weeks from 19th of june to 15th of july 2019 during biofilm colonization water parameters ph temperature conductivity and dissolved oxygen were measured manually on a daily basis in the 16 channels and 20 water quality parameters were monitored weekly additionally during the colonization phase 52 organic micropollutants originally selected by munz et al 2017 30 of which were overlapping with the study compounds were monitored in the 16 channels in the two water sources and in the biofilms carles et al 2021 further information on the experimental system are given in carles et al 2021 2 3 maiandros experimental system exp 2 the second experiment exp 2 was conducted using a modified version of the system used for exp 1 one major change was the installation of an ultrafiltration uf unit with a nominal pore size of 0 4 µm allowing for the removal of particulates including microorganisms from ww thus in this system we had three sources of water i e river water ww and ultrafiltered ww further four additional flow through channels were added to the system resulting in 20 channels in total the water sources were used to create five treatment conditions in the channels consisting of 0 control treatment 30 and 80 ww and 30 and 80 ultrafiltered ww mixed in with river water resulting in four biological replicates per treatment 0 ww 30 ww 80 ww 30 uf and 80 uf respectively different from exp 1 the mixing ratios in the channels were controlled automatically based on on line conductivity probes of the three water sources biofilms were allowed to grow in the water fed channels on supporting glass slides for four weeks from 11th of february to 9th of march 2020 during biofilm colonization water parameters ph temperature conductivity and dissolved oxygen were measured manually on a daily basis in the 20 channels si section s1 2 and table appendix a1 and 20 water quality parameters were monitored weekly using standard methods si sections s1 2 and s1 5 and table appendix a2 foen 2020 additionally the same 52 organic micropollutants as in exp 1 were monitored in the 20 channels in the river and ww sources before and after ultrafiltration and in the biofilms si sections s1 3 s1 4 and tables appendix a3 a7 a full description of the experimental flow through channel system used for exp 2 can be found in the si section s1 1 2 4 study compounds for the biotransformation experiments a micropollutant mixture of 75 compounds was prepared referred to as study compounds the study compounds were chosen based on previous work desiante et al 2021 they comprised multiple use classes i e antibiotics anti corrosion agents artificial sweeteners fungicides herbicides insecticides and pharmaceuticals table s1 and were chosen because of their relevance to surface waters i e potential exposure and or potential toxic effects to aquatic organisms in order to explore how exposure to mps influences the biotransformation potential of stream biofilms we chose the study compounds such that roughly half of the compounds typically occur in wastewater while the rest of the compounds typically are thought to enter the aquatic environment via different pathways e g run off from agricultural fields moreover the study compounds were chosen to cover a broad range of molecular structures and thus potential initial biotransformation reactions desiante et al 2021 hplc grade chemicals were purchased from sigma aldrich gmbh honeywell specialty chemicals hpc standards gmbh dr ehrenstorfer gmbh and toronto research chemicals the 75 study compounds were combined in a spiking mix in etoh 1 mg l for analysis a mixture of 178 labelled internal standards 25 µg l in etoh was spiked to the samples and assigned to the respective study compounds a complete list of the study compounds and assigned internal standards is given in table s1 2 5 biotransformation experiments the two biotransformation experiments exp 1 and 2 were conducted in a similar manner as described in desiante et al 2021 briefly biofilms grown on five glass slides 210 75 4 mm per slide from one channel i e one biological replicate were scraped off the glass slides and combined to form a stock suspension in artificial river water i e periquil stewart et al 2015 standardization to similar biomass concentrations was done by optical density od measurements at 685 nm and by further diluting samples with higher biomass from these stock suspensions subsamples of 120 ml 110 ml and 120 ml were taken for the biotransformation experiment bt a sorption control sc and a biological control bc respectively bc batches were used to investigate the influence of the spiked mps on biofilm growth additionally abiotic controls ac consisting of only artificial river water were prepared sc and ac batches were autoclaved 121 c 2 bar 20 min before the start of the experiment the experiments were conducted at 16 c bt and bc batches were exposed to a 12 h light dark cycle philips 10nc mas ledtube

to each bt sc and ac experimental vessel resulting in a final concentration of approximately 1 μg l of each substance table s1 while the bc batches were spiked with the same amount of pure etoh all experimental vessels were placed on laboratory shakers and shaken circularly at 150 rpm aqueous samples 1 5 ml of the bt batches were taken before and at approximately 0 1 2 4 8 24 48 72 and 96 hours after the start of the experiment while samples of the sc and ac batches were taken before and at approximately 0 4 24 48 and 72 hours after the start of the experiment samples were centrifuged 15 min 4 c 21 130 g the supernatant 1 ml was transferred into an amber hplc vial spiked with 20 μl internal standard mix to a concentration of 0 5 μg l and then immediately frozen 20 c until analysis biofilm samples for determining solid phase concentrations were taken from the stock suspensions before the start of the experiment and at 48 and 96 h after the start of the experiment for the bt batches and at 48 and 72 h for the sc batches in exp 1 and at 24 48 and 96 h for the bt batches and at 24 48 and 72 h for the sc batches in exp 2 respectively to do so 10 ml of the suspension were sampled centrifuged 15 min 23 c 3 800 g the supernatant discarded and the pellet frozen 80 c until further extraction 2 6 biofilm extraction in order to determine solid phase concentrations the quechers extraction method described in desiante et al 2021 was used briefly lyophilized biofilm samples were spiked with a mix of isotope labelled standards to correct for losses during extraction sample processing and measurement acn ultrapure h2o were then added to the sample to result upon phase separation in an acn extract which was stored at 20 c until evaporation under n2 consecutively the residue was redissolved in 1000 µl ultrapure h2o and measured by means of mass spectrometry further information on evaluation of solid phase concentrations can be found in si section s2 1 2 7 wwtp sampling during the biofilm colonization phase of exp 1 a three day time proportional composite sample of the wwtp influent was taken between 8th 11th of july 2019 and a four day composite sample of the effluent between 7th 11th of july 2019 during exp 2 three weekly time proportional composite samples of the wwtp influent effluent and the ultrafiltered effluent were taken between 11th of february 10th of march 2020 which were later combined to three week composite samples after sampling the samples were immediately frozen 20 c before hrms analysis the samples were allowed to thaw at 4 c overnight 10 ml subsampled into 15 ml centrifuge tubes and centrifuged 20 c 3800 g 15 min from these 1 ml subsamples were pipetted into amber hplc vials and spiked with 20 µl of the internal standard mix further information on the wwtp and evaluation of wwtp samples can be found in si section s3 2 8 micropollutant analysis in order to determine chemical concentrations the same procedure as described in desiante et al 2021 was used briefly reverse phase liquid chromatography coupled to a qexactive plus thermo scientific was used to gather positive and negative full scan ms spectra samples taken at 0 h after spiking were measured three times technical triplicates for every biological replicate micropollutant data analysis was performed according to desiante et al 2021 target quantification for the 75 study compounds was done using the software tracefinder 4 1 thermo scientific technical triplicate measurements were used to calculate the analytical error of the measurements further data evaluation of experimental data was conducted in r version 3 6 1 r core team 2017 figures of concentration time series were produced using the package ggplot2 wickham 2016 concentration time series were used to calculate first order rate constants kbio for every single biological replicate assuming pseudo first order kinetics which were then averaged in order to obtain kbio values for the investigated treatments see tables s2 and s3 for kbio values of biotransformed compounds r2 was used as quality indicator of the fit for visualization linear regression models were fitted to the log transformed values of the normalized data c c0 i e the measured concentration divided by the starting concentration including all replicates n 4 of each treatment concentration time series of all evaluated study compounds and linear regression plots for the study compounds that have been primarily biotransformed are displayed in figures s7 and s8 solid phase concentrations measured in biofilm samples were used to evaluate mass balances figures s9 and s10 based on these dominant fate processes were assigned to each compound as described in desiante et al 2021 si section s2 1 in order to compare biotransformation trends across the biotransformed chemicals and the biofilm communities we level normalized the calculated kbio for each chemical across treatments and created heatmaps using the r package pheatmap kolde 2015 van den berg et al 2006 2 9 bacterial abundance quantification by flow cytometry during the biofilm colonization phase of exp 2 six samples for flow cytometry were taken from the treated wastewater buffer tank ww and directly after ultrafiltration uf on day two nine 16 19 21 and 23 after starting the colonization during the biotransformation experiments exp 1 and exp 2 samples of the bt and bc batches were taken right before spiking and at 48 and 96 h the sample processing and measurements were conducted in the same way as described in desiante et al 2021 briefly 5 ml of the samples were fixated with 5 ml buffer solution 4 paraformaldehyde 0 2 sodium pyrophosphate in glass vials and stored at 4 c after ultrasonication 4 20s the samples were diluted stained with 1 sybr green 1 100 dilution in dmso and incubated at 37 c for 10 min measurements were conducted on a bd accuri c6 flow cytometer bd accuri san jose ca usa flow cytometry data processing and analysis was done with the bd accuritm c6 analysis software obtained total cell counts were used for graphical representation in r version 3 6 1 with the package ggplot2 r core team 2017 wickham 2016 for bacterial abundance time patterns please see si sections s2 3 and s2 4 2 10 total biomass quantification ash free dry mass afdm sampling for total biomass quantification was done prior to and after 96 h in exp 1 and after 48 and 96 h in exp 2 for the bt and bc respectively to do so 10 ml of the suspension were filtered over pre equilibrated and pre weighed 47 mm glass microfiber filters gf f grade whatman maidstone united kingdom filters were dried in a ventilated oven 105 c and allowed to equilibrate in a desiccator before weighing again in order to determine the dry mass filters were then wrapped in aluminum foil muffled 80 min heating up to 450 c 1h at 450 c cool down allowed to equilibrate and weighed again in order to determine the weight of the mineral residues total biomass i e afdm data analysis was done according to standard procedure the determined weight of the mineral residues was subtracted from the determined dry mass in order to obtain the afdm the determined afdm values were used for graphical representation in r version 3 6 1 with the package ggplot2 r core team 2017 wickham 2016 for total biomass growth patterns please see si sections s2 3 and s2 4 2 11 data analysis and statistics in order to assess how much the treatment or the biomass expressed as bacterial abundance or total biomass accounted for the variability in kbio across the different biofilm communities we compared the predictive performance r2 of different linear regressions models for the logarithmized kbio log kbio we fitted linear regressions with treatment cells and afdm as explanatory variables in the following combinations model treatment cells afdm 1 x x 2 x 3 x x 4 x 5 x where treatment stands for one of the nine individual treatments of both exp 1 and exp 2 cells for the bacterial abundance at 0 h determined by flow cytometry for individual biological replicates n 4 9 and afdm for the total biomass at 0 h for individual biological replicates n 4 9 we then compared goodness of fit r2 between the models if the difference in r2 between a model containing both treatment and biomass compared to a model containing only one of the explanatory variables is small we can conclude that the respective single explanatory variable i e treatment cells or afdm explained the larger part of the variability in the model with two explanatory variables and vice versa for large differences in r2 in order to assess the individual contribution of treatment and cells to the model containing both of these explanatory variables we compared r2 of model 1 with r2 of models 2 and 5 analogously to assess the individual contribution of treatment and afdm to the model containing both of these explanatory variables we compared r2 of model 3 with r2 of models 4 and 5 thus we were able to separate the effect of treatment from the effect of biomass for graphs visualizing models 2 4 and 5 and a table containing the calculated r2 values for all models see si section 2 2 models were fitted using r version 3 6 1 r core team 2017 2 12 16s rrna amplicon sequencing total genomic dna was extracted from an aliquot of 2 ml from each biofilm suspension after 4 weeks of colonization and from 100 ml ww samples taken regularly 12 sampling times during biofilm colonization by using the dneasy powerbiofilm kit qiagen following the manufacturer s instructions the biofilm samples were centrifuged at 14 000 g for 30 min at 4 c and the pellets stored at 80 c until their analyses the sampling of wastewater during exp 1 is described in carles et al 2021 during exp 2 composite wastewater samples were taken regularly and immediately filtered on supor polyethersulfone membrane disc filters with 0 2 µm pore size pall corporation usa the filters were stored at 80 c and cut in small pieces prior to dna extraction the library construction consisted in a two step pcr process briefly the first pcr amplified the v3 v4 region of the 16s rrna gene using the primer set described by herlemann et al 2011 the second pcr was carried out to add multiplexing indices and illumina sequencing adapters the libraries were then normalized pooled and sequenced paired end 2 300 nt illumina miseq following the manufacture s run protocols illumina inc all raw sequences are available at the national center for biotechnology information ncbi under the sra accession ids prjna699298 exp 1 and prjna755072 exp 2 sequencing data processing amplicon sequence variants asvs binning and taxonomic assignment were done according to carles et al 2021 briefly the reads were checked for quality and end trimmed by using fastqc v0 11 2 andrews 2010 and seqtk https github com lh3 seqtk respectively and then merged using flash v1 2 11 magoč and salzberg 2011 the primers were trimmed by using cutadapt v1 12 martin 2011 quality filtering was performed with prinseq lite v0 20 4 with a subsequent size and gc selection step schmieder and edwards 2011 the reads were processed with an amplicon sequence variants asv analysis callahan et al 2017 the sample reads were first denoised into asvs with unoise3 in the usearch software v 11 0 667 the final predicted taxonomic assignments were performed with silva v128 by using sintax in the usearch software v 11 0 667 edgar 2016 the total number of reads obtained at each bioinformatics step is reported in table s5 an untargeted sequencing data analysis was performed in order to identify taxa that were transferred from the wwtp into biofilms and whose abundance patterns followed the downstream effect observed in the biodegradation experiments the selection was based on the following criteria see si section s4 for the details 1 the asvs detected in biofilm at the end of the colonization period were also found in the wastewater effluent exp 1 2 2 their abundance was significantly higher in 80 ww biofilms than in control exp1 2 3 they were detected in both experiments and 4 their abundance was significantly reduced by ultrafiltration exp 2 applying these criteria we selected a total of 135 and 146 taxa from exp 1 and 2 respectively figure s31 additionally a targeted analysis was also carried out to identify taxa with high sequence similarity to species previously reported to degrade compounds showing the downstream effect more information on methods and results of the targeted analysis are provided in the si section s4 3 results 3 1 biotransformation of specific mps depends on proportion of ww in the first set of experiments exp 1 biofilms grown at four different treatment conditions 0 10 30 and 80 nominal treated wastewater ww concentration in the receiving channels were used to conduct biotransformation batch experiments with the 75 study compounds experimental performance has already been evaluated and discussed in carles et al 2021 and is summarized in si section s1 4 of the 75 study compounds 38 were predominantly biotransformed rather than mostly sorbed or bioaccumulated see si section s2 1 1 for those we calculated biotransformation rate constants kbio by fitting a first order kinetic model to their concentration time series see fig 1 for the examples of acesulfame and caffeine and figures s7 and s8 for the remaining compounds the calculated kbio values for all 38 biotransformed compounds are given in tables s2 and s3 in exp 1 for the example of acesulfame no significant concentration decrease was observed in the 0 and 10 ww treatments while we saw a sudden onset of biotransformation in the 30 ww treatment and an even faster removal of the compound in the 80 ww treatment fig 1a a similar pattern of increasing biotransformation with increasing proportion of ww was also observed for the compound caffeine which however was already biotransformed to some extent in the control biofilms 0 ww fig 1a besides acesulfame and caffeine nine more out of the 38 biotransformed compounds i e the artificial sweeteners cyclamate and saccharin the insect repellent deet and the pharmaceuticals cilastatin eprosartan furosemide ketoprofen levetiracetam and valsartan showed a similar pattern of increased biotransformation at increased amounts of ww albeit the exact onset of increased biotransformation in terms of ww differed between compounds si section s2 1 6 3 2 ultrafiltration prevents the downstream effect to distinguish the effect of increased mp concentrations from the potential influence of microorganisms released with the treated ww the second set of experiments exp 2 included treatments at 30 and 80 ww in which the treated ww was subjected to ultrafiltration uf before being fed into the flow through channels this resulted in biofilms grown for four weeks at five different treatment conditions 0 ww 30 ww 30 uf 80 ww and 80 uf where uf stands for ww that has additionally been passed through the uf unit these biofilms were then again used in batch experiments to study biotransformation of the 75 study compounds experimental performance of exp 2 is discussed in si s1 5 analysis of concentration time series and resulting rate constants from exp 2 revealed a number of striking patterns we found that seven out of the eleven compounds having shown a dependence on the proportion of ww in exp 1 i e acesulfame caffeine cyclamate deet levetiracetam saccharin and valsartan exhibited strong responses to the uf treatment i e a reduction of the average kbio for those seven compounds from 4 2 and 4 0 day 1 in the 30 and 80 ww treatments to 0 8 and 0 4 day 1 in the 30 and 80 uf treatments compared to 0 6 day 1 in the 0 ww control treatment this is again exemplarily illustrated in terms of the actual concentration time series and kinetic fits for acesulfame and caffeine in fig 1b as can be seen in fig 1b acesulfame again was persistent in the control treatment 0 ww but was removed in the 30 and 80 ww treatments yet strikingly ultrafiltration 30 and 80 uf reversed this effect to the extent that no observable acesulfame biotransformation occurred in the uf treatments a similar pattern was found for caffeine while it was removed to a small degree in the control higher removal was observed in the ww samples but ultrafiltration 30 and 80 uf prevented the effect of ww to similar levels of removal as observed in the control these results suggest that the downstream effect must result from particle bound traits that are released by the wwtp yet filtered out by ultrafiltration in exp 2 as the pore size of the ultrafiltration membrane ranges around 0 4 µm it is highly unlikely that dna fragments are removed in this step but rather bacteria and larger sludge particles 3 3 treatment not biomass amount dictates biotransformation potential of compounds showing the downstream effect in order to control for effects of biomass and treatment conditions on biotransformation we determined total biomass and bacterial abundance in the biofilm suspensions prepared for the biotransformation experiments fig 2 for the biofilm suspensions prepared for exp 1 we determined a mean total biomass afdm of 0 66 0 12 g l across all biofilms at the beginning of the experiment fig 2a and a mean bacterial biomass of 179 47 cells nl fig 2b in exp 1 biomass was comparable between treatments and no dependence of biomass with increasing ww percentage was observable in exp 2 the mean total biomass and bacterial abundance was 1 03 0 15 g l and 276 67 cells nl respectively here a trend towards higher biomass in non filtered versus ultrafiltered treatments was discernible however statistical analysis comparing the relative importance of biomass and treatment on kbio confirmed that treatment conditions explained most of the variability in the rate constants for the chemicals showing the downstream effect while biomass differences played only a minor role si section s2 2 we also compared biomass dynamics over the course of the experiments between the different treatments and between biotransformation bt batches and unspiked biological controls bc see si sections s2 3 and s2 4 we found that biomass was dynamic but that dynamics were comparable between the treatments within experiments and between spiked and unspiked batches in both experiments 3 4 mps with highest influent concentrations typically showed highest removal in wwtp in order to compare the removal of mps in the wwtp to the biotransformation potential in the biofilms we monitored influent and effluent concentrations of the study compounds in the wwtp producing the treated effluent for our experiments fig 3 lower panel based on these data we calculated the percentage removal of the compounds that were found in measurable concentrations in the influent fig 3 upper panel and si section s3 interestingly the compounds that were removed to the highest extent 80 during wastewater treatment also were amongst those exhibiting the highest influent concentrations 1000 ng l indeed only a few compounds with comparably high influent concentrations i e 4 5 methyl benzotriazole benzotriazole and diclofenac in both experiments and acesulfame and deet in exp 2 did not show removals 80 however it is to note that acesulfame and deet still were removed by 77 and 59 during wastewater treatment in exp 2 respectively while the first three mps were fully persistent during wastewater treatment in exp 1 and showed removal of only 39 57 and 29 in exp 2 respectively within the study compounds the majority of mps with influent concentrations 1000 ng l were removed to a lesser extent i e 80 during wastewater treatment with the exception of mefenamic acid exp 1 mianserin exp 1 trifloxystrobin exp 1 and ranitidine exp 2 however the measured concentrations of the last three were close to their respective loq and their calculated removal thus highly uncertain leaving mefenamic acid as the sole clear exception with removal 80 despite an influent concentration 1000 ng l for our study compounds 3 5 identification of taxa aligning with downstream effect sequencing of the 16s rrna gene was performed for biomass sampled from biofilms and ww from both experiments taxa present in ww and differently abundant in a given treatment compared to the control 0 ww were selected from the 16s dataset of exp 1 figure s31 we found 184 taxa originating from ww that followed a pattern of higher abundance with higher amounts of ww in exp 2 we found 202 taxa that also showed an increasing pattern with increasing ww but which relative to the 0 ww control were not significantly more abundant in the uf treatments figure s31 combining these two datasets lead to a final list of 146 taxa originating from wastewater whose abundance patterns followed the patterns in kbio for the mps showing the downstream effect fig 4 for a complete list of these taxa see table appendix a8 4 discussion with this study we aimed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying observations of increased mp biotransformation for a number of chemicals in biofilms grown downstream of wwtp outfalls relative to upstream biofilms downstream effect so far our results clearly demonstrate that 1 the downstream effect is reproducible under controlled conditions and scaled with the percentage of ww in exp 1 2 ultrafiltration i e removal of particles and microorganisms deriving from the wwtp prevented the downstream effect in exp 2 3 biotransformation was dictated by the microbial community composition i e the treatment condition rather than only by bacterial abundance in the batch experiments 4 with very few exceptions compounds that were removed to the highest extent 80 in the wwtp also exhibited the highest influent concentrations 1000 ng l 5 146 bacterial taxa showed abundance patterns that are consistent with the downstream effect by combining these key results a nuanced picture emerges fig 5 as can be seen in fig 5 we identified three major clusters a b and c of mp biotransformation patterns based on the level normalized kbio values obtained for the different biofilm communities cluster a which contained 26 and hence the majority of the 38 biotransformed compounds was least influenced by the treatment conditions it contained the majority of compounds that had not shown a downstream effect in our previous study and whose biotransformation seemed to largely align with bacterial abundance trends in our previous data desiante et al 2021 this is in agreement with the fact that cluster a contains mostly compounds that are thought to be biotransformed by enzymes that are ubiquitous among living organisms or enzymes that are closely related to bacterial growth achermann et al 2018a achermann et al 2018b desiante et al 2021 johnson et al 2015 all taken together the findings from this and our previous study desiante et al 2021 point toward co metabolism the transformation of a non growth substrate in the obligate presence of a growth substrate or another transformable compound as the major biotransformation process for these compounds dalton and stirling 1982 cluster a was separated from clusters b and c which both contain compounds that showed a clear downstream effect in exp 1 fig 5 of those cluster b contains those seven compounds that show no downstream effect upon ultrafiltration in exp 2 while cluster c contains five compounds that actually were removed on average to the highest extent in the 80 uf treatment in exp 2 as can be seen from the information on influent concentrations and removal in the wwtp added as annotations in fig 5 all of the compounds in cluster b were present in high concentrations 1000 ng l in the influent to the wwtp and were removed to a large extent 80 during wastewater treatment interestingly the five compounds previously shown to exhibit a downstream effect in natural streams i e acesulfame cyclamate deet levetiracetam and saccharin are all contained in cluster b desiante et al 2021 we also note that diclofenac the only compound with high influent concentrations but removal 80 in both exp 1 and exp 2 does not fall into cluster b combining all evidence from exp 1 and exp 2 suggests that the increased biotransformation capacity of the biofilms with increased percentage of wastewater i e the downstream effect observed for cluster b compounds is most likely caused directly by bacteria or larger aggregates thereof being released from the wwtp with the treated effluent in principle there are at least two mechanisms how this could influence the biotransformation capacity of the biofilms i the microorganisms being released with treated effluent capable of degrading the mps in cluster b may either directly colonize the biofilms or ii their biotransformation traits may be transferred to other microorganisms growing in the biofilms by e g horizontal gene transfer based on the 16s data rrna data we identified 146 taxa that were present in ww showed increasing abundances in biofilms with increasing ww proportion and were filtered out by ultrafiltration these findings confirmed that there are indeed bacterial taxa originating from the wwtp that can establish in biofilms growing downstream of wwtps as previously shown carles et al 2021 chonova et al 2019 mußmann et al 2013 more importantly these taxa exhibited relative abundance patterns across exp 1 and exp 2 that follow patterns of relative biotransformation rate constants for compounds showing the downstream effect i e cluster b compounds consequently it may be speculated that some of these taxa were involved in the degradation of cluster b compounds it is now interesting to further note that the compounds in cluster b exclusively exhibit both high influent concentrations to and high removal in the wwtp in combination with the fact that the capacity to degrade these compounds in biofilms is dependent on ww borne particles filtered out by ultrafiltration our results therefore suggest that the downstream effect is not only caused by microorganisms originating from the wwtp but that these microorganisms have adapted to biotransform the specific compounds in cluster b which reach the wwtp in comparably high concentrations of 1000 ng l with respect to the main aim of this study i e to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the increased mp biotransformation potential of biofilms grown downstream of wwtps we can therefore further conclude that the downstream effect is mostly due to those adapted microorganisms integrating into downstream biofilms and or transfering their increased biotransformation capacity to the biofilms in turn at least for compounds in cluster b this falsifies the hypothesis that elevated mp concentrations from wwtp effluents and in situ adaptation in the river itself explain the increased biotransformation in downstream biofilms it needs to be noted though that the biofilm colonization period in our experiments was only four weeks while the biofilms did reach a mature stage during that time time series experiments would be required to definitely exclude any long term effects of in stream exposure to mps on the downstream biofilms biodegradation capacity in support of our interpretation evolutionary adaptation of bacteria in wwtps has been previously shown for the compound acesulfame whose biotransformation during activated sludge treatment suddenly emerged around the year 2010 while it has previously been considered a conservative tracer compound castronovo et al 2017 kahl et al 2018 kleinsteuber et al 2019 also evidence from previous field studies in combination with the fact that the compounds in cluster b are commonly amongst the best removed compounds in different wwtps confirms that the phenomenon at least for some of the compounds is observable across different wwtps and downstream river environments buerge et al 2009 castronovo et al 2017 coll et al 2020 desiante et al 2021 gurke et al 2015 margot et al 2015 seller et al 2020 moreover having performed the two experiments in different seasons i e summer 2019 and late winter 2020 confirms that our findings are also robust on a temporal scale an interesting follow up question that arises from our observations is how this adaptation occurred in the wwtp in the first place and why exactly for the seven compounds in cluster b is it mostly due to the high influent concentrations that part of the activated sludge microbial consortium have adapted to and use as steady sources of carbon or other nutrients or to what extent is it related to the chemical structures of the compounds e g by all of those compounds sharing certain metabolic pathways as can be seen from fig 6 there is no single functional group that unites all of these compounds yet they all contain either an amide or sulfonamide substructure that could potentially be hydrolyzed by enzymes belonging to the amidohydrolase family while to the best of our knowledge enzymatic reaction mechanisms that are involved in the biotransformation of these compounds in stream biofilms have not yet been investigated there are several studies investigating reaction pathways and enzymes involved in the biotransformation of these compounds in pure or enrichment cultures fig 6 for acesulfame for instance there is evidence for full catabolic biodegradation in activated sludge castronovo et al 2017 enriched microbial consortia as well as isolated bacterial species of the genera bosea and chelatococcus huang et al 2021 kleinsteuber et al 2019 and it has been suggested that the pathway involves formation of sulfamic acid and acetoacetate through sequential action of a sulfohydrolase and an amidohydrolase enzyme kleinsteuber et al 2019 cyclamate has been shown to be transformed by the enzyme cyclamate sulfamatase extracted from pseudomonas sp to form cyclohexylamine and sulfate nimura et al 1974 in contrast to these initial hydrolytic transformations for the other compounds mostly initial oxidative transformations haven been reported saccharin has been proposed to be biotransformed to the compound catechol in a two step process involving the enzyme saccharin dioxygenase in sphingomonas xenophaga skn schleheck and cook 2003 for the biotransformation of deet three enzymatic pathways were suggested involving a hydrolase encoded on a gene found in pseudomonas putida dtb and a monooxygenase and a dehydrogenase pathway helbling et al 2010b rivera cancel et al 2007 for caffeine two pathways have been proposed the first involving demethylases found in plants bacteria and fungi and the second involving a caffeine 1 3 7 trimethylxanthine oxidase from klebsiella and rhodococcus hakil et al 1998 madyastha et al 1999 mazzafera 2004 while for valsartan and levetiracetam no pure or enrichment culture data detailing involved enzymes or taxa are available transformation product analysis from activated sludge studies suggests that valsartan transformation is primarily initiated through oxidative n dealkylation whereas the primary amide levetiracetam is primarily enzymatically hydrolyzed helbling et al 2010a overall the pathway information gathered so far does not support the notion of a shared initial biotransformation reaction for the seven compounds in cluster b which is further supported by the fact that the onset of biotransformation is observed at different percentages of ww in exp 1 for the different compounds in turn this suggests the elevated wwtp influent concentrations as possible alternative explanation for the adaptation to degrade cluster b compounds indeed concepts of wwtp biotechnology stipulate that the growth rate needs to exceed the loss rate i e from withdrawal of excess sludge and with the effluent for bacteria with a specific metabolic capacity to establish in an activated sludge process since growth rates of specific degraders depend on substrate concentration it has been proposed as early as in 1994 that percentage removal in wwtps and half lives in downstream aquatic environments can be predicted based on influent concentrations blok 1994 however only very recently a correlation between biotransformation rate constants in wwtps and wwtp influent concentrations has actually been demonstrated based on monitoring data for a large and diverse set of mps nolte et al 2020 also more recent data from studies using compound specific isotope analysis experimentally demonstrated that mass transfer limitations may prevent catabolic degradation of mps below a certain concentration limit in the low µg l range kundu et al 2019 sun et al 2021 this is consistent with earlier studies on the concentration dependence of biodegradation kinetics of two herbicides that revealed a threshold of approximately 1 10 µg l above which growth of specific degrader biomass was observed toräng et al 2003 in our study the data suggests that the concentration limit for compounds showing the downstream effect lies in the range of 1 µg l yet at the same time there was also one compound reaching the wwtp in concentrations above 1 µg l that did not show high removal in the wwtp i e diclofenac and consistently also did not show a downstream effect confirming that concentration limits for metabolic degradation are substrate specific and or that certain compounds may be fully recalcitrant to biodegradation even at high concentrations schwarzenbach et al 2005 the lack of high wwtp influent concentrations and their lower removal in the wwtp might also offer a key to understanding the deviating behavior of compounds in cluster c while they show a downstream effect this effect is not removed through ultrafiltration at least not at 80 ww contrasting this with cluster b behavior these findings suggest that mechanisms other than the release of adapted degrader bacteria must underlie the downstream effect for cluster c compounds indeed for these compounds observations are more consistent with a direct effect of in stream exposure to mps on the periphyton overall our results suggest that community composition drives the biotransformation patterns we observed for cluster b compounds to shed some more light on what specific taxa might potentially be involved in biodegrading individual cluster b compounds we searched the 146 taxa whose abundance patterns align with the downstream effect for high sequence similarity with species previously reported to degrade compounds showing the downstream effect see table s6 and si section s4 one notable finding from this analysis was a taxon annotated as sm1a02 from the family phycisphaeraceae whose abundance pattern was fully consistent with the rate constant pattern of cluster b compounds and which showed strong and significant fold changes between 0 and 80 ww in exp 1 and 2 log2 fold change 4 table appendix a8 these taxa have been shown to dominate acesulfame degrading communities enriched from the activated sludge of six municipal wastewater treatment plants huang et al 2021 and bioreactors with emerging acesulfame degradation capacity unpublished data recent sequencing data also reported on the presence of putative sulfohydrolase genes in microalgae associated phycisphaeraceae sp thus confirming the potential role of sm1a02 in acesulfame degradation in biofilm communities rambo et al 2020 these results support the notion that some of the 146 taxa revealed through pattern analysis indeed may be involved in degradation of compounds from cluster b yet such hypotheses emerging from the data still need to be confirmed by complementary approaches such as culture isolation methods and identification quantification of functional genes related to biodegradation processes 5 conclusions two major implications arise from the results of our study first we provide clear experimental evidence that non disinfected wwtp effluents change an ecological function of downstream biofilms in this case their biotransformation potential while this seems overall beneficial in the case of biotransformation since it contributes to lowering exposure to mps in biofilms and hence in the overall stream environment it raises the question what other functional changes might occur in biofilms exposed to treated ww for instance our results which demonstrate the transfer of bacteria adapted to degrade mps from the wwtp into stream biofilms and the establishment of that degradation capacity in those biofilms suggest that it is likely that transfer of resistant bacteria and or resistance genes also support the transfer of ar factors from wwtps into biofilms abe et al 2020 balcázar 2018 marti et al 2013 woegerbauer et al 2020 similarly another resistance mechanism i e pollution induced community tolerance of biofilms against mps has previously been shown to be elevated downstream of wwtps corcoll et al 2014 tlili et al 2016 tlili et al 2017 and to increase with increasing proportions of ww especially for the phototrophic compartment of biofilm communities carles et al 2021 it has been hypothesized that the increased tolerance is caused by the mps released with the wwtp effluents exerting a selective pressure on downstream communities resulting in the extinction of sensitive and establishment of tolerant species however our results support a second plausible hypothesis i e that the increase in tolerance in downstream biofilms might be due to integration of already tolerant species released with the ww or more indirectly due to changes in the biofilm communities that endow increased tolerance to the phototrophic community members through yet unknown mechanisms second our study revealed distinct differences in mp degradation patterns amongst biofilms grown with different proportions of non disinfected ww for compounds potentially undergoing metabolic degradation versus those more likely undergoing co metabolic biotransformation the type of mesocosm experiments introduced here could therefore become a useful tool to distinguish co metabolically from metabolically degraded compounds in a highly environmentally relevant setting this will allow studying questions of fundamental interest in environmental chemistry such as how molecular structure influences which compounds can be metabolically degraded in the environment and at what concentrations or which families of microbes are most likely to be involved in such metabolic degradation such information is essential in order to design compounds that are readily biodegradable in a river environment

16063,this work presents a mathematical method to describe adsorptive removal of organic micropollutants omps and dissolved organic carbon doc from wastewater treatment plant effluent using powdered activated carbon pac the developed model is based on the tracer model trm as a modification of the ideal adsorbed solution theory iast and uses the fictive component approach for organic matter fractionation it enables the simulation of multisolute adsorption of omps considering competitive adsorption behavior of organic background compounds obc adsorption equilibrium data for doc and seven different omps as well as kinetic data for doc were derived from batch experiments performed with secondary clarifier effluent of two municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtp 1 and wwtp 2 two conventional pac products were investigated as well as one biogenic pac biopac verification and validation of the fitting results based on operational data of wwtp 1 showed promising prediction of doc and omp removal efficiency however when applied to a static simulation of a full scale pac adsorption stage the model overpredicts the removal efficiency of sulfamethoxazole and candesartan for benzotriazole carbamazepine or hydrochlorothiazide predicted removal falls below operational removal the model can be used to predict removals of good adsorbable omps but fails to accurately predict the removals of omps with variable or low pac affinity the model was further used for a dynamic simulation of doc and diclofenac effluent concentrations of a full scale pac adsorption stage with varying operating conditions and influent concentrations results show that the hydraulic retention time hrt in the contact reactor is a decisive operational parameter for omp removal efficiency

wwtps are considered to be a major point source for the emission of anthropogenic organic micropollutants omps such as pharmaceutical residues hormones personal care products detergents into the aquatic environment in recent years there is growing concern and interest in the installation of advanced treatment technologies for the removal of omps at wwtps loos et al 2013 currently ozonation and adsorption using powdered activated carbon pac or granular activated carbon gac are the technologies that are widely studied and implemented in pilot and full scale plants boehler et al 2012 hollender et al 2009 the process selection mainly depends on local conditions involving consideration of multiple factors in a cost benefit analysis margot et al 2013 to select the most suitable treatment technology it is necessary to estimate the potential omp removal as precisely as possible in order to do that predictive mathematical adsorption models are needed mathematical models are able to represent the essential aspects of the adsorptive removal processes via relationships and variables which assists a better understanding of processes and enables to predict process behavior in literature different mathematical models for adsorption of omps and dissolved organic matter onto pac in wastewater matrices are studied in order to gather information about adsorption equilibrium of different adsorbates or to qualify interactions between different adsorbates some of the most important models for multisolute adsorption are summarized in the following passages competitive adsorption can be described by the ideal adsorbed solution theory iast which allows predicting the multicomponent adsorption from single solute isotherm parameters worch 2021 the drawbacks of iast approach is that by using single solute isotherm parameters it fails to model the interactions and competition between omps and organic background concentration obc multisolute adsorption effects such as interactions between adsorbate and adsorbent different omp and obc accessibilities to adsorbent micropores or effects of pore blockage are not considered this leads to a general overestimation of competitive adsorption effects of doc worch 2021 furthermore the iast requires detailed knowledge of solution composition and high experimental effort in terms of single solute isotherm parameters of all omps and obcs in order to overcome the described problems two iast modifications were developed which are equivalent background compound model ebcm najm et al 1991 and tracer model trm burwig et al 1995 rabolt et al 1998 ebcm assumes one equivalent background compound ebc as competing adsorbate for each omp leaving all omp data concentration single solute isotherm parameter unchanged the trm modification enables the correction of single solute isotherm parameters of the omp in the presence of obc for further application in the iast however since the different constituents of the organic matter present in water or wastewater are very hard to be identified and only total isotherms can be measured experimentally using collective parameters such as doc iast precondition of known solution composition is not fulfilled one solution to the issue is to use what is known as the fictive component approach or adsorption analysis crittenden et al 1985 worch 1989 this approach allows the characterization of doc composition based on adsorbability and the transformation of the unknown mixture into a certain number of fictive components zietzschmann et al 2016 modeled the competitive adsorption between omps and background organic matter by modifying iast using the ebcm for each omp an individual ebc was set considering all observed competition effects a simplified approach of iast ebc model was also used by shimabuku et al 2017 to compare competitive adsorption in deionized and stormwater on pulverized gac trm replaces single solute omp isotherm parameters in iast with the corrected parameters in the presence of obc after determination of different fictive obc fractions using the fictive component approach the main advantage of trm compared to ebcm is its simplicity as there is no need to add new ebc fractions for each omp furthermore adsorption of obc and omp can also be modeled parallelly which is not possible in ebcm worch 2010 compared trm and ebcm approaches and reported that trm is advantageous due to these reasons however only few attempts of simulation using iast modified by trm were found in literature viegas et al 2020 predicted the adsorption of carbamazepine diclofenac and sulfamethoxazole on a carob waste derived activated powdered biochar modeling was based on a four component approach consisting of three omp and total doc without fractionation however viegas et al 2020 studied the adsorption equilibrium and isotherm of the omps without considering adsorption kinetics therefore their model could not perform dynamic simulation with varying operational parameters such as pac dose and hydraulic retention time hrt nowotny et al 2007 modeled adsorption competition between organic matter and omp onto powdered and granulated activated carbon in terms of isotherm parameter fitting using the tracer model trm the single solute freundlich parameters k and n were fitted for each omp and doc fraction leading to an overdetermined system in which several combinations of parameters might give the same goodness of fit and therefore reduce equifinality acevedo et al 2021 focused on adsorption and biodegradation of organic matter inside gac filtration and used the fictive component approach together with an iast based data fitting routine to determine adsorption dynamics of doc with gac however modeling of omp removal was not part of the study of acevedo et al 2021 to the best of the authors knowledge an iast trm model which combines both adsorption isotherms and adsorption kinetics to simulate removal of omps in wastewater matrix has not been developed yet this paper presents thus for the first time a simplified model variation of iast trm that considers not only the removal efficiency for different omps but also the significance of adsorption kinetics by pac in real wastewater it investigates the adsorption performance of pac by applying a mathematical model to steady state and dynamic simulation of a full scale pac treatment stage with use of multisolute experimental data for the correction of single solute doc and omp isotherms the model requires only a limited amount of data sets respectively experimental effort in terms of model calibration the kinetic simulation step in the model allows dynamic simulation of different operational scenarios the developed adsorption model fosters thus better understanding of omp removal by adsorption onto pac 2 model development 2 1 adsorption equilibrium the developed model is based on the tracer model trm as a modification of the ideal adsorbed solution theory iast considering competitive adsorption of omp and obc generally different single solute isotherm models can be used for the iast the model developed in this work is

k f i freundlich constant g g g m³ n n i freundlich exponent it is assumed that doc is an appropriate sum parameter for organic background components based on the adsorption analysis crittenden et al 1985 the heterogenous character of obc is considered by four different doc fractions non 0 poorly 1 moderately 2 and well 3 adsorbable fraction each with a different value for the freundlich coefficient k f as shown in table s10 in this model approach the adsorption constants k f 1 and k f 3 for the poor and the good adsorbable doc fractions respectively are related to the medium adsorbable doc constant k f 2 as it reduces the number of unknown mathematical variables k f 1 was assumed to be half k f 2 and k f 3 twice k f 2 from the model s point of view each doc fraction except the non adsorbable doc as well as the total omp concentration is furthermore divided into the s fraction representing the concentration in the aqueous solution dissolved and unadsorbed and the x fraction representing the concentration in the solid phase adsorbed onto pac shown in table 1 the non adsorbable doc s 0 is identified as the remaining doc in the wastewater sample at equilibration time 48 h and at sufficiently high pac doses 500 mg l the adsorbable obc is then calculated as the difference between initial doc concentration and the non adsorbable fraction for simplification the adsorbable obc is distributed equally to three adsorbable fractions s 1 s 2 and s 3 good moderate and poor adsorbable eq 4 4 s 1 s 2 s 3 c 0 d o c s 0 3 for simplification of the calculation process only one omp at once is considered with the two fractions s o m p and x o m p and can be hence determined and fitted at the same time more omps can be added with increasing calculation effort 2 2 adsorption kinetics the adsorption rate is another important factor besides adsorption equilibrium for modeling adsorption processes as it determines when equilibrium will be reached mass transport within the adsorbent is dominated by film diffusion surface diffusion and pore diffusion film diffusion was not considered for modeling the adsorption of omp and obc on pac as it is negligible at high stirring velocities worch 2021 adsorption rate for surface and pore diffusion summarized as intraparticle mass transfer is described by a first order kinetic assuming that only the mean adsorbent loading is time dependent the first order kinetic rate is described according to eq 5 5 d q d t k 1 q e q q with q mean loading on the particle at time t g g k 1 first order rate constant s 1 q e q equilibrium loading g g considering q e q as the total amount of adsorbed omp or obc x t on pac x p a c at equilibrium q as adsorbed amount of each component x i on pac x p a c at time t and the molar

the solid phase adsorbed g m³ at equilibrium z i molar fraction of component i v first order kinetic rate constant s 1 the kinetic rate v was determined by fitting data from doc kinetic batch experiments under the use of prior fitted equilibrium results for x i and z i assuming that adsorption competition between different omps and obc implies similar adsorption behavior adsorption kinetic rate v was derived from obc and set equal for all omps this assumption however neglects differences in intraparticle mass transport of obc and the different omps but was made to reduce the need for expensive and time consuming lab experiments the kinetic rate v determined as described above is not transferable to other conditions e g other wastewater compositions or pac products worch 2021 2 3 calculation matrix a stoichiometric matrix see table 1 based on the trm theory introduces the relationship between different components as described above it can be applied in a wwtp model to calculate the concentration of doc fractions and omp at time t by mathematical description of the different processes in the reactor these include adsorption processes for the three adsorbable doc fractions as well as one omp desorption processes of all three adsorbable doc fractions and omps and the biodegradation process of omp besides adsorption into activated carbon omps can be biologically degraded in activated sludge system clara et al 2005 biodegradation of omps was implemented in the model based on joss et al 2006 but was not considered because adsorption processes are studied within a downstream pac adsorption stage contact reactor and sedimentation tank for now desorption rates were set to zero as there are currently no data available to assess these processes with r adsorption

batch experiments for two different wastewater treatment plants wwtp 1 and wwtp 2 and different pac products were performed to determine adsorption isotherms of omps and obc as well as adsorption kinetics of obc table s1 in supplementary material provides a more detailed overview the data obtained were used for fitting of freundlich isotherm parameters k f and optionally n f as well as the process rate v in order to calibrate the developed model only wwtp 1 has a full scale pac adsorption stage thus data of this plant were used for model validation and steady state dynamic simulations of a full scale pac adsorption stage 3 1 wastewater characteristics secondary clarifier effluent from two municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtp 1 725 000 pe and wwtp 2 350 000 pe was collected in stainless steel containers on dry and rain weather days containing representative concentrations of omp and doc further samples from the pac adsorption stage effluent wwtp 1 were collected directly from the settling tank effluent no further omp or doc were added to any of the samples 3 2 pac products powdered activated carbon csc pharma clean carbon service consulting gmbh co kg vettweiss germany the same pac as used in large scale operation of wwtp 1 was used for wwtp 1 samples as well as norit sae super cabot corporation norit deutschland gmbh rheinfelden germany for comparison adsorption on norit sae super and a biopac based activated carbon was investigated with wastewater from wwtp 2 the biopac based activated carbon made of residual biomass from nature conservation green cuttings was produced at 900 c using a pyrolysis and activation lab scale reactor pyreka pyreg gmbh doerth germany with water steam activation joseph et al 2020 3 3 batch adsorption experiments two different sets of batch adsorption experiments were performed for kinetic and equilibrium studies respectively for kinetic doc studies experiments were conducted with pac doses of 10 mg l and 20 mg l using contact times of each 10 30 and 60 min to establish the adsorption isotherms for both omp and obc closed flasks with secondary effluent having pac doses in the range of 0 2 5 10 20 30 50 100 300 500 1 000 3 000 and 5 000 mg l were shaken for 48 hours pac doses up to 500 mg l were achieved by pipetting adequate volumes of pac stock suspension 10 g l into secondary effluent water the preparation of the pac stock solution is described in supplementary material for batches with higher pac doses than 500 mg l pac was added directly into secondary effluent water batch experiments were conducted in triplicate in 200 ml conical flasks at room temperature wwtp 1 gerhardt gyratory shaker c gerhardt gmbh co kg königswinter germany 135 rpm wwtp 2 overhead shaker 3040 gfl lauda gfl mbh burgwedel germany 25 rpm 3 4 obc and omp analysis samples for the analyzes were collected immediately after the respective contact times and filtered through 0 45 µm regenerated cellulose filters wwtp 1 rotilabo carl roth gmbh co kg karlsruhe germany wwtp 2 sartorius minisart sartorius corporate administration gmbh goettingen germany doc measurements were performed on a shimadzu toc l cph as described by din en 1484 2019 04 for wwtp 1 and with a dimatoc 2000 dimatec analysentechnik gmbh germany for wwtp 2 organic micropollutants were determined using hplc ms ms agilent 1260 hplc system in tandem with mass spectrometer sciex api 5000 after water sample preparation with solid phase extraction 4 model application 4 1 single solute parameter fitting with iast trm the fitting process for model calibration was done in two separate steps as described by fig 1 the first step serves the slightly altered adsorption analysis as described in section 2 1 herewith the adsorption rate and the freundlich isotherm parameter for the different doc fractions were fitted with a script written in c programming language using the corrected doc isotherm parameters and process rate as well as the experimentally obtained omp equilibrium data the freundlich isotherm parameters for omp were then fitted through a second script figure s 1 and figure s 2 in supplementary material show the developed fitting model and script dialogue for the fitting of obc and omps the developed scripts accept kinetic and isotherm data as input and offer several options for the fitting i fitting of the freundlich isotherm constant k f i and the adsorption rate v ii fitting of k f i n and v iii fitting of k f i n v and the non adsorbable fraction of doc s0 however fitting more than two parameters may result in an overdetermined system with equally fitted results najm et al 1991 while creating high calculation effort it is therefore advisable to do the fitting only for k f i and v using a fixed value for n derived from practical experience and a fixed value for s0 derived from batch experiments as described above in the present work the freundlich exponent was equalized for all doc fractions and omps at n 0 3 in both scripts a mathematical solver was used to minimize the deviation between modeled and measured concentrations different algorithms for nonlinear optimization obtained from the open source library nlopt 1 1 http github com stevengj nlopt were used and tested results obtained from cobyla optimizer were used as the cobyla optimizer showed more stability and lower standard deviation see figure s 3 4 2 simulation model of a full scale pac adsorption stage the adsorption stage vcr 3 700 m³ of wwtp 1 725 000 pe treats a maximum flow of 300 l s corresponding to a minimum hrt of 30 minutes with a current average pac dose of 7 g pac m³ a simulation model for the adsorption stage of wwtp 1 using the simulation software simba 4 3 enables comparison of model results with real effluent data the model enables both steady state and dynamic simulation of omp removal with pac two different influent blocks were developed the steady state block reads average daily values for doc and omp influent concentration as well as the total wastewater inflow the dynamic block handles influent concentration and flow rate in a resolution from 2h values up to every minute data in addition full scale description of wwtp 1 by both steady state and dynamic simulation needs to consider extra omp removal stemming from coagulation effects after adding flocculants into the pac adsorption stage the simulation run assesses 10 doc removal caused by coagulation according to mailler et al 2016 who suggest a decrease of dom concentration by maximum 15 4 3 steady state simulation of omp removal operational data of five different dry weather days for the influent and effluent of the pac adsorption stage were used to validate the steady state simulation model daily values from 24h mixed samples for both influent and effluent of the pac adsorption stage were given for doc and seven different omps including benzotriazole candesartan carbamazepine diclofenac hydrochlorothiazide irbesartan metoprolol and sulfamethoxazole daily wastewater influent was in the range between 52 600 m³ d and 72 100 m³ d the pac dose was set to a constant value of 7 mg l according to real operating conditions for isotherm and kinetic data fitting prior to simulation the results from batch experiments with csc pharma clean were used in accordance with the pac product at the treatment plant freundlich k value and adsorption process rate were determined as defined in chapter 0 and inserted into the model the model was then used to predict doc and omp concentrations in the pac adsorption stage effluent and compared to real elimination performance of the pac adsorption stage 4 4 dynamic simulation of omp removal to further test the developed model as a tool for planning and process optimization a dynamic simulation was performed with operating data from wwtp 1 for a dry weather day qdw 81 000 m³ d and a rain weather day qrw 160 000 m³ d in contrast to the steady state simulation approach which is based on daily average operational data and therefore provides only information on daily average omp removal by pac adsorption the dynamic simulation considers the varying influent pattern of a wastewater treatment plant as the pac dose needed for a constant omp removal is also depending on influent concentration and the hydraulic retention time hrt in the contact reactor knowledge of the actual influent concentration and flow rate for both dry weather and rain weather days can help to optimize the use of operational resources by improving the pac dosage concept influent data of the pac adsorption stage were given in 2h intervals for doc and diclofenac concentrations and used for simulation of continuous effluent concentration of the pac adsorption stage as there are no real effluent data available for the investigated time period a dynamic validation of the model was not possible the model therefore only provides comparative results for different fictive operational states diclofenac concentrations in the influent of the pac adsorption stage ranged from 2 0 µg l to 3 5 µg l on the dry weather day and from 1 6 µg l to 2 8 µg l on the rain weather day doc was in the range of 5 6 mg l to 6 5 mg l at dry weather and 3 8 mg l to 5 9 mg l at rain weather respectively influent flow rate of the pac adsorption stage was limited to 300 l s maximum for simulation according to real operation conditions different pac doses 7 10 15 20 mg l were tested as well as the influence of the hydraulic retention time in the contact reactor as a function of the wastewater flow rate 5 results and discussion 5 1 fitting of single solute freundlich isotherm parameters in batch adsorption experiments three different pacs and seven different omps were investigated for two separate wwtp effluents both secondary clarifier effluents from wwtp 1 and wwtp 2 were treated with norit sae further experiments were carried out by either adding csc pharma clean to the effluent of wwtp 1 or biopac to the effluent of wwtp 2 table 2 the corrected freundlich isotherm parameters k f i of each doc fraction and omp obtained with the fitting process as described in chapter 0 are summarized in table 2 fig 2 shows the fitting results of doc isotherm and kinetic data the model predicts the doc equilibrium well r2 0 88 with r2 coefficient of determination calculated as one minus the ratio between residual sum of squares and total sum of squares however regarding adsorption kinetics fig 2b the model generally underestimates the remaining doc concentration at the beginning of the adsorption process but overestimates it by the end of the equilibration time 48 h except for the biopac in other words calculated pac loading of doc is higher during the first hours of adsorption process but lower after equilibration time of 48 h as compared to the measured data the variation between the measured and the simulated obc kinetic data may result from the fact that the adsorbable obcis evenly distributed to three adsorbable fractions s 1 s 2 and s 3 good moderate and poor adsorbable in this study which may not represent the reality fig 3 depicts the fitting results of four selected omps benzotriazole hydrochlorothiazide sulfamethoxazole and diclofenac measurement data for all analyzed omps are listed in table s 4 to table s 8and the fitting results for other omps are shown in figure s 4 in supplementary material values of the coefficient of determination r2 differ strongly depending on omp and pac characteristics the measured and simulated omp equilibrium concentrations at different pac doses correlate well for hydrochlorothiazide diclofenac benzotriazole metoprolol and 4 5 methylbenzotriazole fig 3 and figure s 4 for the removal of benzotriazole 0 90 r2 0 98 the mathematical model overestimates the removal especially for small pac doses up to 10 mg l see fig 3 a however the model underestimates carbamazepine removals 0 86 r2 0 94 for the same low pac doses see figure s 4 a for the removal of hydrochlorothiazide 0 45 r2 0 99 and diclofenac 0 77 r2 0 96 the mathematical model underestimates the removal especially with wwtp 1 and pac doses 10 mg l see fig 3 b and d the model well predicted removal of metoprolol and 4 5 methylbenzotriazole for wwtp1 at different pac dosages as can be seen in fig s 4 e as for sulfamethoxazole fig 3 c and candesartan figure s 4 c the model fails to predict the equilibrium concentrations where r2 strongly differs among the investigated pac products and water sample sulfamethoxazole was defined as a weak adsorbate or substance with variable low pac affinity in literature margot et al 2013 zietzschmann et al 2015 altmann et al 2015 also reported that sulfamethoxazole removal showed larger variation compared to carbamazepine and diclofenac under the same conditions the same applies for candesartan which is considered as a substance with variable or low pac affinity probably due to its negative charge and low dow decrey et al 2020 reasons behind the poor model results for poor adsorbable omps might be the simplified obc fractionation where equal fractions of organic matter with different adsorbability were assumed micropollutants with variable or low pac affinity are expected to be more affected by obc competition on adsorption sites another reason might be assuming equal adsorption kinetic rates for obc and the different omps thus neglecting the differences in intraparticle mass transfer except for benzotriazole a lower level of correlation between model and experimental data is observed for biopac in comparison to conventional pacs factors such as surface area polarity porosity and functional groups of various pacs shall be considered when evaluating the adsorption performances of conventional pacs and biopacs nielsen et al 2014 adsorption behavior of omp on biopac might be influenced by the relatively high mineral content of nature conservation biomass in conjunction with lower carbon content compared to conventional pac hensgen et al 2012 while minerals may provide favourable adsorption sites for omp specific surface area might be limited by lower carbon content similar results are drawn from fig 4 which illustrates the mean of relative difference between simulated and measured equilibrium concentrations at different pac doses estimated as mean of c i s i m c i l a b c 0 l a b at different pac doses negative values imply an overprediction of adsorption by the model i e calculating lower soluble concentration and thus higher pac loadings as compared to the results from batch experiments positive values show that the model underestimates the pac adsorption for the related omp simulation results for benzotriazole show better adsorption behavior than by experimental data for both wwtp 1 and wwtp 2 and all pac products for diclofenac the model shows an underprediction of omp removal for wwtp 1 while overpredicting the elimination rate for wwtp 2 regarding hydrochlorothiazide an underprediction can be observed for all wastewaters and pacs except for the biopac investigated with wastewater from wwtp 2 5 2 prediction of full scale omp and doc adsorption onto powdered activated carbon by steady state simulation with purpose of model validation a steady state simulation of omp removal by pac was carried out by applying the developed model approach to full scale pac adsorption stage of wwtp 1 see figure s5 in supplementary material fig 5 shows comparison between measured removal efficiency of seven omps and doc derived from measured data of wwtp 1 and simulated values on five different dry weather days both measured and simulated values refer to the omp removal of the pac adsorption stage considering the influent of pac contact reactor and effluent of pac sedimentation tank for benzotriazole irbesartan diclofenac hydrochlorothiazide and carbamazepine predicted removal falls below the measured removal within the pac adsorption stage of wwtp 1 this observation corroborates the modeling results for diclofenac and hydrochlorothiazide in batch experiments see fig 4 wwtp 1 csc contrary to batch experiments the steady state simulation underpredicts the benzotriazole removal compared to measured mean value at pac doses 10 mg l the distinctive model performance especially for benzotriazole is not yet conclusively answered the removal of sulfamethoxazole and candesartan fluctuated during the 5 separate sampling days here the model slightly overpredicts the removal efficiency referred to the mean removal derived from the measured data similar to batch experiments an unpredictable adsorption performance of omps such as sulfamethoxazole and candesartan results in poorly consistent model behavior within the pac adsorption stage of wwtp 1 5 3 prediction of full scale omp and doc adsorption onto powdered activated carbon by dynamic simulation by applying the developed model approach to a dynamic simulation of the full scale pac adsorption stage of wwtp 1 various operational parameters such as hrt and pac doses can be studied these investigations aim for better understanding the omp removal under varying operational conditions and therewith for optimization of pac dosage figs 6 8 display the influence of hrt and pac doses on diclofenac and doc removal within the pac adsorption stage of wwtp 1 diclofenac and doc were chosen for dynamic simulation for they were well predicted by the developed model as shown in batch experiments and steady state simulation results indicate that increasing the contact time has a positive effect on the diclofenac removal as can be seen from figs 6d and 7 d minimum hrt of 30 minutes resulting from maximum inflow leads to maximum diclofenac effluent concentrations of up to 1 3 µg l and minimum diclofenac removal of 50 60 in contrast maximum diclofenac removal 80 and minimum effluent concentrations 0 50 µg l appear at hrt 1 5 h besides the hrt both omp removal and omp effluent concentration are dependent on the pac dose the effluent quality can be improved by increasing the pac dose but only to a limited extend fig 8 c and d average diclofenac elimination rates of the pac adsorption stage range between 63 and 73 for dry weather and pac doses from 7 mg l to 20 mg l fig 8c for 20 mg l elimination rates exceed 70 on dry weather days and 58 on rain weather days in 85 of all cases fig 8d doubling the pac dose from 7 mg l to 15 mg l raises average elimination rate by 12 13 dry weather 63 to 72 rain weather 57 to 64 however no significant increase of adsorption performance between 15 mg l and 20 mg l pac dose is noticeable on both dry and rain weather days as pac dosage to date is mainly based on a constant concentration as 7 mg l pac in this example the wastewater inflow to the wastewater treatment plant could be considered as an additional control parameter to keep a constant omp removal pac dose could be increased with increasing flow rate or decreased with decreasing flow rate respectively regarding doc removal the influence of hrt is less pronounced whereas the effluent doc concentration is more strongly affected by pac dose compared to diclofenac see fig 6a and b to fig 8a and b average doc elimination on dry weather days varies between 17 and 33 for pac doses from 7 mg l to 20 mg l and on rain weather days between 17 and 31 increasing the pac dose from 7 mg l to 15 mg l improves doc removal efficiency by ca 61 both on dry weather and rain weather days dw 17 to 28 rw 17 to 27 part of the pac applied for omp removal is thus directly consumed by competitive doc adsorption pac doses above 15 mg l mainly support doc removal but do not further decrease the concentration of diclofenac regarding the resource efficient use of pac in this case the pac dosage should not be increased to more than 15 mg l on both dry weather and rain weather days in this case as stated in chapter 4 4 no dynamic data were available for the investigated time period to validate the dynamic model results compared to literature the model however provides in general reliable results for prediction of a full scale pac adsorption stage under dynamic conditions zietzschmann et al 2016 studied omp removal efficiency for seven wwtps and reported an increase in elimination from 40 60 to 90 for diclofenac when increasing contact time from 0 5 h to maximum equilibration time of 48 h doubling the pac dose from 7 mg pac mg doc to 15 mg pac mg doc improved diclofenac elimination by maximum 10 contrary results were found by mailler et al 2016 raising the pac dose from 10 mg l to 20 mg l increased diclofenac removal from 36 to 60 at a constant hrt of 0 5 h however doubling contact time from 0 5 h to 1 0 h only led to an increase from 32 to 39 regarding diclofenac removal this confirms that simulation results cannot be generalized but must be adapted to specific conditions such as pac product wastewater characteristics or dosage of coagulants however the use of a dynamic simulation model can help to improve the resource efficiency of pac treatment stages by considering individual pac and wastewater characteristics 6 conclusions the aim of this study was to progress a simulation tool based on mathematical models to predict the removal of anthropogenic organic micropollutants omps and dissolved organic carbon doc by powdered activated carbon adsorption in wastewater the established model is based on the tracer model trm a modification of the iast model combined with the adsorption analysis method for doc fractionation the developed model approach is able to represent multisolute adsorption behavior of omp considering competitive effects of obc without complex calculation and experimental effort model calibration using batch experiments showed promising results with a limited amount of experimental effort and therefore enables transfer to any pac type and raw wastewater with few new experiments the model can be applied to an arbitrary number of omps since all necessary batch calibration tests are conducted at once in the raw wastewater matrix the model showed satisfactory results for good adsorbable omps but seemed to poorly predict removal of micropollutants with variable or low pac affinity for example it well estimates removal of hydrochlorothiazide diclofenac benzotriazole metoprolol and 4 5 methylbenzotriazole in this study the model successfully predicted a full scale pac adsorption stage under dynamic conditions by example of diclofenac the use of a dynamic simulation model helps to improve the resource efficiency during the pac treatment stage when using a certain omp as surrogate parameter for prediction of overall omp removal it has to be chosen wisely considering variant adsorption behavior of different omps further investigations are recommended regarding the determination of doc fractionation kinetic rates and n values for different omps with varying adsorbability in order to optimize the accuracy of the presented mathematical model future studies will also verify the neglected impact of desorption along with the combination of activated sludge models to consider all integrated processes for a reliable full scale prediction declaration of competing

16063,this work presents a mathematical method to describe adsorptive removal of organic micropollutants omps and dissolved organic carbon doc from wastewater treatment plant effluent using powdered activated carbon pac the developed model is based on the tracer model trm as a modification of the ideal adsorbed solution theory iast and uses the fictive component approach for organic matter fractionation it enables the simulation of multisolute adsorption of omps considering competitive adsorption behavior of organic background compounds obc adsorption equilibrium data for doc and seven different omps as well as kinetic data for doc were derived from batch experiments performed with secondary clarifier effluent of two municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtp 1 and wwtp 2 two conventional pac products were investigated as well as one biogenic pac biopac verification and validation of the fitting results based on operational data of wwtp 1 showed promising prediction of doc and omp removal efficiency however when applied to a static simulation of a full scale pac adsorption stage the model overpredicts the removal efficiency of sulfamethoxazole and candesartan for benzotriazole carbamazepine or hydrochlorothiazide predicted removal falls below operational removal the model can be used to predict removals of good adsorbable omps but fails to accurately predict the removals of omps with variable or low pac affinity the model was further used for a dynamic simulation of doc and diclofenac effluent concentrations of a full scale pac adsorption stage with varying operating conditions and influent concentrations results show that the hydraulic retention time hrt in the contact reactor is a decisive operational parameter for omp removal efficiency

wwtps are considered to be a major point source for the emission of anthropogenic organic micropollutants omps such as pharmaceutical residues hormones personal care products detergents into the aquatic environment in recent years there is growing concern and interest in the installation of advanced treatment technologies for the removal of omps at wwtps loos et al 2013 currently ozonation and adsorption using powdered activated carbon pac or granular activated carbon gac are the technologies that are widely studied and implemented in pilot and full scale plants boehler et al 2012 hollender et al 2009 the process selection mainly depends on local conditions involving consideration of multiple factors in a cost benefit analysis margot et al 2013 to select the most suitable treatment technology it is necessary to estimate the potential omp removal as precisely as possible in order to do that predictive mathematical adsorption models are needed mathematical models are able to represent the essential aspects of the adsorptive removal processes via relationships and variables which assists a better understanding of processes and enables to predict process behavior in literature different mathematical models for adsorption of omps and dissolved organic matter onto pac in wastewater matrices are studied in order to gather information about adsorption equilibrium of different adsorbates or to qualify interactions between different adsorbates some of the most important models for multisolute adsorption are summarized in the following passages competitive adsorption can be described by the ideal adsorbed solution theory iast which allows predicting the multicomponent adsorption from single solute isotherm parameters worch 2021 the drawbacks of iast approach is that by using single solute isotherm parameters it fails to model the interactions and competition between omps and organic background concentration obc multisolute adsorption effects such as interactions between adsorbate and adsorbent different omp and obc accessibilities to adsorbent micropores or effects of pore blockage are not considered this leads to a general overestimation of competitive adsorption effects of doc worch 2021 furthermore the iast requires detailed knowledge of solution composition and high experimental effort in terms of single solute isotherm parameters of all omps and obcs in order to overcome the described problems two iast modifications were developed which are equivalent background compound model ebcm najm et al 1991 and tracer model trm burwig et al 1995 rabolt et al 1998 ebcm assumes one equivalent background compound ebc as competing adsorbate for each omp leaving all omp data concentration single solute isotherm parameter unchanged the trm modification enables the correction of single solute isotherm parameters of the omp in the presence of obc for further application in the iast however since the different constituents of the organic matter present in water or wastewater are very hard to be identified and only total isotherms can be measured experimentally using collective parameters such as doc iast precondition of known solution composition is not fulfilled one solution to the issue is to use what is known as the fictive component approach or adsorption analysis crittenden et al 1985 worch 1989 this approach allows the characterization of doc composition based on adsorbability and the transformation of the unknown mixture into a certain number of fictive components zietzschmann et al 2016 modeled the competitive adsorption between omps and background organic matter by modifying iast using the ebcm for each omp an individual ebc was set considering all observed competition effects a simplified approach of iast ebc model was also used by shimabuku et al 2017 to compare competitive adsorption in deionized and stormwater on pulverized gac trm replaces single solute omp isotherm parameters in iast with the corrected parameters in the presence of obc after determination of different fictive obc fractions using the fictive component approach the main advantage of trm compared to ebcm is its simplicity as there is no need to add new ebc fractions for each omp furthermore adsorption of obc and omp can also be modeled parallelly which is not possible in ebcm worch 2010 compared trm and ebcm approaches and reported that trm is advantageous due to these reasons however only few attempts of simulation using iast modified by trm were found in literature viegas et al 2020 predicted the adsorption of carbamazepine diclofenac and sulfamethoxazole on a carob waste derived activated powdered biochar modeling was based on a four component approach consisting of three omp and total doc without fractionation however viegas et al 2020 studied the adsorption equilibrium and isotherm of the omps without considering adsorption kinetics therefore their model could not perform dynamic simulation with varying operational parameters such as pac dose and hydraulic retention time hrt nowotny et al 2007 modeled adsorption competition between organic matter and omp onto powdered and granulated activated carbon in terms of isotherm parameter fitting using the tracer model trm the single solute freundlich parameters k and n were fitted for each omp and doc fraction leading to an overdetermined system in which several combinations of parameters might give the same goodness of fit and therefore reduce equifinality acevedo et al 2021 focused on adsorption and biodegradation of organic matter inside gac filtration and used the fictive component approach together with an iast based data fitting routine to determine adsorption dynamics of doc with gac however modeling of omp removal was not part of the study of acevedo et al 2021 to the best of the authors knowledge an iast trm model which combines both adsorption isotherms and adsorption kinetics to simulate removal of omps in wastewater matrix has not been developed yet this paper presents thus for the first time a simplified model variation of iast trm that considers not only the removal efficiency for different omps but also the significance of adsorption kinetics by pac in real wastewater it investigates the adsorption performance of pac by applying a mathematical model to steady state and dynamic simulation of a full scale pac treatment stage with use of multisolute experimental data for the correction of single solute doc and omp isotherms the model requires only a limited amount of data sets respectively experimental effort in terms of model calibration the kinetic simulation step in the model allows dynamic simulation of different operational scenarios the developed adsorption model fosters thus better understanding of omp removal by adsorption onto pac 2 model development 2 1 adsorption equilibrium the developed model is based on the tracer model trm as a modification of the ideal adsorbed solution theory iast considering competitive adsorption of omp and obc generally different single solute isotherm models can be used for the iast the model developed in this work is based on the freundlich equation eq 1 as it reaches good fitting results for activated carbon adsorption zietzschmann 2016 1 q i 0 k f i c i 0 n i with q i 0 equilibrium loading of component i g g c i

k f i freundlich constant g g g m³ n n i freundlich exponent it is assumed that doc is an appropriate sum parameter for organic background components based on the adsorption analysis crittenden et al 1985 the heterogenous character of obc is considered by four different doc fractions non 0 poorly 1 moderately 2 and well 3 adsorbable fraction each with a different value for the freundlich coefficient k f as shown in table s10 in this model approach the adsorption constants k f 1 and k f 3 for the poor and the good adsorbable doc fractions respectively are related to the medium adsorbable doc constant k f 2 as it reduces the number of unknown mathematical variables k f 1 was assumed to be half k f 2 and k f 3 twice k f 2 from the model s point of view each doc fraction except the non adsorbable doc as well as the total omp concentration is furthermore divided into the s fraction representing the concentration in the aqueous solution dissolved and unadsorbed and the x fraction representing the concentration in the solid phase adsorbed onto pac shown in table 1 the non adsorbable doc s 0 is identified as the remaining doc in the wastewater sample at equilibration time 48 h and at sufficiently high pac doses 500 mg l the adsorbable obc is then calculated as the difference between initial doc concentration and the non adsorbable fraction for simplification the adsorbable obc is distributed equally to three adsorbable fractions s 1 s 2 and s 3 good moderate and poor adsorbable eq 4 4 s 1 s 2 s 3 c 0 d o c s 0 3 for simplification of the calculation process only one omp at once is considered with the two fractions s o m p and x o m p and can be hence determined and fitted at the same time more omps can be added with increasing calculation effort 2 2 adsorption kinetics the adsorption rate is another important factor besides adsorption equilibrium for modeling adsorption processes as it determines when equilibrium will be reached mass transport within the adsorbent is dominated by film diffusion surface diffusion and pore diffusion film diffusion was not considered for modeling the adsorption of omp and obc on pac as it is negligible at high stirring velocities worch 2021 adsorption rate for surface and pore diffusion summarized as intraparticle mass transfer is described by a first order kinetic assuming that only the mean adsorbent loading is time dependent the first order kinetic rate is described according to eq 5 5 d q d t k 1 q e q q with q mean loading on the particle at time t g g k 1 first order rate constant s 1 q e q

the solid phase adsorbed g m³ at equilibrium z i molar fraction of component i v first order kinetic rate constant s 1 the kinetic rate v was determined by fitting data from doc kinetic batch experiments under the use of prior fitted equilibrium results for x i and z i assuming that adsorption competition between different omps and obc implies similar adsorption behavior adsorption kinetic rate v was derived from obc and set equal for all omps this assumption however neglects differences in intraparticle mass transport of obc and the different omps but was made to reduce the need for expensive and time consuming lab experiments the kinetic rate v determined as described above is not transferable to other conditions e g other wastewater compositions or pac products worch 2021 2 3 calculation matrix a stoichiometric matrix see table 1 based on the trm theory introduces the relationship between different components as described above it can be applied in a wwtp model to calculate the concentration of doc fractions and omp at time t by mathematical description of the different processes in the reactor these include adsorption processes for the three adsorbable doc fractions as well as one omp desorption processes of all three adsorbable doc fractions and omps and the biodegradation process of omp besides adsorption into activated carbon omps can be biologically degraded in activated sludge system clara et al 2005 biodegradation of omps was implemented in the model based on joss et al 2006 but was not considered because adsorption processes are studied within a downstream pac adsorption stage contact reactor and sedimentation tank for now desorption rates were set to zero as there are currently no data available to assess these processes with r adsorption

batch experiments for two different wastewater treatment plants wwtp 1 and wwtp 2 and different pac products were performed to determine adsorption isotherms of omps and obc as well as adsorption kinetics of obc table s1 in supplementary material provides a more detailed overview the data obtained were used for fitting of freundlich isotherm parameters k f and optionally n f as well as the process rate v in order to calibrate the developed model only wwtp 1 has a full scale pac adsorption stage thus data of this plant were used for model validation and steady state dynamic simulations of a full scale pac adsorption stage 3 1 wastewater characteristics secondary clarifier effluent from two municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtp 1 725 000 pe and wwtp 2 350 000 pe was collected in stainless steel containers on dry and rain weather days containing representative concentrations of omp and doc further samples from the pac adsorption stage effluent wwtp 1 were collected directly from the settling tank effluent no further omp or doc were added to any of the samples 3 2 pac products powdered activated carbon csc pharma clean carbon service consulting gmbh co kg vettweiss germany the same pac as used in large scale operation of wwtp 1 was used for wwtp 1 samples as well as norit sae super cabot corporation norit deutschland gmbh rheinfelden germany for comparison adsorption on norit sae super and a biopac based activated carbon was investigated with wastewater from wwtp 2 the biopac based activated carbon made of residual biomass from nature conservation green cuttings was produced at 900 c using a pyrolysis and activation lab scale reactor pyreka pyreg gmbh doerth germany with water steam activation joseph et al 2020 3 3 batch adsorption experiments two different sets of batch adsorption experiments were performed for kinetic and equilibrium studies respectively for kinetic doc studies experiments were conducted with pac doses of 10 mg l and 20 mg l using contact times of each 10 30 and 60 min to establish the adsorption isotherms for both omp and obc closed flasks with secondary effluent having pac doses in the range of 0 2 5 10 20 30 50 100 300 500 1 000 3 000 and 5 000 mg l were shaken for 48 hours pac doses up to 500 mg l were achieved by pipetting adequate volumes of pac stock suspension 10 g l into secondary effluent water the preparation of the pac stock solution is described in supplementary material for batches with higher pac doses than 500 mg l pac was added directly into secondary effluent water batch experiments were conducted in triplicate in 200 ml conical flasks at room temperature wwtp 1 gerhardt gyratory shaker c gerhardt gmbh co kg königswinter germany 135 rpm wwtp 2 overhead shaker 3040 gfl lauda gfl mbh burgwedel germany 25 rpm 3 4 obc and omp analysis samples for the analyzes were collected immediately after the respective contact times and filtered through 0 45 µm regenerated cellulose filters wwtp 1 rotilabo carl roth gmbh co kg karlsruhe germany wwtp 2 sartorius minisart sartorius corporate administration gmbh goettingen germany doc measurements were performed on a shimadzu toc l cph as described by din en 1484 2019 04 for wwtp 1 and with a dimatoc 2000 dimatec analysentechnik gmbh germany for wwtp 2 organic micropollutants were determined using hplc ms ms agilent 1260 hplc system in tandem with mass spectrometer sciex api 5000 after water sample preparation with solid phase extraction 4 model application 4 1 single solute parameter fitting with iast trm the fitting process for model calibration was done in two separate steps as described by fig 1 the first step serves the slightly altered adsorption analysis as described in section 2 1 herewith the adsorption rate and the freundlich isotherm parameter for the different doc fractions were fitted with a script written in c programming language using the corrected doc isotherm parameters and process rate as well as the experimentally obtained omp equilibrium data the freundlich isotherm parameters for omp were then fitted through a second script figure s 1 and figure s 2 in supplementary material show the developed fitting model and script dialogue for the fitting of obc and omps the developed scripts accept kinetic and isotherm data as input and offer several options for the fitting i fitting of the freundlich isotherm constant k f i and the adsorption rate v ii fitting of k f i n and v iii fitting of k f i n v and the non adsorbable fraction of doc s0 however fitting more than two parameters may result in an overdetermined system with equally fitted results najm et al 1991 while creating high calculation effort it is therefore advisable to do the fitting only for k f i and v using a fixed value for n derived from practical experience and a fixed value for s0 derived from batch experiments as described above in the present work the freundlich exponent was equalized for all doc fractions and omps at n 0 3 in both scripts a mathematical solver was used to minimize the deviation between modeled and measured concentrations different algorithms for nonlinear optimization obtained from the open source library nlopt 1 1 http github com stevengj nlopt were used and tested results obtained from cobyla optimizer were used as the cobyla optimizer showed more stability and lower standard deviation see figure s 3 4 2 simulation model of a full scale pac adsorption stage the adsorption stage vcr 3 700 m³ of wwtp 1 725 000 pe treats a maximum flow of 300 l s corresponding to a minimum hrt of 30 minutes with a current average pac dose of 7 g pac m³ a simulation model for the adsorption stage of wwtp 1 using the simulation software simba 4 3 enables comparison of model results with real effluent data the model enables both steady state and dynamic simulation of omp removal with pac two different influent blocks were developed the steady state block reads average daily values for doc and omp influent concentration as well as the total wastewater inflow the dynamic block handles influent concentration and flow rate in a resolution from 2h values up to every minute data in addition full scale description of wwtp 1 by both steady state and dynamic simulation needs to consider extra omp removal stemming from coagulation effects after adding flocculants into the pac adsorption stage the simulation run assesses 10 doc removal caused by coagulation according to mailler et al 2016 who suggest a decrease of dom concentration by maximum 15 4 3 steady state simulation of omp removal operational data of five different dry weather days for the influent and effluent of the pac adsorption stage were used to validate the steady state simulation model daily values from 24h mixed samples for both influent and effluent of the pac adsorption stage were given for doc and seven different omps including benzotriazole candesartan carbamazepine diclofenac hydrochlorothiazide irbesartan metoprolol and sulfamethoxazole daily wastewater influent was in the range between 52 600 m³ d and 72 100 m³ d the pac dose was set to a constant value of 7 mg l according to real operating conditions for isotherm and kinetic data fitting prior to simulation the results from batch experiments with csc pharma clean were used in accordance with the pac product at the treatment plant freundlich k value and adsorption process rate were determined as defined in chapter 0 and inserted into the model the model was then used to predict doc and omp concentrations in the pac adsorption stage effluent and compared to real elimination performance of the pac adsorption stage 4 4 dynamic simulation of omp removal to further test the developed model as a tool for planning and process optimization a dynamic simulation was performed with operating data from wwtp 1 for a dry weather day qdw 81 000 m³ d and a rain weather day qrw 160 000 m³ d in contrast to the steady state simulation approach which is based on daily average operational data and therefore provides only information on daily average omp removal by pac adsorption the dynamic simulation considers the varying influent pattern of a wastewater treatment plant as the pac dose needed for a constant omp removal is also depending on influent concentration and the hydraulic retention time hrt in the contact reactor knowledge of the actual influent concentration and flow rate for both dry weather and rain weather days can help to optimize the use of operational resources by improving the pac dosage concept influent data of the pac adsorption stage were given in 2h intervals for doc and diclofenac concentrations and used for simulation of continuous effluent concentration of the pac adsorption stage as there are no real effluent data available for the investigated time period a dynamic validation of the model was not possible the model therefore only provides comparative results for different fictive operational states diclofenac concentrations in the influent of the pac adsorption stage ranged from 2 0 µg l to 3 5 µg l on the dry weather day and from 1 6 µg l to 2 8 µg l on the rain weather day doc was in the range of 5 6 mg l to 6 5 mg l at dry weather and 3 8 mg l to 5 9 mg l at rain weather respectively influent flow rate of the pac adsorption stage was limited to 300 l s maximum for simulation according to real operation conditions different pac doses 7 10 15 20 mg l were tested as well as the influence of the hydraulic retention time in the contact reactor as a function of the wastewater flow rate 5 results and discussion 5 1 fitting of single solute freundlich isotherm parameters in batch adsorption experiments three different pacs and seven different omps were investigated for two separate wwtp effluents both secondary clarifier effluents from wwtp 1 and wwtp 2 were treated with norit sae further experiments were carried out by either adding csc pharma clean to the effluent of wwtp 1 or biopac to the effluent of wwtp 2 table 2 the corrected freundlich isotherm parameters k f i of each doc fraction and omp obtained with the fitting process as described in chapter 0 are summarized in table 2 fig 2 shows the fitting results of doc isotherm and kinetic data the model predicts the doc equilibrium well r2 0 88 with r2 coefficient of determination calculated as one minus the ratio between residual sum of squares and total sum of squares however regarding adsorption kinetics fig 2b the model generally underestimates the remaining doc concentration at the beginning of the adsorption process but overestimates it by the end of the equilibration time 48 h except for the biopac in other words calculated pac loading of doc is higher during the first hours of adsorption process but lower after equilibration time of 48 h as compared to the measured data the variation between the measured and the simulated obc kinetic data may result from the fact that the adsorbable obcis evenly distributed to three adsorbable fractions s 1 s 2 and s 3 good moderate and poor adsorbable in this study which may not represent the reality fig 3 depicts the fitting results of four selected omps benzotriazole hydrochlorothiazide sulfamethoxazole and diclofenac measurement data for all analyzed omps are listed in table s 4 to table s 8and the fitting results for other omps are shown in figure s 4 in supplementary material values of the coefficient of determination r2 differ strongly depending on omp and pac characteristics the measured and simulated omp equilibrium concentrations at different pac doses correlate well for hydrochlorothiazide diclofenac benzotriazole metoprolol and 4 5 methylbenzotriazole fig 3 and figure s 4 for the removal of benzotriazole 0 90 r2 0 98 the mathematical model overestimates the removal especially for small pac doses up to 10 mg l see fig 3 a however the model underestimates carbamazepine removals 0 86 r2 0 94 for the same low pac doses see figure s 4 a for the removal of hydrochlorothiazide 0 45 r2 0 99 and diclofenac 0 77 r2 0 96 the mathematical model underestimates the removal especially with wwtp 1 and pac doses 10 mg l see fig 3 b and d the model well predicted removal of metoprolol and 4 5 methylbenzotriazole for wwtp1 at different pac dosages as can be seen in fig s 4 e as for sulfamethoxazole fig 3 c and candesartan figure s 4 c the model fails to predict the equilibrium concentrations where r2 strongly differs among the investigated pac products and water sample sulfamethoxazole was defined as a weak adsorbate or substance with variable low pac affinity in literature margot et al 2013 zietzschmann et al 2015 altmann et al 2015 also reported that sulfamethoxazole removal showed larger variation compared to carbamazepine and diclofenac under the same conditions the same applies for candesartan which is considered as a substance with variable or low pac affinity probably due to its negative charge and low dow decrey et al 2020 reasons behind the poor model results for poor adsorbable omps might be the simplified obc fractionation where equal fractions of organic matter with different adsorbability were assumed micropollutants with variable or low pac affinity are expected to be more affected by obc competition on adsorption sites another reason might be assuming equal adsorption kinetic rates for obc and the different omps thus neglecting the differences in intraparticle mass transfer except for benzotriazole a lower level of correlation between model and experimental data is observed for biopac in comparison to conventional pacs factors such as surface area polarity porosity and functional groups of various pacs shall be considered when evaluating the adsorption performances of conventional pacs and biopacs nielsen et al 2014 adsorption behavior of omp on biopac might be influenced by the relatively high mineral content of nature conservation biomass in conjunction with lower carbon content compared to conventional pac hensgen et al 2012 while minerals may provide favourable adsorption sites for omp specific surface area might be limited by lower carbon content similar results are drawn from fig 4 which illustrates the mean of relative difference between simulated and measured equilibrium concentrations at different pac doses estimated as mean of c i s i m c i l a b c 0 l a b at different pac doses negative values imply an overprediction of adsorption by the model i e calculating lower soluble concentration and thus higher pac loadings as compared to the results from batch experiments positive values show that the model underestimates the pac adsorption for the related omp simulation results for benzotriazole show better adsorption behavior than by experimental data for both wwtp 1 and wwtp 2 and all pac products for diclofenac the model shows an underprediction of omp removal for wwtp 1 while overpredicting the elimination rate for wwtp 2 regarding hydrochlorothiazide an underprediction can be observed for all wastewaters and pacs except for the biopac investigated with wastewater from wwtp 2 5 2 prediction of full scale omp and doc adsorption onto powdered activated carbon by steady state simulation with purpose of model validation a steady state simulation of omp removal by pac was carried out by applying the developed model approach to full scale pac adsorption stage of wwtp 1 see figure s5 in supplementary material fig 5 shows comparison between measured removal efficiency of seven omps and doc derived from measured data of wwtp 1 and simulated values on five different dry weather days both measured and simulated values refer to the omp removal of the pac adsorption stage considering the influent of pac contact reactor and effluent of pac sedimentation tank for benzotriazole irbesartan diclofenac hydrochlorothiazide and carbamazepine predicted removal falls below the measured removal within the pac adsorption stage of wwtp 1 this observation corroborates the modeling results for diclofenac and hydrochlorothiazide in batch experiments see fig 4 wwtp 1 csc contrary to batch experiments the steady state simulation underpredicts the benzotriazole removal compared to measured mean value at pac doses 10 mg l the distinctive model performance especially for benzotriazole is not yet conclusively answered the removal of sulfamethoxazole and candesartan fluctuated during the 5 separate sampling days here the model slightly overpredicts the removal efficiency referred to the mean removal derived from the measured data similar to batch experiments an unpredictable adsorption performance of omps such as sulfamethoxazole and candesartan results in poorly consistent model behavior within the pac adsorption stage of wwtp 1 5 3 prediction of full scale omp and doc adsorption onto powdered activated carbon by dynamic simulation by applying the developed model approach to a dynamic simulation of the full scale pac adsorption stage of wwtp 1 various operational parameters such as hrt and pac doses can be studied these investigations aim for better understanding the omp removal under varying operational conditions and therewith for optimization of pac dosage figs 6 8 display the influence of hrt and pac doses on diclofenac and doc removal within the pac adsorption stage of wwtp 1 diclofenac and doc were chosen for dynamic simulation for they were well predicted by the developed model as shown in batch experiments and steady state simulation results indicate that increasing the contact time has a positive effect on the diclofenac removal as can be seen from figs 6d and 7 d minimum hrt of 30 minutes resulting from maximum inflow leads to maximum diclofenac effluent concentrations of up to 1 3 µg l and minimum diclofenac removal of 50 60 in contrast maximum diclofenac removal 80 and minimum effluent concentrations 0 50 µg l appear at hrt 1 5 h besides the hrt both omp removal and omp effluent concentration are dependent on the pac dose the effluent quality can be improved by increasing the pac dose but only to a limited extend fig 8 c and d average diclofenac elimination rates of the pac adsorption stage range between 63 and 73 for dry weather and pac doses from 7 mg l to 20 mg l fig 8c for 20 mg l elimination rates exceed 70 on dry weather days and 58 on rain weather days in 85 of all cases fig 8d doubling the pac dose from 7 mg l to 15 mg l raises average elimination rate by 12 13 dry weather 63 to 72 rain weather 57 to 64 however no significant increase of adsorption performance between 15 mg l and 20 mg l pac dose is noticeable on both dry and rain weather days as pac dosage to date is mainly based on a constant concentration as 7 mg l pac in this example the wastewater inflow to the wastewater treatment plant could be considered as an additional control parameter to keep a constant omp removal pac dose could be increased with increasing flow rate or decreased with decreasing flow rate respectively regarding doc removal the influence of hrt is less pronounced whereas the effluent doc concentration is more strongly affected by pac dose compared to diclofenac see fig 6a and b to fig 8a and b average doc elimination on dry weather days varies between 17 and 33 for pac doses from 7 mg l to 20 mg l and on rain weather days between 17 and 31 increasing the pac dose from 7 mg l to 15 mg l improves doc removal efficiency by ca 61 both on dry weather and rain weather days dw 17 to 28 rw 17 to 27 part of the pac applied for omp removal is thus directly consumed by competitive doc adsorption pac doses above 15 mg l mainly support doc removal but do not further decrease the concentration of diclofenac regarding the resource efficient use of pac in this case the pac dosage should not be increased to more than 15 mg l on both dry weather and rain weather days in this case as stated in chapter 4 4 no dynamic data were available for the investigated time period to validate the dynamic model results compared to literature the model however provides in general reliable results for prediction of a full scale pac adsorption stage under dynamic conditions zietzschmann et al 2016 studied omp removal efficiency for seven wwtps and reported an increase in elimination from 40 60 to 90 for diclofenac when increasing contact time from 0 5 h to maximum equilibration time of 48 h doubling the pac dose from 7 mg pac mg doc to 15 mg pac mg doc improved diclofenac elimination by maximum 10 contrary results were found by mailler et al 2016 raising the pac dose from 10 mg l to 20 mg l increased diclofenac removal from 36 to 60 at a constant hrt of 0 5 h however doubling contact time from 0 5 h to 1 0 h only led to an increase from 32 to 39 regarding diclofenac removal this confirms that simulation results cannot be generalized but must be adapted to specific conditions such as pac product wastewater characteristics or dosage of coagulants however the use of a dynamic simulation model can help to improve the resource efficiency of pac treatment stages by considering individual pac and wastewater characteristics 6 conclusions the aim of this study was to progress a simulation tool based on mathematical models to predict the removal of anthropogenic organic micropollutants omps and dissolved organic carbon doc by powdered activated carbon adsorption in wastewater the established model is based on the tracer model trm a modification of the iast model combined with the adsorption analysis method for doc fractionation the developed model approach is able to represent multisolute adsorption behavior of omp considering competitive effects of obc without complex calculation and experimental effort model calibration using batch experiments showed promising results with a limited amount of experimental effort and therefore enables transfer to any pac type and raw wastewater with few new experiments the model can be applied to an arbitrary number of omps since all necessary batch calibration tests are conducted at once in the raw wastewater matrix the model showed satisfactory results for good adsorbable omps but seemed to poorly predict removal of micropollutants with variable or low pac affinity for example it well estimates removal of hydrochlorothiazide diclofenac benzotriazole metoprolol and 4 5 methylbenzotriazole in this study the model successfully predicted a full scale pac adsorption stage under dynamic conditions by example of diclofenac the use of a dynamic simulation model helps to improve the resource efficiency during the pac treatment stage when using a certain omp as surrogate parameter for prediction of overall omp removal it has to be chosen wisely considering variant adsorption behavior of different omps further investigations are recommended regarding the determination of doc fractionation kinetic rates and n values for different omps with varying adsorbability in order to optimize the accuracy of the presented mathematical model future studies will also verify the neglected impact of desorption along with the combination of activated sludge models to consider all integrated processes for a reliable full scale prediction declaration of competing

16064,biofilm carriers can avoid microorganism washout while maintaining a high amount of biomass but are also associated with a long biofilm formation period and biofilm aging a single stage partial nitritation anammox process single stage pn a reactor was setup to study the biofilm growth characterization and treatment performance under an nlr of 0 53 to 0 90 gn l d over one year biofilm growth was divided into three stages the formation stage maturation stage and aging stage the initial biofilm was observed at day 84 a nitrogen removal efficiency of 83 4 was achieved at an nlr of 0 90 gn l d during the mature biofilm stage starvation nitrogen gas accumulation and hydroxyapatite formation resulted in biofilm aging after mechanical stirring treatment biofilm reactivation was achieved by biofilm re formation within one month there is clear potential for phosphorus recovery as indicated by the 5 24 6 29 phosphorus content in the biofilm similar to the 5 7 phosphorus content in enhanced biological phosphate removal sludge the anaob genera abundance in the biofilm maintained at a high level of 18 25 32 31 while the abundance of anaob increased from the initial 4 10 to 13 78 after mechanical stirring treatment in the suspended sludge ensured biofilm reactivation the results of this study clearly show that mechanical stirring treatment can be used to achieve the biofilm reactivation as the biofilm fills with the hollow cylindrical carrier this study has potential as a useful reference for the realization of the wide application of the biofilm single stage pn a process in the future graphical abstract image graphical abstract keyword single stage partial nitritation anammox carrier hydroxyapatite 1 introduction the anammox process is a promising alternative biological nitrogen removal process it compares well to the traditional nitrification denitrification process and is more economical guo et al 2019 since it is based on the anammox process the single stage partial nitritation anammox process single stage pn a has a space advantage over the double stage pn a process furukawa et al 2006 however there are still bottlenecks in the application of the single stage pn a process the long doubling time 11d of anammox bacteria anaob the synergistic coexistence between ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and anaob and functional bacteria washout with effluent qian et al 2021 flocs granules and biofilm are the biomass types developed for the single stage pn a process in the case of the flocs system the low settling rate of the flocs sludge makes it extremely sensitive to such environmental fluctuations as high organic matter and short hydraulic retention time hrt fluctuations in these factors are known to result in serious sludge washout with poor nitrogen removal performance guo et al 2020a zhang et al 2020 the dense structure of granular sludge has excellent biomass retention ability with superior nitrogen removal performance and facilitates the proliferation of anaob guo and li 2020 however due to the low sludge yield of anaob the formation period of granules is excessively lengthy kartal et al 2012 to maximize the amount of functional bacteria the addition of carriers is common in single stage pn a processes in the treatment of real wastewater yang et al 2021 the high specific surface area of carriers provides an attachment for anaob and aob which avoids sludge washout and maintain high biomass adams et al 2020 for the biofilm single stage pn a process such as moving bed biofilm reactor it is widely reported that anaob is dominant in the biofilm while aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob are dominant in the suspended sludge chen et al 2021 wells et al 2017 azari et al also reported that higher abundance of anaob in suspended sludge than in biofilms in an integrated fixed film activated sludge sequencing batch reactor azari et al 2020 it is possible to choose to achieve the nob suppression by suspended sludge discharge li et al 2019 in a recent study it was demonstrated that the increase of anaob activity and abundance in the biofilm is associated with a reduction in the concentration of the suspended sludge li et al 2021 this indicates that the microbial structure and nitrogen removal pathway of the carrier single stage pn a system can be effectively regulated by the discharge of suspended sludge adding k1 and k3 carriers made of polyethylene can reduce sludge loss to lower levels than those associated with the granular single stage pn a system azari et al 2021 biofilms have been shown to improve the stability tolerance of anaob in mainstream treatment li et al 2021 however in most of the previous studies the focus has been on the effect of different carrier types on the microbial community and the enrichment of anaob in the single stage pn a process such as polyvinylidene chloride biochar polyethylene sponge adams et al 2020 yang et al 2021 only a few studies have been focused on the characteristics of biofilm formation on the carrier surface with a low nitrogen loading rate nlr and limited operation period almstrand et al 2014 yang et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 a distinctive feature of biofilm formation is the thickening of the film itself as the biomass increases however it has been reported that excessive biofilm thickness hinders the anaob from obtaining the substrate and causes the death of the anaob in the inner biofilm ahmad et al 2017 gu et al 2020 in another study stripping of part of the biofilm so that it becomes part of the suspended sludge by the shear force of the liquor and air to form granular sludge was shown to contribute to maintaining the stable operation of the single stage pn a process zhang et al 2015 despite the contribution of these studies to understanding biofilm formation and the risk of biomass loss to carrier biofilms the biofilm mechanism and stable operation strategy are still unclear hollow cylindrical carriers are widely used in the single stage pn a process to enrichment anaob chen et al 2021 chen et al 2018 tatara et al 2017 in the case of granular sludge it has been shown that n2 produced by the anammox reaction accumulates inside the granular sludge causing gas pockets and granular floatation campos et al 2017 wang et al 2021a because the structure of the biofilm inside the hollow cylindrical carriers is similar to granular sludge it is possible that the risk of n2 accumulation and floatation is also similar however this has been the focus of little research in this field it has been reported that the permeability of anaob granules almost disappeared when the granule size exceeded 1 5 mm xu et al 2021 therefore the effect of the size of the hollow cylindrical carriers on the biofilm mass transfer needs to be determined it is also necessary to systematically investigate the requirements for maintaining high activity on hollow cylinder carrier biofilms in this study a hollow cylinder biofilm carrier was used to study and optimize the operational conditions in the single stage pn a process for high strength ammonium wastewater treatment the novelty of this work is twofold 1 it is intended to reveal the characterization of biofilm growth and reasons of its aging and 2 to investigate a simple mechanical stirring treatment strategy for treating hollow cylindrical carriers with aging biofilms and the results are to be used to validate this anammox biofilm reactivation method 2 materials and methods 2 1 biofilm carriers the hollow cylindrical carriers used in this study were made of polypropylene and had a height of 10mm and a diameter of 10mm type of rk 04z098 sumitomo bakelite co ltd japan the specific density and specific surface area were 0 98 g cm3 and 800 m2 m3 respectively 2 2 experiment set up a gas lift reactor glr made of polyethylene with an effective volume of 5 l and a sedimentation volume of 1 l was used in this study fig 1 at day 1 virgin biofilm carriers were added into the reactor with a packing ratio of 25 the operation temperature of the glr reactor was kept at 25 c with a heater an aeration pump was used to provide oxygen to the aob while maintaining the ideal circulation of carriers inside the reactor 2 3 reactor operation the whole operation was divided into 8 phases according to the different nlrs table 1 from phase ⅰ to phase ⅲ the nlr was increased from 0 75 gn l d to 0 9 gn l d and then to 1 20 gn l d to study the rector operation performance under different nlrs ammonium concentrations in high strength ammonium wastewaters such as sludge dewatering liquids typically exceed 500 mg l wang et al 2020b to investigate the performance of the single stage pn a process for treating high ammonium wastewater

the activity reactivation stage 2 4 synthetic wastewater and inoculum sludge the synthetic wastewater used as the influent was composed of nh4hco3 and the same amount of nahco3 nahco3 was added to supplement the reaction substrate of aob and anaob as well as to supplement the alkalinity the composition of the synthetic wastewater was composed l 1 of 0 081 g kh2po4 0 214 g na2hpo4 12h2o 0 036 g

bacteria sda all the measurements were conducted in parallel using the same procedures described in an earlier study chen et al 2018 the reactor potential of the functional bacteria based on the activity tests and mlvss was calculated by eq 1 1 reactor potential gn l d saa gn gmlvss d mlvss g l 2 6 microbial community analysis the sludge samples biofilm and suspended were collected at day 1 and at the end of phase ⅰ phase ⅱ phase ⅴ phase ⅵ and phase ⅷ and to study the microbial community by high throughput sequencing the pcr amplification of the prokaryotic 16s rrna gene was performed with 341f 5 cctacgggnggcwgcag 3 and 805r 5 gactachvgggtatctaatcc 3 dna sequencing was performed using the miseq reagent kit v2 illumina usa of the miseq system at bioengineering lab co ltd kanagawa japan 2 7 chemical analysis and analysis of sludge characterization influent and effluent samples were collected every other day and filtered through a 0 45 μm syringe filter ammonia nitrite and nitrate concentrations were measured by capillary electrophoresis agilent 7100 usa the mlss and mlvss were measured by the standard method apha 2005 a volume of 1 l mixed liquor was poured into a 1 l glass graduated cylinder and the level of the mud liquid interface was recorded after 30 minutes to measure the sv30 sludge volume after 30 min of sedimentation after the sv30 test the mlss and mlvss of the mixed liquor were measured to calculate the sludge volume index svi and the remaining mixed liquor was returned to the reactor extracellular polymeric substances eps were measured by the method outlined in an earlier study xue et al 2020 polysaccharide content was measured using the phenol sulfuric acid method and protein was determined by the lowry method respectively scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive x ray sem edx was used to observe the characterization of biofilm sludge the organic components of the sludge c h o n s were measured by an elemental analyzer elementar germany after the sludge was dried at 105 c overnight raman spectrum and x ray diffraction xrd were used to determine the crystal species in the biofilm sludge then the sludge samples were digested in a microwave digester milestone italy and detected by icp oes agilent 720 usa for the inorganic component ca and p 3 results and discussion 3 1 overall performance of single stage pn a process the operation performance of the reactor is shown in fig 2 in phase ⅰ the mean nitrogen removal efficiency nre increased from 24 96 to 58 20 the ammonium surplus 40mg l 180mg l was the major obstacle to achieving a higher nre throughout phase ⅰ the ammonium surplus led to free ammonia fa concentrations of 16 7 mg l 27 4 mg l which exceeded the 10 inhibition threshold of anaob 15 mg l zhang et al 2016 the nitrite concentration remained below 20mg l at most times and free nitrous acid fna was below 2mg l which was far less than the 10 inhibition threshold of 10μg l for anaob in the case of ammonium surplus and nitrite below 15 mg l ar was increased to promote more nitrite production however the effluent nitrite quickly increased exceeding 50 mg l which indicated the lower activity of anaob limited its ability to utilize more nitrite the adjustment of the ar has been shown to be challenging in the startup of single stage pn a process due to the loss of anaob biomass and its low activity zhang et al 2020 also the local over aeration inside the reactor caused by the non ideal circulation of carriers resulted in nitrite over oxidation under the high nob activity the mean δno3 n δnr in phase ⅰ was 0 14 which was higher than the ideal operation value of 0 11 for the single stage pn a process in phase ⅱ the nlr was adjusted to 0 90 gn l d to stimulate anaob activity a higher nre of 73 6 was achieved after two days of operation indicating that the nitrogen removal performance of the single stage pn a system was significantly enhanced in the short term at a higher nlr a mean nre of 83 30 was obtained in phase ⅱ in phase ⅲ the nlr further increased to 1 20 gn l d however the nre rapidly decreased to 36 75 within 4 days the effluent nitrite increased to 161mg l suggesting that nitrogen overloading resulted in the poor nre the nlr rebounded to 0 90 gn l d in phase ⅳ and the nre recovered to 83 30 within 7 days in phase ⅴ the nlr was kept at 0 90 gn l d and the effect of influent ammonium concentration on the single stage pn a process was evaluated by adjusting the ammonium from 600 mg l to 1000 mg l the average effluent nitrite and nre were 464 17 mg l and 26 90 respectively the ar at the first hrt in phase ⅴ was maintained as it was in phase ⅳ which resulted in the over oxidation of ammonium caused by aob carvajal arroyo et al reported that the 50 inhibitory concentration of nitrite for anaob activity was 384 mg l carvajal arroyo et al 2014 in this study the accumulation of nitrite 464 17 mg l caused severe inhibition of anaob and resulted in ammonium surplus 260 mg l finally the dual inhibition of anaob by fna and fa resulted in the rapid deterioration of the nre in phase ⅵ influent ammonium was reduced to 600mg l the nlr was 0 90 gn l d but the nre was a low 45 the single stage pn a process was only able to achieve stable operation at the influent ammonium of 350mg l with an nlr of 0 53 gn l d this indicates that as much as half the nitrogen removal ability of the single stage pn a process was lost after 300 days of operation the biofilm reactivation biofilm re formation was achieved in two steps in the first step the carriers were treated to mechanical stirring at the nlr of 0 53 gn l d in phase ⅶ the video showing the mechanical stirring treatment is provided in the supplementary material then the carriers and the shed biofilm were all returned to the reactor in the second step the growth of biofilm was promoted by gradually increasing the ammonium concentration in the influent 26 days later the biofilm reactivation was achieved the nlr had returned to 0 90 gn l d in phase ⅷ due to the increase in influent ammonium concentrations to 600mg l within 6 days with a mean nre of 84 8 3 2 morphology characteristics of biofilm the morphological features of the biofilm were examined by camera and sem edx as shown in figs 3 and 4 the holes and bulges on the surface of the carriers are beneficial to the formation of the biofilm since they trap microorganisms almstrand et al 2014 gu et al 2020 at day 84 the read biofilm can be observed on the surface of carriers fig 3b the red color is a striking feature of the anaob and is due to the presence of heme c kang et al 2020 ma et al 2019 this period was regarded as the biofilm formation stage at day 156 the biofilm shows signs of growing from the carrier surface to the center of the carrier fig 3c most noteworthy the outer biofilm had become recessed toward the inner biofilm this unique structure may be caused by the shear force generated by the liquid and air scouring at day 214 the carriers were completely filled with biofilm and the biofilm turned bright red this period was termed the mature biofilm stage the gas pockets found in the core of the biofilm are likely to have resulted from caused by n2 accumulation due to the anammox reaction guo et al 2021 wang et al 2021a at day 310 the biofilm aging stage had begun the biofilm was clearly divided into two colors the outer biofilm was bright read and the inner biofilm was light red it has been reported that the color of the anaob directly reflects the nature of the anaob activity kang et al 2018 the light of the red inner biofilm indicates that the anaob activity is lower than the bright red outer biofilm anaob granules larger than 2mm in diameter are known to be more vulnerable to starvation than smaller granules kindaichi et al 2007 the biofilm inside the carrier was classified as an anaob granule sludge and the 10 mm diameter of biofilm granule was considered to be at risk of starvation pores have been reported for different anaob biomass types in the granules and the biofilms and can benefits substrate dispersion and gas release li et al 2016 wang et al 2021b in this study the pores may have been blocked by the eps due to the excessive biofilm thickness during the biofilm mature stage and may have formed gas pockets at this stage campos et al 2017 the long term accumulation of n2 may have resulted in an increase in the volume of the gas pockets the low anaob activity of the inner biofilm and gas pockets may be factors in the poor nre in phase ⅶ mechanical rupture is an effective strategy to reactivate the floating anaob granular sludge chen et al 2010 at day 312 fig 3f mechanical stirring was used to facilitate the peeling of the aging biofilm and a new biofilm was formed based on the biofilm remaining on the carriers within 30days which was much faster than that in the virgin carrier this period was defined as the biofilm reactivation stage the sem results showed that single cell aggregation colony coalescence and filamentous bacteria coexist in the biofilm at the biofilm formation stage fig 4b filamentous bacteria plays the role of connecting single cell aggregation and colony coalescence in the biofilm mature stage there was an irregular covering of dense granular sludge on the carrier surface in comparison the morphology of the granular sludge had almost disappeared in the biofilm aging stage it was found by sem edx that the elemental concentrations of oxygen calcium and phosphorus had increased significantly from the biofilm mature stage to the biofilm aging stage fig 4e and f this dramatic increase in elemental concentration may be another important factor contributing to the biofilm aging it was reported that the formation of basalt biofilms can be divided into three steps from the growth of single cells to micro colonies to the growth of micro colonies to small biofilms to the growth of biofilms heijnen et al 1992 fig 4b fig s1 and fig 5 c correspond to the above three stages respectively it has been shown that the growth of biofilms on fleece tiles made of synthetic polymeric fibers also can be divided into three distinct stages colonization succession and maturation niederdorfer et al 2021 heterotrophic bacteria form microcolonies in the initial colonization stage and anaob slowly grow into the biofilm in the subsequent succession stage in this study filamentous bacteria played an important role in linking single cells and colonies during biofilm formation stage as reported in another study fig 4b xiao et al 2021 then anaob became the dominant microorganism during biofilm maturation fig 4c as was reported in a recent study niederdorfer et al 2021 however there are few reports on biofilm aging and biofilm reactivation under mainstream conditions the initial biofilm was observed on the surface of the carrier after 230 days of operation wu et al 2021 in another mainstream study it took more than 24 months to form the matured biofilms niederdorfer et al 2021 the slow growth of microorganisms under the mainstream conditions may make it difficult to complete the entire process of biofilm formation mature and aging in one study 3 3 the sludge characteristics the initial mlss of suspended sludge was 6 90 g l fig 5 at day 96 mlss increased to 15 58 g l and the sludge volume index svi was 23 11 ml g the low svi indicates excellent sludge settleability which contributes to a high nrr an nrr of 2 02 gn l d was reported at an svi below 80 ml g in a single stage pn a reactor wang et al 2017b guo et al also reported that an nrr of 1 20 gn l d was successfully kept at an svi below 15 ml g guo and li 2020 to date the highest nrr of 3 90 gn l d for single stage pn a process was achieved in an internal loop air lift reactor with a svi of 78 42 ml g wang et al 2017a a high mlvss was associated with a low svi in these studies 9 0 g l in one study wang et al 2017a and 11 01 g l in another guo and li 2020 in this study the mlvss of suspended sludge was only 3 10 g l at day 96 and the mlvss mlss ratio was at a low 0 20 the high inorganic matter concentration was responsible for the low sludge activity and was not conducive to the initial formation of biofilm on the surface of the carriers from day 97 to day 133 the suspended sludge was discharged to increase the mlvss mlss ratio to 0 53 and reduce the mlss to 2 32 g l after that the mean mlvss of the suspended sludge was 1 67 g l while the average mlvss mlss ratio was 0 68 it should be noted that the svi was in the range of 141 18 ml g to 347 59 ml g the high svi limited the contribution of suspended sludge to the nitrogen removal capacity of the single stage pn a system in the case of the biofilm 0 64 g l mlvss was detected at day 48 thereafter the mlvss increased to 4 40 g l at day 96 which was even higher than that in the suspended sludge at the initial stage of phase ⅶ the mlvss was as high as 5 75g l with an mlvss mlss ratio of 0 50 anaob was more inclined to grow in the biofilm due to the oxygen concentration gradient adams et al 2020 the high mlvss indicates that anaob had a high nitrogen removal ability however the single stage pn a process can only achieve stable operation under an nlr of 0 53 gn l d the poor nlr indicates the properties and structure of biofilm had changed at day 312 in phase ⅶ mechanical stirring treatment resulted in a sharp decrease in the mlvss to 0 22 g l the mlvss recovered to 4 44 g l within 30 days and the nlr readjusted to 0 90 gn l d 3 4 elementary composition of sludge the elementary composition of sludge is shown in table 2 the elemental biomass composition of total biofilm in the biofilm mature stage was ch2o0 67n0 15s0 01ca0 14p0 08 and it was ch2 02o0 86n0 13s0 008ca0 17p0 09 in the biofilm aging stage the carbon content decreased from 30 06 during the mature biofilm stage to 21 66 during the biofilm aging stage suggesting the loss of biomass in the total biofilm the carbon content in inner biofilm was only 22 71 and was 29 41 in outer biofilm this indicates that the biomass was predominantly in the outer biofilm the results of the xrd analysis fig s2 were compared with reference spectra in the database this revealed that hydroxyapatite ca5 po4 3oh hap calcium hydrogen phosphate hydrate ca h2po4 2h2o and calcium phosphate ca3 po4 2 were the major phases in the inner biofilm a raman spectra analysis fig s2 was further used to determine the main crystal only the sludge band of 957 cm 1 was very close to the band of hap at po4 3 1 961cm 1 rey et al 2011 hence the major substance in the inner biofilm was determined to be hap the calcium and phosphorus content were 17 15 and 7 15 in the inner biofilm and 9 20 and 4 30 in the outer biofilm respectively the ca p of outer biofilm was 2 14 which was close to the theoretical ratio of hap 2 15 whereas the ca p in the inner biofilm was much higher at 2 40 the higher ratio was caused by the formation of hap and the starvation caused by the excessive biofilm thickness chen et al 2010 the ca p in the two stages of suspended sludge ranged between 1 45 1 64 and in the total biofilm it was 2 32 2 33 indicating that the hap was mostly distributed in the biofilm hap precipitation is induced by ph and substrate concentration guo and li 2020 magrí et al 2021 the alkaline environment created by the anammox reaction and the organic matter released by microorganisms are both conducive to phosphate biomineralization arias et al 2017 the high abundance of anaob in the biofilm is conducive to the formation of hap aggregation however the nitritation reaction dominated by the aob in the suspended sludge is an acid production process which is not conducive to the accumulation of hap the results of this study show that the suspended sludge was more susceptible to the impact of the external environment than the biofilm nitrogen overload and substrate inhibition are known to result in sludge disintegration and make it difficult for hap to efficiently couple with sludge the phosphorus content in pure anaob process was only 1 4 lotti et al 2014 in this study the phosphorus content in the biofilm was in the range of 5 24 6 29 this phosphorus content is higher than in the pure anaob process and equivalent to the phosphorus content in enhanced biological phosphate removal sludge which is typically between 5 and 7 yuan et al 2012 after mechanical stirring treatment most of the stripped biofilm can be utilized for phosphorus recovery and the other part of the biofilm can be returned to the single stage pn a reactor to maintain the stable operation of the single stage pn a process this study provided a new way to remove phosphorus from wastewater using a biofilm single stage pn a process 3 5 specific activity tests and reactor potential the saoa values of the suspended sludge were all above 2 30 gn gvss d and the lowest reactor potential of 2 0 gn l d was higher than the highest nlr of 1 20 gn l d fig 6 as shown in table 3 the saoa was significantly higher than the samxa reported in other biofilm single stage pn a systems chen et al 2018 guo et al 2020b this suggests that as functional bacteria aob is not the major limiting factor in the biofilm single stage pn a process due to the oxygen concentration gradient the same phenomena can be found in suspended single stage pn a process chen et al 2020 chini et al 2016 however a significantly higher samxa than saoa and a relative equilibrium between samxa and saoa were also observed akaboci et al 2018 wu et al 2016 therefore the suspended single stage pn a process has a higher risk of unstable operation caused by sludge washout the samxa of the biofilm decreased from 0 29 gn gvss d at day 84 to 0 11 gn gvss d at day 138 this was likely due to the loss in the biofilm biomass caused by the impinging of the carriers after the discharge of the suspended sludge in another study a short hrt of 2 h also resulted in biomass loss in biofilm chen et al 2021 the reduction in samxa from 0 21 gn gvss d in phase ⅳ to 0 12 gn gvss d found in phase ⅶ was caused by biofilm aging the samxa in the different types of sludge and reactors were all below 0 4 gn gvss d under 25 c table 3 a poor nre has been shown to be accompanied by a lower saa akaboci et al 2018 chini et al 2016 in this study the samxa of suspended sludge were all below 0 15 gn gvss d hence the constant and high samxa activity of the biofilm plays a crucial role in the stable operation of the single stage pn a system after mechanical stirring the samxa of the biofilm recovered to 0 28 gn gvss d in phase ⅷ the highest snoa of 0 35 gn gvss d at day 84 was attributed to the local over aeration inside the reactor after sludge discharge and under high nlr inhibition the snoa was kept below 0 20 gn gvss d unstable operation can result in the anaob releasing more eps which can be used by heterotrophic bacteria kindaichi et al 2012 wang et al 2020a with the increase in nre from 24 96 to 84 80 the sda significantly decreased from 0 20 gn gvss d in phase ⅰ to 0 05 gn gvss d in phase ⅷ 3 6 the sludge characteristics in the biofilm aging and reactivation stages 3 6 1 biofilm aging stage the biomass distribution in the biofilm aging stage was not homogeneous the mlvss in the suspended sludge was 0 88 g l and 1 82 g l in the total biofilm fig 7 b however the mlss increased significantly from 1 30 g l to 6 90 g l the mlvss mlss ratio showed a downward trend from 0 72 to 0 18 in the suspended sludge total biofilm outer biofilm and inner biofilm the samxa of the total biofilm was 0 15 gn gvss d and 0 08 gn gvss d in the suspended sludge fig 7c the results showed that the anaob activity in the biofilm was still superior to that in suspended sludge even during the biofilm aging stage it should be noted that the outer biofilm samxa of 0 19 gn gvss d was even higher than that in the total biofilm suggesting that the outer biofilm plays an important role in nitrogen removal the lowest samxa of 0 05 gn gvss d was in the inner biofilm for sludge with large granules substrate transport may limit the biologically active area to the surface of the granule sludge gong et al 2020 the loss of anaob activity in the inner biofilm due to the thickening biofilm was also reported in another study gu et al 2020 in this study the distribution of denitrification bacteria activity was relatively homogeneous at below 0 02 gn gvss d due to free organics in the influent notably the distribution of eps was similar to that of samxa fig 7d as the eps content and anaob activity were closely related wang et al 2020a the eps content in the suspended sludge was 5 53 mg g vss while a higher content of 7 78 mg g vss was found in the total biofilm this was attributed to the crucial role played by eps in the formation and properties of anaob aggregates flemming and wingender 2001 xue et al 2022 the lowest eps concentration at 1 99 mg g vss was detected in the inner biofilm the pn ps ratio increased gradually from 0 90 to 4 70 in the suspended sludge total biofilm outer biofilm and inner suggesting that the sludge properties deteriorated over time the hollow cylinder structure makes the biofilm form mainly on the inner wall of the carrier which reduces the biofilm shedding caused by the shear force of liquid and air at the initial stage of biofilm formation however due to the hollow cylindrical structure the shear forces of liquid and air also resulted in a recessed biofilm this structure reduced the probability of biofilm reformation based on the peeled biofilm resulting in gas pockets cavities formed by n2 accumulation have also been reported in another single stage pn a granular sludge system with wear cracking leading to the reformation of granules wang et al 2021a the high eps content in the granular sludge surface layer can occupy the pore in the surface layer resulting in the deterioration of granular sludge permeability which is unfavorable to mass transfer especially for granular size 1 5 mm xu et al 2021 in this study since the carriers in the mature and aging stages were completely filled with biofilm it can be considered as a granular sludge with a diameter of about 10 mm the outer biofilm can be considered as the surface layer of the granular sludge while a higher eps may lead to a decrease in the permeability of the biofilm and reduce the mass transfer efficiency of the water flow substrate into the inner biofilm for another hollow cylindrical carrier 4 mm in diameter and height it was also found that the microorganisms were distributed only on the sides of the carrier while the inner biofilm was almost inactive guo et al 2020a hence considering the permeability of granular sludge and biofilm thickness it is recommended that the height of the hollow cylindrical carrier be less than 4mm 3 6 2 biofilm reactivation stage the carriers were full of biofilm and there were gas pockets in the inner biofilm before the carriers were treated as discussed in section 3 3 at day 1 after treating the carriers part of the biofilm was separated from the carrier surface in the case of some of the carriers can be seen in fig 8 b in other carriers the visible cracks in the biofilm may have been caused by the rupture of gas pockets after 26 days all of the carriers had lost their inner biofilm due to the collision and were covered by the new biofilm the mlss was reduced from 11 51g l at the biofilm aging stage to 5 86g l at the biofilm reactivation stage however the mlvss was only reduced from 5 75g l to 4 44g l indicating that inorganic matter accounted for the main proportion of sludge loss since the mlvss mlss increased from 0 50 at the biofilm aging stage to 0 76 at the biofilm reactivation stage the biofilm samxa was promoted from 0 21 gn gvss d to 0 28 gn gvss d in the suspended sludge the samxa significantly increased from 0 08 gn gvss d to 0 15 gn gvss d due to the addition of the shed biofilm therefore treatment by mechanical stirring improved the sludge structure of the biofilm and suspended sludge with a higher nitrogen removal ability and system stability it is well known that biofilm formation on the virgin carriers is a long term process wang et al 2021b yang et al 2019 the slow migration of anaob to biofilm accompanied by a poor nre is caused by the do and substrate inhibition qian et al 2021 in this work biofilm growth was divided into 2 periods the first period includes biofilm formation biofilm mature and biofilm aging from phase ⅰ to phase ⅵ the second period includes biofilm reactivation from phase ⅶ to phase ⅷ as explained in section 3 2 for the first period virgin biofilm carrier filamentous bacteria plays the role of connecting single cell aggregation and colony coalescence in the initial formation stage after that the formation of the biofilm was a two process the first step was the promotion of the self proliferation of anaob in initial biofilm and the facilitation of the rapid migration of anaob from suspended sludge to the initial biofilm in the second step reactivation biofilm carrier the initial biofilm formation stage dominated by filamentous bacteria did not take place due to the presence of residual biofilm on the carrier surface after the mechanical stirring treatment the migration and self proliferation of anaob contributed to the reformation of the biofilm and significantly reduced the biofilm formation time 3 7 microbial community composition fig 9 shows the microbial community of the single stage pn a system proteobacteria planctomycetes bacteroidetes chloroflexi chlorobi were the top five bacterial phyla for biofilm and suspended more than 70 the dominant bacterial phylum in biofilm was planctomycetes 29 62 35 68 however the major phylum in suspended sludge was proteobacteria 28 26 34 68 fig 9a this significant difference was due to the anaob in biofilm belong to the planctomycetes while aob belong to the proteobacteria in suspended sludge qian et al 2021 this microbial community difference continued to the order lever fig 9b brocadiales 18 25 32 35 belong to planctomycetes was the major order in biofilm and nitrosomonadales 14 29 22 86 belong to proteobacteria was the major order in the suspended sludge within phylum planctomycetes an anaob function genus candidatus kuenenia and candidatus brocadia were detected the abundance of candidatus brocadia increased from 0 01 of seed sludge to 0 14 in phase ⅰ the high concentration of ammonium throughout the phase ⅰ was conducive to the growth of candidatus brocadia due to its high half saturation constant ks for ammonium oshiki et al 2016 after phase ⅰ candidatus brocadia was gradually screened out of the reactor due to the low effluent ammonium concentration candidatus kuenenia as the dominant anaob genera was identified in the biofilm 18 25 32 31 and suspended sludge 4 10 13 78 anaob was highly enriched in the biofilm due to the anaerobic environment of the biofilm oshiki et al 2016 qian et al 2021 wells et al 2017 the abundance of candidatus kuenenia was only 18 25 in phase ⅵ biofilm aging stage indicating a poor nre was caused by the low anaob abundance at the genera level in the suspended sludge the fraction of candidatus kuenenia decreased significantly from 17 42 in the seed sludge to 4 10 in phase ⅰ suggesting the selective growth of anaob for anaerobic biofilms during the biofilm formation stage after that the abundance of candidatus kuenenia continued to increase from 4 10 in phase ⅰ to 13 78 in phase ⅳ and maintained a high 13 46 in phase ⅷ the high abundance of anaob genera in the suspended sludge ensures the rapid reformation of biofilms while maintaining a stable nre in phase ⅶ biofilm reactivation stage within phylum proteobacteria the aob genera detected were nitrosomonas 0 21 0 52 and nitrosomonas europaea 19 37 24 11 aob maintained a dominant abundance in the suspended sludge 17 86 21 84 during the whole operation the fraction of biofilm in phase ⅰ was only 0 55 then the abundance of aob continued to increase to 5 65 in phase ⅵ it has been reported that enhancing the abundance of aob in biofilm provides an excellent coexistent relationship between aob and anaob which benefits the substrate exchange within the biofilm ahmad et al 2017 chen et al 2018 in this study anaob was highly enhanced in the biofilm while aob was concentrated in the suspended sludge as has been reported in other studies wells et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 however a significant and sustained increase in the abundance of anaob in the suspended sludge and the increase of aob in biofilm were identified in the long term operation the results showed that the mixed growth of anaob and aob in the biofilm and suspended sludge was inevitable an nob abundance nitrospira of 0 06 was identified in the seed sludge and decreased sharply to 0 01 in phase ⅰ after that nob was not detected due to the high nlr due to the organic carbon compounds released by microorganisms such as eps a denitrification bacteria abundance of 0 08 0 26 was also detected in the single stage pn a process kindaichi et al 2012 3 8 implication of this work biofilm carriers are widely used in the single stage pn a process however the long term biofilm formation and the regular replacement of carriers reduces its economic viability therefore modified carriers e g zero valent iron zvi based modified carrier have been used to enhance the attachment of anaob to the carrier and accelerate biofilm formation liu et al 2021 in this study the characteristics of the suspended sludge had an important influence on the formation of biofilm the high mlvss mlss ratio 0 53 0 82 and high anaob abundance 4 1 13 78 of the suspended sludge favored the migration of anaob from the suspended sludge to the carrier surface the importance of suspended sludge characteristics for biofilm formation should be emphasized biofilm separation can be induced by the stirring and the shear force of liquor and air garny et al 2008 zhang et al 2015 in this study it was clearly shown that mechanical stirring treatment can be used to achieve the biofilm reactivation as the biofilm fills with the hollow cylindrical carrier fig 10 niederdorfer et al reported that biofilm formation can be divided into three stages colonization succession and maturation niederdorfer et al 2021 the core community of the previous stage influences the formation of biofilm in the next stage thus making it difficult to accelerate biofilm formation in this study the remaining biofilm of the carrier after mechanical stirring treatment can provide a complete microbial community base for the attachment and growth of anaob without going through a long initial biofilm formation period this can shorten the start up time of biofilm single stage pn a process and enable long term stable operation of the pn a process 4 conclusion in this study the biofilm in a carrier single stage pn a process was successfully characterized the mean nre of the biofilm is 84 1 under an nlr of 0 90 gn l d it was shown that biofilm aging after long term operation was due to the starvation the accumulation of nitrogen gas and hap formation in the biofilm the biofilm was rapidly and successfully reactivated using a biofilm reformation process to strip the biofilm the potential for phosphorus recovery from this removed biofilm was shown to be considerable this research provides an understanding of biofilm formation and provides insight into strategies to reactivate biofilm the results of this study are a valuable resource for the further expansion of the application

16064,biofilm carriers can avoid microorganism washout while maintaining a high amount of biomass but are also associated with a long biofilm formation period and biofilm aging a single stage partial nitritation anammox process single stage pn a reactor was setup to study the biofilm growth characterization and treatment performance under an nlr of 0 53 to 0 90 gn l d over one year biofilm growth was divided into three stages the formation stage maturation stage and aging stage the initial biofilm was observed at day 84 a nitrogen removal efficiency of 83 4 was achieved at an nlr of 0 90 gn l d during the mature biofilm stage starvation nitrogen gas accumulation and hydroxyapatite formation resulted in biofilm aging after mechanical stirring treatment biofilm reactivation was achieved by biofilm re formation within one month there is clear potential for phosphorus recovery as indicated by the 5 24 6 29 phosphorus content in the biofilm similar to the 5 7 phosphorus content in enhanced biological phosphate removal sludge the anaob genera abundance in the biofilm maintained at a high level of 18 25 32 31 while the abundance of anaob increased from the initial 4 10 to 13 78 after mechanical stirring treatment in the suspended sludge ensured biofilm reactivation the results of this study clearly show that mechanical stirring treatment can be used to achieve the biofilm reactivation as the biofilm fills with the hollow cylindrical carrier this study has potential as a useful reference for the realization of the wide application of the biofilm single stage pn a process in the future graphical abstract image graphical abstract keyword single stage partial nitritation anammox carrier hydroxyapatite 1 introduction the anammox process is a promising alternative biological nitrogen removal process it compares well to the traditional nitrification denitrification process and is more economical guo et al 2019 since it is based on the anammox process the single stage partial nitritation anammox process single stage pn a has a space advantage over the double stage pn a process furukawa et al 2006 however there are still bottlenecks in the application of the single stage pn a process the long doubling time 11d of anammox bacteria anaob the synergistic coexistence between ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and anaob and functional bacteria washout with effluent qian et al 2021 flocs granules and biofilm are the biomass types developed for the single stage pn a process in the case of the flocs system the low settling rate of the flocs sludge makes it extremely sensitive to such environmental fluctuations as high organic matter and short hydraulic retention time hrt fluctuations in these factors are known to result in serious sludge washout with poor nitrogen removal performance guo et al 2020a zhang et al 2020 the dense structure of granular sludge has excellent biomass retention ability with superior nitrogen removal performance and facilitates the proliferation of anaob guo and li 2020 however due to the low sludge yield of anaob the formation period of granules is excessively lengthy kartal et al 2012 to maximize the amount of functional bacteria the addition of carriers is common in single stage pn a processes in the treatment of real wastewater yang et al 2021 the high specific surface area of carriers provides an attachment for anaob and aob which avoids sludge washout and maintain high biomass adams et al 2020 for the biofilm single stage pn a process such as moving bed biofilm reactor it is widely reported that anaob is dominant in the biofilm while aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob are dominant in the suspended sludge chen et al 2021 wells et al 2017 azari et al also reported that higher abundance of anaob in suspended sludge than in biofilms in an integrated fixed film activated sludge sequencing batch reactor azari et al 2020 it is possible to choose to achieve the nob suppression by suspended sludge discharge li et al 2019 in a recent study it was demonstrated that the increase of anaob activity and abundance in the biofilm is associated with a reduction in the concentration of the suspended sludge li et al 2021 this indicates that the microbial structure and nitrogen removal pathway of the carrier single stage pn a system can be effectively regulated by the discharge of suspended sludge adding k1 and k3 carriers made of polyethylene can reduce sludge loss to lower levels than those associated with the granular single stage pn a system azari et al 2021 biofilms have been shown to improve the stability tolerance of anaob in mainstream treatment li et al 2021 however in most of the previous studies the focus has been on the effect of different carrier types on the microbial community and the enrichment of anaob in the single stage pn a process such as polyvinylidene chloride biochar polyethylene sponge adams et al 2020 yang et al 2021 only a few studies have been focused on the characteristics of biofilm formation on the carrier surface with a low nitrogen loading rate nlr and limited operation period almstrand et al 2014 yang et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 a distinctive feature of biofilm formation is the thickening of the film itself as the biomass increases however it has been reported that excessive biofilm thickness hinders the anaob from obtaining the substrate and causes the death of the anaob in the inner biofilm ahmad et al 2017 gu et al 2020 in another study stripping of part of the biofilm so that it becomes part of the suspended sludge by the shear force of the liquor and air to form granular sludge was shown to contribute to maintaining the stable operation of the single stage pn a process zhang et al 2015 despite the contribution of these studies to understanding biofilm formation and the risk of biomass loss to carrier biofilms the biofilm mechanism and stable operation strategy are still unclear hollow cylindrical carriers are widely used in the single stage pn a process to enrichment anaob chen et al 2021 chen et al 2018 tatara et al 2017 in the case of granular sludge it has been shown that n2 produced by the anammox reaction accumulates inside the granular sludge causing gas pockets and granular floatation campos et al 2017 wang et al 2021a because the structure of the biofilm inside the hollow cylindrical carriers is similar to granular sludge it is possible that the risk of n2 accumulation and floatation is also similar however this has been the focus of little research in this field it has been reported that the permeability of anaob granules almost disappeared when the granule size exceeded 1 5 mm xu et al 2021 therefore the effect of the size of the hollow cylindrical carriers on the biofilm mass transfer needs to be determined it is also necessary to systematically investigate the requirements for maintaining high activity on hollow cylinder carrier biofilms in this study a hollow cylinder biofilm carrier was used to study and optimize the operational conditions in the single stage pn a process for high strength ammonium wastewater treatment the novelty of this work is twofold 1 it is intended to reveal the characterization of biofilm growth and reasons of its aging and 2 to investigate a simple mechanical stirring treatment strategy for treating hollow cylindrical carriers with aging biofilms and the results are to be used to validate this anammox biofilm reactivation method 2 materials and methods 2 1 biofilm carriers the hollow cylindrical carriers used in this study were made of polypropylene and had a height of 10mm and a diameter of 10mm type of rk 04z098 sumitomo bakelite co ltd japan the specific density and specific surface area were 0 98 g cm3 and 800 m2 m3 respectively 2 2 experiment set up a gas lift reactor glr made of polyethylene with an effective volume of 5 l and a sedimentation volume of 1 l was used in this study fig 1 at day 1 virgin biofilm carriers were added into the reactor with a packing ratio of 25 the operation temperature of the glr reactor was kept at 25 c with a heater an aeration pump was used to provide oxygen to the aob while maintaining the ideal circulation of carriers inside the reactor 2 3 reactor operation the whole operation was divided into 8 phases according to the different nlrs table 1 from phase ⅰ to phase ⅲ the nlr was increased from 0 75 gn l d to 0 9 gn l d and then to 1 20 gn l d to study the rector operation performance under different nlrs ammonium concentrations in high strength ammonium wastewaters such as sludge dewatering liquids typically exceed 500 mg l wang et al 2020b to investigate the performance of the single stage pn a process for treating high ammonium wastewater from phase ⅳ to phase ⅴ the nitrogen removal performance under different influent ammonium concentrations 600mg l and 1000mg l was evaluated phase ⅵ was the inhibition stage phase ⅶ and phase ⅷ were the activity reactivation stage 2 4 synthetic wastewater and inoculum sludge the synthetic wastewater used as the influent was composed of nh4hco3 and the same amount of nahco3 nahco3 was added to supplement the reaction substrate of aob and anaob as well as to supplement the alkalinity the composition of the synthetic wastewater was composed l 1 of 0 081 g kh2po4 0 214 g na2hpo4 12h2o 0 036 g cacl2 2h2o 0 051 g mgcl2 6h2o details of the trace elements can be found in an earlier work guo and li 2020 the seed sludge was collected from the same reactor used for nitrogen removal and phosphorus recovery research based on the hydroxyapatite crystallization anammox process guo and li 2020 the initial mixed liquor volatile suspended solid mlvss concentration was 3 49 g l 2 5 specific activity tests four specific activity tests were used to evaluate the functional bacteria activity changes in different phases such as anaob samxa aob saoa nitrite oxidizing bacteria snoa and denitrification bacteria sda all the measurements were conducted in parallel using the same procedures described in an earlier study chen et al 2018 the reactor potential of the functional bacteria based on the activity tests and mlvss was calculated by eq 1 1 reactor potential gn l d saa gn gmlvss d mlvss g l 2 6 microbial community analysis the sludge samples biofilm and suspended were collected at day 1 and at the end of phase ⅰ phase ⅱ phase ⅴ phase ⅵ and phase ⅷ and to study the microbial community by high throughput sequencing the pcr amplification of the prokaryotic 16s rrna gene was performed with 341f 5 cctacgggnggcwgcag 3 and 805r 5 gactachvgggtatctaatcc 3 dna sequencing was performed using the miseq reagent kit v2 illumina usa of the miseq system at bioengineering lab co ltd kanagawa japan 2 7 chemical analysis and analysis of sludge characterization influent and effluent samples were collected every other day and filtered through a 0 45 μm syringe filter ammonia nitrite and nitrate concentrations were measured by capillary electrophoresis agilent 7100 usa the mlss and mlvss were measured by the standard method apha 2005 a volume of 1 l mixed liquor was poured into a 1 l glass graduated cylinder and the level of the mud liquid interface was recorded after 30 minutes to measure the sv30 sludge volume after 30 min of sedimentation after the sv30 test the mlss and mlvss of the mixed liquor were measured to calculate the sludge volume index svi and the remaining mixed liquor was returned to the reactor extracellular polymeric substances eps were measured by the method outlined in an earlier study xue et al 2020 polysaccharide content was measured using the phenol sulfuric acid method and protein was determined by the lowry method respectively scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive x ray sem edx was used to observe the characterization of biofilm sludge the organic components of the sludge c h o n s were measured by an elemental analyzer elementar germany after the sludge was dried at 105 c overnight raman spectrum and x ray diffraction xrd were used to determine the crystal species in the biofilm sludge then the sludge samples were digested in a microwave digester milestone italy and detected by icp oes agilent 720 usa for the inorganic component ca and p 3 results and discussion 3 1 overall performance of single stage pn a process the operation performance of the reactor is shown in fig 2 in phase ⅰ the mean nitrogen removal efficiency nre increased from 24 96 to 58 20 the ammonium surplus 40mg l 180mg l was the major obstacle to achieving a higher nre throughout phase ⅰ the ammonium surplus led to free ammonia fa concentrations of 16 7 mg l 27 4 mg l which exceeded the 10 inhibition threshold of anaob 15 mg l zhang et al 2016 the nitrite concentration remained below 20mg l at most times and free nitrous acid fna was below 2mg l which was far less than the 10 inhibition threshold of 10μg l for anaob in the case of ammonium surplus and nitrite below 15 mg l ar was increased to promote more nitrite production however the effluent nitrite quickly increased exceeding 50 mg l which indicated the lower activity of anaob limited its ability to utilize more nitrite the adjustment of the ar has been shown to be challenging in the startup of single stage pn a process due to the loss of anaob biomass and its low activity zhang et al 2020 also the local over aeration inside the reactor caused by the non ideal circulation of carriers resulted in nitrite over oxidation under the high nob activity the mean δno3 n δnr in phase ⅰ was 0 14 which was higher than the ideal operation value of 0 11 for the single stage pn a process in phase ⅱ the nlr was adjusted to 0 90 gn l d to stimulate anaob activity a higher nre of 73 6 was achieved after two days of operation indicating that the nitrogen removal performance of the single stage pn a system was significantly enhanced in the short term at a higher nlr a mean nre of 83 30 was obtained in phase ⅱ in phase ⅲ the nlr further increased to 1 20 gn l d however the nre rapidly decreased to 36 75 within 4 days the effluent nitrite increased to 161mg l suggesting that nitrogen overloading resulted in the poor nre the nlr rebounded to 0 90 gn l d in phase ⅳ and the nre recovered to 83 30 within 7 days in phase ⅴ the nlr was kept at 0 90 gn l d and the effect of influent ammonium concentration on the single stage pn a process was evaluated by adjusting the ammonium from 600 mg l to 1000 mg l the average effluent nitrite and nre were 464 17 mg l and 26 90 respectively the ar at the first hrt in phase ⅴ was maintained as it was in phase ⅳ which resulted in the over oxidation of ammonium caused by aob carvajal arroyo et al reported that the 50 inhibitory concentration of nitrite for anaob activity was 384 mg l carvajal arroyo et al 2014 in this study the accumulation of nitrite 464 17 mg l caused severe inhibition of anaob and resulted in ammonium surplus 260 mg l finally the dual inhibition of anaob by fna and fa resulted in the rapid deterioration of the nre in phase ⅵ influent ammonium was reduced to 600mg l the nlr was 0 90 gn l d but the nre was a low 45 the single stage pn a process was only able to achieve stable operation at the influent ammonium of 350mg l with an nlr of 0 53 gn l d this indicates that as much as half the nitrogen removal ability of the single stage pn a process was lost after 300 days of operation the biofilm reactivation biofilm re formation was achieved in two steps in the first step the carriers were treated to mechanical stirring at the nlr of 0 53 gn l d in phase ⅶ the video showing the mechanical stirring treatment is provided in the supplementary material then the carriers and the shed biofilm were all returned to the reactor in the second step the growth of biofilm was promoted by gradually increasing the ammonium concentration in the influent 26 days later the biofilm reactivation was achieved the nlr had returned to 0 90 gn l d in phase ⅷ due to the increase in influent ammonium concentrations to 600mg l within 6 days with a mean nre of 84 8 3 2 morphology characteristics of biofilm the morphological features of the biofilm were examined by camera and sem edx as shown in figs 3 and 4 the holes and bulges on the surface of the carriers are beneficial to the formation of the biofilm since they trap microorganisms almstrand et al 2014 gu et al 2020 at day 84 the read biofilm can be observed on the surface of carriers fig 3b the red color is a striking feature of the anaob and is due to the presence of heme c kang et al 2020 ma et al 2019 this period was regarded as the biofilm formation stage at day 156 the biofilm shows signs of growing from the carrier surface to the center of the carrier fig 3c most noteworthy the outer biofilm had become recessed toward the inner biofilm this unique structure may be caused by the shear force generated by the liquid and air scouring at day 214 the carriers were completely filled with biofilm and the biofilm turned bright red this period was termed the mature biofilm stage the gas pockets found in the core of the biofilm are likely to have resulted from caused by n2 accumulation due to the anammox reaction guo et al 2021 wang et al 2021a at day 310 the biofilm aging stage had begun the biofilm was clearly divided into two colors the outer biofilm was bright read and the inner biofilm was light red it has been reported that the color of the anaob directly reflects the nature of the anaob activity kang et al 2018 the light of the red inner biofilm indicates that the anaob activity is lower than the bright red outer biofilm anaob granules larger than 2mm in diameter are known to be more vulnerable to starvation than smaller granules kindaichi et al 2007 the biofilm inside the carrier was classified as an anaob granule sludge and the 10 mm diameter of biofilm granule was considered to be at risk of starvation pores have been reported for different anaob biomass types in the granules and the biofilms and can benefits substrate dispersion and gas release li et al 2016 wang et al 2021b in this study the pores may have been blocked by the eps due to the excessive biofilm thickness during the biofilm mature stage and may have formed gas pockets at this stage campos et al 2017 the long term accumulation of n2 may have resulted in an increase in the volume of the gas pockets the low anaob activity of the inner biofilm and gas pockets may be factors in the poor nre in phase ⅶ mechanical rupture is an effective strategy to reactivate the floating anaob granular sludge chen et al 2010 at day 312 fig 3f mechanical stirring was used to facilitate the peeling of the aging biofilm and a new biofilm was formed based on the biofilm remaining on the carriers within 30days which was much faster than that in the virgin carrier this period was defined as the biofilm reactivation stage the sem results showed that single cell aggregation colony coalescence and filamentous bacteria coexist in the biofilm at the biofilm formation stage fig 4b filamentous bacteria plays the role of connecting single cell aggregation and colony coalescence in the biofilm mature stage there was an irregular covering of dense granular sludge on the carrier surface in comparison the morphology of the granular sludge had almost disappeared in the biofilm aging stage it was found by sem edx that the elemental concentrations of oxygen calcium and phosphorus had increased significantly from the biofilm mature stage to the biofilm aging stage fig 4e and f this dramatic increase in elemental concentration may be another important factor contributing to the biofilm aging it was reported that the formation of basalt biofilms can be divided into three steps from the growth of single cells to micro colonies to the growth of micro colonies to small biofilms to the growth of biofilms heijnen et al 1992 fig 4b fig s1 and fig 5 c correspond to the above three stages respectively it has been shown that the growth of biofilms on fleece tiles made of synthetic polymeric fibers also can be divided into three distinct stages colonization succession and maturation niederdorfer et al 2021 heterotrophic bacteria form microcolonies in the initial colonization stage and anaob slowly grow into the biofilm in the subsequent succession stage in this study filamentous bacteria played an important role in linking single cells and colonies during biofilm formation stage as reported in another study fig 4b xiao et al 2021 then anaob became the dominant microorganism during biofilm maturation fig 4c as was reported in a recent study niederdorfer et al 2021 however there are few reports on biofilm aging and biofilm reactivation under mainstream conditions the initial biofilm was observed on the surface of the carrier after 230 days of operation wu et al 2021 in another mainstream study it took more than 24 months to form the matured biofilms niederdorfer et al 2021 the slow growth of microorganisms under the mainstream conditions may make it difficult to complete the entire process of biofilm formation mature and aging in one study 3 3 the sludge characteristics the initial mlss of suspended sludge was 6 90 g l fig 5 at day 96 mlss increased to 15 58 g l and the sludge volume index svi was 23 11 ml g the low svi indicates excellent sludge settleability which contributes to a high nrr an nrr of 2 02 gn l d was reported at an svi below 80 ml g in a single stage pn a reactor wang et al 2017b guo et al also reported that an nrr of 1 20 gn l d was successfully kept at an svi below 15 ml g guo and li 2020 to date the highest nrr of 3 90 gn l d for single stage pn a process was achieved in an internal loop air lift reactor with a svi of 78 42 ml g wang et al 2017a a high mlvss was associated with a low svi in these studies 9 0 g l in one study wang et al 2017a and 11 01 g l in another guo and li 2020 in this study the mlvss of suspended sludge was only 3 10 g l at day 96 and the mlvss mlss ratio was at a low 0 20 the high inorganic matter concentration was responsible for the low sludge activity and was not conducive to the initial formation of biofilm on the surface of the carriers from day 97 to day 133 the suspended sludge was discharged to increase the mlvss mlss ratio to 0 53 and reduce the mlss to 2 32 g l after that the mean mlvss of the suspended sludge was 1 67 g l while the average mlvss mlss ratio was 0 68 it should be noted that the svi was in the range of 141 18 ml g to 347 59 ml g the high svi limited the contribution of suspended sludge to the nitrogen removal capacity of the single stage pn a system in the case of the biofilm 0 64 g l mlvss was detected at day 48 thereafter the mlvss increased to 4 40 g l at day 96 which was even higher than that in the suspended sludge at the initial stage of phase ⅶ the mlvss was as high as 5 75g l with an mlvss mlss ratio of 0 50 anaob was more inclined to grow in the biofilm due to the oxygen concentration gradient adams et al 2020 the high mlvss indicates that anaob had a high nitrogen removal ability however the single stage pn a process can only achieve stable operation under an nlr of 0 53 gn l d the poor nlr indicates the properties and structure of biofilm had changed at day 312 in phase ⅶ mechanical stirring treatment resulted in a sharp decrease in the mlvss to 0 22 g l the mlvss recovered to 4 44 g l within 30 days and the nlr readjusted to 0 90 gn l d 3 4 elementary composition of sludge the elementary composition of sludge is shown in table 2 the elemental biomass composition of total biofilm in the biofilm mature stage was ch2o0 67n0 15s0 01ca0 14p0 08 and it was ch2 02o0 86n0 13s0 008ca0 17p0 09 in the biofilm aging stage the carbon content decreased from 30 06 during the mature biofilm stage to 21 66 during the biofilm aging stage suggesting the loss of biomass in the total biofilm the carbon content in inner biofilm was only 22 71 and was 29 41 in outer biofilm this indicates that the biomass was predominantly in the outer biofilm the results of the xrd analysis fig s2 were compared with reference spectra in the database this revealed that hydroxyapatite ca5 po4 3oh hap calcium hydrogen phosphate hydrate ca h2po4 2h2o and calcium phosphate ca3 po4 2 were the major phases in the inner biofilm a raman spectra analysis fig s2 was further used to determine the main crystal only the sludge band of 957 cm 1 was very close to the band of hap at po4 3 1 961cm 1 rey et al 2011 hence the major substance in the inner biofilm was determined to be hap the calcium and phosphorus content were 17 15 and 7 15 in the inner biofilm and 9 20 and 4 30 in the outer biofilm respectively the ca p of outer biofilm was 2 14 which was close to the theoretical ratio of hap 2 15 whereas the ca p in the inner biofilm was much higher at 2 40 the higher ratio was caused by the formation of hap and the starvation caused by the excessive biofilm thickness chen et al 2010 the ca p in the two stages of suspended sludge ranged between 1 45 1 64 and in the total biofilm it was 2 32 2 33 indicating that the hap was mostly distributed in the biofilm hap precipitation is induced by ph and substrate concentration guo and li 2020 magrí et al 2021 the alkaline environment created by the anammox reaction and the organic matter released by microorganisms are both conducive to phosphate biomineralization arias et al 2017 the high abundance of anaob in the biofilm is conducive to the formation of hap aggregation however the nitritation reaction dominated by the aob in the suspended sludge is an acid production process which is not conducive to the accumulation of hap the results of this study show that the suspended sludge was more susceptible to the impact of the external environment than the biofilm nitrogen overload and substrate inhibition are known to result in sludge disintegration and make it difficult for hap to efficiently couple with sludge the phosphorus content in pure anaob process was only 1 4 lotti et al 2014 in this study the phosphorus content in the biofilm was in the range of 5 24 6 29 this phosphorus content is higher than in the pure anaob process and equivalent to the phosphorus content in enhanced biological phosphate removal sludge which is typically between 5 and 7 yuan et al 2012 after mechanical stirring treatment most of the stripped biofilm can be utilized for phosphorus recovery and the other part of the biofilm can be returned to the single stage pn a reactor to maintain the stable operation of the single stage pn a process this study provided a new way to remove phosphorus from wastewater using a biofilm single stage pn a process 3 5 specific activity tests and reactor potential the saoa values of the suspended sludge were all above 2 30 gn gvss d and the lowest reactor potential of 2 0 gn l d was higher than the highest nlr of 1 20 gn l d fig 6 as shown in table 3 the saoa was significantly higher than the samxa reported in other biofilm single stage pn a systems chen et al 2018 guo et al 2020b this suggests that as functional bacteria aob is not the major limiting factor in the biofilm single stage pn a process due to the oxygen concentration gradient the same phenomena can be found in suspended single stage pn a process chen et al 2020 chini et al 2016 however a significantly higher samxa than saoa and a relative equilibrium between samxa and saoa were also observed akaboci et al 2018 wu et al 2016 therefore the suspended single stage pn a process has a higher risk of unstable operation caused by sludge washout the samxa of the biofilm decreased from 0 29 gn gvss d at day 84 to 0 11 gn gvss d at day 138 this was likely due to the loss in the biofilm biomass caused by the impinging of the carriers after the discharge of the suspended sludge in another study a short hrt of 2 h also resulted in biomass loss in biofilm chen et al 2021 the reduction in samxa from 0 21 gn gvss d in phase ⅳ to 0 12 gn gvss d found in phase ⅶ was caused by biofilm aging the samxa in the different types of sludge and reactors were all below 0 4 gn gvss d under 25 c table 3 a poor nre has been shown to be accompanied by a lower saa akaboci et al 2018 chini et al 2016 in this study the samxa of suspended sludge were all below 0 15 gn gvss d hence the constant and high samxa activity of the biofilm plays a crucial role in the stable operation of the single stage pn a system after mechanical stirring the samxa of the biofilm recovered to 0 28 gn gvss d in phase ⅷ the highest snoa of 0 35 gn gvss d at day 84 was attributed to the local over aeration inside the reactor after sludge discharge and under high nlr inhibition the snoa was kept below 0 20 gn gvss d unstable operation can result in the anaob releasing more eps which can be used by heterotrophic bacteria kindaichi et al 2012 wang et al 2020a with the increase in nre from 24 96 to 84 80 the sda significantly decreased from 0 20 gn gvss d in phase ⅰ to 0 05 gn gvss d in phase ⅷ 3 6 the sludge characteristics in the biofilm aging and reactivation stages 3 6 1 biofilm aging stage the biomass distribution in the biofilm aging stage was not homogeneous the mlvss in the suspended sludge was 0 88 g l and 1 82 g l in the total biofilm fig 7 b however the mlss increased significantly from 1 30 g l to 6 90 g l the mlvss mlss ratio showed a downward trend from 0 72 to 0 18 in the suspended sludge total biofilm outer biofilm and inner biofilm the samxa of the total biofilm was 0 15 gn gvss d and 0 08 gn gvss d in the suspended sludge fig 7c the results showed that the anaob activity in the biofilm was still superior to that in suspended sludge even during the biofilm aging stage it should be noted that the outer biofilm samxa of 0 19 gn gvss d was even higher than that in the total biofilm suggesting that the outer biofilm plays an important role in nitrogen removal the lowest samxa of 0 05 gn gvss d was in the inner biofilm for sludge with large granules substrate transport may limit the biologically active area to the surface of the granule sludge gong et al 2020 the loss of anaob activity in the inner biofilm due to the thickening biofilm was also reported in another study gu et al 2020 in this study the distribution of denitrification bacteria activity was relatively homogeneous at below 0 02 gn gvss d due to free organics in the influent notably the distribution of eps was similar to that of samxa fig 7d as the eps content and anaob activity were closely related wang et al 2020a the eps content in the suspended sludge was 5 53 mg g vss while a higher content of 7 78 mg g vss was found in the total biofilm this was attributed to the crucial role played by eps in the formation and properties of anaob aggregates flemming and wingender 2001 xue et al 2022 the lowest eps concentration at 1 99 mg g vss was detected in the inner biofilm the pn ps ratio increased gradually from 0 90 to 4 70 in the suspended sludge total biofilm outer biofilm and inner suggesting that the sludge properties deteriorated over time the hollow cylinder structure makes the biofilm form mainly on the inner wall of the carrier which reduces the biofilm shedding caused by the shear force of liquid and air at the initial stage of biofilm formation however due to the hollow cylindrical structure the shear forces of liquid and air also resulted in a recessed biofilm this structure reduced the probability of biofilm reformation based on the peeled biofilm resulting in gas pockets cavities formed by n2 accumulation have also been reported in another single stage pn a granular sludge system with wear cracking leading to the reformation of granules wang et al 2021a the high eps content in the granular sludge surface layer can occupy the pore in the surface layer resulting in the deterioration of granular sludge permeability which is unfavorable to mass transfer especially for granular size 1 5 mm xu et al 2021 in this study since the carriers in the mature and aging stages were completely filled with biofilm it can be considered as a granular sludge with a diameter of about 10 mm the outer biofilm can be considered as the surface layer of the granular sludge while a higher eps may lead to a decrease in the permeability of the biofilm and reduce the mass transfer efficiency of the water flow substrate into the inner biofilm for another hollow cylindrical carrier 4 mm in diameter and height it was also found that the microorganisms were distributed only on the sides of the carrier while the inner biofilm was almost inactive guo et al 2020a hence considering the permeability of granular sludge and biofilm thickness it is recommended that the height of the hollow cylindrical carrier be less than 4mm 3 6 2 biofilm reactivation stage the carriers were full of biofilm and there were gas pockets in the inner biofilm before the carriers were treated as discussed in section 3 3 at day 1 after treating the carriers part of the biofilm was separated from the carrier surface in the case of some of the carriers can be seen in fig 8 b in other carriers the visible cracks in the biofilm may have been caused by the rupture of gas pockets after 26 days all of the carriers had lost their inner biofilm due to the collision and were covered by the new biofilm the mlss was reduced from 11 51g l at the biofilm aging stage to 5 86g l at the biofilm reactivation stage however the mlvss was only reduced from 5 75g l to 4 44g l indicating that inorganic matter accounted for the main proportion of sludge loss since the mlvss mlss increased from 0 50 at the biofilm aging stage to 0 76 at the biofilm reactivation stage the biofilm samxa was promoted from 0 21 gn gvss d to 0 28 gn gvss d in the suspended sludge the samxa significantly increased from 0 08 gn gvss d to 0 15 gn gvss d due to the addition of the shed biofilm therefore treatment by mechanical stirring improved the sludge structure of the biofilm and suspended sludge with a higher nitrogen removal ability and system stability it is well known that biofilm formation on the virgin carriers is a long term process wang et al 2021b yang et al 2019 the slow migration of anaob to biofilm accompanied by a poor nre is caused by the do and substrate inhibition qian et al 2021 in this work biofilm growth was divided into 2 periods the first period includes biofilm formation biofilm mature and biofilm aging from phase ⅰ to phase ⅵ the second period includes biofilm reactivation from phase ⅶ to phase ⅷ as explained in section 3 2 for the first period virgin biofilm carrier filamentous bacteria plays the role of connecting single cell aggregation and colony coalescence in the initial formation stage after that the formation of the biofilm was a two process the first step was the promotion of the self proliferation of anaob in initial biofilm and the facilitation of the rapid migration of anaob from suspended sludge to the initial biofilm in the second step reactivation biofilm carrier the initial biofilm formation stage dominated by filamentous bacteria did not take place due to the presence of residual biofilm on the carrier surface after the mechanical stirring treatment the migration and self proliferation of anaob contributed to the reformation of the biofilm and significantly reduced the biofilm formation time 3 7 microbial community composition fig 9 shows the microbial community of the single stage pn a system proteobacteria planctomycetes bacteroidetes chloroflexi chlorobi were the top five bacterial phyla for biofilm and suspended more than 70 the dominant bacterial phylum in biofilm was planctomycetes 29 62 35 68 however the major phylum in suspended sludge was proteobacteria 28 26 34 68 fig 9a this significant difference was due to the anaob in biofilm belong to the planctomycetes while aob belong to the proteobacteria in suspended sludge qian et al 2021 this microbial community difference continued to the order lever fig 9b brocadiales 18 25 32 35 belong to planctomycetes was the major order in biofilm and nitrosomonadales 14 29 22 86 belong to proteobacteria was the major order in the suspended sludge within phylum planctomycetes an anaob function genus candidatus kuenenia and candidatus brocadia were detected the abundance of candidatus brocadia increased from 0 01 of seed sludge to 0 14 in phase ⅰ the high concentration of ammonium throughout the phase ⅰ was conducive to the growth of candidatus brocadia due to its high half saturation constant ks for ammonium oshiki et al 2016 after phase ⅰ candidatus brocadia was gradually screened out of the reactor due to the low effluent ammonium concentration candidatus kuenenia as the dominant anaob genera was identified in the biofilm 18 25 32 31 and suspended sludge 4 10 13 78 anaob was highly enriched in the biofilm due to the anaerobic environment of the biofilm oshiki et al 2016 qian et al 2021 wells et al 2017 the abundance of candidatus kuenenia was only 18 25 in phase ⅵ biofilm aging stage indicating a poor nre was caused by the low anaob abundance at the genera level in the suspended sludge the fraction of candidatus kuenenia decreased significantly from 17 42 in the seed sludge to 4 10 in phase ⅰ suggesting the selective growth of anaob for anaerobic biofilms during the biofilm formation stage after that the abundance of candidatus kuenenia continued to increase from 4 10 in phase ⅰ to 13 78 in phase ⅳ and maintained a high 13 46 in phase ⅷ the high abundance of anaob genera in the suspended sludge ensures the rapid reformation of biofilms while maintaining a stable nre in phase ⅶ biofilm reactivation stage within phylum proteobacteria the aob genera detected were nitrosomonas 0 21 0 52 and nitrosomonas europaea 19 37 24 11 aob maintained a dominant abundance in the suspended sludge 17 86 21 84 during the whole operation the fraction of biofilm in phase ⅰ was only 0 55 then the abundance of aob continued to increase to 5 65 in phase ⅵ it has been reported that enhancing the abundance of aob in biofilm provides an excellent coexistent relationship between aob and anaob which benefits the substrate exchange within the biofilm ahmad et al 2017 chen et al 2018 in this study anaob was highly enhanced in the biofilm while aob was concentrated in the suspended sludge as has been reported in other studies wells et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 however a significant and sustained increase in the abundance of anaob in the suspended sludge and the increase of aob in biofilm were identified in the long term operation the results showed that the mixed growth of anaob and aob in the biofilm and suspended sludge was inevitable an nob abundance nitrospira of 0 06 was identified in the seed sludge and decreased sharply to 0 01 in phase ⅰ after that nob was not detected due to the high nlr due to the organic carbon compounds released by microorganisms such as eps a denitrification bacteria abundance of 0 08 0 26 was also detected in the single stage pn a process kindaichi et al 2012 3 8 implication of this work biofilm carriers are widely used in the single stage pn a process however the long term biofilm formation and the regular replacement of carriers reduces its economic viability therefore modified carriers e g zero valent iron zvi based modified carrier have been used to enhance the attachment of anaob to the carrier and accelerate biofilm formation liu et al 2021 in this study the characteristics of the suspended sludge had an important influence on the formation of biofilm the high mlvss mlss ratio 0 53 0 82 and high anaob abundance 4 1 13 78 of the suspended sludge favored the migration of anaob from the suspended sludge to the carrier surface the importance of suspended sludge characteristics for biofilm formation should be emphasized biofilm separation can be induced by the stirring and the shear force of liquor and air garny et al 2008 zhang et al 2015 in this study it was clearly shown that mechanical stirring treatment can be used to achieve the biofilm reactivation as the biofilm fills with the hollow cylindrical carrier fig 10 niederdorfer et al reported that biofilm formation can be divided into three stages colonization succession and maturation niederdorfer et al 2021 the core community of the previous stage influences the formation of biofilm in the next stage thus making it difficult to accelerate biofilm formation in this study the remaining biofilm of the carrier after mechanical stirring treatment can provide a complete microbial community base for the attachment and growth of anaob without going through a long initial biofilm formation period this can shorten the start up time of biofilm single stage pn a process and enable long term stable operation of the pn a process 4 conclusion in this study the biofilm in a carrier single stage pn a process was successfully characterized the mean nre of the biofilm is 84 1 under an nlr of 0 90 gn l d it was shown that biofilm aging after long term operation was due to the starvation the accumulation of nitrogen gas and hap formation in the biofilm the biofilm was rapidly and successfully reactivated using a biofilm reformation process to strip the biofilm the potential for phosphorus recovery from this removed biofilm was shown to be considerable this research provides an understanding of biofilm formation and provides insight into strategies to reactivate biofilm the results of this study are a valuable resource for the further expansion of the application of the carrier single stage pn a process to the treatment of wastewater containing phosphorus declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial
