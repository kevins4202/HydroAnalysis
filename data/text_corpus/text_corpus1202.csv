6010,the effects of urbanization and scales on submarine groundwater discharge sgd remain poorly understood here we used radium isotopes to quantify sgd derived fluxes of nitrogen phosphorus and dissolved organic carbon doc into sydney harbour estuary australia sydney is the most populated city of oceania with several localised cases of historical groundwater pollution we sampled top and bottom waters at the harbour scale 20 km and also at four small scale embayments 2 km a decreasing gradient in radium isotope concentrations from upstream to downstream was observed mass balances constructed with 224ra 223ra and 226ra revealed that total sgd ranged from 42 to 121 104 m3 d 1 depending on assumptions and isotope these fluxes were related mostly to saline sgd recirculated seawater and are equivalent to 60 times the mean annual freshwater river discharge into sydney harbour 0 68 104 m3 d 1 the estimated sgd rates 2 2 1 5 cm d 1 were comparable to the global average radium derived sgd in other urban estuaries 3 1 cm d 1 no obvious relationships were observed between sgd and scale in sydney harbour however higher sgd rates estimated for embayments closer to the ocean indicate that a combination of waves tides and urbanization control sgd sgd derived fluxes exceeded maximum riverine nutrient fluxes by a factor of 2 for doc 6 for po4 3 40 for nh4 and 1 3 for nox previous work has suggested that nutrients enter sydney harbour primarily through rivers or stormwater following episodic rain events our results imply that diffuse saline sgd can also be an important but overlooked source of nutrients potentially sustaining primary productivity in times of no river flow keywords urban estuaries coastal aquifers subterranean estuary radium isotopes porewater 1 introduction accelerated urban development is significantly impacting marine ecosystems with the largest megacities in the globe located on the coast lee et al 2006 some of the most noticeable impacts are associated with increases in riverine inputs of nutrients and pollutants syvitski and kettner 2011 zhang et al 1999 nutrients can also be exported to the ocean via submarine groundwater discharge sgd on local crotwell and moore 2003 regional paiva and niencheski 2018 and global cho et al 2018 scales however sgd inputs have received far less attention in part because sgd is more difficult to quantify than riverine fluxes seepage meters piezometers natural geochemical traces water balances and numerical modelling have been used to estimate sgd burnett et al 2006 the development of isotopic radon and radium isotopes techniques in the 1990s burnett et al 2001 moore 1997 moore and arnold 1996 has led to an increase in sgd investigations in the coastal ocean and estuaries sgd has been demonstrated to be a major source of nutrients anwar et al 2014 moore 2010 slomp and van cappellen 2004 greenhouse gasses sadat noori et al 2018 and heavy metals knee and paytan 2011 in several locations around the world sgd has been assessed in a broad range of habitats such as saltmarshes krest et al 2000 mangroves mcgowan and martin 2007 sanders et al 2012 tait et al 2016 river deltas peterson et al 2008 coral reefs mcmahon and santos 2017 lagoons santos et al 2008 estuaries moore et al 2006 and the continental shelf moore et al 2008 overall these studies highlight not only the biogeochemical importance of sgd but also the need to distinguish processes occurring at different scales bratton 2010 cerdà domènech et al 2017 and the influence of urbanization adyasari et al 2018 burnett et al 2009 luo et al 2014 effective sgd assessments may require an understanding of governing processes at multiple scales bratton 2010 santos et al 2012 wilson 2005 three major scales has been assessed shelf 10 km embayment 10 km and nearshore 10 m scales bratton 2010 even though ocean basin scale sgd estimates are now available chen et al 2019 cho et al 2018 kwon et al 2014 moore et al 2008 rodellas et al 2015 at the shelf scale sgd is dominated by topographic driven flow from up to tens of kilometres inland wilson 2005 and typically consists of fresh water flow burnett et al 2006 the embayment scale sgd is driven by processes in the upper unconfined aquifer and the upper confined aquifer tides and sea level changes at the nearshore scale waves and tides play a relatively more important role in driving saline sgd fluxes nearshore scale processes often occur between the high tide line and the bottom of the upper confining layer of the coastal aquifer sgd off beaches often occurs via the filtration of large amounts of saline water in permeable sediments making this scale crucial from biogeochemical and water quality perspectives bratton 2010 accelerated global urbanization along coastal margins has the potential to impact sgd across all of these scales impacts of urbanization have been assessed for aquifers and estuaries with little data on how it may alter sgd and related nutrient fluxes major impacts of urbanization on coastal aquifers include 1 modification of aquifer recharge rates due to change in land cover and hydraulic connectivity hayashi et al 2009 sharp et al 2008 2 depletion of groundwater levels potentially leading to saltwater intrusion hayashi et al 2009 3 and changes in groundwater chemistry due to infiltration of pollutants sharp et al 2008 impacts on estuaries include direct impacts on the estuary chemistry and modification of hydrological and sediment transport regimes feely et al 2010 lee et al 2006 how sgd is affected by urbanization remains poorly understood in this study we hypothesise that sgd releases groundwater pollutants to surface waters in a heavily urbanized estuary sydney harbour australia we assessed the spatial variability of sgd and its associated nutrient fluxes by solving radium mass balances with map algebra three radium isotopes 223ra 224ra and 226ra were employed to quantify saline sgd over different spatial scales sgd derived nutrient fluxes were estimated for dissolved inorganic nitrogen din phosphorus dip and dissolved organic carbon doc our estimates were compared at two spatial scales harbour scale and embayments scale and to other major urban systems around the globe 2 study site this study was conducted in may 2018 in sydney harbour fig 1 by sampling waters from the parramatta river weir in western sydney 33 81309 151 0097 to the harbour mouth 33 8282 151 2781 28 km fig 1 we also performed higher resolution sampling in four small embayments homebush bay hen and chicken bay rozelle bay and rose bay to analyse the effects of spatial scales on sgd and identify potential hotspots related to different land uses table 1 our study is representative of dry conditions only 23 2 mm of rain falling in the month prior to sampling which is equivalent to 19 of the average rainfall for the month 117 mm and 2 of the mean annual average 1222 mm http www bom gov au sampling in dry conditions implies that our radium observations trace mostly saline rather than fresh sgd and prevent river inputs from confounding interpretations in the radium mass balance sydney harbour is a microtidal estuary that bisects sydney the most populated city in oceania 5 millions inhabitants the estuary has low fresh water inputs 6750 m3 d 1 on average that come mostly from episodic rainfall events lee et al 2011 the estuary catchment area is 500 km2 with 50 km2 of water surface area the surface area of fresh water channels within the catchment is only about 4 of the total estuary area tanner et al 2017 90 of the estuary catchment is urbanised which has reduced the infiltration capacity of its soils and increased surface runoff and storm water pollution hose et al 2005 homebush bay in the western end of the harbour is a heavily industrialised area with historical groundwater pollution largely due to the burial of domestic industrial and commercial waste approximately 9 mt of waste have been deposited in this embayment since early in the 20th century including heavy metals and agent orange suh et al 2004 hen and chicken bay is a relatively shallow embayment characterized by medium density residential surroundings rozelle bay s catchment contains sydney s main commercial and business district and its substrate has been highly modified with man made fills and retention walls along the shoreline table 1 finally rose bay near the mouth of the harbour is characterized by dense residential areas and sandy beaches fig 1 3 methods 3 1 sampling and analysis we collected 105 samples from 15th to 25th may 2018 on a catamaran type vessel within the harbour samples were collected from 20 locations along the main axis of the harbour fig 1 at each of these locations we collected top and bottom samples other 33 locations were sampled within selected embayments 33 top samples and five bottom samples when depths 2 m top samples were collected from within one meter of the surface and bottom samples were collected from one meter above the bottom sediments seven freshwater samples were collected to estimate radium desorption in four creeks and the parramatta river and 21 groundwater samples to estimate radium carbon and nutrient endmembers at each surface sampling station we measured salinity depth profiles using an ysi castaway ctd we sampled radium isotopes by filtering 100 l of surface water or 6 l of groundwater through 15 g of manganese mn fibers moore and reid 1973 in the laboratory mn fibers were rinsed with radium free water to remove salts and particles partially dried and analysed with a radium delayed coincidence counter radecc for 223ra and 224ra moore and arnold 1996 samples were then sealed for one month in gas tight cartridges allowing the ingrowth of 222rn from 226ra decay peterson et al 2008 and analysed again using a radecc for 226ra radium isotopes are released at high salinities making them ideal tracers of saline sgd hatje et al 2017 swarzenski et al 2007 boreholes n 21 were dug in the intertidal zone during low tide to collect groundwater samples bore depths were variable as we dug until the water table was reached usually between 0 5 and 2 m and then dug for another 0 5 m to collect the water that is most likely to exchange with the surface after digging we inserted a 3 pvc pipe with a polypropylene geotextile screen 0 5 m from the bottom we purged the well three times with a peristaltic pump ensuring the collection of new groundwater and allowing for suspended particles to settle to measure nutrients dissolved inorganic nitrogen din nh4 nox and dissolved inorganic phosphorus dip po4 2 we syringed 40 ml of sample through 0 45 µm cellulose acetate filters nucleopore into 10 ml plastic vials samples were frozen and taken to the laboratory for analysis using a lachat flow injection analyser with analytical uncertainties 5 for dissolved organic carbon doc 30 ml of water were filtered through 0 7 µm whatman gf f filters into acid and pre combusted 450 c for 4 h borosilicate vials containing 100 µl of saturated hgcl2 3 2 radium diffusion from sediments and desorption in order to estimate radium desorbed from fresh water we sampled four tributaries entering sydney harbour fig 1 first we passed 30 l of fresh water salinity 0 5ppt through 15 g of mn fibers at 1 l min salt was added to a second 30 l container until salinity exceeded 30 after three hours we filtered the salt infused water through mn fibers the difference of concentration between radium in salted samples and unsalted samples was assumed to be equivalent to desorption peterson et al 2008 radium contamination resulting from the addition of salt was assumed to be zero as it has been found to be undetectable in our previous similar experiments sadat noori et al 2018 stewart et al 2015 water discharge for the creeks was obtained from the water nsw service https realtimedata waternsw com au water stm to characterize diffusion from bottom sediments we collected eight sediment samples along the length of the harbour fig 1 we took 500 ml of each sediment sample and mixed it with 6 5 l of radium free seawater the sediment was incubated for 60 days to establish secular equilibrium between short lived radium isotope decay and the sediment source peterson et al 2008 the overlying water was then filtered through mn impregnated fibres and analysed using the radecc this method was only applied to 224ra and 223ra because 226ra has a very long half life 1600 yr stewart et al 2018 we assume that after 5 half lives radioactive decay only radium sink is equivalent to diffusion only radium source 3 3 radium ages radium ages were calculated based on the activity ratio ar of a short lived to a longer lived radium isotope moore 2000 the method relies on a constant initial ratio in the source ari gathered from the groundwater samples relative to a specific surface water sample arobs three possible ratios were used 224ra 223ra 223ra 226ra and 224ra 226ra for each of these ratios we estimated residence times using the average minimum and maximum groundwater ratio in order to quantify a potential range of radium ages radium ages t were then calculated using 1 t ln ar i ar obs x 1 λ short l i v e d λ long l i v e d where λ represents the decay constant of the ra isotope this approach relies on the assumption that 1 the major source of radium is groundwater and 2 the estimated apparent radium ages represents the time since the seawater sample was in contact with the source 3 4 sgd estimates to estimate sgd flux qgw m3 d 1 the harbour area was divided into pixels of 39 24 39 24 m and used map algebra to solve the following equations moore s 2006 approach was used to solve a radium mass balance fig 2 2 q gw 1 n ra n v n t 1 n ra n λ v n q riv ra riv ra des ra dif ra gw where n is any interpolated pixel ra n is the concentration of ra at any n pixel dpm m 3 vn is the volume of the water column at that pixel m3 t is the average residence time of the harbour days d λ d 1 is the decay constant of ra qriv is the river discharge m3 d 1 ra riv is the ra at the river dpm m 3 ra des is the desorbed ra ra dif is the diffusion in the whole harbour dpm m 3 and ra gw is the average ra concentration of the endmembers from groundwater to minimize potential uncertainties associated with spatial distribution we generated maps of radium concentration by applying ordinary kriging wackernagel 2003 the mass balance was then integrated for each area of interest the whole sydney harbour and the four embayments we estimated sgd fluxes in units of m3 d 1 and sgd rates in units of cm d 1 often referred as specific sgd using the area of each system table 1 we estimated sgd derived nutrient fluxes as has been done elsewhere charette and buesseler 2004 cho et al 2018 hwang et al 2016 lee et al 2008 qu et al 2017 using 3 potential n u t r i e n t f l u x q gw nutrient gw where q gw is the derived sgd flux estimated in the mass balance equation eq 3 and nutrient gw is the groundwater endmembers µmol l 1 the nutrient gw term was defined as the difference between the average groundwater concentration and the average surface water concentration because saline sgd or seawater recirculation in beach sediments dominates total sgd see below this approach to quantify the nutrient endmember resolves the net nutrient fluxes resulting from saline sgd and prevents us from overestimating sgd derived nutrient and carbon fluxes to the ocean santos et al 2014 uncertainties in the estimations of sgd and associated nutrient and carbon fluxes were calculated by using the harvard 2007 method for error propagation 4 results 4 1 ancillary data temperature within the surface waters of the harbour varied between 14 9 and 18 5 c with the highest temperatures closest to the estuary mouth salinity ranged from 25 6 to 35 6 with the lowest salinities observed in the upper harbour near the parramatta river relatively uniform salinity and temperature vertical profiles indicated no significant stratification during the sampling fig 3 the mean annual river discharge of parramatta river haslam creek white creek and johnstone creek combined was 7700 m3 d 1 4 2 radium isotopes a decreasing gradient in radium isotope concentrations was observed towards the mouth of the harbour fig 4 the upper harbour homebush bay and hen and chicken bay had the highest concentrations of 223ra at 4 2 dpm 100 l with a maximum of 6 1 dmp 100 l while rozelle bay and rose bay concentrations were about half the upper harbour a minimum concentration of 223ra 0 1 dmp 100 l was observed close to the ocean no vertical stratification was observed for 223ra similar spatial trends were observed for 224ra and 226ra however vertical stratification of both isotopes was apparent in the upper harbour with higher concentrations in bottom waters than in the surface 224ra concentrations ranged between 0 3 and 126 dpm 100 l while 226ra concentrations ranged between 8 3 and 15 9 dpm 100 l fig 6 in groundwater samples the average 223ra and 224ra concentration was 12 times higher than surface waters concentrations while the average 226ra concentration was approximately four times higher average riverine 223ra and 224ra concentrations were about seven times lower than brackish saline harbour surface waters while average 226ra concentrations were comparable average diffusion fluxes of radium from sediments n 8 was 1 7 0 5 dpm m2 d 1 for 223ra and 80 25 dpmm 2d 1 for 224ra we assume that 226ra diffusion was 0 42 dpm m2 d 1 based on global average estimates liu et al 2014 4 3 nutrients and doc high concentrations of doc 160 µmol l were localized in four areas the upper harbour hen and chicken bay rose bay and the bottom waters of the lower harbour fig 5 hen and chicken bay and rose bay are residential areas indicating potential input of domestic wastewaters or leakage of underground waste pipelines an area of high po4 3 concentrations was seen in the upper harbour between homebush bay and hen and chicken 0 5 1 0 µmol l similar to doc a second hotspot of po4 3 was observed in bottom waters of the lower harbour fig 5 nh4 concentrations ranged from 2 1 to 4 5 µmol l while nox ranged between 0 2 and 0 7 µmol l and were both lowest in rose bay contrary to doc and po4 3 nh4 and nox were lowest in the bottom waters of the lower harbour fig 5 all groundwater samples had higher concentrations of nutrients and doc than surface waters fig 6 doc had average concentrations of 263 175 µmol l po4 3 had an average concentration of 1 7 2 2 µmol l and nh4 and nox had average concentrations of 37 127 and 19 47 µmol l respectively fig 6 fresh riverine samples had low concentrations of po4 3 0 5 0 5 µmol l and nh4 2 3 3 5 µmol l when compared to saline surface waters but relatively high concentrations of doc and nox 510 88 and 46 31 µmol l fig 6 4 4 radium ages mass balance and nutrient fluxes calculating residence times was necessary to estimate the export of radium to the ocean and build a radium mass balance fig 2 we estimated apparent residence times by using three different isotope ratio combinations 224ra 223ra 223ra 226ra and 224ra 226ra table 2 by using the minimum groundwater ratios radium ages were estimated to range from 1 3 to 3 4 days which is unrealistic compared to previous studies das et al 2000 the most conservative residence times were obtained by using the maximum ratio in groundwater samples between 223ra 226ra with an average of 36 7 days and a maximum of 70 days fig 7 by using 223ra 226ra the net export of radium for the whole harbour was estimated to be 576 357 106 dpm d 1 we directly estimated diffusion by incubating sediments samples in the laboratory the measured diffusion from each embayment was a negligible source of 226ra undetected minimum source of 223ra 62 35 106 dpm d 1 and moderate source of 224ra 5966 3878 106 dpm d 1 after subtracting all the sources of radium diffusion from sediments decay and riverine input from the export of radium to the ocean the remaining radium flux was attributed to sgd fig 2 sgd fluxes ranged between 42 and 121 104 m3 d 1 with an average rate of 2 2 1 5 cm d 1 table 3 for all the embayments the largest fluxes were estimated using 226ra while the smallest with 224ra average sgd fluxes m3 d 1 were comparable between embayments hen and chicken bay rozelle bay and rose bay had fluxes in the same order of magnitude 1 7 and 4 9 104 m3 d 1 homebush bay had the lowest fluxes at 0 5 0 2 104 m3 d 1 sgd rates cm d 1 increased towards the ocean where sediments are sandier and tides and waves had more influence homebush bay had the lowest sgd rates at 0 4 0 1 cm d 1 while rose bay had the highest at 2 5 1 7 cm d 1 table 2 fig 8 the estimated nutrient fluxes indicate sgd delivered between 124 and 203 103 mol d 1 of doc between 0 7 103 and 1 2 103 mol d 1 of po4 3 from 26 103 to 44 103 mol d 1 of nh4 and from 8 103 to 14 103 mol d 1 of nox table 4 this corresponds to 5 1 t y 1 of doc 33 9 t y 1 of dip and 1570 408 t y 1 of din dividing these fluxes by the area of the harbour sgd nutrient fluxes were estimated at 4 1 103 µmol m2 d 1 of doc 27 7 µmol m2 d 1 of po4 3 963 250 µmol m2 d 1 of nh4 and 315 82 µmol m2 d 1 of nox within embayments doc ranged between 292 and 2931 µmol m2 d 1 while for the rest of the nutrients rozelle bay had the highest flux rates po4 3 45 nh4 3 5 103 and nox 1 2 103 µmol m2 d 1 fig 8 negative sgd fluxes of nh4 were observed in homebush bay 9 3 and rose bay 15 6 indicating that sgd was possibly acting as a sink by consuming nitrogen during seawater circulation in beach sediments 5 discussion 5 1 uncertainties in sgd estimates natural tracer derived estimates of sgd are often subject to inherent uncertainties unresolved temporal and spatial variability unquantified sources of radium endmember natural variability and residence times are among the most common sources of uncertainty knee and paytan 2011 santos et al 2009 here we discuss how we approached these uncertainties to offer a potential range in sgd estimates rather than an absolute value previous studies have estimated sgd by using temporal cerdà domènech et al 2017 jeffrey et al 2016 and spatial observations stewart et al 2015 and some have relied on both adyasari et al 2018 sadat noori et al 2015 our spatial approach allowed for a comparison among different embayments with sgd rates representative of processes occurring within the isotope half life or system s residence time to develop mass balances estuaries can be divided in volumetric units simplifying its geometry for example sadat noori et al 2015 estimated sgd fluxes by dividing an estuary with a homogeneous channel geometry in four boxes resulting in estimated sgd uncertainties of only 23 estuaries with complex geometry and circulation patterns are more challenging in order to deal with this in sydney harbour we solved the mass balance equation pixel by pixel within the harbour and its embayments this approach gave us confidence when estimating the radium inventories in the system ignoring different sources of radium also leads to uncertainty in the estimation of sgd stewart et al 2015 we analysed radium inputs from fresh water creeks and radium diffused directly from the sediments in the bottom of the harbour combined these sources accounted for an average of 10 9 of radium sources highlighting that sgd was the major source of the three radium isotopes sydney harbour receives most of its fresh water during storms lee et al 2011 using the average annual freshwater input and radium concentrations observed during our survey dissolved and desorbed radium inputs would account for 0 1 of radium sources by assuming the maximum river discharge registered for the parramatta river 121 973 m3 d 1 riverine radium inputs would account for a maximum of 2 5 of estimated 226ra losses therefore any uncertainties in river inputs or desorption play only a minor role in final sgd estimates the sewage input into the harbour was assumed to be an negligible source of radium as sydney releases treated sewage offshore and radium concentrations in sewage have been reported to be minimal in previous studies in the us beck et al 2007 the major source of uncertainty in the estimation of saline sgd is usually related to the groundwater endmember moore and arnold 1996 sadat noori et al 2018 santos et al 2009 concentration of natural tracers in groundwater have previously been reported to have a large spatial variability peterson et al 2008 schmidt et al 2010 however increasing sample size reduces uncertainties for example a previous study found that at least 12 groundwater samples may be enough to stabilize standard errors sadat noori et al 2015 we collected 21 groundwater samples spatially distributed along the harbour and embayments with high standard deviation 223ra 30 224ra 23 and 226ra 73 however samples within the interquartile range q1 q3 were in the same order of magnitude indicating that outliers are the major source of high standard deviation fig 6 the differences in the decay rates of the radium isotopes 223ra 11 4 days 224ra 3 66 days and 226ra 1600 years allow the estimation of residence time or radium age see section 3 3 dulaiova and burnett 2008 moore 2000 swarzenski et al 2007 the use of 224ra is limited by its short residence time therefore 224ra pairs are inappropriate for sites with residence times longer than 20 days stewart et al 2015 as expected for sydney harbour cardno and baird 2015 das et al 2000 we calculated residence times using three isotopic pairs 224ra 223ra 223ra 226ra and 224ra 226ra by selecting the average the maximum and the minimum value in the endmembers table 2 the estimated residence times showed that sgd remains for no longer than 70 days in the harbour this is comparable to an average residence time of 100 days estimated with a hydrodynamic model cardno and baird 2015 however das et al 2000 found a maximum value of 225 days using a bi dimensional numerical model the residence times used in our sgd flux calculations were based on the maximum ratio of 223ra 226ra in the groundwater endmembers to provide a conservative sgd estimate the residence times varied mostly from upstream to downstream where radium concentrations and ratios were lower fig 7 if we use residence times estimated from cardno and baird 2015 and from das et al 2000 the sgd fluxes m3 d 1 would remain on the same order of magnitude and sgd rates would be reduced by 0 4 0 6 cm d 1 20 30 5 2 the magnitude of sgd fluxes sgd fluxes have been typically compared with riverine fluxes on a global scale radium derived saline sgd has been shown to exceed river inputs to the ocean kwon et al 2014 moore et al 2008 our radium derived estimated sgd fluxes in the sydney harbour were 78 104 m3 d 1 but may range from 42 103 to 121 103 m3 d 1 depending on assumptions in the radium mass balances these estimated fluxes are greater than the maximum historical riverine flux from the parramatta river in june of 1991 12 19 104 m3 d 1 www bom gov au at a large scale sgd fluxes are expected to be greater than river fluxes along continental margins kwon et al 2014 the small catchment surrounding sydney harbour 480 km2 delivers small river inputs making sgd relatively more important we highlight that while rivers deliver fresh water to the sydney harbour sgd is likely dominated by seawater circulation in intertidal sediments although we did not estimate fresh sgd fsgd it is likely that fsgd is negligible when compared to saline sgd using both radon and radium mass balances sadat noori et al 2015 found that fsgd was undetectable in an estuary located 500 km north from sydney our estimated sgd rates are about 60 fold greater than river derived freshwater inputs but we found no significant freshening of the harbour where radium hotspots were observed if fresh sgd was important lower salinities would be expected to occur near the radium hotspots which was not the case especially in the bottom of the lower harbour where a radium hot spot was observed fig 4 streams base flow which is comparable to the minimum river discharge is supplied by fresh groundwater chow 1965 meixner 2008 smakhtin 2001 assuming negligible inputs from sewage or irrigation capesius joseph 2012 consequently the parramatta river base flow is an indicator of the potential scale of fresh groundwater flows into the estuary the ephemeral nature of the streams in the region impplies that fresh groundwater flow is not enough to keep the water flowing through the year and that surface flows are mostly supplied by rainfall events nevertheless if we ignore no flow periods and assume that the base flow of the parramatta river is equal to the first quartile the base flow or fresh groundwater would be equal to 18 m3 d 1 which is four orders of magnitude lower than the minimum of our saline sgd estimates 43 27 104 m3 d 1 sgd fluxes are expected to change when measured at different spatial and temporal scales rodellas et al 2017 wilson 2005 our study considered two different scales the entire harbour scale in the order of tens of kilometres and the embayment scale in the scale of kilometres sgd rates cm d 1 were not related to scale implying that other factors such as lithology and ocean forces could be more important anwar et al 2014 fig 8 sgd rates for sydney harbour were higher near the ocean than in the upper harbour this could be related to the modified infiltration capacity of its soils due to urbanization and wall construction in the upper harbour hose et al 2005 and the occurrence of permeable sandy beaches towards the mouth the lower harbour sandy beaches are also more exposed to tides and waves potentially enhancing saline sgd robinson et al 2018 based upon our measurements it is not clear whether urbanization or proximity to the ocean is the main factor explaining the spatial variability of sgd at different temporal scales different isotopes can trace processes occurring around the half life of the isotope cerdà domènech et al 2017 rodellas et al 2017 in sydney harbour sgd fluxes estimated with 226ra 122 80 104 m3 d 1 were higher by a factor of 1 7 than sgd fluxes estimated with 223ra 70 48 104 m3 d 1 and about three times higher than sgd fluxes estimated with 224ra 43 27 104 m3 d 1 estimations made with 226ra allows for the differentiation of long term sgd fluxes shorter lived isotopes 224ra and 223ra are more responsive to short term processes such as wave and tidally driven sgd rodellas et al 2017 that occur at shallower and shorter groundwater flow paths wilson 2005 the slightly higher sgd fluxes estimated from 226ra could imply that sgd in sydney harbour may also include recirculation of seawater in the aquifer deeper flow paths with longer groundwater residence times bratton 2010 5 3 sgd derived nutrient fluxes we compared our estimated sgd derived nutrient fluxes to riverine fluxes into sydney harbour and to the broader literature we found that the inflow creeks and the parramatta river had comparable nutrient concentrations to the groundwater endmembers but that the creek river water discharge is lower than radium derived sgd flux by two orders of magnitude while the maximum riverine nutrient endmembers can be higher than the groundwater endmembers table 4 the average annual river water flow is 1 of total sgd making riverine inputs of nutrients minor compared to sgd during average conditions during storm conditions fresh water delivers high nutrient and carbon loads to sydney harbour that can remain in the estuary for about three weeks hose et al 2005 lee et al 2011 nutrients and carbon can settle down in the bottom sediments and be later transported to the water column via sgd tait et al 2014 the maximum riverine nutrient flux was calculated by multiplying the maximum nutrient concentration in the riverine endmember by the maximum registered river discharge even with this extreme assumption the average sgd derived nutrient fluxes still exceeded riverine nutrient fluxes by a factor of 2 for doc 6 for po4 3 40 for nh4 and 1 3 for nox table 4 birch et al 2010 used a storm water model to estimate the nutrients delivered through rivers into the sydney harbour they estimated a total annual load of 475 t of nitrogen and 40 t of dissolved phosphorus in comparison our maximum riverine fluxes would be 330 t y 1 of nitrogen nh4 nox and 5 2 t y 1 of po4 3 regardless our saline sgd fluxes for po4 3 were still greater than birch et al 2010 estimates and are equivalent to 33 8 t y 1 while nitrogen nh4 nox was still higher by a factor of 3 5 and equivalent to 1570 408 t y 1 to further explore the relation between sgd fluxes and nutrients we performed linear regression analysis this revealed significant positive correlations between 224ra and doc r2 0 52 and po4 3 r2 0 45 while significant negative correlations where found between 224ra and ammonium r2 0 78 and 224ra and nox r2 0 68 fig 9 positive correlations of groundwater tracers and doc have been observed in previous studies due to higher concentrations of doc in groundwater compared to surface waters stewart et al 2015 webb et al 2019 similar to our study stewart et al 2018 found negative correlations between radium isotopes and nitrogen species in a new zealand harbour contrary to our findings they found negative correlations between radium isotopes and po4 3 indicating that the relation of sgd with this nutrient can be site specific release of phosphorus in sediments through saline sgd may explain the positive correlations found in sydney harbour with residence times on scales of several weeks it is likely that sgd derived nutrient concentrations are modified by biological processes while radium isotopes are modified by physical processes only the stronger correlations observed between short lived isotopes 224ra and 223ra rather than then longer lived isotope 226ra indicate that processes occurring on time scales of hours to days e g tidal pumping can release more sediment nutrients than long term circulation processes longer residence times are expected to reduce nutrient delivery due to greater retention in the aquifer cerdà domènech et al 2017 rodellas et al 2017 santos et al 2012 slomp and van cappellen 2004 5 4 sgd in urban estuaries urbanization can play an important role modifying aquifers and estuaries hayashi et al 2009 sharp et al 2008 potentially altering sgd one of the most notable features of urbanization in sydney harbour is the large areas of reclaimed lands especially around the most upstream embayments table 1 suh et al 2004 geoscience australia www ga gov au around 1 3 107 m2 of coastal land surrounding the harbour results from landfills which is 35 of the harbour area less landfills are present towards the lower harbour fig 1 for example rose bay is characterised by marine sands and has the highest sgd rates fig 8 we suggest that combined effects of urbanization sediment type and distance to the ocean explain the greater sgd rates in the lower harbour even though it is not possible to separate their relative contribution with the data available it has been pointed previously that extensive urbanization is likely to increase nutrient fluxes to sydney harbour birch et al 2010 man made infilling may not only change sgd rates through modification of hydraulic conductivity but may also release buried pollutants to groundwater and eventually to surface waters of the harbour reclaimed land in homebush bay consists of about 9 mt of industrial waste including pollutants such as dioxins and heavy metals suh et al 2004 we found that sgd fluxes in that embayment are equal to 5000 2000 m3 d 1 or 0 4 0 1 cm d 1 hence sgd delivers significant amounts of doc 2931 1025 µmol m2 d 1 po4 3 17 6 µmol m2 d 1 and nox 2 0 8 µmol m2 d 1 but seems to be acting as a sink of nh4 9 3 µmol m2 d 1 in this embayment among all the embayments sgd derived doc fluxes were comparable from 292 to 2931 µmol m2 d 1 however nitrogen and phosphorus sgd fluxes were highest at rozelle bay po4 3 45 nh4 3 5 103 and nox 1 2 103 µmol m2 d 1 fig 8 isolating how urbanization is influencing sgd derived nutrient fluxes is challenging previous studies suggested that sewage and fertilizers are the major anthropogenic sources of sgd derived nitrogen and phosphorus slomp and van cappellen 2004 indicating that potential sewage leaks could drive the higher sgd nutrient fluxes at rozelle bay numerous studies have been carried out to estimate sgd in urban estuaries around the globe fig 10 the greatest number of studies were conducted in asia 37 followed by north america 25 for example sgd rates ranged from 4 10 4 cm d 1 in osaka japan taniguchi et al 2003 to 50 cm d 1 bangkok thailand burnett et al 2009 in these studies 54 used radium isotopes 16 radon 4 darcy s law based estimations and 20 seepage meters fig 10 different methods can quantify different sgd components for example radon and darcy s laws estimates often account for both fresh and saline sgd bratton 2010 wilson 2005 radium in turn is released from aquifer particles at high salinities making it primarily a tracer of sal ine sgd hatje et al 2017 therefore our estimates account for mostly saline sgd and include small scale processes from embayment scale to nearshore scale 10 m 10 km usually the distance where the saline plume can penetrate the aquifer arfib et al 2007 sharp et al 2008 infiltration rates in the sydney harbour has been reduced due to urbanization hose et al 2005 and large areas of natural soil have been replaced with infills fig 1 in order to put the total sgd rate in context we compared our estimations with a range of other large urban estuarine systems fig 10 for all the papers reviewed the average sgd rate in urban estuaries was 8 11 cm d 1 while sgd rates from radium based estimations were equal to 3 1 2 4 cm d 1 radium derived sgd remained relatively low compared to the other methods ranging from 0 014 to 8 cm d 1 while sgd rates derived from radon and seepage meters were on average 20 higher fig 10 this is to be expected as seepage meters and radon account for both fresh and saline sgd while radium tracers account primarily for saline the literature radium derived sgd average 3 1 2 4 cm d 1 is similar to our estimates for sydney harbour 2 2 1 5 cm d 1 indicating that urbanization effects on sgd can be comparable to other sites while sgd has been shown to be important in multiple urban systems the direct effects of urbanization still need further research 6 conclusions we used radium isotopes to assess sgd derived nutrient fluxes n p and c into sydney harbour the total sgd fluxes ranged from 42 104 to 121 104 m3 d 1 these fluxes are likely related to saline sgd recirculated seawater rather than fresh sgd and are equivalent to 60 times the mean annual river discharge into sydney harbour 0 68 104 m3 d 1 larger fluxes were estimated with long lived isotopes showing that long term processes contributes to higher sgd fluxes for sydney harbour urbanization and ocean forces seemed to be major sgd drivers for example sgd rates increased towards the ocean proximity to the ocean exposes the aquifer to tidal and wave actions enhancing saline sgd traced by radium the upper harbour embayments had a greater area of infills than the lower harbour fig 1 which could explain lower sgd rates the estimated sgd rates in sydney 2 2 1 5 cm d 1 were comparable to the global average of radium derived sgd in other urban estuaries 3 1 2 4 cm d 1 yearly sgd can deliver high nutrient and carbon loads to sydney harbour sgd derived nutrient fluxes exceeded maximum riverine nutrient fluxes by a factor of two for doc six for po4 3 40 for nh4 and 1 3 for nox although the major source of new nutrients is likely to be fresh riverine waters saline sgd plays an important role in the recycling and releasing of sediment nutrients to surface waters and may play a major role sustaining primary productivity in sydney harbour even in periods of no

6010,the effects of urbanization and scales on submarine groundwater discharge sgd remain poorly understood here we used radium isotopes to quantify sgd derived fluxes of nitrogen phosphorus and dissolved organic carbon doc into sydney harbour estuary australia sydney is the most populated city of oceania with several localised cases of historical groundwater pollution we sampled top and bottom waters at the harbour scale 20 km and also at four small scale embayments 2 km a decreasing gradient in radium isotope concentrations from upstream to downstream was observed mass balances constructed with 224ra 223ra and 226ra revealed that total sgd ranged from 42 to 121 104 m3 d 1 depending on assumptions and isotope these fluxes were related mostly to saline sgd recirculated seawater and are equivalent to 60 times the mean annual freshwater river discharge into sydney harbour 0 68 104 m3 d 1 the estimated sgd rates 2 2 1 5 cm d 1 were comparable to the global average radium derived sgd in other urban estuaries 3 1 cm d 1 no obvious relationships were observed between sgd and scale in sydney harbour however higher sgd rates estimated for embayments closer to the ocean indicate that a combination of waves tides and urbanization control sgd sgd derived fluxes exceeded maximum riverine nutrient fluxes by a factor of 2 for doc 6 for po4 3 40 for nh4 and 1 3 for nox previous work has suggested that nutrients enter sydney harbour primarily through rivers or stormwater following episodic rain events our results imply that diffuse saline sgd can also be an important but overlooked source of nutrients potentially sustaining primary productivity in times of no river flow keywords urban estuaries coastal aquifers subterranean estuary radium isotopes porewater 1 introduction accelerated urban development is significantly impacting marine ecosystems with the largest megacities in the globe located on the coast lee et al 2006 some of the most noticeable impacts are associated with increases in riverine inputs of nutrients and pollutants syvitski and kettner 2011 zhang et al 1999 nutrients can also be exported to the ocean via submarine groundwater discharge sgd on local crotwell and moore 2003 regional paiva and niencheski 2018 and global cho et al 2018 scales however sgd inputs have received far less attention in part because sgd is more difficult to quantify than riverine fluxes seepage meters piezometers natural geochemical traces water balances and numerical modelling have been used to estimate sgd burnett et al 2006 the development of isotopic radon and radium isotopes techniques in the 1990s burnett et al 2001 moore 1997 moore and arnold 1996 has led to an increase in sgd investigations in the coastal ocean and

river deltas peterson et al 2008 coral reefs mcmahon and santos 2017 lagoons santos et al 2008 estuaries moore et al 2006 and the continental shelf moore et al 2008 overall these studies highlight not

al 2018 burnett et al 2009 luo et al 2014 effective sgd assessments may require an understanding of governing processes at multiple scales bratton 2010 santos et al 2012 wilson 2005 three major scales has been assessed shelf 10 km embayment 10 km and nearshore 10 m scales bratton 2010 even though ocean basin scale sgd estimates are now available chen et al 2019 cho et al 2018 kwon et al 2014 moore et al 2008 rodellas et al 2015 at the shelf scale sgd is dominated by topographic driven flow from up to tens of kilometres inland wilson 2005 and typically consists of fresh water flow burnett et al 2006 the embayment scale sgd is driven by processes in the upper unconfined aquifer and the upper confined aquifer tides and sea level changes at the nearshore scale waves and tides play a relatively more important role in driving saline sgd fluxes nearshore scale processes often occur between the high tide line and the bottom of the upper confining layer of the coastal aquifer sgd off beaches often occurs via the filtration of large amounts of saline water in permeable sediments making this scale crucial from biogeochemical and water quality perspectives bratton 2010 accelerated global urbanization along coastal margins has the potential to impact sgd across all of these scales impacts of urbanization have been assessed for aquifers and estuaries with little data on how it may alter sgd and related nutrient fluxes major impacts of urbanization on coastal aquifers include 1 modification of aquifer recharge rates due to change in land cover and hydraulic connectivity hayashi et al 2009 sharp et al 2008 2 depletion of groundwater levels potentially leading to saltwater intrusion hayashi et al 2009 3 and changes in groundwater chemistry due to infiltration of pollutants sharp et al 2008 impacts on estuaries include direct impacts on the estuary chemistry and modification of hydrological and sediment transport regimes feely et al 2010 lee et al 2006 how sgd is affected by urbanization remains poorly understood in this study we hypothesise that sgd releases groundwater pollutants to surface waters in a heavily urbanized estuary sydney harbour australia we assessed the spatial variability of sgd and its associated nutrient fluxes by solving radium mass balances with map algebra three radium isotopes 223ra 224ra and 226ra were employed to quantify saline sgd over different spatial scales sgd derived nutrient fluxes were estimated for dissolved inorganic nitrogen din phosphorus dip and dissolved organic carbon doc our estimates were compared at two spatial scales harbour scale and embayments scale and to other major urban systems around the globe 2 study site this study was conducted in may 2018 in sydney harbour fig 1 by sampling waters from the parramatta river weir in western sydney 33 81309 151 0097 to the harbour mouth 33 8282 151 2781 28 km fig 1 we also performed higher resolution sampling in four small embayments homebush bay hen and chicken bay rozelle bay and rose bay to analyse the effects of spatial scales on sgd and identify potential hotspots related to different land uses table 1 our study is representative of dry conditions only 23 2 mm of rain falling in the month prior to sampling which is equivalent to 19 of the average rainfall for the month 117 mm and 2 of the mean annual average 1222 mm http www bom gov au sampling in dry conditions implies that our radium observations trace mostly saline rather than fresh sgd and prevent river inputs from confounding interpretations in the radium mass balance sydney harbour is a microtidal estuary that bisects sydney the most populated city in oceania 5 millions inhabitants the estuary has low fresh water inputs 6750 m3 d 1 on average that come mostly from episodic rainfall events lee et al 2011 the estuary catchment area is 500 km2 with 50 km2 of water surface area the surface area of fresh water channels within the catchment is only about 4 of the total estuary area tanner et al 2017 90 of the estuary catchment is urbanised which has reduced the infiltration capacity of its soils and increased surface runoff and storm water pollution hose et al 2005 homebush bay in the western end of the harbour is a heavily industrialised area with historical groundwater pollution largely due to the burial of domestic industrial and commercial waste approximately 9 mt of waste have been deposited in this embayment since early in the 20th century including heavy metals and agent orange suh et al 2004 hen and chicken bay is a relatively shallow embayment characterized by medium density residential surroundings rozelle bay s catchment contains sydney s main commercial and business district and its substrate has been highly modified with man made fills and retention walls along the shoreline table 1 finally rose bay near the mouth of the harbour is characterized by dense residential areas and sandy beaches fig 1 3 methods 3 1 sampling and analysis we collected 105 samples from 15th to 25th may 2018 on a catamaran type vessel within the harbour samples were collected from 20 locations along the main axis of the harbour fig 1 at each of these locations we collected top and bottom samples other 33 locations were sampled within selected embayments 33 top samples and five bottom samples when depths 2 m top samples were collected from within one meter of the surface and bottom samples were collected from one meter above the bottom sediments seven freshwater samples were collected to estimate radium desorption in four creeks and the parramatta river and 21 groundwater samples to estimate radium carbon and nutrient endmembers at each surface sampling station we measured salinity depth profiles using an ysi castaway ctd we sampled radium isotopes by filtering 100 l of surface water or 6 l of groundwater through 15 g of manganese mn fibers moore and reid 1973 in the laboratory mn fibers were rinsed with radium free water to remove salts and particles partially dried and analysed with a radium delayed coincidence counter radecc for 223ra and 224ra moore and arnold 1996 samples were then sealed for one month in gas tight cartridges allowing the ingrowth of 222rn from 226ra decay peterson et al 2008 and analysed again using a radecc for 226ra radium isotopes are released at high salinities making them ideal tracers of saline sgd hatje et al 2017 swarzenski et al 2007 boreholes n 21 were dug in the intertidal zone during low tide to collect groundwater samples bore depths were variable as we dug until the water table was reached usually between 0 5 and 2 m and then dug for another 0 5 m to collect the water that is most likely to exchange with the surface after digging we inserted a 3 pvc pipe with a polypropylene geotextile screen 0 5 m from the bottom we purged the well three times with a peristaltic pump ensuring the collection of new groundwater and allowing for suspended particles to settle to measure nutrients dissolved inorganic nitrogen din nh4 nox and dissolved inorganic phosphorus dip po4 2 we syringed 40 ml of sample through 0 45 µm cellulose acetate filters nucleopore into 10 ml plastic vials samples were frozen and taken to the laboratory for analysis using a lachat flow injection analyser with analytical uncertainties 5 for dissolved organic carbon doc 30 ml of water were filtered through 0 7 µm whatman gf f filters into acid and pre combusted 450 c for 4 h borosilicate vials containing 100 µl of saturated hgcl2 3 2 radium diffusion from sediments and desorption in order to estimate radium desorbed from fresh water we sampled four tributaries entering sydney harbour fig 1 first we passed 30 l of fresh water salinity 0 5ppt through 15 g of mn fibers at 1 l min salt was added to a second 30 l container until salinity exceeded 30 after three hours we filtered the salt infused water through mn fibers the difference of concentration between radium in salted samples and unsalted samples was assumed to be equivalent to desorption peterson et al 2008 radium contamination resulting from the addition of salt was assumed to be zero as it has been found to be undetectable in our previous similar experiments sadat noori et al 2018 stewart et al 2015 water discharge for the creeks was obtained from the water nsw service https realtimedata waternsw com au water stm to characterize diffusion from bottom sediments we collected eight sediment samples along the length of the harbour fig 1 we took 500 ml of each sediment sample and mixed it with 6 5 l of radium free seawater the sediment was incubated for 60 days to establish secular equilibrium between short lived radium isotope decay and the sediment source peterson et al 2008 the overlying water was then filtered through mn impregnated fibres and analysed using the radecc this method was only applied to 224ra and 223ra because 226ra has a very long half life 1600 yr stewart et al 2018 we assume that after 5 half lives radioactive decay only radium sink is equivalent to diffusion only radium source 3 3 radium ages radium ages were calculated based on the activity ratio ar of a short lived to a longer lived radium isotope moore 2000 the method relies on a constant initial ratio in the source ari gathered from the groundwater samples relative to a specific surface water sample arobs three possible ratios were used 224ra 223ra 223ra 226ra and 224ra 226ra for each of these ratios we estimated residence times using the average minimum and maximum groundwater ratio in order to quantify a potential range of radium ages radium ages t were then calculated using 1 t ln ar i ar obs x 1 λ short l i v e d λ long l i v e d where λ represents the decay constant of the ra isotope this approach relies on the assumption that 1 the major source of radium is groundwater and 2 the estimated apparent radium ages represents the time since the seawater sample was in contact with the source 3 4 sgd estimates to estimate sgd flux qgw m3 d 1 the harbour area was divided into pixels of 39 24 39 24 m and used map algebra to solve the following equations moore s 2006 approach was used to solve a radium mass balance fig 2 2 q gw 1 n ra n v n t 1 n ra n λ v n q riv ra riv ra des ra dif ra gw where n is any interpolated pixel ra n is the concentration of ra at any n pixel dpm m 3 vn is the volume of the water column at that pixel m3 t is the average residence time of the harbour days d λ d 1 is the decay constant of ra qriv is the river discharge m3 d 1 ra riv is the ra at the river dpm m 3 ra des is the desorbed ra ra dif is the diffusion in the whole harbour dpm m 3 and ra gw is the average ra concentration of the endmembers from groundwater to minimize potential uncertainties associated with spatial distribution we generated maps of radium concentration by applying ordinary kriging wackernagel 2003 the mass balance was then integrated for each area of interest the whole sydney harbour and the four embayments we estimated sgd fluxes in units of m3 d 1 and sgd rates in units of cm d 1 often referred as specific sgd using the area of each system table 1 we estimated sgd derived nutrient fluxes as has been done elsewhere charette and buesseler 2004 cho et al 2018 hwang et al 2016 lee et al 2008 qu et al 2017 using 3 potential n u t r i e n t f l u x q gw nutrient gw where q gw is the derived sgd flux estimated in the mass balance equation eq 3 and nutrient gw is the groundwater endmembers µmol l 1 the nutrient gw term was defined as the difference between the average groundwater concentration and the average surface water concentration because saline sgd or seawater recirculation in beach sediments dominates total sgd see below this approach to quantify the nutrient endmember resolves the net nutrient fluxes resulting from saline sgd and prevents us from overestimating sgd derived nutrient and carbon fluxes to the ocean santos et al 2014 uncertainties in the estimations of sgd and associated nutrient and carbon fluxes were calculated by using the harvard 2007 method for error propagation 4 results 4 1 ancillary data temperature within the surface waters of the harbour varied between 14 9 and 18 5 c with the highest temperatures closest to the estuary mouth salinity ranged from 25 6 to 35 6 with the lowest salinities observed in the upper harbour near the parramatta river relatively uniform salinity and temperature vertical profiles indicated no significant stratification during the sampling fig 3 the mean annual river discharge of parramatta river haslam creek white creek and johnstone creek combined was 7700 m3 d 1 4 2 radium isotopes a decreasing gradient in radium isotope concentrations was observed towards the mouth of the harbour fig 4 the upper harbour homebush bay and hen and chicken bay had the highest concentrations of 223ra at 4 2 dpm 100 l with a maximum of 6 1 dmp 100 l while rozelle bay and rose bay concentrations were about half the upper harbour a minimum concentration of 223ra 0 1 dmp 100 l was observed close to the ocean no vertical stratification was observed for 223ra similar spatial trends were observed for 224ra and 226ra however vertical stratification of both isotopes was apparent in the upper harbour with higher concentrations in bottom waters than in the surface 224ra concentrations ranged between 0 3 and 126 dpm 100 l while 226ra concentrations ranged between 8 3 and 15 9 dpm 100 l fig 6 in groundwater samples the average 223ra and 224ra concentration was 12 times higher than surface waters concentrations while the average 226ra concentration was approximately four times higher average riverine 223ra and 224ra concentrations were about seven times lower than brackish saline harbour surface waters while average 226ra concentrations were comparable average diffusion fluxes of radium from sediments n 8 was 1 7 0 5 dpm m2 d 1 for 223ra and 80 25 dpmm 2d 1 for 224ra we assume that 226ra diffusion was 0 42 dpm m2 d 1 based on global average estimates liu et al 2014 4 3 nutrients and doc high concentrations of doc 160 µmol l were localized in four areas the upper harbour hen and chicken bay rose bay and the bottom waters of the lower harbour fig 5 hen and chicken bay and rose bay are residential areas indicating potential input of domestic wastewaters or leakage of underground waste pipelines an area of high po4 3 concentrations was seen in the upper harbour between homebush bay and hen and chicken 0 5 1 0 µmol l similar to doc a second hotspot of po4 3 was observed in bottom waters of the lower harbour fig 5 nh4 concentrations ranged from 2 1 to 4 5 µmol l while nox ranged between 0 2 and 0 7 µmol l and were both lowest in rose bay contrary to doc and po4 3 nh4 and nox were lowest in the bottom waters of the lower harbour fig 5 all groundwater samples had higher concentrations of nutrients and doc than surface waters fig 6 doc had average concentrations of 263 175 µmol l po4 3 had an average concentration of 1 7 2 2 µmol l and nh4 and nox had average concentrations of 37 127 and 19 47 µmol l respectively fig 6 fresh riverine samples had low concentrations of po4 3 0 5 0 5 µmol l and nh4 2 3 3 5 µmol l when compared to saline surface waters but relatively high concentrations of doc and nox 510 88 and 46 31 µmol l fig 6 4 4 radium ages mass balance and nutrient fluxes calculating residence times was necessary to estimate the export of radium to the ocean and build a radium mass balance fig 2 we estimated apparent residence times by using three different isotope ratio combinations 224ra 223ra 223ra 226ra and 224ra 226ra table 2 by using the minimum groundwater ratios radium ages were estimated to range from 1 3 to 3 4 days which is unrealistic compared to previous studies das et al 2000 the most conservative residence times were obtained by using the maximum ratio in groundwater samples between 223ra 226ra with an average of 36 7 days and a maximum of 70 days fig 7 by using 223ra 226ra the net export of radium for the whole harbour was estimated to be 576 357 106 dpm d 1 we directly estimated diffusion by incubating sediments samples in the laboratory the measured diffusion from each embayment was a negligible source of 226ra undetected minimum source of 223ra 62 35 106 dpm d 1 and moderate source of 224ra 5966 3878 106 dpm d 1 after subtracting all the sources of radium diffusion from sediments decay and riverine input from the export of radium to the ocean the remaining radium flux was attributed to sgd fig 2 sgd fluxes ranged between 42 and 121 104 m3 d 1 with an average rate of 2 2 1 5 cm d 1 table 3 for all the embayments the largest fluxes were estimated using 226ra while the smallest with 224ra average sgd fluxes m3 d 1 were comparable between embayments hen and chicken bay rozelle bay and rose bay had fluxes in the same order of magnitude 1 7 and 4 9 104 m3 d 1 homebush bay had the lowest fluxes at 0 5 0 2 104 m3 d 1 sgd rates cm d 1 increased towards the ocean where sediments are sandier and tides and waves had more influence homebush bay had the lowest sgd rates at 0 4 0 1 cm d 1 while rose bay had the highest at 2 5 1 7 cm d 1 table 2 fig 8 the estimated nutrient fluxes indicate sgd delivered between 124 and 203 103 mol d 1 of doc between 0 7 103 and 1 2 103 mol d 1 of po4 3 from 26 103 to 44 103 mol d 1 of nh4 and from 8 103 to 14 103 mol d 1 of nox table 4 this corresponds to 5 1 t y 1 of doc 33 9 t y 1 of dip and 1570 408 t y 1 of din dividing these fluxes by the area of the harbour sgd nutrient fluxes were estimated at 4 1 103 µmol m2 d 1 of doc 27 7 µmol m2 d 1 of po4 3 963 250 µmol m2 d 1 of nh4 and 315 82 µmol m2 d 1 of nox within embayments doc ranged between 292 and 2931 µmol m2 d 1 while for the rest of the nutrients rozelle bay had the highest flux rates po4 3 45 nh4 3 5 103 and nox 1 2 103 µmol m2 d 1 fig 8 negative sgd fluxes of nh4 were observed in homebush bay 9 3 and rose bay 15 6 indicating that sgd was possibly acting as a sink by consuming nitrogen during seawater circulation in beach sediments 5 discussion 5 1 uncertainties in sgd estimates natural tracer derived estimates of sgd are often subject to inherent uncertainties unresolved temporal and spatial variability unquantified sources of radium endmember natural variability and residence times are among the most common sources of uncertainty knee and paytan 2011 santos et al 2009 here we discuss how we approached these uncertainties to offer a potential range in sgd estimates rather than an absolute value previous studies have estimated sgd by using temporal cerdà domènech et al 2017 jeffrey et al 2016 and spatial observations stewart et al 2015 and some have relied on both adyasari et al 2018 sadat noori et al 2015 our spatial approach allowed for a comparison among different embayments with sgd rates representative of processes occurring within the isotope half life or system s residence time to develop mass balances estuaries can be divided in volumetric units simplifying its geometry for example sadat noori et al 2015 estimated sgd fluxes by dividing an estuary with a homogeneous channel geometry in four boxes resulting in estimated sgd uncertainties of only 23 estuaries with complex geometry and circulation patterns are more challenging in order to deal with this in sydney harbour we solved the mass balance equation pixel by pixel within the harbour and its embayments this approach gave us confidence when estimating the radium inventories in the system ignoring different sources of radium also leads to uncertainty in the estimation of sgd stewart et al 2015 we analysed radium inputs from fresh water creeks and radium diffused directly from the sediments in the bottom of the harbour combined these sources accounted for an average of 10 9 of radium sources highlighting that sgd was the major source of the three radium isotopes sydney harbour receives most of its fresh water during storms lee et al 2011 using the average annual freshwater input and radium concentrations observed during our survey dissolved and desorbed radium inputs would account for 0 1 of radium sources by assuming the maximum river discharge registered for the parramatta river 121 973 m3 d 1 riverine radium inputs would account for a maximum of 2 5 of estimated 226ra losses therefore any uncertainties in river inputs or desorption play only a minor role in final sgd estimates the sewage input into the harbour was assumed to be an negligible source of radium as sydney releases treated sewage offshore and radium concentrations in sewage have been reported to be minimal in previous studies in the us beck et al 2007 the major source of uncertainty in the estimation of saline sgd is usually related to the groundwater endmember moore and arnold 1996 sadat noori et al 2018 santos et al 2009 concentration of natural tracers in groundwater have previously been reported to have a large spatial variability peterson et al 2008 schmidt et al 2010 however increasing sample size reduces uncertainties for example a previous study found that at least 12 groundwater samples may be enough to stabilize standard errors sadat noori et al 2015 we collected 21 groundwater samples spatially distributed along the harbour and embayments with high standard deviation 223ra 30 224ra 23 and 226ra 73 however samples within the interquartile range q1 q3 were in the same order of magnitude indicating that outliers are the major source of high standard deviation fig 6 the differences in the decay rates of the radium isotopes 223ra 11 4 days 224ra 3 66 days and 226ra 1600 years allow the estimation of residence time or radium age see section 3 3 dulaiova and burnett 2008 moore 2000 swarzenski et al 2007 the use of 224ra is limited by its short residence time therefore 224ra pairs are inappropriate for sites with residence times longer than 20 days stewart et al 2015 as expected for sydney harbour cardno and baird 2015 das et al 2000 we calculated residence times using three isotopic pairs 224ra 223ra 223ra 226ra and 224ra 226ra by selecting the average the maximum and the minimum value in the endmembers table 2 the estimated residence times showed that sgd remains for no longer than 70 days in the harbour this is comparable to an average residence time of 100 days estimated with a hydrodynamic model cardno and baird 2015 however das et al 2000 found a maximum value of 225 days using a bi dimensional numerical model the residence times used in our sgd flux calculations were based on the maximum ratio of 223ra 226ra in the groundwater endmembers to provide a conservative sgd estimate the residence times varied mostly from upstream to downstream where radium concentrations and ratios were lower fig 7 if we use residence times estimated from cardno and baird 2015 and from das et al 2000 the sgd fluxes m3 d 1 would remain on the same order of magnitude and sgd rates would be reduced by 0 4 0 6 cm d 1 20 30 5 2 the magnitude of sgd fluxes sgd fluxes have been typically compared with riverine fluxes on a global scale radium derived saline sgd has been shown to exceed river inputs to the ocean kwon et al 2014 moore et al 2008 our radium derived estimated sgd fluxes in the sydney harbour were 78 104 m3 d 1 but may range from 42 103 to 121 103 m3 d 1 depending on assumptions in the radium mass balances these estimated fluxes are greater than the maximum historical riverine flux from the parramatta river in june of 1991 12 19 104 m3 d 1 www bom gov au at a large scale sgd fluxes are expected to be greater than river fluxes along continental margins kwon et al 2014 the small catchment surrounding sydney harbour 480 km2 delivers small river inputs making sgd relatively more important we highlight that while rivers deliver fresh water to the sydney harbour sgd is likely dominated by seawater circulation in intertidal sediments although we did not estimate fresh sgd fsgd it is likely that fsgd is negligible when compared to saline sgd using both radon and radium mass balances sadat noori et al 2015 found that fsgd was undetectable in an estuary located 500 km north from sydney our estimated sgd rates are about 60 fold greater than river derived freshwater inputs but we found no significant freshening of the harbour where radium hotspots were observed if fresh sgd was important lower salinities would be expected to occur near the radium hotspots which was not the case especially in the bottom of the lower harbour where a radium hot spot was observed fig 4 streams base flow which is comparable to the minimum river discharge is supplied by fresh groundwater chow 1965 meixner 2008 smakhtin 2001 assuming negligible inputs from sewage or irrigation capesius joseph 2012 consequently the parramatta river base flow is an indicator of the potential scale of fresh groundwater flows into the estuary the ephemeral nature of the streams in the region impplies that fresh groundwater flow is not enough to keep the water flowing through the year and that surface flows are mostly supplied by rainfall events nevertheless if we ignore no flow periods and assume that the base flow of the parramatta river is equal to the first quartile the base flow or fresh groundwater would be equal to 18 m3 d 1 which is four orders of magnitude lower than the minimum of our saline sgd estimates 43 27 104 m3 d 1 sgd fluxes are expected to change when measured at different spatial and temporal scales rodellas et al 2017 wilson 2005 our study considered two different scales the entire harbour scale in the order of tens of kilometres and the embayment scale in the scale of kilometres sgd rates cm d 1 were not related to scale implying that other factors such as lithology and ocean forces could be more important anwar et al 2014 fig 8 sgd rates for sydney harbour were higher near the ocean than in the upper harbour this could be related to the modified infiltration capacity of its soils due to urbanization and wall construction in the upper harbour hose et al 2005 and the occurrence of permeable sandy beaches towards the mouth the lower harbour sandy beaches are also more exposed to tides and waves potentially enhancing saline sgd robinson et al 2018 based upon our measurements it is not clear whether urbanization or proximity to the ocean is the main factor explaining the spatial variability of sgd at different temporal scales different isotopes can trace processes occurring around the half life of the isotope cerdà domènech et al 2017 rodellas et al 2017 in sydney harbour sgd fluxes estimated with 226ra 122 80 104 m3 d 1 were higher by a factor of 1 7 than sgd fluxes estimated with 223ra 70 48 104 m3 d 1 and about three times higher than sgd fluxes estimated with 224ra 43 27 104 m3 d 1 estimations made with 226ra allows for the differentiation of long term sgd fluxes shorter lived isotopes 224ra and 223ra are more responsive to short term processes such as wave and tidally driven sgd rodellas et al 2017 that occur at shallower and shorter groundwater flow paths wilson 2005 the slightly higher sgd fluxes estimated from 226ra could imply that sgd in sydney harbour may also include recirculation of seawater in the aquifer deeper flow paths with longer groundwater residence times bratton 2010 5 3 sgd derived nutrient fluxes we compared our estimated sgd derived nutrient fluxes to riverine fluxes into sydney harbour and to the broader literature we found that the inflow creeks and the parramatta river had comparable nutrient concentrations to the groundwater endmembers but that the creek river water discharge is lower than radium derived sgd flux by two orders of magnitude while the maximum riverine nutrient endmembers can be higher than the groundwater endmembers table 4 the average annual river water flow is 1 of total sgd making riverine inputs of nutrients minor compared to sgd during average conditions during storm conditions fresh water delivers high nutrient and carbon loads to sydney harbour that can remain in the estuary for about three weeks hose et al 2005 lee et al 2011 nutrients and carbon can settle down in the bottom sediments and be later transported to the water column via sgd tait et al 2014 the maximum riverine nutrient flux was calculated by multiplying the maximum nutrient concentration in the riverine endmember by the maximum registered river discharge even with this extreme assumption the average sgd derived nutrient fluxes still exceeded riverine nutrient fluxes by a factor of 2 for doc 6 for po4 3 40 for nh4 and 1 3 for nox table 4 birch et al 2010 used a storm water model to estimate the nutrients delivered through rivers into the sydney harbour they estimated a total annual load of 475 t of nitrogen and 40 t of dissolved phosphorus in comparison our maximum riverine fluxes would be 330 t y 1 of nitrogen nh4 nox and 5 2 t y 1 of po4 3 regardless our saline sgd fluxes for po4 3 were still greater than birch et al 2010 estimates and are equivalent to 33 8 t y 1 while nitrogen nh4 nox was still higher by a factor of 3 5 and equivalent to 1570 408 t y 1 to further explore the relation between sgd fluxes and nutrients we performed linear regression analysis this revealed significant positive correlations between 224ra and doc r2 0 52 and po4 3 r2 0 45 while significant negative correlations where found between 224ra and ammonium r2 0 78 and 224ra and nox r2 0 68 fig 9 positive correlations of groundwater tracers and doc have been observed in previous studies due to higher concentrations of doc in groundwater compared to surface waters stewart et al 2015 webb et al 2019 similar to our study stewart et al 2018 found negative correlations between radium isotopes and nitrogen species in a new zealand harbour contrary to our findings they found negative correlations between radium isotopes and po4 3 indicating that the relation of sgd with this nutrient can be site specific release of phosphorus in sediments through saline sgd may explain the positive correlations found in sydney harbour with residence times on scales of several weeks it is likely that sgd derived nutrient concentrations are modified by biological processes while radium isotopes are modified by physical processes only the stronger correlations observed between short lived isotopes 224ra and 223ra rather than then longer lived isotope 226ra indicate that processes occurring on time scales of hours to days e g tidal pumping can release more sediment nutrients than long term circulation processes longer residence times are expected to reduce nutrient delivery due to greater retention in the aquifer cerdà domènech et al 2017 rodellas et al 2017 santos et al 2012 slomp and van cappellen 2004 5 4 sgd in urban estuaries urbanization can play an important role modifying aquifers and estuaries hayashi et al 2009 sharp et al 2008 potentially altering sgd one of the most notable features of urbanization in sydney harbour is the large areas of reclaimed lands especially around the most upstream embayments table 1 suh et al 2004 geoscience australia www ga gov au around 1 3 107 m2 of coastal land surrounding the harbour results from landfills which is 35 of the harbour area less landfills are present towards the lower harbour fig 1 for example rose bay is characterised by marine sands and has the highest sgd rates fig 8 we suggest that combined effects of urbanization sediment type and distance to the ocean explain the greater sgd rates in the lower harbour even though it is not possible to separate their relative contribution with the data available it has been pointed previously that extensive urbanization is likely to increase nutrient fluxes to sydney harbour birch et al 2010 man made infilling may not only change sgd rates through modification of hydraulic conductivity but may also release buried pollutants to groundwater and eventually to surface waters of the harbour reclaimed land in homebush bay consists of about 9 mt of industrial waste including pollutants such as dioxins and heavy metals suh et al 2004 we found that sgd fluxes in that embayment are equal to 5000 2000 m3 d 1 or 0 4 0 1 cm d 1 hence sgd delivers significant amounts of doc 2931 1025 µmol m2 d 1 po4 3 17 6 µmol m2 d 1 and nox 2 0 8 µmol m2 d 1 but seems to be acting as a sink of nh4 9 3 µmol m2 d 1 in this embayment among all the embayments sgd derived doc fluxes were comparable from 292 to 2931 µmol m2 d 1 however nitrogen and phosphorus sgd fluxes were highest at rozelle bay po4 3 45 nh4 3 5 103 and nox 1 2 103 µmol m2 d 1 fig 8 isolating how urbanization is influencing sgd derived nutrient fluxes is challenging previous studies suggested that sewage and fertilizers are the major anthropogenic sources of sgd derived nitrogen and phosphorus slomp and van cappellen 2004 indicating that potential sewage leaks could drive the higher sgd nutrient fluxes at rozelle bay numerous studies have been carried out to estimate sgd in urban estuaries around the globe fig 10 the greatest number of studies were conducted in asia 37 followed by north america 25 for example sgd rates ranged from 4 10 4 cm d 1 in osaka japan taniguchi et al 2003 to 50 cm d 1 bangkok thailand burnett et al 2009 in these studies 54 used radium isotopes 16 radon 4 darcy s law based estimations and 20 seepage meters fig 10 different methods can quantify different sgd components for example radon and darcy s laws estimates often account for both fresh and saline sgd bratton 2010 wilson 2005 radium in turn is released from aquifer particles at high salinities making it primarily a tracer of sal ine sgd hatje et al 2017 therefore our estimates account for mostly saline sgd and include small scale processes from embayment scale to nearshore scale 10 m 10 km usually the distance where the saline plume can penetrate the aquifer arfib et al 2007 sharp et al 2008 infiltration rates in the sydney harbour has been reduced due to urbanization hose et al 2005 and large areas of natural soil have been replaced with infills fig 1 in order to put the total sgd rate in context we compared our estimations with a range of other large urban estuarine systems fig 10 for all the papers reviewed the average sgd rate in urban estuaries was 8 11 cm d 1 while sgd rates from radium based estimations were equal to 3 1 2 4 cm d 1 radium derived sgd remained relatively low compared to the other methods ranging from 0 014 to 8 cm d 1 while sgd rates derived from radon and seepage meters were on average 20 higher fig 10 this is to be expected as seepage meters and radon account for both fresh and saline sgd while radium tracers account primarily for saline the literature radium derived sgd average 3 1 2 4 cm d 1 is similar to our estimates for sydney harbour 2 2 1 5 cm d 1 indicating that urbanization effects on sgd can be comparable to other sites while sgd has been shown to be important in multiple urban systems the direct effects of urbanization still need further research 6 conclusions we used radium isotopes to assess sgd derived nutrient fluxes n p and c into sydney harbour the total sgd fluxes ranged from 42 104 to 121 104 m3 d 1 these fluxes are likely related to saline sgd recirculated seawater rather than fresh sgd and are equivalent to 60 times the mean annual river discharge into sydney harbour 0 68 104 m3 d 1 larger fluxes were estimated with long lived isotopes showing that long term processes contributes to higher sgd fluxes for sydney harbour urbanization and ocean forces seemed to be major sgd drivers for example sgd rates increased towards the ocean proximity to the ocean exposes the aquifer to tidal and wave actions enhancing saline sgd traced by radium the upper harbour embayments had a greater area of infills than the lower harbour fig 1 which could explain lower sgd rates the estimated sgd rates in sydney 2 2 1 5 cm d 1 were comparable to the global average of radium derived sgd in other urban estuaries 3 1 2 4 cm d 1 yearly sgd can deliver high nutrient and carbon loads to sydney harbour sgd derived nutrient fluxes exceeded maximum riverine nutrient fluxes by a factor of two for doc six for po4 3 40 for nh4 and 1 3 for nox although the major source of new nutrients is likely to be fresh riverine waters saline sgd plays an important role in the recycling and releasing of sediment nutrients to surface waters and may play a major role sustaining primary productivity in sydney harbour even in periods of no

projections by several general circulation models gcms are used change factor methodology is applied to downscale gcms outputs the framework is applied to the velenjak watershed located in the northeastern tehran iran results show that the optimization algorithm provides optimal solutions for lids design under different extreme climate scenarios by allocating an average of 0 23 of the watershed area 20 of the maximum potential area considered for lids implementation which results in a runoff volume reduction of up to 18 the results also indicate that the optimal design of lids

mujumdar 2015 ganguli and coulibaly 2017 in urban areas there is a concern that stormwater runoff may be affected by climate change on precipitation amounts intensities and frequencies fowler and hennessy 1995 pyke et al 2011 for instance discussed that stormwater runoff is sensitive to changes in land impervious cover followed by changes in precipitation because of climate change impacts in climate change studies precipitation is often the main variable affecting runoff and consequently extreme events darand and sohrabi 2018 identified drought and flood prone areas of iran by analyzing spatiotemporal changes in precipitation under climate change impacts switzman et al 2017 showed how rainfall intensity duration frequency curves could vary under different climate change models and scenarios with study sites in southern ontario canada the variations in rainfall could result in negative effects on urban drainage system and lead to more frequent and severer flooding events during the recent decades a projection of future changes in the rainfall runoff process has received considerable attention all over the world in order to cope with the uncertainties from a changing climate

putro et al 2016 investigated the impacts of climate and land use change on water quantity and quality for four catchments in england their results indicated no trend in annual rainfall but an upward trend in the runoff in the two urban catchments zuo et al 2016 investigated the impacts of land use and climate changes on water yields in the huangfuchuan river basin of the loess plateau in china by detecting temporal trends and abrupt changes in runoff their results indicated decreasing trends in annual runoff and precipitation the changes in urban stormwater runoff resulted from the climate change impacts may have considerable implications for designing stormwater and flood control measures for watershed management zahmatkesh et al 2014a once surface runoff exceeds the drainage system capacity stormwater management practices such as low impact development lid or green infrastructure are required to be employed implementing runoff management practices in response to climate change can reduce climate related risks adaptation measures are aimed as an integrated approach to address different aspects of watershed management andersson sköld et al 2015 lid techniques are adapted as climate mitigation measures which also decrease the adverse impacts of urban growth on stormwater to meet drainage performance standards permeable pavement green roofs bio retention cells vegetated swales and infiltration trench are among the widely used lid measures these techniques can be economically and environmentally efficient for runoff management in urban areas understanding of lids in the context of climate change adaptation can be helpful in informing stormwater management decisions to reduce the risk of harmful future impacts pyke et al 2011 gill et al 2007 pyke et al 2011 newcomer et al 2014 and zahmatkesh et al 2014a are among those to investigate how lids implementation is effective in moderating potential impacts of climate change on surface runoff in urban areas although lids have been mentioned and used as promising practices to control stormwater runoff volume and pollution in the urban areas experimental and modeling efforts are required to test lid characteristics and propose an adequate guideline for optimizing lid management baek et al 2015 in optimizing lids application objectives such as improving runoff quality as well as decreasing runoff volume and costs of the implementation of lids can be incorporated in the modeling effort to find the most desired lid management options for urban runoff management single and multi objective

lid practices under the potential impacts of climate change an urban watershed velenjak in tehran iran modeled with the storm water management model swmm for rainfall runoff simulation is selected as a real world case study to implement the proposed methodology moreover future hydrologic conditions under climate change impacts are projected using the general circulation models gcms downscaled by a change factor methodology lid controls are utilized to decrease urban runoff volume as a stormwater management method while minimizing the costs associated with the lids implementation optimization algorithms are formulated for optimal design of the lids under different rainfall scenarios the scenarios are defined to be the representatives of minimum maximum and average rainfall possible conditions for the watershed the focus of this research is on the changes to single storm events here 2 and 20 year return period intensities rather than climate change impacts on storms frequency and or duration the objectives of the study are to address two main questions i does the optimum solution for the historical rainfall scenario defined based on single storm events with return periods of 2 and 20 year successfully work for the possible future rainfall scenarios under climate change impacts and ii compared to one optimum solution corresponding to each rainfall scenario how efficient would it be to develop a multi event optimization approach which considers all rainfall scenarios at once the second question has been raised because given the uncertainty in climate change impacts it is assumed to be more practical to develop one unique solution lids type area and location which can meet the runoff management goals for different future rainfall scenarios the solutions for these two questions will finally be compared to find the most desirable solution for urban runoff management considering climate change impact 2 study area to implement the framework for urban runoff quantity management velenjak watershed in the northeast part of tehran iran is selected tehran the capital city of iran is located in 35 34 to 35 51 n and 51 06 to 51 38 e and has an area of 730 km2 fig 1 the population of tehran in the urban area is 8 8 million tehran has a semi arid climate with mountains to its north and central desert to the south it is mild in spring and autumn and cold in winter summers in tehran are long hot and dry with very light rain in average 10 mm month and low relative humidity more rainfall occurs from early winter 30 mm in december to mid spring 50 mm in march because of the population growth urban expansion and increase in the impervious areas the drainage system in tehran is not able to capture the total runoff volume produced from heavy rainfall events moreover groundwater level as one of the main sources of supplying water in tehran is dropping down one reason is the increase in impervious areas which prevents stormwater runoff to infiltrate and recharge the groundwater the region of focus in this study has 27 sub catchments with the total area of 19 77 km2 fig 1 sub catchments areas vary between 0 162 km2 and 1 745 km2 lower and upper values of impervious coefficients and slopes are 0 and 82 and 2 and 80 respectively land use in this region is classified into three categories undeveloped residential with low density population and residential with high density population topographic data along with length and roughness of channels are obtained from soltani 2009 in addition rainfall time series every 6 h from 1998 to 2015 are collected by shomal tehran synoptic station located at 35 48 n and 51 29 e and elevation of 1549 1 m red circle in fig 1 the duration of the design rainfall is 24 hour based on the technical reports on the study area discussing the design standards of the local drainage system mahab ghods consulting engineering company 2012 the rainfall values and distribution are provided later in the result section 3 methodology in this research an integrated framework is proposed for the simulation and management of urban runoff considering climate change impacts swmm is used for rainfall runoff modeling lid techniques are suggested to control runoff quantity an optimization routine is formulated for runoff management based on a defined objective function associated with the runoff quantity and implementation cost of lids this is accomplished through developing a model using the genetic algorithm ga linked with the swmm type location and area of lids are considered as the decision variables in the optimization model to investigate climate change impacts on the watershed runoff various gcms are selected a change factor methodology is used to downscale raw gcm projections to a finer grid resolution which will be useful for the future assessment of impacts of extreme events on urban runoff design for lids to mitigate adverse impacts of climate change on runoff quantity is then investigated the most appropriate management solution for future and historical conditions of the watershed are compared moreover an optimization model is formulated for optimal design of a unique solution for lids considering multiple rainfall scenarios flowchart of the proposed methodology is shown in fig 2 in the following sections details of the different steps of the methodology along with the applied tools and models are presented 3 1 data collection to build the methodology and apply it to a real world case study several data sets and different information are collected and used the data include observed historical rainfall and runoff topographic and hydrologic characteristics and lid controls initial information for the study watershed to incorporate the climate change assessment gcms products for all the provided models and scenarios are obtained from http www ipcc data org the raw and large scale products are downloaded for the historical simulation for a grid which contains the rain gauge station in this study the data of 14 gcms under the climate change scenarios a1 a1b and b2 are used the list of models and scenarios can be found in http www ipcc data org cgi bin ddc nav dataset ar4 gcm also future projected information of these models and scenarios are downloaded for the period of 2046 2065 considering data availability for the same grid as data of the historical simulations 3 2 rainfall runoff simulation model the swmm hydrologic model developed by the united states environmental protection agency usepa rossman 2015 is employed for the simulation of the rainfall runoff process swmm has been widely used for urban hydrologic modeling all around the world examples are kovács and clement 2009 karamouz and nazif 2013 zahmatkesh et al 2014a b ghodsi et al 2016a b and yang and chui 2018 it should be noted that the model for the study watershed is previously calibrated by soltani 2009 based on the sub catchments characteristics including total area impervious area width curve numbers channels length and roughness as well as observed historical rainfall and runoff the developed swmm is used for dynamic single event simulation of surface hydrology the one day design rainfall based on the historical time series of data is used as the model input within the model the hydrologic component receives rainfall and generates runoff the routing time steps is 30 s the hydraulic module then transports the generated runoff through channels to the watershed outfall the quantity of flow in the watershed outlet is tracked and recorded for further analysis 3 3 urban runoff management lid controls are designed based on the characteristics of the sub catchments namely land use area slope and impervious area using the swmm combinations of lids can be included while hydrologic modeling is performed for the watershed to investigate lids effect on runoff quantity several types of lids including permeable pavement prpv bio retention cell brc vegetative swale ves and infiltration trench intr are considered prpvs are hard layers filled with gravel and paved with porous concrete they allow rainfall to penetrate in the underneath base they have benefits for reducing surface streamflow quantity and pollutant loading dietz 2007 jia et al 2015 brcs are depressed layers of vegetation soil mixture with a gravel bed they are able to provide storage infiltration and evaporation of rainfall and surface runoff brcs are designed to remove dissolved pollutants and particulates from the surface stormwater vess are networks of canals with sloping sides enclosed by vegetation they slow down the movement of runoff and allow it to percolate the soil beneath the ground intrs are ditches filled with gravel they capture streamflow and provide capacity and time for it to infiltrate the soil the characteristics of lids have been taken from swmm user manual rossman 2015 and mahab ghods consulting engineering company 2012 which are presented in table a1 see supplement section to effectively integrate the abovementioned lids in the watershed runoff management the sub catchments with high runoff volume and impervious area are identified as the potential locations for lids implementation for this purpose an index is calculated for each sub catchment by multiplying the total runoff volume to the corresponding impervious coefficient 3 4 climate change impact modeling understanding of climate impacts on stormwater runoff can be derived from monitoring the changes in rainfall projection of gcms these models have around 100 250 km horizontal resolution several approaches have been demonstrated to scale projected values for higher spatial resolution and reduce the biases between gcm and local projected time series here the change factor methodology cfm is used due to its previous successful applications simplicity and its computationally economical value in comparison to other downscaling methods this method has been widely used by researchers and applied in different climate change impact assessment studies on water supply and availability conway and hulme 1996 karamouz et al 2014 goharian et al 2015

1997 reynard et al 2001 prudhomme et al 2002 zahmatkesh et al 2014a b here after downscaling the raw gcms precipitation products the scenarios which represent the extreme cases i e wet and dry as well as normal conditions are identified then these scenarios are used to obtain design rainfall for the future conditions of the watershed under climate change impacts list of the climate models and scenarios considered to identify extreme cases is provided in table 1 3 4 1 rainfall downscaling cfm incorporates information of local observed rainfall to provide direct scaling of the gcms change factors or scaling values should be first calculated based on the differences or ratios of the historical and future projections of gcms then cfm develops additive or multiplicative relationships to scale the historical local observations to the future rainfall projections the historical local observations and gcm projections for the baseline period should be equal in length to the corresponding future time period change factors are different in terms of their temporal resolution domain scales and also the mathematical formations how to better select an appropriate time period temporal domain scale number of change factors and type of change factors may vary depending on the meteorological characteristics and purpose of the study more information in this regard can be found in anandhi et al 2011 in this study 12 monthly multiplicative change factors are used to scale the historically observed rainfall time series to the future possible rainfall projections these change factors are calculated as follows 1 c f i m p i m f u t p i m h i s 2 l p i t f u t c f i m l p i t o b s where cfi m is the monthly change factor for each gcm model and specific scenario i and month m pi m fut and pi m his are the future and baseline values of precipitation for each time increment m and model i lpi m fut and lpi m obs are local scaled future value and the corresponding local historical observed value of rainfall for the t th time step 3 4 2 rainfall scenarios based on climate change projections in order to find the extreme rainfall conditions from the future projections of gcms a method developed by karamouz et al 2014 is used based on this method the projections of different gcms and their respective change factors are calculated for each model under different climate change scenarios in order to select the minimum maximum and average models min p max p and mean p the following equation is used 3 m d c f j s e l m i n f o r j 1 2 n i 1 12 c f i m f c f i where jsel stands for the model projection in which its change factors have the minimum difference with the selected function mdcf f is the function that considers the selection of desired scenarios which is minimum maximum or average for min p max p or mean p respectively the corresponding rainfall scenarios hereafter will be referred as min p max p and mean p this metric determines the total difference between the cfs of the selected gcm with the extreme cfs based on the desired function f in addition three other scenarios are defined which represent the mean max and min precipitation scenarios using absolute mean max and min cfi m these scenarios are synthetic scenarios and do not represent any gcm projection they are generated in this study to represent extreme cases the corresponding rainfall scenarios hereafter will be referred as a min p a max p and a mean p identifying extreme scenarios using the change factors results in the representation of the possible range of future runoff variation under climate change impacts 3 5 optimizing lids design determining the most suitable type area and location of lids is the main concern related to using lids for urban runoff management in response to this concern in this study a single objective optimization model optimization algorithm i is formulated using ga to find the optimal possible solution for the decision variables according to the type of constraints and the objective function total runoff volume in the outfall is preferred to be minimized this leads to mitigate the dimensions of channels and construction costs in addition the implementation cost of lids is favored to be minimized these two aims are combined to build the single objective function f x optimization algorithm i 4 m i n i m i z e f x w 1 o b j 1 w 2 o b j 2 o b j 1 v x v min v max v min o b j 2 c x c min c max c min subject to l o w e r b o u n d i x i u p p e r b o u n d i w 1 w 2 1 where c x is the cost for the implementation of lids v x is the runoff volume v max v min c max and c min are the maximum and minimum values of runoff volume and cost respectively o b j 1 and o b j 2 are functions defined to standardize minimizing the runoff volume and cost of lid s implementation the value of the objective function f x as well as o b j 1 and o b j 2 is bounded between 0 and 1 x represents area and location of lids as the decision variables in addition w 1 and w 2 in eq 4 are the coefficients representing the relative importance of the objective function components namely runoff quantity and cost respectively w 1 w 2 1 constraints of the optimization model are the minimum and maximum values of the lids areas in each sub catchment which are defined based on the sub catchments characteristics i in the constraint is a counter to represent the decision variables finally the developed optimization model is driven by defining the population size total generation number crossover and mutation parameters as well as the constraints furthermore a second optimization model referred to as optimization algorithm ii is formulated for optimal design of lids considering multiple possible rainfall events all at once optimization algorithm ii 5 minimize s 1 s 14 g x w 1 obj s 1 w 2 obj s 2 where s represents the rainfall scenario and g x is the objective function obj s 1 and obj s 2 are the values of o b j 1 and o b j 2 as defined in eq 4 corresponding to scenario s the algorithm will minimize the summation of the g x for all defined rainfall scenarios and result in the optimal solution for lids areas and locations 4 results 4 1 design rainfall in order to estimate the design storms frequency analysis is performed on the historical annual maximum series of rainfall 24 hour rainfalls with return periods of 2 year and 20 year cumulative values of 36 6 mm and 54 mm respectively are selected for the analysis the duration of the design storm as well as the 2 and 20 year return periods are adopted from the technical reports on the study area discussing the design standards of the local drainage system mahab ghods consulting engineering company 2012 for defining the rainfall distribution the rainfall hyetograph of the study area is used ghodsi et al 2016a the distribution of the design rainfalls with the two return periods 2 year and 20 year is shown in fig 3 hyetographs of the corresponding design storms are used as the swmm input representing the baseline scenario without considering climate change impacts 4 2 potential sub catchments for lids implementation to identify potential sub catchments for lids implementation an index columns 4 and 8 in table 2 is calculated by multiplying the total runoff volume in each sub catchment to the corresponding impervious coefficient to obtain the total runoff in each sub catchment the simulation model is driven by the design rainfall with return period of 2 year refer to fig 3 without the use of lids the produced runoff in the 27 sub catchments of the study area is shown in table 2 land use and impervious area are the main factors contributing to the runoff for the sub catchments for more details see ghodsi et al 2016a the first 11 sub catchments located in undeveloped areas are completely pervious and do not contribute to runoff generation therefore the value of the index for these sub catchments is negligible based on the results the value of the index for sub catchments 12 13 14 15 17 18 20 22 25 and 27 bolded in table 2 is significantly larger than the others thus they are selected as the potential sub catchments for the implementation of lids green shaded areas in fig 1 4 3 climate change projection frequency analysis is performed on the downscaled rainfall and consequently updated design rainfalls under climate change impacts are obtained table 3 presents the value of the design rainfalls based on historical and future data based on the monthly change factors calculated for the gcms the absolute as explained in the methodology section minimum average and maximum precipitation scenarios s2 s4 for 2 year design rainfall and s9 s11 for 20 year design rainfall are formed this table shows that mrcgcm b1 hadcm3 a1b and gfcm21 b1 climate models project the minimum average and maximum possible rainfall in future scenarios s5 s7 and s12 s14 the baseline design rainfall scenarios s1 and s8 are also shown in table 3 which correspond to the bau business as usual state when climate change impacts are not incorporated in the analysis the gfcm21 b1 projects about 35 increase in 2 year design rainfall in the future compared with the historical rainfall comparing s7 with s1 while under the same model and scenario the 20 year design rainfall can be increased by almost twice 68 comparing s14 with s8 it should be noted the absolute scenarios are not the real representations of gcm projections they are formed based on the combinations of gcms and expected to project extreme conditions in each month the interesting point is that the combination of gcms which represents the absolute averaged condition in this study scenario s3 shows only about 1 change compared to the historical observed 2 year design rainfall scenario s1 it indicates that although the gcm projections are diverse the average change of their projections suggests a really small difference with the historical rainfall the most moderate model with projection close to historical condition is the hadcm3 a1b this model projects about 3 mm increase 8 in 2 year design rainfall in terms of the 20 year design rainfall the mrcgcm b1 suggests about 9 decrease in the design rainfall for future i e 33 4 mm for the 20 year design rainfall all future climate scenarios except a min p projects an increase in the rainfall in conclusion the analysis shows that based on the mean p model there is a tendency in the gcm projections for an increase in the 2 year and 20 year design rainfalls for the study area according to table 3 an increase of 1 to 68 could be expected for future design rainfall under climate change impacts for this region 4 4 optimizing lids implementation in the watershed 4 4 1 optimization model genetic algorithm considering the 10 potential sub catchments i e sub catchments 12 13 14 15 17 18 20 22 25 27 as explained in section 4 2 and four different types of lids i e ves brc prpv and intr 40 decision variables are identified for the optimization model which represent the type location and area of lids in different sub catchments the definition of the decision variables and the constraints for the optimization models are provided in ghodsi et al 2016b as a brief explanation decision variables x1 x2 x3 and x4 represents ves brc prpv and intr respectively which are related to sub catchment 12 similarly x5 x6 x7 and x8 correspond to sub catchment 13 it goes in a way that all potential sub catchments presented in table 2 would be covered therefore the last four variables i e x37 x38 x39 and x40 are related to sub catchment 27 the lower bound of the decision variables is set to zero the upper bounds are determined based on the sub catchments land use and area the unit implementation cost for lids are obtained from fallahi zarandi 2013 and ghodsi et al 2016a 5 77 14 46 7 65 and 11 07 dollar m2 for implementing vegetative swale ves bio retention cell brc permeable pavement prpv and infiltration trench intr respectively for calculating the maximum and minimum values of runoff volume and cost to be used in the objective function the developed swmm model is driven for all values of the design rainfall considering two conditions i without lids implementation ii with the maximum possible area of lids in the target sub catchments the minimum cost is zero and the maximum cost is obtained 1 796 555 the minimum and maximum values of runoff volume for the rainfall scenarios are presented in table 4 the minimum volume is expected when the maximum possible lid areas are implemented while the maximum runoff volume will obtain when no lid is used in the sub catchments in addition equal values of weights to minimize runoff volume and implementation cost of lids are considered in this analysis however to expand the current study effect of uncertainty in these weights on the optimization results could be investigated 4 4 2 lids optimal design following estimating the maximum and minimum runoff volume and cost for lids implementation the optimization model is solved for design rainfall scenarios an interface in matlab is developed in which the optimization algorithm is linked with the swmm hydrologic model the model is driven with design rainfall as input while the algorithm automatically changes the values of the decision variables to optimize the objective function in this process the swmm model is driven for more than 100 000 realizations the optimization model is driven for 14 different rainfall scenarios the computational time is 20 h approximately with a desktop computer 32 0 gb ram cpu e5 268w v4 3 00 ghz variation of the objective function value for the rainfall scenarios is shown in fig 4 the figure shows that the difference in the objective function values corresponding to different rainfall scenarios is not significant the maximum difference is observed between scenarios s2 and s13 as 0 022 it means that by changing the amount of precipitation the optimization model finds the optimal solution so that although the cost and volume of runoff are obtained different the values of the objective function are still very close the corresponding runoff volume lid implementation cost and runoff volume reduction rate designed for different rainfall scenarios based on the simulation optimization process are shown in fig 5 for each scenario the percentage of the volume reduction is calculated by dividing the runoff volume after the optimized implementation of lids to the maximum runoff volume when no lid is used as expected the total volume of runoff is increasing by the increase in the amount of the rainfall this increase follows a linear trend fig 5a in contrast by increasing the value of rainfall the runoff volume reduction rate decreases with a sharper slope for scenarios of less rainfall value to slighter slope for scenarios of more rainfall fig 5c more details for the lids type and area from the simulation optimization results are provided in table 5 for scenario s1 without incorporation of climate change impacts to update the design rainfall intensity by implementation of lids on only an area of 0 23 of the total area of the watershed 0 45 of the 10 potential sub catchments areas or 20 8 of the maximum possible area of lid implementation with a budget of 697000 the runoff volume could be decreased by 14 there is also a small difference for the implemented lids area among the rainfall scenarios which is because of the definition of objective function and the range of the area lower and upper bound that could be assigned to each lid in any sub catchment the optimization algorithm allocated less than one percent of the area of the sub catchments to lids implementation which corresponds to almost 20 of the maximum area available for using lids these findings are of great importance indicating how effective is dedicating a small fraction of the watershed area to cost effective lid practices for stormwater management and further potential flooding reduction the last row of table 5 shows the average percentage of lid types obtained from the optimization model for different scenarios insight into the results of the lids optimal design considering different scenarios shows that the use of bio retention cells is significantly more than the other types of lids the reason that the model tends to choose bio retention cells is the low cost of implementation as well as the ability of runoff volume reduction per unit area for this lid technique so far the optimization algorithm has been used for obtaining the optimal design of the lids in the watershed for different rainfall scenarios taking into account climate change impacts i e different designs for different scenarios each rainfall scenario represents a possible future state of the watershed nevertheless the probability of occurrence of each scenario under climate change is unknown this brings up the issue of which optimal design i e lids area and location should be implemented to ensure meeting the modeling objectives and stormwater management goals in the future in response to this issue the following questions are raised and investigated i does the optimal design based on the analysis of historical rainfall rainfall scenarios s1 and s8 work well for future rainfall scenarios defined under climate change impacts single event optimization approach ii compared to the optimum solution based on a single historical rainfall scenario how efficient would it be to develop a multi event optimization approach which considers the possible future rainfall scenarios at once 4 4 3 single event optimization approach to answer the first question the simulation model is driven considering a fixed design of lids for the sub catchments for all defined rainfall scenarios this design corresponds to the optimum design lids area and location obtained from the optimization model for the watershed which is obtained based on the current status of rainfall scenarios s1 and s8 which correspond to 2 year and 20 year historical design rainfalls respectively and are hereafter referred to as design i and design ii the resultant values of the objective function for each scenario are shown in fig 6 this figure also indicates the value of the objective function optimal solution i from the optimum designs by solving the optimization model individually for each scenario as shown in fig 4 as expected the figure shows that the values of the objective function from the optimum solutions are less than those assuming the historical rainfall design i and design ii for future the percentage of decrease increase in the runoff volume and lids implementation cost considering lids constructed based on design i and design ii to the optimal design of lids from solving the optimization model for each scenario is shown in fig 7 as observed in this figure for design i and design ii the maximum increase in runoff volume is 0 33 and 0 44 and in the cost of lids implementation is 2 68 and 1 84 respectively it means that if design i is utilized the maximum expected change in the runoff volume for the possible rainfall scenario in the future could be only 0 33 percent of the optimal solution i the best solution for each rainfall scenario these differences in the results for the objectives of the optimization model are negligible therefore it can be concluded that for this watershed designing lids by optimizing the objective function considering the analysis obtained from the historical rainfall scenarios s1 and s8 provides successful results satisfying the possible changes arising from modified rainfall in future due to climate change this also highlights the adequacy of the developed simulation optimization model for optimal design of lids to be used for a range of future possible rainfalls taking into account climate change impacts 4 4 4 multi event optimization approach in response to the second research question exploring that compared to the optimum solution based on a single historical rainfall scenario how efficient would it be to develop a multi event optimization approach which considers the possible future rainfall scenarios at once optimization algorithm ii defined by eq 5 is used in this model the summation of obj1 and obj2 for different rainfall scenarios is minimized the resultant optimal area and location of the lids are shown in fig 8 the cost of lids implementation for this optimum solution is 712 000 fig 8 shows that the tendency for using bio retention cells is more than other lids it also indicates that the area of bio retention cells is close to their maximum values in all sub catchments this is attributed to the bio retention cell s cost and design parameters defined in the swmm model as well as the objective function and constraints defined in the optimization model back to fig 6 the figure also shows how application of multi event optimization model optimization algorithm ii results in finding a unique optimum solution which satisfies multiple scenarios for different possible rainfall events value of the objective function from multi event optimization model yellow line in fig 6 is more than those corresponding to the optimal solutions optimal solution i and less than those from design i and design ii related to scenarios 1 and 8 as shown in fig 6 it is worth mentioning that solving the multi event optimization model is computationally extensive 12 day runtime although this model proposes a unique solution better than the solutions from design i and design ii for all possible future rainfall scenarios it still needs a long run time from 20 hours to 12 days in addition fig 7 further indicates the variations in lids design runoff volume and implementation cost when design i and design ii as well as the design from the multi event optimization model are used for all scenarios in comparison to the optimal designs obtained earlier optimal solution i for each scenario implementing the unique design from the multi event optimization model instead of optimal design individually for each scenario results in less runoff volume and allocating more budget to build the lids however these changes are not significant maximum change in the runoff volume and implementation cost of lids from the solution of multi event optimization model with those obtained by solving optimization algorithm i individually for each scenario optimal solution i is 0 33 and 4 94 which is negligible this further justifies the fact that driving the model optimization algorithm ii is time intensive although this time could be decreased using desktops of high speed configuration in addition the solution form the multi event model suggests more lids with more implementation cost and more runoff volume reduction in comparison with the solutions from design i and design ii results show that the proposed multi event optimization algorithm can successfully provide a unique solution which satisfies a combination of different rainfall scenarios considering extreme conditions expected from climate change 5 conclusion this study investigated an optimal design of lid practices for urban runoff management considering climate change impacts a framework was developed for simulation of a watershed in a hydrologic model and then optimization of lids design to reduce the runoff volume while minimizing the cost of lids implementation both single event and multi event optimization algorithms were formulated using genetic algorithm for optimal design of the lids this study showed that designing lids considering the baseline scenarios obtained from frequency analysis of the historical rainfall could acceptably result in meeting the watershed management goals and expectations in a future subjected to climate change impacts the results also indicated that the developed multi event optimization algorithm is capable of providing a unique optimal solution satisfying the objective functions for multiple climate scenarios all at once this model provides a unique solution that integrates a variety of extreme climate conditions expected for the watershed from climate change impacts the results showed that even if no change in rainfall is expected because of climate change lids play an important role in runoff reduction i e about 14 runoff volume reduction by implementing the lids in less than 1 of the watershed area while still functioning properly if rainfall intensity increases due to climate change impacts it should be mentioned that although recent climate projections from cmip5 coupled model inter comparison project phase 5 are available through the ipcc since the corresponding outputs are not downscaled for the study area while the cmip3 downscaled data were already available from another research by the authors this study benefits from the downscaled projections of cimp3 however the climate scenarios min max and absolute minimum and maximum are defined to be representative of possible extreme changes in the watershed still it is recommended to use cmip5 downscaled information to update expand this work when the data is available for the study area this study does not address the impact of changes in extreme events durations or frequency but rather the impacts on single storm events moreover although there is no clear answer to the probability of occurrence of climate change scenarios in future absolute minimum and maximum climate change scenarios are incorporated in the analysis to address the uncertainty associated with climate change impacts therefore the optimal solutions designed in this study address a future expected from the considered climate change models and scenarios declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

6011,urban drainage systems are generally designed based on the analysis of historical hydrologic variables especially rainfall hydrologic analysis however has been shown to be affected by climate change in response to the modified pattern of rainfall stormwater management practices such as low impact developments lids need to be applied to successfully respond to the possible future climatic conditions while meeting the performance criteria based on the current state of the watershed in this study a simulation optimization framework is proposed to find the optimal design of lids type location and area under climate change storm water management model swmm is utilized to simulate the rainfall runoff process this model is linked with a single objective optimization routine formulated by genetic algorithm ga that minimizes runoff volume and the costs associated with the lids design to investigate how climate change might affect the future watershed runoff rainfall projections by several general circulation models gcms are used change factor methodology is applied to downscale gcms outputs the framework is applied to the velenjak watershed located in the northeastern tehran iran results show that the optimization algorithm provides optimal solutions for lids design under different extreme climate scenarios by allocating an average of 0 23 of the watershed area 20 of the maximum potential area considered for lids implementation which results in a runoff volume reduction of up to 18 the results also indicate that the optimal design of lids based on the current condition satisfies the watershed management goals and expectations in a future subjected to climate change impacts moreover the results signify that the formulated multi event

hennessy 1995 pyke et al 2011 for instance discussed that stormwater runoff is sensitive to changes in land impervious cover followed by changes in precipitation because of climate change impacts in climate change studies precipitation is often the main variable affecting runoff and consequently extreme events darand and sohrabi 2018 identified drought and flood prone areas of iran by analyzing spatiotemporal changes in precipitation under climate change impacts switzman et al 2017 showed how rainfall intensity duration frequency curves could vary under different climate change models and scenarios with study sites in southern ontario canada the variations in rainfall could result in negative effects on urban drainage system and lead to more frequent and severer flooding events during

climate mitigation measures which also decrease the adverse impacts of urban growth on stormwater to meet drainage performance standards permeable pavement green roofs bio retention cells vegetated swales and infiltration trench are among the widely used lid measures these techniques can be economically and environmentally efficient for runoff management in urban areas understanding of lids in

newcomer et al 2014 and zahmatkesh et al 2014a are among those to investigate how lids implementation is effective in moderating potential impacts of climate change on surface runoff in urban areas although lids have been mentioned and used as promising practices to control stormwater runoff volume and pollution in the urban areas experimental and modeling efforts are required to test lid

a real world case study to implement the proposed methodology moreover future hydrologic conditions under climate change impacts are projected using the general circulation models gcms downscaled by a change factor methodology lid controls are utilized to decrease urban runoff volume as a stormwater management method while minimizing the costs associated with the lids implementation optimization algorithms are formulated for optimal design of the lids under different rainfall scenarios the scenarios are defined to be the representatives of minimum maximum and average rainfall possible conditions for the watershed the focus of this research is on the changes to single storm events here 2 and 20 year return period intensities rather than climate change impacts on storms frequency and or duration the objectives of the study are to address two main questions i does the optimum solution for the historical rainfall scenario defined based on single storm events with return periods of 2 and 20 year successfully work for the possible future rainfall scenarios under climate change impacts and ii compared to one optimum solution corresponding to each rainfall scenario how efficient would it be to develop a multi event optimization approach which considers all rainfall scenarios at once the second question has been raised because given the uncertainty in climate change impacts it is assumed to be more practical to develop one unique solution lids type area and location which can meet the runoff management goals for different future rainfall scenarios the solutions for these two questions will finally be compared to find the most desirable solution for urban runoff management considering climate change impact 2 study area to implement the framework for urban runoff quantity management velenjak watershed in the northeast part of tehran iran is selected tehran the capital city of iran is located in 35 34 to 35 51 n and 51 06 to 51 38 e and has an area of 730 km2 fig 1 the population of tehran in the urban area is 8 8 million tehran has a semi arid climate with mountains to its north and central desert to the south it is mild in spring and autumn and cold in winter summers in tehran are long hot and dry with very light rain in average 10 mm month and low relative humidity more rainfall occurs from early winter 30 mm in december to mid spring 50 mm in march because of the population growth urban expansion and increase in the impervious areas the drainage system in tehran is not able to capture the total runoff volume produced from heavy rainfall events moreover groundwater level as one of the main sources of supplying water in tehran is dropping down one reason is the increase in impervious areas which prevents stormwater runoff to infiltrate and recharge the groundwater the region of focus in this study has 27 sub catchments with the total area of 19 77 km2 fig 1 sub catchments areas vary between 0 162 km2 and 1 745 km2 lower and upper

residential with high density population topographic data along with length and roughness of channels are obtained from soltani 2009 in addition rainfall time series every 6 h from 1998 to 2015 are collected by shomal tehran synoptic station located at 35 48 n and 51 29 e and elevation of 1549 1 m red circle in fig 1 the duration of the design rainfall is 24 hour based on the technical reports

section 3 methodology in this research an integrated framework is proposed for the simulation and management of urban runoff considering climate change impacts swmm is used for rainfall runoff modeling lid techniques are suggested to control runoff quantity an optimization routine is formulated for runoff management based on a defined objective function associated with the runoff quantity and implementation cost of lids this is accomplished through developing a model using the genetic algorithm ga linked with the swmm type location and area of lids are considered as the decision variables in the optimization model to investigate climate change impacts on the watershed runoff various gcms are selected a change factor methodology is used to downscale raw gcm projections to a finer grid resolution which will be useful for the future assessment of impacts of extreme events on urban runoff design for lids to mitigate adverse impacts of climate change on runoff quantity is then investigated the most appropriate management solution for future and historical conditions of the watershed are compared moreover an optimization model is formulated for optimal design of a unique solution for lids considering multiple rainfall scenarios flowchart of the proposed methodology is shown in fig 2 in the following sections details of the different steps of the methodology along with the applied tools and models are presented 3 1 data collection to build the methodology and apply it to a real world case study several data sets and different information are collected and used the data include observed historical rainfall and runoff topographic and hydrologic characteristics and lid controls initial information for the study watershed to incorporate the climate change

2014a b ghodsi et al 2016a b and yang and chui 2018 it should be noted that the model for the study watershed is previously calibrated by soltani 2009 based on the sub catchments characteristics including total area impervious area width curve numbers channels length and roughness as well as observed historical rainfall and runoff the developed swmm is used for dynamic single event simulation of surface hydrology the one day design rainfall based on the historical time series of data is used as the model input within the model the hydrologic component receives rainfall and generates runoff the routing time steps is 30 s the hydraulic module then transports the generated runoff through channels to the watershed outfall the quantity of flow in the watershed outlet is tracked and recorded for further analysis 3 3 urban runoff management lid controls are designed based on the characteristics of the sub catchments namely land use area slope and impervious area using the swmm combinations of lids can be included while hydrologic modeling is performed for the watershed to investigate lids effect on runoff quantity several types of lids including permeable pavement prpv bio retention cell brc vegetative swale ves and infiltration trench intr are considered prpvs are hard layers filled with gravel and paved with porous concrete they allow rainfall to penetrate in the underneath base they have benefits for reducing surface streamflow quantity and pollutant loading dietz 2007 jia et al 2015 brcs are depressed layers of vegetation soil mixture with a gravel bed they are able to provide storage infiltration and evaporation of rainfall and surface runoff brcs are designed to remove dissolved pollutants and particulates from the surface stormwater vess are networks of canals with sloping sides enclosed by vegetation they slow down the movement of runoff and allow it to percolate the soil beneath the ground intrs are ditches filled with gravel they capture streamflow and provide capacity and time for it to infiltrate the soil the characteristics of lids have been taken from swmm user manual rossman 2015 and mahab ghods consulting engineering company 2012 which are presented in table a1 see supplement section to effectively integrate the abovementioned lids in the watershed runoff management the sub catchments with high runoff volume and impervious area are identified as the potential locations for lids implementation for this purpose an index is calculated for each sub catchment by multiplying the total runoff volume to the corresponding impervious coefficient 3 4 climate change impact modeling understanding of climate impacts on stormwater runoff can be derived from monitoring the changes in rainfall projection of gcms these models have around 100 250 km horizontal resolution several approaches have been demonstrated to scale projected values for higher spatial resolution and reduce the biases between gcm and local projected time series here the change factor methodology cfm is used due to its previous successful applications simplicity and its computationally economical value in comparison to other downscaling methods this method has been widely used by researchers and applied in different climate change impact assessment studies on water supply and availability conway and hulme 1996 karamouz et al 2014 goharian et al 2015 ecology buckley et al 2015 climate variability and hydropower generation mehta et al 2011 hydrological applications arnell and reynard 1996 seidel et al 1998 and flood analysis panagoulia and dimou 1997 reynard et al 2001 prudhomme et al 2002 zahmatkesh et al 2014a b here after downscaling the raw gcms precipitation products the scenarios which represent the extreme cases i e wet and dry as well as normal conditions are identified then these scenarios are used to obtain design rainfall for the future conditions of the watershed under climate change impacts list of the climate models and scenarios considered to identify extreme cases is provided in table 1 3 4 1 rainfall downscaling cfm incorporates information of local observed rainfall to provide direct scaling of the gcms change factors or scaling values should be first calculated based on the differences or ratios of the historical and future projections of gcms then cfm develops additive or multiplicative relationships to scale the historical local observations to the future rainfall projections the historical local observations and gcm projections for the baseline period should be equal in length to the corresponding future time period change factors are different in terms of their temporal resolution domain scales and also the mathematical formations how to better select an appropriate time period temporal domain scale number of change factors and type of change factors may vary depending on the meteorological characteristics and purpose of the study more information in this regard can be found in anandhi et al 2011 in this study 12 monthly multiplicative change factors are used to scale the historically observed rainfall time series to the future possible rainfall projections these change factors are calculated as follows 1 c f i m p i m f u t p i m h i s 2 l p i t f u t c f i m l p i t o b s where cfi m is the monthly change factor for each gcm model and specific scenario i and month m pi m fut and pi m his are the future and baseline values of precipitation for each time increment m and model i lpi m fut and lpi m obs are local scaled future value and the corresponding local historical observed value of rainfall for the t th time step 3 4 2 rainfall scenarios based on climate change projections in order to find the extreme rainfall conditions from the future projections of gcms a method developed by karamouz et al 2014 is used based on this method the projections of different gcms and their respective change factors are calculated for each model under different climate change scenarios in order to select the minimum maximum and average models min p max p and mean p the following equation is used 3 m d c f j s e l m i n f o r j 1 2 n i 1 12 c f i m f c f i where jsel stands for the model projection in which its change factors have the minimum difference with the selected function mdcf f is the function that considers the selection of desired scenarios which is minimum maximum or average for min p max p or mean p respectively the corresponding rainfall scenarios hereafter will be referred as min p max p and mean p this metric determines the total difference between the cfs of the selected gcm with the extreme cfs based on the desired function f in addition three other scenarios are defined which represent the mean max and min precipitation scenarios using absolute mean max and min cfi m these scenarios are synthetic scenarios and do not represent any gcm projection they are generated in this study to represent extreme cases the corresponding rainfall scenarios hereafter will be referred as a min p a max p and a mean p identifying extreme scenarios using the change factors results in the representation of the possible range of future runoff variation under climate change impacts 3 5 optimizing lids design determining the most suitable type area and location of lids is the main concern related to using lids for urban runoff management in response to this concern in this study a single objective optimization model optimization algorithm i is formulated using ga to find the optimal possible solution for the decision variables according to the type of constraints and the objective function total runoff volume in the outfall is preferred to be minimized this leads to mitigate the dimensions of channels and construction costs in addition the implementation cost of lids is favored to be minimized these two aims are combined to build the single objective function f x optimization algorithm i 4 m i n i m i z e f x w 1 o b j 1 w 2 o b j 2 o b j 1 v x v min v max v min o b j 2 c x c min c max c min subject to l o w e r b o u n d i x i u p p e r b o u n d i w 1 w 2 1 where c x is the cost for the implementation of lids v x is the runoff volume v max v min c max and c min are the maximum and minimum values of runoff volume and cost respectively o b j 1 and o b j 2 are functions defined to standardize minimizing the runoff volume and cost of lid s implementation the value of the objective function f x as well as o b j 1 and o b j 2 is bounded between 0 and 1 x represents area and location of lids as the decision variables in addition w 1 and w 2 in eq 4 are the coefficients representing the relative importance of the objective function components namely runoff quantity and cost respectively w 1 w 2 1 constraints of the optimization model are the minimum and maximum values of the lids areas in each sub catchment which are defined based on the sub catchments characteristics i in the constraint is a counter to represent the decision variables finally the developed optimization model is driven by defining the population size total generation number crossover and mutation parameters as well as the constraints furthermore a second optimization model referred to as optimization algorithm ii is formulated for optimal design of lids considering multiple possible rainfall events all at once optimization algorithm ii 5 minimize s 1 s 14 g x w 1 obj s 1 w 2 obj s 2 where s represents the rainfall scenario and g x is the objective function obj s 1 and obj s 2 are the values of o b j 1 and o b j 2 as defined in eq 4 corresponding to scenario s the algorithm will minimize the summation of the g x for all defined rainfall scenarios and result in the optimal solution for lids areas and locations 4 results 4 1 design rainfall in order to estimate the design storms frequency analysis is performed on the historical annual maximum series of rainfall 24 hour rainfalls with return periods of 2 year and 20 year cumulative values of 36 6 mm and 54 mm respectively are selected for the analysis the duration of the design storm as well as the 2 and 20 year return periods are adopted from the technical reports on the study area discussing the design standards of the local drainage system mahab ghods consulting engineering company 2012 for defining the rainfall distribution the rainfall hyetograph of the study area is used ghodsi et al 2016a the distribution of the design rainfalls with the two return periods 2 year and 20 year is shown in fig 3 hyetographs of the corresponding design storms are used as the swmm input representing the baseline scenario without considering climate change impacts 4 2 potential sub catchments for lids implementation to identify potential sub catchments for lids implementation an index columns 4 and 8 in table 2 is calculated by multiplying the total runoff volume in each sub catchment to the corresponding impervious coefficient to obtain the total runoff in each sub catchment the simulation model is driven by the design rainfall with return period of 2 year refer to fig 3 without the use of lids the produced runoff in the 27 sub catchments of the study area is shown in table 2 land use and impervious area are the main factors contributing to the runoff for the sub catchments for more details see ghodsi et al 2016a the first 11 sub catchments located in undeveloped areas are completely pervious and do not contribute to runoff generation therefore the value of the index for these sub catchments is negligible based on the results the value of the index for sub catchments 12 13 14 15 17 18 20 22 25 and 27 bolded in table 2 is significantly larger than the others thus they are selected as the potential sub catchments for the implementation of lids green shaded areas in fig 1 4 3 climate change projection frequency analysis is performed on the downscaled rainfall and consequently updated design rainfalls under climate change impacts are obtained table 3 presents the value of the design rainfalls based on historical and future data based on the monthly change factors calculated for the gcms the absolute as explained in the methodology section minimum average and maximum precipitation scenarios s2 s4 for 2 year design rainfall and s9 s11 for 20 year design rainfall are formed this table shows that mrcgcm b1 hadcm3 a1b and gfcm21 b1 climate models project the minimum average and maximum possible rainfall in future scenarios s5 s7 and s12 s14 the baseline design rainfall scenarios s1 and s8 are also shown in table 3 which correspond to the bau business as usual state when climate change impacts are not incorporated in the analysis the gfcm21 b1 projects about 35 increase in 2 year design rainfall in the future compared with the historical rainfall comparing s7 with s1 while under the same model and scenario the 20 year design rainfall can be increased by almost twice 68 comparing s14 with s8 it should be noted the absolute scenarios are not the real representations of gcm projections they are formed based on the combinations of gcms and expected to project extreme conditions in each month the interesting point is that the combination of gcms which represents the absolute averaged condition in this study scenario s3 shows only about 1 change compared to the historical observed 2 year design rainfall scenario s1 it indicates that although the gcm projections are diverse the average change of their projections suggests a really small difference with the historical rainfall the most moderate model with projection close to historical condition is the hadcm3 a1b this model projects about 3 mm increase 8 in 2 year design rainfall in terms of the 20 year design rainfall the mrcgcm b1 suggests about 9 decrease in the design rainfall for future i e 33 4 mm for the 20 year design rainfall all future climate scenarios except a min p projects an increase in the rainfall in conclusion the analysis shows that based on the mean p model there is a tendency in the gcm projections for an increase in the 2 year and 20 year design rainfalls for the study area according to table 3 an increase of 1 to 68 could be expected for future design rainfall under climate change impacts for this region 4 4 optimizing lids implementation in the watershed 4 4 1 optimization model genetic algorithm considering the 10 potential sub catchments i e sub catchments 12 13 14 15 17 18 20 22 25 27 as explained in section 4 2 and four different types of lids i e ves brc prpv and intr 40 decision variables are identified for the optimization model which represent the type location and area of lids in different sub catchments the definition of the decision variables and the constraints for the optimization models are provided in ghodsi et al 2016b as a brief explanation decision variables x1 x2 x3 and x4 represents ves brc prpv and intr respectively which are related to sub catchment 12 similarly x5 x6 x7 and x8 correspond to sub catchment 13 it goes in a way that all potential sub catchments presented in table 2 would be covered therefore the last four variables i e x37 x38 x39 and x40 are related to sub catchment 27 the lower bound of the decision variables is set to zero the upper bounds are determined based on the sub catchments land use and area the unit implementation cost for lids are obtained from fallahi zarandi 2013 and ghodsi et al 2016a 5 77 14 46 7 65 and 11 07 dollar m2 for implementing vegetative swale ves bio retention cell brc permeable pavement prpv and infiltration trench intr respectively for calculating the maximum and minimum values of runoff volume and cost to be used in the objective function the developed swmm model is driven for all values of the design rainfall considering two conditions i without lids implementation ii with the maximum possible area of lids in the target sub catchments the minimum cost is zero and the maximum cost is obtained 1 796 555 the minimum and maximum values of runoff volume for the rainfall scenarios are presented in table 4 the minimum volume is expected when the maximum possible lid areas are implemented while the maximum runoff volume will obtain when no lid is used in the sub catchments in addition equal values of weights to minimize runoff volume and implementation cost of lids are considered in this analysis however to expand the current study effect of uncertainty in these weights on the optimization results could be investigated 4 4 2 lids optimal design following estimating the maximum and minimum runoff volume and cost for lids implementation the optimization model is solved for design rainfall scenarios an interface in matlab is developed in which the optimization algorithm is linked with the swmm hydrologic model the model is driven with design rainfall as input while the algorithm automatically changes the values of the decision variables to optimize the objective function in this process the swmm model is driven for more than 100 000 realizations the optimization model is driven for 14 different rainfall scenarios the computational time is 20 h approximately with a desktop computer 32 0 gb ram cpu e5 268w v4 3 00 ghz variation of the objective function value for the rainfall scenarios is shown in fig 4 the figure shows that the difference in the objective function values corresponding to different rainfall scenarios is not significant the maximum difference is observed between scenarios s2 and s13 as 0 022 it means that by changing the amount of precipitation the optimization model finds the optimal solution so that although the cost and volume of runoff are obtained different the values of the objective function are still very close the corresponding runoff volume lid implementation cost and runoff volume reduction rate designed for different rainfall scenarios based on the simulation optimization process are shown in fig 5 for each scenario the percentage of the volume reduction is calculated by dividing the runoff volume after the optimized implementation of lids to the maximum runoff volume when no lid is used as expected the total volume of runoff is increasing by the increase in the amount of the rainfall this increase follows a linear trend fig 5a in contrast by increasing the value of rainfall the runoff volume reduction rate decreases with a sharper slope for scenarios of less rainfall value to slighter slope for scenarios of more rainfall fig 5c more details for the lids type and area from the simulation optimization results are provided in table 5 for scenario s1 without incorporation of climate change impacts to update the design rainfall intensity by implementation of lids on only an area of 0 23 of the total area of the watershed 0 45 of the 10 potential sub catchments areas or 20 8 of the maximum possible area of lid implementation with a budget of 697000 the runoff volume could be decreased by 14 there is also a small difference for the implemented lids area among the rainfall scenarios which is because of the definition of objective function and the range of the area lower and upper bound that could be assigned to each lid in any sub catchment the optimization algorithm allocated less than one percent of the area of the sub catchments to lids implementation which corresponds to almost 20 of the maximum area available for using lids these findings are of great importance indicating how effective is dedicating a small fraction of the watershed area to cost effective lid practices for stormwater management and further potential flooding reduction the last row of table 5 shows the average percentage of lid types obtained from the optimization model for different scenarios insight into the results of the lids optimal design considering different scenarios shows that the use of bio retention cells is significantly more than the other types of lids the reason that the model tends to choose bio retention cells is the low cost of implementation as well as the ability of runoff volume reduction per unit area for this lid technique so far the optimization algorithm has been used for obtaining the optimal design of the lids in the watershed for different rainfall scenarios taking into account climate change impacts i e different designs for different scenarios each rainfall scenario represents a possible future state of the watershed nevertheless the probability of occurrence of each scenario under climate change is unknown this brings up the issue of which optimal design i e lids area and location should be implemented to ensure meeting the modeling objectives and stormwater management goals in the future in response to this issue the following questions are raised and investigated i does the optimal design based on the analysis of historical rainfall rainfall scenarios s1 and s8 work well for future rainfall scenarios defined under climate change impacts single event optimization approach ii compared to the optimum solution based on a single historical rainfall scenario how efficient would it be to develop a multi event optimization approach which considers the possible future rainfall scenarios at once 4 4 3 single event optimization approach to answer the first question the simulation model is driven considering a fixed design of lids for the sub catchments for all defined rainfall scenarios this design corresponds to the optimum design lids area and location obtained from the optimization model for the watershed which is obtained based on the current status of rainfall scenarios s1 and s8 which correspond to 2 year and 20 year historical design rainfalls respectively and are hereafter referred to as design i and design ii the resultant values of the objective function for each scenario are shown in fig 6 this figure also indicates the value of the objective function optimal solution i from the optimum designs by solving the optimization model individually for each scenario as shown in fig 4 as expected the figure shows that the values of the objective function from the optimum solutions are less than those assuming the historical rainfall design i and design ii for future the percentage of decrease increase in the runoff volume and lids implementation cost considering lids constructed based on design i and design ii to the optimal design of lids from solving the optimization model for each scenario is shown in fig 7 as observed in this figure for design i and design ii the maximum increase in runoff volume is 0 33 and 0 44 and in the cost of lids implementation is 2 68 and 1 84 respectively it means that if design i is utilized the maximum expected change in the runoff volume for the possible rainfall scenario in the future could be only 0 33 percent of the optimal solution i the best solution for each rainfall scenario these differences in the results for the objectives of the optimization model are negligible therefore it can be concluded that for this watershed designing lids by optimizing the objective function considering the analysis obtained from the historical rainfall scenarios s1 and s8 provides successful results satisfying the possible changes arising from modified rainfall in future due to climate change this also highlights the adequacy of the developed simulation optimization model for optimal design of lids to be used for a range of future possible rainfalls taking into account climate change impacts 4 4 4 multi event optimization approach in response to the second research question exploring that compared to the optimum solution based on a single historical rainfall scenario how efficient would it be to develop a multi event optimization approach which considers the possible future rainfall scenarios at once optimization algorithm ii defined by eq 5 is used in this model the summation of obj1 and obj2 for different rainfall scenarios is minimized the resultant optimal area and location of the lids are shown in fig 8 the cost of lids implementation for this optimum solution is 712 000 fig 8 shows that the tendency for using bio retention cells is more than other lids it also indicates that the area of bio retention cells is close to their maximum values in all sub catchments this is attributed to the bio retention cell s cost and design parameters defined in the swmm model as well as the objective function and constraints defined in the optimization model back to fig 6 the figure also shows how application of multi event optimization model optimization algorithm ii results in finding a unique optimum solution which satisfies multiple scenarios for different possible rainfall events value of the objective function from multi event optimization model yellow line in fig 6 is more than those corresponding to the optimal solutions optimal solution i and less than those from design i and design ii related to scenarios 1 and 8 as shown in fig 6 it is worth mentioning that solving the multi event optimization model is computationally extensive 12 day runtime although this model proposes a unique solution better than the solutions from design i and design ii for all possible future rainfall scenarios it still needs a long run time from 20 hours to 12 days in addition fig 7 further indicates the variations in lids design runoff volume and implementation cost when design i and design ii as well as the design from the multi event optimization model are used for all scenarios in comparison to the optimal designs obtained earlier optimal solution i for each scenario implementing the unique design from the multi event optimization model instead of optimal design individually for each scenario results in less runoff volume and allocating more budget to build the lids however these changes are not significant maximum change in the runoff volume and implementation cost of lids from the solution of multi event optimization model with those obtained by solving optimization algorithm i individually for each scenario optimal solution i is 0 33 and 4 94 which is negligible this further justifies the fact that driving the model optimization algorithm ii is time intensive although this time could be decreased using desktops of high speed configuration in addition the solution form the multi event model suggests more lids with more implementation cost and more runoff volume reduction in comparison with the solutions from design i and design ii results show that the proposed multi event optimization algorithm can successfully provide a unique solution which satisfies a combination of different rainfall scenarios considering extreme conditions expected from climate change 5 conclusion this study investigated an optimal design of lid practices for urban runoff management considering climate change impacts a framework was developed for simulation of a watershed in a hydrologic model and then optimization of lids design to reduce the runoff volume while minimizing the cost of lids implementation both single event and multi event optimization algorithms were formulated using genetic algorithm for optimal design of the lids this study showed that designing lids considering the baseline scenarios obtained from frequency analysis of the historical rainfall could acceptably result in meeting the watershed management goals and expectations in a future subjected to climate change impacts the results also indicated that the developed multi event optimization algorithm is capable of providing a unique optimal solution satisfying the objective functions for multiple climate scenarios all at once this model provides a unique solution that integrates a variety of extreme climate conditions expected for the watershed from climate change impacts the results showed that even if no change in rainfall is expected because of climate change lids play an important role in runoff reduction i e about 14 runoff volume reduction by implementing the lids in less than 1 of the watershed area while still functioning properly if rainfall intensity increases due to climate change impacts it should be mentioned that although recent climate projections from cmip5 coupled model inter comparison project phase 5 are available through the ipcc since the corresponding outputs are not downscaled for the study area while the cmip3 downscaled data were already available from another research by the authors this study benefits from the downscaled projections of cimp3 however the climate scenarios min max and absolute minimum and maximum are defined to be representative of possible extreme changes in the watershed still it is recommended to use cmip5 downscaled information to update expand this work when the data is available for the study area this study does not address the impact of changes in extreme events durations or frequency but rather the impacts on single storm events moreover although there is no clear answer to the probability of occurrence of climate change scenarios in future absolute minimum and maximum climate change scenarios are incorporated in the analysis to address the uncertainty associated with climate change impacts therefore the optimal solutions designed in this study address a future expected from the considered climate change models and scenarios declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

6012,fractured bedrock aquifers provide an important source of drinking water in many regions around the world in settings with low matrix porosity and a small number of highly transmissive features such as crystalline bedrock high groundwater velocities through connected fracture pathways can increase aquifer vulnerability to contamination multiple fracture network characterization techniques e g geological geophysical and hydraulic are available to better understand this vulnerability conceptualizations of fracture network connectivity may be examined through the use of numerical models recently data gathered during the installation of flute blank liners have been used to assess cross hole transmissivity and fracture interconnections modelling and interpreting this type of hydraulic test presents a challenge since the open borehole length decreases during a liner installation this study provides a method to simulate a flute liner installation using hydrogeosphere a finite element code capable of simulating 3d transient flow conditions in discrete fracture networks results from previously published studies are used to inform the initial model configuration from which the sensitivity to various inputs including fracture aperture are then assessed good correlation between simulated and observed hydraulic response profiles was obtained however modelled fracture apertures yield an estimated bulk borehole transmissivity of 1 3 10 3 m2 s which was found to exceed a previous estimate of 2 1 10 4 m2 s obtained from constant head injection testing this may suggest overestimation of fracture apertures in the presented approach nonetheless this study supports numerical modelling as a viable method to simulate borehole liner installations keywords flute liner installation cross hole transient hydraulic response analysis numerical modelling fracture connectivity crystalline bedrock 1 introduction fractured bedrock aquifers represent a significant portion of aquifer systems worldwide and have tremendous importance for water resource use however these systems can be exceedingly complex and may be particularly susceptible to contamination the fractures and

network can allow predictions to be made on contaminant flow paths and travel times thereby providing a framework for decision making with regards to remediation monitoring and site management parker

be used however these methods can have drawbacks for example pumping tests may be associated with significant fluid displacement problematic at contaminated sites pulse interference tests especially those involving isolated test sections can be time and resource demanding and flow meter testing may be afflicted by issues concerning representativeness flute liner installations keller et al 2014 represent a potential new method for cross hole hydraulic characterization persaud et al 2018 compared the response of multiple liner installations to infer location and connectivity of major fracture zones as well as estimate transmissivity between boreholes using a conventional type curve analysis see persaud et al 2018 for more details however this analysis relied on several general assumptions and was unable to account for the continuously changing length of the open borehole that occurs during a liner installation further issues with solution non uniqueness warrant the exploration of an alternative numerical approach for the analysis of borehole hydraulic response data measured during nearby liner installation using field data to constrain model inputs the primary objective of this study is to numerically simulate the hydraulic response to borehole liner installations as evidence of discrete fracture connections within a borehole network it is anticipated that this approach will be an improvement over existing methods by enabling a more realistic representation of changing open borehole length and allowing for the examination of multiple fracture network conceptualizations to

and 3 assess the relative sensitivity of hgs model inputs for these conditions 2 methods 2 1 site description field data used in this modelling investigation were collected at a queen s university research station near tamworth ontario canada fig 1 a the subsurface consists of fractured gneissic bedrock with minimal overburden 1 5 m and surface outcrops observed at the site persaud et al 2018 a series of eight boreholes were constructed in the bedrock with seven vertical holes kf2 3 4 5 6 7 and 9 and one angled borehole kf8 boreholes kf2 3 4 5 and 9 were percussion drilled 156 mm diameter while kf6 7 and 8 were drilled using hq triple tube 96 mm in diameter all boreholes are open over the depth of the bedrock except for kf5 which was completed as a multi level piezometer three monitoring intervals created through the insertion of slotted 51 mm pvc pipe were isolated in this borehole with sand separated by bentonite confining layers and are referred to as kf5 upper kf5 middle and kf5 lower extensive hydraulic characterization has previously been performed at the site constant head injection tests were conducted on all boreholes using a straddle packer system having a packer spacing ranging from approximately 2 0 2 5 m elmhirst and novakowski 2012 these tests were conducted in continuous succession to provide transmissivity profiles with depth borehole geophysics were also performed including logs for formation conductivity natural gamma full waveform sonic active line source temperature and acoustic televiewer the latter of which is most relevant to this particular study additional pulse interference tests and pumping tests were performed in kf 2 3 and 4 elmhirst and novakowski 2012 persaud et al 2018 further advanced the understanding of the fracture network at this site through a series of cross hole liner installation tests fig 2 that were used to indicate the location of probable fracture zones and estimate inter borehole transmissivity six liner installation tests were completed by persaud et al 2018 during which a total of 21 well pair combinations were examined for the purposes of this study the kf5 kf6 pair was selected for simulation six features were identified as probable flow paths between the kf5 kf6 well pair table 1 and fig 1 b the hydraulic response measured in kf5 observation well from liner installation in kf6 source well was considered in combination with borehole acoustic televiewer logs to target these potential preferential flow paths 2 2 numerical modelling approach hgs was used to simulate liner descent in kf6 assuming a fully saturated model domain the examined kf5 kf6 well pair represents the final two boreholes remaining open in the completed sequence of consecutive installations all others lined as a result the potentially confounding effect of additional open boreholes on site and associated fracture cross connection is removed for this modelling exercise fractures were positioned at elevations in the source hole kf6 proposed by persaud 2017 and persaud et al 2018 as shown in table 1 these fractures were numbered sequentially from 1 shallowest to 7 deepest since the borehole liner continued to descend after fracture 6 was sealed at 16 3 mbgs persaud 2017 persaud et al 2018 it is likely that additional fractures exist below this point that allow displacement of water into the subsurface but were not previously identified therefore a seventh fracture was added in the model at the bottom of the borehole 44 5 mbgs to accommodate this flow the presence of a deeper transmissive zone is supported by previously completed constant head injection testing in this borehole elmhirst and novakowski 2012 furthermore the kf6 acoustic televiewer log indicates a number of potentially transmissive features in the vicinity of this seventh fracture suggesting that its placement is not unrealistic for the purpose of this study fractures were assumed to be horizontal and to extend to the edge of the model domain grid shown in fig 3 this orthogonal system is an approximation of reality that was implemented to simplify the discretization an arbitrary vertical fracture was defined equidistant between the two wells to represent fracture intersection that would likely occur with the original angled fractures the effect of the aperture and position of this vertical fracture was investigated during simulations wells kf5 and kf6 were defined in the center of the domain these boreholes were explicitly simulated in hgs as fluid filled wells with radii representative of actual well design saturated flow along the axis of each well was described according to the hagen poiseuille formula therrien and sudicky 2000 with a common node approach used to couple the well and surrounding subsurface media the observation well kf5 is screened over three intervals i e three open segments defined in hgs kf5 lower 25 3 38 2 mbgs kf5 middle 15 5 20 2 mbgs and kf5 upper open 0 0 10 7 mbgs during the field experiment persaud 2017 persaud et al 2018 kf5 middle showed the strongest head response while kf5 upper showed a weaker response and kf5 lower showed almost no response consequently this study focuses on the kf5 middle response for which an observation node was defined at the center of the monitoring interval kf6 was defined as open along its entire length from 0 0 mbgs 45 0 mbgs and injection nodes were placed in the well at the intersection points of each fracture to represent the flow of displaced borehole water a constant head boundary condition of 49 0 m 1 0 mbgs was defined for the four vertical faces of the domain with 2000 m 2000 m 50 m extents this domain was bounded on the top and bottom by a free surface and no flow boundary condition respectively a simple pumping test case using an initial head of 49 0 m was developed to determine the coarsest grid discretization that could be used without significantly affecting results in order to minimize run times grid generation and discretization were completed within hgs for this test scenario all fractures were assigned an arbitrary aperture of 400 μm and specific storage of 0 0001 m 1 with a constant applied pumping rate i e nodal flux at each fracture kf5 was used as a test observation well assumed to be open along its entire length with pumping in kf6 discretization in the x and y direction around each well was adjusted independent of discretization in the z direction around fractures with minimum and maximum cell dimensions manipulated as well as the grading factor multiplicative until changes in hydraulic head response were within 0 5 a resulting mesh of 181 000 nodes was generated with nodal spacing of 0 1 500 0 m in the x and y direction and nodal spacing of 0 1 5 0 m in the z direction this discretization is comparable to that used in previous investigations for flow simulations e g levison and novakowski 2012 jaoude et al 2018 but it is likely that if this model were to be used for transport simulations further grid refinement would be required weatherill et al 2008 the mesh was further assessed for potential impact of boundary conditions the same pumping test scenario as discussed above was simulated using an enlarged grid 20 000 m 20 000 m 50 m identical drawdown profiles were obtained for both the 2000 m 2000 m 50 m and 20 000 m 20 000 m 50 m domains indicating negligible boundary condition effects and supporting use of the smaller domain finally to validate model performance a comparison was made between transmissivity estimated via the cubic law snow 1965 as shown in eq 1 and that estimated using an analytical solution hgs pumping test results were fit with the theis 1935 solution in which a homogeneous confined aquifer of infinite extent is assumed transmissivity estimated additively using the cubic law 2 6 10 4 m2 s was within 10 of the transmissivity estimated from the drawdown curve 3 0 10 4 m2 s it should be noted that during this exercise and throughout the remainder of the manuscript effective fracture transmissivity t f l2 t and equivalent hydraulic fracture aperture 2 b l are used interchangeably according to the relationship defined in eq 1 1 2 b 12 μ t f ρ g 1 3 where μ is the viscosity of water m lt ρ is the density of water m l3 g is the gravitational acceleration l t2 to partition flow amongst fractures for the examined liner installation it was assumed that the sum of the transmissivity of all fractures must equal the bulk borehole transmissivity similarly as a borehole liner descends the flow rate out of all fractures must sum to the total volume of water displaced into the fracture network through time this overall flow rate is partitioned amongst the fractures as a function of fracture aperture it was found that flow rate through a single fracture can be considered as a cubed aperture weighted flow rate eq 2 2 q i 2 b i 3 i 1 n 2 b i 3 q t where q i is the flow rate through fracture i l3 t 2 b i is the aperture of fracture i l q t is the total flow rate l3 t and n is the number of unsealed fractures so that i 1 n 2 b i 3 represents the sum of the cubed aperture of n unsealed fractures as the simulation progresses the number of unsealed fractures decreases and the ratio q i q t changes the velocity of the liner descent depends on the transmissivity of the remaining unsealed portion of the borehole therefore as the borehole liner velocity changes with time so does the total flow rate q t and the flow rate through each of the remaining unsealed fractures q i these time dependent fracture flow rates volumetric fluxes were calculated for each active fracture sealed inactive fractures were assigned a rate of 0 m3 s and assigned to an injection node placed at the intersection of kf6 and each fracture as shown in the conceptual model fig 4 the designation of active versus inactive fractures was based on field measurements of liner descent persaud 2017 for the kf5 kf6 borehole liner installation as the liner descends it reduces the effective length of the borehole consequently it was assumed that simulations involving variable source well length would best represent this phenomenon given that hgs requires a single well length for each simulation it was necessary to break the simulation down into seven separate sub simulations to approximate the variable well length fig 5 each sub simulation represents the liner descent between two fractures and each sub simulation uses a different length for the kf6 well the first sub simulation represents the descent of the liner from the water table to just below fracture 1 the second sub simulation represents the descent of the liner from just below fracture 1 to just below fracture 2 and so on to run the sub simulations in series the output head distribution for the first sub simulation was used as the initial head distribution for the second sub simulation this was repeated for all seven sub simulations hgs does not have a graphical user interface and the input files are written in text format multiple scripts microsoft excel vba python and batch files were used to generate hgs input files and folder structures pass output from simulations to proceeding simulations run the hgs executables and to combine all the resultant head files into a single output file this workflow is summarized in fig 6 this allowed for efficient testing of a wide range of input conditions after the results of the sub simulations were combined into a single output file the head time series was analyzed and compared to field observations it is acknowledged that by stopping and starting the model with a new initial condition a static head distribution at the start of each sub simulation is assumed when in reality the flow field continues to change due to previous conditions to examine this assumption a simple test case based on the pumping test scenario described above with variable flow rates in sequential sub simulations was compared to an analogous analytical solution theis 1935 for which superposition is automatically applied additive transmissivity estimated via the cubic law for the hgs test case 2 6 10 4 m2 s was found to differ by less than half an order of magnitude relative to the analytical solution 1 2 10 4 m2 s this error must be considered in the final estimate of transmissivity determined from the model 2 3 statistical assessment of the results two statistical measures were used to assess both the quality of the model and the sensitivity of the model to its inputs to assess model quality the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient was calculated for each simulation using eq 3 nash and sutcliffe 1970 3 e 1 t 1 t s sim t s obs t 2 t 1 t s obs t s obs 2 where e is the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient ssim is the simulated head change l and sobs is the observed head change l the simulated and observed values were compared at each model output time t and the nash sutcliffe value was calculated over the first 2000 s t the nash sutcliffe value is defined as having a range from to 1 with 1 representing a perfect fit between the simulations and the field observations the nash sutcliffe value has been widely used in past hydrogeological investigations to assess model outputs including groundwater hydraulic head in a quantitative manner e g chandio et al 2012 hong et al 2016 whittecar et al 2017 nguyen and dietrich 2018 in this study nash sutcliffe efficiency was used as a performance metric given the fine temporal resolution of observed head data used to fit the hgs model this time series allows for the calculation of a meaningful nash sutcliffe value to assess the sensitivity of model parameters relative sensitivity was calculated as described in eq 4 mccuen 1973 4 s r o a o r p a p r p r o r where s r is the relative sensitivity o a is the adjusted output the average head response in kf5 middle l o r is reference output the average head response in kf5 middle for the baseline case l p a is the adjusted parameter e g average horizontal aperture l p r is the reference parameter e g average horizontal aperture for the baseline case l similar to the nash sutcliffe value relative sensitivity was calculated for the average change in kf5 middle head over first 2000 s of the simulation a value close to 0 represents low parameter sensitivity i e the parameter can be adjusted without significantly affecting the output of the model while larger values represent greater parameter sensitivity 3 results and discussion 3 1 definition of baseline scenario a set of baseline fracture apertures were defined as a starting point from which conceptual modifications could be made to generate a hydraulic response that best matched the liner installation test field data initially fracture apertures were selected to approximate the transmissivity profile obtained from previously completed constant head injection tests in kf6 elmhirst and novakowski 2012 where the cubic law was used to relate transmissivity to fracture aperture if multiple fractures occurred within the span of a single packer interval fracture apertures were determined so that the sum of their transmissivity would equal that of the corresponding packer interval this includes the seventh dummy fracture positioned at the bottom of the borehole refer to section 2 2 which was aligned arbitrarily with the deepest packer testing interval with noted transmissivity this approach yielded horizontal fracture apertures of approximately 279 348 127 13 318 582 and 352 μm a vertical fracture was assumed to intersect all seven fractures and was assigned an aperture of 200 μm a transmissivity profile representative of the proposed model fractures is presented alongside the transmissivity profile obtained from packer testing fig 7 while there is good correspondence between the profiles in the shallow portion of the borehole obvious discrepancy is observed below 28 0 mbgs this reflects the absence of identified fractures in persaud 2017 and persaud et al 2018 and the corresponding exclusion of fractures in this study qualitatively the shape of the modelled hydraulic response for this initial fracture aperture scenario shows fair correspondence to the field observations fig 8 a however the simulation overestimates the average head response by a factor of five and misrepresents the relative magnitude of change between peaks to better match average simulated head change to the average observed head change the horizontal fracture apertures were multiplied by a factor of 1 0 1 7 where 1 0 signifies no change fig 8 b this approach maintained relative differences in aperture between the fractures an increase in fracture aperture by a factor of 1 7 resulted in an average simulated change in head of 0 128 m within 1 of the observed change in head of 0 129 m therefore these fracture apertures listed as follows were used moving forward as a baseline case 486 606 220 22 553 1012 and 613 μm 3 2 sensitivity analysis the sensitivity of the simulated head response to input variables including horizontal and vertical fracture aperture inter well flow path length fracture storage and vertical fracture location was investigated in a series of seven scenarios fig 9 the outputs from each simulation were compared to outputs from the baseline simulation section 3 1 using the relative sensitivity as defined in eq 4 results shown in table 2 fig 9 a and b show the effects of horizontal and vertical fracture aperture respectively on the simulated head response observed head response decreases with an increase in both average horizontal fracture aperture and vertical fracture aperture this phenomenon is reasonable given that increasing fracture aperture increases transmissivity as per the cubic law as well as increases the available volume for water storage within the formation and may therefore facilitate pressure dissipation using the kf5 kf6 distance as an analogy to flow path length the well spacing was varied from the baseline of 9 43 m actual well separation distance as shown in fig 9 c this was done to assess the simplifying assumption of horizontal fractures since angled fractures would have a greater effective flow path length increasing flow path length was found to have a minimal effect on simulation results for example an increase in flow path length to 21 5 m reduced observation well response by only 0 02 m as such the assumption that angled fractures can be modelled as horizontal is considered reasonable for this simulation fig 9 d1 and d2 demonstrate the effect of fracture aperture under different conditions of vertical fracture connectivity fractures 1 and 2 were disconnected from fractures 3 7 by shortening the vertical fracture for scenario d1 the aperture of fracture 1 was adjusted independent of all others fig 9 d1 shows that the aperture of fracture 1 affects the simulated response only until fracture 1 is sealed at 173 s after this time there is no connection between fracture 1 and the kf5 middle well screen so fracture 1 aperture does not affect the head response before 173 s larger apertures result in a dampened response in the observation well with the same fracture configuration i e fractures 1 and 2 disconnected from fractures 3 7 the effect of fracture 6 aperture was investigated fig 9 d2 as with fracture 1 a larger aperture for fracture 6 results in a smaller head response in kf5 middle however in contrast to scenario d1 the effect is more pronounced and can be observed for the entire duration of the simulation fracture 6 had a larger baseline aperture than fracture 1 1012 μm vs 486 μm and provides a direct connection between kf6 and the kf5 middle well screen due to the location and length of the kf5 middle screened interval flow from other fractures must travel through fracture 6 to reach the observation well even after fracture 6 is sealed in kf6 at 1433 s the model is still sensitive to its aperture this is likely because flow in fracture 6 from fracture 7 is maintained via the vertical fracture connection fig 9 e and f show the effects of fracture specific storage and vertical fracture location respectively on simulation results fracture specific storage adjusted over a range extending from 1 10 10 to 1 10 1 m 1 was found to have little impact on the simulated kf5 middle head similarly position of the vertical fracture 200 μm aperture was found to have a negligible impact on the kf5 middle head response based on the examined input variables and their relative sensitivity table 2 the kf5 middle head response is most sensitive to changes in average horizontal fracture aperture relative sensitivity of 2 5 3 6 with the greatest sensitivity observed for larger aperture values however as evidenced by scenarios d1 and d2 the sensitivity to changes in fracture aperture may be dependent on fracture connectivity i e vertical fracture intersection and the corresponding bulk transmissivity of the block of fractured bedrock between the two wells the model is least sensitive to fracture specific storage relative sensitivity of 2 3 10 9 6 3 10 2 and vertical fracture positioning relative sensitivity of 1 3 10 5 4 6 10 5 3 3 final model configuration model configuration and fracture inputs were manually adjusted to minimize the error between field observations and simulated heads with the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient as the objective function for liner installation in kf6 final simulation results are shown relative to the observed kf5 middle head change in fig 10 a along with the final fracture configuration fig 10 b fracture aperture and transmissivity values for this simulation are shown in table 3 simulation results largely support the six active fractures delineated in persaud 2017 and persaud et al 2018 that are believed to be controlling flow from kf6 during borehole liner installation the first two fractures at approximately 5 2 mbgs and 7 9 mbgs are conceptualized as being isolated from the lower 5 fractures no connection via the vertical fracture as such hydraulic connection between these fractures and the lower fractures only exists through the borehole kf6 which provides cross connection until fracture 1 is sealed at 173 s and fracture 2 is sealed at 355 s consequently the apertures of fractures 1 and 2 only affect the kf5 head response before 173 s and 355 s respectively fracture 3 10 3 mbgs was assigned a smaller aperture 220 μm and is the least transmissive fracture 6 3 10 6 m2 s fracture 4 13 4 mbgs was assigned an aperture of 0 μm based on previous below detection limit transmissivity measurements elmhirst and novakowski 2012 for this region of the borehole fracture 6 16 3 mbgs was assigned the largest aperture 960 µm the head response in kf5 middle is particularly sensitive to this fracture it maintains a hydraulic connection to fractures 3 7 throughout the simulation via the vertical fracture equidistant between kf5 and kf6 additionally fracture 6 provides a direct connection between the kf6 source borehole and the kf5 middle well screen the nash sutcliffe value for this simulation was 0 85 indicating good overall correspondence between the field observations and the model simulation fig 10 a this correlation is best from 0 600 s while from 900 to 1200 s the model underestimates the response abrupt changes in the simulated head response occur at 173 s and 355 s when fractures 1 and 2 are sealed these are large fractures which together carry 37 of the flow before 355 s when they are sealed flow is redistributed to the lower fractures which are better connected to the kf5 middle well screen the variation in head response that occurs in between the sealing of fractures is due to changing borehole liner descent velocity and subsequent fracture flow rate for example at 1177 s there is a rapid reduction in the flow rate and a corresponding change in the head response transmissivity was calculated for the modelled fractures using the cubic law bulk borehole transmissivity i e fracture transmissivity summed over the length of the borehole can be compared to that previously estimated from constant head injection testing in kf6 i e transmissivity summed over all packer intervals note that this approach yields a single hole estimation of transmissivity in comparison to the cross hole transmissivity estimated in persaud et al 2018 despite a more limited distribution of transmissivity along the borehole length based on the location of simulated fractures the presented modelling exercise suggests a larger bulk borehole transmissivity 1 3 10 3 m2 s than the packer testing data 2 1 10 4 m2 s potential error in this hgs derived transmissivity estimate is recognized due to a loss of superposition in time as discussed in section 2 2 it is possible that fracture apertures in hgs may be overestimated due to potential scale effects constant head injection testing measures a small near borehole area whereas the bulk borehole transmissivity estimated from this investigation is based on inter borehole observations sampling a larger area of the formation is likely to increase estimated transmissivity due to the spatial heterogeneity of fractures discrepancy in parameter estimates between small and large scale hydraulic testing methods is a common occurrence in fractured bedrock sanchez vila et al 1996 schulze makuch and cherkauer 1998 nastev et al 2004 kurikami et al 2008 in this investigation inconsistencies in estimated transmissivity may also be explained by the study limitations summarized in table 4 4 conclusions the presented investigation complements the novel cross hole testing method described in persaud et al 2018 this study demonstrates the viability of a numerical modelling approach to simulate transient hydraulic response observed in a nearby borehole during liner installation in fractured crystalline bedrock the principles of borehole liner descent and the associated sealing of transmissive source hole fractures as presented in keller et al 2014 are built upon however prior to this investigation the hydraulic interference generated by liner installation via connected inter borehole fractures had yet to be simulated the proposed method allows for the efficient generation of input files the running of several sub simulations each with a different source well length the passing of head distributions between these sub simulations and subsequent production of a single output file showing the head response in kf5 the numerical modeling approach allows for the examination of conceptual model uncertainty through sensitivity and scenario testing fracture connectivity fracture aperture and vertical fracture characteristics are all parameters that can be modified to adjust the model output to best match observed field measurements the constructed model was found to be most sensitive to the assigned horizontal fracture apertures especially in fractures well connected to the observation monitoring interval results from the completed modelling show good correlation between the simulated hydraulic response and field observations providing support for the conceptualized fracture network between wells kf5 and kf6 at the examined field site however when used to assess hydraulic properties estimated bulk borehole transmissivity was found to exceed that previously estimated from constant head injection testing elmhirst and novakowski 2012 by nearly an order of magnitude this study indicates several areas where method refinement e g inclusion of angled and variable aperture fractures could improve the fit between observed and simulated liner installation data and consequent transmissivity estimates as well as address issues of solution non uniqueness as recognized in persaud et al 2018 enhancements to the executed field techniques used to generate the data featured in this study are also needed this would provide greater confidence in the completed simulations and conceptualized fracture network furthermore rigorous testing of the model with another independent data set would allow for a better assessment of the proposed modelling approach nevertheless hgs and numerical modelling as a whole is a promising supporting tool for the characterization of fractured media through cross hole borehole liner

6012,fractured bedrock aquifers provide an important source of drinking water in many regions around the world in settings with low matrix porosity and a small number of highly transmissive features such as crystalline bedrock high groundwater velocities through connected fracture pathways can increase aquifer vulnerability to contamination multiple fracture network characterization techniques e g geological geophysical and hydraulic are available to better understand this vulnerability conceptualizations of fracture network connectivity may be examined through the use of numerical models recently data gathered during the installation of flute blank liners have been used to assess cross hole transmissivity and fracture interconnections modelling and interpreting this type of hydraulic test presents a challenge since the open borehole length decreases during a liner installation this study provides a method to simulate a flute liner installation using hydrogeosphere a finite element code capable of simulating 3d transient flow conditions in discrete fracture networks results from previously published studies are used to inform the initial model configuration from which the sensitivity to various inputs including fracture aperture are then assessed good correlation between simulated and observed hydraulic response profiles was obtained however modelled fracture apertures yield an estimated bulk borehole transmissivity of 1 3 10 3 m2 s which was found to exceed a previous estimate of 2 1 10 4 m2 s obtained from constant head injection testing this may suggest overestimation of fracture apertures in the presented approach nonetheless this study supports numerical modelling as a viable method to simulate borehole liner installations keywords flute liner installation cross hole transient hydraulic response analysis numerical modelling fracture connectivity crystalline bedrock 1 introduction fractured bedrock aquifers represent a significant portion of aquifer systems worldwide and have tremendous importance for water resource use however these systems can be exceedingly complex and may be particularly susceptible to contamination the fractures and joints provide fast conduits for groundwater flow and can contribute to rapid contaminant transport e g levison and novakowski 2012 gellasch et al 2013 an improved understanding of the fracture network can allow predictions to be made on contaminant flow paths and travel times thereby providing a framework for decision making with regards to remediation monitoring and site management parker

be used however these methods can have drawbacks for example pumping tests may be associated with significant fluid displacement problematic at contaminated sites pulse interference tests especially those involving isolated test sections can be time and resource demanding and flow meter testing may be afflicted by issues concerning representativeness flute liner installations keller et al 2014 represent a potential new method for cross hole hydraulic characterization persaud et al 2018 compared the response of multiple liner installations to infer location and connectivity of major fracture zones as well as estimate transmissivity between boreholes using a conventional type curve analysis see persaud et al 2018 for more details however this analysis relied on several general assumptions and was unable to account for the continuously changing length of the open borehole that occurs during a liner installation further issues with solution non uniqueness warrant the exploration of an alternative numerical approach for the analysis of borehole hydraulic response data measured during nearby liner installation using field data to constrain model inputs the primary objective of this study is to numerically simulate the hydraulic response to borehole liner installations as evidence of discrete fracture connections within a borehole network it is anticipated that this approach will be an improvement over existing methods by enabling a more realistic representation of changing open borehole length and allowing for the examination of multiple fracture network conceptualizations to

jaoude et al 2018 zhu and zhan 2018 in this paper hgs is explored as a potential numerical modelling option for simulating discrete fracture flow during borehole liner installation tests and thus is used to further examine the practical use of this cross hole testing approach the specific objectives of this study are to 1 determine the viability of numerically simulating a borehole liner installation as a means of cross hole hydraulic testing and fracture network characterization 2 simulate the borehole liner installation in the fracture network conceptualized by persaud et al 2018 and 3 assess the relative sensitivity of hgs model inputs for these conditions 2 methods 2 1 site description field data used in this modelling investigation were collected at a queen s university research station near tamworth ontario canada fig 1 a the subsurface consists of fractured gneissic bedrock with minimal overburden 1 5 m and surface outcrops observed at the site persaud et al 2018 a series of eight boreholes were constructed in the bedrock with seven vertical holes kf2 3 4 5 6 7 and 9 and one angled borehole kf8 boreholes kf2 3 4 5 and 9 were percussion drilled 156 mm diameter while kf6 7 and 8 were drilled using hq triple tube 96 mm in diameter all boreholes are open over the depth of the bedrock except for kf5 which was completed as a multi level piezometer three monitoring intervals created through the insertion of slotted 51 mm pvc pipe were isolated in this borehole with sand separated by bentonite confining layers and are referred to as kf5 upper kf5 middle and kf5 lower extensive hydraulic characterization has previously been performed at the site constant head injection tests were conducted on all boreholes using a straddle packer system having a packer spacing ranging from approximately 2 0 2 5 m elmhirst and novakowski 2012 these tests were conducted in continuous succession to provide transmissivity profiles with depth borehole geophysics were also performed including logs for formation conductivity natural gamma full waveform sonic active line source temperature and acoustic televiewer the latter of which is most relevant to this particular study additional pulse interference tests and pumping tests were performed in kf 2 3 and 4 elmhirst and novakowski 2012 persaud et al 2018 further advanced the understanding of the fracture network at this site through a series of cross hole liner installation tests fig 2 that were used to indicate the location of probable fracture zones and estimate inter borehole transmissivity six liner installation tests were completed by persaud et al 2018 during which a total of 21 well pair combinations were examined for the purposes of this study the kf5 kf6 pair was selected for simulation six features were identified as probable flow paths between the kf5 kf6 well pair table 1 and fig 1 b the hydraulic response measured in kf5 observation well from liner installation in kf6 source well was considered in combination with borehole acoustic televiewer logs to target these potential preferential flow paths 2 2 numerical modelling approach hgs was used to simulate liner descent in kf6 assuming a fully saturated model domain the examined kf5 kf6 well pair represents the final two boreholes remaining open in the completed sequence of consecutive installations all others lined as a result the potentially confounding effect of additional open boreholes on site and associated fracture cross connection is removed for this modelling exercise fractures were positioned at elevations in the source hole kf6 proposed by persaud 2017 and persaud et al 2018 as shown in table 1 these fractures were numbered sequentially from 1 shallowest to 7 deepest since the borehole liner continued to descend after fracture 6 was sealed at 16 3 mbgs persaud 2017 persaud et al 2018 it is likely that additional fractures exist below this point that allow displacement of water into the subsurface but were not previously identified therefore a seventh fracture was added in the model at the bottom of the borehole 44 5 mbgs to accommodate this flow the presence of a deeper transmissive zone is supported by previously completed constant head injection testing in this borehole elmhirst and novakowski 2012 furthermore the kf6 acoustic televiewer log indicates a number of potentially transmissive features in the vicinity of this seventh fracture suggesting that its placement is not unrealistic for the purpose of this study fractures were assumed to be horizontal and to extend to the edge of the model domain grid shown in fig 3 this orthogonal system is an approximation of reality that was implemented to simplify the discretization an arbitrary vertical fracture was defined equidistant between the two wells to represent fracture intersection that would likely occur with the original angled fractures the effect of the aperture and position of this vertical fracture was investigated during simulations wells kf5 and kf6 were defined in the center of the domain these boreholes were explicitly simulated in hgs as fluid filled wells with radii representative of actual well design saturated flow along the axis of each well was described according to the hagen poiseuille formula therrien and sudicky 2000 with a common node approach used to couple the well and surrounding subsurface media the observation well kf5 is screened over three intervals i e three open segments defined in hgs kf5 lower 25 3 38 2 mbgs kf5 middle 15 5 20 2 mbgs and kf5 upper open 0 0 10 7 mbgs during the field experiment persaud 2017 persaud et al 2018 kf5 middle showed the strongest head response while kf5 upper showed a weaker response and kf5 lower showed almost no response consequently this study focuses on the kf5 middle response for which an observation node was defined at the center of the monitoring interval kf6 was defined as open along its entire length from 0 0 mbgs 45 0 mbgs and injection nodes were placed in the well at the intersection points of each fracture to represent the flow of displaced borehole water a constant head boundary condition of 49 0 m 1 0 mbgs was defined for the four vertical faces of the domain with 2000 m 2000 m 50 m extents this domain was bounded on the top and bottom by a free surface and no flow boundary condition respectively a simple pumping test case using an initial head of 49 0 m was developed to determine the coarsest grid discretization that could be used without significantly affecting results in order to minimize run times grid generation and discretization were completed within hgs for this test scenario all fractures were assigned an arbitrary aperture of 400 μm and specific storage of 0 0001 m 1 with a constant applied pumping rate i e nodal flux at each fracture kf5 was used as a test observation well assumed to be open along its entire length with pumping in kf6 discretization in the x and y direction around each well was adjusted independent of discretization in the z direction around fractures with minimum and maximum cell dimensions manipulated as well as the grading factor multiplicative until changes in hydraulic head response were within 0 5 a resulting mesh of 181 000 nodes was generated with nodal spacing of 0 1 500 0 m in the x and y direction and nodal spacing of 0 1 5 0 m in the z direction this discretization is comparable to that used in previous investigations for flow simulations e g levison and novakowski 2012 jaoude et al 2018 but it is likely that if this model were to be used for transport simulations further grid refinement would be required weatherill et al 2008 the mesh was further assessed for potential impact of boundary conditions the same pumping test scenario as discussed above was simulated using an enlarged grid 20 000 m 20 000 m 50 m identical drawdown profiles were obtained for both the 2000 m 2000 m 50 m and 20 000 m 20 000 m 50 m domains indicating negligible boundary condition effects and supporting use of the smaller domain finally to validate model performance a comparison was made between transmissivity estimated via the cubic law snow 1965 as shown in eq 1 and that estimated using an analytical solution hgs pumping test results were fit with the theis 1935 solution in which a homogeneous confined aquifer of infinite extent is assumed transmissivity estimated additively using the cubic law 2 6 10 4 m2 s was within 10 of the transmissivity estimated from the drawdown curve 3 0 10 4 m2 s it should be noted that during this exercise and throughout the remainder of the manuscript effective fracture transmissivity t f l2 t and equivalent hydraulic fracture aperture 2 b l are used interchangeably according to the relationship defined in eq 1 1 2 b 12 μ t f ρ g 1 3 where μ is the viscosity of water m lt ρ is the density of water m l3 g is the gravitational acceleration l t2 to partition flow amongst fractures for the examined liner installation it was assumed that the sum of the transmissivity of all fractures must equal the bulk borehole transmissivity similarly as a borehole liner descends the flow rate out of all fractures must sum to the total volume of water displaced into the fracture network through time this overall flow rate is partitioned amongst the fractures as a function of fracture aperture it was found that flow rate through a single fracture can be considered as a cubed aperture weighted flow rate eq 2 2 q i 2 b i 3 i 1 n 2 b i 3 q t where q i is the flow rate through fracture i l3 t 2 b i is the aperture of fracture i l q t is the total flow rate l3 t and n is the number of unsealed fractures so that i 1 n 2 b i 3 represents the sum of the cubed aperture of n unsealed fractures as the simulation progresses the number of unsealed fractures decreases and the ratio q i q t changes the velocity of the liner descent depends on the transmissivity of the remaining unsealed portion of the borehole therefore as the borehole liner velocity changes with time so does the total flow rate q t and the flow rate through each of the remaining unsealed fractures q i these time dependent fracture flow rates volumetric fluxes were calculated for each active fracture sealed inactive fractures were assigned a rate of 0 m3 s and assigned to an injection node placed at the intersection of kf6 and each fracture as shown in the conceptual model fig 4 the designation of active versus inactive fractures was based on field measurements of liner descent persaud 2017 for the kf5 kf6 borehole liner installation as the liner descends it reduces the effective length of the borehole consequently it was assumed that simulations involving variable source well length would best represent this phenomenon given that hgs requires a single well length for each simulation it was necessary to break the simulation down into seven separate sub simulations to approximate the variable well length fig 5 each sub simulation represents the liner descent between two fractures and each sub simulation uses a different length for the kf6 well the first sub simulation represents the descent of the liner from the water table to just below fracture 1 the second sub simulation represents the descent of the liner from just below fracture 1 to just below fracture 2 and so on to run the sub simulations in series the output head distribution for the first sub simulation was used as the initial head distribution for the second sub simulation this was repeated for all seven sub simulations hgs does not have a graphical user interface and the input files are written in text format multiple scripts microsoft excel vba python and batch files were used to generate hgs input files and folder structures pass output from simulations to proceeding simulations run the hgs executables and to combine all the resultant head files into a single output file this workflow is summarized in fig 6 this allowed for efficient testing of a wide range of input conditions after the results of the sub simulations were combined into a single output file the head time series was analyzed and compared to field observations it is acknowledged that by stopping and starting the model with a new initial condition a static head distribution at the start of each sub simulation is assumed when in reality the flow field continues to change due to previous conditions to examine this assumption a simple test case based on the pumping test scenario described above with variable flow rates in sequential sub simulations was compared to an analogous analytical solution theis 1935 for which superposition is automatically applied additive transmissivity estimated via the cubic law for the hgs test case 2 6 10 4 m2 s was found to differ by less than half an order of magnitude relative to the analytical solution 1 2 10 4 m2 s this error must be considered in the final estimate of transmissivity determined from the model 2 3 statistical assessment of the results two statistical measures were used to assess both the quality of the model and the sensitivity of the model to its inputs to assess model quality the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient was calculated for each simulation using eq 3 nash and sutcliffe 1970 3 e 1 t 1 t s sim t s obs t 2 t 1 t s obs t s obs 2 where e is the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient ssim is the simulated head change l and sobs is the observed head change l the simulated and observed values were compared at each model output time t and the nash sutcliffe value was calculated over the first 2000 s t the nash sutcliffe value is defined as having a range from to 1 with 1 representing a perfect fit between the simulations and the field observations the nash sutcliffe value has been widely used in past hydrogeological investigations to assess model outputs including groundwater hydraulic head in a quantitative manner e g chandio et al 2012 hong et al 2016 whittecar et al 2017 nguyen and dietrich 2018 in this study nash sutcliffe efficiency was used as a performance metric given the fine temporal resolution of observed head data used to fit the hgs model this time series allows for the calculation of a meaningful nash sutcliffe value to assess the sensitivity of model parameters relative sensitivity was calculated as described in eq 4 mccuen 1973 4 s r o a o r p a p r p r o r where s r is the relative sensitivity o a is the adjusted output the average head response in kf5 middle l o r is reference output the average head response in kf5 middle for the baseline case l p a is the adjusted parameter e g average horizontal aperture l p r is the reference parameter e g average horizontal aperture for the baseline case l similar to the nash sutcliffe value relative sensitivity was calculated for the average change in kf5 middle head over first 2000 s of the simulation a value close to 0 represents low parameter sensitivity i e the parameter can be adjusted without significantly affecting the output of the model while larger values represent greater parameter sensitivity 3 results and discussion 3 1 definition of baseline scenario a set of baseline fracture apertures were defined as a starting point from which conceptual modifications could be made to generate a hydraulic response that best matched the liner installation test field data initially fracture apertures were selected to approximate the transmissivity profile obtained from previously completed constant head injection tests in kf6 elmhirst and novakowski 2012 where the cubic law was used to relate transmissivity to fracture aperture if multiple fractures occurred within the span of a single packer interval fracture apertures were determined so that the sum of their transmissivity would equal that of the corresponding packer interval this includes the seventh dummy fracture positioned at the bottom of the borehole refer to section 2 2 which was aligned arbitrarily with the deepest packer testing interval with noted transmissivity this approach yielded horizontal fracture apertures of approximately 279 348 127 13 318 582 and 352 μm a vertical fracture was assumed to intersect all seven fractures and was assigned an aperture of 200 μm a transmissivity profile representative of the proposed model fractures is presented alongside the transmissivity profile obtained from packer testing fig 7 while there is good correspondence between the profiles in the shallow portion of the borehole obvious discrepancy is observed below 28 0 mbgs this reflects the absence of identified fractures in persaud 2017 and persaud et al 2018 and the corresponding exclusion of fractures in this study qualitatively the shape of the modelled hydraulic response for this initial fracture aperture scenario shows fair correspondence to the field observations fig 8 a however the simulation overestimates the average head response by a factor of five and misrepresents the relative magnitude of change between peaks to better match average simulated head change to the average observed head change the horizontal fracture apertures were multiplied by a factor of 1 0 1 7 where 1 0 signifies no change fig 8 b this approach maintained relative differences in aperture between the fractures an increase in fracture aperture by a factor of 1 7 resulted in an average simulated change in head of 0 128 m within 1 of the observed change in head of 0 129 m therefore these fracture apertures listed as follows were used moving forward as a baseline case 486 606 220 22 553 1012 and 613 μm 3 2 sensitivity analysis the sensitivity of the simulated head response to input variables including horizontal and vertical fracture aperture inter well flow path length fracture storage and vertical fracture location was investigated in a series of seven scenarios fig 9 the outputs from each simulation were compared to outputs from the baseline simulation section 3 1 using the relative sensitivity as defined in eq 4 results shown in table 2 fig 9 a and b show the effects of horizontal and vertical fracture aperture respectively on the simulated head response observed head response decreases with an increase in both average horizontal fracture aperture and vertical fracture aperture this phenomenon is reasonable given that increasing fracture aperture increases transmissivity as per the cubic law as well as increases the available volume for water storage within the formation and may therefore facilitate pressure dissipation using the kf5 kf6 distance as an analogy to flow path length the well spacing was varied from the baseline of 9 43 m actual well separation distance as shown in fig 9 c this was done to assess the simplifying assumption of horizontal fractures since angled fractures would have a greater effective flow path length increasing flow path length was found to have a minimal effect on simulation results for example an increase in flow path length to 21 5 m reduced observation well response by only 0 02 m as such the assumption that angled fractures can be modelled as horizontal is considered reasonable for this simulation fig 9 d1 and d2 demonstrate the effect of fracture aperture under different conditions of vertical fracture connectivity fractures 1 and 2 were disconnected from fractures 3 7 by shortening the vertical fracture for scenario d1 the aperture of fracture 1 was adjusted independent of all others fig 9 d1 shows that the aperture of fracture 1 affects the simulated response only until fracture 1 is sealed at 173 s after this time there is no connection between fracture 1 and the kf5 middle well screen so fracture 1 aperture does not affect the head response before 173 s larger apertures result in a dampened response in the observation well with the same fracture configuration i e fractures 1 and 2 disconnected from fractures 3 7 the effect of fracture 6 aperture was investigated fig 9 d2 as with fracture 1 a larger aperture for fracture 6 results in a smaller head response in kf5 middle however in contrast to scenario d1 the effect is more pronounced and can be observed for the entire duration of the simulation fracture 6 had a larger baseline aperture than fracture 1 1012 μm vs 486 μm and provides a direct connection between kf6 and the kf5 middle well screen due to the location and length of the kf5 middle screened interval flow from other fractures must travel through fracture 6 to reach the observation well even after fracture 6 is sealed in kf6 at 1433 s the model is still sensitive to its aperture this is likely because flow in fracture 6 from fracture 7 is maintained via the vertical fracture connection fig 9 e and f show the effects of fracture specific storage and vertical fracture location respectively on simulation results fracture specific storage adjusted over a range extending from 1 10 10 to 1 10 1 m 1 was found to have little impact on the simulated kf5 middle head similarly position of the vertical fracture 200 μm aperture was found to have a negligible impact on the kf5 middle head response based on the examined input variables and their relative sensitivity table 2 the kf5 middle head response is most sensitive to changes in average horizontal fracture aperture relative sensitivity of 2 5 3 6 with the greatest sensitivity observed for larger aperture values however as evidenced by scenarios d1 and d2 the sensitivity to changes in fracture aperture may be dependent on fracture connectivity i e vertical fracture intersection and the corresponding bulk transmissivity of the block of fractured bedrock between the two wells the model is least sensitive to fracture specific storage relative sensitivity of 2 3 10 9 6 3 10 2 and vertical fracture positioning relative sensitivity of 1 3 10 5 4 6 10 5 3 3 final model configuration model configuration and fracture inputs were manually adjusted to minimize the error between field observations and simulated heads with the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient as the objective function for liner installation in kf6 final simulation results are shown relative to the observed kf5 middle head change in fig 10 a along with the final fracture configuration fig 10 b fracture aperture and transmissivity values for this simulation are shown in table 3 simulation results largely support the six active fractures delineated in persaud 2017 and persaud et al 2018 that are believed to be controlling flow from kf6 during borehole liner installation the first two fractures at approximately 5 2 mbgs and 7 9 mbgs are conceptualized as being isolated from the lower 5 fractures no connection via the vertical fracture as such hydraulic connection between these fractures and the lower fractures only exists through the borehole kf6 which provides cross connection until fracture 1 is sealed at 173 s and fracture 2 is sealed at 355 s consequently the apertures of fractures 1 and 2 only affect the kf5 head response before 173 s and 355 s respectively fracture 3 10 3 mbgs was assigned a smaller aperture 220 μm and is the least transmissive fracture 6 3 10 6 m2 s fracture 4 13 4 mbgs was assigned an aperture of 0 μm based on previous below detection limit transmissivity measurements elmhirst and novakowski 2012 for this region of the borehole fracture 6 16 3 mbgs was assigned the largest aperture 960 µm the head response in kf5 middle is particularly sensitive to this fracture it maintains a hydraulic connection to fractures 3 7 throughout the simulation via the vertical fracture equidistant between kf5 and kf6 additionally fracture 6 provides a direct connection between the kf6 source borehole and the kf5 middle well screen the nash sutcliffe value for this simulation was 0 85 indicating good overall correspondence between the field observations and the model simulation fig 10 a this correlation is best from 0 600 s while from 900 to 1200 s the model underestimates the response abrupt changes in the simulated head response occur at 173 s and 355 s when fractures 1 and 2 are sealed these are large fractures which together carry 37 of the flow before 355 s when they are sealed flow is redistributed to the lower fractures which are better connected to the kf5 middle well screen the variation in head response that occurs in between the sealing of fractures is due to changing borehole liner descent velocity and subsequent fracture flow rate for example at 1177 s there is a rapid reduction in the flow rate and a corresponding change in the head response transmissivity was calculated for the modelled fractures using the cubic law bulk borehole transmissivity i e fracture transmissivity summed over the length of the borehole can be compared to that previously estimated from constant head injection testing in kf6 i e transmissivity summed over all packer intervals note that this approach yields a single hole estimation of transmissivity in comparison to the cross hole transmissivity estimated in persaud et al 2018 despite a more limited distribution of transmissivity along the borehole length based on the location of simulated fractures the presented modelling exercise suggests a larger bulk borehole transmissivity 1 3 10 3 m2 s than the packer testing data 2 1 10 4 m2 s potential error in this hgs derived transmissivity estimate is recognized due to a loss of superposition in time as discussed in section 2 2 it is possible that fracture apertures in hgs may be overestimated due to potential scale effects constant head injection testing measures a small near borehole area whereas the bulk borehole transmissivity estimated from this investigation is based on inter borehole observations sampling a larger area of the formation is likely to increase estimated transmissivity due to the spatial heterogeneity of fractures discrepancy in parameter estimates between small and large scale hydraulic testing methods is a common occurrence in fractured bedrock sanchez vila et al 1996 schulze makuch and cherkauer 1998 nastev et al 2004 kurikami et al 2008 in this investigation inconsistencies in estimated transmissivity may also be explained by the study limitations summarized in table 4 4 conclusions the presented investigation complements the novel cross hole testing method described in persaud et al 2018 this study demonstrates the viability of a numerical modelling approach to simulate transient hydraulic response observed in a nearby borehole during liner installation in fractured crystalline bedrock the principles of borehole liner descent and the associated sealing of transmissive source hole fractures as presented in keller et al 2014 are built upon however prior to this investigation the hydraulic interference generated by liner installation via connected inter borehole fractures had yet to be simulated the proposed method allows for the efficient generation of input files the running of several sub simulations each with a different source well length the passing of head distributions between these sub simulations and subsequent production of a single output file showing the head response in kf5 the numerical modeling approach allows for the examination of conceptual model uncertainty through sensitivity and scenario testing fracture connectivity fracture aperture and vertical fracture characteristics are all parameters that can be modified to adjust the model output to best match observed field measurements the constructed model was found to be most sensitive to the assigned horizontal fracture apertures especially in fractures well connected to the observation monitoring interval results from the completed modelling show good correlation between the simulated hydraulic response and field observations providing support for the conceptualized fracture network between wells kf5 and kf6 at the examined field site however when used to assess hydraulic properties estimated bulk borehole transmissivity was found to exceed that previously estimated from constant head injection testing elmhirst and novakowski 2012 by nearly an order of magnitude this study indicates several areas where method refinement e g inclusion of angled and variable aperture fractures could improve the fit between observed and simulated liner installation data and consequent transmissivity estimates as well as address issues of solution non uniqueness as recognized in persaud et al 2018 enhancements to the executed field techniques used to generate the data featured in this study are also needed this would provide greater confidence in the completed simulations and conceptualized fracture network furthermore rigorous testing of the model with another independent data set would allow for a better assessment of the proposed modelling approach nevertheless hgs and numerical modelling as a whole is a promising supporting tool for the characterization of fractured media through cross hole borehole liner

6013,a part of the balkan ultramafic massif is situated in western serbia and belongs to a mountain range with several prominent peaks including mt tara mt zlatibor and mt zlatar the porosity of ultramafic rocks is generally very low such that they are classified as nearly or completely waterless rocks however due to tectonic activity and exogenic processes over geologic time some ultramafic rocks exhibit a certain level of secondary fracture porosity hydraulically interconnected fractures can form aquifers of the fractured type such as the one found in gruda on mt zlatibor on this location the quality parameters of the groundwater in the fractured aquifer drained via a spring called bijela česma prompted detailed multidisciplinary investigations aimed at defining the elements of the aquifer for commercial water bottling purposes given that the investigations were comprehensive the results allowed high quality interpretation of the hydrogeologic conditions and provided the background for developing a hydrodynamic model of the fractured hydrogeologic system in the ultramafic rocks at gruda modflow software was used for modeling this software is primarily intended for intergranular aquifers but no programs are available for fractured aquifers in hard rocks with pronounced discontinuities modeling of the fractured aquifer in the ultramafic rocks at gruda provided the following information size of active infiltration surface hydraulic conductivity of the porous medium rate of recharge residence time of a drop of groundwater from entry to exit graphical representation of streamlines and the like despite these difficulties the results are satisfactory the values of the analyzed parameters are believed to be objective and indicate a certain possibility of using modflow in hydrodynamic modeling and solving hydrogeologic problems that involve hard rocks and fractured porosity in practice this is especially important for sanitary protection zoning of groundwater sources that rely on fractured aquifers keywords ultramafic rocks fractured aquifer hydrogeologic fracture system hydrodynamic model serbia 1 introduction a fractured aquifer is a highly complex hydrogeological system in most cases it is typically found in hard rocks igneous sedimentary or metamorphic of secondary porosity where primary porosity is either subordinate or non existent hydrogeological exploration of fractured aquifers often requires extensive multidisciplinary investigations and consequently substantial funding moreover each of the various exploration methods often contributes to a better understanding of only a segment of the puzzle that is a fractured aquifer rarely shedding light on the entire picture however the pieces of the puzzle put together in a hydrodynamic model offer a range of possibilities and solutions that provide a clearer and more accurate representation of the studied fractured aquifer this would be difficult to accomplish with conventional exploration approaches one hydrogeologically complex and very interesting aquifer of the fractured type is found in ultramafic rocks in an area called gruda on mt zlatibor in western serbia this particular aquifer is especially remarkable because of its recharge and drainage mechanisms and water quality adding to the attraction is the fact that over an area of about 25 km2 built up of jurassic ultramafic rocks there are permanent springs of the ascending type in relative proximity to each other two of them expel a water jet and the discharge of four is diffuse the water quality of the two gushing springs is extremely favorable from a nutritional perspective such that one has been captured for commercial water bottling for that purpose numerous complex and extensive investigations have been conducted a hydrodynamic model was constructed based on the results of investigations of the fractured aquifer in ultramafic rocks at gruda on mt zlatibor the input parameters for the model were the results of geological and hydrogeological investigations undertaken in two campaigns at different times the first in 2004 2006 and the second in 2012 2014 however during the course of analysis and synthesis of the results of the second multidisciplinary exploration campaign 2012 2014 and subsequent integrated assessment of both campaigns certain elements were noted that facilitated geological and hydrogeological interpretation and the development of a hydrodynamic model of the low alkaline fractured aquifer in the ultramafic rocks in gruda this favorable circumstance served as a basis for the present paper one of whose main contributions is showing how to model the hydrodynamics of a complex fractured aquifer in hard rocks specifically ultramafic rocks licensed commercial software gw vistas ver 6 modflow usgs edition available with several commercial interfaces was applied to a fractured aquifer the results of hydrodynamic modeling are indicative of the potential of this program in hydrogeological exploration of fractured porosity rocks this feature is especially valuable given that there are currently no commercial programs for fractured aquifers the results presented in the paper specifically for ultramafic rocks allow for comparison with other examples attempts of hydrodynamic modeling of other types of hard fractured porosity rocks also noteworthy is the fact that the paper revises certain conclusions nikić et al 2013 about the geologic framework of the study area geological age of the sediments in the kraljeva voda depression thickness of the ultramafics above the diabase chert formation and block like build up of the terrain 2 study area the study area is in a spacious ultramafic massif in western serbia west balkans south east europe fig 1 from a geological perspective the territory falls within the alps more specifically within the ophiolitic belt of the dinaric alps tectonic unit of the first order dimitrijević 2002 it is part of the ultramafic massif of the balkan peninsula one of the largest continuous ultramafic formations in europe brooks 1987 the study area is on mt zlatibor which is situated between mt tara in the northwest and mt zlatar in the southeast the surface area of mt zlatibor is about 1100 km2 and its ultramafic massif occupies roughly 1050 km2 hydrographically it belongs to the black sea basin the topographic water divided crosses mt zlatibor and divides the mountain into parts that fall within the catchments of the zapadna morava river to the north and the drina to the west geotectonically the ultramafic massif of mt zlatibor belongs to the central part of the dinaric ophiolitic belt which existed as an oceanic section from the middle triassic to the upper jurassic dimitrijević and dimitrijević 1973 karamata 2006 schmid et al 2008 many researchers have studied the dinaric ophiolitic belt and within it the zlatibor ultramafic massif based on geophysical investigations milovanović and mladenović 1966 67 report that the zlatibor massif originated from magma intrusions along a large fault of dinaric trending ćirić 1966 1967 believes that it evolved from submarine extrusions and emplacement of peridotites over a diabase chert formation mojsilović et al 1978 claim that the massif is a plate like body 1000 1200 thick which overlies the diabase chert formation and that along the fringes the thickness decreases to only several tens of meters vukašinović 1996 reports that tectonic and magmatic activity resulted in a mélange type nature of the diabase chert formation that magma intrusions occurred along deep dislocations and that movement of the sediment and magmatite blocks further complicated the build up of the ophiolites diabase chert formation and ultramafics additionally resulting in cold contacts between the sediments and magmatites according to mojsilović et al 1978 and dimitrijević 1996 mt zlatibor is mostly built up of upper jurassic ultramafics with some middle jurassic diabase cherts and triassic limestones in the northern part of mt zlatibor there is a spacious rolling plateau at elevations ranging from 850 to 1200 m fig 1 in the northeastern part of the plateau in an area called gruda there is a shallow depression named kraljeva voda there are two permanent springs of the ascending type in this depression from which water spurts and four permanent ascending springs of the diffuse type where water emerges over on area of 5 to 10 m2 a land area of some 25 km2 was selected which is bounded to the south by the peaks of lečića vrh 1091 m and tusto brdo 995 m to the north and northeast by peaks that arch from the northwest to the southeast velika gruda 1140 m škodrića priboj 1002 m čavik 1015 m and lađevac 940 m to the west by the kani potok and to the east by peaks from obadovica 981 m in the south to lađevac 940 m in the north figs 1 and 3 the captured spring with the largest discharge is called bijela česma bč the lower discharge spring not captured is hajdučko vrelo hv and the four diffuse ascending springs da are unnamed figs 3 5 and 9 the drainage network in the study area comprises four permanent streams kani potok bijele vode prdavac and bezimeni potok figs 1 and 3 as well as several ephemerals the streams are all ungauged and their general flow regime is pluvial nival after heavy rainfall or sudden snow melt the streams become torrents in the recession period their flow rate is from 0 5 l s to 1 5 l s no sinking of the streams was detected the source of the bijele vode is a karst spring oko os situated at a point of contact between triassic limestones and jurassic ultramafic rocks on the northern fringes of očka gora figs 1 and 3 the bezimeni potok is permanent from the ascending springs in the kraljeva voda depression the prdavac creek originates from a couple of springs whose capacity is less than 0 1 l s and which emerge from the diabase chert formation the catchment of the kani potok is largely beyond the study area its hardly visible permanent flow is formed by leaching waters immediately upstream from its junction with the bijele vode creek the major channels of all the streams are in the parent rocks they are 0 5 m to 1 4 m wide and 0 2 m to 0 5 m deep the study area belongs to the drina river catchment and thus to the danube river basin the study area is sparsely populated and the landscape features spacious mountain pastures and meadows and rare small and isolated white pine groves 3 material and methods the algorithm in fig 2 shows groups of activities undertaken during the two campaigns aimed at defining the elements of the fractured aquifer in ultramafic rocks geological and hydrogeological prospecting carried out in gruda encompassed a land area of around 30 km2 whose central part hosts the above mentioned ascending springs this activity provided basic information on the study area remote detection and photogeological assessment the objective of remote detection was to supplement existing data on the rupture pattern and assess the characteristics of the tectonic structures in the study area satellite imagery was assessed by monocular means and subsequent data interpretation referred to the regional geological framework described in available geological documentation photogeological assessment of the ruptures was undertaken to study the geological framework in more detail and identify tectonic structures geological and hydrogeological mapping on a scale of 1 25 000 covered an area of approximately 25 km2 in both campaigns the most important regional geological information was taken from yugoslav archives state geological map of the former yugoslavia scale 1 100 000 sheet k34 4 titovo užice and accompanying authentic handwritten material on a scale of 1 25 000 geophysical investigations were undertaken in the extended area of springs bč hv and da in the kraljeva voda depression roughly in the middle of the study area the resistivity method was applied for vertical and lateral identification of the lithologic units and to get an indication of the spatial positions of the fractures and aquifers the maximum half distance between the current electrodes c1c2 2max was 600 m which ensured that the investigated depth was approximately 350 m the self potential method was used to detect subsurface flow or in other words to determine if there were any springs masked by proluvial or alluvial sediments the objective of the mise a la masse method was to detect the positions and directions of fractures along which groundwater flows to the ascending springs neotectonic analysis the neotectonic activity in the gruda ultramafic rocks was reconstructed by quantitative geomorphological analysis relief energy was selected as a parameter relevant to the most recent movements of the earth s crust this parameter was processed by morphometric and statistical methods and the results were presented by means of isolines the relief energy was determined by the difference in height within a ground surface unit of 1 km2 statistical processing and reduction to the reference zero level yielded positive and negative relief energy values the first energy relief trend was calculated to eliminate the effect of exogenic processes and emphasize the effect of endogenous processes that lead to neotectonic activity marković 1983 soil testing the focus was on the thickness porosity and permeability of the soil overlying the ultramafic rocks exploratory drilling was undertaken to verify the results of mapping and geophysical and photogeological investigations as well as to gain insight into the nature of the fractures in the study area six boreholes were drilled during the first campaign and one ib 10 in the second up to a depth of 30 m a 3 piezometer casing was installed in the borehole to a depth of 29 90 m climate parameters annual precipitation is a significant meteorological parameter from the viewpoint of the amount of meteoric water that recharges the fractured aquifer in gruda it was also important for determining if there is a correlation between the amount of precipitation and the discharges of springs bč and hv the data were obtained from the synoptic station on mt zlatibor which is closest to the study area 3 8 km northeast observations of discharge rates temperatures and ph of spring water bč and hv were made in both campaigns both springs were observed at the same time at five day intervals the discharge rate of spring bč was monitored by the volumetric method and that of spring hv by a thomson weir hydrological monitoring of the bezimeni potok was conducted in the second campaign a small rectangular concrete dam was installed in the channel at approximately 150 m downstream from spring bč there are no permanent tributaries upstream the topographic catchment area is 0 3 km2 the objective was to determine the discharge of the bezimeni potok creek in the dry period when only groundwater from the ascending springs contributes to the flow geodetic surveys and determination of piezometric head at springs bč and hv were undertaken instrumentally during the second campaign the piezometric head of both springs was determined by installing an inverted funnel on each of the springs the top of the funnel was connected by a plastic tube diameter 2 whose opening was 1 8 m above the ground surface both springs were observed on the same day testing of physical properties and chemical compositions of spring water bč and hv was performed in both campaigns and included physical properties chemical gas microbial and biological compositions chrysotile asbestos concentrations and radioactivity total α β and γ isotope 3h and 14c analyses of spring water bč and hv tritium 3h isotope analyses were performed to check for a connection between groundwater and meteoric water and those of carbon 14c isotopes to determine the age of the groundwater in the second campaign one set of samples were tested in a single series in 2013 the activity of 14c was measured by accelerator mass spectrometry ams and of 3h by a liquid scintillation counter lsc whose lower limit of detection by electrolytic enrichment was 0 06 bq l and 0 5 t u 4 results 4 1 geologic framework of the study area the study area features mesozoic neogene and quaternary rocks the spatial position of the geologic formations is shown in fig 3 and the respective lithologic column in fig 4 mesozoic mesozoic rocks include limestones t3 a diabase chert formation j2 3 harzburgites σej3 3 lherzolites σdlj3 3 serpentinites sej3 3 and serpentinized and opalized harzburgites seop upper triassic limestones are found in the easternmost part of the study area called očka gora in a small tectonically bounded block whose surface area is about 0 9 km2 fig 3 in lithological terms the strata comprise thick stratified to banked limestones limestone dolomites and dolomites mojsilović et al 1978 dimitrijević and dimitrijević 1996 believe that the upper triassic limestones in mt zlatibor were first deposited over the drina ivanjica element in the paleozoic and that they later slid into an ophiolite mélange in the form of olistoplaques this is how a block of upper triassic limestones reached gruda in the study area fig 3 in the middle upper jurassic a diabase chert formation was created in the labile parts of the dinaric geosyncline a thick ultramafic body was formed in the basin over the diabase chert formation in the upper jurassic period along deep dislocations milovanović and mladenović 1966 67 ćirić 1966 67 mojsilović et al 1978 this resulted in the creation of a contact metamorphic belt represented by amphiboles honeycombed striped sillimanite gneisses gneiss micaschists phyllites and green schists however the lithology of most of the study area in gruda is rather uniform represented by upper jurassic ultramafic rocks the primary rocks are differentiates of harzburgite magma and the intensity of serpentinization varies full serpentinization is noted only along the fringes of the massif and in tectonized zones mojsilović et al 1978 the harzburgites are fractured on the ground surface but deeper down there is a fresh looking lithological unit of a massive texture and porphyroclastic structure which is very hard and light to dark green in color lherzolite is found in the northwestern part of the study area it is hard and compact on the ground surface with up to 1 cm wide fractures there are serpentinites in the northeastern and eastern parts of the study area on the ground surface and at small depths there are numerous 1 2 cm wide fractures which are unfilled or semi filled with earth or small fragments of hard rock weathering products in deeper parts the serpentinites are hard and light to dark green serpentinized and opalized harzburgite is found on a very small location between springs bč and hv there area numerous fissures up to 5 mm wide semi filled to unfilled these formations overlie semi serpentinized harzburgites given the uniform lithology of the harzburgites lherzolites and serpentinites in the study area as described above and in view of the topic of this paper the term ultramafics and the adjective ultramafic will be used hereafter neogene the paper by nikić et al from 2013 reported that the sediments in the central part of the study area within the shallow depression called kraljeva voda belong to the quaternary period however the research campaign undertaken in 2014 established that they are in fact miocene figs 3 and 4 the drilled sediments are lithologically represented by alternating layers of clay and angular ultramafic fragments whose size is 1 2 cm the thicknesses of these layers vary up to 0 6 m according to mojsilović et al 1978 these sediments originate from lacustrine and later marsh conditions in tectonic depressions at which time their floor probably sank slowly this mechanism facilitated profundal sedimentation with largely clay sediments alternating with interbeds of harzburgite fragments carried by erosion to the very edge of the depression quaternary the quaternary formations q2 are represented by fluvial and slopewash cycles their spread is not large and their thickness is up to 1 m fig 4 4 2 remote detection and photogeological assessment of the rupture pattern remote detection was primarily used to determine large regional discontinuities certain and inferred ruptures were identified from the photogeological assessment which indicated a relatively extensive rupture pattern in the entire study area 4 3 results of geophysical investigations 1 six geoelectric units were identified by the resistivity method modified for geoelectric sounding fig 4 unit i very low resistivity up to 17 ωm which comprises the lowest parts of the terrain in the kraljeva voda depression the thickness of this unit is approximately 25 m and in lithological terms there are alternating strata of clay and ultramafic fragments unit ii low resistivity from 6 ωm to 45 ωm forming the ground surface in the vicinity of all the probes the thickness is about 5 m and the lithology is represented by extensively fractured ultramafics in the weathering crust unit iii slightly elevated resistivity approximately 90 ωm to 260 ωm in the shallow parts of the terrain between springs bč and hv its thickness is 15 20 m and the lithology is represented by serpentinized and opalized harzburgite with honeycombed opal and a clay component unit iv elevated resistivity approximately 180 ωm to 310 ωm below unit ii the thickness is from 7 m to 13 m and the lithology comprises slightly cracked ultramafics in the weathering core unit v very high resistivity from 3500 ωm to 6200 ωm situated in deep parts of the terrain below unit iv the thickness of this unit is considerable ranging from about 115 m to 210 m and the lithology corresponds to compact ultramafics unit vi high resistivity 240 ωm to 1200 ωm representing the deepest parts of the terrain below unit v several sounders reported data indicative of a unit of low sensitivity which would mean that there are other rocks at a depth of 200 to 250 m which underlie the ultramafics the depth to that unit varies from approximately 140 m to 250 m in lithological terms unit vi is likely a diabase chert formation below the ultramafics 2 the self potential sp method was applied to better define the capillary flow of groundwater within the zone of the ascending springs the measured sp values ranged from approximately 4 mv to 30 mv although the image of the capillary groundwater flow was largely masked by the water flow towards the bezimeni potok a special contribution of the results was the corroboration that the four springs da near spring bč are not seeps but places of diffuse ascending outflow 3 the mise a la masse method is founded upon the fact that groundwater flow in the zones of fractured and tectonized ultramafics is characterized by a lower resistivity than more compact parts of the same rocks the distribution of the induced potential fields around springs bč and hv suggests that they are connected in the deeper reaches 4 4 neotectonic assessment the neotectonic analysis of a zone somewhat larger than the study area provided elements that were used to first produce a map of the rupture pattern and relief energy on a scale of 1 25 000 and then a map of the first trend of the relief energy for the contemporary tectonic setting in gruda the active neotectonic structures were grouped into two categories based on size and importance fig 5 the first group comprises regional structures of hectokilometer spread which separate large morphostructural units and extend beyond the study area these are complex neotectonic structures close to faults or fault zones the second category is comprised of small local faults reconstructed within the study area which separate larger units into smaller blocks the neotectonic structures extend to different depths within the rock masses the category i structures are assumed to reach under the ultramafics diabase chert formation perhaps go even deeper and the category ii structures do not necessarily reach the ultramafic floor fig 7 4 5 soil investigations the top soil in gruda is largely 10 20 cm thick exceptionally as much as 40 cm fig 4 soil over ultramafics typically contains less clay than other types of soils and features high concentrations of iron chromium nickel and cobalt and low concentrations of nutrients such as nitrogen phosphorus and sodium brooks 1983 in the study area where developed the soil is of the black soil type over serpentinite tanasijević et al 1963 the soil crushes easily and drains well due to a polyhedral structure such that its water retention capacity is low however there are numerous places that are bare with solid rock masses parent rock exposed on the ground surface 4 6 exploratory drilling exploratory borehole ib 10 was drilled to a depth of 30 m some 600 m southeast of spring bč fig 3 it is situated in the tectonic block of kraljeva voda where the ascending springs are located four distinct zones were identified in the borehole core zone i from the ground surface to 0 15 m soil of brown color with numerous pieces of weathered harzburgite in the form of sharp fragments up to 10 cm in size and grass roots zone ii from 0 15 m to 8 40 m heavily cracked harzburgite core in the form of kernels up to 10 cm in size down to 4 60 m harzburgite with numerous fissures 5 8 mm wide unfilled or semi filled with silty material and or 3 5 mm harzburgite fractions and from 4 60 m to 8 40 m unfilled or semi filled fractures zone iii from 8 40 m to 26 45 m harzburgite 23 30 cm long kernels many fissures up to 8 mm wide unfilled rarely semi filled zone iv 26 45 m to 30 m harzburgite kernels up to 58 cm long rare pinched or unfilled fissures 0 1 mm wide monitoring of groundwater levels at observation well ib 10 in 2013 2014 revealed that maximum levels were recorded in march and that the levels dropped gradually from the beginning of june to the beginning of october the observation well was dry and then groundwater levels began to rise again the minimum depth to groundwater on record is 0 64 m 4 7 comparative analysis of precipitation and spring discharge table 1 shows the following parameters determined in the january 2006 march 2007 and january 2013 march 2014 campaigns total precipitation p calculated mean daily air temperature at zlatibor synoptic station calculated average discharges of springs bč and hv qav average water temperature tav and average water alkalinity phav the comparative analysis revealed no effect of precipitation or air temperature on the discharge regimes of springs bč and hv or water temperature 4 8 hydrological observations of the bezimeni potok in the recession period the flow of the bezimeni potok was found to originate solely from spring bč and four springs da that constitute the livada groundwater emergence zone fig 3 spring bč is on the right bank of the bezimeni potok at a distance of about 5 m from the channel of the creek situated 2 1 m above the channel the four springs da are at roughly the same elevation as spring bč but at a distance of 5 to 20 m from the bezimeni potok groundwater emerges from the diffuse springs over a surface area of approximately 5 to 10 m2 the terrain is always wet and the water collects and forms small and weak spurts from which water runs to the bezimeni potok during the course of monitoring the discharge of the bezimeni potok in the recession period from 1 june to 31 october 2013 was recorded at q 2 08 l s if the permanent discharge of spring bč which is constant and amounts to 0 85 l s is deducted from the creek s discharge the amount of 1 23 l s clearly derives from the four springs da in the bezimeni potok valley 4 9 geodetic surveys and piezometric head of ascending springs bč and hv geodetic surveys revealed that the elevation of spring bč is 920 05 m and that of spring hv 918 47 m the piezometric head at spring bč measured 0 49 m above the ground surface and at spring hv 0 58 m the surveys showed that water emerged from spring bč at an elevation 1 58 m higher than at spring hv and that the piezometric head at spring bč was 1 49 m higher than that of spring hv 4 10 water quality of springs bč and hv during both campaigns the water quality of the two springs was found to be stable across all parameters hydrochemical analyses showed that the waters are cold around 11 c and mildly alkaline ph 8 2 8 5 the macrocomponent composition is characterized by hydrocarbonates bč 275 mg l hv 225 mg l magnesium ion bč 55 mg l hv 45 mg l and orthosilicic acid bč 41 mg l as h4sio4 hv 28 mg l as h4sio4 the concentrations of other macrocomponents were much lower in fact extremely low the microelement content of the water from spring bč is shown in table 2 among the trace elements chromium was detected in an elevated concentration 12 86 mg l while the other parameters were below recommended permissible levels according to the eu drinking water directive 2011 the radioactivity of the water was determined by gamma spectrometry and the results showed extremely low activity of cesium potassium radium and uranium isotopes table 3 the results of hydrochemical tests undeniably indicate that the ultramafics are the setting in which groundwater occurs in the fractured aquifer at gruda nikić et al 2013 4 11 3h and 14c isotope analyses table 3 shows the results of tritium isotope 3h and table 3 of carbon isotope 14c activity determinations the values of 4 5 t u at spring bč and 6 6 t u at spring hv indicate that there is a certain age differential between the two waters the values might be a result of mixing of groundwater with meteoric water according to motzer 2007 and tadros et al 2014 the concentrations of tritium in the waters of springs bč and hv classifies them as those resulting from mixing of groundwater and meteoric water slightly more pronounced mixing of groundwater and contemporary meteoric water was noted in the case of spring hv compared to spring bč the difference is as expected given that spring hv is not developed captured and a greater effect of contemporary meteoric water is possible near the ground surface the groundwater age expressed as an apparent 14c age is from 2590 to 3230 years bp before present however this result cannot be deemed absolute rather it is indicative of the average residence time in the aquifer the values also indicate that the water from spring bč is somewhat older than that from spring hv keeping in mind the results of monitoring of the water regimes of the two springs it is reasonable to assume that the waters are not directly affected by contemporary meteoric water a schematic of the aquifer s water balance is shown in fig 6 precipitation p in gruda is distributed among aquifer recharge by diffuse infiltration di surface runoff qp evaporation e

ultramafics are hard relatively stiff rocks with no significant primary porosity bucher and frey 2002 however the ultramafics in the study area have been exposed to endogenous and various exogenic processes during the upper jurassic especially the neogene period as a result there is some secondary porosity of the fracture type in the ultramafics at gruda based on the results of the investigations the secondary fracture porosity of the ultramafics was classified into families depending on the dominant process that created them the following families of fractures in the gruda ultramafics were identified a endogenous activity in the zlatibor ultramafic massif after the upper jurassic is reflected in the formation of several generations of tectonic structures in gruda they extend up to several kilometers and reach different depths neotectonic structures of the first category r were assumed to run downward through the entire ultramafic mass to the point of contact with the diabase chert formation those of the second category need not necessarily extend to the ultramafic floor fig 7 the fractures within the neotectonic structures and those that accompany them are supercapillary 0 25 mm wide au capillary 0 25 0 0001 mm or subcapillary 0 0001 mm their density along the fault structure is not uniform and ranges from non existent to high they are unfilled open semi filled or completely filled with silty material and or fine clastic ultramafic fragments b over the geologic time a weathering crust was formed as a result of exogenic processes in the ultramafics virtually across the entire terrain the porosity closely follows the terrain morphology and the depths are 3 6 m locally about 10 m in addition to the exogenic processes an endogenous component has also contributed to the formation of the weathering crust its role is reflected in a larger fracture porosity of the ultramafics on the ground surface within the zone of neotectonic structures the supercapillary fractures are dominant and occur unfilled semi filled or completely filled with silt and or fine hard clastic material of autochthonous origin on certain locations in gruda the fractures in the ultramafic weathering crust are so numerous that they can be imagined in each point on a decimeter scale in such places these fractures can be classified as penetrative planar fabric turner and weiss 1963 compared to the rest of the ultramafic mass and other genetic types of secondary porosity the physical and hydrogeological characteristics of the weathering crust are distinctly different consequently the ultramafic weathering crust in gruda is believed to be an isotropic and homogeneous penetrative fracture system based on detailed examination the ultramafic weathering crust at gruda was classified as an epi fracture zone analogous to the epikarst zone described by mangin 1975 and perrin et al 2003 in the case of karst terrains it should be noted that epikarst zones in karst and epi fracture zones in ultramafics are not equally permeable the permeability of epikarst zones is much higher but in the present case the permeability of the epi fracture zone in the ultramafics is not negligible the effect of scale in the latter case charmoille et al 2009 is apparent given the results of the investigations and in view of the scale the epi fracture zone at gruda is vertically divided into two sub zones upper and lower fig 7 similar to the epikarst zones described by smart and friedrich 1986 from doefliger et al 1999 the upper sub zone has a penetrative planar fabric with numerous fractures in the decimeter range identified as a sector of fine fracture porosity the depth of this sub zone is generally 2 to 3 m locally 4 m and its thickness varies across the study area in addition to unfilled and semi filled fractures there are those filled with fine clastic or silty material of autochthonous origin products of weathering of the ultramafics compared to the upper sub zone the lower epi fracture sub zone has fewer fractures the supercapillary and capillary fractures are penetrative and in the decimeter meter range the lower sub zone is divided by fractures into blocks of several tens of centimeters in healthy compact ultramafics they intersect are hydraulically connected mostly unfilled and rarely filled with clastic autochthonous material vertically the lower sub zone usually follows the upper epi fracture sub zone and the morphology of the terrain the thickness varies from 3 to 5 m locally more the fracture porosity and thickness vary depending on local morphological conditions the nature of the ultramafics and the tectonics however it should be noted that in the fault zone the lower epi fracture sub zone is somewhat deeper and forms slopes on the left and right sides of the neotectonic structure centerline this results in a horizontally wider and vertically deeper zone of high fracture porosity along the centerline fig 7 c in gruda there is a special family of fractures within a disconformity between the diabase chert formation and the ultramafics the genesis of these fractures is associated with the ultramafics overthrusting the diabase chert formation in the upper jurassic the assumed thickness of this system of fractures is approximately 40 m mojsilović et al 1978 the fracture width ranges from supercapillary ad to capillary they are unfilled to pinched and inclined to nearly subhorizontal the tectonic contact between the ultramafics and the diabase chert formation is extremely important in geological and hydrogeological terms geologically there is a disconformity between two different lithostratigraphic units iugs 2006 which is indicative of the thickness of the gruda ultramafics 250 m as determined by geophysical surveys from a hydrogeological perspective the importance is that there are supercapillary fractures at this contact which are hydraulically connected the diabase chert formation is impermeable and thus constitutes the floor of the fractured aquifer in the ultramafics d a special family of fractures is a result of lithostatic pressure or the weight of the upper parts of the ultramafics as such they are not significant in hydrogeological terms and are deemed to be devoid of groundwater or dry nikić et al 2013 5 2 hydrogeological characteristics of fractures on a macro scale the gruda ultramafics comprise rocks with hydrogeologically no significant porosity on a medium scale m the secondary porosity of the massif gains some importance although not large the secondary fracture porosity allows some permeability and the formation of a fractured aquifer groundwater body however on a micro scale dm cm genetically different secondary fractures are significant from a hydrogeological perspective 5 2 1 hydrogeological characteristics of the epi fracture zone a hydrogeologically specific feature of the epi fracture zone or the ultramafic weathering crust is the presence of numerous fractures of different widths and degrees of filling which are chaotically distributed and hydraulically well connected owing to the extremely well developed fracture porosity of the ultramafics in the epi fracture zone there is diffuse infiltration di of meteoric water water is infiltrated and then flows along supercapillary fractures gravitationally the floor of the epi fracture zone is also ultramafic therefore compact and with no hydrogeologically significant porosity they are thus considered to be impermeable rocks except in places of neotectonic structures during wet periods infiltrated water is stored locally for a limited period of time in a pseudo diffuse aquifer above the impermeable ultramafics the water depth of the locally stored water is relatively small 3 10 m these storage units are unconfined they belong to an open hydrogeological structure and each has its own local continuous water table the distance between such units can be small they may or may not be hydraulically connected or connected only during certain hydrologic events since the units exist only during wet periods and for a short time thereafter they are referred to as seasonal or local reservoirs figs 7 and 8 there are many such reservoirs in gruda but their distribution across the epi fracture zone is not uniform the water from the seasonal reservoirs in the epi fracture zone is lost to evaporation e transpiration tr drainage via intermittent springs and seeps is and downward flow along fractures that follow the neotectonic structures fig 6 the effect of this loss is reflected over time in declining water tables of all the seasonal reservoirs the rate of decline varies among them and depends on weather conditions landscape features hydrogeological conditions stored water quantity and the permeability of fractures along the neotectonic structure the water tables decline gradually continuously and at different rates when the water table of a seasonal reservoir drops below the drainage line of an intermittent spring or seep the groundwater ceases to emerge on the land surface consequently the number of intermittent springs and seeps gradually declines and by the end of spring they all dry out throughout this time the groundwater from a seasonal reservoir also flows towards deeper reaches given that the epi fracture zone can be inclined relative to the neotectonic structure it directs the groundwater flow to the structure like a funnel fig 7 in functional terms this is very important because the neotectonic structure promotes line drainage fig 7 toward the end of the recession period the general water table in the epi fracture zone drops to within the neotectonic structures figs 7 and 8 then all the fractures above the groundwater level are waterless and filled with air fig 8 they thus revert to the aeration zone and the epi fracture zone is ready to receive water in the next wet season figs 7 and 8 this clearly differentiates the zone from the rest of the ultramafics in gruda but also from other genetic types of ultramafic fractures 5 2 2 hydrogeological characteristics of fractures in neotectonic structures in hydrogeological terms the unfilled and hydraulically connected fractures along the neotectonic structures of the first category r become the main pathways of downward groundwater flow figs 7 and 8 the flow velocity along these main pathways is relatively low given that fracture widths au along the neotectonic structures decrease with increasing depth as does their permeability this causes the flow from the seasonal reservoirs to the neotectonic structures to be gradual and continuous owing to that fact no aeration unsaturated zone is formed in the fractured ultramafic aquifer at gruda between the seasonal reservoirs in the epi fracture zone and the groundwater in the neotectonic structures looking at the hydrogeological section the part of the neotectonic structure above the current groundwater level is in the aeration zone and the part below where all the fractures are filled with water is in the saturated zone belongs to an open hydrogeological structure via the epi fracture zone fig 8 the neotectonic structures of the second category in gruda which do not reach the bottom of the ultramafics might be contributing to the hydraulic connection between the neotectonic structures of the first category fig 5 groundwater from the neotectonic structures is lost solely to downward flow figs 6 7 and 8 this flow is relatively slow and the groundwater level is usually the lowest at the end of the recession period however it still remains relatively high and is able to maintain a sufficiently high hydrostatic pressure to feed ascending springs bč hv and da in the kraljeva voda depression and support their artesian pressure figs 6 7 and 8 5 2 3 hydrogeological characteristics of disconformity fractures it is reasonable to assume that apart from nearly vertical fractures in the neotectonic structures of the first category the disconformity also features subcapillary subhorizontal fractures that are a result of the overthrust ultramafics the hydrogeological significance of unfilled supercapillary and subhorizontal fractures in the disconformity is that they allow lateral groundwater flow groundwater flow along the contact occurs due to the hydrostatic pressure in the neotectonic structures of the first category r owing to this hydrostatic pressure and the hydraulic link between two genetically different families of fractures the lateral flow is laminar converges toward the neotectonic structures of the first category and drains the aquifer via the ascending springs figs 7 and 8 however the piezometric head of the ascending springs in the kraljeva voda depression was determined to be approximately 0 5 m above the ground surface owing to the relatively high ground elevations a hydrostatic pressure is formed along the edges of the depression comprised of tectonic blocks divided by neotectonic structures fig 5 this pressure is conducive to groundwater flow the high potential energy in the form of hydrostatic pressure in the neotectonic structures is spent on countering the resistance in the groundwater flow process along the disconformity to the point of outflow figs 7 and 8 the part of the aquifer in the disconformity is a semi confined hydrogeological feature with subartesian and artesian pressures there are probably not many supercapillary fractures in the disconformity ad and the flow velocity is very low according to the isotope analyses of the water from spring bč the apparent age of the groundwater is 3230 20 years and from spring hv 2590 20 years these ages are indicative of slow and deep circulation in the gruda ultramafic rocks within the hydraulically interconnected but genetically different families of fractures the total cross sectional area of supercapillary fractures excluding the epi fracture zone is the largest at the entrance to the neotectonic structures σau au1 au2 aum it is somewhat smaller along the disconformity σad ad1 ad2 adn and the smallest at the exit from the neotectonic structures σai ai1 ai2 aip namely σau σad σai figs 8 and 9 groundwater level fluctuations during the year from maximum to minimum δh hmax hmin have no effect on the piezometric head ho of the ascending springs in the kraljeva voda tectonic depression which remains constant figs 7 8 and 9 6 hydrodynamic model of the gruda ultramafic fracture system the interconnected families of fractures in the gruda ultramafics were identified as a single hydrogeologic fracture system hgfs for the following reasons a the interconnected fracture families of different genetic origin constitute a system of fractures and a hydraulic entity in which the waters within the fractures interact and b each fracture connected to at least one other fracture functions within a single groundwater body or fractured aquifer figs 7 8 and 9 a 3d hydrodynamic model of the hydrogeologic fracture system was developed on the basis of the previously described geologic and hydrogeologic conditions of the gruda ultramafics licensed gw vistas ver 6 rumbaugh j and rumbaugh d 1996 2011 modflow software was used its primary application relates to intergranular and highly stratified aquifers however it is often used as a software tool for assessing fractured aquifers given that no commercial software is available for that type of aquifer as such the approach was challenging in terms of performance expectations and the validity of results 6 1 conceptual approach a large diversity was noted with regard to the spread and hydrogeologic setting of the three studied zones of the fractured aquifer in the gruda ultramafics the epi fracture zone was modeled as a continuous porous medium of a large horizontal and small vertical spread figs 7 8 and 9 locally its upper part exhibits nearly intergranular porosity characteristics the horizontal boundary of this zone was modeled as a single continuous layer and it coincides with the topographic water divide of the catchment of the ascending springs in the kraljeva voda depression fig 10 the upper surface of the epi fracture zone is also the ground surface its morphology is governed by the relief which affects the groundwater flow mechanism namely the investigations revealed that the kraljeva voda depression in which the springs are situated is where the fractured aquifer in the gruda ultramafics is drained fig 9 even though there are ground elevations in the drainage area lower than that of spring hv 918 47 m above sea level there are no ascending springs like in the kraljeva voda depression this fact led to the assumption that in terrains hypsometrically lower than the elevation of spring hv all the neotectonic structures in places of contact with the epi fracture zone are impermeable it is possible that the fractures along the neotectonic structures are pinched or filled analogously there is virtually no aquifer recharge from precipitation in parts of the terrain below the elevation of the ascending springs as such precipitation beyond the topographic water divide does not belong to the studied hydrogeological system which is relevant to the understanding of the groundwater flow mechanism fig 10a however it is possible that a part of the aquifer in the disconformity and the lower parts of some of the neotectonic structures are beyond the orthogonal projections of the topographic water divide of the kraljeva voda depression but there is certainly no hydraulic contact with neighboring aquifers the tectonic blocks were modeled as a single layer but with a water bearing medium only along the subvertical neotectonic structures r and only in parts believed to be unfilled above an elevation of 920 m a large part of this zone is occupied by impermeable ultramafics in the form of massive tectonic blocks modeled as no flow cells they are about 230 m thick although the horizontal spread of the subvertical neotectonic structures coincides with the underlying disconformity the place of the active hydraulic link between the neotectonic structures and the epi fracture zone where the neotectonic structures are at elevations above 920 m is highly relevant to the studied aquifer fig 10b the parts of the neotectonic structures beyond the topographic water divide were modeled as impermeable otherwise there would be a hydraulic link with neighboring aquifers and this would not be consistent with the results and the adopted hydrogeological concept the disconformity was specified in the model as hypsometrically the lowest porous unit or the lowest modeled layer and it represents a continuous permeable unit under the tectonic blocks figs 7 8 and 9 groundwater along it is in hydraulic communication via the subvertical neotectonic structures of the first category r which intersect this zone it was assumed that the disconformity is a layer of roughly the same thickness 40 m fig 4 and that the hypsometric relationships are such that elevations decrease from the fringes to the middle of the entire system the kraljeva voda depression fig 9 the horizontal spread of this part of the fractured aquifer was defined on the basis of the neotectonic analysis of the gruda rupture pattern fig 10c in the hydrodynamic model the bottom of the disconformity represented the boundary condition of the impermeable jurassic diabase chert formation fig 4 6 2 modeling of the porous medium and groundwater flow mechanism in hydrogeological terms three zones were identified in the modeled porous medium along the vertical going downward the epi fracture zone 20 m the neotectonic structures 230 m and the disconformity 40 m figs 8 and 9 the porosity of all three is of the fracture type however since the supercapillary fractures can be filled with solid ultramafic fragments there is fracture porosity in combination with nearly intergranular whose characteristics are specific on a medium or micro scale the privileged trending of the fractures could not be diagnosed so in general terms it was assumed that along the fractures in the study area the dominant porosity has elements of the pseudogranular type according to that assumption the groundwater flow in its entirety was considered to be laminar darcy s flow in an intergranular porous medium fig 8 there is a water table within the epi fracture zone and certain upper parts of the neotectonic structures whereas the lower parts of the aquifer are confined figs 8 and 9 the infiltrated precipitation that is not drained via intermittent springs or seeps or lost to evapotranspiration enters the porous medium along the subvertical neotectonic structures where permeable conditions prevail fig 6 the water moves down to the aquifer through the fractures of the subvertical neotectonic structures up to the zone of saturated neotectonic structures and the disconformity the water flows subhorizontally and very slowly through the disconformity up to the point where it vertically emerges from the porous medium via the ascending springs in the kraljeva voda depression fig 9 this fact required setting of two types of boundary conditions in the hydrodynamic model infiltration of precipitation limited to zones along the neotectonic structures and in the water balance limited to the total outflow of water from the aquifer at a rate of about 2 5 l s specified as water column height in a given time interval with a velocity dimension m s and aquifer drainage via the ascending springs in the kraljeva voda depression specified as piezometric head at the point of discharge dimension m 6 3 calibration of the model the model was calibrated on the basis of the investigation results with certain assumptions and modeling of natural characteristics and groundwater flow conditions the investigations provided reliable information concerning the constant regime of springs bč and hv discharge temperature and water quality model calibration was founded upon the following principles the model was calibrated through calculations for steady flow assuming that aquifer recharge corresponds to drainage over a relatively long period the piezometric head in this regime is consistent with the multiyear average terrain geometry was simulated in accordance with available geohydrogeological knowledge of the study area the relief was simulated with an equidistance of 10 m which maximized accuracy given the discretization of the study area model cells 12 5 m 12 5 m a relatively large jump between neighboring cells at different elevations should be kept in mind fig 10c it caused certain difficulties that the software could not resolve in a satisfactory manner the rectangular matrix that covered the study area was approximately 15 5 km2 monitoring revealed that the rate of discharge of ascending spring bč was q 0 85 l s and of hv q 0 42 l s in addition the continuous cumulative discharge of the four da springs in livada was assumed to be 1 23 l s fig 9 consequently the model was calibrated for an overall water balance of 2 5 l s the springs were specified using surveyed or estimated elevations of groundwater emergence the ground surface whose elevation was below that of the ascending springs 920 m was not relevant to the aquifer regime precipitation does not reach the aquifer and was hydraulically isolated from precipitation in the model fig 10d the active ground surface where precipitation is infiltrated epi fracture zone was defined based on the selected approach to model a quasi steady aquifer regime this ground surface belongs to the unconfined part of the aquifer fig 10d its spread is a result of the overall geometry and flow characteristics of the porous medium as well as the combination of aquifer recharge and drainage figs 8 and 9 infiltration is the only renewable factor of the aquifer it was targeted to correspond to the given discharge and specified in the model as belonging to the unconfined part of the aquifer fig 10e simulation of the geometry of the second and third model layers subvertical neotectonic structures and disconformity was simplified with a vertical second layer and horizontal third layer spread fig 10f and 10 g each tectonic block was defined in plan view by a tectonic discontinuity figs 5 10c and 10d fig 10c and d show two numbers in each tectonic block the first is the elevation of the bottom of the disconformity and the second of the bottom of the tectonic block the sides of the tectonic blocks were assumed to be vertical surfaces which represent tectonic discontinuities and the bottom a horizontal plane fig 11 the epi fracture zone overlies the tectonic blocks it was assumed to be 20 m lower than the real ground relief the model comprises three layers looking down from the ground surface the layers are 1 epi fracture zone 2 tectonic discontinuities and blocks and 3 disconformity a single representative hydraulic conductivity was assumed for the active porous medium because a few aspects of the model due to lack of relevant data are like those of a gray box model the filtration characteristics of the porous medium were the same across the modeled area the reason for this was a lack of measured data preliminary estimation indicated a degree of uncertainty if these characteristics were to be defined for each zone separately so a general hydraulic conductivity was targeted which could meet the previously specified requirements during the calibration process calculations were initially made using assumed input quantities with gradual convergence towards the targeted solution 6 4 results of calculations in view of the fact that commercial software for fractured aquifers is not available modflow was used the calculations were extensive and time consuming the required accuracy was also an issue due to the inability to converge the interim results some 3000 to 5000 iterations were needed to reduce the budgeting error to about 1 despite these difficulties the end result was satisfactory model calibration provided the hydraulic conductivity of the porous medium the rate of infiltration and the size of the ground surface where active infiltration occurs the representative hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer is k 1 10 5 m s this value provided the most realistic picture of groundwater flow the land surface where infiltration of precipitation occurs was estimated fig 10d shows this part of the terrain in white pink is dry land where the piezometric head is below the floor of the epi fracture zone the upper boundary of the wet zone of this part of the aquifer is generally around an elevation of 950 m and locally above 960 m while the minimum elevation is approximately 940 m the surface area of the infiltration aquifer recharge zone was approximated at 5 3 km2 the rate of infiltration was estimated at 4 8 10 10 m s meaning that 15 mm of water reaches the aquifer annually from the recharge zone the multiyear average precipitation in the extended zone of mt zlatibor is 970 mm such that the multiyear average proportion of infiltrated precipitation is 1 7 in the lowest zone of the aquifer at the hydraulic contact of the disconformity and the neotectonic structure point z figs 7 8 and 9 the direction of groundwater flow is along the subvertical neotectonic structure toward the ground surface and the ascending springs in the kraljeva voda depression figs 8 9 and 10f the piezometric head in point z figs 7 8 and 9 is 942 7 m and on the ground surface at spring bč it is 922 05 m the difference of 20 65 m or 2 02 bar is the hydraulic loss along the flow from point z figs 7 8 and 9 to the ascending springs the groundwater pathways from the point of entry into the aquifer to the point of exit are diverse they were simulated in the model by a graphical representation of streamlines calculations based on the particle tracking method a streamline begins at a given point in the epi fracture zone red continues through the subvertical neotectonic structure black and the disconformity green and leaves the aquifer vertically upward at the ascending spring fig 10g the particle residence time depends on the initial location and route fig 10h as shown in fig 10h the modeled groundwater residence times range from approximately 1000 to 4000 years within catchment area depending on the water particle infiltration point direction of movement nature of the fracture system in the epi fracture zone tectonic discontinuities and the disconformity given the real privileged pathways three genetically different families of fractures in the solid ultramafics the modeled ages are considered satisfactory when compared to those determined as apparent according to 14c fig 11a shows a streamline in plan view and fig 11b shows section i i of the hydrodynamic model of the gruda ultramafic hgfs the section is n e and passes through ascending spring bč two arbitrary input points northwest and south of spring bč were selected to depict the streamline the plan view in fig 11a shows only horizontal groundwater flow red and blue lines since the streamline was projected onto section line i i in a part of the section the groundwater blue line passes through impermeable strata i e the ultramafics dark color in section i i the porous permeable strata epi fracture zone tectonic discontinuities disconformity are marked with the same shade of green which reflects the general single hydraulic conductivity of the gruda ultramafic hgfs 7 conclusion in tectonic and lithological terms two structural megastages were identified in the area called gruda mt zlatibor the lower comprises a middle and upper jurassic diabase chert formation and the upper a tectonically shaped upper jurassic ultramafic massif as it overthrust the diabase chert formation the ultramafic massif acquired complex protostructural and then younger tectonic features given that the ultramafics have no significant primary porosity from a hydrogeological perspective only their secondary porosity of the fracture type was relevant with regard to the entire ultramafic mass in gruda the secondary fracture porosity is low based on their genesis the fractures were grouped into three families those caused by exogenic factors by tectonic activity and by the ultramafics overthrusting the diabase chert formation these genetically different families of fractures are hydraulically interlinked and host an aquifer in the form of a single groundwater body identified as a hydrogeologic fracture system hgfs in the gruda ultramafics the results of these activities indicated a highly complex hydrogeological fracture system an unconfined subartesian and artesian aquifer the fractured aquifer is recharged solely by meteoric water gravity and hydrostatic pressure govern groundwater flow along the fractures the groundwater flows under artesian pressure from the upper unconfined reaches of the aquifer to the point of natural drainage in the kraljeva voda depression the fractured aquifer is drained on the ground surface only in the kraljeva voda depression via two ascending springs where the water emerges in the form of a single jet and four diffuse springs the quantitative and qualitative parameters of springs bč and hv are uniform no effect of external climatic meteorological or hydrological factors on the discharge regime and water quality of the fractured aquifer in the gruda ultramafics was noted in real time the fractured hydrogeological system in the ultramafic rocks at gruda is characterized by output quantities in the form of groundwater discharges via ascending springs which do not depend solely on the input quantity of meteoric water they also depend on the geologic history of the system and the manner in which it has changed over time as such the system is a hydrogeological hysteresis of sorts the hydrodynamic model of the hydrogeological fracture system was developed to define the geological and hydrogeological conditions of the gruda ultramafics using modflow software given that there is no commercial software for fractured aquifers such an approach was challenging in terms of performance expectations and realistic results despite these difficulties the resulting hydraulic conductivity of the fractured aquifer k 1 10 5 m s and the rate of recharge 4 8 10 10 m s were satisfactory as was the size of the active precipitation infiltration zone 5 3 km2 the results contributed to a more accurate determination of the recharge zone of the fractured aquifer in gruda based on which groundwater source protection can be zoned on average 1 7 of total precipitation was found to reach the aquifer what is especially important is that the numerical values of the fractured aquifer parameters would be very difficult nearly impossible to express on the basis of conventional hydrogeological investigations the results of the present hydrodynamic study are certainly open to critique still in general the study shed light on and corroborated the assumed hydrogeologic and hydrodynamic setting of the ultramafic fractured aquifer in gruda however the results deemed objective are indicative of the possibility of using the above software for hydrodynamic modeling and tasks that involve hard fracture porosity rocks especially with regard to groundwater source sanitary protection zoning declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

6013,a part of the balkan ultramafic massif is situated in western serbia and belongs to a mountain range with several prominent peaks including mt tara mt zlatibor and mt zlatar the porosity of ultramafic rocks is generally very low such that they are classified as nearly or completely waterless rocks however due to tectonic activity and exogenic processes over geologic time some ultramafic rocks exhibit a certain level of secondary fracture porosity hydraulically interconnected fractures can form aquifers of the fractured type such as the one found in gruda on mt zlatibor on this location the quality parameters of the groundwater in the fractured aquifer drained via a spring called bijela česma prompted detailed multidisciplinary investigations aimed at defining the elements of the aquifer for commercial water bottling purposes given that the investigations were comprehensive the results allowed high quality interpretation of the hydrogeologic conditions and provided the background for developing a hydrodynamic model of the fractured hydrogeologic system in the ultramafic rocks at gruda modflow software was used for modeling this software is primarily intended for intergranular aquifers but no programs are available for fractured aquifers in hard rocks with pronounced discontinuities modeling of the fractured aquifer in the ultramafic rocks at gruda provided the following information size of active infiltration surface hydraulic conductivity of the porous medium rate of recharge residence time of a drop of groundwater from entry to exit graphical representation of streamlines and the like despite these difficulties the results are satisfactory the values of the analyzed parameters are believed to be objective and indicate a certain possibility of using modflow in hydrodynamic modeling and solving hydrogeologic problems that involve hard rocks and fractured porosity in practice this is especially important for sanitary protection zoning of groundwater sources that rely on fractured aquifers keywords ultramafic rocks fractured aquifer hydrogeologic fracture system hydrodynamic model serbia 1 introduction a fractured aquifer is a highly complex hydrogeological system in most cases it is typically found in hard rocks igneous sedimentary or metamorphic of secondary porosity where primary porosity is either subordinate or non existent hydrogeological exploration of fractured aquifers often requires extensive multidisciplinary investigations and consequently substantial funding moreover each of the various exploration methods often contributes to a better understanding of only a segment of the puzzle that is a fractured aquifer rarely shedding light on the entire picture however the pieces of the puzzle put together in a hydrodynamic model offer a range of possibilities and solutions that provide a clearer and more accurate representation of the studied fractured aquifer this would be difficult to accomplish with conventional exploration approaches one hydrogeologically complex and very interesting aquifer of the fractured type is found in ultramafic rocks in an area called gruda on mt zlatibor in western serbia this particular aquifer is especially remarkable because of its recharge and drainage mechanisms and water quality adding to the attraction is the fact that over an area of about 25 km2 built up of jurassic ultramafic rocks there are permanent springs of the ascending type in relative proximity to each other two of them expel a water jet and the discharge of four is diffuse the water quality of the two gushing springs is extremely favorable from a nutritional perspective such that one has been captured for commercial water bottling for that purpose numerous complex and extensive investigations have been conducted a hydrodynamic model was constructed based on the results of investigations of the fractured aquifer in ultramafic rocks at gruda on mt zlatibor the input parameters for the model were the results of geological and hydrogeological investigations undertaken in two campaigns at different times the first in 2004 2006 and the second in 2012 2014 however during the course of analysis and synthesis of the results of the second multidisciplinary exploration campaign 2012 2014 and subsequent integrated assessment of both campaigns certain elements were noted that facilitated geological and hydrogeological interpretation and the development of a hydrodynamic model of the low alkaline fractured aquifer in the ultramafic rocks in gruda this favorable circumstance served as a basis for the present paper one of whose main contributions is showing how to model the hydrodynamics of a complex fractured aquifer in hard rocks specifically ultramafic rocks licensed commercial software gw vistas ver 6 modflow usgs edition available with several commercial interfaces was applied to a fractured aquifer the results of hydrodynamic modeling are indicative of the potential of this program in hydrogeological exploration of fractured porosity rocks this feature is especially valuable given that there are currently no commercial programs for fractured aquifers the results presented in the paper specifically for ultramafic rocks allow for comparison with other examples attempts of hydrodynamic modeling of other types of hard fractured porosity rocks also noteworthy is the fact that the paper revises certain conclusions nikić et al 2013 about the geologic framework of the study area geological age of the sediments in the kraljeva voda depression thickness of the ultramafics above the diabase chert formation and block like build up of the terrain 2 study area the study area is in a spacious ultramafic massif in western serbia west balkans south east europe fig 1 from a geological perspective the territory falls within the alps more specifically within the ophiolitic belt of the dinaric alps tectonic unit of the first order dimitrijević 2002 it is part of the ultramafic massif of the balkan peninsula one of the largest continuous ultramafic formations in europe brooks 1987 the study area is on mt zlatibor which is situated between mt tara in the northwest and mt zlatar in the southeast the surface area of mt zlatibor is about 1100 km2 and its ultramafic massif occupies roughly 1050 km2 hydrographically it belongs to the black sea basin the topographic water divided crosses mt zlatibor and divides the mountain into parts that fall within the catchments of the zapadna morava river to the north and the drina to the west geotectonically the ultramafic massif of mt zlatibor belongs to the central part of the dinaric ophiolitic belt which existed as an oceanic section from the middle triassic to the upper jurassic dimitrijević and dimitrijević 1973 karamata 2006 schmid et al 2008 many researchers have studied the dinaric ophiolitic belt and within it the zlatibor ultramafic massif based on geophysical investigations milovanović and mladenović 1966 67 report that the zlatibor massif originated from magma intrusions along a large fault of dinaric trending ćirić 1966 1967 believes that it evolved from submarine extrusions and emplacement of peridotites over a diabase chert formation mojsilović et al 1978 claim that the massif is a plate like body 1000 1200 thick which overlies the diabase chert formation and that along the fringes the thickness decreases to only several tens of meters vukašinović 1996 reports that tectonic and magmatic activity resulted in a mélange type nature of the diabase chert formation that magma intrusions occurred along deep dislocations and that movement of the sediment and magmatite blocks further complicated the build up of the ophiolites diabase chert formation and ultramafics additionally resulting in cold contacts between the sediments and magmatites according to mojsilović et al 1978 and dimitrijević 1996 mt zlatibor is mostly built up of upper jurassic ultramafics with some middle jurassic diabase cherts and triassic limestones in the northern part of mt zlatibor there is a spacious rolling plateau at elevations ranging from 850 to 1200 m fig 1 in the northeastern part of the plateau in an area called gruda there is a shallow depression named kraljeva voda there are two permanent springs of the ascending type in this depression from which water spurts and four permanent ascending springs of the diffuse type where water emerges over on area of 5 to 10 m2 a land area of some 25 km2 was selected which is bounded to the south by the peaks of lečića vrh 1091 m and tusto brdo 995 m to the north and northeast by peaks that arch from the northwest to the southeast velika gruda 1140 m škodrića priboj 1002 m čavik 1015 m and lađevac 940 m to the west by the kani potok and to the east by peaks from obadovica 981 m in the south to lađevac 940 m in the north figs 1 and 3 the captured spring with the largest discharge is called bijela česma bč the lower discharge spring not captured is hajdučko vrelo hv and the four diffuse ascending springs da are unnamed figs 3 5 and 9 the drainage network in the study area comprises four permanent streams kani potok bijele vode prdavac and bezimeni potok figs 1 and 3 as well as several ephemerals the streams are all ungauged and their general flow regime is pluvial nival after heavy rainfall or sudden snow melt the streams become torrents in the recession period their flow rate is from 0 5 l s to 1 5 l s no sinking of the streams was detected the source of the bijele vode is a karst spring oko os situated at a point of contact between triassic limestones and jurassic ultramafic rocks on the northern fringes of očka gora figs 1 and 3 the bezimeni potok is permanent from the ascending springs in the kraljeva voda depression the prdavac creek originates from a couple of springs whose capacity is less than 0 1 l s and which emerge from the diabase chert formation the catchment of the kani potok is largely beyond the study area its hardly visible permanent flow is formed by leaching waters immediately upstream from its junction with the bijele vode creek the major channels of all the streams are in the parent rocks they are 0 5 m to 1 4 m wide and 0 2 m to 0 5 m deep the study area belongs to the drina river catchment and thus to the danube river basin the study area is sparsely populated and the landscape features spacious mountain pastures and meadows and rare small and isolated white pine groves 3 material and methods the algorithm in fig 2 shows groups of activities undertaken during the two campaigns aimed at defining the elements of the fractured aquifer in ultramafic rocks geological and hydrogeological prospecting carried out in gruda encompassed a land area of around 30 km2 whose central part hosts the above mentioned ascending springs this activity provided basic information on the study area remote detection and photogeological assessment the objective of remote detection was to supplement existing data on the rupture pattern and assess the characteristics of the tectonic structures in the study area satellite imagery was assessed by monocular means and subsequent data interpretation referred to the regional geological framework described in available geological documentation photogeological assessment of the ruptures was undertaken to study the geological framework in more detail and identify tectonic structures geological and hydrogeological mapping on a scale of 1 25 000 covered an area of approximately 25 km2 in both campaigns the most important regional geological information was taken from yugoslav archives state geological map of the former yugoslavia scale 1 100 000 sheet k34 4 titovo užice and accompanying authentic handwritten material on a scale of 1 25 000 geophysical investigations were undertaken in the extended area of springs bč hv and da in the kraljeva voda depression roughly in the middle of the study area the resistivity method was applied for vertical and lateral identification of the lithologic units and to get an indication of the spatial positions of the fractures and aquifers the maximum half distance between the current electrodes c1c2 2max was 600 m which ensured that the investigated depth was approximately 350 m the self potential method was used to detect subsurface flow or in other words to determine if there were any springs masked by proluvial or alluvial sediments the objective of the mise a la masse method was to detect the positions and directions of fractures along which groundwater flows to the ascending springs neotectonic analysis the neotectonic activity in the gruda ultramafic rocks was reconstructed by quantitative geomorphological analysis relief energy was selected as a parameter relevant to the most recent movements of the earth s crust this parameter was processed by morphometric and statistical methods and the results were presented by means of isolines the relief energy was determined by the difference in height within a ground surface unit of 1 km2 statistical processing and reduction to the reference zero level yielded positive and negative relief energy values the first energy relief trend was calculated to eliminate the effect of exogenic processes and emphasize the effect of endogenous processes that lead to neotectonic activity marković 1983 soil testing the focus was on the thickness porosity and permeability of the soil overlying the ultramafic rocks exploratory drilling was undertaken to verify the results of mapping and geophysical and photogeological investigations as well as to gain insight into the nature of the fractures in the study area six boreholes were drilled during the first campaign and one ib 10 in the second up to a depth of 30 m a 3 piezometer casing was installed in the borehole to a depth of 29 90 m climate parameters annual precipitation is a significant meteorological parameter from the viewpoint of the amount of meteoric water that recharges the fractured aquifer in gruda it was also important for determining if there is a correlation between the amount of precipitation and the discharges of springs bč and hv the data were obtained from the synoptic station on mt zlatibor which is closest to the study area 3 8 km northeast observations of discharge rates temperatures and ph of spring water bč and hv were made in both campaigns both springs were observed at the same time at five day intervals the discharge rate of spring bč was monitored by the volumetric method and that of spring hv by a thomson weir hydrological monitoring of the bezimeni potok was conducted in the second campaign a small rectangular concrete dam was installed in the channel at approximately 150 m downstream from spring bč there are no permanent tributaries upstream the topographic catchment area is 0 3 km2 the objective was to determine the discharge of the bezimeni potok creek in the dry period when only groundwater from the ascending springs contributes to the flow geodetic surveys and determination of piezometric head at springs bč and hv were undertaken instrumentally during the second campaign the piezometric head of both springs was determined by installing an inverted funnel on each of the springs the top of the funnel was connected by a plastic tube diameter 2 whose opening was 1 8 m above the ground surface both springs were observed on the same day testing of physical properties and chemical compositions of spring water bč and hv was performed in both campaigns and included physical properties chemical gas microbial and biological compositions chrysotile asbestos concentrations and radioactivity total α β and γ isotope 3h and 14c analyses of spring water bč and hv tritium 3h isotope analyses were performed to check for a connection between groundwater and meteoric water and those of carbon 14c isotopes to determine the age of the groundwater in the second campaign one set of samples were tested in a single series in 2013 the activity of 14c was measured by accelerator mass spectrometry ams and of 3h by a liquid scintillation counter lsc whose lower limit of detection by electrolytic enrichment was 0 06 bq l and 0 5 t u 4 results 4 1 geologic framework of the study area the study area features mesozoic neogene and quaternary rocks the spatial position of the geologic formations is shown in fig 3 and the respective lithologic column in fig 4 mesozoic mesozoic rocks include limestones t3 a diabase chert formation j2 3 harzburgites σej3 3 lherzolites σdlj3 3 serpentinites sej3 3 and serpentinized and opalized harzburgites seop upper triassic limestones are found in the easternmost part of the study area called očka gora in a small tectonically bounded block whose surface area is about 0 9 km2 fig 3 in lithological terms the strata comprise thick stratified to banked limestones limestone dolomites and dolomites mojsilović et al 1978 dimitrijević and dimitrijević 1996 believe that the upper triassic limestones in mt zlatibor were first deposited over the drina ivanjica element in the paleozoic and that they later slid into an ophiolite mélange in the form of olistoplaques this is how a block of upper triassic limestones reached gruda in the study area fig 3 in the middle upper jurassic a diabase chert formation was created in the labile parts of the dinaric geosyncline a thick ultramafic body was formed in the basin over the diabase chert formation in the upper jurassic period along deep dislocations milovanović and mladenović 1966 67 ćirić 1966 67 mojsilović et al 1978 this resulted in the creation of a contact metamorphic belt represented by amphiboles honeycombed striped sillimanite gneisses gneiss micaschists phyllites and green schists however the lithology of most of the study area in gruda is rather uniform represented by upper jurassic ultramafic rocks the primary rocks are differentiates of harzburgite magma and the intensity of serpentinization varies full serpentinization is noted only along the fringes of the massif and in tectonized zones mojsilović et al 1978 the harzburgites are fractured on the ground surface but deeper down there is a fresh looking lithological unit of a massive texture and porphyroclastic structure which is very hard and light to dark green in color lherzolite is found in the northwestern part of the study area it is hard and compact on the ground surface with up to 1 cm wide fractures there are serpentinites in the northeastern and eastern parts of the study area on the ground surface and at small depths there are numerous 1 2 cm wide fractures which are unfilled or semi filled with earth or small fragments of hard rock weathering products in deeper parts the serpentinites are hard and light to dark green serpentinized and opalized harzburgite is found on a very small location between springs bč and hv there area numerous fissures up to 5 mm wide semi filled to unfilled these formations overlie semi serpentinized harzburgites given the uniform lithology of the harzburgites lherzolites and serpentinites in the study area as described above and in view of the topic of this paper the term ultramafics and the adjective ultramafic will be used hereafter neogene the paper by nikić et al from 2013 reported that the sediments in the central part of the study area within the shallow depression called kraljeva voda belong to the quaternary period however the research campaign undertaken in 2014 established that they are in fact miocene figs 3 and 4 the drilled sediments are lithologically represented by alternating layers of clay and angular ultramafic fragments whose size is 1 2 cm the thicknesses of these layers vary up to 0 6 m according to mojsilović et al 1978 these sediments originate from lacustrine and later marsh conditions in tectonic depressions at which time their floor probably sank slowly this mechanism facilitated profundal sedimentation with largely clay sediments alternating with interbeds of harzburgite fragments carried by erosion to the very edge of the depression quaternary the quaternary formations q2 are represented by fluvial and slopewash cycles their spread is not large and their thickness is up to 1 m fig 4 4 2 remote detection and photogeological assessment of the rupture pattern remote detection was primarily used to determine large regional discontinuities certain and inferred ruptures were identified from the photogeological assessment which indicated a relatively extensive rupture pattern in the entire study area 4 3 results of geophysical investigations 1 six geoelectric units were identified by the resistivity method modified for geoelectric sounding fig 4 unit i very low resistivity up to 17 ωm which comprises the lowest parts of the terrain in the kraljeva voda depression the thickness of this unit is approximately 25 m and in lithological terms there are alternating strata of clay and ultramafic fragments unit ii low resistivity from 6 ωm to 45 ωm forming the ground surface in the vicinity of all the probes the thickness is about 5 m and the lithology is represented by extensively fractured ultramafics in the weathering crust unit iii slightly elevated resistivity approximately 90 ωm to 260 ωm in the shallow parts of the terrain between springs bč and hv its thickness is 15 20 m and the lithology is represented by serpentinized and opalized harzburgite with honeycombed opal and a clay component unit iv elevated resistivity approximately 180 ωm to 310 ωm below unit ii the thickness is from 7 m to 13 m and the lithology comprises slightly cracked ultramafics in the weathering core unit v very high resistivity from 3500 ωm to 6200 ωm situated in deep parts of the terrain below unit iv the thickness of this unit is considerable ranging from about 115 m to 210 m and the lithology corresponds to compact ultramafics unit vi high resistivity 240 ωm to 1200 ωm representing the deepest parts of the terrain below unit v several sounders reported data indicative of a unit of low sensitivity which would mean that there are other rocks at a depth of 200 to 250 m which underlie the ultramafics the depth to that unit varies from approximately 140 m to 250 m in lithological terms unit vi is likely a diabase chert formation below the ultramafics 2 the self potential sp method was applied to better define the capillary flow of groundwater within the zone of the ascending springs the measured sp values ranged from approximately 4 mv to 30 mv although the image of the capillary groundwater flow was largely masked by the water flow towards the bezimeni potok a special contribution of the results was the corroboration that the four springs da near spring bč are not seeps but places of diffuse ascending outflow 3 the mise a la masse method is founded upon the fact that groundwater flow in the zones of fractured and tectonized ultramafics is characterized by a lower resistivity than more compact parts of the same rocks the distribution of the induced potential fields around springs bč and hv suggests that they are connected in the deeper reaches 4 4 neotectonic assessment the neotectonic analysis of a zone somewhat larger than the study area provided elements that were used to first produce a map of the rupture pattern and relief energy on a scale of 1 25 000 and then a map of the first trend of the relief energy for the contemporary tectonic setting in gruda the active neotectonic structures were grouped into two categories based on size and importance fig 5 the first group comprises regional structures of hectokilometer spread which separate large morphostructural units and extend beyond the study area these are complex neotectonic structures close to faults or fault zones the second category is comprised of small local faults reconstructed within the study area which separate larger units into smaller blocks the neotectonic structures extend to different depths within the rock masses the category i structures are assumed to reach under the ultramafics diabase chert formation perhaps go even deeper and the category ii structures do not necessarily reach the ultramafic floor fig 7 4 5 soil investigations the top soil in gruda is largely 10 20 cm thick exceptionally as much as 40 cm fig 4 soil over ultramafics typically contains less clay than other types of soils and features high concentrations of iron chromium nickel and cobalt and low concentrations of nutrients such as nitrogen phosphorus and sodium brooks 1983 in the study area where developed the soil is of the black soil type over serpentinite tanasijević et al 1963 the soil crushes easily and drains well due to a polyhedral structure such that its water retention capacity is low however there are numerous places that are bare with solid rock masses parent rock exposed on the ground surface 4 6 exploratory drilling exploratory borehole ib 10 was drilled to a depth of 30 m some 600 m southeast of spring bč fig 3 it is situated in the tectonic block of kraljeva voda where the ascending springs are located four distinct zones were identified in the borehole core zone i from the ground surface to 0 15 m soil of brown color with numerous pieces of weathered harzburgite in the form of sharp fragments up to 10 cm in size and grass roots zone ii from 0 15 m to 8 40 m heavily cracked harzburgite core in the form of kernels up to 10 cm in size down to 4 60 m harzburgite with numerous fissures 5 8 mm wide unfilled or semi filled with silty material and or 3 5 mm harzburgite fractions and from 4 60 m to 8 40 m unfilled or semi filled fractures zone iii from 8 40 m to 26 45 m harzburgite 23 30 cm long kernels many fissures up to 8 mm wide unfilled rarely semi filled zone iv 26 45 m to 30 m harzburgite kernels up to 58 cm long rare pinched or unfilled fissures 0 1 mm wide monitoring of groundwater levels at observation well ib 10 in 2013 2014 revealed that maximum levels were recorded in march and that the levels dropped gradually from the beginning of june to the beginning of october the observation well was dry and then groundwater levels began to rise again the minimum depth to groundwater on record is 0 64

precipitation p calculated mean daily air temperature at zlatibor synoptic station calculated average discharges of springs bč and hv qav average water temperature tav and average water alkalinity phav the comparative analysis revealed no effect of precipitation or air temperature on the discharge regimes of springs bč and hv or water temperature 4 8 hydrological observations of the bezimeni potok in the recession period the flow of the bezimeni potok was found to originate solely from spring bč and four springs da that constitute the livada groundwater emergence zone fig 3 spring bč is on the right bank of the bezimeni potok at a distance of about 5 m from the channel of the creek situated 2 1 m above the channel the four springs da are at roughly the same elevation as spring bč but at a distance of 5 to 20 m from the bezimeni potok groundwater emerges from the diffuse springs over a surface area of approximately 5 to 10 m2 the terrain is always wet and the water collects and forms small and weak spurts from which water runs to the bezimeni potok during the course of monitoring the discharge of the bezimeni potok in the recession period from 1 june to 31 october 2013 was recorded at q 2 08 l s if the permanent discharge of spring bč which is constant and amounts to 0 85 l s is deducted from the creek s discharge the amount of 1 23 l s clearly derives from the four springs da in the bezimeni potok valley 4 9 geodetic surveys and piezometric head of ascending springs bč and hv geodetic surveys revealed that the elevation of spring bč is 920 05 m and that of spring hv 918 47 m the piezometric head at spring bč measured 0 49 m above the ground surface and at spring hv 0 58 m the surveys showed that water emerged from spring bč at an elevation 1 58 m higher than at spring hv and that the piezometric head at spring bč was 1 49 m higher than that of spring hv 4 10 water quality of springs bč and hv during both campaigns the water quality of the two springs was found to be stable across all parameters hydrochemical analyses showed that the waters are cold around 11 c and mildly alkaline ph 8 2 8 5 the macrocomponent composition is characterized by hydrocarbonates bč 275 mg l hv 225 mg l magnesium ion bč 55 mg l hv 45 mg l and orthosilicic acid bč 41 mg l as h4sio4 hv 28 mg l as h4sio4 the concentrations of other macrocomponents were much lower in fact extremely low the microelement content of the water from spring bč is shown in table 2 among the trace elements chromium was detected in an elevated concentration 12 86 mg l while the other parameters were below recommended permissible levels according to the eu drinking water directive 2011 the radioactivity of the water was determined by gamma spectrometry and the results showed extremely low activity of cesium potassium radium and uranium isotopes table 3 the results of hydrochemical tests undeniably indicate that the ultramafics are the setting in which groundwater occurs in the fractured aquifer at gruda nikić et al 2013 4 11 3h and 14c isotope analyses table 3 shows the results of tritium isotope 3h and table 3 of carbon isotope 14c activity determinations the values of 4 5 t u at spring bč and 6 6 t u at spring hv indicate that there is a certain age differential between the two waters the values might be a result of mixing of groundwater with meteoric water according to motzer 2007 and tadros et al 2014 the concentrations of tritium in the waters of springs bč and hv classifies them as those resulting from mixing of groundwater and meteoric water slightly more pronounced mixing of groundwater and contemporary meteoric water was noted in the case of spring hv compared to spring bč the difference is as expected given that spring hv is not developed captured and a greater effect of contemporary meteoric water is possible near the ground surface the groundwater age expressed as an apparent 14c age is from 2590 to 3230 years bp before present however this result cannot be deemed absolute rather it is indicative of the average residence time in the aquifer the values also indicate that the water from spring bč is somewhat older than that from spring hv keeping in mind the results of monitoring of the water regimes of the two springs it is reasonable to assume that the waters are not directly affected by contemporary meteoric

ultramafics are hard relatively stiff rocks with no significant primary porosity bucher and frey 2002 however the ultramafics in the study area have been exposed to endogenous and various exogenic processes during the upper jurassic especially the neogene period as a result there is some secondary porosity of the fracture type in the ultramafics at gruda based on the results of the investigations the secondary fracture porosity of the ultramafics was classified into families depending on the dominant process that created them the following families of fractures in the gruda ultramafics were identified a endogenous activity in the zlatibor ultramafic massif after the upper jurassic is reflected in the formation of several generations of tectonic structures in gruda they extend up to several kilometers and reach different depths neotectonic structures of the first category r were assumed to run downward through the entire ultramafic mass to the point of contact with the diabase chert formation those of the second category need not necessarily extend to the ultramafic floor fig 7 the fractures within the neotectonic structures and those that accompany them are supercapillary 0 25 mm wide au capillary 0 25 0 0001 mm or subcapillary 0 0001 mm their density along the fault structure is not uniform and ranges from non existent to high they are unfilled open semi filled or completely filled with silty material and or fine clastic ultramafic fragments b over the geologic time a weathering crust was formed as a result of exogenic processes in the ultramafics virtually across the entire terrain the porosity closely follows the terrain morphology and the depths are 3 6 m locally about 10 m in addition to the exogenic processes an endogenous component has also contributed to the formation of the weathering crust its role is reflected in a larger fracture porosity of the ultramafics on the ground surface within the zone of neotectonic structures the supercapillary fractures are dominant and occur unfilled semi filled or completely filled with silt and or fine hard clastic material of autochthonous origin on certain locations in gruda the fractures in the ultramafic weathering crust are so numerous that they can be imagined in each point on a decimeter scale in such places these fractures can be classified as penetrative planar fabric turner and weiss 1963 compared to the rest of the ultramafic mass and other genetic types of secondary porosity the physical and hydrogeological characteristics of the weathering crust are distinctly different consequently the ultramafic weathering crust in gruda is believed to be an isotropic and homogeneous penetrative fracture system based on detailed examination the ultramafic weathering crust at gruda was classified as an epi fracture zone analogous to the epikarst zone described by mangin 1975 and perrin et al 2003 in the case of karst terrains it should be noted that epikarst zones in karst and epi fracture zones in ultramafics are not equally permeable the permeability of epikarst zones is much higher but in the present case the permeability of the epi fracture zone in the ultramafics is not negligible the effect of scale in the latter case charmoille et al 2009 is apparent given the results of the investigations and in view of the scale the epi fracture zone at gruda is vertically divided into two sub zones upper and lower fig 7 similar to the epikarst zones described by smart and friedrich 1986 from doefliger et al 1999 the upper sub zone has a penetrative planar fabric with numerous fractures in the decimeter range identified as a sector of fine fracture porosity the depth of this sub zone is generally 2 to 3 m locally 4 m and its thickness varies across the study area in addition to unfilled and semi filled fractures there are those filled with fine clastic or silty material of autochthonous origin products of weathering of the ultramafics compared to the upper sub zone the lower epi fracture sub zone has fewer fractures the supercapillary and capillary fractures are penetrative and in the decimeter meter range the lower sub zone is divided by fractures into blocks of several tens of centimeters in healthy compact ultramafics they intersect are hydraulically connected mostly unfilled and rarely filled with clastic autochthonous material vertically the lower sub zone usually follows the upper epi fracture sub zone and the morphology of the terrain the thickness varies from 3 to 5 m locally more the fracture porosity and thickness vary depending on local morphological conditions the nature of the ultramafics and the tectonics however it should be noted that in the fault zone the lower epi fracture sub zone is somewhat deeper and forms slopes on the left and right sides of the neotectonic structure centerline this results in a horizontally wider and vertically deeper zone of high fracture porosity along the centerline fig 7 c in gruda there is a special family of fractures within a disconformity between the diabase chert formation and the ultramafics the genesis of these fractures is associated with the ultramafics overthrusting the diabase chert formation in the upper jurassic the assumed thickness of this system of fractures is approximately 40 m mojsilović et al 1978 the fracture width ranges from supercapillary ad to capillary they are unfilled to pinched and inclined to nearly subhorizontal the tectonic contact between the ultramafics and the diabase chert formation is extremely important in geological and hydrogeological terms geologically there is a disconformity between two different lithostratigraphic units iugs 2006 which is indicative of the thickness of the gruda ultramafics 250 m as determined by geophysical surveys from a hydrogeological perspective the importance is that there are supercapillary fractures at this contact which are hydraulically connected the diabase chert formation is impermeable and thus constitutes the floor of the fractured aquifer in the ultramafics d a special family of fractures is a result of lithostatic pressure or the weight of the upper parts of the ultramafics as such they are not significant in hydrogeological terms and are deemed to be devoid of groundwater or dry nikić et al 2013 5 2 hydrogeological characteristics of fractures on a macro scale the gruda ultramafics comprise rocks with hydrogeologically no significant porosity on a medium scale m the secondary porosity of the massif gains some importance although not large the secondary fracture porosity allows some permeability and the formation of a fractured aquifer groundwater body however on a micro scale dm cm genetically different secondary fractures are significant from a hydrogeological perspective 5 2 1 hydrogeological characteristics of the epi fracture zone a hydrogeologically specific feature of the epi fracture zone or the ultramafic weathering crust is the presence of numerous fractures of different widths and degrees of filling which are chaotically distributed and hydraulically well connected owing to the extremely well developed fracture porosity of the ultramafics in the epi fracture zone there is diffuse infiltration di of meteoric water water is infiltrated and then flows along supercapillary fractures gravitationally the floor of the epi fracture zone is also ultramafic therefore compact and with no hydrogeologically significant porosity they are thus considered to be impermeable rocks except in places of neotectonic structures during wet periods infiltrated water is stored locally for a limited period of time in a pseudo diffuse aquifer above the impermeable ultramafics the water depth of the locally stored water is relatively small 3 10 m these storage units are unconfined they belong to an open hydrogeological structure and each has its own local continuous water table the distance between such units can be small they may or may not be hydraulically connected or connected only during certain hydrologic events since the units exist only during wet periods and for a short time thereafter they are referred to as seasonal or local reservoirs figs 7 and 8 there are many such reservoirs in gruda but their distribution across the epi fracture zone is not uniform the water from the seasonal reservoirs in the epi fracture zone is lost to evaporation e transpiration tr drainage via intermittent springs and seeps is and downward flow along fractures that follow the neotectonic structures fig 6 the effect of this loss is reflected over time in declining water tables of all the seasonal reservoirs the rate of decline varies among them and depends on weather conditions landscape features hydrogeological conditions stored water quantity and the permeability of fractures along the neotectonic structure the water tables decline gradually continuously and at different rates when the water table of a seasonal reservoir drops below the drainage line of an intermittent spring or seep the groundwater ceases to emerge on the land surface consequently the number of intermittent springs and seeps gradually declines and by the end of spring they all dry out throughout this time the groundwater from a seasonal reservoir also flows towards deeper reaches given that the epi fracture zone can be inclined relative to the neotectonic structure it directs the groundwater flow to the structure like a funnel fig 7 in functional terms this is very important because the neotectonic structure promotes line drainage fig 7 toward the end of the recession period the general water table in the epi fracture zone drops to within the neotectonic structures figs 7 and 8 then all the fractures above the groundwater level are waterless and filled with air fig 8 they thus revert to the aeration zone and the epi fracture zone is ready to receive water in the next wet season figs 7 and 8 this clearly differentiates the zone from the rest of the ultramafics in gruda but also from other genetic types of ultramafic fractures 5 2 2 hydrogeological characteristics of fractures in neotectonic structures in hydrogeological terms the unfilled and hydraulically connected fractures along the neotectonic structures of the first category r become the main pathways of downward groundwater flow figs 7 and 8 the flow velocity along these main pathways is relatively low given that fracture widths au along the neotectonic structures decrease with increasing depth as does their permeability this causes the flow from the seasonal reservoirs to the neotectonic structures to be gradual and continuous owing to that fact no aeration unsaturated zone is formed in the fractured ultramafic aquifer at gruda between the seasonal reservoirs in the epi fracture zone and the groundwater in the neotectonic structures looking at the hydrogeological section the part of the neotectonic structure above the current groundwater level is in the aeration zone and the part below where all the fractures are filled with water is in the saturated zone belongs to an open hydrogeological structure via the epi fracture zone fig 8 the neotectonic structures of the second category in gruda which do not reach the bottom of the ultramafics might be contributing to the hydraulic connection between the neotectonic structures of the first category fig 5 groundwater from the neotectonic structures is lost solely to downward flow figs 6 7 and 8 this flow is relatively slow and the groundwater level is usually the lowest at the end of the recession period however it still remains relatively high and is able to maintain a sufficiently high hydrostatic pressure to feed ascending springs bč hv and da in the kraljeva voda depression and support their artesian pressure figs 6 7 and 8 5 2 3 hydrogeological characteristics of disconformity fractures it is reasonable to assume that apart from nearly vertical fractures in the neotectonic structures of the first category the disconformity also features subcapillary subhorizontal fractures that are a result of the overthrust ultramafics the hydrogeological significance of unfilled supercapillary and subhorizontal fractures in the disconformity is that they allow lateral groundwater flow groundwater flow along the contact occurs due to the hydrostatic pressure in the neotectonic structures of the first category r owing to this hydrostatic pressure and the hydraulic link between two genetically different families of fractures the lateral flow is laminar converges toward the neotectonic structures of the first category and drains the aquifer via the ascending springs figs 7 and 8 however the piezometric head of the ascending springs in the kraljeva voda depression was determined to be approximately 0 5 m above the ground surface owing to the relatively high ground elevations a hydrostatic pressure is formed along the edges of the depression comprised of tectonic blocks divided by neotectonic structures fig 5 this pressure is conducive to groundwater flow the high potential energy in the form of hydrostatic pressure in the neotectonic structures is spent on countering the resistance in the groundwater flow process along the disconformity to the point of outflow figs 7 and 8 the part of the aquifer in the disconformity is a semi confined hydrogeological feature with subartesian and artesian pressures there are probably not many supercapillary fractures in the disconformity ad and the flow velocity is very low according to the isotope analyses of the water from spring bč the apparent age of the groundwater is 3230 20 years and from spring hv 2590 20 years these ages are indicative of slow and deep circulation in the gruda ultramafic rocks within the hydraulically interconnected but genetically different families of fractures the total cross sectional area of supercapillary fractures excluding the epi fracture zone is the largest at the entrance to the neotectonic structures σau au1 au2 aum it is somewhat smaller along the disconformity σad ad1 ad2 adn and the smallest at the exit from the neotectonic structures σai ai1 ai2 aip namely σau σad σai figs 8 and 9 groundwater level fluctuations during the year from maximum to minimum δh hmax hmin have no effect on the piezometric head ho of the ascending springs in the kraljeva voda tectonic depression which remains constant figs 7 8 and 9 6 hydrodynamic model of the gruda ultramafic fracture system the interconnected families of fractures in the gruda ultramafics were identified as a single hydrogeologic fracture system hgfs for the following reasons a the interconnected fracture families of different genetic origin constitute a system of fractures and a hydraulic entity in which the waters within the fractures interact and b each fracture connected to at least one other fracture functions within a single groundwater body or fractured aquifer figs 7 8 and 9 a 3d hydrodynamic model of the hydrogeologic fracture system was developed on the basis of the previously described geologic and hydrogeologic conditions of the gruda ultramafics licensed gw vistas ver 6 rumbaugh j and rumbaugh d 1996 2011 modflow software was used its primary application relates to intergranular and highly stratified aquifers however it is often used as a software tool for assessing fractured aquifers given that no commercial software is available for that type of aquifer as such the approach was challenging in terms of performance expectations and the validity of results 6 1 conceptual approach a large diversity was noted with regard to the spread and hydrogeologic setting of the three studied zones of the fractured aquifer in the gruda ultramafics the epi fracture zone was modeled as a continuous porous medium of a large horizontal and small vertical spread figs 7 8 and 9 locally its upper part exhibits nearly intergranular porosity characteristics the horizontal boundary of this zone was modeled as a single continuous layer and it coincides with the topographic water divide of the catchment of the ascending springs in the kraljeva voda depression fig 10 the upper surface of the epi fracture zone is also the ground surface its morphology is governed by the relief which affects the groundwater flow mechanism namely the investigations revealed that the kraljeva voda depression in which the springs are situated is where the fractured aquifer in the gruda ultramafics is drained fig 9 even though there are ground elevations in the drainage area lower than that of spring hv 918 47 m above sea level there are no ascending springs like in the kraljeva voda depression this fact led to the assumption that in terrains hypsometrically lower than the elevation of spring hv all the neotectonic structures in places of contact with the epi fracture zone are impermeable it is possible that the fractures along the neotectonic structures are pinched or filled analogously there is virtually no aquifer recharge from precipitation in parts of the terrain below the elevation of the ascending springs as such precipitation beyond the topographic water divide does not belong to the studied hydrogeological system which is relevant to the understanding of the groundwater flow mechanism fig 10a however it is possible that a part of the aquifer in the disconformity and the lower parts of some of the neotectonic structures are beyond the orthogonal projections of the topographic water divide of the kraljeva voda depression but there is certainly no hydraulic contact with neighboring aquifers the tectonic blocks were modeled as a single layer but with a water bearing medium only along the subvertical neotectonic structures r and only in parts believed to be unfilled above an elevation of 920 m a large part of this zone is occupied by impermeable ultramafics in the form of massive tectonic blocks modeled as no flow cells they are about 230 m thick although the horizontal spread of the subvertical neotectonic structures coincides with the underlying disconformity the place of the active hydraulic link between the neotectonic structures and the epi fracture zone where the neotectonic structures are at elevations above 920 m is highly relevant to the studied aquifer fig 10b the parts of the neotectonic structures beyond the topographic water divide were modeled as impermeable otherwise there would be a hydraulic link with neighboring aquifers and this would not be consistent with the results and the adopted hydrogeological concept the disconformity was specified in the model as hypsometrically the lowest porous unit or the lowest modeled layer and it represents a continuous permeable unit under the tectonic blocks figs 7 8 and 9 groundwater along it is in hydraulic communication via the subvertical neotectonic structures of the first category r which intersect this zone it was assumed that the disconformity is a layer of roughly the same thickness 40 m fig 4 and that the hypsometric relationships are such that elevations decrease from the fringes to the middle of the entire system the kraljeva voda depression fig 9 the horizontal spread of this part of the fractured aquifer was defined on the basis of the neotectonic analysis of the gruda rupture pattern fig 10c in the hydrodynamic model the bottom of the disconformity represented the boundary condition of the impermeable jurassic diabase chert formation fig 4 6 2 modeling of the porous medium and groundwater flow mechanism in hydrogeological terms three zones were identified in the modeled porous medium along the vertical going downward the epi fracture zone 20 m the neotectonic structures 230 m and the disconformity 40 m figs 8 and 9 the porosity of all three is of the fracture type however since the supercapillary fractures can be filled with solid ultramafic fragments there is fracture porosity in combination with nearly intergranular whose characteristics are specific on a medium or micro scale the privileged trending of the fractures could not be diagnosed so in general terms it was assumed that along the fractures in the study area the dominant porosity has elements of the pseudogranular type according to that assumption the groundwater flow in its entirety was considered to be laminar darcy s flow in an intergranular porous medium fig 8 there is a water table within the epi fracture zone and certain upper parts of the neotectonic structures whereas the lower parts of the aquifer are confined figs 8 and 9 the infiltrated precipitation that is not drained via intermittent springs or seeps or lost to evapotranspiration enters the porous medium along the subvertical neotectonic structures where permeable conditions prevail fig 6 the water moves down to the aquifer through the fractures of the subvertical neotectonic structures up to the zone of saturated neotectonic structures and the disconformity the water flows subhorizontally and very slowly through the disconformity up to the point where it vertically emerges from the porous medium via the ascending springs in the kraljeva voda depression fig 9 this fact required setting of two types of boundary conditions in the hydrodynamic model infiltration of precipitation limited to zones along the neotectonic structures and in the water balance limited to the total outflow of water from the aquifer at a rate of about 2 5 l s specified as water column height in a given time interval with a velocity dimension m s and aquifer drainage via the ascending springs in the kraljeva voda depression specified as piezometric head at the point of discharge dimension m 6 3 calibration of the model the model was calibrated on the basis of the investigation results with certain assumptions and modeling of natural characteristics and groundwater flow conditions the investigations provided reliable information concerning the constant regime of springs bč and hv discharge temperature and water quality model calibration was founded upon the following principles the model was calibrated through calculations for steady flow assuming that aquifer recharge corresponds to drainage over a relatively long period the piezometric head in this regime is consistent with the multiyear average terrain geometry was simulated in accordance with available geohydrogeological knowledge of the study area the relief was simulated with an equidistance of 10 m which maximized accuracy given the discretization of the study area model cells 12 5 m 12 5 m a relatively large jump between neighboring cells at different elevations should be kept in mind fig 10c it caused certain difficulties that the software could not resolve in a satisfactory manner the rectangular matrix that covered the study area was approximately 15 5 km2 monitoring revealed that the rate of discharge of ascending spring bč was q 0 85 l s and of hv q 0 42 l s in addition the continuous cumulative discharge of the four da springs in livada was assumed to be 1 23 l s fig 9 consequently the model was calibrated for an overall water balance of 2 5 l s the springs were specified using surveyed or estimated elevations of groundwater emergence the ground surface whose elevation was below that of the ascending springs 920 m was not relevant to the aquifer regime precipitation does not reach the aquifer and was hydraulically isolated from precipitation in the model fig 10d the active ground surface where precipitation is infiltrated epi fracture zone was defined based on the selected approach to model a quasi steady aquifer regime this ground surface belongs to the unconfined part of the aquifer fig 10d its spread is a result of the overall geometry and flow characteristics of the porous medium as well as the combination of aquifer recharge and drainage figs 8 and 9 infiltration is the only renewable factor of the aquifer it was targeted to correspond to the given discharge and specified in the model as belonging to the unconfined part of the aquifer fig 10e simulation of the geometry of the second and third model layers subvertical neotectonic structures and disconformity was simplified with a vertical second layer and horizontal third layer spread fig 10f and 10 g each tectonic block was defined in plan view by a tectonic discontinuity figs 5 10c and 10d fig 10c and d show two numbers in each tectonic block the first is the elevation of the bottom of the disconformity and the second of the bottom of the tectonic block the sides of the tectonic blocks were assumed to be vertical surfaces which represent tectonic discontinuities and the bottom a horizontal plane fig 11 the epi fracture zone overlies the tectonic blocks it was assumed to be 20 m lower than the real ground relief the model comprises three layers looking down from the ground surface the layers are 1 epi fracture zone 2 tectonic discontinuities and blocks and 3 disconformity a single representative hydraulic conductivity was assumed for the active porous medium because a few aspects of the model due to lack of relevant data are like those of a gray box model the filtration characteristics of the porous medium were the same across the modeled area the reason for this was a lack of measured data preliminary estimation indicated a degree of uncertainty if these characteristics were to be defined for each zone separately so a general hydraulic conductivity was targeted which could meet the previously specified requirements during the calibration process calculations were initially made using assumed input quantities with gradual convergence towards the targeted solution 6 4 results of calculations in view of the fact that commercial software for fractured aquifers is not available modflow was used the calculations were extensive and time consuming the required accuracy was also an issue due to the inability to converge the interim results some 3000 to 5000 iterations were needed to reduce the budgeting error to about 1 despite these difficulties the end result was satisfactory model calibration provided the hydraulic conductivity of the porous medium the rate of infiltration and the size of the ground surface where active infiltration occurs the representative hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer is k 1 10 5 m s this value provided the most realistic picture of groundwater flow the land surface where infiltration of precipitation occurs was estimated fig 10d shows this part of the terrain in white pink is dry land where the piezometric head is below the floor of the epi fracture zone the upper boundary of the wet zone of this part of the aquifer is generally around an elevation of 950 m and locally above 960 m while the minimum elevation is approximately 940 m the surface area of the infiltration aquifer recharge zone was approximated at 5 3 km2 the rate of infiltration was estimated at 4 8 10 10 m s meaning that 15 mm of water reaches the aquifer annually from the recharge zone the multiyear average precipitation in the extended zone of mt zlatibor is 970 mm such that the multiyear average proportion of infiltrated precipitation is 1 7 in the lowest zone of the aquifer at the hydraulic contact of the disconformity and the neotectonic structure point z figs 7 8 and 9 the direction of groundwater flow is along the subvertical neotectonic structure toward the ground surface and the ascending springs in the kraljeva voda depression figs 8 9 and 10f the piezometric head in point z figs 7 8 and 9 is 942 7 m and on the ground surface at spring bč it is 922 05 m the difference of 20 65 m or 2 02 bar is the hydraulic loss along the flow from point z figs 7 8 and 9 to the ascending springs the groundwater pathways from the point of entry into the aquifer to the point of exit are diverse they were simulated in the model by a graphical representation of streamlines calculations based on the particle tracking method a streamline begins at a given point in the epi fracture zone red continues through the subvertical neotectonic structure black and the disconformity green and leaves the aquifer vertically upward at the ascending spring fig 10g the particle residence time depends on the initial location and route fig 10h as shown in fig 10h the modeled groundwater residence times range from approximately 1000 to 4000 years within catchment area depending on the water particle infiltration point direction of movement nature of the fracture system in the epi fracture zone tectonic discontinuities and the disconformity given the real privileged pathways three genetically different families of fractures in the solid ultramafics the modeled ages are considered satisfactory when compared to those determined as apparent according to 14c fig 11a shows a streamline in plan view and fig 11b shows section i i of the hydrodynamic model of the gruda ultramafic hgfs the section is n e and passes through ascending spring bč two arbitrary input points northwest and south of spring bč were selected to depict the streamline the plan view in fig 11a shows only horizontal groundwater flow red and blue lines since the streamline was projected onto section line i i in a part of the section the groundwater blue line passes through impermeable strata i e the ultramafics dark color in section i i the porous permeable strata epi fracture zone tectonic discontinuities disconformity are marked with the same shade of green which reflects the general single hydraulic conductivity of the gruda ultramafic hgfs 7 conclusion in tectonic and lithological terms two structural megastages were identified in the area called gruda mt zlatibor the lower comprises a middle and upper jurassic diabase chert formation and the upper a tectonically shaped upper jurassic ultramafic massif as it overthrust the diabase chert formation the ultramafic massif acquired complex protostructural and then younger tectonic features given that the ultramafics have no significant primary porosity from a hydrogeological perspective only their secondary porosity of the fracture type was relevant with regard to the entire ultramafic mass in gruda the secondary fracture porosity is low based on their genesis the fractures were grouped into three families those caused by exogenic factors by tectonic activity and by the ultramafics overthrusting the diabase chert formation these genetically different families of fractures are hydraulically interlinked and host an aquifer in the form of a single groundwater body identified as a hydrogeologic fracture system hgfs in the gruda ultramafics the results of these activities indicated a highly complex hydrogeological fracture system an unconfined subartesian and artesian aquifer the fractured aquifer is recharged solely by meteoric water gravity and hydrostatic pressure govern groundwater flow along the fractures the groundwater flows under artesian pressure from the upper unconfined reaches of the aquifer to the point of natural drainage in the kraljeva voda depression the fractured aquifer is drained on the ground surface only in the kraljeva voda depression via two ascending springs where the water emerges in the form of a single jet and four diffuse springs the quantitative and qualitative parameters of springs bč and hv are uniform no effect of external climatic meteorological or hydrological factors on the discharge regime and water quality of the fractured aquifer in the gruda ultramafics was noted in real time the fractured hydrogeological system in the ultramafic rocks at gruda is characterized by output quantities in the form of groundwater discharges via ascending springs which do not depend solely on the input quantity of meteoric water they also depend on the geologic history of the system and the manner in which it has changed over time as such the system is a hydrogeological hysteresis of sorts the hydrodynamic model of the hydrogeological fracture system was developed to define the geological and hydrogeological conditions of the gruda ultramafics using modflow software given that there is no commercial software for fractured aquifers such an approach was challenging in terms of performance expectations and realistic results despite these difficulties the resulting hydraulic conductivity of the fractured aquifer k 1 10 5 m s and the rate of recharge 4 8 10 10 m s were satisfactory as was the size of the active precipitation infiltration zone 5 3 km2 the results contributed to a more accurate determination of the recharge zone of the fractured aquifer in gruda based on which groundwater source protection can be zoned on average 1 7 of total precipitation was found to reach the aquifer what is especially important is that the numerical values of the fractured aquifer parameters would be very difficult nearly impossible to express on the basis of conventional hydrogeological investigations the results of the present hydrodynamic study are certainly open to critique still in general the study shed light on and corroborated the assumed hydrogeologic and hydrodynamic setting of the ultramafic fractured aquifer in gruda however the results deemed objective are indicative of the possibility of using the above software for hydrodynamic modeling and tasks that involve hard fracture porosity rocks especially with

6014,deep submarine groundwater discharge dsgd is a ubiquitous and highly significant phenomenon yet it remains poorly understood this work proposes a simple theoretical basis for steady state dsgd from a confined aquifer the simple theory is tested against numerical modeling feflow of a case study of dsgd offshore northern israel eastern mediterranean sea modeling further investigates the hydrogeological setting that enables dsgd and the parameters that affect it conductivity of the confining unit head on land seawater salinity and seawater temperature the main findings are thus steady state dsgd eminates far offshore from a confined aquifer exposed by a submarine canyon even under moderate heads it is driven by a thermohaline circulation cell that forms around an intrinsic transition zone between salty cold seawater and fresh warm terrestrial groundwater the circulation is driven by tilted isopycnals and consists of seawater entering the confined aquifer at the exposed section offshore mixing with terrestrial groundwater within the aquifer and seeping back out to the sea as saline warm water the circulation mode and the character of the dsgd depend on the conductivity of the confining unit and on the hydraulic head the seepage velocity is linearly related to the temperature and salinity gradients that develop in the confined aquifer during the thermohaline circulation these new insights have potentially important implications for coastal hydrology seawater chemistry biogeochemistry and submarine slope instability keywords coastal hydrogeology deep submarine groundwater discharge confined coastal aquifers thermo haline groundwater circulations 1 introduction submarine groundwater discharge sgd is a well known phenomenon in the coastal environment and a significant factor in the water budget of coastal aquifers burnett et al 2001 moore 1999 moosdorf and oehler 2017 post 2005 werner et al 2013 it is also important for biogeochemical processes in the marine environment and affects marine ecosystems in terms of nutrient supply johannes 1980 michael et al 2017 moore 2010 and submarine slope instability breen and orange 1992 orange et al 1994 2002 the importance of sgd led to increasingly widespread exploration via measurements burnett et al 2006 2001 cable et al 1996 lambert and burnett 2003 moore 1996 swarzenski et al 2006 and modeling bokuniewicz 1992 cooper 1959 croucher and o sullivan 1995 glover 1959 henry 1959 huyakorn et al 1987 mcbride and pfannkuch 1975 smith 2004 smith and zawadzki 2003 most of the above mentioned studies focused on shallow unconfined coastal aquifers discharging to the sea close to the shore although sgd often also occurs from confined and semi confined aquifers at sites located much further offshore bratton 2010 categorized sgd according to its distance from the shore see fig 4 there nearshore scale 10 m offshore embayment scale 10 km and shelf scale sgd occurring at the edge of the shelf 10 km from shore the last two scales are less studied and described such deep sgd are the focus of this study and will be termed hereafter dsgd one of the fundamental questions regarding dsgd relates to the driving force for the phenomenon wilson 2005 used numerical modeling to show that geothermal heat flux can be an important factor for vast seawater recirculation in the shelf break area her results obtained from a shelf scale model of an unconfined aquifer suggest a full separation between two mechanisms of sgd 1 convection of pure seawater through the aquifer driven by geothermal temperature gradients causing seepage of recirculated seawater through the shelf far offshore 100 km and 2 density driven circulation and dispersive mixing along the fresh salt water transition zone hereafter abbreviated fstz that invokes coastal freshwater brackish sgd as explained by cooper 1959 the two types of sgd cause two spatially separated circulation cells that are simultaneously active in unconfined coastal aquifers and produce two widely different seepage locations and salinities thermally driven dsgd comprising pure seawater and salinity gradient driven fresh or brackish coastal sgd however pure seawater dsgd is clearly not the whole story since mounting evidence suggests that brackish fresh dsgd is both prevalent and significant post et al 2013 groundwater reserves with salinity lower than seawater were observed at different locations off the east coast of the u s with offshore distances ranging from 30 km to 130 km cohen et al 2010 gustafson et al 2019 hathaway et al 1979 johnston 1983 manheim 1967 person et al 2003 robb 1984 thomas et al 2019 off the west coast of the u s there are also places where seepage or the underground presence of brackish saline water are evident essaid 1990 orange et al 2002 in taiwan fresh water seepage offshore the pingtung coastal zone is evident too about 30 km offshore at water depth of 1200 mbsl lin et al 2010 the suggested mechanisms for the above mentioned occurrences of low salinity waters in deep areas offshore include sediment compaction breen and orange 1992 monoclines in a dipping subsea aquifer gustafson et al 2019 and entrapped remnants of past lower sea level essaid 1990 kooi and groen 2001 robb 1984 in taiwan the mechanism for such deep freshwater seepage is not discussed lin et al 2010 a common thread linking these previous observational studies are their suggestions that special transient conditions drive the observed dsgd namely past changes in sea level or sediment compaction the reason that the simpler explanation of steady state dsgd driven by elevated head on land was not invoked in those cases is that previously typical freshwater heads on land were calculated to be insufficient to drive direct steady state groundwater flow all the way from land to the shelf e g cohen et al 2010 person et al 2003 robb 1984 however these calculations commonly assume a no flow boundary between the aquifer and the sea e g kooi and groen 2001 while an assumption of an open boundary condition for the aquifer would yield a completely different result post et al 2013 point that both types of dsgd transient and steady state are ubiquitous around the world and suggest that although in some places it is possible for present day conditions to drive fresh meteoric water to deep areas e g johnston 1983 kooi and groen 2001 vast meteoric groundwater reservoirs vmgr in deep sea may be remnants of past conditions of lower stand of the sea e g essaid 1990 hathaway et al 1979 they explain the transient mechanism as follows sea level rise causes the terrestrial hydrologic system to be pushed landwards and the underground system responds to this abrupt change at rates that are orders of magnitude lower than the rate of sea level rise this retardation dictates the entrapment of fossil water under the new interglacial post sea level rise continental shelf this transient mechanism is widely considered as the most plausible explanation for observations of brackish or fresh groundwater at the shelf scale either in the form of active seeps or as stagnant reservoirs as another example several studies have sought to connect the presence of fresh groundwater in distal areas offshore the eastern coast of the us mainly in the new england area cohen et al 2010 hathaway et al 1979 meisler et al 1984 person et al 2003 robb 1984 to confined submarine aquifers that outcrop far offshore cohen et al 2010 person et al 2003 robb 1984 recently thomas et al 2019 contested the idea that the offshore freshwater orginates from confined aquifers they simulated the landward retreat of a freshwater wedge that extended 100 km off the new jersey shore at the last glacial maxima their model showed that the fresh groundwater wedge does not represent a present day connection between the land meteoric recharge area and the offshore suggesting that fresh groundwater occurrence far offshore the eastern coast of the us represents transient conditions yet steady state conditions are likely sufficient to maintain fresh water offshore at least in some situations one example was revealed by johnston 1983 who reported fresh water occurrence far offshore 88 km fernandina beach between florida and georgia usa the freshwater tongue is not related to past low sea level but is related to present day conditions and may represent the present steady state although it was also suggested there that the fresh water tongue is currently migrating landwards due to recent pumping several studies have attempted to model steady state dsgd of brackish fresh water through a submarine confined aquifer e g amir et al 2013 bakker 2006 kooi and groen 2001 werner and robinson 2018 typically such modeling studies assume idealized conditions of the aquifer e g horizontal geometry infinite confinement on land and more one common and important assumption is that the contact between the aquifer and the sea is a no flow boundary and seepage is allowed only as upward leakage from the aquifer through the confining layer bakker 2006 kooi and groen 2001 werner and robinson 2018 in contrast amir et al 2013 modeled a confined coastal aquifer offshore palmahim area in central israel and suggested the exposure of the confined aquifer about 25 km offshore as a hypothetical hydrogeological setting this exposure together with an assumed strong confinement 6 orders of magnitude difference in hydraulic conductivity between the aquifer and the overlying confining units produced steady state dsgd of fresh water in their model a different configuration which also produced steady state dsgd is provided by michael et al 2016 who showed that hypothetic permeability heterogeneities within a coastal aquifer produce dsgd far a few tens of kilometers and up to a 100 km offshore with the extent depending on horizontal continuity of the heterogeneities despite extensive research on dsgd many questions remain open under what conditions does dsgd of brackish fresh water arise at steady state present day conditions may terrestrial groundwater systems be connected to the deep sea and if yes how what is the hydrological mechanism driving this dsgd and what controls the circulation mode and the seepage characteristics what is the source of the seeping water this work investigates exactly these basic questions concentrating on unraveling one mechanism producing steady state dsgd that of seepage from a confined aquifer that is exposed far offshore first a theoretical background is provided explaining the mechanism driving circulation in confined submarine aquifers and the relation to dsgd then using a case study offshore north israel eastern mediterranean sea as a basis for a hydrogeological modeling study dsgd is simulated from a confined aquifer with flexural structure exposed in the deep areas at the edge of the continental shelf last the possibility of dsgd through a confined coastal aquifer that is exposed offshore is discussed and analyzed it will be shown below that even under moderate heads on land very intense dsgd occurs with no special conditions the engine for this dsgd is the tilting of isopycnals due to the density difference between cold salty seawater on one side and warmer brackish groundwater on the other this tilting of isopycnals between the two boundaries induces a convection cell within the aquifer and intense seepage of brackish water comprising mostly recirculated seawater as dsgd 2 study area as a case study for a hydrological system of a subsea confined aquifer the area offshore northern israel is used fig 1 paldor et al 2019 extensively analyzed and validated the hydrogeological setting in the area and it will only be briefly presented here offshore the achziv submarine canyon asc carves into the continental shelf and narrows it to approximately 2 km width the shelf morphology in the area is characterized by submarine canyons almagor 1993 but the asc is the most developed canyon in the region and the one that reaches closest to the shore it is also the only canyon that is oriented nw se while the others are shore perpendicular e w onshore the mountainous western galilee area rises up to 1200 m above the mean sea level msl starting around 3 km from the shoreline where the coastal plain ends the judea group jg comprises late cretaceous carbonates that are mostly well karstified and are exposed over most of the western galilee area sneh 2004 given its vast exposure areas and its karstic nature the jg aquifer is a major reservoir in the western galilee hydrologic system and holds about 90 of the total 60 mcm yr million cubic meters per year recharge there kessler and kafri 2008 according to the geological analysis presented by paldor et al 2019 the jg aquifer onshore offshore structure presents a unique hydrogeological setting in which the aquifer has a flexural structure in the shallow shelf and at the hinge of the anticline the achziv submarine canyon exposes it to the sea fig 2 this flexural structure of the cretaceous units was also suggested in several other studies from the eastern mediterranean offshore bakalowicz et al 2008 schattner et al 2006 and was shown to extend northwards at least through lebanon elias 2006 3 methods to analyze and discuss mechanisms for dsgd from submarine confined aquifer we use two main tools a numercial hydrological model presented in this section and a simple theoretical model for the relationship between seepage velocity vsgd and salinity temperature gradients in the system presented in section 4 below 3 1 groundwater model a numerical groundwater model is constructed based on an actual case study which was extensively discussed and validated by paldor et al 2019 and was briefly presented above in section 2 the groundwater model is used to analyze the effect of different scenarios of aquifer confinement and driving head i e different hydraulic conductivity of confining units denoted kc and different hydraulic head values on land on seepage on the position of the fstz and on circulation a baseline scenario is then used for a sensitivity analysis that compares between the results of the theoretical calculations presented in section 4 below and the numerical model the sensitivity analysis tests the model response to changes in seawater salinity and temperature using the following model outputs seepage velocity salinity and temperature out of these three outputs the seepage velocity vsgd is compared to the predicted vsgd from the theory the model was constructed to mimic the structure of the jg aquifer and its exposure offshore by the submarine canyon see fig 2 for the canyon location as presented in fig 3 two rock units are considered a highly conductive unit confined by an aquitard where the base of the aquifer is considered impermeable the aquifer exposure offshore requires exchanging the no flow boundary condition that was used in most previous models of submarine confined aquifers e g bakker 2006 kooi and groen 2001 with a constant seawater head boundary condition at the exposed site as shown in fig 3 the major faults that were mapped in the area by bronshtein and sagy 2018 are not included in the model as they are further into the sea than the aquifer exposure in the canyon area it is expected that the faults will amplify the dsgd discussed in this work as they probably serve as hydraulic barriers with low longitudinal hydraulic conductivity hence the exclusion of the faults from the model is a conservative approach 3 2 numerical implementation the hydrologic model was calculated using the finite element flow modeling software feflow diersch 2014 version 7 0 the model solves for the coupled head and salinity evolution the governing equation for diffusion of hydraulic head h is solved neglecting dynamics of the unsaturated zone and assuming no sources sinks 1 h t 1 ρ s s ρ q here s s q are the specific storage and the darcy flux respectively see table 1 for units the mass transport equation was solved in feflow in its convective advective form equation 1 47a in diersch 2014 assuming no sources or sinks 2 s t d s q ϕ s d is the hydrodynamic dispersion tensor which incorporates molecular diffusion and mechanical dispersion here q and ϕ are the darcy flux and porosity respectively the heat transport equation is also solved in feflow in its convective advective form 3 t t 1 c λ t ρ f c f q t in which c i is the specific heat capacity of substance i fluid or solid λ is the tensor of effective thermal conductivity combined thermal conductivity of the fluid and solid and c ϕ ρ f c f 1 ϕ ρ s c s the coupling between the solute and heat transport equations and the fluid flow equation is obtained through a linear equation of state for the water where the density is written as a function of temperature t in c and salinity s g kg 4 ρ ρ 0 1 α t β s here ρ 0 is a reference density typically the lowest in the system freshwater density α is the thermal expansion coefficient of water 1 c and β is the solutal expansion coefficient of water sometimes called salinity contraction with units kg g density variations were considered only for buoyancy related terms i e boussinesq approximation was applied time step length was automatically calculated with feflow s predictor corrector tool using second order scheme forward adams bashforth backward trapezoid rule with a restriction on time step length of 3 days maximum this restriction optimizes computation time while maintaining numerical stability the finite element scheme used was the galerkin fem no upwinding fig 3 depicts the geometry and boundary conditions bc of the model triangular mesh elements were selected with side length ranging between 20 and 50 m 3 3 boundary conditions the right and left hand sides of the model were treated as boundaries of no flow mass or heat flux the base of the aquifer was also set as a no flow boundary and no mass flux but basal heat flux of 45 mw m2 was applied there land surface was a boundary of constant temperature 23 c corresponding to the measured temperature at the groundwater level in the study area paldor et al phd hebrew university of jerusalem 2019 a constant freshwater head and concentration was introduced through the aquifer terrestrial exposure area fig 3 the seafloor was maintained at fixed seawater head and salinity salinity was changed between simulations within the range of 30 39 g l corresponding to the observed global range of ocean salinities hosoda et al 2009 seafloor temperature decreased exponentially with depth as t seafloor z a b e z c this equation is the best fit for the measured temperature depth profile at the area of study paldor et al phd hebrew university of jerusalem 2019 the parameters a b and c are changed to ensure consistency between the seafloor temperature bc and the land surface one so that at the shoreline z 0 t 23 i e a b 23 for all simulations the parameter a dictates the temperature to which the seafloor decays with depth which for the baseline simulation was 14 thus b was 9 to test the effects of seafloor temperature on the circulation a was changed between 12 and 21 c and accordingly b ranged between 11 and 2 the parameter c was used to alter the shape of the temperature depth curve so that it qualitatively fits the observed rate of decay with depth between the maximal seafloor temperature and the minimal paldor et al phd hebrew university of jerusalem 2019 the range of this parameter was 80 c 150 head on the seafloor varied with depth according to the water density ratio δ ρ seawater ρ freshwater ρ freshwater as h seafloor z z δ i e head increases linearly with depth δ was determined according to the seawater density which depended on maximal salinity and minimal temperature through a linear equation of state eq 4 above the most important bc that we impose is constant seawater head at the location where the aquifer is exposed on the shelf this is in contrast to many models of submarine confined aquifers that use a no flow bc at the location where the confined aquifer meets the sea e g bakker 2006 kooi and groen 2001 a no flow bc would have effectively hindered dsgd and circulation see fig 3 for a summary of the bc s applied the aim of this work is to study steady state seepage and hence it would have seemed reasonable to run the model for steady state conditions i e solve eqs 1 3 with zero on the left hand sides however steady state simulations often do not converge huyakorn et al 1987 therefore the simulations were run using the full evolution eqs 1 3 until steady state was reached for seepage velocity salinity and temperature in order to assess the likelihood of natural steady state in the aquifer and the aquitard one may calculate the response time as follows 5 τ s s l 2 k where τ is the response time s s is the specific storage l is a characteristic length of the hydrogeologic unit aquifer or aquitard and k is its hydraulic conductivity for the aquifer the characteristic length l should be taken as the horizontal length of the aquifer because the general flow direction in it is land to sea for the aquitard which generally transports water vertically l should be the aquitard thickness using the values of the simulated aquifer and aquitard table 1 in eq 5 the response time is approximately 4 years for the aquifer and 10 years for the aquitard for an aquitard conductivity of 10 2 m d compared to processes that may alter the hydrogeological conditions e g sea level rise sedimentation precipitation decrease etc the response time is nearly immediate and hence steady state seems highly likely for the modeled hydrological system it should be noted that the conductivity of the confining unit aquitard in the natural system might be lower than the simulated values although the values used here are verified both by dafny et al 2010 and by paldor et al 2019 if so then the response time for the aquitard is longer than 10 years potentially by orders of magnitude which might mean that the flow in the aquitard is not in steady state however this work is focused on the circulation within the confined aquifer itself and hence the steady state of the natural system is likely to examine the effect of aquifer confinement the hydraulic conductivity of the confining units k c was changed in the range 0 01 4 m d three levels of confinement were tested highly confined k c 0 01 m d poorly confined k c 4 m d and intermediate confinement k c 0 07 m d high confinement means that the aquifer is effectively sealed by a very low conductivity unit while poorly confined is an aquifer close to phreatic these values are in the range of the hydraulic conductivities of the geologic layers overlying the judea group in the study area as calibrated by dafny et al 2010 and validated by paldor et al 2019 then the intermediate confinement was used as the baseline simulation for the sensitivity test which was carried out varying three model bcs 1 the temperature of the seawater 2 seawater salinity and 3 head on land fig 3 3 4 values of parameters used in the simulations and the measured outputs for the baseline simulation the conductivity in the aquifer was taken as 40 m d which is suitable for fine sand and for karstic limestones freeze and cherry 1979 this value was adopted following the validation presented by paldor et al 2019 the head applied on land was 30 m which is on the lower side of the values observed in the research area kafri and kessler 2001 the reason why we used the lower bound of head is to ensure that we are on the conservative side and emphasize the fact that the suggested mechanism for dsgd does not require high heads on land higher values will only enhance the mechanism presented here as shown by the sensitivity analysis longitudinal and transverse dispersivities were taken as 30 m and 3 m respectively table 1 these values were found to be high enough to maintain a low peclet number and ensure numerical stability voss and souza 1987 but still within the physically acceptable range for the scale of our problem gelhar et al 1992 the quantities measured from the simulations are 1 seepage velocity vsgd in table 2 2 seepage salinity ssgd 3 seepage temperature tsgd 4 total 2d flux of water through dsgd out of the aquifer qsgd in table 2 vsgd ssgd and tsgd were measured at the point in the outcrop in which the velocity towards the sea was highest usually 2 3 nodes away from the seafloor itself the seafloor obviously is not appropriate for these measurements because the bc s are applied there another measured result is the simulated relative contribution of the seawater circulation to the dsgd called psc percent seawater circulation this follows smith 2004 who calculated the psc as the ratio between seawater and fresh water components of sgd here psc is calculated as 6 psc q swi q fwi where q swi is the volume of seawater entering the aquifer through the outcrop offshore table 2 and q fwi is the volume of water recharging on land into the aquifer hence psc in this work virtually measures the circulation intensity as it indicates how effectively seawater is being sucked into the aquifer relative to the freshwater input this suction of seawater dictates the intensity of the circulation and according to the theoretical calculations presented below it is expected to be linearly proportional to horizontal density gradients that develop in the aquifer when the seawater suction and circulation are very low the major component of the aquifer water input is the freshwater recharge on land and psc is close to zero 4 theory the physics of density driven groundwater circulation when the isopycnals iso density lines in the aquifer are tilted a horizontal hydrostatic pressure gradient may develop depending on the geometry of the aquifer this is easily seen for a theoretical rectangular fully confined aquifer in which one side is held at a constant density ρ 1 and the other is held at a different density ρ 2 ρ 1 δ ρ and a transition zone separates between the two fluids fig 4 consider two points at the bottom of the aquifer situated a distance δ x apart both within the wedge of higher density fluid as in fig 4 a difference in hydrostatic pressure between the 2 points arises due to the difference in the weight of fluid columns situated above them δ p δ x tan θ δ ρ g hence the horizontal hydraulic pressure gradient is p x δ ρ g tan θ in the configuration of fig 4 where δ ρ 0 this pressure gradient is negative and thus initiates flow within the wedge of heavier fluid towards the right conservation of mass dictates the counter flow of lighter fluid from above to the left i e a circulation is initiated as discussed in phillips 2009 equation 4 3 p 128 the rotation vector of this circulation cell denoted ω the vorticity measures the circulation intensity and equals the curl of the flow velocity and hence has dimensions of 1 t 7 ω u according to darcy s law the flow velocity depends on the pressure gradient it can easily be shown from vector calculus that the curl of the velocity is a vector with all zero components the curl of a gradient is zero except for the y component which depends on the horizontal buoyancy gradient 8 ω κ ν b x y where κ is the permeability in units of m2 ν is the kinematic viscosity in m2 s b is the buoyancy force per unit mass in m s2 defined as b g ρ 0 ρ ρ 0 ρ 0 is a reference density typically the lowest in the system i e the freshwater density adopting a linear equation of state see eq 4 above the buoyancy force driving the circulation is given by 9 b g α t β s for two dimensional circulation where the x axis is horizontal and z axis is vertical y is also horizontal perpendicular to x see fig 4 the rotation vector is 10 ω k α t x k β s x y where k is the hydraulic conductivity the rotation vector is a vector pointing in the y direction eq 8 which means that the flow is rotational only in x z plane the schematic diagram in fig 4 presents a setting in which the temperature increases in the x direction i e the first term in the right hand side of eq 10 is negative and the salinity decreases in this direction i e the second term is also negative this means that ω points in the negative y direction implying counter clockwise rotation seawater enters the aquifer below the warm freshwater wedge rotates upwards and left and flows back to the sea as shown in fig 4 by solid black curve with arrows the schematic situation in fig 4 directly applies to the well known henry problem henry 1959 which describes an ideally confined i e confining units have an hydraulic conductivity of zero rectangular aquifer in which fresh water enters on one end and the other boundary is maintained at a constant seawater salinity indeed it has been shown that the henry problem results in a steady state configuration with inclined isopycnals i e an inclined seawater freshwater transition zone see e g fig 7 in abarca et al 2007 as discussed above inclined isopycnals are predicted by eq 8 to drive circulation previous experiments and simulations of the henry problem indeed show seepage from the top salty boundary e g fig 10 of karasaki et al 2006 in reality and in the research presented here aquifers are not ideal they are not fully confined horizontal or rectangular as in the ideal henry problem but instead have more realistic structure and confining conductivity confining units are semi pervious this should not change the basic physics but may modify the magnitude of ω after calculating the rotation vector of the velocity the representative flow velocity may be inferred for the circulation the scaling between the rotation vector ω with units 1 s and the representative flow velocity u with units m s requires some length scale phillips 2009 relates between the circulation intensity the magnitude of the rotation vector and the representative flow velocity via aquifer thickness denoted h for rigid body rotation the magnitudes of the curl of the flow ω and the angular velocity ω are related via ω 2 ω the linear velocity is related to the angular velocity through the radius of curvature which in this case may be approximated by half the aquifer thickness h 2 hence it is suggested that 1 4 of the aquifer thickness might be more appropriate for scaling between the rotation vector and the representative flow velocity at least for certain settings 11 u ω r ω 2 h 2 ω h 4 finally translating the average circulation velocity u to seepage velocity vsgd requires an amplification factor because the seepage occurs through a narrow aperture between the top of the fstz and the top of the aquifer and is thus amplified significantly compared to the average circulation velocity in all the model realizations conducted in this work this amplification factor was in the range of 5 10 therefore based on eqs 10 and 11 the seepage velocity can be approximated as 12 v sgd a k h α t x β s x with a being a prefactor predicted to be roughly in the range of 5 4 to 10 4 according to eq 12 in case of dsgd from a confined aquifer that arises from thermo haline circulations the seepage velocity vsgd is expected to increase linearly with temperature and salinity gradients driving the circulation the intensity of the circulation is also expected to increase linearly with the temperature and salinity gradients eq 10 in what follows these theoretical relationships will be examined in light of the results of the numerical model 5 results we ran 15 simulations while varying conductivity of the confining layer k c salinity of seawater temperature of the sea and hydraulic head on land the runs and their parameters are summarized in table s1 in the supporting material run 1 is considered our baseline simulation since it has 1 the head level on land that is presently documented 2 the calibrated aquifer conductivity 3 the conductivity of confining unit that is most likely in the study area and 4 the present day water temperatures and salinities see dafny et al 2010 kafri and fleischer 2003 kafri and kessler 2001 paldor et al 2019 5 1 baseline simulation result steady state dsgd and associated circulation fig 5 shows the salinity distribution and flow vectors for the baseline simulation this simulation produced a steady state dsgd of brackish water ssgd was about 98 seawater salinity seepage velocity was intense vsgd 0 1 m d seepage temperature was tsgd 16 1 c in fig 5 the point at which vsgd ssgd and tsgd are measured for the baseline simulation is marked with a white dot this point is located 20 m from the seafloor boundary see section 3 4 for details once the system reaches a steady state configuration it is found that this state is a dynamic steady state where the fstz is pushed far offshore compared to phreatic aquifers its position is constant in time but there is a vigorous circulation cell seawater enters at the lower part of the aquifer as seen in fig 5 flows towards the toe of the ftsz which spans 5 km as seen in fig 5 upwells within the aquifer according to the streamline shown in fig 5 reaches the ftsz and then turns back to flow towards the ocean as shown by the white streamline in the circulation cell of fig 5 this is the cell drawn schematically as a cartoon in fig 4 it takes about 500 years in the baseline simulation before a drop of seawater that entered at the bottom of the jg exposure seeps out again at its top 5 2 three basic modes of circulation this section studies the effect of varying aquitard conductivity and freshwater head on the behavior of the modeled hydrological system we present first the effect of confinement on circulation and then present the effect of head results are summarized in table 2 5 2 1 end member 1 highly confined aquifer produces freshwater seepage when the aquifer is highly confined i e very low k c even low realistic heads applied on land are sufficient to drive fresh terrestrial groundwater all the way from the recharge area on land to the dsgd site in the canyon fig 6 a this is enabled by the aquifer exposure offshore which allows discharge seepage in this case is very intense 0 6 m d table 2 and with very low salinity 75 seawater salinity was measured close to the seawater boundary white dot in fig 5 but salinity decayed to less than 15 rapidly over 100 m away from the boundary the psc see eq 6 was high for this simulation 0 7 because salinity gradients near the outcrop were increased as the freshwater wedge reached far offshore in the confined aquifer these increased gradients increase the suction of seawater into the aquifer due to density differences as explained in section 4 and the seawater component of the aquifer circulation is 40 however fig 6a shows that the seawater seeps out below the freshwater so near the top of the outcrop the seepage is fresh and it becomes saltier going down along the outcrop this scenario resembles the typical near shore circulation as portrayed by cooper 1959 and it can be seen as a hydrogeological shoreline that is pushed seawards in the confined aquifer from the actual shoreline in this simulation the majority of the water that is recharged into the aquifer either as freshwater or as sucked seawater is discharged as dsgd through the submarine outcrop of the aquifer qsgd was 26 8 m d2 which is 71 of q swi q fwi 15 3 22 2 m d2 table 2 the remaining 29 leave the system as leaks through the confining unit these leaks are not plotted due to negligible velocities 5 2 2 end member 2 poorly confined aquifer produces two circulation cells when the conductivity of the confining unit is close to that of the aquifer the system behaves like the wilson 2005 model full separation between the geothermal circulation in deep areas and salt dispersion and saline sgd at the near shore scale fig 6b in this simulation seepage velocity was very low vsgd 0 04 m d table 2 qsgd was low too 4 9 m2 d and comprised purely seawater ssgd 100 seawater salinity as expected the seepage through the aquifer outcrop in the submarine canyon qsgd represents a very small component of the total recharge into the aquifer qswi qfwi q sgd q swi q fwi 4 9 107 13 6 0 04 only 4 of the water that entered the aquifer discharged out of it as dsgd the vast majority of the discharge was coastal sgd in addition the close outlet to the sea that was enabled with the high conductivity of the overlying aquitard the shoreline dictated that for the same head on land enormous volumes of freshwater recharged into the aquifer on land 107 m2 d table 2 the psc was the lowest measured in all simulations 0 1 meaning that the sucked seawater is 10 of the freshwater recharged on land in this case psc has a different meaning it was devised to quantify water sources within a single circulation cell but here due to the separate circulation cells psc tells us that the thermal seawater circulation cell which is independent of the fw circulation cell is also 10 times weaker 5 2 3 intermediate case produces a single thermohaline circulation cell as seen in fig 6c the intermediate confinement causes the two mechanisms to converge dsgd is brackish and not 100 seawater salinity yet fresh water originated on land does not reach the seepage site instead it percolates upwards up to about 6 kms offshore the streamlines show that the seawater geothermal circulation merges with the circulation due to salt dispersion within the confined aquifer seepage in this simulation was vsgd 0 1 m d and although no streamline indicated flow of meteoric water all the way to the seepage site the seepage salinity was ssgd 95 thus the intermediate confinement produced brackish dsgd that arises due to thermo haline circulation in the confined aquifer according to the theory equations 7 12 suggest that in this mode of circulation that is driven both by temperature gradients and by salinity gradients the seepage velocity will be proportional to the horizontal temperature and salinity gradients that initiate the circulation section 5 3 below presents the results of the sensitivity analysis aimed to test this theoretical prediction 5 2 4 head effects similar to the effect of confinement changing the freshwater head on land can shift the system between the 3 different modes using our baseline simulation we changed the head between 20 30 and 40 m table 2 above and table s1 in the si fig s1 in the si shows the resulting circulation patterns high head fig s1a produces freshwater seepage as in the case of fig 6a above low head fig s1b produces pure seawater dsgd driven by geothermal convection same as fig 6b and the intermediate head fig s1c is the same simulation as the baseline presented above fig 6c above elevating the head to 40 m resulted in a fourfold increase in the seepage velocity compared to baseline simulation vsgd 0 4 m d and seepage was also less saline ssgd 83 table 2 lowering the head to 20 m caused the seepage velocity to decrease to 0 07 m d but it is seepage of pure seawater ssgd 100 table 2 5 3 sensitivity analysis using the baseline 1 simulation as a representative case for dsgd that is driven by thermo haline circulation a sensitivity analysis is carried out to test two factors of the hydrologic system applied as boundary conditions see section 3 3 for details 1 seawater salinity 2 seawater temperature a third factor the basal heat flux was also tested and showed negligible effect on the system and was thus excluded from this study the sensitivity analysis is meant to test the fit between the model results and the theory presented in section 4 eq 12 predicts that increasing the salinity and temperature gradients where the circulation is initiated will increase the seepage velocity vsgd and the correlation is expected to be linear fig 7 plots measured maximum seepage velocity from 11 different simulations whose conditions are given in table s1 in the supporting information versus the measured temperature and salinity gradients in these simulations which are then inserted as values into eq 12 the gradients were measured along a horizontal distance of 1 km in the aquifer at z 300 m which is 100 m below the seepage point fig 5 as predicted by theory vsgd linearly increases with temperature and salinity gradient following the mathematical form predicted by eq 12 however we do note 2 deviations from theory 1 the theoretical slope is 1 25 2 5 while the model yields a slope of 1 02 and 2 the y intercept of the straight line is b 0 1 and not zero as predicted by theory this will be further discussed below it is interesting to note that modeling results find that temperature changes open squares in fig 7 affect the seepage velocity about an order of magnitude less than the salinity changes closed squares this is because the thermal expansion coefficient is one quarter of the solutal one α and β in table 1 and because the temperature differences introduced in the system maximal δ t was 11 c are about one third of the salinity differences maximal δ s was 39 g kg 6 discussion the most important result of the present work is that under natural conditions steady state deep sgd of water with salinity lower than seawater is possible fig 5 this deep submarine seepage occurs under certain conditions in confined aquifers that are exposed to the sea the seepage is intense and focused within the narrow gap between the fstz and the top of the aquifer exposure modeled seepage velocities in the baseline simulation are around 0 1 m d in the baseline simulation the seepage salinity is slightly lower than seawater but in case of lower conductivity of the confining unit or elevated heads on land salinity may decrease dramatically see ssgd in table 2 an offshore exposure of a submarine confined aquifer produces an elongated and flattened fstz that is pushed seawards dsgd emerges as part of a dynamic steady state in a system where a direct underground hydrological connection exists between the land area of freshwater recharge and the deep sea area most previous models studying the hydrology of submarine confined aquifers did not assume confined aquifer exposure to the sea and instead imposed a no flow boundary between the aquifer and the sea hindering seepage e g bakker 2006 kooi and groen 2001 but this no flow boundary assumption is not always true in some cases the aquifer may be directly connected to the sea for example when canyons dissect the continental shelf cutting into the aquifer as in the asc here or when permeable faults cut through the confining layer and the aquifer as in monterey bay california breen and orange 1992 orange et al 2002 when the aquifer is exposed numerical simulations should use a constant seawater head boundary between the aquifer and the sea which according to our simulations may under some conditions push the fstz seawards and allow for intense seepage this conjecture is supported by the results of michael et al 2016 who used a constant head bc in models of heterogeneous submarine aquifers and found freshwater wedges reaching up to 50 km offshore this mechanism provides a possible explanation for the presence and seepage of fresh brackish groundwater in deep areas offshore in steady state conditions the other leading explanation for dsgd that of transient seepage due to hydrological relicts of a past lower sea level is likely suitable in many of the observed dsgd sites in the world post et al 2013 yet the steady state mechanism suggested in the current work may dominate in other places and also provide an alternative mechanism where the transient mechanism is unfeasible e g johnston 1983 an example of such a situation where our proposed dsgd mechanism may apply is given by the recent work of gustafson et al 2019 who find fresh water extending far offshore the eastern coast of the u s their conceptual model relates the seaward extension of a freshwater body to a basin ward dipping aquifer that encounters a monocline structure which forces the fresh water to flow upwards towards the seafloor it is likely that such a monocline is characterized by faulting at its peak exposing the aquifer to the sea and thus providing a situation similar to the scenario presented here where a steady state dsgd arises from the offshore exposure of a submarine confined aquifer the circulation within the confined aquifer and the character of the resulting dsgd as modeled here depend on the hydraulic conductivity of the confining layer above the aquifer as discussed in the next section 6 1 confinement and head effect on circulation mode our modeling results show that 3 modes of circulation arise in the exposed confined aquifer depending on the efficiency to which the aquifer is confined by the overlying aquitard dictated by the conductivity of the aquitard k c 1 in a poorly confined aquifer high k c the circulation mode resembles that of a phreatic aquifer as modeled by wilson 2005 a full separation occurs between two independent systems of sgd the deep sgd results from geothermal convection of pure seawater whereas the brackish fresh sgd is limited to the near shore scale and is the result of seawater circulation due to salinity gradients fig 6b 2 in a highly confined aquifer low k c the deep seepage is given by direct freshwater flow from the land to the deep seepage site fig 6a a spatially small convection cell develops where seawater is sucked in at the bottom part of the aquifer exposure driven by both thermal and salt dispersion effects the seawater spends a relatively short time in the aquifer 90 yr before it seeps out in the middle of the outcrop despite the small dimensions of the convection cell the relative amount of seawater sucked into the aquifer was high psc 0 7 meaning seawater accounts for about 40 of the total circulation this can be explained by the steep salinity gradients near the outcrop due to the extended fresh water wedge that lead to rapid circulation eq 10 this scenario of fresh dsgd from a confined submarine aquifer that is exposed offshore was already suggested and modeled by amir et al 2013 using an analysis of the onshore structure of a confined coastal aquifer in central israel in our present work the modeled fresh dsgd is based on a thorough study of both the onshore and the offshore structure of the aquifer additionally amir et al 2013 applied a very low conductivity of the confining unit 6 orders of magnitude lower than that of the aquifer here the conductivity difference is only 3 orders of magnitude and is based on realistic calibrated conductivities of the aquifer and the confining layers from the study area dafny et al 2010 kafri and kessler 2001 paldor et al 2019 3 between end members 1 and 2 an intermediate case was discovered that of brackish dsgd fig 6c in this scenario the transition zone between fresh and seawater the fstz reaches from the shore to the outcrop 15 km offshore and is quite thick here the two convection cells the thermally driven and the salinity driven unite creating an fstz that constitutes both a salinity boundary and a thermal boundary the spontaneous formation of a united salinity and thermal boundary layer within a convection cell was termed previously double diffusive convection e g bischoff and rosenbauer 1989 griffiths 1981 huppert and turner 1981 the thermo haline circulation that develops in the confined aquifer drives seawater into the aquifer where it mixes with freshwater through salt dispersion and then circulates back and seeps as brackish dsgd fig 6c this mechanism for brackish dsgd provides potentially important insights to the global research of the phenomenon for example lin et al 2010 used δ 18 o as a tracer for dsgd in the kaoping submarine canyon offshore taiwan the thermo haline mechanism implies that brackish dsgd might not bear the chemical signature of terrestrial water such as δ 18 o because even though it is not 100 seawater salinity it might comprise mostly seawater that recirculated in the confined aquifer and diluted via salt dispersion similar to the effect of aquifer confinement we found that increasing head on land also shifts the system between different modes of circulation elevating head on land is equivalent to lowering hydraulic conductivity of the confining unit fig s1 in the supporting information this result is rather intuitive the mode of circulation and seepage depends on the offshore extent of the freshwater tongue freshwater extends further offshore as it is pushed more effectively either by capping the aquifer efficiently or by increasing the driving head there are other factors in the modeled hydrologic system that are expected to affect the mode of circulation such as aquifer geometry flexural vs horizontal aquifer exposure length i e the length of the subsea outcrop aquifer conductivity and more these factors are beyond the scope of the present study and merit further work 6 2 fit between theory and model both the theoretical calculations section 4 and the numerical model fig 7 predict a linear correlation between seepage velocity and temperature and salinity horizontal gradients according to the theory the slope of the linear fit is expected to be between 1 25 and 2 5 eq 12 while in the numerical simulations it was 1 02 for such complex hydrological systems over such large scales a 25 150 error is a very good quantitative fit between the theory and the model if for example the theory is used to predict the aquifer conductivity based on measured gradients and seepage velocity then the theory would predict an aquifer conductivity of 50 100 m d instead of the actual 40 m d again for such large scale hydrological systems this is a very good approximation as noted in fig 7 the y intercept of the equation relating between the developed gradients and the seepage velocity was not zero as predicted by the theory this is due to the fact that at some point a further decrease of gradients pushing the fstz landwards suppressed the circulation and the seeps so the system transitioned to a different flow regime this effect is not captured in the theoretical calculations presented in section 4 in regards to the thermo haline circulation that produces dsgd the seepage velocity depends on temperature changes much less than it depends on the salinity ones this is revealed by comparing the variations in vsgd that arise due to changes in temperature gradients open squares in fig 7 vs those that arise from salinity changes closed squares salinity variations altered the seepage velocity in the range of 0 05 0 3 m d while temperature changes caused the seepage velocity to shift between 0 12 and 0 15 m d this can also be theoretically calculated for a given δ x when looking at the two terms in eq 12 α t x β s x in the simulation with the highest thermal contrast between seawater and terrestrial water the temperature difference was δ t 9 c so the thermal term is approximately α δ t δ x 1 8 10 3 δ x 1 m in contrast the highest salinity difference between seawater and terrestrial water was δ s 39 g k g so the haline term is β δ s δ x 3 1 10 2 δ x 1 m i e 17 times larger than the thermal term kurylyk et al 2018 demonstrated the limitations of using thermal signatures to track sgd and suggested that sub surface salt domes in the scotian slope reverse the subsea groundwater circulation thus reversing the expected thermal profile across the slope the present work supports this suggestion as both the model and theoretical calculations predict that salinity differences dominate the circulation patterns while temperature profiles might be dictated by the circulation and are not necessarily responsible for it 6 3 implications for the study area the modeling study presented above suggests that submarine groundwater discharge of either fresh or brackish groundwater should be expected in the achziv submarine canyon asc fig 1 indeed numerous independent observations point to the presence of relatively fresh pore water at the bottom of the asc 1 rubin blum et al 2014 found bacteria typical of the vicinity of hydrothermal vents iron oxidizing zetaprteobacteria in various places in the continental margin of israel among them achziv canyon they link the presence of this community in the sediments to pore water upward flux 2 at the asc bottlenose dolphins tursiops truncatus are anomalously abundant compared to other areas in the eastern mediterranean suggesting it is a zone of high biologic production elasar et al 2013 3 recent hydrographic surveys in the asc point that indeed there is a plume of low salinity anomaly close to the seafloor right at the submarine outcrop of the judea group aquifer paldor et al phd hebrew university of jerusalem 2019 4 our previous modeling work of the asc and the hydrology of the study area also suggested dsgd this work was validated using data from water wells in the western galilee area paldor et al 2019 7 conclusions 1 coastal confined aquifers may provide a connection between the land recharge of freshwater and deep sea areas if they are exposed in the deep sea via canyon incision or faults such exposure allows for formation of large hydrological circulation cells and deep submarine discharge 2 in such cases the conventional no flow boundary condition which is often used to model coastal confined aquifers must be exchanged with a free surface boundary condition constant head in order to capture the emerging sgd and fresh water wedge offshore 3 the character of the dsgd fresh brackish saltwater and the mode of the circulation thermal haline thermo haline depend on the degree of aquifer confinement i e the hydraulic conductivity of the aquitard overlying the aquifer on head on land and on other parameters that still need to be studied aquifer geometry conductivity aquifer outcrop length 4 while coastal phreatic aquifers may develop 2 circulation cells the first density driven near the shore and the other thermally driven on the shelf a confined exposed aquifer may develop a single thermo haline circulation cell that unites the two and drives brackish dsgd 5 in that case the seepage velocity is linearly correlated to the thermal and haline horizontal gradients that develop in the confined aquifer at the outcrop area where the circulation is initiated declaration of competing interest the

6014,deep submarine groundwater discharge dsgd is a ubiquitous and highly significant phenomenon yet it remains poorly understood this work proposes a simple theoretical basis for steady state dsgd from a confined aquifer the simple theory is tested against numerical modeling feflow of a case study of dsgd offshore northern israel eastern mediterranean sea modeling further investigates the hydrogeological setting that enables dsgd and the parameters that affect it conductivity of the confining unit head on land seawater salinity and seawater temperature the main findings are thus steady state dsgd eminates far offshore from a confined aquifer exposed by a submarine canyon even under moderate heads it is driven by a thermohaline circulation cell that forms around an intrinsic transition zone between salty cold seawater and fresh warm terrestrial groundwater the circulation is driven by tilted isopycnals and consists of seawater entering the confined aquifer at the exposed section offshore mixing with terrestrial groundwater within the aquifer and seeping back out to the sea as saline warm water the circulation mode and the character of the dsgd depend on the conductivity of the confining unit and on the hydraulic head the seepage velocity is linearly related to the temperature and salinity gradients that develop in the confined aquifer during the thermohaline circulation these new insights have potentially important implications for coastal hydrology seawater chemistry biogeochemistry and submarine slope instability keywords coastal hydrogeology deep submarine groundwater discharge confined coastal aquifers thermo haline groundwater circulations 1 introduction submarine groundwater discharge sgd is a well known phenomenon in the coastal environment and a significant factor in the water budget of coastal aquifers burnett et al 2001 moore 1999 moosdorf and oehler 2017 post 2005 werner et al 2013 it is also important for biogeochemical processes in the marine environment and affects marine ecosystems in terms of nutrient supply johannes 1980 michael et al 2017 moore 2010 and submarine slope instability breen and orange 1992 orange et al 1994 2002 the importance of sgd led to increasingly widespread exploration via measurements burnett et al 2006 2001 cable et al 1996 lambert and burnett 2003 moore 1996 swarzenski et al 2006 and modeling bokuniewicz 1992 cooper 1959 croucher and o sullivan 1995 glover 1959 henry 1959 huyakorn et al 1987 mcbride and pfannkuch 1975 smith 2004 smith and zawadzki 2003 most of the above mentioned studies focused on shallow unconfined coastal aquifers discharging to the sea close to the shore although sgd often also occurs from confined and semi confined aquifers at sites located much further offshore bratton 2010 categorized sgd according to its distance from the shore see fig 4 there nearshore scale 10 m offshore embayment scale 10 km and shelf scale sgd occurring at the edge of the shelf 10 km from shore the last two scales are less studied and described such deep sgd are the focus of this study and will be termed hereafter dsgd one of the fundamental questions regarding dsgd relates to the driving force for the phenomenon wilson 2005 used numerical modeling to show that geothermal heat flux can be an important factor for vast seawater recirculation in the shelf break area her results obtained from a shelf scale model of an unconfined aquifer suggest a full separation between two mechanisms of sgd 1 convection of pure seawater through the aquifer driven by geothermal temperature gradients causing seepage of recirculated seawater through the shelf far offshore 100 km and 2 density driven circulation and dispersive mixing along the fresh salt water transition zone hereafter abbreviated fstz that invokes coastal freshwater brackish sgd as explained by cooper 1959 the two types of sgd cause two spatially separated circulation cells that are simultaneously active in unconfined coastal aquifers and produce two widely different seepage locations and salinities thermally driven dsgd comprising pure seawater and salinity gradient driven fresh or brackish coastal sgd however pure seawater dsgd is clearly not the whole story since mounting evidence suggests that brackish fresh dsgd is both prevalent and significant post et al 2013 groundwater reserves with salinity lower than seawater were observed at different locations off the east coast of the u s with offshore distances ranging from 30 km to 130 km cohen et al 2010 gustafson et al 2019 hathaway et al 1979 johnston 1983 manheim 1967 person et al 2003 robb 1984 thomas et al 2019 off the west coast of the u s there are also places where seepage or the underground presence of brackish saline water are evident essaid 1990 orange et al 2002 in taiwan fresh water seepage offshore the pingtung coastal zone is evident too about 30 km offshore at water depth of 1200 mbsl lin et al 2010 the suggested mechanisms for the above mentioned occurrences of low salinity waters in deep areas offshore include sediment compaction breen and orange 1992 monoclines in a dipping subsea aquifer gustafson et al 2019 and entrapped remnants of past lower sea level essaid 1990 kooi and groen 2001 robb 1984 in taiwan the mechanism for such deep freshwater seepage is not discussed lin et al 2010 a common thread linking these previous observational studies are their suggestions that special transient conditions drive the observed dsgd namely past changes in sea level or sediment compaction the reason that the simpler explanation of steady state dsgd driven by elevated head on land was not invoked in those cases is that previously typical freshwater heads on land were calculated to be insufficient to drive direct steady state groundwater flow all the way from land to the shelf e g cohen et al 2010 person et al 2003 robb 1984 however these calculations commonly assume a no flow boundary between the aquifer and the sea e g kooi and groen 2001 while an assumption of an open boundary condition for the aquifer would yield a completely different result post et al 2013 point that both types of dsgd transient and steady state are ubiquitous around the world and suggest that although in some places it is possible for present day conditions to drive fresh meteoric water to deep areas e g johnston 1983 kooi and groen 2001 vast meteoric groundwater reservoirs vmgr in deep sea may be remnants of past conditions of lower stand of the sea e g essaid 1990 hathaway et al 1979 they explain the transient mechanism as follows sea level rise causes the terrestrial hydrologic system to be pushed landwards and the underground system responds to this abrupt change at rates that are orders of magnitude lower than the rate of sea level rise this retardation dictates the entrapment of fossil water under the new interglacial post sea level rise continental shelf this transient mechanism is widely considered as the most plausible explanation for observations of brackish or fresh groundwater at the shelf scale either in the form of active seeps or as stagnant reservoirs as another example several studies have sought to connect the presence of fresh groundwater in distal areas offshore the eastern coast of the us mainly in the new england area cohen et al 2010 hathaway et al 1979 meisler et al 1984 person et al 2003 robb 1984 to confined submarine aquifers that outcrop far offshore cohen et al 2010 person et al 2003 robb 1984 recently thomas et al 2019 contested the idea that the offshore freshwater orginates from confined aquifers they simulated the landward retreat of a freshwater wedge that extended 100 km off the new jersey shore at the last glacial maxima their model showed that the fresh groundwater wedge does not represent a present day connection between the land meteoric recharge area and the offshore suggesting that fresh groundwater occurrence far offshore the eastern coast of the us represents transient conditions yet steady state conditions are likely sufficient to maintain fresh water offshore at least in some situations one example was revealed by johnston 1983 who reported fresh water occurrence far offshore 88 km fernandina beach between florida and georgia usa the freshwater tongue is not related to past low sea level but is related to present day conditions and may represent the present steady state although it was also suggested there that the fresh water tongue is currently migrating landwards due to recent pumping several studies have attempted to model steady state dsgd of brackish fresh water through a submarine confined aquifer e g amir et al 2013 bakker 2006 kooi and groen 2001 werner and robinson 2018 typically such modeling studies assume idealized conditions of the aquifer e g horizontal geometry infinite confinement on land and more one common and important assumption is that the contact between the aquifer and the sea is a no flow boundary and seepage is allowed only as upward leakage from the aquifer through the confining layer bakker 2006 kooi and groen 2001 werner and robinson 2018 in contrast amir et al 2013 modeled a confined coastal aquifer offshore palmahim area in central israel and suggested the exposure of the confined aquifer about 25 km offshore as a hypothetical hydrogeological setting this exposure together with an assumed strong confinement 6 orders of magnitude difference in hydraulic conductivity between the aquifer and the overlying confining units produced steady state dsgd of fresh water in their model a different configuration which also produced steady state dsgd is provided by michael et al 2016 who showed that hypothetic permeability heterogeneities within a coastal aquifer produce dsgd far a few tens of kilometers and up to a 100 km offshore with the extent depending on horizontal continuity of the heterogeneities despite extensive research on dsgd many questions remain open under what conditions does dsgd of brackish fresh water arise at steady state present day conditions may terrestrial groundwater systems be connected to the deep sea and if yes how what is the hydrological mechanism driving this dsgd and what controls the circulation mode and the seepage characteristics what is the source of the seeping water this work investigates exactly these basic questions concentrating on unraveling one mechanism producing steady state dsgd that of seepage from a confined aquifer that is exposed far offshore first a theoretical background is provided explaining the mechanism driving circulation in confined submarine aquifers and the relation to dsgd then using a case study offshore north israel eastern mediterranean sea as a basis for a hydrogeological modeling study dsgd is simulated from a confined aquifer with flexural structure exposed in the deep areas at the edge of the continental shelf last the possibility of dsgd through a confined coastal aquifer that is exposed offshore is discussed and analyzed it will be shown below that even under moderate heads on land very intense dsgd occurs with no special conditions the engine for this dsgd is the tilting of isopycnals due to the density difference between cold salty seawater on one side and warmer brackish groundwater on the other this tilting of isopycnals between the two boundaries induces a convection cell within the aquifer and intense seepage of brackish water comprising mostly recirculated seawater as dsgd 2 study area as a case study for a hydrological system of a subsea confined aquifer the area offshore northern israel is used fig 1 paldor et al 2019 extensively analyzed and validated the hydrogeological setting in the area and it will only be briefly presented here offshore the achziv submarine canyon asc carves into the continental shelf and narrows it to approximately 2 km width the shelf morphology in the area is characterized by submarine canyons almagor 1993 but the asc is the most developed canyon in the region and the one that reaches closest to the shore it is also the only canyon that is oriented nw se while the others are shore perpendicular e w onshore the mountainous western galilee area rises up to 1200 m above the mean sea level msl starting around 3 km from the shoreline where the coastal plain ends the judea group jg comprises late cretaceous carbonates that are mostly well karstified and are exposed over most of the western galilee area sneh 2004 given its vast exposure areas and its karstic nature the jg aquifer is a major reservoir in the western galilee hydrologic system and holds about 90 of the total 60 mcm yr million cubic meters per year recharge there kessler and kafri 2008 according to the geological analysis presented by paldor et al 2019 the jg aquifer onshore offshore structure presents a unique hydrogeological setting in which the aquifer has a flexural structure in the shallow shelf and at the hinge of the anticline the achziv submarine canyon exposes it to the sea fig 2 this flexural structure of the cretaceous units was also suggested in several other studies from the eastern mediterranean offshore bakalowicz et al 2008 schattner et al 2006 and was shown to extend northwards at least through lebanon elias 2006 3 methods to analyze and discuss mechanisms for dsgd from submarine confined aquifer we use two main tools a numercial hydrological model presented in this section and a simple theoretical model for the relationship between seepage velocity vsgd and salinity temperature gradients in the system presented in section 4 below 3 1 groundwater model a numerical groundwater model is constructed based on an actual case study which was extensively discussed and validated by paldor et al 2019 and was briefly presented above in section 2 the groundwater model is used to analyze the effect of different scenarios of aquifer confinement and driving head i e different hydraulic conductivity of confining units denoted kc and different hydraulic head values on land on seepage on the position of the fstz and on circulation a baseline scenario is then used for a sensitivity analysis that compares between the results of the theoretical calculations presented in section 4 below and the numerical model the sensitivity analysis tests the model response to changes in seawater salinity and temperature using the following model outputs seepage velocity salinity and temperature out of these three outputs the seepage velocity vsgd is compared to the predicted vsgd from the theory the model was constructed to mimic the structure of the jg aquifer and its exposure offshore by the submarine canyon see fig 2 for the canyon location as presented in fig 3 two rock units are considered a highly conductive unit confined by an aquitard where the base of the aquifer is considered impermeable the aquifer exposure offshore requires exchanging the no flow boundary condition that was used in most previous models of submarine confined aquifers e g bakker 2006 kooi and groen 2001 with a constant seawater head boundary condition at the exposed site as shown in fig 3 the major faults that were mapped in the area by bronshtein and sagy 2018 are not included in the model as they are further into the sea than the aquifer exposure in the canyon area it is expected that the faults will amplify the dsgd discussed in this work as they probably serve as hydraulic barriers with low longitudinal hydraulic conductivity hence the exclusion of the faults from the model is a conservative approach 3 2 numerical implementation the hydrologic model was calculated using the finite element flow modeling software feflow diersch 2014 version 7 0 the model solves for the coupled head and salinity evolution the governing equation for diffusion of hydraulic head h is solved neglecting dynamics of the unsaturated zone and assuming no sources sinks 1 h t 1 ρ s s ρ q here s s q are the specific storage and the darcy flux respectively see table 1 for units the mass transport equation was solved in

applied time step length was automatically calculated with feflow s predictor corrector tool using second order scheme forward adams bashforth backward trapezoid rule with a restriction on time step length of 3 days maximum this restriction optimizes computation time while maintaining numerical stability the finite element scheme used was the galerkin fem no upwinding fig 3 depicts the geometry and boundary conditions bc of the model triangular mesh elements were selected with side length ranging between 20 and 50 m 3 3 boundary conditions the right and left hand sides of the model were treated as boundaries of no flow mass or heat flux the base of the aquifer was also set as a no flow boundary and no mass flux but basal heat flux of 45 mw m2 was applied there land surface was a boundary of constant temperature 23 c corresponding to the measured temperature at the groundwater level in the study area paldor et al phd hebrew university of jerusalem 2019 a constant freshwater head and concentration was introduced through the aquifer terrestrial exposure area fig 3 the seafloor was maintained at fixed seawater head and salinity salinity was changed between simulations within the range of 30 39 g l corresponding to the observed global range of ocean salinities hosoda et al 2009 seafloor temperature decreased exponentially with depth as t seafloor z a b e z c this equation is the best fit for the measured temperature depth profile at the area of study paldor et al phd hebrew university of jerusalem 2019 the parameters a b and c are changed to ensure consistency

depth which for the baseline simulation was 14 thus b was 9 to test the effects of seafloor temperature on the circulation a was changed between 12 and 21 c and accordingly b ranged between 11 and 2 the parameter c was used to alter the shape of the temperature depth curve so that it qualitatively fits the observed rate of decay with depth between the maximal seafloor temperature and the minimal paldor et al phd hebrew university of jerusalem 2019 the range of this parameter was 80 c 150 head on the seafloor varied with depth according to the water density ratio δ ρ seawater ρ freshwater ρ freshwater as h seafloor z z δ i e head increases linearly with depth δ was determined according to the seawater density which depended on maximal salinity and minimal temperature through a linear equation of state eq 4 above the most important bc that we impose is constant seawater head at the location where the aquifer is exposed on the shelf this is in contrast to many models of submarine confined aquifers that use a no flow bc at the location where the confined aquifer meets the sea e g bakker 2006 kooi and groen 2001 a no flow bc would have effectively hindered dsgd and circulation see fig 3 for a summary of the bc s applied the aim of this work is to study steady state seepage and hence it would have seemed reasonable to run the model for steady state conditions i e solve eqs 1 3 with zero on the left hand sides however steady state simulations often do not converge huyakorn et al 1987 therefore the simulations were run using the full evolution eqs 1 3 until steady state was reached for seepage velocity salinity and temperature in order to assess the likelihood of natural steady state in the aquifer and the aquitard one may calculate the response time as follows 5 τ s s l 2 k where τ is the response time s s is the specific storage l is a characteristic length of the hydrogeologic unit aquifer or aquitard and k is its hydraulic conductivity for the aquifer the characteristic length l should be taken as the horizontal length of the aquifer because the general flow direction in it is land to sea for the aquitard which generally transports water vertically l should be the aquitard thickness using the values of the simulated aquifer and aquitard table 1 in eq 5 the response time is approximately 4 years for the aquifer and 10 years for the aquitard for an aquitard conductivity of 10 2 m d compared to processes that may alter the hydrogeological conditions e g sea level rise sedimentation precipitation decrease etc the response time is nearly immediate and hence steady state seems highly likely for the modeled hydrological system it should be noted that the conductivity of the confining unit aquitard in the natural system might be lower than the simulated values although the values used here are verified both by dafny et al 2010 and by paldor et al 2019 if so then the response time for the aquitard is longer than 10 years potentially by orders of magnitude which might mean that the flow in the aquitard is not in steady state however this work is focused on the circulation within the confined aquifer itself and hence the steady state of the natural system is likely to examine the effect of aquifer confinement the hydraulic conductivity of the confining units k c was changed in the range 0 01 4 m d three levels of confinement were tested highly confined k c 0 01 m d poorly confined k c 4 m d and intermediate confinement k c 0 07 m d high confinement means that the aquifer is effectively sealed by a very low conductivity unit while poorly confined is an aquifer close to phreatic these values are in the range of the hydraulic conductivities of the geologic layers overlying the judea group in the study area as calibrated by dafny et al 2010 and validated by paldor et al 2019 then the intermediate confinement was used as the baseline simulation for the sensitivity test which was carried out varying three model bcs 1 the temperature of the seawater 2 seawater salinity and 3 head on land fig 3 3 4 values of parameters used in the simulations and the measured outputs for the baseline simulation the conductivity in the aquifer was taken as 40 m d which is suitable for fine sand and for karstic limestones freeze and cherry 1979 this value was adopted following the validation presented by paldor et al 2019 the head applied on land was 30 m which is on the lower side of the values observed in the research area kafri and kessler 2001 the reason why we used the lower bound of head is to ensure that we are on the conservative side and emphasize the fact that the suggested mechanism for dsgd does not require high heads on land higher values will only enhance the mechanism presented here as shown by the sensitivity analysis longitudinal and transverse dispersivities were taken as 30 m and 3 m respectively table 1 these values were found to be high enough to maintain a low peclet number and ensure numerical stability voss and souza 1987 but still within the physically acceptable range for the scale of our problem gelhar et al 1992 the quantities measured from the simulations are 1 seepage velocity vsgd in table 2 2 seepage salinity ssgd 3 seepage temperature tsgd 4 total 2d flux of water through dsgd out of the aquifer qsgd in table 2 vsgd ssgd and tsgd were measured at the point in the outcrop in which the velocity towards the sea was highest usually 2 3 nodes away from the seafloor itself the seafloor obviously is not appropriate for these measurements because the bc s are applied there another measured result is the simulated relative contribution of the seawater circulation to the dsgd called psc percent seawater circulation this follows smith 2004 who calculated the psc as the ratio between seawater and fresh water components of sgd here psc is calculated as 6 psc q swi q fwi where q swi is the volume of seawater entering the aquifer through the outcrop offshore table 2 and q fwi is the volume of water recharging on land into the aquifer hence psc in this work virtually measures the circulation intensity as it indicates how effectively seawater is being sucked into the aquifer relative to the freshwater input this suction of seawater dictates the intensity of the circulation and according to the theoretical calculations presented below it is expected to be linearly proportional to horizontal density gradients that develop in the aquifer when the seawater suction and circulation are very low the major component of the aquifer water input is the freshwater recharge on land and psc is close to zero 4 theory the physics of density driven groundwater circulation when the isopycnals iso density lines in the aquifer are tilted a horizontal hydrostatic pressure gradient may develop depending on the geometry of the aquifer this is easily seen for a theoretical rectangular fully confined aquifer in which one side is held at a constant density ρ 1 and the other is held at a different density ρ 2 ρ 1 δ ρ and a transition zone separates between the two fluids fig 4 consider two points at the bottom of the aquifer situated a distance δ x apart both within the wedge of higher density fluid as in fig 4 a difference in hydrostatic pressure between the 2 points arises due to the difference in the weight of fluid columns situated above them δ p δ x tan θ δ ρ g hence the horizontal hydraulic pressure gradient is p x δ ρ g tan θ in the configuration of fig 4 where δ ρ 0 this pressure gradient is negative and thus initiates flow within the wedge of heavier fluid towards the right conservation of mass dictates the counter flow of lighter fluid from above to the left i e a circulation is initiated as discussed in phillips 2009 equation 4 3 p 128 the rotation vector of this circulation cell denoted ω the vorticity measures the circulation intensity and equals the curl of the flow velocity and hence has dimensions of 1 t 7 ω u according to darcy s law the flow velocity depends on the pressure gradient it can easily be shown from vector calculus that the curl of the velocity is a vector with all zero components the curl of a gradient is zero except for the y component which depends on the horizontal buoyancy gradient 8 ω κ ν b x y where κ is the permeability in units of m2 ν is the kinematic viscosity in m2 s b is the buoyancy force per unit mass in m s2 defined as b g ρ 0 ρ ρ 0 ρ 0 is a reference density typically the lowest in the system i e the freshwater density adopting a linear equation of state see eq 4 above the buoyancy force driving the circulation is given by 9 b g α t β s for two dimensional circulation where the x axis is horizontal and z axis is vertical y is also horizontal perpendicular to x see fig 4 the rotation vector is 10 ω k α t x k β s x y where k is the hydraulic conductivity the rotation vector is a vector pointing in the y direction eq 8 which means that the flow is rotational only in x z plane the schematic diagram in fig 4 presents a setting in which the temperature increases in the x direction i e the first term in the right hand side of eq 10 is negative and the salinity decreases in this direction i e the second term is also negative this means that ω points in the negative y direction implying counter clockwise rotation seawater enters the aquifer below the warm freshwater wedge rotates upwards and left and flows back to the sea as shown in fig 4 by solid black curve with arrows the schematic situation in fig 4 directly applies to the well known henry problem henry 1959 which describes an ideally confined i e confining units have an hydraulic conductivity of zero rectangular aquifer in which fresh water enters on one end and the other boundary is maintained at a constant seawater salinity indeed it has been shown that the henry problem results in a steady state configuration with inclined isopycnals i e an inclined seawater freshwater transition zone see e g fig 7 in abarca et al 2007 as discussed above inclined isopycnals are predicted by eq 8 to drive circulation previous experiments and simulations of the henry problem indeed show seepage from the top salty boundary e g fig 10 of karasaki et al 2006 in reality and in the research presented here aquifers are not ideal they are not fully confined horizontal or rectangular as in the ideal henry problem but instead have more realistic structure and confining conductivity confining units are semi pervious this should not change the basic physics but may modify the magnitude of ω after calculating the rotation vector of the velocity the representative flow velocity may be inferred for the circulation the scaling between the rotation vector ω with units 1 s and the representative flow velocity u with units m s requires some length scale phillips 2009 relates between the circulation intensity the magnitude of the rotation vector and the representative flow velocity via aquifer thickness denoted h for rigid body rotation the magnitudes of the curl of the flow ω and the angular velocity ω are related via ω 2 ω the linear velocity is related to the angular velocity through the radius of curvature which in this case may be approximated by half the aquifer thickness h 2 hence it is suggested that 1 4 of the aquifer thickness might be more appropriate for scaling between the rotation vector and the representative flow velocity at least for certain settings 11 u ω r ω 2 h 2 ω h 4 finally translating the average circulation velocity u to seepage velocity vsgd requires an amplification factor because the seepage occurs through a narrow aperture between the top of the fstz and the top of the aquifer and is thus amplified significantly compared to the average circulation velocity in all the model realizations conducted in this work this amplification factor was in the range of 5 10 therefore based on eqs 10 and 11 the seepage velocity can be approximated as 12 v sgd a k h α t x β s x with a being a prefactor predicted to be roughly in the range of 5 4 to 10 4 according to eq 12 in case of dsgd from a confined aquifer that arises from thermo haline circulations the seepage velocity vsgd is expected to increase linearly with temperature and salinity gradients driving the circulation the intensity of the circulation is also expected to increase linearly with the temperature and salinity gradients eq 10 in what follows these theoretical relationships will be examined in light of the results of the numerical model 5 results we ran 15 simulations while varying conductivity of the confining layer k c salinity of seawater temperature of the sea and hydraulic head on land the runs and their parameters are summarized in table s1 in the supporting material run 1 is considered our baseline simulation since it has 1 the head level on land that is presently documented 2 the calibrated aquifer conductivity 3 the conductivity of confining unit that is most likely in the study area and 4 the present day water temperatures and salinities see dafny et al 2010 kafri and fleischer 2003 kafri and kessler 2001 paldor et al 2019 5 1 baseline simulation result steady state dsgd and associated circulation fig 5 shows the salinity distribution and flow vectors for the baseline simulation this simulation produced a steady state dsgd of brackish water ssgd was about 98 seawater salinity seepage velocity was intense vsgd 0 1 m d seepage temperature was tsgd 16 1 c in fig 5 the point at which vsgd ssgd and tsgd are measured for the baseline simulation is marked with a white dot this point is located 20 m from the seafloor boundary see section 3 4 for details once the system reaches a steady state configuration it is found that this state is a dynamic steady state where the fstz is pushed far offshore compared to phreatic aquifers its position is constant in time but there is a vigorous circulation cell seawater enters at the lower part of the aquifer as seen in fig 5 flows towards the toe of the ftsz which spans 5 km as seen in fig 5 upwells within the aquifer according to the streamline shown in fig 5 reaches the ftsz and then turns back to flow towards the ocean as shown by the white streamline in the circulation cell of fig 5 this is the cell drawn schematically as a cartoon in fig 4 it takes about 500 years in the baseline simulation before a drop of seawater that entered at the bottom of the jg exposure seeps out again at its top 5 2 three basic modes of circulation this section studies the effect of varying aquitard conductivity and freshwater head on the behavior of the modeled hydrological system we present first the effect of confinement on circulation and then present the effect of head results are summarized in table 2 5 2 1 end member 1 highly confined aquifer produces freshwater seepage when the aquifer is highly confined i e very low k c even low realistic heads applied on land are sufficient to drive fresh terrestrial groundwater all the way from the recharge area on land to the dsgd site in the canyon fig 6 a this is enabled by the aquifer exposure offshore which allows discharge seepage in this case is very intense 0 6 m d table 2 and with very low salinity 75 seawater salinity was measured close to the seawater boundary white dot in fig 5 but salinity decayed to less than 15 rapidly over 100 m away from the boundary the psc see eq 6 was high for this simulation 0 7 because salinity gradients near the outcrop were increased as the freshwater wedge reached far offshore in the confined aquifer these increased gradients increase the suction of seawater into the aquifer due to density differences as explained in section 4 and the seawater component of the aquifer circulation is 40 however fig 6a shows that the seawater seeps out below the freshwater so near the top of the outcrop the seepage is fresh and it becomes saltier going down along the outcrop this scenario resembles the typical near shore circulation as portrayed by cooper 1959 and it can be seen as a hydrogeological shoreline that is pushed seawards in the confined aquifer from the actual shoreline in this simulation the majority of the water that is recharged into the aquifer either as freshwater or as sucked seawater is discharged as dsgd through the submarine outcrop of the aquifer qsgd was 26 8 m d2 which is 71 of q swi q fwi 15 3 22 2 m d2 table 2 the remaining 29 leave the system as leaks through the confining unit these leaks are not plotted due to negligible velocities 5 2 2 end member 2 poorly confined aquifer produces two circulation cells when the conductivity of the confining unit is close to that of the aquifer the system behaves like the wilson 2005 model full separation between the geothermal circulation in deep areas and salt dispersion and saline sgd at the near shore scale fig 6b in this simulation seepage velocity was very low vsgd 0 04 m d table 2 qsgd was low too 4 9 m2 d and comprised purely seawater ssgd 100 seawater salinity as expected the seepage through the aquifer outcrop in the submarine canyon qsgd represents a very small component of the total recharge into the aquifer qswi qfwi q sgd q swi q fwi 4 9 107 13 6 0 04 only 4 of the water that entered the aquifer discharged out of it as dsgd the vast majority of the discharge was coastal sgd in addition the close outlet to the sea that was enabled with the high conductivity of the overlying aquitard the shoreline dictated that for the same head on land enormous volumes of freshwater recharged into the aquifer on land 107 m2 d table 2 the psc was the lowest measured in all simulations 0 1 meaning that the sucked seawater is 10 of the freshwater recharged on land in this case psc has a different meaning it was devised to quantify water sources within a single circulation cell but here due to the separate circulation cells psc tells us that the thermal seawater circulation cell which is independent of the fw circulation cell is also 10 times weaker 5 2 3 intermediate case produces a single thermohaline circulation cell as seen in fig 6c the intermediate confinement causes the two mechanisms to converge dsgd is brackish and not 100 seawater salinity yet fresh water originated on land does not reach the seepage site instead it percolates upwards up to about 6 kms offshore the streamlines show that the seawater geothermal circulation merges with the circulation due to salt dispersion within the confined aquifer seepage in this simulation was vsgd 0 1 m d and although no streamline indicated flow of meteoric water all the way to the seepage site the seepage salinity was ssgd 95 thus the intermediate confinement produced brackish dsgd that arises due to thermo haline circulation in the confined aquifer according to the theory equations 7 12 suggest that in this mode of circulation that is driven both by temperature gradients and by salinity gradients the seepage velocity will be proportional to the horizontal temperature and salinity gradients that initiate the circulation section 5 3 below presents the results of the sensitivity analysis aimed to test this theoretical prediction 5 2 4 head effects similar to the effect of confinement changing the freshwater head on land can shift the system between the 3 different modes using our baseline simulation we changed the head between 20 30 and 40 m table 2 above and table s1 in the si fig s1 in the si shows the resulting circulation patterns high head fig s1a produces freshwater seepage as in the case of fig 6a above low head fig s1b produces pure seawater dsgd driven by geothermal convection same as fig 6b and the intermediate head fig s1c is the same simulation as the baseline presented above fig 6c above elevating the head to 40 m resulted in a fourfold increase in the seepage velocity compared to baseline simulation vsgd 0 4 m d and seepage was also less saline ssgd 83 table 2 lowering the head to 20 m caused the seepage velocity to decrease to 0 07 m d but it is seepage of pure seawater ssgd 100 table 2 5 3 sensitivity analysis using the baseline 1 simulation as a representative case for dsgd that is driven by thermo haline circulation a sensitivity analysis is carried out to test two factors of the hydrologic system applied as boundary conditions see section 3 3 for details 1 seawater salinity 2 seawater temperature a third factor the basal heat flux was also tested and showed negligible effect on the system and was thus excluded from this study the sensitivity analysis is meant to test the fit between the model results and the theory presented in section 4 eq 12 predicts that increasing the salinity and temperature gradients where the circulation is initiated will increase the seepage velocity vsgd and the correlation is expected to be linear fig 7 plots measured maximum seepage velocity from 11 different simulations whose conditions are given in table s1 in the supporting information versus the measured temperature and salinity gradients in these simulations which are then inserted as values into eq 12 the gradients were measured along a horizontal distance of 1 km in the aquifer at z 300 m which is 100 m below the seepage point fig 5 as predicted by theory vsgd linearly increases with temperature and salinity gradient following the mathematical form predicted by eq 12 however we do note 2 deviations from theory 1 the theoretical slope is 1 25 2 5 while the model yields a slope of 1 02 and 2 the y intercept of the straight line is b 0 1 and not zero as predicted by theory this will be further discussed below it is interesting to note that modeling results find that temperature changes open squares in fig 7 affect the seepage velocity about an order of magnitude less than the salinity changes closed squares this is because the thermal expansion coefficient is one quarter of the solutal one α and β in table 1 and because the temperature differences introduced in the system maximal δ t was 11 c are about one third of the salinity differences maximal δ s was 39 g kg 6 discussion the most important result of the present work is that under natural conditions steady state deep sgd of water with salinity lower than seawater is possible fig 5 this deep submarine seepage occurs under certain conditions in confined aquifers that are exposed to the sea the seepage is intense and focused within the narrow gap between the fstz and the top of the aquifer exposure modeled seepage velocities in the baseline simulation are around 0 1 m d in the baseline simulation the seepage salinity is slightly lower than seawater but in case of lower conductivity of the confining unit or elevated heads on land salinity may decrease dramatically see ssgd in table 2 an offshore exposure of a submarine confined aquifer produces an elongated and flattened fstz that is pushed seawards dsgd emerges as part of a dynamic steady state in a system where a direct underground hydrological connection exists between the land area of freshwater recharge and the deep sea area most previous models studying the hydrology of submarine confined aquifers did not assume confined aquifer exposure to the sea and instead imposed a no flow boundary between the aquifer and the sea hindering seepage e g bakker 2006 kooi and groen 2001 but this no flow boundary assumption is not always true in some cases the aquifer may be directly connected to the sea for example when canyons dissect the continental shelf cutting into the aquifer as in the asc here or when permeable faults cut through the confining layer and the aquifer as in monterey bay california breen and orange 1992 orange et al 2002 when the aquifer is exposed numerical simulations should use a constant seawater head boundary between the aquifer and the sea which according to our simulations may under some conditions push the fstz seawards and allow for intense seepage this conjecture is supported by the results of michael et al 2016 who used a constant head bc in models of heterogeneous submarine aquifers and found freshwater wedges reaching up to 50 km offshore this mechanism provides a possible explanation for the presence and seepage of fresh brackish groundwater in deep areas offshore in steady state conditions the other leading explanation for dsgd that of transient seepage due to hydrological relicts of a past lower sea level is likely suitable in many of the observed dsgd sites in the world post et al 2013 yet the steady state mechanism suggested in the current work may dominate in other places and also provide an alternative mechanism where the transient mechanism is unfeasible e g johnston 1983 an example of such a situation where our proposed dsgd mechanism may apply is given by the recent work of gustafson et al 2019 who find fresh water extending far offshore the eastern coast of the u s their conceptual model relates the seaward extension of a freshwater body to a basin ward dipping aquifer that encounters a monocline structure which forces the fresh water to flow upwards towards the seafloor it is likely that such a monocline is characterized by faulting at its peak exposing the aquifer to the sea and thus providing a situation similar to the scenario presented here where a steady state dsgd arises from the offshore exposure of a submarine confined aquifer the circulation within the confined aquifer and the character of the resulting dsgd as modeled here depend on the hydraulic conductivity of the confining layer above the aquifer as discussed in the next section 6 1 confinement and head effect on circulation mode our modeling results show that 3 modes of circulation arise in the exposed confined aquifer depending on the efficiency to which the aquifer is confined by the overlying aquitard dictated by the conductivity of the aquitard k c 1 in a poorly confined aquifer high k c the circulation mode resembles that of a phreatic aquifer as modeled by wilson 2005 a full separation occurs between two independent systems of sgd the deep sgd results from geothermal convection of pure seawater whereas the brackish fresh sgd is limited to the near shore scale and is the result of seawater circulation due to salinity gradients fig 6b 2 in a highly confined aquifer low k c the deep seepage is given by direct freshwater flow from the land to the deep seepage site fig 6a a spatially small convection cell develops where seawater is sucked in at the bottom part of the aquifer exposure driven by both thermal and salt dispersion effects the seawater spends a relatively short time in the aquifer 90 yr before it seeps out in the middle of the outcrop despite the small dimensions of the convection cell the relative amount of seawater sucked into the aquifer was high psc 0 7 meaning seawater accounts for about 40 of the total circulation this can be explained by the steep salinity gradients near the outcrop due to the extended fresh water wedge that lead to rapid circulation eq 10 this scenario of fresh dsgd from a confined submarine aquifer that is exposed offshore was already suggested and modeled by amir et al 2013 using an analysis of the onshore structure of a confined coastal aquifer in central israel in our present work the modeled fresh dsgd is based on a thorough study of both the onshore and the offshore structure of the aquifer additionally amir et al 2013 applied a very low conductivity of the confining unit 6 orders of magnitude lower than that of the aquifer here the conductivity difference is only 3 orders of magnitude and is based on realistic calibrated conductivities of the aquifer and the confining layers from the study area dafny et al 2010 kafri and kessler 2001 paldor et al 2019 3 between end members 1 and 2 an intermediate case was discovered that of brackish dsgd fig 6c in this scenario the transition zone between fresh and seawater the fstz reaches from the shore to the outcrop 15 km offshore and is quite thick here the two convection cells the thermally driven and the salinity driven unite creating an fstz that constitutes both a salinity boundary and a thermal boundary the spontaneous formation of a united salinity and thermal boundary layer within a convection cell was termed previously double diffusive convection e g bischoff and rosenbauer 1989 griffiths 1981 huppert and turner 1981 the thermo haline circulation that develops in the confined aquifer drives seawater into the aquifer where it mixes with freshwater through salt dispersion and then circulates back and seeps as brackish dsgd fig 6c this mechanism for brackish dsgd provides potentially important insights to the global research of the phenomenon for example lin et al 2010 used δ 18 o as a tracer for dsgd in the kaoping submarine canyon offshore taiwan the thermo haline mechanism implies that brackish dsgd might not bear the chemical signature of terrestrial water such as δ 18 o because even though it is not 100 seawater salinity it might comprise mostly seawater that recirculated in the confined aquifer and diluted via salt dispersion similar to the effect of aquifer confinement we found that increasing head on land also shifts the system between different modes of circulation elevating head on land is equivalent to lowering hydraulic conductivity of the confining unit fig s1 in the supporting information this result is rather intuitive the mode of circulation and seepage depends on the offshore extent of the freshwater tongue freshwater extends further offshore as it is pushed more effectively either by capping the aquifer efficiently or by increasing the driving head there are other factors in the modeled hydrologic system that are expected to affect the mode of circulation such as aquifer geometry flexural vs horizontal aquifer exposure length i e the length of the subsea outcrop aquifer conductivity and more these factors are beyond the scope of the present study and merit further work 6 2 fit between theory and model both the theoretical calculations section 4 and the numerical model fig 7 predict a linear correlation between seepage velocity and temperature and salinity horizontal gradients according to the theory the slope of the linear fit is expected to be between 1 25 and 2 5 eq 12 while in the numerical simulations it was 1 02 for such complex hydrological systems over such large scales a 25 150 error is a very good quantitative fit between the theory and the model if for example the theory is used to predict the aquifer conductivity based on measured gradients and seepage velocity then the theory would predict an aquifer conductivity of 50 100 m d instead of the actual 40 m d again for such large scale hydrological systems this is a very good approximation as noted in fig 7 the y intercept of the equation relating between the developed gradients and the seepage velocity was not zero as predicted by the theory this is due to the fact that at some point a further decrease of gradients pushing the fstz landwards suppressed the circulation and the seeps so the system transitioned to a different flow regime this effect is not captured in the theoretical calculations presented in section 4 in regards to the thermo haline circulation that produces dsgd the seepage velocity depends on temperature changes much less than it depends on the salinity ones this is revealed by comparing the variations in vsgd that arise due to changes in temperature gradients open squares in fig 7 vs those that arise from salinity changes closed squares salinity variations altered the seepage velocity in the range of 0 05 0 3 m d while temperature changes caused the seepage velocity to shift between 0 12 and 0 15 m d this can also be theoretically calculated for a given δ x when looking at the two terms in eq 12 α t x β s x in the simulation with the highest thermal contrast between seawater and terrestrial water the temperature difference was δ t 9 c so the thermal term is approximately α δ t δ x 1 8 10 3 δ x 1 m in contrast the highest salinity difference between seawater and terrestrial water was δ s 39 g k g so the haline term is β δ s δ x 3 1 10 2 δ x 1 m i e 17 times larger than the thermal term kurylyk et al 2018 demonstrated the limitations of using thermal signatures to track sgd and suggested that sub surface salt domes in the scotian slope reverse the subsea groundwater circulation thus reversing the expected thermal profile across the slope the present work supports this suggestion as both the model and theoretical calculations predict that salinity differences dominate the circulation patterns while temperature profiles might be dictated by the circulation and are not necessarily responsible for it 6 3 implications for the study area the modeling study presented above suggests that submarine groundwater discharge of either fresh or brackish groundwater should be expected in the achziv submarine canyon asc fig 1 indeed numerous independent observations point to the presence of relatively fresh pore water at the bottom of the asc 1 rubin blum et al 2014 found bacteria typical of the vicinity of hydrothermal vents iron oxidizing zetaprteobacteria in various places in the continental margin of israel among them achziv canyon they link the presence of this community in the sediments to pore water upward flux 2 at the asc bottlenose dolphins tursiops truncatus are anomalously abundant compared to other areas in the eastern mediterranean suggesting it is a zone of high biologic production elasar et al 2013 3 recent hydrographic surveys in the asc point that indeed there is a plume of low salinity anomaly close to the seafloor right at the submarine outcrop of the judea group aquifer paldor et al phd hebrew university of jerusalem 2019 4 our previous modeling work of the asc and the hydrology of the study area also suggested dsgd this work was validated using data from water wells in the western galilee area paldor et al 2019 7 conclusions 1 coastal confined aquifers may provide a connection between the land recharge of freshwater and deep sea areas if they are exposed in the deep sea via canyon incision or faults such exposure allows for formation of large hydrological circulation cells and deep submarine discharge 2 in such cases the conventional no flow boundary condition which is often used to model coastal confined aquifers must be exchanged with a free surface boundary condition constant head in order to capture the emerging sgd and fresh water wedge offshore 3 the character of the dsgd fresh brackish saltwater and the mode of the circulation thermal haline thermo haline depend on the degree of aquifer confinement i e the hydraulic conductivity of the aquitard overlying the aquifer on head on land and on other parameters that still need to be studied aquifer geometry conductivity aquifer outcrop length 4 while coastal phreatic aquifers may develop 2 circulation cells the first density driven near the shore and the other thermally driven on the shelf a confined exposed aquifer may develop a single thermo haline circulation cell that unites the two and drives brackish dsgd 5 in that case the seepage velocity is linearly correlated to the thermal and haline horizontal gradients that develop in the confined aquifer at the outcrop area where the circulation is initiated declaration of competing interest the
