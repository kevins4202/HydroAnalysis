2535,forecasting floods is an effective non engineering measure for flood control however for urbanized regions the lack of drainage data and complex underlying surface conditions make flood forecasting extremely difficult this paper proposes a framework for urban flood modeling in data poor regions to address these issues the drainage capacity of the pipe system was represented by the constant infiltration rate which was calibrated by coupling satellite soil moisture product and measured flood data to better reflect real drainage conditions subsequently given the complex underlying surface conditions this framework divides the land use cover into several dominant urban land use types which were assigned unique runoff generation and flow confluence parameters in urbanized regions the framework also takes the impact of dense buildings on water flow into consideration a building treatment method for structured grids was proposed which can consider the anisotropy of buildings and scale of the grid the results showed that it is feasible to estimate drainage capacity using the constant infiltration approach and the process of soil infiltration is crucial for urban flood forecasting compared with the highest resolution publicly available land use cover dataset the urban land use types extracted from high resolution remote sensing images can reveal the runoff generation and flow confluence mechanism more accurately in urbanized regions this study verified the necessity of considering the impact of buildings in urban flood modeling the building treatment method of this framework can identify synergistic effects of local terrain and building boundaries on water flow the results provide a reference for effective flood forecasting in urban regions with poor data keywords data poor urban flood modeling drainage capacity land use cover building treatment data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction over the past few decades the trend of increasing population sizes of cities has resulted in rapid urbanization saksena et al 2020 urbanization is usually accompanied by rapid land use cover succession resulting in increased runoff volume and peak flow as well as reduced time to peak liu et al 2005 saghafian et al 2007 suriya and mudgal 2012 making urban flooding more frequent and severe defries and eshleman 2004 jongman 2018 shao et al 2020 reliable and accurate flood forecasting can effectively reduce losses associated with urban flood disasters and provide an opportunity to prepare for disaster management wang et al 2019 however the prediction accuracy of urban flood models depends largely on the integrity of the basic data and detailed depiction of complex underlying surface conditions bruwier et al 2020 zhao et al 2019 accurate representation of infiltration in permeable areas and the drainage capacity of pipe systems is important for urban flood modeling leandro et al 2016 unfortunately drainage pipe system data are unavailable in many urban regions due to the loss of such data over time where most drainage pipes were installed decades ago kratt et al 2020 li et al 2020 or to the data not being publicly available due to confidentiality agreements wang et al 2018 some studies have proposed generalization methods for estimating drainage capacity in regions without drainage pipe system data chen et al 2009 used a constant infiltration method and design rainfall reduction 1 in 2 year rainfall return period to represent urban drainage pipe capacity over their entire study area the environment agency 2013 in bristol uk represented the capacity of underground pipe systems by reducing the design rainfall rate by 6 20 mm h over the whole area yu and coulthard 2015 assumed that the drainage system conveys water at maximum capacity in the whole study area for the corresponding rainfall return period all of these approaches assumed that the drainage pipe system conveys water in the whole area at maximum capacity corresponding to the rainfall return period however drainage pipe systems have generally been in operation for a long time and their drainage capacity tends to be limited to some extent guerineau et al 2014 rutsch et al 2008 there is a certain degree of error in the drainage capacity under the design conditions used in real urban flood modeling and the drainage capacity should be calibrated for accuracy moreover the number of drainage pipe manholes varies between urban land use types resulting in different drainage capacities such that the same value cannot be used to represent the drainage capacity of the entire urban area wang et al 2018 used constant infiltration rates hereinafter referred to as cirs in the ranges of 25 50 and 15 40 mm h to describe the total drainage capacity including soil infiltration and pipe drainage of green space and urban areas respectively the simulation accuracy was best when the total drainage capacities of green space and urban areas were 50 and 40 mm h respectively their study only classified the urbanized areas into two types i e impervious surfaces and green spaces to illustrate the differences in drainage capacity furthermore as the initial soil moisture content has a marked influence on the infiltration rate fidal and kjeldsen 2020 horton 1933 houser 2005 morin and benyamini 1977 philip 1957 st√§hli et al 1999 combining the infiltration of the permeable area and drainage capacity of the pipe system together cannot accurately describe the mass loss of water and it is necessary to describe the process of soil infiltration separately however setting the initial soil water content is difficult when analyzing the soil infiltration process as only a few measurements of soil moisture are available for most urban regions with the continuous progress in remote sensing technology some high precision satellite soil moisture products have been developed babaeian et al 2019 and successfully applied to construct hydrological models crow et al 2017 yan and moradkhani 2016 while the satellite soil moisture products have never been used for urban flood modeling in data poor regions another important factor to take into consideration in urban flood modeling is the influence of dense buildings on water flow numerous studies have shown that buildings have a significant impact on urban floods chen et al 2012 fewtrell et al 2008 neal et al 2011 there are four major building treatment methods used in urban flood modeling the building block bb method building hole bh method building resistance br method and building parameter bp method in the bb method buildings are modeled by raising the local topography to the roof level brown et al 2007 the bh method considers building footprints as the calculation boundaries for inundation modeling gallegos et al 2009 the bb and bh methods are mainly applicable to unstructured grids with high resolution digital elevation model dem datasets schubert et al 2008 however for coarse structured grids which cannot be adaptively adjusted to fit building boundaries there is a large degree of generalization when bb and bh methods are applied the br method specifies a very high local roughness in cells occupied by buildings to compensate for the effects of buildings on surface flows however in many cases no objective criteria are used to set the high roughness chen et al 2012 shen et al 2018 with the bp method the building coverage ratio bcr and conveyance reduction factor crf are used to describe the effects of buildings on flow and the method is therefore applicable to urban modeling with coarser dem grids schubert and sanders 2012 sanders et al 2008 proposed a simplified scalar formulation based on the vegetation drag literature to represent the resistance of buildings which they applied to a porosity model that can consider the anisotropy of buildings however for application of the bp method attention should be paid to the relationship between grid size and building scale when the width of the building is equal to the grid size the flood will flow around rather than into or through buildings unless their entrances are left open or the water level exceeds the crest height of any entrances chen et al 2012 jiang et al 2022 shen et al 2018 therefore the aim of this paper is to propose a framework that includes the acquisition of data and detailed characterization of runoff generation and confluence for urban flood modeling in data poor regions using information from multiple sources the following three questions are addressed in this paper 1 how to reasonably generalize the drainage capacity without the pipe system data 2 how to describe the characteristics of runoff generation and confluence accurately in urbanized regions when the high resolution land use cover datasets are not available 3 how to consider the effect of dense buildings on the water flow when there is a lack of high resolution dem dataset to resolve the problem of the paucity of drainage system data the drainage capacity of the pipe system was represented using a cir which was calibrated by coupling satellite soil moisture product and measured flood data to better reflect real drainage conditions moreover an attempt was made to set different cir based on the impervious rates of various land use types to reflect the differences among drainage capacities this framework divides land use cover into several dominant urban land use types which are assigned unique runoff generation and flow confluence parameters in urbanized regions in addition a building treatment method for structured grids was proposed to reflect the impact of buildings on water flow which can consider the anisotropy of buildings and scale of the grid finally the proposed framework was applied to reproduce real flood events in an urban region of 1 2 km2 to determine the effectiveness for urban flood forecasting in data poor urbanized regions 2 study area and data sets 2 1 study area this study was performed in an urban catchment with an area of 1 2 km2 located in the northern part of haizhu district guangzhou china within the campus of sun yat sen university fig 1 due to the nature of the surrounding borders the entire study area is relatively independent of outside influences therefore it was assumed that there was no surface water exchange between the study area and surrounding areas except for the outgoing discharge from the drainage pipe system 2 2 distributed data elevation data were measured at nearly 5 800 points and used to generate the dem of the study area with a spatial resolution of 10 m fig 2 a two types of land use cover data were used in this study the first were derived based on urban land use cover classifications used in previous research liu et al 2017 where the study area was subdivided into eight major land use types commercial service office space unutilized land green space water low density residential high density residential and road according to visual interpretation of high resolution remote sensing images and satellite maps such as google satellite map https www gditu net hereinafter referred to as the udt dataset fig 1c the second type of data were from the highest resolution land use cover dataset publicly available which was published by the gong peng team of tsinghua university spatial resolution of 10 m gong et al 2019 from glc10 dataset https data ess tsinghua edu cn fig 2b the soil type data were derived from the hwsd global database nachtergaele et al 2010 website https www fao org soils portal soil survey soil maps and databases harmonized world soil database v12 en as the study region was classified as urban in this database and there were no effective soil parameters for calculation the thickness of soil layer and the content of sand silt and clay the soil type cn11483 loam closest to the study region for which effective soil parameters were available was selected fig 2c the values of soil related parameters are shown in table 1 among them the saturated hydraulic conductivity was calculated based on the content of sand silt and clay using the soil hydraulic characteristics calculator proposed by arya et al 1981 the infiltration damping coefficient was calculated using a formula described previously based on the saturated hydraulic conductivity wang et al 2019 the soil porosity was assigned a value based on the topsoil usda texture classification in the literature wang et al 2019 the building boundary data were derived from bigmap https www bigemap com and the geometric position information of the building features was corrected manually based on google remote sensing images fig 1c 2 3 hydrological data in this study three flood events that occurred on 24 june 2019 22 july 2019 and 29 july 2019 were used to calibrate and validate the model the water level data were radio electronic water level meter observation data the main characteristics of these three flood events are shown in table 2 the rainfall data were obtained from an automatic precipitation station in the study area with a time resolution of 5 min given the relatively small study area of 1 2 km2 and considering that precipitation is often assumed to be spatially uniform in small catchments david et al 1995 einfalt et al 2004 we used the rainfall at a single point to represent the entire study area berne et al 2004 cao et al 2020 the initial soil water content data were from the soil moisture active passive smap mission level 4 surface and root zone soil moisture l4 sm product https nsidc org data smap smap data html which is the most accurate global scale soil moisture product babaeian et al 2019 the detailed values for the most recent product that ahead of the flood event are shown in table 3 among them the top layer soil wetness 0 5 cm was used to represent the initial soil moisture content of the entire soil layer hossain anni et al 2020 2 4 methodology an overview of the proposed framework for urban flood modeling in data poor regions is presented in fig 3 the framework includes several steps which are briefly explained below 2 5 urban flood prediction model in the urban flood prediction model proposed by wang et al 2019 the momentum equation of saint venant was used to estimate outflow velocity under heavy precipitation due to the small grid size and short time steps it is reasonable to assume that the surface water flow within the grid cell and to its neighboring grid cells is steady and uniform bates and de roo 2000 chen et al 2011 rujner et al 2018 wang and chen 2019 specifically steady indicates no temporal variation in water velocity i e u t 0 while uniform denotes no spatial variation in water velocity i e u x 0 subsequently the flow direction is determined according to the instantaneous height sum of water depth and grid elevation of the grid so the model can capture the reverse flow phenomenon in flat urban areas due to uneven rainfall during large storms or blockage by local obstructions the calculation formula is as follows g s h x c d u 2 h where g is the acceleration due to gravity at a rate of 9 8 m s2 s sin Œ∏ represents the bottom slope Œ∏ unit is the bottom slope angle for a slice of river channel defined by dx h represents the water depth unit m h x represents the water depth at the deepest point for a slice of the river channel defined by dx unit m which varies with location u is the water velocity unit m s and c d is the drag coefficient in the river channel the infiltration curve method is applied to runoff generation as the surface of an urbanized region will have undergone a great deal of modification the runoff generation rate is raised as impervious surface increased guan et al 2015 oudin et al 2018 hence the model uses an impermeability parameter to reflect rapid runoff generation in urbanized regions r t r t 1 p t r t 1 r t 1 where r t unit m represents the remaining surface water depth of the grid cell at time t without consideration of infiltration and drainage of pipe system r t 1 unit m represents the water depth of the grid cell at time t 1 p t unit m represents the precipitation of the grid cell at time t r t 1 unit m and r t 1 unit m represent the water depth of inflow and outflow of the grid cell from t 1 to t respectively considering that infiltration is a relatively slow process compared to the rapid surface runoff caused by intense rainfall during a flooding event thus the model assumed that the infiltrated water from t 1 to t only comes from the remaining surface water at time t in other words infiltration only takes place instantaneously at time t r t r t r t 1 i m p e Œ≤ m d r a where r t unit m represents the final surface water depth of the grid cell at time t i m p dimensionless represents the impervious rate coefficient of the grid cell Œ≤ dimensionless is a damping coefficient describing the decreasing rate of infiltration due to the increase in soil moisture m represents the soil moisture content and d r a unit m represents the drainage capacity of the grid cell from t 1 to t notably we improved this model rather than applying it directly the original model represented the drainage capacity of the pipe system according to the cir and assumed that different land use types have the same drainage capacity which is different from the actual drainage process in this study the cir was assigned different values to represent the differences in drainage capacity of different types of urban land use cover moreover the influence of buildings on water flow was not considered in the urban flood prediction model in this study a building treatment method that considers the anisotropy of buildings and grid scale was embedded in the model to reflect the effects of dense buildings on water flow in urban regions in order to ensure model convergence it is necessary to make sure that a particle of water entering a grid cell would not travel through it until a computation step within the model has been completed wang et al 2019 a calculation time step of 0 5 s used in this study was verified a detailed description of the methods and parameter settings is presented in sections 3 2 3 4 2 6 model parameter settings and drainage capacity representation the parameters of the two types of land use cover data are shown in tables 4 and 5 the impervious rate parameter was determined with reference to previous research cao et al 2020 choi et al 2019 son and kwon 2022 wang et al 2019 parameter c d was assigned a value based on the corresponding impervious rate in the literature wang et al 2019 to set the cir we used the smap l4 product to determine the initial soil water content and used the flood event on july 22 2019 to determine the most appropriate value according to the average nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient of the simulation results as the drainage capacities vary among land uses cover types in urban regions we made a simple assumption that the cir changes linearly with the impervious rate the land use type with higher impervious rate has more manholes of drainage pipe resulting in greater drainage capacity 2 7 building treatment method sanders et al 2008 proposed a simplified scalar formulation to represent the impact of buildings on water flow and showed that the building resistance in a grid can be directly superimposed on the drag coefficient c d in the river channel as the resistance coefficient of the total grid the formulation of building resistance is as follows c d b 1 2 c d 0 a h where c d b represents the building resistance c d 0 is a dimensionless drag coefficient 2 in this study as given by sanders et al 2008 a represents the width of the obstacle perpendicular to the direction of the water flow per unit plane area and h represents the water depth of the grid as the resistance formula was proposed for a porosity model with a larger grid size the scale relationship between the buildings and grids should be considered when applying this formula to the urban flood prediction model previous studies have suggested that when the projected width of a building is equal to the grid size the water flows around rather than into or through the building without considering the water storage effects chen et al 2012 shen et al 2018 hence three cases were considered to restrict the flow confluence patterns in this study fig 4 case 1 parallel outflow directions b d f and h when the projected width of any building in the grid is equal to the c e l l s i z e the grid is impermeable in this direction and the water flows in the direction of the lowest instantaneous height excluding this direction fig 4a case 2 diagonal outflow directions c e g and i when the projected width of any building in the grid is equal to 2 c e l l s i z e the grid is impermeable in this direction and the water flows in the direction of the lowest instantaneous height excluding this direction fig 4b case 3 diagonal outflow directions c e g and i as the calculation of diagonal outflow also depends on the instantaneous heights on both sides of the grid wang et al 2019 for diagonal outflow directions we added an additional scenario to the restriction of the projected width of buildings on the water flow fig 4c in which the instantaneous height of adjacent grids such as grids b and d of the building diagonal flow is higher than the current grid such as grid a and there are buildings at this bearing angle such as the buildings in grid a or c in general the influence of buildings on water flow was divided into two types in this study and the formula of flow confluence is as follows g s h x c d c d b u 2 h w a t e r f l o w s i n a n o t h e r d i r e c t i o n w i t h t h e l o w e s t i n s t a n t a n e o u s h e i g h t i f p a r a l l e l f l o w w p i c e l l s i z e o r d i a g o n a l f l o w w p i 2 c e l l s i z e i f p a r a l l e l f l o w w p i c e l l s i z e o r d i a g o n a l f l o w w p i 2 c e l l s i z e o r t h e s p e c i a l s c e n a r i o o f d i a g o n a l f l o w where w p i unit m represents the projected width of any building in the grid in a certain flow direction and c e l l s i z e unit m represents the width of the grid 2 8 treatment of water flow on building roofs another common challenge when modeling urban flooding is the impact of the roofs of buildings on rainfall runoff processes due to a lack of information on the roof drainage system bruwier et al 2020 adopted a simple conceptual approach to water flow on building roofs in an idealized study assuming that at every time step all rainfall on the roof of a given building is drained instantaneously and transferred to surface flow in cells corresponding to the vertices of the building s footprint however actual buildings have various shapes and it is difficult to capture their vertices therefore in this study we divided the existing building grids into two categories fig 5 in the first category the proportion of building area relative to the grid area is 100 grid a and the rainfall on the roof will be instantly transferred to the grid for surface flow computation in the second category the building area accounts for 100 of the grid area grid b as water flow on the roof should be drained as soon as possible we assumed that the total amount of rainfall on the building roof at every time step will be instantaneously and evenly transferred to the nearest surface grid that has a building area to grid area ratio of 100 in addition it should be noted that the water flow from adjacent grids cannot pass through the grid b 2 9 evaluation of modeling accuracy to quantitatively analyze models constructed under different scenarios the n s e coefficient and maximum inundation depth relative error r e p were used to quantify the difference in flood process between the actual and simulated values the error indicators were formulated as follows n s e 1 t 1 n q t o b s q t s i m 2 t 1 n q t o b s q o b s 2 where q t o b s is the observed value at time t q t s i m is the simulated value at time t n is the number of observed values and q o b s is the average value of the observation series r e p q p o b s q p s i m q p o b s 100 where q p o b s represents an observed value of maximum inundation depth and q p s i m represents a simulated value of flood peak maximum inundation depth 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of different drainage capacity representations three scenarios were tested to explore the effects of different drainage system representations on model accuracy 1 drainage capacity scenario 1 the soil infiltration and drainage capacity of the pipe system were combined and expressed using a total cir the initial soil water content was set for 100 in other words the cir includes the infiltration and drainage capacity of the pipe system 2 drainage capacity scenario 2 soil infiltration was calculated separately and the cir only represented the drainage capacity of the pipe system the value of which was the same for different land use cover types the initial soil water content was set by the corresponding satellite soil moisture product and the infiltration curve method was applied to calculate soil infiltration processes 3 drainage capacity scenario 3 cir only represents the drainage capacity of the pipe system and the cir values were set differently for different land use cover types fig 6 shows the calibration results of the cir under different scenarios the results showed that model accuracy was best with a cir of 80 10 and 20 mm h in drainage capacity scenarios 1 3 respectively drainage capacity scenarios 1 3 were used to construct urban flooding models with suitable values of cir two remaining flood events were simulated and verified and two indicators i e n s e and r e p were used to evaluate the simulation of the remaining flood events the simulation error statistics of the different drainage scenarios are shown in table 6 according to the comparison of drainage capacity scenarios 1 and 2 the simulation accuracy was similar for building 572 for the e20190624 flood event but the n s e and r e p were improved for the e20190729 flood event at fengsheng hall and huangchuanjing hall although the same cir was set for different land use types after calculating the soil infiltration separately the n s e and r e p of fengsheng hall improved from 0 717 and 34 550 to 0 747 and 5 834 respectively while the n s e and r e p of huangchuanjing hall improved from 0 812 and 72 858 to 0 620 and 10 185 respectively further comparison of the simulation results of drainage capacity scenarios 2 and 3 showed that at each waterlogging point both the n s e and r e p were greatly improved by setting different cir values for different land use types in general drainage capacity scenario 3 outperformed the other two scenarios as it had the highest multiple waterlogging point nse value and lowest r e p fig 7 shows the flood processes for simulations conducted under different scenarios the flood process simulated by drainage capacity scenario 1 was mainly characterized by rapid flood rises and declines while the flooding processes simulated by drainage capacity scenarios 2 and 3 were gentler reflecting the decrease in permeability with increasing soil infiltration the manholes of drainage pipes are usually set on impervious surfaces such as roads aichele and andresen 2013 li et al 2020 and the impervious rates differ among various urban land types cao et al 2020 choi et al 2019 son and kwon 2022 wang et al 2019 this leads to differences in the drainage capacity of urban land types as shown in fig 7 the flood processes simulated by drainage capacity scenarios 2 and 3 were quite different especially for building 572 which lacks calibration flood measurements fig 7a this indicated that more attention should be paid to the differences in drainage capacity among various urban land types when there is a lack of measured information drainage capacity scenario 1 could also refer to a case where the soil water content is saturated and only the drainage capacity of the pipe system is considered according to the simulation results it is infeasible to fully consider surface runoff generation and to treat the infiltration rate as zero in urban flood modeling without considering the initial soil water content the initial soil water content should be set carefully as this is crucial for the simulation of flood processes hossain anni et al 2020 the satellite soil moisture product can be used as a reference value when setting the initial soil moisture content in data poor regions notably as this study used a framework that can be applied in any data poor urban region we adopted the global scale smap l4 soil moisture product however for practical use some datasets with higher spatial and temporal resolution can be applied such as those for china li et al 2022 and the usa karthikeyan and mishra 2021 3 2 effects of different land use cover classification datasets the from glc10 dataset is the highest resolution publicly available land use cover dataset with conventional classification types we used it to reconstruct an urban flood model under drainage capacity scenario 3 as the parameters of runoff generation and flow confluence differ among land use cover datasets the cir was recalibrated using the e20190722 flood event to eliminate the influence of drainage capacity on the results the calibration results of the cir constructed by the from glc10 dataset are shown in fig 8 a cir value of 60 mm h was best for the model constructed with the from glc10 dataset this value was quite different from that obtained when using the urban land use type dataset the simulation errors of the models constructed with different land use cover datasets are shown in table 7 the simulated results were poor when using the from glc10 dataset the indicators n s e and r e p of building 572 fengsheng hall and huangchuanjing hall simulated using the from glc10 dataset were 1 328 0 748 and 0 145 and 54 508 10 702 and 42 050 respectively the n s e and r e p of the flood simulation with the udt dataset were markedly improved fig 9 shows the flood processes for simulations using different land use cover datasets fig 10 shows the differences in spatial impervious rates between the udt and from glc10 datasets the impervious rate of the udt dataset was higher than that of the from glc10 dataset in the higher elevation areas surrounding building 572 while the impervious rate of the udt dataset was lower than that of the from glc10 dataset in the areas surrounding huangchuanjing hall these observations were consistent with the flood processes shown in fig 9 the water depths of building 572 simulated with the udt dataset were greater than those simulated with the from glc10 dataset while the opposite was true for the flood processes at huangchuanjing hall for fengsheng hall as the impervious rate of the udt dataset in the surrounding area was slightly lower than that of the from glc10 dataset the water depths simulated by the udt dataset were slightly lower than those simulated using the from glc10 dataset at the initial stage of flood rise subsequently the simulated water depths based on the udt dataset gradually exceeded those based on the from glc10 dataset as the water volume of building 572 gradually flowed into fengsheng hall the results also demonstrated that the highest resolution land use cover dataset publicly available with common classification types cannot describe the characteristics of runoff generation and confluence accurately in urbanized regions compared with natural watersheds the hydrological characteristics of urban regions show greater spatial heterogeneity due to the diverse underlying surface composition and complex microtopography cao et al 2020 in urban regions some permeable surfaces like permeable paving and slender green belts cannot be captured in detail by conventional land classification systems with a resolution of 10 m li et al 2019 schulman and peters 2007 notably parameter homogenization occurs when setting the same parameter values for the same urban land use types when classifying urban land use types it is necessary to ensure that runoff generation and confluence parameters are roughly the same for each land use type to avoid overestimating the runoff generation for permeable surfaces and underestimating it for impervious surfaces more refined land use cover data are required to obtain better model simulation results hu et al 2021 kokkonen et al 2019 li and bortolot 2022 in general in data poor regions high resolution remote sensing images and satellite maps can be used to obtain accurate land use type data through visual interpretation which more accurately captures runoff generation and confluence parameters in urbanized regions 3 3 effects of different building treatment methods three scenarios were constructed to explore the impacts of building treatment methods on simulation results 1 building treatment scenario 1 without considering the influence of buildings on water flow 2 building treatment scenario 2 introducing the resistance formula proposed by sanders et al 2008 in addition we also considered the redistribution of water flow on the building roofs to ensure that the rainfall entering the grid is consistent with building treatment scenario 3 in other words this scenario is like a combination of the bb and bp methods the water flow from adjacent grids cannot pass through the grid b the building area accounts for 100 of the grid area while the influence on water velocity was only considered when the water flow from adjacent grids passes through grid a the proportion of building area relative to the grid area is 100 3 building treatment scenario 3 introducing the resistance formula with restriction of water flow and considering the redistribution of water flow on the building roofs the restricting effect of building projected width on water flow was further considered for the grid a concomitantly to eliminate the influence of drainage capacity on the model results the cir was recalibrated based on the e20190722 flood event fig 11 shows the calibration results of the cir under building treatment scenario 2 which indicated that model accuracy was best with a cir value of 20 mm h as it is necessary to consider buildings in urban flood modeling we also selected 20 mm h as the cir for building treatment scenario 1 to prevent any influence of drainage capacity on the model results table 8 and fig 12 show the error statistics and flood processes for different building treatment methods respectively comparison of the simulation accuracy of building treatment scenarios 1 and 2 showed that the n s e of building 572 fengsheng hall and huangchuanjing hall improved from 0 042 0 738 and 0 689 to 0 374 0 845 and 0 714 respectively with the introduction of the building resistance formula with the exception of huangchuanjing hall the r e p indicator was slightly smaller in building treatment scenario 1 than building treatment scenario 2 r e p could be significantly reduced by introducing the building resistance formula at building 572 and fengsheng hall in the comparison of the results of building treatment scenarios 2 and 3 the n s e of building 572 fengsheng hall and huangchuanjing hall increased by 0 241 0 001 and 0 02 respectively with the addition of water flow restriction to the resistance formula the addition of restriction to the resistance formula had little effect on r e p for fengsheng hall and huangchuanjing hall but adding restriction to the resistance formula significantly reduced r e p for building 572 by 22 713 to further explore the reasons for the differences in simulation results among the building treatment methods the local terrain elevations of the three observation sites were extracted as shown in fig 13 the local depression of building 572 is formed by the local topography and building boundaries fig 13a this study used dem data which contain only basic terrain information without consideration of the elevation of building failure to account for the existence of building 572 results in water flow directly downstream of building 572 which prevents an increase in the water depth fig 12a in addition although the impermeability was considered for the grid b and the outflow velocity was retarded by the introduction of the building resistance formula grid a the water flow would also directly downstream of building 572 as the water depth rose fig 13b it is also necessary to pay consider impermeability according to the characteristics of the buildings and grid scale for the girds which have a building area to grid area ratio of 100 as local depressions are low lying parts of the surrounding terrain at fengsheng hall and huangchuanjing hall fig 13c d the water level would rise without considering the buildings but adding the resistance formula with water flow restriction improved the results 4 conclusions this paper proposed a framework for urban flood modeling in regions with imperfect drainage pipe systems land use cover and dem datasets the urban flood prediction model was modified and applied to an urban region of 1 2 km2 the main findings can be summarized as follows 1 for urban flood modeling without pipe system data it is possible to estimate drainage capacity using the cir however the soil infiltration and pipe system cannot be combined and represented by cir it is not possible to fully consider surface runoff generation and the infiltration rate should not be treated as zero without considering the initial soil water content in addition it should be noted that in the absence of measured information more attention should be paid to the differences in drainage capacity among various urban land types the simulation accuracy can be improved by setting different cir values for various land cover types the initial water content should be set carefully for accurate simulation of flood processes the satellite soil moisture product can be used as a reference when setting the initial soil moisture content for data poor regions 2 the model simulations with the urban land use types can better reflect the temporal variations of flood depths as displayed in the observations moreover the highest resolution land use cover dataset publicly available with common classification types cannot describe the characteristics of runoff generation and confluence accurately in urbanized regions when high resolution land use cover datasets 10 m are not available high resolution remote sensing images and satellite maps can be used to obtain high precision urban land use data through visual interpretation 3 it is necessary to consider the impacts of buildings in urban flood modeling where the simulation results are closely related to topographic data model simulation accuracy can be improved to some extent by introducing the water flow resistance formula but this approach cannot identify impermeability according to the characteristics of buildings and grid scale for the girds that have a building area to grid area ratio of 100 in this study the simulation accuracy was further improved by restricting the pattern of water flow confluence this paper improves the understanding of urban flood processes and helps the decision making in flood risk management for data poor regions nonetheless this study only considered the differences in drainage capacity of different urban land use types corresponding to the impervious rate without considering other factors e g the degree of maintenance of pipe system further study should consider various factors to carry out a more detailed differential allocation of drainage capacity for different land use types furthermore the study area is a small urbanized region of 1 2 km2 which can be easily visually interpreted using remote sensing images and satellite maps however the workload of visual interpretation is increasing as the expanding of the study region more automated

2535,forecasting floods is an effective non engineering measure for flood control however for urbanized regions the lack of drainage data and complex underlying surface conditions make flood forecasting extremely difficult this paper proposes a framework for urban flood modeling in data poor regions to address these issues the drainage capacity of the pipe system was represented by the constant infiltration rate which was calibrated by coupling satellite soil moisture product and measured flood data to better reflect real drainage conditions subsequently given the complex underlying surface conditions this framework divides the land use cover into several dominant urban land use types which were assigned unique runoff generation and flow confluence parameters in urbanized regions the framework also takes the impact of dense buildings on water flow into consideration a building treatment method for structured grids was proposed which can consider the anisotropy of buildings and scale of the grid the results showed that it is feasible to estimate drainage capacity using the constant infiltration approach and the process of soil infiltration is crucial for urban flood forecasting compared with the highest resolution publicly available land use cover dataset the urban land use types extracted from high resolution remote sensing images can reveal the runoff generation and flow confluence mechanism more accurately in urbanized regions this study verified the necessity of considering the impact of buildings in urban flood modeling the building treatment method of this framework can identify synergistic effects of local terrain and building boundaries on water flow the results provide a reference for effective flood forecasting in urban regions with poor data keywords data poor urban flood modeling drainage capacity land use cover building treatment data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction over the past few decades the trend of increasing population sizes of cities has resulted in rapid urbanization saksena et al 2020 urbanization is usually accompanied by rapid land use cover succession resulting in increased runoff volume and peak flow as well as reduced time to peak liu et al 2005 saghafian et al 2007 suriya and mudgal 2012 making urban flooding more frequent and severe defries and eshleman 2004 jongman 2018 shao et al 2020 reliable and accurate flood forecasting can effectively reduce losses associated with urban flood disasters and provide an opportunity to prepare for disaster management wang et al 2019 however the prediction accuracy of urban flood models depends largely on the integrity of the basic data and detailed depiction of complex underlying surface conditions bruwier et al 2020 zhao et al 2019 accurate representation of infiltration in permeable areas and the drainage capacity of pipe systems is important for urban flood modeling leandro et al 2016 unfortunately drainage pipe system data are unavailable in many urban regions due to the loss of such data over time where most drainage pipes were installed decades ago kratt et al 2020 li et al 2020 or to the data not being publicly available due to confidentiality agreements wang et al 2018 some studies have proposed generalization methods for estimating drainage capacity in regions without drainage pipe system data chen et al 2009 used a constant infiltration method and design rainfall reduction 1 in 2 year rainfall return period to represent urban drainage pipe capacity over their entire study area the environment agency 2013 in bristol uk represented the capacity of underground pipe systems by reducing the design rainfall rate by 6 20 mm h over the whole area yu and coulthard 2015 assumed that the drainage system conveys water at maximum capacity in the whole study area for the corresponding rainfall return period all of these approaches assumed that the drainage pipe system conveys water in the whole area at maximum capacity corresponding to the rainfall return period however drainage pipe systems have generally been in operation for a long time and their drainage capacity tends to be limited to some extent guerineau et al 2014 rutsch et al 2008 there is a certain degree of error in the drainage capacity under the design conditions used in real urban flood modeling and the drainage capacity should be calibrated for accuracy moreover the number of drainage pipe manholes varies between urban land use types resulting in different drainage capacities such that the same value cannot be used to represent the drainage capacity of the entire urban area wang et al 2018 used constant infiltration rates hereinafter referred to as cirs in the ranges of 25 50 and 15 40 mm h to describe the total drainage capacity including soil infiltration and pipe drainage of green space and urban areas respectively the simulation accuracy was best when the total drainage capacities of green space and urban areas were 50 and 40 mm h respectively their study only classified the urbanized areas into two types i e impervious surfaces and green spaces to illustrate the differences in drainage capacity furthermore as the initial soil moisture content has a marked influence on the infiltration rate fidal and kjeldsen 2020 horton 1933 houser 2005 morin and benyamini 1977 philip 1957 st√§hli et al 1999 combining the infiltration of the permeable area and drainage capacity of the pipe system together cannot accurately describe the mass loss of water and it is necessary to describe the process of soil infiltration separately however setting the initial soil water content is difficult when analyzing the soil infiltration process as only a few measurements of soil moisture are available for most urban regions with the continuous progress in remote sensing technology some high precision satellite soil moisture products have been developed babaeian et al 2019 and successfully applied to construct hydrological models crow et al 2017 yan and moradkhani 2016 while the satellite soil moisture products have never been used for urban flood modeling in data poor regions another important factor to take into consideration in urban flood modeling is the influence of dense buildings on water flow numerous studies have shown that buildings have a significant impact on urban floods chen et al 2012 fewtrell et al 2008 neal et al 2011 there are four major building treatment methods used in urban flood modeling the building block bb method building hole bh method building resistance br method and building parameter bp method in the bb method buildings are modeled by raising the local topography to the roof level brown et al 2007 the bh method considers building footprints as the calculation boundaries for inundation modeling gallegos et al 2009 the bb and bh methods are mainly applicable to unstructured grids with high resolution digital elevation model dem datasets schubert et al 2008 however for coarse structured grids which cannot be adaptively adjusted to fit building boundaries there is a large degree of generalization when bb and bh methods are applied the br method specifies a very high local roughness in cells occupied by buildings to compensate for the effects of buildings on surface flows however in many cases no objective criteria are used to set the high roughness chen et al 2012 shen et al 2018 with the bp method the building coverage ratio bcr and conveyance reduction factor crf are used to describe the effects of buildings on flow and the method is therefore applicable to urban modeling with coarser dem grids schubert and sanders 2012 sanders et al 2008 proposed a simplified scalar formulation based on the vegetation drag literature to represent the resistance of buildings which they applied to a porosity model that can consider the anisotropy of buildings however for application of the bp method attention should be paid to the relationship between grid size and building scale when the width of the building is equal to the grid size the flood will flow around rather than into or through buildings unless their entrances are left open or the water level exceeds the crest height of any entrances chen et al 2012 jiang et al 2022 shen et al 2018 therefore the aim of this paper is to propose a framework that includes the acquisition of data and detailed characterization of runoff generation and confluence for urban flood modeling in data poor regions using information from multiple sources the following three questions are addressed in this paper 1 how to reasonably generalize the drainage capacity without the pipe system data 2 how to describe the characteristics of runoff generation and confluence accurately in urbanized regions when the high resolution land use cover datasets are not available 3 how to consider the effect of dense buildings on the water flow when there is a lack of high resolution dem dataset to resolve the problem of the paucity of drainage system data the drainage capacity of the pipe system was represented using a cir which was calibrated by coupling satellite soil moisture product and measured flood data to better reflect real drainage conditions moreover an attempt was made to set different cir based on the impervious rates of various land use types to reflect the differences among drainage capacities this framework divides land use cover into several dominant urban land use types which are assigned unique runoff generation and flow confluence parameters in urbanized regions in addition a building treatment method for structured grids was proposed to reflect the impact of buildings on water flow which can consider the anisotropy of buildings and scale of the grid finally the proposed framework was applied to reproduce real flood events in an urban region of 1 2 km2 to determine the effectiveness for urban flood forecasting in data poor urbanized regions 2 study area and data sets 2 1 study area this study was performed in an urban catchment with an area of 1 2 km2 located in the northern part of haizhu district guangzhou china within the campus of sun yat sen university fig 1 due to the nature of the surrounding borders the entire study area is relatively independent of outside influences therefore it was assumed that there was no surface water exchange between the study area and surrounding areas except for the outgoing discharge from the drainage pipe system 2 2 distributed data elevation data were measured at nearly 5 800 points and used to generate the dem of the study area with a spatial resolution of 10 m fig 2 a two types of land use cover data were used in this study the first were derived based on urban land use cover classifications used in previous research liu et al 2017 where the study area was subdivided into eight major land use types commercial service office space unutilized land green space water low density residential high density residential and road according to visual interpretation of high resolution remote sensing images and satellite maps such as google satellite map https www gditu net hereinafter referred to as the udt dataset fig 1c the second type of data were from the highest resolution land use cover dataset publicly available which was published by the gong peng team of tsinghua university spatial resolution of 10 m gong et al 2019 from glc10 dataset https data ess tsinghua edu cn fig 2b the soil type data were derived from the hwsd global database nachtergaele et al 2010 website https www fao org soils portal soil survey soil maps and databases harmonized world soil database v12 en as the study region was classified as urban in this database and there were no effective soil parameters for calculation the thickness of soil layer and the content of sand silt and clay the soil type cn11483 loam closest to the study region for which effective soil parameters were available was selected fig 2c the values of soil related parameters are shown in table 1 among them the saturated hydraulic conductivity was calculated based on the content of sand silt and clay using the soil hydraulic characteristics calculator proposed by arya et al 1981 the infiltration damping coefficient was calculated using a formula described previously based on the saturated hydraulic conductivity wang et al 2019 the soil porosity was assigned a value based on the topsoil usda texture classification in the literature wang et al 2019 the building boundary data were derived from bigmap https www bigemap com and the geometric position information of the building features was corrected manually based on google remote sensing images fig 1c 2 3 hydrological data in this study three flood events that occurred on 24 june 2019 22 july 2019 and 29 july 2019 were used to calibrate and validate the model the water level data were radio electronic water level meter observation data the main characteristics of these three flood events are shown in table 2 the rainfall data were obtained from an automatic precipitation station in the study area with a time resolution of 5 min given the relatively small study area of 1 2 km2 and considering that precipitation is often assumed to be spatially uniform in small catchments david et al 1995 einfalt et al 2004 we used the rainfall at a single point to represent the entire study area berne et al 2004 cao et al 2020 the initial soil water content data were from the soil moisture active passive smap mission level 4 surface and root zone soil moisture l4 sm product https nsidc org data smap smap data html which is the most accurate global scale soil moisture product babaeian et al 2019 the detailed values for the most recent product that ahead of the flood event are shown in table 3 among them the top layer soil wetness 0 5 cm was used to represent the initial soil moisture content of the entire soil layer hossain anni et al 2020 2 4 methodology an overview of the proposed framework for urban flood modeling in data poor regions is presented in fig 3 the framework includes several steps which are briefly explained below 2 5 urban flood prediction model in the urban flood prediction model proposed by wang et al 2019 the momentum equation of saint venant was used to estimate outflow velocity under heavy precipitation due to the small grid size and short time steps it is reasonable to assume that the surface water flow within the grid cell and to its neighboring grid cells is steady and uniform bates and de roo 2000 chen et al 2011 rujner et al 2018 wang and chen 2019 specifically steady indicates no temporal variation in water velocity i e u t 0 while uniform denotes no spatial variation in water velocity i e u x 0 subsequently the flow direction is determined according to the instantaneous height sum of water depth and grid elevation of the grid so the model can capture the reverse flow phenomenon in flat urban areas due to uneven rainfall during large storms or blockage by local obstructions the calculation formula is as follows g s h x c d u 2 h where g is the acceleration due to gravity at a rate of 9 8 m s2 s sin Œ∏ represents the bottom slope Œ∏ unit is the bottom slope angle for a slice of river channel defined by dx h represents the water depth unit m h x represents the water depth at the deepest point for a slice of the river channel defined by dx unit m which varies with location u is the water velocity unit m s and c d is the drag coefficient in the river channel the infiltration curve method is applied to runoff generation as the surface of an urbanized region will have undergone a great deal of modification the runoff generation rate is raised as impervious surface increased guan et al 2015 oudin et al 2018 hence the model uses an impermeability parameter to reflect rapid runoff generation in urbanized regions r t r t 1 p t r t 1 r t 1 where r t unit m represents the remaining surface water depth of the grid cell at time t without consideration of infiltration and drainage of pipe system r t 1 unit m represents the water depth of the grid cell at time t 1 p t unit m represents the precipitation of the grid cell at time t r t 1 unit m and r t 1 unit m represent the water depth of inflow and outflow of the grid cell from t 1 to t respectively considering that infiltration is a relatively slow process compared to the rapid surface runoff caused by intense rainfall during a flooding event thus the model assumed that the infiltrated water from t 1 to t only comes from the remaining surface water at time t in other words infiltration only takes place instantaneously at time t r t r t r t 1 i m p e Œ≤ m d r a where r t unit m represents the final surface water depth of the grid cell at time t i m p dimensionless represents the impervious rate coefficient of the grid cell Œ≤ dimensionless is a damping coefficient describing the decreasing rate of infiltration due to the increase in soil moisture m represents the soil moisture content and d r a unit m represents the drainage capacity of the grid cell from t 1 to t notably we improved this model rather than applying it directly the original model represented the drainage capacity of the pipe system according to the cir and assumed that different land use types have the same drainage capacity which is different from the actual drainage process in this study the cir was assigned different values to represent the differences in drainage capacity of different types of urban land use cover moreover the influence of buildings on water flow was not considered in the urban flood prediction model in this study a building treatment method that considers the anisotropy of buildings and grid scale was embedded in the model to reflect the effects of dense buildings on water flow in urban regions in order to ensure model convergence it is necessary to make sure that a particle of water entering a grid cell would not travel through it until a computation step within the model has been completed wang et al 2019 a calculation time step of 0 5 s used in this study was verified a detailed description of the methods and parameter settings is presented in sections 3 2 3 4 2 6 model parameter settings and drainage capacity representation the parameters of the two types of land use cover data are shown in tables 4 and 5 the impervious rate parameter was determined with reference to previous research cao et al 2020 choi et al 2019 son and kwon 2022 wang et al 2019 parameter c d was assigned a value based on the corresponding impervious rate in the literature wang et al 2019 to set the cir we used the smap l4 product to determine the initial soil water content and used the flood event on july 22 2019 to determine the most appropriate value according to the average nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient of the simulation results as the drainage capacities vary among land uses cover types in urban regions we made a simple assumption that the cir changes linearly with the impervious rate the land use type with higher impervious rate has more manholes of drainage pipe resulting in greater drainage capacity 2 7 building treatment method sanders et al 2008 proposed a simplified scalar formulation to represent the impact of buildings on water flow and showed that the building resistance in a grid can be directly superimposed on the drag coefficient c d in the river channel as the resistance coefficient of the total grid the formulation of building resistance is as follows c d b 1 2 c d 0 a h where c d b represents the building resistance c d 0 is a dimensionless drag coefficient 2 in this study as given by sanders et al 2008 a represents the width of the obstacle perpendicular to the direction of the water flow per unit plane area and h represents the water depth of the grid as the resistance formula was proposed for a porosity model with a larger grid size the scale relationship between the buildings and grids should be considered when applying this formula to the urban flood prediction model previous studies have suggested that when the projected width of a building is equal to the grid size the water flows around rather than into or through the building without considering the water storage effects chen et al 2012 shen et al 2018 hence three cases were considered to restrict the flow confluence patterns in this study fig 4 case 1 parallel outflow directions b d f and h when the projected width of any building in the grid is equal to the c e l l s i z e the grid is impermeable in this direction and the water flows in the direction of the lowest instantaneous height excluding this direction fig 4a case 2 diagonal outflow directions c e g and i when the projected width of any building in the grid is equal to 2 c e l l s i z e the grid is impermeable in this direction and the water flows in the direction of the lowest instantaneous height excluding this direction fig 4b case 3 diagonal outflow directions c e g and i as the calculation of diagonal outflow also depends on the instantaneous heights on both sides of the grid wang et al 2019 for diagonal outflow directions we added an additional scenario to the restriction of the projected width of buildings on the water flow fig 4c in which the instantaneous height of adjacent grids such as grids b and d of the building diagonal flow is higher than the current grid such as grid a and there are buildings at this bearing angle such as the buildings in grid a or c in general the influence of buildings on water flow was divided into two types in this study and the formula of flow confluence is as follows g s h x c d c d b u 2 h w a t e r f l o w s i n a n o t h e r d i r e c t i o n w i t h t h e l o w e s t i n s t a n t a n e o u s h e i g h t i f p a r a l l e l f l o w w p i c e l l s i z e o r d i a g o n a l f l o w w p i 2 c e l l s i z e i f p a r a l l e l f l o w w p i c e l l s i z e o r d i a g o n a l f l o w w p i 2 c e l l s i z e o r t h e s p e c i a l s c e n a r i o o f d i a g o n a l f l o w where w p i unit m represents the projected width of any building in the grid in a certain flow direction and c e l l s i z e unit m represents the width of the grid 2 8 treatment of water flow on building roofs another common challenge when modeling urban flooding is the impact of the roofs of buildings on rainfall runoff processes due to a lack of information on the roof drainage system bruwier et al 2020 adopted a simple conceptual approach to water flow on building roofs in an idealized study assuming that at every time step all rainfall on the roof of a given building is drained instantaneously and transferred to surface flow in cells corresponding to the vertices of the building s footprint however actual buildings have various shapes and it is difficult to capture their vertices therefore in this study we divided the existing building grids into two categories fig 5 in the first category the proportion of building area relative to the grid area is 100 grid a and the rainfall on the roof will be instantly transferred to the grid for surface flow computation in the second category the building area accounts for 100 of the grid area grid b as water flow on the roof should be drained as soon as possible we assumed that the total amount of rainfall on the building roof at every time step will be instantaneously and evenly transferred to the nearest surface grid that has a building area to grid area ratio of 100 in addition it should be noted that the water flow from adjacent grids cannot pass through the grid b 2 9 evaluation of modeling accuracy to quantitatively analyze models constructed under different scenarios the n s e coefficient and maximum inundation depth relative error r e p were used to quantify the difference in flood process between the actual and simulated values the error indicators were formulated as follows n s e 1 t 1 n q t o b s q t s i m 2 t 1 n q t o b s q o b s 2 where q t o b s is the observed value at time t q t s i m is the simulated value at time t n is the number of observed values and q o b s is the average value of the observation series r e p q p o b s q p s i m q p o b s 100 where q p o b s represents an observed value of maximum inundation depth and q p s i m represents a simulated value of flood peak maximum inundation depth 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of different drainage capacity representations three scenarios were tested to explore the effects of different drainage system representations on model accuracy 1 drainage capacity scenario 1 the soil infiltration and drainage capacity of the pipe system were combined and expressed using a total cir the initial soil water content was set for 100 in other words the cir includes the infiltration and drainage capacity of the pipe system 2 drainage capacity scenario 2 soil infiltration was calculated separately and the cir only represented the drainage capacity of the pipe system the value of which was the same for different land use cover types the initial soil water content was set by the corresponding satellite soil moisture product and the infiltration curve method was applied to calculate soil infiltration processes 3 drainage capacity scenario 3 cir only represents the drainage capacity of the pipe system and the cir values were set differently for different land use cover types fig 6 shows the calibration results of the cir under different scenarios the results showed that model accuracy was best with a cir of 80 10 and 20 mm h in drainage capacity scenarios 1 3 respectively drainage capacity scenarios 1 3 were used to construct urban flooding models with suitable values of cir two remaining flood events were simulated and verified and two indicators i e n s e and r e p were used to evaluate the simulation of the remaining flood events the simulation error statistics of the different drainage scenarios are shown in table 6 according to the comparison of drainage capacity scenarios 1 and 2 the simulation accuracy was similar for building 572 for the e20190624 flood event but the n s e and r e p were improved for the e20190729 flood event at fengsheng hall and huangchuanjing hall although the same cir was set for different land use types after calculating the soil infiltration separately the n s e and r e p of fengsheng hall improved from 0 717 and 34 550 to 0 747 and 5 834 respectively while the n s e and r e p of huangchuanjing hall improved from 0 812 and 72 858 to 0 620 and 10 185 respectively further comparison of the simulation results of drainage capacity scenarios 2 and 3 showed that at each waterlogging point both the n s e and r e p were greatly improved by setting different cir values for different land use types in general drainage capacity scenario 3 outperformed the other two scenarios as it had the highest multiple waterlogging point nse value and lowest r e p fig 7 shows the flood processes for simulations conducted under different scenarios the flood process simulated by drainage capacity scenario 1 was mainly characterized by rapid flood rises and declines while the flooding processes simulated by drainage capacity scenarios 2 and 3 were gentler reflecting the decrease in permeability with increasing soil infiltration the manholes of drainage pipes are usually set on impervious surfaces such as roads aichele and andresen 2013 li et al 2020 and the impervious rates differ among various urban land types cao et al 2020 choi et al 2019 son and kwon 2022 wang et al 2019 this leads to differences in the drainage capacity of urban land types as shown in fig 7 the flood processes simulated by drainage capacity scenarios 2 and 3 were quite different especially for building 572 which lacks calibration flood measurements fig 7a this indicated that more attention should be paid to the differences in drainage capacity among various urban land types when there is a lack of measured information drainage capacity scenario 1 could also refer to a case where the soil water content is saturated and only the drainage capacity of the pipe system is considered according to the simulation results it is infeasible to fully consider surface runoff generation and to treat the infiltration rate as zero in urban flood modeling without considering the initial soil water content the initial soil water content should be set carefully as this is crucial for the simulation of flood processes hossain anni et al 2020 the satellite soil moisture product can be used as a reference value when setting the initial soil moisture content in data poor regions notably as this study used a framework that can be applied in any data poor urban region we adopted the global scale smap l4 soil moisture product however for practical use some datasets with higher spatial and temporal resolution can be applied such as those for china li et al 2022 and the usa karthikeyan and mishra 2021 3 2 effects of different land use cover classification datasets the from glc10 dataset is the highest resolution publicly available land use cover dataset with conventional classification types we used it to reconstruct an urban flood model under drainage capacity scenario 3 as the parameters of runoff generation and flow confluence differ among land use cover datasets the cir was recalibrated using the e20190722 flood event to eliminate the influence of drainage capacity on the results the calibration results of the cir constructed by the from glc10 dataset are shown in fig 8 a cir value of 60 mm h was best for the model constructed with the from glc10 dataset this value was quite different from that obtained when using the urban land use type dataset the simulation errors of the models constructed with different land use cover datasets are shown in table 7 the simulated results were poor when using the from glc10 dataset the indicators n s e and r e p of building 572 fengsheng hall and huangchuanjing hall simulated using the from glc10 dataset were 1 328 0 748 and 0 145 and 54 508 10 702 and 42 050 respectively the n s e and r e p of the flood simulation with the udt dataset were markedly improved fig 9 shows the flood processes for simulations using different land use cover datasets fig 10 shows the differences in spatial impervious rates between the udt and from glc10 datasets the impervious rate of the udt dataset was higher than that of the from glc10 dataset in the higher elevation areas surrounding building 572 while the impervious rate of the udt dataset was lower than that of the from glc10 dataset in the areas surrounding huangchuanjing hall these observations were consistent with the flood processes shown in fig 9 the water depths of building 572 simulated with the udt dataset were greater than those simulated with the from glc10 dataset while the opposite was true for the flood processes at huangchuanjing hall for fengsheng hall as the impervious rate of the udt dataset in the surrounding area was slightly lower than that of the from glc10 dataset the water depths simulated by the udt dataset were slightly lower than those simulated using the from glc10 dataset at the initial stage of flood rise subsequently the simulated water depths based on the udt dataset gradually exceeded those based on the from glc10 dataset as the water volume of building 572 gradually flowed into fengsheng hall the results also demonstrated that the highest resolution land use cover dataset publicly available with common classification types cannot describe the characteristics of runoff generation and confluence accurately in urbanized regions compared with natural watersheds the hydrological characteristics of urban regions show greater spatial heterogeneity due to the diverse underlying surface composition and complex microtopography cao et al 2020 in urban regions some permeable surfaces like permeable paving and slender green belts cannot be captured in detail by conventional land classification systems with a resolution of 10 m li et al 2019 schulman and peters 2007 notably parameter homogenization occurs when setting the same parameter values for the same urban land use types when classifying urban land use types it is necessary to ensure that runoff generation and confluence parameters are roughly the same for each land use type to avoid overestimating the runoff generation for permeable surfaces and underestimating it for impervious surfaces more refined land use cover data are required to obtain better model simulation results hu et al 2021 kokkonen et al 2019 li and bortolot 2022 in general in data poor regions high resolution remote sensing images and satellite maps can be used to obtain accurate land use type data through visual interpretation which more accurately captures runoff generation and confluence parameters in urbanized regions 3 3 effects of different building treatment methods three scenarios were constructed to explore the impacts of building treatment methods on simulation results 1 building treatment scenario 1 without considering the influence of buildings on water flow 2 building treatment scenario 2 introducing the resistance formula proposed by sanders et al 2008 in addition we also considered the redistribution of water flow on the building roofs to ensure that the rainfall entering the grid is consistent with building treatment scenario 3 in other words this scenario is like a combination of the bb and bp methods the water flow from adjacent grids cannot pass through the grid b the building area accounts for 100 of the grid area while the influence on water velocity was only considered when the water flow from adjacent grids passes through grid a the proportion of building area relative to the grid area is 100 3 building treatment scenario 3 introducing the resistance formula with restriction of water flow and considering the redistribution of water flow on the building roofs the restricting effect of building projected width on water flow was further considered for the grid a concomitantly to eliminate the influence of drainage capacity on the model results the cir was recalibrated based on the e20190722 flood event fig 11 shows the calibration results of the cir under building treatment scenario 2 which indicated that model accuracy was best with a cir value of 20 mm h as it is necessary to consider buildings in urban flood modeling we also selected 20 mm h as the cir for building treatment scenario 1 to prevent any influence of drainage capacity on the model results table 8 and fig 12 show the error statistics and flood processes for different building treatment methods respectively comparison of the simulation accuracy of building treatment scenarios 1 and 2 showed that the n s e of building 572 fengsheng hall and huangchuanjing hall improved from 0 042 0 738 and 0 689 to 0 374 0 845 and 0 714 respectively with the introduction of the building resistance formula with the exception of huangchuanjing hall the r e p indicator was slightly smaller in building treatment scenario 1 than building treatment scenario 2 r e p could be significantly reduced by introducing the building resistance formula at building 572 and fengsheng hall in the comparison of the results of building treatment scenarios 2 and 3 the n s e of building 572 fengsheng hall and huangchuanjing hall increased by 0 241 0 001 and 0 02 respectively with the addition of water flow restriction to the resistance formula the addition of restriction to the resistance formula had little effect on r e p for fengsheng hall and huangchuanjing hall but adding restriction to the resistance formula significantly reduced r e p for building 572 by 22 713 to further explore the reasons for the differences in simulation results among the building treatment methods the local terrain elevations of the three observation sites were extracted as shown in fig 13 the local depression of building 572 is formed by the local topography and building boundaries fig 13a this study used dem data which contain only basic terrain information without consideration of the elevation of building failure to account for the existence of building 572 results in water flow directly downstream of building 572 which prevents an increase in the water depth fig 12a in addition although the impermeability was considered for the grid b and the outflow velocity was retarded by the introduction of the building resistance formula grid a the water flow would also directly downstream of building 572 as the water depth rose fig 13b it is also necessary to pay consider impermeability according to the characteristics of the buildings and grid scale for the girds which have a building area to grid area ratio of 100 as local depressions are low lying parts of the surrounding terrain at fengsheng hall and huangchuanjing hall fig 13c d the water level would rise without considering the buildings but adding the resistance formula with water flow restriction improved the results 4 conclusions this paper proposed a framework for urban flood modeling in regions with imperfect drainage pipe systems land use cover and dem datasets the urban flood prediction model was modified and applied to an urban region of 1 2 km2 the main findings can be summarized as follows 1 for urban flood modeling without pipe system data it is possible to estimate drainage capacity using the cir however the soil infiltration and pipe system cannot be combined and represented by cir it is not possible to fully consider surface runoff generation and the infiltration rate should not be treated as zero without considering the initial soil water content in addition it should be noted that in the absence of measured information more attention should be paid to the differences in drainage capacity among various urban land types the simulation accuracy can be improved by setting different cir values for various land cover types the initial water content should be set carefully for accurate simulation of flood processes the satellite soil moisture product can be used as a reference when setting the initial soil moisture content for data poor regions 2 the model simulations with the urban land use types can better reflect the temporal variations of flood depths as displayed in the observations moreover the highest resolution land use cover dataset publicly available with common classification types cannot describe the characteristics of runoff generation and confluence accurately in urbanized regions when high resolution land use cover datasets 10 m are not available high resolution remote sensing images and satellite maps can be used to obtain high precision urban land use data through visual interpretation 3 it is necessary to consider the impacts of buildings in urban flood modeling where the simulation results are closely related to topographic data model simulation accuracy can be improved to some extent by introducing the water flow resistance formula but this approach cannot identify impermeability according to the characteristics of buildings and grid scale for the girds that have a building area to grid area ratio of 100 in this study the simulation accuracy was further improved by restricting the pattern of water flow confluence this paper improves the understanding of urban flood processes and helps the decision making in flood risk management for data poor regions nonetheless this study only considered the differences in drainage capacity of different urban land use types corresponding to the impervious rate without considering other factors e g the degree of maintenance of pipe system further study should consider various factors to carry out a more detailed differential allocation of drainage capacity for different land use types furthermore the study area is a small urbanized region of 1 2 km2 which can be easily visually interpreted using remote sensing images and satellite maps however the workload of visual interpretation is increasing as the expanding of the study region more automated methods should be proposed in further study credit authorship contribution statement shichao xu writing original draft conceptualization methodology software yangbo chen resources supervision writing

2536,sediment is of great importance for the lancang mekong river lmr ecosystem providing essential ecological services for local communities understanding sediment change and its driving factors are critical to the sustainable management of this large transboundary river system insufficient background knowledge of sediment dynamics driven by climate change and land cover change hinders our understanding of sediment change in the long term in this study a distributed hydrological model coupled with a sediment module was developed to address the sediment dynamics and its driving factors of the lmr basin from 1968 to 2002 i e the pre dam period a new index was also proposed to quantify the regional sediment composition by considering riverbed deposition the major results are 1 the leading factor influencing the suspended sediment concentration has changed over the study period i e from rainfall before the 1980s to land cover change after the 1980s 2 from 1968 to 2002 the land cover change had the greatest impact on the suspended sediment load followed by rainfall 3 the contribution ratio of the upstream area could be overestimated without considering sediment deposition onto riverbed the approach presented here provides additional insights into quantifying the regional sediment composition for the dynamic lancang mekong river basin experiencing rapid anthropogenic stresses keywords lancang mekong river sediment climate change land cover data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction crossing various geographic zones has been associated with surging economic growth in the lmr basin mainly attributed to the expansion of agriculture industry and infrastructure sectors do et al 2020 morovati et al 2021 such developments have provoked cross border challenges by land use and land cover shifts influencing water yields soil erosion and sediment transport for example in cambodia the annual transported sediment into the tonle sap lake from lmr which brings vital nutrients for feeding the lake s food web has been at times poorly supplied a factor blamed on the construction of mega dams upstream of the lmr and land cover changes kummu et al 2005 such variations in sediment transportation have further resulted in the mekong delta erosion in vietnam where the local people s livelihood heavily depends on rice farming and fishery syvitski et al 2005a b unverricht et al 2013 marchesiello et al 2019 these transboundary sediment related impacts have reopened and drawn international debates and attention over lmr leading to extensive hydrological modeling to assess the anthropogenic effects on sediment since 1990 kondolf et al 2014a b however such assessments particularly for the pre dam period i e before the operation of the mega dams in 2002 are less conducted and have remained at an early stage addressing the pre dam period is essential since insufficient background knowledge of sediment dynamics driven by climate change land cover and land use shifts hinders our understanding of sediment change in the long term limited research of the pre dam period is mainly because accurately simulating the sediment process requires reliable and extensive data wild and loucks 2015 which is unavailable in the lmr basin little relevant data exists and often what is available is of poor quality or offers limited detail regarding grain size distribution walling 2008 wild and loucks 2014 2015 which has led to various viewpoints about sediment role in lmr for example a different view exists regarding the role of the lancang river a part of the lmr in china in suspended sediment load ssl and suspended sediment concentration ssc while some researchers found that the lancang river serves as an essential resource in providing the ssl for the lower mekong river clift et al 2004 mrc 2018 grumbine et al 2012 kondolf et al 2014a b others found that the sediment in the lower mekong river was not significantly supplied with the lancang river chen and he 2000 piman and shrestha 2017 besides it has been reported that lmr delivers virtually 160 mt sediment i e sand and pebbles as bedload into the south china sea where 50 is attributed to the lancang river walling 2005 however this estimation is questionable as the sediment flux at khong chiam with the unknown interval for sediment flux measurement has been significantly overestimated wang et al 2011 and the sand fraction has been underestimated this further implies that accurate transport is more extensive and sand has been under sampled gupta and liew 2007 walling 2008 bravard et al 2013 also a relatively stable condition was reported by walling 2005 for sediment loads of the mekong river for the past 40 years despite data discontinuity and the sporadic ssc dataset contradicting the results reported by fu et al 2008 where different ssc values were obtained along the mekong river in the post dam period i e after the mega dam operation in 2002 a lot of efforts have concentrated on the trapping efficiency approach to investigate the hydropower development impacts on sediment load fu et al 2008 liu and he 2012 they found that the trapping efficiency is virtually within the 80 90 range immediately after the lancang cascade considering 136 dams in the lmr including under construction and commissioned dams revealed a significant decrease in the sediment load in the mekong delta kummu et al 2010 icem 2010 kondolf et al 2014a b however the results of trapping efficiency were not identical a comparison was also conducted by binh et al 2018 and concluded while the lmr experienced an increase in mean discharges from 2012 to 2015 compared to the pre dam period the water level has reduced a factor blamed on the inadequate supply of sediment from the mekong upstream a comparison between the pre and post dam periods regarding discharge volume and sediment load by kameyama et al 2013 revealed an increase in sediment transport for the post dam period other valuable works addressing the sediment behavior in the lmr include delgado et al 2009 walling 2008 kummu and varis 2007 additionally for the middle and upper regions of the lmr river sediment deposition is often excluded and the ssl value of the river cross section is considered to be equal to the sediment yield of the area draining into that section alsoufi et al 2006 suif et al 2013 suif et al 2018 theoretically the sediment particles movement and deposition are influenced by particle size shape and location the lmr s upper portions are characterized by turbulence due to mountainous areas while the lower mekong is more placid providing a suitable place for sediment deposition gupta and liew 2007 wang et al 2011 bravard et al 2014 this could be another reason for the contradictory results discussed earlier requiring further research to address how sediment deposition influences sediment characteristics along lmr climate change can also influence the flow regime of the lmr and sediment flux especially during the wet season with heavy rainfalls nijssen et al 2001 syvitski et al 2005a b zhu et al 2008 shrestha et al 2013 investigated climate change impacts on sediment flux and flow regimes by considering temperature and precipitation data they found that sediment flux in the wet season increased however there were considerable uncertainties for projected hydrological variables regarding precipitation discharge and sediment despite these valuable works no systematic analysis exists to address spatio temporal patterns in a consistent framework for this area and has remained challenging in hydrology due to the lack of data and anthropogenic disturbances associated with land cover control structures in rivers and climate change at present the spatio temporal patterns of the ssl in the lmr and the corresponding driving factors to the land cover and rainfall have not been well addressed questions regarding which hydrological variable plays a leading role in the ssl in various periods and prioritizing the order of importance of variables have remained unanswered insufficient understanding of such questions for the pre dam period hinders sustainable long term management of this transboundary river system especially under the current infrastructure development in this study a distributed hydrological model coupled with a sediment module was developed to simulate the sediment transport process in the lmr basin combined with the measured runoff and sediment data the regional characteristics and the attribution ratio of ssl in the basin were analyzed followed by the role of sediment deposition in the sediment analysis of the lmr 2 data and method 2 1 study area the lmr originates from the northern foot of tanggula mountain on the tibetan plateau of china spanning various physiographic regions of myanmar laos thailand cambodia and vietnam the lmr with virtually 5000 km length liu et al 2009a b and mean annual water discharge of around 470 km3 mrc 2009 drains an area of 795000 km2 from its source i e the tibetan plateau to the south china sea in ho chi minh city vietnam manh et al 2015 while the lancang river runs through deep valleys in hengduan mountains categorized as the north south mountains the downstream course i e the mekong river flows through relatively flat terrains with broad ravines the main physiographic regions of the mekong river include northern highlands khorat plateau tonle sap lake basin and mekong delta lyon et al 2017 the northern highlands covers laos thailand and some parts of vietnam where the lmr flows through steep rock cut valleys with a low gradient region providing dendritic flow features for lmr khorat plateau covers northeast thailand and the eastern margin of central laos the tonle sap lake basin covers most of cambodia and the southern portion of laos the transported sediment flux from lmr to the lake and its surrounding area due to the reverse flow phenomenon flow from lmr to the lake during flooding season is on average 7 mt yr 1 kummu et al 2005 wup fin 2003 which brings vital nutrients fertilizing the floodplain for fish spawning and rice farming manh et al 2013 during the non reverse flow period flow from the lake to the lmr has very low ssc manh et al 2015 mekong delta influenced by the transported fine grained sediment from upstream regions hung et al 2014 covers a large portion of vietnam the primary rice growing area for local communities grumbine et al 2012 manh et al 2014 the lmr basin is therefore geologically diverse and complicated regarding sediment characteristics the lancang river is characterized by a mountainous area with a predominantly coarse grid tending to deposit rather than suspension whereas the lower mekong is placid with a deposition prone riverbed in northern laos sand and gravel exist in the mainstream of the lmr bravard et al 2013 fig 1 shows the lmr basin and the hydrological stations location for analysis in this study 2 2 data assembly we take the basin above phnom penh as the study object its area is about 663 000 km2 accounting for 81 9 of the total basin area and 545 km from the estuary based on the digital elevation model dem with a spatial resolution of 1 1 km2 the study area was divided into sub basins by the pfafstetter method pfafstetter 1989 and the sub basins with an area of more than 5000 km2 were further subdivided to make the area of each sub basin less than 5000 km2 the study area was finally divided into 651 sub basins for the purposes of this study six hydrological stations were considered to investigate the sediment transport process in the lmr where gajiu jiuzhou and jinghong stations are located in the lancang river while chiang sean chiang khan and mukdahan stations are in the mekong river see fig 1 all hydrological stations provided measured daily discharge data lancang river hydrological stations provided the daily ssc observation records during flood season i e may to november the mekong river hydrological station s ssc sampling frequency was 27 50 times in total on average 4 7 times per month while during the dry season this was once only per month for lancang river hydrological stations the sampling frequency was once per day throughout the year the daily meteorological data were obtained from the rainfall and meteorological stations provided by the mekong river commission mrc for the mekong river basin we collected daily data from 166 rain and 32 meteorological gauge stations from 1968 to 2002 with high quality temporal continuity from mrc for the lancang sub regions we collected data from 12 meteorological gauge stations with continuous records during the same period meteorological data contain near surface air pressure air temperature air specific humidity wind speed and direction sunshine duration and solar radiation they were used to calculate potential evapotranspiration based on the penman monteith equation an essential input variable for the tsinghua representative elementary watershed threw model with a spatial resolution of 10 10 km the global soil data supplied by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao were used for soil data the published products of modis moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer regarding normalized difference vegetation index ndvi leaf area index lai and snow cover index with a spatial resolution of 500 500 m and temporal resolution of 16 days were utilized land cover time series data provided by earth science center tsinghua university was used from 1982 to 2002 liu et al 2020 2 3 water and sediment modeling in this study threw model the tsinghua hydrological model based on representative elemental watershed was used to simulate the natural runoff in the lmr tian et al 2008 the employed model has already been proven to yield highly accurate discharge time series data tian et al 2020 morovati et al 2022 sediment erosion re entrainment deposition and bed degradation in the main channel were incorporated into the developed hydrological model for sediment processes which have been applied to the upper sangamon river basin with sound results hillslope produces sediment and surface runoff transports the generated sediment into the main channel the sediment is either allowed to deposit or removed by the streamflow in this process the degradation happens when all loose sediment is removed from the channel bed eqs 1 and 2 are used for the sediment erosion rate q s kg s and total degradation deg kg s respectively for more details on the method adopted in the sediment module and the performance please refer to liu et al 2009a b 1 q s c s q Œ¥ 2 deg k 1 k 2 Œ≥ q r s r if s s 0 i f s s 0 where c and Œ¥ are the empirical parameters s is the slope of the region and q is the water discharge m3 s k 1 and k 2 are parameters q r is the streamflow in the main channel m3 s s r is the slope of the main channel and s s is sediment storage adopting the nested calibration approach four hydrological stations i e jinghong chiang sean chiang khan and mukdahan were used to calibrate the developed model based on the discharge time series data from 1968 to 1977 followed by the period of 1978 2002 for validation the employed calibration approach follows calibration from upstream to downstream it fixes the calibrated upstream sub basins parameters and uses the downstream hydrological observation data to calibrate the downstream sub basins parameters an automatic algorithm pysot developed by eriksson et al 2019 was used to optimize the parameter values based on an objective function of nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 eq 3 3 nse 1 n 1 n q obs n q sim n 2 n 1 n q obs t q obs 2 where n is the total number of days in the evaluation period q obs n and q sim n represent the observed and simulated runoff on the n th day respectively q obs represents the average of observed runoff in the evaluation period 2 4 quantifying regional sediment composition with riverbed deposition the regional sediment composition refers to the percentage of ssl in a downstream section that comes from a certain upstream section to quantify the regional composition of sediment along a river a simple sectional ssl ratio method is often adopted which calculates the ratio of ssl at an upstream river section a over that at a downstream section b this ratio is assumed to represent the contribution ratio of the area draining to a at section b however this method may overestimate the upper regions sediment yield ratio and underestimate the lower regions ratio if significant sediment deposition occurs along the river course as discussed earlier the lmr experiences significant deposition in some river sections therefore the sectional ssl ratio method cannot reasonably reflect the sediment characteristics of the basin to better describe the regional sediment composition in the lmr basin with much deposition we propose a new index the ssl proportion rj i that is the ssl proportion of the s j section from the upstream region i the upstream basin of the section s i different from the sectional ssl ratio the ssl proportion takes account of sediment deposition along the river to illustrate the concept two consecutive cross sections i e s1 and s2 are defined in fig 2 representing the entrance and exit of a sub basin unit in fig 2 the sediment load of the s 1 and s 2 cross sections are l 1 and l 2 respectively the total sediment deposition from l 1 to l 2 is d 12 note that r i i 1 since we divide the number of regions and each region has a relatively small area and a relatively short river length each region can be considered as a micro element therefore we assume that the proportion of sediment transport from different regions is equal to the proportion of deposition in each region i e the proportion from l i in d 12 is equal to the proportion from l i in l 2 then we can reasonably assume the deposition amount of sediment originating from the region i be r 2 i d 12 in this way the ssl proportion r 2 i can be calculated as follows 4 r 2 i r 1 i l 1 r 2 i d 12 l 2 by reorganizing eq 4 we have 5 r 2 i r 1 i l 1 l 2 d 12 repeat the above procedure we can calculate the ssl proportion r j i for all the cross sections based on the threw model s distributed water and sediment simulations 2 5 analysis method for sediment dynamics and attribution before 2002 only the manwan dam was constructed in the lancang river while after 2003 the number of mega dams increased and jinghong xiaowan and nuozhadu dams were put into operation to investigate the sediment dynamics before 2002 first we used the mann kendal test m k test to identify the abrupt changes in ssc and the main influence regions of sediment processes in jinghong and mukdahan the m k test is composed of uf and ub curves and a 0 05 significance level line the uf and ub curves represent the changing trend of statistical data and calculate the abrupt change point respectively considering the critical value u0 05 of 1 96 a significant upward or downward trend occurs when the uf exceeds the critical value however the trend may or may not be linear if the intersection of the uf and ub curves is between the critical lines an abrupt change point occurs then we try to explore the dominant drivers of ssc dynamics such as climate change and human activities precipitation data can reflect the influence of natural factors on ssc and ndvi can reflect the influence of human activities on ssc the abrupt change of the ssc s dominant factors is determined by analyzing the long time data of ssc annual precipitation and annual ndvi since ndvi cannot completely reflect the influence of human activities for example if the land use changes from cropland to grassland or woodland ndvi may have little change but ssc may be significantly different therefore we also used lulc data to analyze the impact of human activities on ssc and explored the possible additional abrupt change limited by the observed ssc data the calibration method used for sediment parameters is as follows from 1968 to 1971 the measured ssc of jinghong chiang sean chiang khan and mukdahan stations were successively used to calibrate the sediment module parameters by the nested approach the measured sediment data of jinghong and mukdahan stations were then used to calibrate the sediment parameters of the other times the calibration procedure is shown in table 1 1 calibrate the parameters of higher forest coverage and lower sediment yield in the late 1960 s 2 calibrate the parameters of the highest sediment yield of the lancang river from 1992 to 1994 3 calibrate the parameters in the early 2000s during which the soil and water conservation decreasing the sediment yield in the lancang river while the forest coverage area of the mekong river basin continued to decrease and the sediment yield increased the specific reasons for adopting the given calibration approach can be found in section 3 4 according to the time of abrupt change of ssc dominant factors we extended the parameters of the calibration periods to 1968 2002 to simulate the natural sediment process under the actual lulc variation for the area above jinghong station the parameters for all years in the climate factor dominated period are a1 the parameters of the lulc factor dominated period before soil and water conservation are uniformly transitioned from a1 to a2 and the parameters of the lulc factor dominated period after soil and water conservation are uniformly transitioned from a2 to a3 similarly for the area between jinghong and mukdahan stations the parameters are b1 for all years in the climate factor dominated phase and b2 for all years in the lulc factor dominated phase the extended parameters are used for model simulation and attribution analysis in the attribution analysis section we use the control variables method through comparing different scenarios dominated by different drivers i e climate change lulc change and human activities we analyze the response of the sediment processes to each driver in the lmr 3 results 3 1 hydrological model calibration and validation table 2 gives information on the developed model s performance based on the nse values of four hydrological stations for daily runoff two periods were selected 1968 to 1977 for calibration and 1978 to 2002 for validation while limited by the sediment observation data we only calculate the nse values of monthly ssl at jinghong and mukdahan stations the calibration periods for jinghong station are 1968 1972 1992 1994 and 2000 2002 and the validation periods are 1973 1991 and 1995 1999 the calibration periods for the mukdahan station are 1968 1972 and 2000 2002 and the validation period for the mukdahan station is 1973 1999 the yielded nses show the relatively high efficiency of the developed model in sediment and runoff simulation fig 3 a and b show the simulation results of the monthly ssl between 1968 and 2002 and the normalized simulated and measured monthly ssl values for mukdahan and jinghong stations respectively the yielded results shown in fig 3 highlight that the model has well predicted most of the measured values the closer the values to the line the greater the model s accuracy in the scatter plot fig 3b comparing the predicted and observed monthly ssl values shows that the developed model can predict low mid and high monthly ssl values with high accuracy despite some discrepancies in high values see fig 3a note that the ssl values of the jinghong station were not allowed to be present due to data security policy 3 2 regional sediment balance table 3 gives information on the sediment characteristics for upstream of the jinghong station and the areas between jinghong chiang sean chiang sean chiang khan and chiang khan mukdahan stations see fig 1 for the location of the stations the yielded annual ssl from 1968 to 2002 increased from the upper regions to lower regions i e jinghong to mukdahan with a more pronounced increase attributed to after the chiang sean station the results reveal that the area between jinghong chiang sean insignificantly increased the annual ssl compared to the areas located upstream of the mukdahan station the same trend is also observed for sediment deposition however the highest deposition is attributed to the area between chiang khan and mukdahan with 11 million tonnes interestingly the most significant sediment yield is obtained in the upper region of the jinghong station followed by areas between chiang khan mukdahan chiang sean chiang khan and jinghong chiang sean based on such characteristics and limited by the observed sediment data of the mekong river the following analysis of the sediment process is mainly focused on the two cross sections of jinghong and mukdahan stations and the sediment module parameter calibration in the threw model also mainly adopts the sediment data provided by jinghong and mukdahan stations fig 4 illustrates the annual ssl change for mukdahan station over the investigated period i e 1968 to 2002 despite some reductions compared to 1968 the annual ssl experienced a fluctuating upward trend such fluctuations seem to be induced by lulc changes and climate variations e g in annual rainfall as no mega dam was constructed during the period particularly between 1968 and 1995 the most significant reduction is attributed to 1992 after 1995 although the annual ssl experienced some drops the annual ssl remained virtually higher than that of 1968 highlighting the insignificant influence of the operated dams on the annual ssl in the area during this period 3 3 sediment deposition onto the riverbed while sediment deposition research has mainly focused on the lower mekong wang et al 2011 manh et al 2014 research addressing the role of the upper mekong with deposition prone riverbeds and how the upper sub basins influence the sediment deposition is limited as a complex natural channel with an island in the dry season the chiang sean station s cross section is illustrated in fig 5 a due to the measured data scarcity of this cross section in different periods the rating curve water level discharge relationship change can roughly reflect the river s natural deposition fig 5b and c show the double mass curve and scatter plot of observed daily water level vs discharge respectively between 1993 and 2002 in this period the slope of the double mass curve of daily water level vs discharge decreased as shown in fig 5b also as illustrated in fig 5c during the low flow period in the dry season the water level corresponding to the same discharge has increased by around 1 m indicating continuous sediment deposition in the riverbed 3 4 sediment dynamics and driving factors fig 6 a and c illustrate the variation trend of the measured ssc in the jinghong and mukdahan stations from 1968 to 2002 respectively the abrupt time change of ssc in jinghong is 1978 where the uf and ub curves intersect in the 95 significant interval for mukdahan station 1985 is the changing point where its ssc s downward trend changes to an upward trend revealing that the ssc changes in jinghong and mukdahan stations are not synchronous the analyses shown in fig 6a and c reveal that the ssc changes in jinghong and mukdahan stations are mainly influenced by areas above jinghong and the area between jinghong and mukdahan stations respectively therefore in the following analysis we use the trends of ssc at jinghong and mukdahan stations to reflect the sediment dynamics of the area above jinghong station and the area between jinghong and mukdahan stations respectively fig 6b and d show the uf statistics of annual rainfall annual maximum ndvi and ssc for the areas above jinghong station and between jinghong and mukdahan stations the variation trend of the ssc for the area above jinghong station from 1968 to 1984 was virtually similar to that of rainfall indicating that rainfall was the dominant factor in ssc in this period we refer to 1968 1984 as the climate factor dominated period from 1984 to 1993 the ssc increased while the rainfall slightly decreased implying that rainfall was not the dominant factor over this period from 1984 to 2002 the ssc of jinghong first increased and then dropped which is highly consistent with the trend of ndvi it is seen that the dominant factor of ssc of jinghong has changed from rainfall to land cover since 1984 thus we refer to 1984 2002 as the lulc factor dominated period in conclusion ssc s dominant factor in the area above jinghong station changed from rainfall to land cover and the change point was in 1984 similarly from 1968 to 1982 the ssc in mukdahan station and the precipitation in the area between jinghong and mukdahan stations decreased with the same trend indicating that the dominant factor affecting the ssc of mukdahan station during this period was rainfall we call 1968 1982 a climate factor dominated period from 1982 to 2002 the rainfall remained almost constant while the ssc in mukdahan stations showed an upward trend highlighting that rainfall was no longer the dominant factor regarding the ndvi trend from 1982 to 2002 no significant change occurred however according to lulc data provided by the earth science center tsinghua university in fig 7 a a large area of the forest in the mrb was changed into grasslands and farmlands in the late 1980 s exacerbating soil erosion in this area thus the lulc change in the area between jinghong and mukdahan stations appeared to be the dominant factor for ssc after 1982 we refer to 1982 2002 as the lulc factor dominated period with the change point of 1982 the dominant factor changed from rainfall to lulc in the area between mukdahan and jinghong stations over the study period climate change has certain spatial variability which makes the timing of the abrupt change of the ssc s dominant factor not to be exactly consistent in different stations the abrupt change of the ssc s dominant factor in jinghong station occurred in 1984 while in mukdahan station occurred in 1982 therefore it s reasonable to consider 1984 as the timing of the abrupt change of the ssc s dominant factor in the areas above jinghong stations and between jinghong and mukdahan stations fig 7b shows that the peak number of barren lands was reached in 1993 mainly distributed in the upper part of the lancang river barren land has the lowest surface erosion resistance compared to other land use types especially upstream of lancang river where the slope is relatively large gyssels et al 2005 this led to a high level of ssl at jinghong station in 1993 fig 6b therefore the abrupt change for the region above jinghong station occurred in 1993 when the sediment yield of the lancang river was the highest in the early 2000 s the soil and water conservation project in the lancang river basin took effect thus its sediment yield decreased while the mekong river basin forest cover continued to decrease and its sediment yield increased therefore the year 2002 is considered as an abrupt change and also the end of the study period 3 5 attribution analysis of sediment characteristics according to the above analysis abrupt changes occurred in 1984 1993 and 2002 the model uses the values observed in each year in two different series notated a and b the values in each series for 1984 1993 and 2002 are denoted 1 2 and 3 respectively the parameters for the years between each value in each series are determined using an arithmetic sequence method for the region above jinghong station the model parameters for 1968 1983 are a1 for 1984 1993 are from a1 to a2 and for 1994 2002 are from a2 to a3 for the area between jinghong and mukdahan stations the model parameters are b1 for 1968 1983 and for 1984 2002 are from b1 to b2 using the control variables method we simulate the ssl changes resulting from each driver change and thus obtain the contribution of different influencing factors to the ssl changes we set up four scenarios to study the contribution ratio of climate change and lulc factors to the annual mean ssl change for different periods in different regions the scenario design and results are given in table 4 scenario 1 fixes the lulc in the lmr in the late 1960 s to analyze the impacts of rainfall changes on the ssl of jinghong and mukdahan stations from 1968 to 2002 scenario 2 analyzes the impacts of lulc changes on the ssl of jinghong and mukdahan stations and the region between jinghong and mukdahan stations from 1968 to 2002 scenarios 3 and 4 analyze the impacts of lulc changes in the area above jinghong station on the ssl of jinghong and mukdahan stations for 1968 1992 and 1993 2002 respectively from 1968 to 2002 rainfall change decreased jinghong and mukdahan s ssl by 23 and 34 respectively at the same time lulc change in the upstream region of jinghong increased jinghong and mukdahan s ssl by 14 and 8 respectively while a more significant increase was attributed to the area between jinghong and mukdahan where mukdahan s ssl increased by 56 it is seen that from 1968 to 2002 for the mukdahan section the greatest impact on ssl change was land cover in the area between jinghong and mukdahan the second significant impact was attributed to rainfall 4 discussion extensive research has been conducted to address the sedimentation process along lmr mainly using measured data discontinuous and sporadic data satellite images and rating curves zhang et al 2014 unverricht et al 2014 dang et al 2018a b research into exploring spatio temporal patterns of sediment load and driving factors in lmr before the operation of mega dams 1968 2002 is limited and most researchers have focused on the lower mekong basin wang et al 2011 manh et al 2015 demaster et al 2017 dang et al 2018a b shrestha et al 2018 from chiang sean towards mekong delta since related data was unavailable lu and siew 2006 this research provides additional insights into the role of the chinese part on the lower mekong s sediment characteristics and sediment deposition in different areas for example the annual ssl from 1968 to 2002 increased from the upper regions to lower regions i e jinghong to mukdahan with a more pronounced increase attributed to areas after the chiang sean station we also found that the ssl for the area between jinghong and chiang sean remained almost constant the highest sediment deposition was attributed to the area between chiang khan and mukdahan for mukdahan station the present study reported the continuous annual ssl for the years 1968 to 2002 while walling 2008 and lu and siew 2006 presented the yearly ssl only for years with high data quality however the pattern obtained was consistent despite discrepancies in obtained values which can be attributed to the more samples used in this study to develop the sediment module as well as the defined sediment deposition index conducted works reported that the ssc trend experienced a declining trend for the pre dam period for the lower mekong course however this study found a significant upward trend after 1978 for jinghong station s annual ssc contradicting the findings reported by lu and siew 2006 concerning the negative role of manwan dam on the chiang sean station research reported no similar trend for the ssc change from station to station lu and siew 2006 kummu and varis 2007 fu et al 2008 xue et al 2011 which was further supported in the present work however crucial additional insights were provided in this work by attributing the role of land use and land cover changes and precipitation to the yielded ssc at various stations for example the land use and land cover change e g deforestation to develop grasslands and farmlands of the area between jinghong and mukdahan stations appeared to be the dominant driver for ssc after 1982 the dominant factor changed from rainfall to land cover in the mukdahan and jinghong stations over the study period the contribution of rainfall and land cover to the mean annual ssl was also investigated from 1968 to 2002 the most significant impact on ssl change was land cover in the area between jinghong and mukdahan a 56 increase for mukdahan s ssl the second significant impact was attributed to rainfall 5 conclusions to address the spatial composition of sediment sediment dynamics and driving factors influencing the sediment process in the lmr a distributed hydrological model coupled with a sediment module was developed to reconstruct the sediment process of the lmr a new index to quantify the regional composition of the sediment was also developed to present and analyze the results of the sediment characteristics quantitively six hydrological stations including mukdahan jinghong gajiu chiang sean chiang khan and jiuzhou were considered in the developed model the major findings are as follows 1 the results showed that sediment contribution from the upstream sub basins would be overestimated if sediment deposition was ignored for example the results corresponding to the newly developed index i e ssl proportion indicated that the annual average ssl proportion of the upper region of jinghong to mukdahan was 50 4 while the cross sectional ssl ratio of jinghong and mukdahan was 64 9 2 temporal trends of ssc in the gajiu jinghong and mukdahan stations were different no correlation was found between these three stations this means that farther upstream subbasins did not play a significant role and the closer the subbasin to the cross section the greater the impact of ssl 3 although the temporal trends were different the dominant factors were the same before the early 1980 s the dominant factor of jinghong and mukdahan s ssc was rainfall while after the 1980 s it was land cover 4 for the area between jinghong to mukdahan land cover change had the most significant impact on the ssl from 1968 to 2002 followed by rainfall the results also highlighted that land cover change in jinghong s upper region slightly impacted the ssl credit authorship contribution statement fuqiang tian conceptualization investigation resources data curation writing review editing supervision

2536,sediment is of great importance for the lancang mekong river lmr ecosystem providing essential ecological services for local communities understanding sediment change and its driving factors are critical to the sustainable management of this large transboundary river system insufficient background knowledge of sediment dynamics driven by climate change and land cover change hinders our understanding of sediment change in the long term in this study a distributed hydrological model coupled with a sediment module was developed to address the sediment dynamics and its driving factors of the lmr basin from 1968 to 2002 i e the pre dam period a new index was also proposed to quantify the regional sediment composition by considering riverbed deposition the major results are 1 the leading factor influencing the suspended sediment concentration has changed over the study period i e from rainfall before the 1980s to land cover change after the 1980s 2 from 1968 to 2002 the land cover change had the greatest impact on the suspended sediment load followed by rainfall 3 the contribution ratio of the upstream area could be overestimated without considering sediment deposition onto riverbed the approach presented here provides additional insights into quantifying the regional sediment composition for the dynamic lancang mekong river basin experiencing rapid anthropogenic stresses keywords lancang mekong river sediment climate change land cover data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction crossing various geographic zones has been associated with surging economic growth in the lmr basin mainly attributed to the expansion of agriculture industry and infrastructure sectors do et al 2020 morovati et al 2021 such developments have provoked cross border challenges by land use and land cover shifts influencing water yields soil erosion and sediment transport for example in cambodia the annual transported sediment into the tonle sap lake from lmr which brings vital nutrients for feeding the lake s food web has been at times poorly supplied a factor blamed on the construction of mega dams upstream of the lmr and land cover changes kummu et al 2005 such variations in sediment transportation have further resulted in the mekong delta erosion in vietnam where the local people s livelihood heavily depends on rice farming and fishery syvitski et al 2005a b unverricht et al 2013 marchesiello et al 2019 these transboundary sediment related impacts have reopened and drawn international debates and attention over lmr leading to extensive hydrological modeling to assess the anthropogenic effects on sediment since 1990 kondolf et al 2014a b however such assessments particularly for the pre dam period i e before the operation of the mega dams in 2002 are less conducted and have remained at an early stage addressing the pre dam period is essential since insufficient background knowledge of sediment dynamics driven by climate change land cover and land use shifts hinders our understanding of sediment change in the long term limited research of the pre dam period is mainly because accurately simulating the sediment process requires reliable and extensive data wild and loucks 2015 which is unavailable in the lmr basin little relevant data exists and often what is available is of poor quality or offers limited detail regarding grain size distribution walling 2008 wild and loucks 2014 2015 which has led to various viewpoints about sediment role in lmr for example a different view exists regarding the role of the lancang river a part of the lmr in china in suspended sediment load ssl and suspended sediment concentration ssc while some researchers found that the lancang river serves as an essential resource in providing the ssl for the lower mekong river clift et al 2004 mrc 2018 grumbine et al 2012 kondolf et al 2014a b others found that the sediment in the lower mekong river was not significantly supplied with the lancang river chen and he 2000 piman and shrestha 2017 besides it has been reported that lmr delivers virtually 160 mt sediment i e sand and pebbles as bedload into the south china sea where 50 is attributed to the lancang river walling 2005 however this estimation is questionable as the sediment flux at khong chiam with the unknown interval for sediment flux measurement has been significantly overestimated wang et al 2011 and the sand fraction has been underestimated this further implies that accurate transport is more extensive and sand has been under sampled gupta and liew 2007 walling 2008 bravard et al 2013 also a relatively stable condition was reported by walling 2005 for sediment loads of the mekong river for the past 40 years despite data discontinuity and the sporadic ssc dataset contradicting the results reported by fu et al 2008 where different ssc values were obtained along the mekong river in the post dam period i e after the mega dam operation in 2002 a lot of efforts have concentrated on the trapping efficiency approach to investigate the hydropower development impacts on sediment load fu et al 2008 liu and he 2012 they found that the trapping efficiency is virtually within the 80 90 range immediately after the lancang cascade considering 136 dams in the lmr including under construction and commissioned dams revealed a significant decrease in the sediment load in the mekong delta kummu et al 2010 icem 2010 kondolf et al 2014a b however the results of trapping efficiency were not identical a comparison was also conducted by binh et al 2018 and concluded while the lmr experienced an increase in mean discharges from 2012 to 2015 compared to the pre dam period the water level has reduced a factor blamed on the inadequate supply of sediment from the mekong upstream a comparison between the pre and post dam periods regarding discharge volume and sediment load by kameyama et al 2013 revealed an increase in sediment transport for the post dam period other valuable works addressing the sediment behavior in the lmr include delgado et al 2009 walling 2008 kummu and varis 2007 additionally for the middle and upper regions of the lmr river sediment deposition is often excluded and the ssl value of the river cross section is considered to be equal to the sediment yield of the area draining into that section alsoufi et al 2006 suif et al 2013 suif et al 2018 theoretically the sediment particles movement and deposition are influenced by particle size shape and location the lmr s upper portions are characterized by turbulence due to mountainous areas while the lower mekong is more placid providing a suitable place for sediment deposition gupta and liew 2007 wang et al 2011 bravard et al 2014 this could be another reason for the contradictory results discussed earlier requiring further research to address how sediment deposition influences sediment characteristics along lmr climate change can also influence the flow regime of the lmr and sediment flux especially during the wet season with heavy rainfalls nijssen et al 2001 syvitski et al 2005a b zhu et al 2008 shrestha et al 2013 investigated climate change impacts on sediment flux and flow regimes by considering temperature and precipitation data they found that sediment flux in the wet season increased however there were considerable uncertainties for projected hydrological variables regarding precipitation discharge and sediment despite these valuable works no systematic analysis exists to address spatio temporal patterns in a consistent framework for this area and has remained challenging in hydrology due to the lack of data and anthropogenic disturbances associated with land cover control structures in rivers and climate change at present the spatio temporal patterns of the ssl in the lmr and the corresponding driving factors to the land cover and rainfall have not been well addressed questions regarding which hydrological variable plays a leading role in the ssl in various periods and prioritizing the order of importance of variables have remained unanswered insufficient understanding of such questions for the pre dam period hinders sustainable long term management of this transboundary river system especially under the current infrastructure development in this study a distributed hydrological model coupled with a sediment module was developed to simulate the sediment transport process in the lmr basin combined with the measured runoff and sediment data the regional characteristics and the attribution ratio of ssl in the basin were analyzed followed by the role of sediment deposition in the sediment analysis of the lmr 2 data and method 2 1 study area the lmr originates from the northern foot of tanggula mountain on the tibetan plateau of china spanning various physiographic regions of myanmar laos thailand cambodia and vietnam the lmr with virtually 5000 km length liu et al 2009a b and mean annual water discharge of around 470 km3 mrc 2009 drains an area of 795000 km2 from its source i e the tibetan plateau to the south china sea in ho chi minh city vietnam manh et al 2015 while the lancang river runs through deep valleys in hengduan mountains categorized as the north south mountains the downstream course i e the mekong river flows through relatively flat terrains with broad ravines the main physiographic regions of the mekong river include northern highlands khorat plateau tonle sap lake basin and mekong delta lyon et al 2017 the northern highlands covers laos thailand and some parts of vietnam where the lmr flows through steep rock cut valleys with a low gradient region providing dendritic flow features for lmr khorat plateau covers northeast thailand and the eastern margin of central laos the tonle sap lake basin covers most of cambodia and the southern portion of laos the transported sediment flux from lmr to the lake and its surrounding area due to the reverse flow phenomenon flow from lmr to the lake during flooding season is on average 7 mt yr 1 kummu et al 2005 wup fin 2003 which brings vital nutrients fertilizing the floodplain for fish spawning and rice farming manh et al 2013 during the non reverse flow period flow from the lake to the lmr has very low ssc manh et al 2015 mekong delta influenced by the transported fine grained sediment from upstream regions hung et al 2014 covers a large portion of vietnam the primary rice growing area for local communities grumbine et al 2012 manh et al 2014 the lmr basin is therefore geologically diverse and complicated regarding sediment characteristics the lancang river is characterized by a mountainous area with a predominantly coarse grid tending to deposit rather than suspension whereas the lower mekong is placid with a deposition prone riverbed in northern laos sand and gravel exist in the mainstream of the lmr bravard et al 2013 fig 1 shows the lmr basin and the hydrological stations location for analysis in this study 2 2 data assembly we take the basin above phnom penh as the study object its area is about 663 000 km2 accounting for 81 9 of the total basin area and 545 km from the estuary based on the digital elevation model dem with a spatial resolution of 1 1 km2 the study area was divided into sub basins by the pfafstetter method pfafstetter 1989 and the sub basins with an area of more than 5000 km2 were further subdivided to make the area of each sub basin less than 5000 km2 the study area was finally divided into 651 sub basins for the purposes of this study six hydrological stations were considered to investigate the sediment transport process in the lmr where gajiu jiuzhou and jinghong stations are located in the lancang river while chiang sean chiang khan and mukdahan stations are in the mekong river see fig 1 all hydrological stations provided measured daily discharge data lancang river hydrological stations provided the daily ssc observation records during flood season i e may to november the mekong river hydrological station s ssc sampling frequency was 27 50 times in total on average 4 7 times per month while during the dry season this was once only per month for lancang river hydrological stations the sampling frequency was once per day throughout the year the daily meteorological data were obtained from the rainfall and meteorological stations provided by the mekong river commission mrc for the mekong river basin we collected daily data from 166 rain and 32 meteorological gauge stations from 1968 to 2002 with high quality temporal continuity from mrc for the lancang sub regions we collected data from 12 meteorological gauge stations with continuous records during the same period meteorological data contain near surface air pressure air temperature air specific humidity wind speed and direction sunshine duration and solar radiation they were used to calculate potential evapotranspiration based on the penman monteith equation an essential input variable for the tsinghua representative elementary watershed threw model with a spatial resolution of 10 10 km the global soil data supplied by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao were used for soil data the published products of modis moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer regarding normalized difference vegetation index ndvi leaf area index lai and snow cover index with a spatial resolution of 500 500 m and temporal resolution of 16 days were utilized land cover time series data provided by earth science center tsinghua university was used from 1982 to 2002 liu et al 2020 2 3 water and sediment modeling in this study threw model the tsinghua hydrological model based on representative elemental watershed was used to simulate the natural runoff in the lmr tian et al 2008 the employed model has already been proven to yield highly accurate discharge time series data tian et al 2020 morovati et al 2022 sediment erosion re entrainment deposition and bed degradation in the main channel were incorporated into the developed hydrological model for sediment processes which have been applied to the upper sangamon river basin with sound results hillslope produces sediment and surface runoff transports the generated sediment into the main channel the sediment is either allowed to deposit or removed by the streamflow in this process the degradation happens when all loose sediment is removed from the channel bed eqs 1 and 2 are used for the sediment erosion rate q s kg s and total degradation deg kg s respectively for more details on the method adopted in the sediment module and the performance please refer to liu et al 2009a b 1 q s c s q Œ¥ 2 deg k 1 k 2 Œ≥ q r s r if s s 0 i f s s 0 where c and Œ¥ are the empirical parameters s is the slope of the region and q is the water discharge m3 s k 1 and k 2 are parameters q r is the streamflow in the main channel m3 s s r is the slope of the main channel and s s is sediment storage adopting the nested calibration approach four hydrological stations i e jinghong chiang sean chiang khan and mukdahan were used to calibrate the developed model based on the discharge time series data from 1968 to 1977 followed by the period of 1978 2002 for validation the employed calibration approach follows calibration from upstream to downstream it fixes the calibrated upstream sub basins parameters and uses the downstream hydrological observation data to calibrate the downstream sub basins parameters an automatic algorithm pysot developed by eriksson et al 2019 was used to optimize the parameter values based on an objective function of nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 eq 3 3 nse 1 n 1 n q obs n q sim n 2 n 1 n q obs t q obs 2 where n is the total number of days in the evaluation period q obs n and q sim n represent the observed and simulated runoff on the n th day respectively q obs represents the average of observed runoff in the evaluation period 2 4 quantifying regional sediment composition with riverbed deposition the regional sediment composition refers to the percentage of ssl in a downstream section that comes from a certain upstream section to quantify the regional composition of sediment along a river a simple sectional ssl ratio method is often adopted which calculates the ratio of ssl at an upstream river section a over that at a downstream section b this ratio is assumed to represent the contribution ratio of the area draining to a at section b however this method may overestimate the upper regions sediment yield ratio and underestimate the lower regions ratio if significant sediment deposition occurs along the river course as discussed earlier the lmr experiences significant deposition in some river sections therefore the sectional ssl ratio method cannot reasonably reflect the sediment characteristics of the basin to better describe the regional sediment composition in the lmr basin with much deposition we propose a new index the ssl proportion rj i that is the ssl proportion of the s j section from the upstream region i the upstream basin of the section s i different from the sectional ssl ratio the ssl proportion takes account of sediment deposition along the river to illustrate the concept two consecutive cross sections i e s1 and s2 are defined in fig 2 representing the entrance and exit of a sub basin unit in fig 2 the sediment load of the s 1 and s 2 cross sections are l 1 and l 2 respectively the total sediment deposition from l 1 to l 2 is d 12 note that r i i 1 since we divide the number of regions and each region has a relatively small area and a relatively short river length each region can be considered as a micro element therefore we assume that the proportion of sediment transport from different regions is equal to the proportion of deposition in each region i e the proportion from l i in d 12 is equal to the proportion from l i in l 2 then we can reasonably assume the deposition amount of sediment originating from the region i be r 2 i d 12 in this way the ssl proportion r 2 i can be calculated as follows 4 r 2 i r 1 i l 1 r 2 i d 12 l 2 by reorganizing eq 4 we have 5 r 2 i r 1 i l 1 l 2 d 12 repeat the above procedure we can calculate the ssl proportion r j i for all the cross sections based on the threw model s distributed water and sediment simulations 2 5 analysis method for sediment dynamics and attribution before 2002 only the manwan dam was constructed in the lancang river while after 2003 the number of mega dams increased and jinghong xiaowan and nuozhadu dams were put into operation to investigate the sediment dynamics before 2002 first we used the mann kendal test m k test to identify the abrupt changes in ssc and the main influence regions of sediment processes in jinghong and mukdahan the m k test is composed of uf and ub curves and a 0 05 significance level line the uf and ub curves represent the changing trend of statistical data and calculate the abrupt change point respectively considering the critical value u0 05 of 1 96 a significant upward or downward trend occurs when the uf exceeds the critical value however the trend may or may not be linear if the intersection of the uf and ub curves is between the critical lines an abrupt change point occurs then we try to explore the dominant drivers of ssc dynamics such as climate change and human activities precipitation data can reflect the influence of natural factors on ssc and ndvi can reflect the influence of human activities on ssc the abrupt change of the ssc s dominant factors is determined by analyzing the long time data of ssc annual precipitation and annual ndvi since ndvi cannot completely reflect the influence of human activities for example if the land use changes from cropland to grassland or woodland ndvi may have little change but ssc may be significantly different therefore we also used lulc data to analyze the impact of human activities on ssc and explored the possible additional abrupt change limited by the observed ssc data the calibration method used for sediment parameters is as follows from 1968 to 1971 the measured ssc of jinghong chiang sean chiang khan and mukdahan stations were successively used to calibrate the sediment module parameters by the nested approach the measured sediment data of jinghong and mukdahan stations were then used to calibrate the sediment parameters of the other times the calibration procedure is shown in table 1 1 calibrate the parameters of higher forest coverage and lower sediment yield in the late 1960 s 2 calibrate the parameters of the highest sediment yield of the lancang river from 1992 to 1994 3 calibrate the parameters in the early 2000s during which the soil and water conservation decreasing the sediment yield in the lancang river while the forest coverage area of the mekong river basin continued to decrease and the sediment yield increased the specific reasons for adopting the given calibration approach can be found in section 3 4 according to the time of abrupt change of ssc dominant factors we extended the parameters of the calibration periods to 1968 2002 to simulate the natural sediment process under the actual lulc variation for the area above jinghong station the parameters for all years in the climate factor dominated period are a1 the parameters of the lulc factor dominated period before soil and water conservation are uniformly transitioned from a1 to a2 and the parameters of the lulc factor dominated period after soil and water conservation are uniformly transitioned from a2 to a3 similarly for the area between jinghong and mukdahan stations the parameters are b1 for all years in the climate factor dominated phase and b2 for all years in the lulc factor dominated phase the extended parameters are used for model simulation and attribution analysis in the attribution analysis section we use the control variables method through comparing different scenarios dominated by different drivers i e climate change lulc change and human activities we analyze the response of the sediment processes to each driver in the lmr 3 results 3 1 hydrological model calibration and validation table 2 gives information on the developed model s performance based on the nse values of four hydrological stations for daily runoff two periods were selected 1968 to 1977 for calibration and 1978 to 2002 for validation while limited by the sediment observation data we only calculate the nse values of monthly ssl at jinghong and mukdahan stations the calibration periods for jinghong station are 1968 1972 1992 1994 and 2000 2002 and the validation periods are 1973 1991 and 1995 1999 the calibration periods for the mukdahan station are 1968 1972 and 2000 2002 and the validation period for the mukdahan station is 1973 1999 the yielded nses show the relatively high efficiency of the developed model in sediment and runoff simulation fig 3 a and b show the simulation results of the monthly ssl between 1968 and 2002 and the normalized simulated and measured monthly ssl values for mukdahan and jinghong stations respectively the yielded results shown in fig 3 highlight that the model has well predicted most of the measured values the closer the values to the line the greater the model s accuracy in the scatter plot fig 3b comparing the predicted and observed monthly ssl values shows that the developed model can predict low mid and high monthly ssl values with high accuracy despite some discrepancies in high values see fig 3a note that the ssl values of the jinghong station were not allowed to be present due to data security policy 3 2 regional sediment balance table 3 gives information on the sediment characteristics for upstream of the jinghong station and the areas between jinghong chiang sean chiang sean chiang khan and chiang khan mukdahan stations see fig 1 for the location of the stations the yielded annual ssl from 1968 to 2002 increased from the upper regions to lower regions i e jinghong to mukdahan with a more pronounced increase attributed to after the chiang sean station the results reveal that the area between jinghong chiang sean insignificantly increased the annual ssl compared to the areas located upstream of the mukdahan station the same trend is also observed for sediment deposition however the highest deposition is attributed to the area between chiang khan and mukdahan with 11 million tonnes interestingly the most significant sediment yield is obtained in the upper region of the jinghong station followed by areas between chiang khan mukdahan chiang sean chiang khan and jinghong chiang sean based on such characteristics and limited by the observed sediment data of the mekong river the following analysis of the sediment process is mainly focused on the two cross sections of jinghong and mukdahan stations and the sediment module parameter calibration in the threw model also mainly adopts the sediment data provided by jinghong and mukdahan stations fig 4 illustrates the annual ssl change for mukdahan station over the investigated period i e 1968 to 2002 despite some reductions compared to 1968 the annual ssl experienced a fluctuating upward trend such fluctuations seem to be induced by lulc changes and climate variations e g in annual rainfall as no mega dam was constructed during the period particularly between 1968 and 1995 the most significant reduction is attributed to 1992 after 1995 although the annual ssl experienced some drops the annual ssl remained virtually higher than that of 1968 highlighting the insignificant influence of the operated dams on the annual ssl in the area during this period 3 3 sediment deposition onto the riverbed while sediment deposition research has mainly focused on the lower mekong wang et al 2011 manh et al 2014 research addressing the role of the upper mekong with deposition prone riverbeds and how the upper sub basins influence the sediment deposition is limited as a complex natural channel with an island in the dry season the chiang sean station s cross section is illustrated in fig 5 a due to the measured data scarcity of this cross section in different periods the rating curve water level discharge relationship change can roughly reflect the river s natural deposition fig 5b and c show the double mass curve and scatter plot of observed daily water level vs discharge respectively between 1993 and 2002 in this period the slope of the double mass curve of daily water level vs discharge decreased as shown in fig 5b also as illustrated in fig 5c during the low flow period in the dry season the water level corresponding to the same discharge has increased by around 1 m indicating continuous sediment deposition in the riverbed 3 4 sediment dynamics and driving factors fig 6 a and c illustrate the variation trend of the measured ssc in the jinghong and mukdahan stations from 1968 to 2002 respectively the abrupt time change of ssc in jinghong is 1978 where the uf and ub curves intersect in the 95 significant interval for mukdahan station 1985 is the changing point where its ssc s downward trend changes to an upward trend revealing that the ssc changes in jinghong and mukdahan stations are not synchronous the analyses shown in fig 6a and c reveal that the ssc changes in jinghong and mukdahan stations are mainly influenced by areas above jinghong and the area between jinghong and mukdahan stations respectively therefore in the following analysis we use the trends of ssc at jinghong and mukdahan stations to reflect the sediment dynamics of the area above jinghong station and the area between jinghong and mukdahan stations respectively fig 6b and d show the uf statistics of annual rainfall annual maximum ndvi and ssc for the areas above jinghong station and between jinghong and mukdahan stations the variation trend of the ssc for the area above jinghong station from 1968 to 1984 was virtually similar to that of rainfall indicating that rainfall was the dominant factor in ssc in this period we refer to 1968 1984 as the climate factor dominated period from 1984 to 1993 the ssc increased while the rainfall slightly decreased implying that rainfall was not the dominant factor over this period from 1984 to 2002 the ssc of jinghong first increased and then dropped which is highly consistent with the trend of ndvi it is seen that the dominant factor of ssc of jinghong has changed from rainfall to land cover since 1984 thus we refer to 1984 2002 as the lulc factor dominated period in conclusion ssc s dominant factor in the area above jinghong station changed from rainfall to land cover and the change point was in 1984 similarly from 1968 to 1982 the ssc in mukdahan station and the precipitation in the area between jinghong and mukdahan stations decreased with the same trend indicating that the dominant factor affecting the ssc of mukdahan station during this period was rainfall we call 1968 1982 a climate factor dominated period from 1982 to 2002 the rainfall remained almost constant while the ssc in mukdahan stations showed an upward trend highlighting that rainfall was no longer the dominant factor regarding the ndvi trend from 1982 to 2002 no significant change occurred however according to lulc data provided by the earth science center tsinghua university in fig 7 a a large area of the forest in the mrb was changed into grasslands and farmlands in the late 1980 s exacerbating soil erosion in this area thus the lulc change in the area between jinghong and mukdahan stations appeared to be the dominant factor for ssc after 1982 we refer to 1982 2002 as the lulc factor dominated period with the change point of 1982 the dominant factor changed from rainfall to lulc in the area between mukdahan and jinghong stations over the study period climate change has certain spatial variability which makes the timing of the abrupt change of the ssc s dominant factor not to be exactly consistent in different stations the abrupt change of the ssc s dominant factor in jinghong station occurred in 1984 while in mukdahan station occurred in 1982 therefore it s reasonable to consider 1984 as the timing of the abrupt change of the ssc s dominant factor in the areas above jinghong stations and between jinghong and mukdahan stations fig 7b shows that the peak number of barren lands was reached in 1993 mainly distributed in the upper part of the lancang river barren land has the lowest surface erosion resistance compared to other land use types especially upstream of lancang river where the slope is relatively large gyssels et al 2005 this led to a high level of ssl at jinghong station in 1993 fig 6b therefore the abrupt change for the region above jinghong station occurred in 1993 when the sediment yield of the lancang river was the highest in the early 2000 s the soil and water conservation project in the lancang river basin took effect thus its sediment yield decreased while the mekong river basin forest cover continued to decrease and its sediment yield increased therefore the year 2002 is considered as an abrupt change and also the end of the study period 3 5 attribution analysis of sediment characteristics according to the above analysis abrupt changes occurred in 1984 1993 and 2002 the model uses the values observed in each year in two different series notated a and b the values in each series for 1984 1993 and 2002 are denoted 1 2 and 3 respectively the parameters for the years between each value in each series are determined using an arithmetic sequence method for the region above jinghong station the model parameters for 1968 1983 are a1 for 1984 1993 are from a1 to a2 and for 1994 2002 are from a2 to a3 for the area between jinghong and mukdahan stations the model parameters are b1 for 1968 1983 and for 1984 2002 are from b1 to b2 using the control variables method we simulate the ssl changes resulting from each driver change and thus obtain the contribution of different influencing factors to the ssl changes we set up four scenarios to study the contribution ratio of climate change and lulc factors to the annual mean ssl change for different periods in different regions the scenario design and results are given in table 4 scenario 1 fixes the lulc in the lmr in the late 1960 s to analyze the impacts of rainfall changes on the ssl of jinghong and mukdahan stations from 1968 to 2002 scenario 2 analyzes the impacts of lulc changes on the ssl of jinghong and mukdahan stations and the region between jinghong and mukdahan stations from 1968 to 2002 scenarios 3 and 4 analyze the impacts of lulc changes in the area above jinghong station on the ssl of jinghong and mukdahan stations for 1968 1992 and 1993 2002 respectively from 1968 to 2002 rainfall change decreased jinghong and mukdahan s ssl by 23 and 34 respectively at the same time lulc change in the upstream region of jinghong increased jinghong and mukdahan s ssl by 14 and 8 respectively while a more significant increase was attributed to the area between jinghong and mukdahan where mukdahan s ssl increased by 56 it is seen that from 1968 to 2002 for the mukdahan section the greatest impact on ssl change was land cover in the area between jinghong and mukdahan the second significant impact was attributed to rainfall 4 discussion extensive research has been conducted to address the sedimentation process along lmr mainly using measured data discontinuous and sporadic data satellite images and rating curves zhang et al 2014 unverricht et al 2014 dang et al 2018a b research into exploring spatio temporal patterns of sediment load and driving factors in lmr before the operation of mega dams 1968 2002 is limited and most researchers have focused on the lower mekong basin wang et al 2011 manh et al 2015 demaster et al 2017 dang et al 2018a b shrestha et al 2018 from chiang sean towards mekong delta since related data was unavailable lu and siew 2006 this research provides additional insights into the role of the chinese part on the lower mekong s sediment characteristics and sediment deposition in different areas for example the annual ssl from 1968 to 2002 increased from the upper regions to lower regions i e jinghong to mukdahan with a more pronounced increase attributed to areas after the chiang sean station we also found that the ssl for the area between jinghong and chiang sean remained almost constant the highest sediment deposition was attributed to the area between chiang khan and mukdahan for mukdahan station the present study reported the continuous annual ssl for the years 1968 to 2002 while walling 2008 and lu and siew 2006 presented the yearly ssl only for years with high data quality however the pattern obtained was consistent despite discrepancies in obtained values which can be attributed to the more samples used in this study to develop the sediment module as well as the defined sediment deposition index conducted works reported that the ssc trend experienced a declining trend for the pre dam period for the lower mekong course however this study found a significant upward trend after 1978 for jinghong station s annual ssc contradicting the findings reported by lu and siew 2006 concerning the negative role of manwan dam on the chiang sean station research reported no similar trend for the ssc change from station to station lu and siew 2006 kummu and varis 2007 fu et al 2008 xue et al 2011 which was further supported in the present work however crucial additional insights were provided in this work by attributing the role of land use and land cover changes and precipitation to the yielded ssc at various stations for example the land use and land cover change e g deforestation to develop grasslands and farmlands of the area between jinghong and mukdahan stations appeared to be the dominant driver for ssc after 1982 the dominant factor changed from rainfall to land cover in the mukdahan and jinghong stations over the study period the contribution of rainfall and land cover to the mean annual ssl was also investigated from 1968 to 2002 the most significant impact on ssl change was land cover in the area between jinghong and mukdahan a 56 increase for mukdahan s ssl the second significant impact was attributed to rainfall 5 conclusions to address the spatial composition of sediment sediment dynamics and driving factors influencing the sediment process in the lmr a distributed hydrological model coupled with a sediment module was developed to reconstruct the sediment process of the lmr a new index to quantify the regional composition of the sediment was also developed to present and analyze the results of the sediment characteristics quantitively six hydrological stations including mukdahan jinghong gajiu chiang sean chiang khan and jiuzhou were considered in the developed model the major findings are as follows 1 the results showed that sediment contribution from the upstream sub basins would be overestimated if sediment deposition was ignored for example the results corresponding to the newly developed index i e ssl proportion indicated that the annual average ssl proportion of the upper region of jinghong to mukdahan was 50 4 while the cross sectional ssl ratio of jinghong and mukdahan was 64 9 2 temporal trends of ssc in the gajiu jinghong and mukdahan stations were different no correlation was found between these three stations this means that farther upstream subbasins did not play a significant role and the closer the subbasin to the cross section the greater the impact of ssl 3 although the temporal trends were different the dominant factors were the same before the early 1980 s the dominant factor of jinghong and mukdahan s ssc was rainfall while after the 1980 s it was land cover 4 for the area between jinghong to mukdahan land cover change had the most significant impact on the ssl from 1968 to 2002 followed by rainfall the results also highlighted that land cover change in jinghong s upper region slightly impacted the ssl credit authorship contribution statement fuqiang tian conceptualization investigation resources data curation writing review editing supervision

2537,baseflow plays an important role in sustaining the ecosystem during dry seasons or in arid regions and its spatiotemporal variations greatly influence the stability of ecosystem because of climate change and the revegetation project the streamflow has been reported to significantly decrease in past decades in china s loess plateau clp however the changes in streamflow components have not been fully investigated the objective of this study is thus to detect and attribute the changes in baseflow in the clp using data of 55 hydrological stations for 1956 1990 and 2001 2019 the geographic detector correlation analysis and elasticity coefficient methods were employed to qualitatively and quantitively analyze the influence of various factors on baseflow the baseflow accounts for 35 76 of streamflow the baseflow in 85 of hydrological stations decreased by 10 while the baseflow index bfi of 82 hydrological stations showed an upward trend precipitation and hydrogeological condition e g loess thickness were likely to dominate the spatial heterogeneity of baseflow while the potential evapotranspiration population sub surface runoff ndvi and soil water were responsible for the decrease in baseflow with contributions of 27 21 17 16 and 16 respectively the consistence or inconsistence between baseflow and bfi as well as their relations to environmental changes provide new insights into the changes in hydrological processes keywords streamflow component spatiotemporal variation regional environmental factors attribution analysis revegetation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction baseflow is the streamflow component coming from groundwater or other delayed sources which reflects the relationship between surface water and groundwater hall 1968 baseflow maintains the basic flow of rivers in periods of no precipitation and drought miller et al 2016 and thus plays a positive role in maintaining the seasonal distribution of streamflow and maintaining aquatic habitats hare et al 2021 rivett et al 2011 understanding the spatiotemporal variations in baseflow is vital for management of water resources and ecosystems due to the differences in regional conditions and human activities the baseflow has strong spatiotemporal heterogeneity on the global scale the high values of annual baseflow 5000 m3 s mostly occur in north america and south america and low annual baseflow in africa and europe in recent decades the hydrological stations with significant downward trend are 1 3 times of those with increasing trend and the downward trend is mostly detected in south america australia and asia tan et al 2020 to reveal the reasons for variability of baseflow it is essential to determine the controlling factors of baseflow baseflow is influenced by both surface and subsurface characteristics including climate soil groundwater vegetation and topography segura et al 2019 theoretically baseflow increases with increasing rainfall soil infiltration rate and groundwater recharge but decreases with increasing evapotranspiration brutsaert 2005 price 2011 vegetation may influence baseflow by changing interception and evapotranspiration bonneau et al 2018 feng et al 2016 for example vegetation interception has decreased precipitation passing rates by up to 15 over central and northwest north america central and east asia murray 2014 while the earth s greening has increased terrestrial evapotranspiration by 12 0 2 4 mm year 1 zeng et al 2018 on the other hand vegetation can increase baseflow by improving soil permeability and increasing groundwater recharge rumsey et al 2015 topographic features e g elevation slope and basin shape determine how much precipitation flows into river or remains in soils during rainfall events rumsey et al 2015 segura et al 2019 and they mainly affect the spatial variations in baseflow the above factors combine to influence the variability of baseflow and their effects should be comprehensively considered analysis of baseflow change is crucial for dry regions with substantial environmental changes the clp is the largest loess covered area with the thickest loess up to 350 m deep in the world xiong et al 2014 zhu et al 2018 the resultant huge reservoirs for soil water and groundwater have been reported to greatly influence vegetation carrying capacity and catchment scale hydrological processes huang 2019 to control the severe soil loss the grain for green project initiated from 1999 has converted large areas of farmland to forestland and grassland subsequently the sediment concentration has been reported to decrease by 21 and the runoff coefficients has decreased by 26 wang et al 2015 with subhumid to arid climates the decrease in streamflow will exacerbate water shortage and has thus been largely investigated li et al 2016b li et al 2019 however the changes in streamflow components have rarely been considered especially for baseflow therefore it is urgent to explore the changes in baseflow to provide a theoretical basis for the sustainability of water resources and vegetation taking the clp as an example study area the overall goal of this study is to detect and attribute the spatiotemporal variations in baseflow in dry regions with substantial environmental changes specifically we will ask the following questions i what changes have occurred to baseflow and related environmental factors ii which factor dominates the spatial and temporal variations of baseflow we will estimate the baseflow of 55 hydrological stations in eight basins and analyze the dominant factors by the geographical detector correlation analysis and elasticity coefficient methods fundamentally this study will fully reveal the spatiotemporal variations in baseflow and their dominant factors which will contribute to understanding of subsurface hydrological processes in a changing environment for application our study can potentially support how to balance the afforestation and water resource management in the loess plateau and similar regions in the world 2 data and methods 2 1 study area the clp is located in the middle and upper reaches of the yellow river with an area of 640 000 km2 the elevation decreases from northwest to southeast it transits from subhumid to arid climates with mean annual temperature of 3 7 14 0 and mean annual rainfall of 144 812 mm with 72 of annual precipitation falling from june to september li et al 2012 zhang et al 2020 the land use mainly includes farmland forestland and grassland accounting for 32 15 and 42 of the total area li et al 2016a the vegetation coverage decreases from southeast to northwest the revegetation project greatly improved vegetation coverage and the increasing rates of ndvi in 2000 2015 were 10 times of those in 1982 1999 mainly because of human activities li et al 2017 the hydrogeological conditions are very similar across the whole study areas most of the area is covered by the quaternary loess which contains three layers the top layer is the malan loess formed in the upper pleistocen 10 30 m thick the intermediate layer is the lishi loess formed in the middle pleistocene 100 150 m thick serving as the aquifer for the relatively high porosity the bottom layer is the wucheng loess formed in the lower pleistocene 22 78 m thick serving as aquitard due to the low permeability however the thickness of loess varies spatially from 0 to 350 m thick which may influence groundwater storage xiong et al 2014 zhu et al 2018 the porosity of loess is generally up to 45 50 and the large pores are prominent the water table depth fluctuates between 30 and 100 m below the soil surface with complicated natural conditions and anthropogenic impacts the hydrological processes have been changing significantly in recent decades and the downward trend has been reported for most hydrological variables gao et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 zhao et al 2017 considering the above conditions eight basins with significant changes in streamflow and environmental factors will be selected for this study fig 1 the basins have areas ranging from 3 253 to 105 350 km2 accounting for 53 of the loess covered area these basins span strong climatic and topographic gradients longitudinally from north to south of the clp table 1 shows the details of the eight catchments and the variation in hydrometeorological variables 2 2 data collection we selected streamflow data from 55 hydrological stations located at the outlet of the whole basin key cross sections of the river and outlet of important tributaries they cover different reaches of the same river and variable natural conditions of different rivers fig 1 as such the selected stations can fully reflect the hydrological conditions of the eight basins and the loess plateau the reliability and consistency of the data have been strictly controlled by ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china due to data availability we can only obtain daily data series for 1956 1990 and 2001 2019 however in general every 8 12 years of runoff process contain a complete abundance and depletion of hydrological years and the error caused by periodic interannual variation of runoff can be ignored on the time scale of at least 10 years in the clp dai et al 2016 geng et al 2021 shao et al 2021 yoo 2006 the data length of the two periods is at least 14 years and the current two periods well represent hydrological conditions before and after the revegetation project initiated in 1999 as such the inter period changes in streamflow can be linked with environmental changes because of human activities the generation of baseflow includes several processes in the atmosphere vadose zones and saturated zones specifically the precipitation from the atmosphere provides the source water and then it infiltrates through the vadose zones to the saturated zones and finally discharges into the river in the form of baseflow in consequence precipitation soil water and groundwater are hydrological variables directly influencing inputs but evapotranspiration is the main output a lot of factors may directly or indirectly influence the above hydrological variables for example from the atmosphere to the underground it may include climate vegetation topography soil and geology however on catchment scale and for a short period the soil topography and geology would change little we thus directly select the above hydrological variables and environmental factors including climate and vegetation specifically they include precipitation potential evapotranspiration ndvi volumetric soil water and sub surface runoff in addition human activities may have great impacts on groundwater it is better to give the exact number of groundwater withdraw and return of irrigation however on one hand there is no such data or these data are hard to be obtained on the other hand they can be indirectly by the population we thus used population as an index of human activities to analyze anthropogenic impacts on baseflow daily meteorological data of 60 meteorological stations were collected from china meteorology administration https data cma cn the spatially averaged meteorological data of each sub basin were generated by the kriging interpolation in addition to attribute the changes in baseflow we collected potential evapotranspiration et0 from terraclimate dataset with a spatial resolution of 0 05 0 05 https www climatologylab org terraclimate html

post and jakeman 1996 the cumulative areas of tree replantation in 1959 1969 1979 1989 1999 and 2006 were collected from liang et al 2015 and gao et al 2016 2 3 baseflow separation methods as baseflow cannot be directly measured it is mostly separated from the observed streamflow by some methods to obtain the best estimates of baseflow this study compared eight methods including two bfi baseflow index standard and modified methods three hysep hydrograph separation program fixed interval sliding interval and local minimum methods part two digital filters lyne hollick one parameter filter and eckhardt two parameter filter details about baseflow separation methods can be found in the original papers eckhardt 2005 hydrology 1980 lyne and hollick 1979 nathan and mcmahon 1990 sloto and crouse 1996 rutledge 1998 wahl and wahl 1988 and they were briefly summarized as follows bfi divides the daily streamflow series into many equal intervals identifies the turning point in each interval and connects the turning points to obtain the baseflow hydrograph hydrology 1980 the turning point in bfi standard or bfi modified is determined by multiplying the lowest streamflow value in an interval by the turning point test factor or daily recession index respectively hydrology 1980 wahl and wahl 1988 hysep calculates surface runoff duration based on an empirical relation and then uses twice the number of days after which surface runoff ceases as the interval to estimate baseflow the baseflow is further separated by three methods hysep fixed hysep slide hysep locmin sloto and crouse 1996 part separate the baseflow based on antecedent streamflow recession rutledge 1998 if daily streamflow values decrease for n or more days and the streamflow never decreases by 0 1 log cycle as the baseflow other daily baseflow is determined by linear interpolation lyne hollick and eckhardt were used for one parameter digital filter method and two parameter digital filter method respectively eckhardt 2005 lyne and hollick 1979 nathan and mcmahon 1990 the filtering techniques filter the high frequency signals in the streamflow record associated with surface runoff from the low frequency signals associated with groundwater discharge as baseflow compared with lyne hollick eckhardt limits the maximum ratio of baseflow to streamflow as baseflow is a relatively stable component of streamflow yao et al 2021 the stability or reliability of separated baseflow is usually used as standard to select the best baseflow separation method in this study annual bfi was used to determine the stability we thus calculated the standard deviation and extreme value ratio of bfi series for t1 and t2 at 55 stations extreme value ratio is ratio of maximum minus minimum to minimum in addition strict baseflow points were selected as the measured baseflow in daily streamflow series and compared with baseflow obtained by eight baseflow separation methods the reliability of different baseflow separation methods were evaluated by calculating nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and kling gupta efficiency kge respectively details of this method can be found in xie et al 2020 2 4 interpreting spatial variation in baseflow the geographical detector is a tool to detect and utilize spatial diversity and includes four detectors wang et al 2010 the factor detector was employed to explore the factors dominating the spatial variations in baseflow specifically the factor detection is a quantitative technique that determines whether the spatial distribution of a dependent variable is similar to that of an independent variable the similarity is represented by the value of q with a range of 0 1 and the explanatory power of the independent variable to dependent variable is stronger when q is closer to 1 1 q 1 h 1 l n h œÉ h 2 n œÉ 2 where h 1 l is the stratification of variable h and n are the number of units in stratification h and the entire area respectively œÉ h 2 and œÉ 2 are the variances of dependent variable of stratification h and entire area respectively in this study the values of baseflow and bfi were used as dependent variable whereas p ssr vsw ndvi ti et0 bs served as independent variables to explore the factors dominating the variations in baseflow 2 5 attributing baseflow change the elasticity coefficient method was used to quantify the contribution of each factor to baseflow change the total change in baseflow Œ¥b tot is the difference of mean baseflow between two time periods 2 Œ¥ b tot b t 2 b t 1 the total change in baseflow can be partitioned into components representing contributions of different factors 3 Œ¥ b tot Œ¥ b 1 Œ¥ b 2 Œ¥ b 3 where Œ¥ b 1 Œ¥ b 2 Œ¥ b 3 are the changes of baseflow caused by different controlling factors according to the principle of elasticity coefficient method Œ¥ b i can be expressed as 4 Œ¥ b i Œµ i Œ¥ x i x i b where x i is the mean annual value of the i th controlling factor Œµi is the elasticity coefficient of x i in this study the least square estimation was used to estimate the elasticity of annual baseflow to environmental factors zheng et al 2009 5 Œµ i b b x i x i œÅ b x i c b c x i where œÅ b x i is the correlation coefficient between baseflow and environmental factors c x i and c b are the coefficients of variation of environmental factors and baseflow respectively the contribution p i of the i th factor to the change of baseflow can be calculated as follows 6 p i Œ¥ b i 1 n Œ¥ b i 100 where n is the number of factors 3 results 3 1 selected baseflow separation method the results of the standard deviation fig 2 a 2b and extreme value ratio fig 2c 2d of the bfi series for t1 and t2 showed that the median mean and quantile of standard deviation extreme value ratio of bfi sequence from the eckhardt method were the lowest as such the eckhardt method presented the most stable baseflow in the clp further the calculated nsh fig 2e and kge fig 2f showed that for eight baseflow separation methods the eckhardt method had the largest nse mean 0 93 and median 0 97 and its kge mean 0 84 and median 0 87 were only second to part therefore the eckhardt method had the best performance in identifying baseflow overall the eckhardt method had the best stability and reliability for baseflow separation in the clp in the following sections the baseflow time series from the eckhardt method will be employed for further analysis 3 2 spatial and temporal variability of baseflow the mean annual baseflow ranged from 18 fen river to 75 mm tuwei river with an average of 31 20 mm while the mean annual bfi ranged from 0 54 yan river to 0 73 tuwei river with an average of 0 64 0 06 from t1 to t2 the mean annual baseflow and bfi changed by 36 13 and 7 9 respectively the changes in baseflow were more variable than those in bfi spatially the basins in the south and the north had higher baseflow than those in the middle fig 3 a for example the mean annual baseflow in the tuwei river north and the wei river south were respectively 75 and 43 mm but the values in the yan and fen river middle were about 18 mm over all the sub basins the baseflow of 71 of hydrological stations were 40 mm the bfi varied great in space fig 3b and the bfi of 78 of hydrological stations ranged between 0 5 and 0 7 within each basin from upper to lower reaches the baseflow in the north varied less but the baseflow in the south varied drastically and the spatial variability in baseflow and bfi was similar fig 3c temporally the mean annual baseflow overall decreased significantly by 19 57 from t1 to t2 fig 4 a b but the decrease varied with rivers the fen and kuye river had the largest decrease of 57 and 52 while the yan and wuding river had the smallest decrease of 20 respectively over all the sub basins the baseflow in 69 of hydrological stations decreased by 20 fig 4c but the trend of bfi was opposite to that of baseflow since 82 of stations showed an upward trend fig 4d 3 3 spatiotemporal variability in environmental factors the spatial distribution of each environmental factor was shown in fig 5 p ndvi vsw and ssr increased from northwest to southeast but other factors had complicated variability specifically ti was high in the north but low in the south et0 was the highest in the fen river and the lowest in the wei river bs existed little spatial variability the thickness of loess decreased from central to southeast and northwest temporally the mann kendell test showed that p in 96 of the sub basins has insignificant trend fig 5a et0 and ndvi showed significant upward trend in all basins fig 5b c but ssr and vsw had decreased significantly in 87 and 80 of sub basins respectively fig 5d e the percentage change of ssr was the largest 45 22 followed by ndvi 24 13 the percentage changes of other factors were all within 20 3 4 dominance of environmental factors on baseflow the results of factor detector showed that p was the most important factor controlling the spatial variation of baseflow with q value of 0 89 followed by ssr 0 84 vsw 0 82 and ndvi 0 70 each factor passed the significance test p 0 05 in addition the spatial distribution of baseflow and loess thickness data is not available was similar which was high in the central and low in the north and south fig 3a fig 5h therefore the loess thickness may have an important influence on the spatial distribution of baseflow but for the spatial variability of bfi all factors failed to pass the significance test implying that the spatial variability in bfi was more complicated than baseflow the pearson correlation analysis was used to connect the time series of baseflow with environmental factors e g p et0 ndvi ssr and vsw in most sub basins baseflow was positively correlated with p ssr and vsw but negatively related to et0 and ndvi fig 6 the abovementioned relationships were significant at 35 hydrological stations except for ndvi at 14 stations however the controlling factors of bfi appeared different from baseflow bfi was negatively correlated with p and vsw but positively correlated with et0 ndvi and ssr however these relationships were insignificant at most hydrological stations the number of stations with significant bfi ndvi relationship was the largest 23 followed by bfi et0 17 and bfi p 15 3 5 contribution of environmental factors to baseflow reduction the elasticity coefficients of baseflow to environmental factors in eight basins were shown in fig 7 the multi basin mean Œµ p ranging from 0 02 to 2 17 Œµ et 0 1 83 to 5 49 Œµ ndvi 0 21 to 2 50 Œµ ssr 0 07 to 0 79 Œµ vsw 0 54 to 5 30 and Œµ populatin 0 19 to 2 79 were 1 12 4 06 1 15 0 39 3 49 and 1 29 respectively these results suggest that a 1 increase in p et0 ndvi ssr vsw and population would cause the baseflow to change 1 12 4 06 1 15 0 39 3 49 and 1 29 respectively accordingly the baseflow was most sensitive to et0 averaged over the eight basins the elasticity coefficient method showed that the contributions to baseflow change were the largest for et0 27 and population 21 intermediate for ssr 17 ndvi 16 and vsw 16 and the smallest for p 2 however the factors dominating baseflow reduction varied with basins fig 7 specifically et0 had the greatest contributions in the kuye wuding yan and fen river population in the tuwei and jing river vsw in the beiluo and ssr in the wei river had the largest contributions respectively 4 discussion 4 1 rationality of selection of baseflow separation method our evaluation of reliability of baseflow separation results showed that the eckhardt method performed the best many studies have considered the stability of baseflow as an indicator for method selection beck et al 2013 eckhardt 2008 eckhardt 2012 lott and stewart 2016 to further evaluate the reliability of baseflow separation methods the estimated and simulated dry season low flows have been compared longobardi and villani 2008 smakhtin 2001 tan et al 2020 or the minimum daily streamflow values are usually selected as measured baseflow furey and gupta 2001 novita and wahyuningsih 2016 however the former procedure tends to underestimate baseflow while the latter cannot be widely used it is more reasonable to select strict baseflow points with uniform distribution in dry and wet periods as measured baseflow based on daily streamflow data xie et al 2020 this study used this method to combine the stability of baseflow to identify the best baseflow separation method the framework can provide suggestions for the selection of baseflow separation methods in the clp and other regions 4 2 why does baseflow vary spatiotemporally spatially the mean annual baseflow in the southern and northern basins were larger than the middle fig 3a all the environmental factors considered in this study had significant effects on the spatial divergence of baseflow p 0 05 but precipitation was likely to be the dominant factor precipitation is the water input for baseflow formation and the higher the intensity and frequency of rainfall the larger the baseflow cartwright and morgenstern 2015 koskelo et al 2012 wittenberg et al 2019 the clp is a water limited region with an annual average precipitation of 382 mm year 1 huang et al 2008 and the spatial pattern of hydrological components e g runoff soil water and groundwater recharge is thus dominated by that of precipitation hu et al 2019 huang 2019 lal 2004 zhao et al 2017 as the rainfall is mainly controlled by the east asian summer monsoon the spatial pattern of precipitation and hydrological components are thus overall decreasing from southeast to northwest hu et al 2019 wang et al 2019 yan et al 2018 however the spatial pattern of baseflow may be perturbed by the loess thickness specifically the loess is the thickest in the middle and decreases to the south and north the regions with thick loess can store more water in the aquifers and the precipitation would discharge into streamflow more slowly through the subsurface hydrological processes it implied that precipitation and hydrogeological condition e g loess thickness overall determine the spatial pattern of baseflow temporally the changes in et0 population ssr ndvi and vsw caused a significant reduction in baseflow and contributed 27 21 17 16 and 16 to the reduction respectively fig 7 precipitation overall dominates baseflow formation but the precipitation has not changed significantly over the past decades fig 5a a such the precipitation may have little impacts on the temporal changes in baseflow feng et al 2016 su and shangguan 2019 the increasing evapotranspiration population and ndvi as well as the decreasing ssr and vsw greatly contributed to the decreased baseflow in the clp fig 7 the negative correlation between evapotranspiration and baseflow and the positive correlation between groundwater soil water and baseflow have been confirmed in many regions of the world ficklin et al 2016 mukherjee et al 2018 niswonger and fogg 2008 tashie et al 2020 in the clp the evapotranspiration significantly increased and ssr vsw significantly decreased fig 5 it is thus reasonable to conclude the impacts of evapotranspiration and ssr and vsw on baseflow change along with the rapid rise in population the rapid increase in regional water demand has led to more serious baseflow reduction camacho et al 2022 smith et al 2018 wang and cai 2009 in addition a large number of ecological restoration projects have been carried out in the eight basins from 1959 to 2006 the average area of check dams in the eight basins increased from 2 to 111 km2 and terraces from 37 to 2947 km2 gao et al 2016 liang et al 2015 terraces and check dams intercepted and stored precipitation and streamflow increased soil infiltration and soil water storage which can slow down the baseflow reduction to some extent han et al 2019 wei et al 2019 zhang et al 2008 therefore in addition to large scale vegetation reconstruction human activities have a great impact on baseflow because of data availability we do not have data for the period of 1991 2000 which is a period of rapid growth of groundwater withdrawal especially in the inner mongolia but only about 6 of the study area is located in inner mongolia in particular the shanxi and shaanxi experienced a rapid growth in groundwater withdrawal from the 1980 s and gansu for 1970 2000 ma et al 2022 shaanxi institute of geo environment monitoring 2016 shen et al 2022 our data periods have overlap with the abovementioned periods for groundwater withdrawal in addition groundwater withdrawal can be indirectly reflected by population and we employed population as an impact factor the relationship between increased vegetation and decreased baseflow is more complex and will be discussed in the following section 4 3 effects of vegetation on baseflow variability land use change can profoundly affect hydrological cycle and different land use types may exert different impacts on baseflow aboelnour et al 2021 ahiablame et al 2017 the grain for green project initiated in 1999 has greatly increased forestland but decreased agricultural land and grassland chen et al 2015 fu et al 2011 liu et al 2008 in particular the preferred plants for revegetation are often fast growing and deep rooted species gao et al 2020 li et al 2021 as shown in fig 8 a the tree plantation rates after 1999 were 4 times of the past the increase of vegetation and its feedback led to the depletion of baseflow in areas with limited water resources tan et al 2020 trancoso et al 2017 the baseflow of the clp continued to decrease and baseflow of typical basins decreased with the increase of vegetation until it reached a steady state when the vegetation coverage reaches 60 70 wu et al 2019 zhang et al 2022 the baseflow gradually decreases with the increase of forestland in these water limited regions the water resources can hardly sustain the planted trees to survive these trees have to pump water from soils subsequently the increased evapotranspiration induced dry soils can decrease water infiltration and groundwater recharge to greatly perturb the subsurface hydrological processes cao et al 2011 feng et al 2017 liu et al 2008 the changes in et0 ssr and vsw confirmed the significant impacts of vegetation on hydrological cycle and baseflow we further employed ndvi to examine the impacts of vegetation on baseflow the relationship between ndvi and hydrological factors in the clp showed that increasing ndvi leads to increasing et0 and decreasing vsw and ssr fig 8b the positive ndvi et0 relationship was significant in most basins except for the wuding river and significant negative ndvi ssr and ndvi vsw relationships existed in more than half of the basins therefore the revegetation may have great impacts on the baseflow reduction 4 4 implications to sustainable water resources management baseflow is an important component of streamflow hodgkins and dudley 2011 miller et al 2016 it accounts for 35 76 of the streamflow in the clp fig 3b and have played an important role in maintaining river morphology and ecological functions cheng and li 2021 cheng et al 2019 however 85 of hydrological stations had a baseflow reduction of 10 fig 4c in this study we found that the increased ndvi and et0 as well as decreased ssr were responsible for the baseflow reduction fig 6 fig 7 however et0 and ssr were significantly correlated with ndvi in most basins fig 8b the above results highlight that the direct or indirect role of vegetation change in baseflow reduction should not be underestimated as mentioned in previous studies the revegetation is approaching the limits of sustainable water resources in the clp bryan et al 2018 feng et al 2016 ma et al 2019 wu et al 2020 should thus consider the balance between vegetation restoration and water conservation zhao et al 2020 future revegetation in the clp should consider several aspects to improve regional sustainability feng et al 2017 jia et al 2017 zhao et al 2020 first the selection of the area for afforestation should fully consider the availability of water resources and the arid areas are not recommended liu et al 2008 ren et al 2018 wei et al 2019 second the exotic species with high water consumption should not be introduced otherwise they will consume excessive water to maintain the growth nan et al 2019 in addition it is inappropriate to increase the planting density which will result in sharp decrease in soil water and groundwater recharge but increase in evapotranspiration han et al 2020 ma et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 overall it is better to conduct revegetation matching the local climatic conditions and soil properties the appropriate vegetation pattern can be determined by the process based ecological models and one of our previous studies employed the dynamic vegetation model lpj guess to give potential natural vegetation and further suggested the vegetation pattern peng and li 2018 in future we can combine vegetation dynamics model with hydrological models to further determine the appropriate vegetation planting scheme from the perspective of regional water resources sustainability 5 conclusions despite that the streamflow under changing environment has been largely investigated the streamflow component has not been fully studied taking the loess plateau of china as example this study explored the spatial and temporal variations in baseflow at 55 hydrological stations of eight basins and further attributed the changes in baseflow the baseflow had great spatial variation and showed a significant decreasing trend in contrast the spatiotemporal variations in bfi were small precipitation and hydrogeological condition e g loess thickness were the most important for the spatial variation in baseflow the decreased baseflow was caused by increased potential evapotranspiration population and ndvi as well as decreased sub surface runoff and volumetric soil water the direct or indirect effects of the tree plantation on baseflow should be paid great attentions for regional sustainability credit authorship contribution

2537,baseflow plays an important role in sustaining the ecosystem during dry seasons or in arid regions and its spatiotemporal variations greatly influence the stability of ecosystem because of climate change and the revegetation project the streamflow has been reported to significantly decrease in past decades in china s loess plateau clp however the changes in streamflow components have not been fully investigated the objective of this study is thus to detect and attribute the changes in baseflow in the clp using data of 55 hydrological stations for 1956 1990 and 2001 2019 the geographic detector correlation analysis and elasticity coefficient methods were employed to qualitatively and quantitively analyze the influence of various factors on baseflow the baseflow accounts for 35 76 of streamflow the baseflow in 85 of hydrological stations decreased by 10 while the baseflow index bfi of 82 hydrological stations showed an upward trend precipitation and hydrogeological condition e g loess thickness were likely to dominate the spatial heterogeneity of baseflow while the potential evapotranspiration population sub surface runoff ndvi and soil water were responsible for the decrease in baseflow with contributions of 27 21 17 16 and 16 respectively the consistence or inconsistence between baseflow and bfi as well as their relations to environmental changes provide new insights into the changes in hydrological processes keywords streamflow component spatiotemporal variation regional environmental factors attribution analysis revegetation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction baseflow is the streamflow component coming from groundwater or other delayed sources which reflects the relationship between surface water and groundwater hall 1968 baseflow maintains the basic flow of rivers in periods of no precipitation and drought miller et al 2016 and thus plays a positive role in maintaining the seasonal distribution of streamflow and maintaining aquatic habitats hare et al 2021 rivett et al 2011 understanding the spatiotemporal variations in baseflow is vital for management of water resources and ecosystems due to the differences in regional conditions and human activities the baseflow has strong spatiotemporal heterogeneity on the global scale the high values of annual baseflow 5000 m3 s mostly occur in north america and south america and low annual baseflow in africa and europe in recent decades the hydrological stations with significant downward trend are 1 3 times of those with increasing trend and the downward trend is mostly detected in south america australia and asia tan et al 2020 to reveal the reasons for variability of baseflow it is essential to determine the controlling factors of baseflow baseflow is influenced by both surface and subsurface characteristics including climate soil groundwater vegetation and topography segura et al 2019 theoretically baseflow increases with increasing rainfall soil infiltration rate and groundwater recharge but decreases with increasing evapotranspiration brutsaert 2005 price 2011 vegetation may influence baseflow by changing interception and evapotranspiration bonneau et al 2018 feng et al 2016 for example vegetation interception has decreased precipitation passing rates by up to 15 over central and northwest north america central and east asia murray 2014 while the earth s greening has increased terrestrial evapotranspiration by 12 0 2 4 mm year 1 zeng et al 2018 on the other hand vegetation can increase baseflow by improving soil permeability and increasing groundwater recharge rumsey et al 2015 topographic features e g elevation slope and basin shape determine how much precipitation flows into river or remains in soils during rainfall events rumsey et al 2015 segura et al 2019 and they mainly affect the spatial variations in baseflow the above factors combine to influence the variability of baseflow and their effects should be comprehensively considered analysis of baseflow change is crucial for dry regions with substantial environmental changes the clp is the largest loess covered area with the thickest loess up to 350 m deep in the world xiong et al 2014 zhu et al 2018 the resultant huge reservoirs for soil water and groundwater have been reported to greatly influence vegetation carrying capacity and catchment scale hydrological processes huang 2019 to control the severe soil loss the grain for green project initiated from 1999 has converted large areas of farmland to forestland and grassland subsequently the sediment concentration has been reported to decrease by 21 and the runoff coefficients has decreased by 26 wang et al 2015 with subhumid to arid climates the decrease in streamflow will exacerbate water shortage and has thus been largely investigated li et al 2016b li et al 2019 however the changes in streamflow components have rarely been considered especially for baseflow therefore it is urgent to explore the changes in baseflow to provide a theoretical basis for the sustainability of water resources and vegetation taking the clp as an example study area the overall goal of this study is to detect and attribute the spatiotemporal variations in baseflow in dry regions with substantial environmental changes specifically we will ask the following questions i what changes have occurred to baseflow and related environmental factors ii which factor dominates the spatial and temporal variations of baseflow we will estimate the baseflow of 55 hydrological stations in eight basins and analyze the dominant factors by the geographical detector correlation analysis and elasticity coefficient methods fundamentally this study will fully reveal the spatiotemporal variations in baseflow and their dominant factors which will contribute to understanding of subsurface hydrological processes in a changing environment for application our study can potentially support how to balance the afforestation and water resource management in the loess plateau and similar regions in the world 2 data and methods 2 1 study area the clp is located in the middle and upper reaches of the yellow river with an area of 640 000 km2 the elevation decreases from northwest to southeast it transits from subhumid to arid climates with mean annual temperature of 3 7 14 0 and mean annual rainfall of 144 812 mm with 72 of annual precipitation falling from june to september li et al 2012 zhang et al 2020 the land use mainly includes farmland forestland and grassland accounting for 32 15 and 42 of the total area li et al 2016a the vegetation coverage decreases from southeast to northwest the revegetation project greatly improved vegetation coverage and the increasing rates of ndvi in 2000 2015 were 10 times of those in 1982 1999 mainly because of human activities li et al 2017 the hydrogeological conditions are very similar across the whole study areas most of the area is covered by the quaternary loess which contains three layers the top layer is the malan loess formed in the upper pleistocen 10 30 m thick the intermediate layer is the lishi loess formed in the middle pleistocene 100 150 m thick serving as the aquifer for the relatively high porosity the bottom layer is the wucheng loess formed in the lower pleistocene 22 78 m thick serving as aquitard due to the low permeability however the thickness of loess varies spatially from 0 to 350 m thick which may influence groundwater storage xiong et al 2014 zhu et al 2018 the porosity of loess is generally up to 45 50 and the large pores are prominent the water table depth fluctuates between 30 and 100 m below the soil surface with complicated natural conditions and anthropogenic impacts the hydrological processes have been changing significantly in recent decades and the downward trend has been reported for most hydrological variables gao et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 zhao et al 2017 considering the above conditions eight basins with significant changes in streamflow and environmental factors will be selected for this study fig 1 the basins have areas ranging from 3 253 to 105 350 km2 accounting for 53 of the loess covered area these basins span strong climatic and topographic gradients longitudinally from north to south of the clp table 1 shows the details of the eight catchments and the variation in hydrometeorological variables 2 2 data collection we selected streamflow data from 55 hydrological stations located at the outlet of the whole basin key cross sections of the river and outlet of important tributaries they cover different reaches of the same river and variable natural conditions of different rivers fig 1 as such the selected stations can fully reflect the hydrological conditions of the eight basins and the loess plateau the reliability and consistency of the data have been strictly controlled by ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china due to data availability we can only obtain daily data series for 1956 1990 and 2001 2019 however in general every 8 12 years of runoff process contain a complete abundance and depletion of hydrological years and the error caused by periodic interannual variation of runoff can be ignored on the time scale of at least 10 years in the clp dai et al 2016 geng et al 2021 shao et al 2021 yoo 2006 the data length of the two periods is at least 14 years and the current two periods well represent hydrological conditions before and after the revegetation project initiated in 1999 as such the inter period changes in streamflow can be linked with environmental changes because of human activities the generation of baseflow includes several processes in the atmosphere vadose zones and saturated zones specifically the precipitation from the atmosphere provides the source water and then it infiltrates through the vadose zones to the saturated zones and finally discharges into the river in the form of baseflow in consequence precipitation soil water and groundwater are hydrological variables directly influencing inputs but evapotranspiration is the main output a lot of factors may directly or indirectly influence the above hydrological variables for example from the atmosphere to the underground it may include climate vegetation topography soil and geology however on catchment scale and for a short period the soil topography and geology would change little we thus directly select the above hydrological variables and environmental factors including climate and vegetation specifically they include precipitation potential evapotranspiration ndvi volumetric soil water and sub surface runoff in addition human activities may have great impacts on groundwater it is better to give the exact number of groundwater withdraw and return of irrigation however on one hand there is no such data or these data are hard to be obtained on the other hand they can be indirectly by the population we thus used population as an index of human activities to analyze anthropogenic impacts on baseflow daily meteorological data of 60 meteorological stations were collected from china meteorology administration https data cma cn the spatially averaged meteorological data of each sub basin were generated by the kriging interpolation in addition to attribute the changes in baseflow we collected potential evapotranspiration et0 from terraclimate dataset with a spatial resolution of 0 05 0 05 https www climatologylab org terraclimate html abatzoglou et al 2018 ndvi products from noaa avhrr with a spatial resolution of 0 05 0 05 sub surface runoff ssr the runoff generated by precipitation infiltration flowing from groundwater recharge

post and jakeman 1996 the cumulative areas of tree replantation in 1959 1969 1979 1989 1999 and 2006 were collected from liang et al 2015 and gao et al 2016 2 3 baseflow separation methods as baseflow cannot be directly measured it is mostly separated from the observed streamflow by some methods to obtain the best estimates of baseflow this study compared eight methods including two bfi baseflow index standard and modified methods three hysep hydrograph separation program fixed interval sliding interval and local minimum methods part two digital filters lyne hollick one parameter filter and eckhardt two parameter filter details about baseflow separation methods can be found in the original papers eckhardt 2005 hydrology 1980 lyne and hollick 1979 nathan and mcmahon 1990 sloto and crouse 1996 rutledge 1998 wahl and wahl 1988 and they were briefly summarized as follows bfi divides the daily streamflow series into many equal intervals identifies the turning point in each interval and connects the turning points to obtain the baseflow hydrograph hydrology 1980 the turning point in bfi standard or bfi modified is determined by multiplying the lowest streamflow value in an interval by the turning point test factor or daily recession index respectively hydrology 1980 wahl and wahl 1988 hysep calculates surface runoff duration based on an empirical relation and then uses twice the number of days after which surface runoff ceases as the interval to estimate baseflow the baseflow is further separated by three methods hysep fixed hysep slide hysep locmin sloto and crouse 1996 part separate the baseflow based on antecedent streamflow recession rutledge 1998 if daily streamflow values decrease for n or more days and the streamflow never decreases by 0 1 log cycle as the baseflow other daily baseflow is determined by linear interpolation lyne hollick and eckhardt were used for one parameter digital filter method and two parameter digital filter method respectively eckhardt 2005 lyne and hollick 1979 nathan and mcmahon 1990 the filtering techniques filter the high frequency signals in the streamflow record associated with surface runoff from the low frequency signals associated with groundwater discharge as baseflow compared with lyne hollick eckhardt limits the maximum ratio of baseflow to streamflow as baseflow is a relatively stable component of streamflow yao et al 2021 the stability or reliability of separated baseflow is usually used as standard to select the best baseflow separation method in this study annual bfi was used to determine the stability we thus calculated the standard deviation and extreme value ratio of bfi series for t1 and t2 at 55 stations extreme value ratio is ratio of maximum minus minimum to minimum in addition strict baseflow points were selected as the measured baseflow in daily streamflow series and compared with baseflow obtained by eight baseflow separation methods the reliability of different baseflow separation methods were evaluated by calculating nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and kling gupta efficiency kge respectively details of this method can be found in xie et al 2020 2 4 interpreting spatial variation in baseflow the geographical detector is a tool to detect and utilize spatial diversity and includes four detectors wang et al 2010 the factor detector was employed to explore the factors dominating the spatial variations in baseflow specifically the factor detection is a quantitative technique that determines whether the spatial distribution of a dependent variable is similar to that of an independent variable the similarity is represented by the value of q with a range of 0 1 and the explanatory power of the independent variable to dependent variable is stronger when q is closer to 1 1 q 1 h 1 l n h œÉ h 2 n œÉ 2 where h 1 l is the stratification of variable h and n are the number of units in stratification h and the entire area respectively œÉ h 2 and œÉ 2 are the variances of dependent variable of stratification h and entire area respectively in this study the values of baseflow and bfi were used as dependent variable whereas p ssr vsw ndvi ti et0 bs served as independent variables to explore the factors dominating the variations in baseflow 2 5 attributing baseflow change the elasticity coefficient method was used to quantify the contribution of each factor to baseflow change the total change in baseflow Œ¥b tot is the difference of mean baseflow between two time periods 2 Œ¥ b tot b t 2 b t 1 the total change in baseflow can be partitioned into components representing contributions of different factors 3 Œ¥ b tot Œ¥ b 1 Œ¥ b 2 Œ¥ b 3 where Œ¥ b 1 Œ¥ b 2 Œ¥ b 3 are the changes of baseflow caused by different controlling factors according to the principle of elasticity coefficient method Œ¥ b i can be expressed as 4 Œ¥ b i Œµ i Œ¥ x i x i b where x i is the mean annual value of the i th controlling factor Œµi is the elasticity coefficient of x i in this study the least square estimation was used to estimate the elasticity of annual baseflow to environmental factors zheng et al 2009 5 Œµ i b b x i x i œÅ b x i c b c x i where œÅ b x i is the correlation coefficient between baseflow and environmental factors c x i and c b are the coefficients of variation of environmental factors and baseflow respectively the contribution p i of the i th factor to the change of baseflow can be calculated as follows 6 p i Œ¥ b i 1 n Œ¥ b i 100 where n is the number of factors 3 results 3 1 selected baseflow separation method the results of the standard deviation fig 2 a 2b and extreme value ratio fig 2c 2d of the bfi series for t1 and t2 showed that the median mean and quantile of standard deviation extreme value ratio of bfi sequence from the eckhardt method were the lowest as such the eckhardt method presented the most stable baseflow in the clp further the calculated nsh fig 2e and kge fig 2f showed that for eight baseflow separation methods the eckhardt method had the largest nse mean 0 93 and median 0 97 and its kge mean 0 84 and median 0 87 were only second to part therefore the eckhardt method had the best performance in identifying baseflow overall the eckhardt method had the best stability and reliability for baseflow separation in the clp in the following sections the baseflow time series from the eckhardt method will be employed for further analysis 3 2 spatial and temporal variability of baseflow the mean annual baseflow ranged from 18 fen river to 75 mm tuwei river with an average of 31 20 mm while the mean annual bfi ranged from 0 54 yan river to 0 73 tuwei river with an average of 0 64 0 06 from t1 to t2 the mean annual baseflow and bfi changed by 36 13 and 7 9 respectively the changes in baseflow were more variable than those in bfi spatially the basins in the south and the north had higher baseflow than those in the middle fig 3 a for example the mean annual baseflow in the tuwei river north and the wei river south were respectively 75 and 43 mm but the values in the yan and fen river middle were about 18 mm over all the sub basins the baseflow of 71 of hydrological stations were 40 mm the bfi varied great in space fig 3b and the bfi of 78 of hydrological stations ranged between 0 5 and 0 7 within each basin from upper to lower reaches the baseflow in the north varied less but the baseflow in the south varied drastically and the spatial variability in baseflow and bfi was similar fig 3c temporally the mean annual baseflow overall decreased significantly by 19 57 from t1 to t2 fig 4 a b but the decrease varied with rivers the fen and kuye river had the largest decrease of 57 and 52 while the yan and wuding river had the smallest decrease of 20 respectively over all the sub basins the baseflow in 69 of hydrological stations decreased by 20 fig 4c but the trend of bfi was opposite to that of baseflow since 82 of stations showed an upward trend fig 4d 3 3 spatiotemporal variability in environmental factors the spatial distribution of each environmental factor was shown in fig 5 p ndvi vsw and ssr increased from northwest to southeast but other factors had complicated variability specifically ti was high in the north but low in the south et0 was the highest in the fen river and the lowest in the wei river bs existed little spatial variability the thickness of loess decreased from central to southeast and northwest temporally the mann kendell test showed that p in 96 of the sub basins has insignificant trend fig 5a et0 and ndvi showed significant upward trend in all basins fig 5b c but ssr and vsw had decreased significantly in 87 and 80 of sub basins respectively fig 5d e the percentage change of ssr was the largest 45 22 followed by ndvi 24 13 the percentage changes of other factors were all within 20 3 4 dominance of environmental factors on baseflow the results of factor detector showed that p was the most important factor controlling the spatial variation of baseflow with q value of 0 89 followed by ssr 0 84 vsw 0 82 and ndvi 0 70 each factor passed the significance test p 0 05 in addition the spatial distribution of baseflow and loess thickness data is not available was similar which was high in the central and low in the north and south fig 3a fig 5h therefore the loess thickness may have an important influence on the spatial distribution of baseflow but for the spatial variability of bfi all factors failed to pass the significance test implying that the spatial variability in bfi was more complicated than baseflow the pearson correlation analysis was used to connect the time series of baseflow with environmental factors e g p et0 ndvi ssr and vsw in most sub basins baseflow was positively correlated with p ssr and vsw but negatively related to et0 and ndvi fig 6 the abovementioned relationships were significant at 35 hydrological stations except for ndvi at 14 stations however the controlling factors of bfi appeared different from baseflow bfi was negatively correlated with p and vsw but positively correlated with et0 ndvi and ssr however these relationships were insignificant at most hydrological stations the number of stations with significant bfi ndvi relationship was the largest 23 followed by bfi et0 17 and bfi p 15 3 5 contribution of environmental factors to baseflow reduction the elasticity coefficients of baseflow to environmental factors in eight basins were shown in fig 7 the multi basin mean Œµ p ranging from 0 02 to 2 17 Œµ et 0 1 83 to 5 49 Œµ ndvi 0 21 to 2 50 Œµ ssr 0 07 to 0 79 Œµ vsw 0 54 to 5 30 and Œµ populatin 0 19 to 2 79 were 1 12 4 06 1 15 0 39 3 49 and 1 29 respectively these results suggest that a 1 increase in p et0 ndvi ssr vsw and population would cause the baseflow to change 1 12 4 06 1 15 0 39 3 49 and 1 29 respectively accordingly the baseflow was most sensitive to et0 averaged over the eight basins the elasticity coefficient method showed that the contributions to baseflow change were the largest for et0 27 and population 21 intermediate for ssr 17 ndvi 16 and vsw 16 and the smallest for p 2 however the factors dominating baseflow reduction varied with basins fig 7 specifically et0 had the greatest contributions in the kuye wuding yan and fen river population in the tuwei and jing river vsw in the beiluo and ssr in the wei river had the largest contributions respectively 4 discussion 4 1 rationality of selection of baseflow separation method our evaluation of reliability of baseflow separation results showed that the eckhardt method performed the best many studies have considered the stability of baseflow as an indicator for method selection beck et al 2013 eckhardt 2008 eckhardt 2012 lott and stewart 2016 to further evaluate the reliability of baseflow separation methods the estimated and simulated dry season low flows have been compared longobardi and villani 2008 smakhtin 2001 tan et al 2020 or the minimum daily streamflow values are usually selected as measured baseflow furey and gupta 2001 novita and wahyuningsih 2016 however the former procedure tends to underestimate baseflow while the latter cannot be widely used it is more reasonable to select strict baseflow points with uniform distribution in dry and wet periods as measured baseflow based on daily streamflow data xie et al 2020 this study used this method to combine the stability of baseflow to identify the best baseflow separation method the framework can provide suggestions for the selection of baseflow separation methods in the clp and other regions 4 2 why does baseflow vary spatiotemporally spatially the mean annual baseflow in the southern and northern basins were larger than the middle fig 3a all the environmental factors considered in this study had significant effects on the spatial divergence of baseflow p 0 05 but precipitation was likely to be the dominant factor precipitation is the water input for baseflow formation and the higher the intensity and frequency of rainfall the larger the baseflow cartwright and morgenstern 2015 koskelo et al 2012 wittenberg et al 2019 the clp is a water limited region with an annual average precipitation of 382 mm year 1 huang et al 2008 and the spatial pattern of hydrological components e g runoff soil water and groundwater recharge is thus dominated by that of precipitation hu et al 2019 huang 2019 lal 2004 zhao et al 2017 as the rainfall is mainly controlled by the east asian summer monsoon the spatial pattern of precipitation and hydrological components are thus overall decreasing from southeast to northwest hu et al 2019 wang et al 2019 yan et al 2018 however the spatial pattern of baseflow may be perturbed by the loess thickness specifically the loess is the thickest in the middle and decreases to the south and north the regions with thick loess can store more water in the aquifers and the precipitation would discharge into streamflow more slowly through the subsurface hydrological processes it implied that precipitation and hydrogeological condition e g loess thickness overall determine the spatial pattern of baseflow temporally the changes in et0 population ssr ndvi and vsw caused a significant reduction in baseflow and contributed 27 21 17 16 and 16 to the reduction respectively fig 7 precipitation overall dominates baseflow formation but the precipitation has not changed significantly over the past decades fig 5a a such the precipitation may have little impacts on the temporal changes in baseflow feng et al 2016 su and shangguan 2019 the increasing evapotranspiration population and ndvi as well as the decreasing ssr and vsw greatly contributed to the decreased baseflow in the clp fig 7 the negative correlation between evapotranspiration and baseflow and the positive correlation between groundwater soil water and baseflow have been confirmed in many regions of the world ficklin et al 2016 mukherjee et al 2018 niswonger and fogg 2008 tashie et al 2020 in the clp the evapotranspiration significantly increased and ssr vsw significantly decreased fig 5 it is thus reasonable to conclude the impacts of evapotranspiration and ssr and vsw on baseflow change along with the rapid rise in population the rapid increase in regional water demand has led to more serious baseflow reduction camacho et al 2022 smith et al 2018 wang and cai 2009 in addition a large number of ecological restoration projects have been carried out in the eight basins from 1959 to 2006 the average area of check dams in the eight basins increased from 2 to 111 km2 and terraces from 37 to 2947 km2 gao et al 2016 liang et al 2015 terraces and check dams intercepted and stored precipitation and streamflow increased soil infiltration and soil water storage which can slow down the baseflow reduction to some extent han et al 2019 wei et al 2019 zhang et al 2008 therefore in addition to large scale vegetation reconstruction human activities have a great impact on baseflow because of data availability we do not have data for the period of 1991 2000 which is a period of rapid growth of groundwater withdrawal especially in the inner mongolia but only about 6 of the study area is located in inner mongolia in particular the shanxi and shaanxi experienced a rapid growth in groundwater withdrawal from the 1980 s and gansu for 1970 2000 ma et al 2022 shaanxi institute of geo environment monitoring 2016 shen et al 2022 our data periods have overlap with the abovementioned periods for groundwater withdrawal in addition groundwater withdrawal can be indirectly reflected by population and we employed population as an impact factor the relationship between increased vegetation and decreased baseflow is more complex and will be discussed in the following section 4 3 effects of vegetation on baseflow variability land use change can profoundly affect hydrological cycle and different land use types may exert different impacts on baseflow aboelnour et al 2021 ahiablame et al 2017 the grain for green project initiated in 1999 has greatly increased forestland but decreased agricultural land and grassland chen et al 2015 fu et al 2011 liu et al 2008 in particular the preferred plants for revegetation are often fast growing and deep rooted species gao et al 2020 li et al 2021 as shown in fig 8 a the tree plantation rates after 1999 were 4 times of the past the increase of vegetation and its feedback led to the depletion of baseflow in areas with limited water resources tan et al 2020 trancoso et al 2017 the baseflow of the clp continued to decrease and baseflow of typical basins decreased with the increase of vegetation until it reached a steady state when the vegetation coverage reaches 60 70 wu et al 2019 zhang et al 2022 the baseflow gradually decreases with the increase of forestland in these water limited regions the water resources can hardly sustain the planted trees to survive these trees have to pump water from soils subsequently the increased evapotranspiration induced dry soils can decrease water infiltration and groundwater recharge to greatly perturb the subsurface hydrological processes cao et al 2011 feng et al 2017 liu et al 2008 the changes in et0 ssr and vsw confirmed the significant impacts of vegetation on hydrological cycle and baseflow we further employed ndvi to examine the impacts of vegetation on baseflow the relationship between ndvi and hydrological factors in the clp showed that increasing ndvi leads to increasing et0 and decreasing vsw and ssr fig 8b the positive ndvi et0 relationship was significant in most basins except for the wuding river and significant negative ndvi ssr and ndvi vsw relationships existed in more than half of the basins therefore the revegetation may have great impacts on the baseflow reduction 4 4 implications to sustainable water resources management baseflow is an important component of streamflow hodgkins and dudley 2011 miller et al 2016 it accounts for 35 76 of the streamflow in the clp fig 3b and have played an important role in maintaining river morphology and ecological functions cheng and li 2021 cheng et al 2019 however 85 of hydrological stations had a baseflow reduction of 10 fig 4c in this study we found that the increased ndvi and et0 as well as decreased ssr were responsible for the baseflow reduction fig 6 fig 7 however et0 and ssr were significantly correlated with ndvi in most basins fig 8b the above results highlight that the direct or indirect role of vegetation change in baseflow reduction should not be underestimated as mentioned in previous studies the revegetation is approaching the limits of sustainable water resources in the clp bryan et al 2018 feng et al 2016 ma et al 2019 wu et al 2020 should thus consider the balance between vegetation restoration and water conservation zhao et al 2020 future revegetation in the clp should consider several aspects to improve regional sustainability feng et al 2017 jia et al 2017 zhao et al 2020 first the selection of the area for afforestation should fully consider the availability of water resources and the arid areas are not recommended liu et al 2008 ren et al 2018 wei et al 2019 second the exotic species with high water consumption should not be introduced otherwise they will consume excessive water to maintain the growth nan et al 2019 in addition it is inappropriate to increase the planting density which will result in sharp decrease in soil water and groundwater recharge but increase in evapotranspiration han et al 2020 ma et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 overall it is better to conduct revegetation matching the local climatic conditions and soil properties the appropriate vegetation pattern can be determined by the process based ecological models and one of our previous studies employed the dynamic vegetation model lpj guess to give potential natural vegetation and further suggested the vegetation pattern peng and li 2018 in future we can combine vegetation dynamics model with hydrological models to further determine the appropriate vegetation planting scheme from the perspective of regional water resources sustainability 5 conclusions despite that the streamflow under changing environment has been largely investigated the streamflow component has not been fully studied taking the loess plateau of china as example this study explored the spatial and temporal variations in baseflow at 55 hydrological stations of eight basins and further attributed the changes in baseflow the baseflow had great spatial variation and showed a significant decreasing trend in contrast the spatiotemporal variations in bfi were small precipitation and hydrogeological condition e g loess thickness were the most important for the spatial variation in baseflow the decreased baseflow was caused by increased potential evapotranspiration population and ndvi as well as decreased sub surface runoff and volumetric soil water the direct or indirect effects of the tree plantation on baseflow should be paid great attentions for regional sustainability credit authorship contribution

2538,digital surface models dsms are crucial in providing accurate urban flood hazard maps the ubiquitous availability of lidar data where accessible makes constructing geometrically sound dsms feasible however little attention has been paid to developing approaches for producing geometrically consistent dsms herein is described an application driven procedure for creating a geometrically robust dsm dsm1 two further dsms were created one for portraying streets using breaklines as ancillary information dsm2 and the other through direct interpolation of lidar data dsm3 the geometrical correctness and vertical accuracy of these dsms were examined qualitatively and quantitatively by plotting longitudinal profiles and cross sections onto major runoff pathways and determining statistical error the effect of these dsms geometric consistency on flood hazard maps was also evaluated for this hydraulic outputs from dsm1 were used as a benchmark to compare hydraulic outputs from dsm2 and dsm3 this comparison was conducted at two spatial resolutions i at the total area flooded using the f statistic and ii at the pixel level by employing global indices and category level indices extracted from a confusion matrix our findings revealed that 1 dsm1 defined the most geometrically coherent configurations for runoff pathways 2 in urban areas with the most densely packed streets and buildings dsm2 and particularly dsm3 featured the most unrealistic geometric representations of the urban domain displaying fake water flow barriers and lower than real runoff pathway cross sections and 3 the geometric quality of the dsms created had a significant impact on flood hazard maps reliability i e the disagreement in flood hazard categories between dsm2 and dsm3 and dsm1 varied from 28 to 82 these findings can be very valuable in achieving further reductions and better flood risk management keywords urban areas digital surface model lidar dataset hydraulic modelling

5281 zenodo 5171778 1 introduction between 2000 and 2019 7348 natural hazard related disasters caused 1 23 million deaths and usd 2 97 trillion in economic losses affecting more than 4 billion people worldwide undrr 2020 during this period climate related disasters increased with floods accounting for 44 of all disasters wmo 2021 flood risk on the other hand is expected to rise in the coming decades owing to climate change induced increases in the frequency and magnitude of floods along with the projected global growth of the exposed population and assets kundzewicz et al 2014 accordingly flood risk mitigation is deemed to be one of the key societal challenges to be addressed during this century o donnell and thorne 2020 coping with this challenge requires good urban flood risk management and in depth knowledge of flood hazard along river basins and coastal areas tsakiris 2014 pasquier et al 2019 such an appraisal is determined by the type of flooding e g fluvial flash floods or pluvial and the probability or return period of the flood event to be assessed as an example the eu floods directive considers the following scenarios i low probability or extreme events 500 year flood ii medium probability 100 year flood and iii high probability where appropriate 10 year flood further flood magnitude is considered prinos et al 2008 mudashiru et al 2021 in the context outlined above flood hazard maps are essential for reporting vulnerabilities and risks masood and takeuchi 2012 this mapping also facilitates the implementation of successful risk management strategies based on preventive and preparedness actions to avoid minimize transfer share or accept flood hazards di baldassarre et al 2009 surminski and thieken 2017 flood hazard assessment is a complex process that requires determining its magnitude ideally this encompasses the specification of flood depth flood wave velocity its duration and sediment and debris loading scawthorn et al 2006 in practice the above analysis is simplified by considering flood extent water depth or eventually a combination of the two parameters above and flow velocity van alphen et al 2009 in urban areas hazard assessment and cartographic depiction rely on two dimensional 2d hydrodynamic models since in this environment it is not feasible to assume a one dimensional 1d flow vojinovic and tutulic 2009 upstream boundary conditions of 2d hydrodynamic models are generally provided by flow quantiles established through hydrological modelling or flood frequency analysis depending on the available data other mandatory inputs are land cover to estimate roughness and topography portrayed as digital surface models dsms which capture both natural and built artificial urban environment features bodoque et al 2016 dsm topographic data affects 2d hydrodynamic modelling because it influences the urban geometric layout of structured or non structured meshes utilized for numerical computations yalcin 2020 the availability of lidar data since the end of the last century offers a fast and cost effective way to get detailed dsms of urban areas priestnall et al 2000 lidar data by virtue of the very high density of recorded points allows modelling and flood mapping with a horizontal spatial resolution of 1 to 2 m and a z precision of a few decimetres costabile et al 2015 however producing dsms from lidar data for flood hazard modelling and mapping is not straightforward this is because lidar data alone cannot sufficiently capture topographic breaks especially in complicated geometric configurations such as urban areas turner et al 2013 to make the above possible lidar data must be coupled with 3d breaklines that complement mass points reinforcing topographic breakdowns inside triangulated irregular networks tins liu 2008 the best way to identify breaklines is to employ local knowledge orthophotos and cadastral maps as data sources and gis tools to handle this information systematically bodoque et al 2016 disaggregating lidar data into ground terrain and non ground man made structures is another important stage in creating urban dsms this stage is challenging since the algorithms used to classify lidar data are not totally reliable consequently elements such as cars canopies or flowerpots are occasionally misclassified as ground causing dsms to block water flow noh et al 2018 few studies have focused on the need for geometrically correct dsms to generate reliable flood hazard maps that may subsequently be employed in urban flood risk management to the best of our knowledge there are hardly any studies on how to develop geometrically sound urban dsms that display preferential drainage pathways and urban features that obstruct water flow i e buildings and walls in this regard the papers by meesuk et al 2015 and noh et al 2018 serve as examples in addition there does not seem to be any research examining the effects of using dsms that are not geometrically robust on the hydraulic performance of flooded areas in terms of water depth and flow velocity which commonly dictate the layout of flood hazard maps to fill this knowledge gap this study aims to evaluate how the geometric consistency of dsms obtained from lidar data impacts on flood hazard outcomes resulting from 2d hydrodynamic modelling to begin a procedure for obtaining geometrically sound urban dsms was devised the resulting dsm henceforth denoted as dsm1 was compared to two other dsms henceforth designated as dsm2 and dsm3 built under different assumptions this was done to determine the differences in geometric configuration and flood hazard outcomes deployed by each dsm to test geometric soundness longitudinal profiles and cross sections were created for the preferential drainage pathways during flooding i e understood here as the streets buildings system vertical accuracy was also measured this was done by computing discrepancies between dsm pixel values and 2 088 points taken using differential global positioning system dgps with a vertical accuracy lower than the lidar data used here in addition it was assessed how the geometric imprecision of dsms influences the mapping of flood hazard for this purpose hydraulic outputs from dsm1 were utilized as a benchmark to compare with dsm2 and dsm3 outputs this comparison was conducted by calculating the f statistic cook and merwade 2009 and global and category level indices through a confusion matrix congalton 1991 congalton and green 1999 2 study site and data employed navaluenga is located in central spain on the banks of the alberche river between the sierra del valle gredos s eastern mountain range and the sierra de la paramera 40 24 30 n 4 42 17 w 761 m a s l fig 1 navaluenga has 2135 inhabitants data for 2021 however this figure can rise to 20 000 during the summer 4 311 dwellings are estimated with 3392 being second homes the alberche river flows 70 km from 1 800 m a s l to navaluenga this river drains 717 km2 up to this village with a time of concentration tc of 8 5 h its hydrological regime is hardly affected by human intervention as there is no important hydraulic infrastructure e g reservoirs upstream of navaluenga that regulates river water levels or the variability of river flows within navaluenga and its surroundings several torrents flow into the alberche river among these the chorrer√≥n stream tc 3 h stands out it is an ephemeral stream completely channelled in its urban reach which crosses navaluenga perpendicularly from north to south fig 1 since at least the late middle ages navaluenga has been flooded by the alberche river and the chorrer√≥n stream the 1990 s and 2000 s witnessed the most recent floods which caused economic losses and endangered locals d√≠ez herrero 2001 the dsms used here were built from the lidar data provided by the national geographic institute of spain ign raw lidar data were collected by airborne lidar systems with a density of 0 5 points m 2 and an altimetric precision z of 15 cm the reference system for this topographic dataset is the etrs89 utm zone 30 n compatible with wgs 84 using 2 088 differential gps measurements provided by the spanish general directorate of cadastre sec the elevation accuracy of the dsms was tested the study area was divided into 4 zones fig 1 i the total area of the study site which includes the urban and peri urban areas of navaluenga zone 1 ii the whole urban and peri urban floodable zone zone 2 iii the streets included within the urban floodable zone zone 3 and iv the floodable urban area with a higher density of streets and buildings zone 4 geometric consistency and elevation accuracy of dsms were investigated in zones 1 2 3 and 4 in zones 2 3 and 4 the results of hydraulic and flood hazards from each dsm were examined and compared 3 methodology the methodological approach deployed here was divided into four stages fig 2 1 developing geometrically reliable dsms for urban areas this section provides a detailed description of the procedure designed to obtain a geometrically reliable dsm dsm1 as well as the way in which the dsms dsm2 and dsm3 to be compared with dsm1 were obtained 2 evaluation of the suitability of dsms as topographic input to hydraulic models the qualitative tools used to evaluate the geometric correctness of the dsms were detailed as was the statistical approach adopted to evaluate their vertical accuracy 3 2d hydraulic modelling and flood hazard analysis it explains how the 2d hydrodynamic model was designed and implemented and the approach employed to obtain flood hazard maps and 4 comparison of flood hazard maps the quantitative indicators used to compare the flood hazard maps displayed by each dsm both at the level of the total flooded area and the flood hazard category displayed in each pixel are described 3 1 obtaining geometrically reliable dsms for urban areas when river floods affect urban areas streets are the main runoff pathways accordingly lidar point cloud processing was mainly focused on these areas the first task was to filter lidar data to select those points that were automatically classified by the ign as ground points in complex urban settings outdoor furniture e g flowerpots awnings and other elements such as vehicles can be mistakenly categorized as ground points which generate false barriers to the water flow once dsm is generated to remove these fake elements two filters were sequentially applied i points with height differences of more than 0 30 m above the average were deleted ii points with slope differences of more than 10 compared to the average were also omitted both filters were applied taking different buffers into account specifically 2 m were estimated for the filter based on the difference in height and between 1 and 5 m for the filter depending on slope for portraying streets buildings were deemed to represent their outside limits therefore the sec provided block layer was converted to points the natural neighbour s interpolation approach was then used to get elevation from the lidar ground data for the points on the border of the block layer as a frame for the street representation the ign provided centre axis of each street was employed every 2 m parallel lines to these central axes were drawn and converted into points similarly to what was done with the block layer the lidar ground data was used to assign elevation values to these points to appropriately depict dwellings buildings designated lidar data points were retrieved these points were then clipped using the sec provided building layer as a proxy for roof height the maximum point elevation per building was then extracted the collected points were linked to the 3d points of the buildings allowing for their accurate geometrical depiction regarding the alberche river riverbanks were manually digitalized using the available orthophoto as a reference bathymetry was also collected through a field survey to this end a differential gps trimble 5700 was used to obtain an average density of 0 3 points m 2 regarding the chorrer√≥n stream streambanks were manually digitalized additionally a couple of lines were drawn in parallel to the streambanks matching the streambed lidar points were used to assign surface elevation using the natural neighbour s interpolation method once all topographic data were filtered and processed a tin was created so lidar and bathymetry points were included as mass points whereas line features e g riverbanks street boundaries were added as breaklines hard lines to enforce slope breaks in the tin arrighi and campo 2019 at this phase manual adjustments were also made to the tin to integrate fieldwork identified structures e g walls levees embankments not detected by the original lidar data errors detected in the tin were also fixed last a dsm was created dsm1 by linearly interpolating the tin and using a 2 metre cell size to match the point density of the original lidar data additionally two other dsms were produced in the first dsm 2 streets were portrayed by assigning breaklines using the average las z value to produce 3d features the second dsm3 was obtained by direct interpolation of lidar data this was done to determine how different the geometry exhibited by dsm2 and dsm3 is from that of dsm1 as well as to quantitatively define how the differences in the geometric arrangement of the dsms affect the flood hazard maps that each dsm deploys dsm1 dsm2 and dsm3 have been made freely available

of dsms as topographic input to 2d hydrodynamic modelling was tested using both qualitative and quantitative criteria with the latter based on statistical sampling error approaches focused on vertical accuracy in the first approach the geometric consistency of streets and channelling along the urban reach of the chorrer√≥n stream was visually checked for each dsm in a second phase the conclusions of the previous analysis were corroborated by the layout of longitudinal profiles and cross sections of the streets buildings system and the chorrer√≥n stream a differential global positioning system dgps dataset covering navaluenga and the area around it zone 1 was used to test the vertical accuracy of dsms 2 088 points with vertical and horizontal accuracies 0 15 m were used to evaluate dsm vertical accuracy for the other zones all included within zone 1 the point samples were 546 zone 2 209 zone 3 and 55 zone 4 vertical accuracy was then evaluated by computing the difference between the pixel values of the dsms and the corresponding dgps measurements the statistical distribution of errors throughout the four zones was captured by plotting histograms normalized by their respective means so the standard deviation could be visually contrasted the error sample was further described using metrics of centrality mean and median dispersion standard deviation and range and measures of shape kurtosis and skewness vertical accuracy was determined using the root mean square error rmse and the mean absolute error mae the coefficient of determination r2 was also used to assess the dsms goodness of fit to the sample of dgps z values 3 3 2d hydraulic modelling and flood hazard analysis hydraulic modelling was performed using the iber two dimensional hydrodynamic model blad√© et al 2014 the computational mesh was generated employing the rtin regular triangular irregular network method with maximum and minimum triangle lengths of 2 m and 1 m respectively once produced the node height of the mesh elements was adjusted from the dsms to do so a threshold tolerance of 0 1 m was set which is consistent with the altimetric accuracy of the lidar data used 0 15 m upstream boundary conditions for the alberche river and the chorrer√≥n stream assumed steady state subcritical flow conditions for the 500 and 25 year floods bodoque et al 2016 bodoque et al 2020 d√≠ez herrero 2001 as a downstream boundary condition it used a subcritical regime the discharges used were 2006 m3 s 1 500 year flood and 856 m3 s 1 25 year flood for the alberche river and 167 m3 s 1 500 year flood and 10 m3 s 1 25 year flood for the chorrer√≥n stream the roughness coefficient was estimated from national land cover mapping at a scale of 1 25 000 and then allocated in accordance with chow 1959 the equivalent value of manning s n to each land use land cover unit culverts and weirs operating in the study area fig 3 were geometrically characterized and included as internal conditions in the 2d hydrodynamic model the culverts start and end locations as well as their dimensions width and height for rectangular culverts and diameter for circular culverts were examined all culverts were given a manning s n value of 0 018 a weir with a discharge coefficient of 1 7 was deemed indicative of the alberche river s urban reach also included in the computational mesh were the two bridges present in the reach fig 3 their geometry was replicated by subdividing the mesh first the coordinates of the upper chords upstream ends and deck width were established the relative coordinates and top and bottom elevations of the decks as well as the relative location and width crosswise to the flow direction of the bridge piers were to be determined next furthermore the model was only affected by the bridge piles and abutments if the water level did not reach the bridge deck when the deck height was exceeded the coefficients for free or submerged pressure flow as well as the weir coefficients with values of 0 6 0 8 and 1 7 were added before launching the simulation a second order numerical approach was considered cea and blad√© 2015 a courant friedrichs lewy number of 0 45 was employed to achieve a stable numerical scheme the wet dry limit which is the depth in metres below which an element is considered dry and is therefore left out of the hydrodynamic computation was set at 0 01 m a flood hazard analysis was given by the product of water depth and velocity rasters derived from the 2d hydrodynamic modelling d√≠ez herrero et al 2009 in this research the following flood hazard categories were considered i high flood hazard hfh ii medium flood hazard mfh iii low flood hazard lfh and iv non flooded areas nfa 3 4 comparison of flood hazard maps the objective of this evaluation was to compare dsm1 reference model flood hazard maps with those from dsm2 and dsm3 the following scenarios were examined for this purpose i scenario1 500 year flood generated by the alberche river and the chorrer√≥n stream ii scenario 2 25 year flood induced by the alberche river and the chorrer√≥n stream iii scenario 3 500 year flood triggered by the chorrer√≥n stream and iv scenario 4 25 year flood driven by the chorrer√≥n stream comparative analyses were conducted in zones 2 3 and 4 see their description at the end of section 2 two approaches were used to address the above comparison first using the f statistic cook and merwade 2009 the difference between the flooding areas of dsm1 and dsm2 and dsm3 was assessed this statistic was determined by the equation 1 f 100 aop ao a p a o p where ao is the reference inundation area derived from dsm1 ap provides the area flooded by dsm2 and dsm3 and aop is the overlapping flooding area for dsm1 dsm2 and dsm3 a score of 100 represents perfect agreement between dsm1 dsm2 and dsm3 flooding areas whereas the lower the f the greater the disagreement between dsm1 with dsm2 and dsm3 flooding areas then using pixel level statistics the agreement between the flood hazard categories from dsm1 and those from dsm2 and dsm3 was checked a confusion matrix was devised for this purpose congalton 1991 congalton and green 1999 it included values showing the degree of similarity between paired observations provided by the set of flood hazard categories derived from dsm1 or the reference dataset rd moreover the set of dsm2 and dsm3 flood hazard categories which were designated as the dataset under control duc were considered a confusion matrix is a mxm rows columns matrix where m represents the flood hazard categories under consideration rh reference hazard refers to rd classes whereas eh relates to duc classes estimated hazard the diagonal cells of the confusion matrix include values that correspond to well defined flood hazard categories from dsm2 and dsm3 ehs coincide with rhs these cells were labelled as cp i e pixels where there is agreement on flood hazard categories off diagonal cells include values related to errors of omission and commission which are referred to as ec i e error or mismatch pixels in flood hazard categories fig 4 a confusion matrix provides a thorough assessment of agreement and error distribution between flood hazard categories however understanding it requires indices to summarize confusion matrix information in this research the overall accuracy oa served as one of the global indices story and congalton 1986 it is the ratio between the total number of successfully categorized elements cells of the main diagonal and the total number of matrix cells moreover the kappa coefficient kc congalton et al 1983 was employed which is the difference between the agreement percentage supplied by the main matrix diagonal and the chance of agreement derived from the marginal

consistency and vertical accuracy of the dsms developed dsm1 defined urban like geometry thus streets and the chorrer√≥n stream cross sections revealed consistent rectangular shapes figs 5 and 6 in dsm2 street cross sections coherently represented their geometry but unlike dsm1 the angle between streets and buildings was not orthogonal fig 5 in the chorrer√≥n stream cross sections 1 and 2 were v shaped defining smaller cross sectional areas than the real ones fig 6 in dsm3 street cross sections also displayed v shapes and saw like shapes in which high and low points alternated without transition defining 6 metre elevation differences fig 5 see cross sections 1 and 2 in the chorrer√≥n stream dsm3 cross sections were like dsm2 ones fig 6 regarding longitudinal profiles dsm1 defined uniform slopes fig 5 however dsm2 s profile pattern was irregular thus longitudinal profile 2 had a consistent slope but longitudinal profile 1 had height variances of up to 3 m fig 5 in dsm3 longitudinal profiles displayed erratic morphologies that do not match street patterns in cities fig 5 in the chorrer√≥n stream longitudinal profiles from the three dsms showed more resemblance than in streets thus they displayed uneven patterns with altimetric fluctuations below half a meter but sometimes exceeding 1 5 m fig 6 see longitudinal profile 1 concerning the vertical accuracy of the dsms table s1 of the supplementary data displays the vertical accuracy of the dsms by comparing them to cadastral data over the four zones for dsm1 the four zones had coefficients of determination values above 0 99 dsm2 had comparable results for dsm3 the coefficient of determination in zone 4 decreased below 0 95 suggesting a worse representation of this model in streets with higher complexity based on centrality measures dsm1 had higher mean and median errors in zones 1 3 than dsm2 and dsm3 in zone 4 however dsm1 had lower mean and median errors than dsm3 dsm2 performed best in all four zones alternative error measures such as rmse or mae tended to confirm these findings although rmse identified dsm1 s advantage over the other two dsms in zone 4 dispersion and shape metrics of elevation errors show that dsm1 had the lowest elevation error range in zones 1 and 4 and second lowest in zones 2 and 3 very close to dsm2 dsm1 had the lowest standard error and standard deviation in zone 4 indicating reduced elevation error fluctuation concerning kurtosis and skewness dsm1 s relative elevation errors displayed a closer to normal distribution fig 7 4 2 hydraulic outcomes fig 8 in relation to zone 2 depicts water depths flow velocities and froude numbers for dsm1 dsm2 and dsm3 resulting from the 500 year flood upstream of the chorrer√≥n stream alberche river junction the three dsms produced similar hydraulic outcomes however in the junction s vicinity and downstream hydrodynamic response changed significantly thus dsm2 and dsm3 disrupted water flow patterns as evidenced by the sudden depth and froude number fluctuations noticed in the alberche river dsm3 water depths ranged from 3 56 to 7 39 m in dsm2 water depths were between 3 91 and 9 20 m although the longitudinal profile was more homogeneous sharp changes in dsm3 s longitudinal water depth profile implied that the froude number shifted from less than 1 to greater than 1 these changes in the froude number also occurred in dsm2 but were less pronounced in contrast dsm1 hydraulic outputs revealed a homogeneous longitudinal water depth profile 7 09 to 9 35 m which is why changes in the froude number were not significant see a in fig 8 as regards the chorrer√≥n stream zone 3 the hydraulic response obtained from dsm1 was more homogenous thus higher and more uniform water flow velocities 0 71 1 50 m s were attained in contrast dsm2 and dsm3 exhibited much fewer uniform velocities in the chorrer√≥n stream as velocity was noticeably reduced thus dsm2 and dsm3 displayed minimum velocities of 0 40 m s and 0 18 m s respectively see b in fig 8 flooding downstream of the navaluenga s national road see e in fig 8 affected the urban area differently in the three dsms see c in fig 8 so water flow follows the street network in dsm1 whereas in dsm2 and dsm3 water flow discontinuities were identified fig 9 illustrates the flood hydraulic performance of the three dsms at the chorrer√≥n alberche confluence during the 500 year flood zone 3 again dsm1 had more consistent hydraulic outputs with the main channel s physical limits readily discernible see a in fig 9 and floods matching the building perimeters dsm2 and particularly dsm3 had erratic depths and velocities bridges in dsm3 lacked water flow spans preventing water from travelling through as a result dsm3 bridges functioned similarly to weirs crossing the river channel see b in fig 9 limiting the river s capacity to evacuate floods this caused a rise in depths upstream resulting in lateral overflows and faking floods see c in fig 9 when the bridge deck was exceeded downstream velocities rose and a critical regime was generated see d in fig 9 this increase in velocities was less noticeable in dsm1 since there was only a small acceleration while crossing the bridge spans dsm2 exhibited a hydraulic performance comparable to dsm1 see e in fig 9 the right bank of the chorrer√≥n stream upstream of its alberche river junction had the most changes zone 4 depending on the dsm the flood extent in this area see d in fig 8 varied substantially almost all of zone 4 s streets were flooded in dsm1 and dsm2 however dsm2 results misrepresented the flooded area and buildings dsm3 s flood extent for zone 4 was significantly lower than that of dsm1 and dsm2 fig 10 details the differences described above for the 500 year flood it shows two benchmark cross sections cs1 and cs2 located in zone 4 in cs1 dsm1 had depths close to 4 0 m while dsm3 depths were 1 5 m to 3 0 m in dsm2 cs1 depths ranged from 0 50 to 3 86 m in cs2 there was no water flow through dsm2 and dsm3 while in dsm1 there was a water flow across cs2 deploying depths between 0 44 m and 0 72 m regarding flow velocity the results obtained in cs1 for all three dsms were close to 0 m s dsm1 velocities in cs2 ranged from 0 54 to 0 71 m s however dsm2 and dsm3 did not deploy flow through cs2 in dsm1 and dsm2 flow velocities were less than 1 m s yet in some streets of dsm1 the flow accelerated continuously and in an orderly manner reaching 0 37 m s to 1 28 m s in dsm2 water flow was sped up in several streets to velocities comparable to dsm1 in contrast to dsm1 dsm2 displayed a discontinuous and chaotic maximum velocity pattern dsm3 performed differently from dsm1 and dsm2 because it mostly deployed flow velocities around 0 m s the respective portrayals of the chorrer√≥n stream 500 year flood by the three dsms were comparable see fig s1 of the supplementary data for the 25 year flood however the dsms differed significantly fig 11 illustrates these differences and as shown in fig 10 two cross sections cs1 and cs2 were used as a benchmark for comparison around cs1 dsm2 and dsm3 had a significant right bank overflow but dsm1 had essentially none in cs2 dsm1 depths revealed a clear contrast between channel flow 1 72 m and bank flooding a few centimetres this pattern was also noticeable in dsm2 and dsm3 although downstream of cs2 flooded urban area depths were 1 3 m whereas in dsm1 the depth was 0 8 m see b in fig 11 dsm1 had the best water flow continuity reducing lateral overflows into surrounding streets this meant for example that a street was flooded according to dsm3 and to some extent dsm2 but not dsm1 see a in fig 11 concerning flow velocities maximum values were obtained in dsm1 cs1 1 64 m s cs2 1 11 m s while the lowest ones were reported in dsm3 cs1 0 96 m s cs2 0 71 m s the simulated flow velocities in dsm2 ranged from 0 68 m s cs2 to 1 02 m s cs1 the hydraulic outputs of water depth and flow velocity displayed by each dsm as well as the resulting flood hazard maps are available for unrestricted download in the open access zenodo repository https doi org 10 5281 zenodo 5171778 aroca jim√©nez et al 2021 4 3 level of agreement on flooding outcomes elicited from dsm1 dsm2 and dsm3 4 3 1 matching degree of flooded areas for scenario 1 in zone 2 dsm2 and dsm3 set for higher matching with dsm1 since the f statistic in both dsms was more than 87 in zone 3 the f statistic defined values of 80 in dsm3 and 86 in dsm2 in zone 4 dsm3 scored badly f statistic 64 while dsm2 matched similarly in zones 2 and 3 f statistic 82 for scenario 2 in zone 2 the f statistic varied between 82 dsm3 and 86 dsm2 in zone 3 the f statistic dropped to 68 dsm3 and 74 dsm2 in zone 4 the matching level of dsm2 was the worst f statistic 59 while the agreement degree of dsm3 also declined f statistic 62 for scenario 3 dsm2 performed better than dsm3 so in zone 2 the f statistic ranged between 71 dsm3 and 79 dsm2 in zone 3 dsm3 delivered an f statistic of 68 while the f statistic provided by dsm2 was 76 in zone 4 the f statistic corresponding to dsm3 decreased to 36 while the match percentage supplied by dsm2 was 66 for scenario 4 in zone 2 the f statistics ranged between 63 dsm3 and 72 dsm2 whereas in zones 3 and 4 the f statistics were 48 and 62 respectively table 1 4 3 2 degree of agreement between flood hazard outcomes at the pixel level the confusion matrices can be consulted in tables s2 s5 of the supplementary data they contain estimates of global indices i e oa and kc and category level indices i

0 06 dsm3 and 0 11 dsm2 showing a minor level of agreement in zone 3 the oa for dsm2 and dsm3 was 59 and 57 respectively the kc for dsm2 and dsm3 were 0 40 and 0 37 moderate and fair level of agreement regarding the hfh category zone 2 had the best agreements pa and ua specified values exceeding 90 for the hfh category in dsm2 and dsm3 in zone 3 dsm2 produced 83 and 84 concerning ua and pa whereas dsm3 delivered 78 ua and 84 pa in zone 4 dsm2 indicated that the ua was 53 and the pa was 65 the results of dsm3 were 70 ua and 50 pa for the remaining flood hazard categories in zone 2 dsm2 recorded uas ranging from 41 mfh to 43 lfh and pas from 40 lfh to 52 mfh dsm3 defined uas from 42 mfh to 43 lfh and pas from 40 lfh to 48 mfh in zone 3 dsm2 and dsm3 reported agreements like those of zone 2 compared to zones 2 and 3 dsm2 agreements for lfh and mfh categories were poorer in zone 4 as uas were 25 mfh to 38 lfh and pas were 33 lfh to 41 mfh regarding dsm3 lfh agreements in zone 4 were like those in zones 2 and 3 lower values were recorded for the mfh category ua 25 pa 26 while the hfh category reported ua and pa outcomes of 70 and 50 respectively these disagreements resulted in different flood hazard categories in dsm1 dsm2 and dsm3 thus dsm1 and dsm3 overlapped flood hazard categories in 72 of pixels in zone 2 57 in zone 3 and 31 in zone 4 in zones 2 3 and 4 where flood hazard categories did not overlap pixels mirrored those of locations where neither dsm1 nor dsm3 deployed floods i e 13 in zone 2 19 in zone 3 and 41 in zone 4 fig 12 in addition 7 of the pixels in zone 2 11 in zone 3 and 21 in zone 4 underestimated the flood hazard category provided by dsm1 conversely 8 of the pixels in zone 2 13 in zone 3 and 7 in zone 4 overestimated the flood hazard category provided by dsm1 in scenario 1 dsm2 yielded findings that were comparable with dsm3 fig s2 of the supplementary data 4 3 2 2 scenario 2 dsm2 gave comparable oas and kcs for zones 2 3 and 4 as in scenario 1 dsm3 showed similar outcomes for zones 2 and 3 as in scenario 1 in zone 4 dsm3 showed more agreement oa 42 kc 0 17 minor agreement than scenario1 comparing dsm2 with dsm3 it was found that dsm3 reported oas between 42 and 64 and kcs between 0 17 minor agreement and 0 42 moderate agreement for zones 2 3 and 4 like those derived from dsm2 oas between 39 and 71 and kcs between 0 11 minor agreement and 0 52 moderate agreement at the flood hazard category level dsm2 and dsm3 provided similar outcomes to those of scenario 1 in zone 2 and for the hfh category for the remaining flood hazard categories in zone 2 dsm2 produced a stronger agreement uas and pas were between 49 and 57 than under scenario 1 uas and pas were between 40 and 43 whereas dsm3 performed similarly in scenario

69 compared to dsm2 and dsm3 dsm2 reported higher pas and uas in zone 2 and for all hazard categories for zone 3 the same conclusion was obtained as for zone 2 except that the percentage of pa related to hfh was higher in dsm3 89 than in dsm2 73 in zone 4 dsm3 exhibited greater pa and ua in the lfh category than dsm2 dsm2 performed better in the mfh ua 49 pa 43 than dsm3 ua 41 pa 38 in the hfh

zone 4 this percentage was reduced to 39 most pixels 14 in zone 2 26 in zone 3 and 40 in zone 4 corresponded to locations where dsm2 did not record flooding but dsm1 did or vice versa the remaining percentages 15 in zone 2 24 in zone 3 and 21 in zone 4 pertain to places where dsm2 overestimated or underestimated flood hazard categories compared to dsm1 fig 13 zone 2 had the largest proportion of dsm3 matches 64 compared to zones 3 and 4 each of which had 42 the most mismatched pixels in dsm1 and dsm3 belonged to locations where dsm1 did not record flooding but dsm3 did 13 in zone 2 28 in zone 3 and 24 in zone 4 while places where dsm1 reported flooding but dsm3 did not do so represented 5 in zones 2 and 3 and 13 in zone 4 in zone 2 18 of dsm3 pixels overestimated or underestimated the flood hazard categories that dsm1 displayed this percentage rose to 25 in zone 3 and 21 in zone 4 fig s3 of the supplementary data 4 3 2 3 scenario 3 oa in zone 2 was 63 in dsm2 and 51 in dsm3 dsm2 had a kc of 0 46 moderate agreement in this zone whereas dsm3 yielded a kc of 0 32 fair agreement the estimated percentages of oas in zone 3 were 55 dsm2 and 47 dsm3 in both cases estimated kcs of 0

dsm3 reported uas and pas ranging from 81 to 88 when hfh was considered dsm2 provided uas and pas between 52 and 60 for the remaining flood hazard categories whereas dsm3 varied between 32 and 50 in zone 3 uas and pas for dsm2 and dsm3 hfh category fluctuated between 70 and 81 dsm2 displayed more agreement than dsm3 for the other flood hazard categories with uas and pas defining outcomes comparable to zone 2 dsm3 yielded a higher ua than dsm2 when considering hfh in zone 4 82 vs 54 the pa was higher in dsm2 than in dsm3 69 vs 55 dsm2 uas and pas for mfh and lfh categories were between 49 and 61 whereas dsm3 outputs were between 12 and 41 due to disagreements between dsm1 and dsm3 match percentages in zones 2 and 3 were lower 51 and 47 respectively than between dsm1 and dsm2 63 and 55 in zone 4 matching between dsm1 and dsm3 was much lower with 18 of pixels identifying the same flood hazard category compared to 46 for dsm1 and dsm2 fig 14 and fig s4 of the supplementary data for zone 2 mismatches were caused by pixels that did not record flooding in dsm3 10 but were inundated in dsm1 or pixels that did not report flooding in dsm1 19 but were flooded in dsm3 in zones 3 and 4 non overlap was owing to the absence of floods in dsm3 19 and 56 of pixels respectively regarding dsm2 13 of zone 2 pixels that did not match with dsm1 were due to the absence of floods in dsm1 this proportion fell to 11 in zone 3 whereas 14 reported flooding in dsm1 but not dsm2 24 of non overlapping pixels in zone 4 showed flooding in dsm2 but not dsm1 fig 14 and fig s4 of the supplementary data in zone 2 around 9 of pixels in dsm2 and dsm3 underestimated the flood hazard category described by dsm1 whereas 8 and 11 of the remaining pixels in dsm2 and dsm3 overestimated it in zone 3 12 of dsm2 pixels underestimated the flood hazard category compared to dsm1 when dsm3 outcomes were analysed this percentage increased to 13 8 of dsm2 and dsm3 pixels overestimated the flood hazard category in zone 4 4 of the dsm3 pixels overestimated the flood hazard category compared to dsm1 increasing to 12 when dsm2 results were reviewed besides 8 of dsm2 pixels underestimated the flood hazard category provided by dsm1 increasing to 14 with dsm3 fig 14 and fig s4 of the supplementary data 4 3 2 4 scenario 4 for scenario 4 neither dsm2 nor dsm3 showed pixel flooding in zone 4 in this scenario dsm2 performed worse in zones 2 and 3 than it did in scenario 3 consequently oas ranged from 44 to 54 and kcs were between 0 06 minor and 0 32 fair while in scenario 3 oas ranged from 55 to

zone 2 dsm2 performed better than dsm3 for the hfh category with uas and pas between 28 and 76 compared to 14 and 61 for dsm3 these percentages were lower than those projected for the same category of

presented spatially fig 15 and fig s5 of the supplementary data dsm2 and dsm3 exhibited similar oas in zone 2 compared to dsm1 between 51 and 54 where there was disagreement around 19 of the flood hazard projections from dsm2 and dsm3 were not represented in dsm1 in contrast 11 of pixels were flooded in dsm1 but not in dsm2 or dsm3 on the other hand roughly 8 of pixels in dsm2 and dsm3 underestimated the flood hazard category in dsm1 while about 10 overestimated it in zone 3 dsm2 outperformed dsm3 defining an oa of 44 as opposed to 34 for dsm3 in addition 23 and 32 respectively of the pixels flooded by dsm2 and dsm3 were not flooded by dsm1 in contrast whereas 10 of pixels in dsm2 overestimated the flood hazard category relative to dsm1 outcomes this percentage increased to 18 when dsm3 outcomes were evaluated moreover 3 of dsm3 pixels underestimated the flood hazard category as opposed to 6 of dsm2 pixels compared to dsm1 17 of dsm2 pixels and 13 of dsm3 pixels were not flooded while pixels that were flooded in dsm2 and dsm3 but not in dsm1 accounted for 23 and 32 respectively 5 discussion highly accurate dsms can be generated utilizing lidar datasets which offer high point spatial density and vertical accuracy accordingly to acquire trustworthy topographic data on a large scale lidar data is suggested hohenthal et al 2011 however like any discrete measurement technique lidar data has object space ambiguities which is relevant in urban settings where buildings and streets along with the floodplain represent a complicated landscape that can only be accurately depicted by employing ancillary information e g through the addition of breaklines to a triangulated irregular network tin bodoque et al 2016 another drawback of lidar data lies in the errors caused by automated point cloud classification techniques these inaccuracies may lead to elements such as flowerpots awnings or vehicles being wrongly classified as ground shan and sampath 2005 this may generate false obstructions to water flow which leads to errors in flood hazard assessments even though lidar data has these flaws it usually does not indicate in research papers what pre processing tasks must be undertaken before incorporating it into 2d hydrodynamic models to create flood hazard maps according to our knowledge the research presented here is the first to examine the detrimental impact of adopting geometrically inconsistent dsms for urban areas on flood hazard assessment besides few studies give procedures for obtaining dsms of urban areas and there are only a few papers in the literature that describe the added value of dsms using lidar data in urban flood analyses for instance lidar data has been used to provide distributed assessments of urban water level and extent neal et al 2009 fewtrell et al 2011 schubert et al 2008 used semi automated approaches for geospatial data processing to enable mesh generation building representation and resistance parameter estimation other papers have focused on applying and testing numerical schemes with different surface friction configurations on high resolution dsms derived from terrestrial lidar ozdemir et al 2013 on investigating the sensitivity of flood damage assessments concerning the quality of dsms and building representation arrighi and campo 2019 or on the extraction of building facade openings e g windows doors to assess flood risk feng et al 2022 fewer published papers address the issue of how to build dsms which allow the characterization of flow paths beneath urban objects such as elevated roads and overpasses noh et al 2018 or how to construct dsms that properly portray the surface of urban areas meesuk et al 2015 the purpose of this research was to establish the requirements for obtaining geometrically consistent dsms of urban areas to develop trustworthy flood hazard maps to this end an application oriented approach to producing dsms has been developed referred to as dsm1 in this study in which the primary drainage paths of urban areas at risk of river flooding e g the street building system were accurately geometrically depicted dsm1 was compared using qualitative and quantitative approaches to a model that represents urban streets but not buildings dsm2 and a third model dsm3 created using direct interpolation of lidar data this comparison aimed to characterize the geometric quality and vertical accuracy of these dsms moreover differences found in flood hazard mapping resulting from each dsm were examined in this study it was assumed that the success of employing direct interpolation of lidar data to construct geometrically consistent dsms is dependent on the complexity of the surface being mapped to test this assumption the study area was divided into four zones with zone 1 which was only considered for assessing the vertical accuracy of dsms being the least complicated from a geometric standpoint since it includes non urban and peri urban areas and zone 4 being the most complex because it has the most buildings and streets zones 2 and 3 exhibited features midway between zones 1 and 4 zones 2 3 and 4 were utilized to test the levels of agreement between dsm2 and dsm3 with dsm1 regarding flood hazard assessment the impact of geometric inconsistency on flood hazard mapping was also evaluated to do this four scenarios were explored i scenario 1 depicts the 500 year flood in both the alberche and the chorrer√≥n streams ii scenario 2 portrays the 25 year flood in both the alberche river and the chorrer√≥n stream iii scenario 3 captures the 500 year flood in the chorrer√≥n stream and iv scenario 4 illustrates the 25 year flood in the chorrer√≥n stream the findings reported here demonstrate divergences in the geometric configurations of dsm2 and dsm3 compared to dsm1 which served as the benchmark the differences were largest in zone 4 which contains the most buildings and streets and a more complicated geometric arrangement and lowest in zone 2 which has more undeveloped and peri urban land comparing the performance of dsm2 and dsm3 figs 5 and 6 it was found that in dsm2 cross sections streets often exhibited a smaller area than the real one since the dsm s construction did not account for buildings the geometric portrayal of dsm3 is even farther from reality since a qualitative analysis of the longitudinal and transversal profiles of streets figs 5 and 6 revealed the presence of artificial barriers with a high capacity to disrupt flood wave propagation because neither dsms considered adding breaklines to consistently portray the chorrer√≥n stream channelling the morphological patterns in dsm2 and dsm3 were comparable with smaller cross sections compared to the real ones dsm1 showed transverse and longitudinal profiles for streets and the chorrer√≥n stream that are consistent with navaluenga s geometric configuration these findings agree with zhou et al 2004 who showed that lidar data interpolation algorithms perform poorly when there are abrupt fluctuations in elevation geometric inconsistency in dsm3 and to a lesser extent in dsm2 affected flood hazard maps since 2d hydrodynamic model outputs depend on proper site geometry aronica et al 2012 the level of agreement was lower as the geometric discrepancy with dsm1 rose both at the level of the total flooded area calculated using the f statistic and at the level of the predicted flood hazard category for each pixel determined from the indices extracted from the confusion matrices flood hazard outputs from dsm3 were less in accord with dsm1 than dsm2 this was due to dsm3 displaying a geometric arrangement that was farther from reality than dsm2 in preferential flow pathways streets and the urban reach of the chorrer√≥n stream dsm2 and particularly dsm3 typically generated smaller cross sections than the true ones by creating triangulations that defined artificial barriers that hinder or restrict the passage of the flood wave consequently increased water depths and more varied velocity patterns were deployed distorting flood magnitude accordingly flood hazard may define distinct flood hazard categories depending on the dsm employed as well as streets that flood in dsm2 and dsm3 but not flooding in dsm1 and vice versa flood hazard outputs from dsm2 and dsm3 showed a higher agreement with dsm1 when analysing 500 year flood scenarios while such agreements were lower when examining 25 year flood scenarios this is because the geometric inconsistency of dsms has less of an effect on flood hazard outputs with increasing water levels during floods flood hazard mapping is a critical tool for managing flood risk as it enables potentially flood prone areas to be identified and analysed for their risk mudashiru et al 2021 flood hazard mapping may also be used to aid in the planning and development of flood protection and evacuation procedures musolino et al 2020 another use of flood hazard mapping is that it can be employed to educate the public about flood risk and how to protect themselves and their property in the event of a flood henstra et al 2019 the findings presented here reveal that the geometric consistency of the dsms used to adjust the node height of the elements comprising the computational mesh has a large impact on the outputs of 2d hydrodynamic models and therefore on flood hazard assessments if there is no geometric consistency the flooded area and flood hazard categories indicated in the maps may vary considerably from what is expected jeopardizing the credibility of flood risk assessments and the efficacy of flood risk mitigation measures consequently the development of geometrically consistent dsms is a critical step in developing new tools to mitigate the possible effects of floods via risk management supported by hazard and risk mapping 6 conclusions this study provides an application oriented procedure for constructing geometrically and vertically accurate urban dsms designated here as dsm1 given the above lidar data is especially valuable for producing consistent dsms when supplemented with ancillary information such as break lines which enables a precise portrayal of slope breaks common in urban settings e g between streets and buildings through the f statistic and comprehensive and category level indices produced from a confusion matrix this work also looked into the effects of using dsms that do not adequately portray urban geometry on flood hazard assessments this research provides beyond a doubt that dsms that are not geometrically consistent dsm2 and dsm3 in this paper have a detrimental impact on flood hazard estimates because geometrically robust dsms are a highly sensitive input for obtaining reliable flood hazard maps a lack of geometric consistency in dsms causes significant errors in the distribution of depths and velocities as well as the spatial distribution of hazard categories and the area occupied by the flooding zone which may lead decision makers to take the wrong decisions during the flood risk management process so making sure that dsms are geometrically consistent is important because flood hazard mapping helps protect people and economic assets from flooding while also letting communities keep control over urban growth in floodplains as a result spatial planners may restrict development to the best available sites provided they have access to reliable and up to date data on the flood hazard in a given area credit authorship contribution statement jos√© m bodoque

2538,digital surface models dsms are crucial in providing accurate urban flood hazard maps the ubiquitous availability of lidar data where accessible makes constructing geometrically sound dsms feasible however little attention has been paid to developing approaches for producing geometrically consistent dsms herein is described an application driven procedure for creating a geometrically robust dsm dsm1 two further dsms were created one for portraying streets using breaklines as ancillary information dsm2 and the other through direct interpolation of lidar data dsm3 the geometrical correctness and vertical accuracy of these dsms were examined qualitatively and quantitatively by plotting longitudinal profiles and cross sections onto major runoff pathways and determining statistical error the effect of these dsms geometric consistency on flood hazard maps was also evaluated for this hydraulic outputs from dsm1 were used as a benchmark to compare hydraulic outputs from dsm2 and dsm3 this comparison was conducted at two spatial resolutions i at the total area flooded using the f statistic and ii at the pixel level by employing global indices and category level indices extracted from a confusion matrix our findings revealed that 1 dsm1 defined the most geometrically coherent configurations for runoff pathways 2 in urban areas with the most densely packed streets and buildings dsm2 and particularly dsm3 featured the most unrealistic geometric representations of the urban domain displaying fake water flow barriers and lower than real runoff pathway cross sections and 3 the geometric quality of the dsms created had a significant impact on flood hazard maps reliability i e the disagreement in flood hazard categories between dsm2 and dsm3 and dsm1 varied from 28 to 82 these findings can be very valuable in achieving further reductions and better flood risk management keywords urban areas digital surface model lidar dataset hydraulic modelling

worldwide undrr 2020 during this period climate related disasters increased with floods accounting for 44 of all disasters wmo 2021 flood risk on the other hand is expected to rise in the coming decades owing to climate change induced increases in the frequency and magnitude of floods along with the projected global growth of the exposed population and assets kundzewicz et al 2014 accordingly flood risk mitigation is deemed to be one of the key societal challenges to be addressed during this century o donnell and thorne 2020 coping with this challenge requires good urban flood risk management and in depth knowledge of flood hazard along river basins and coastal areas tsakiris 2014 pasquier et al 2019 such an appraisal is determined by the type of flooding e g fluvial flash floods or pluvial and the probability or return period of the flood event to be assessed as an example the eu floods directive considers the following scenarios i low probability or extreme events 500 year flood ii medium probability 100 year flood and iii high probability where appropriate 10 year flood further flood magnitude is considered prinos et al 2008 mudashiru et al 2021 in the context outlined above flood hazard maps are essential for reporting vulnerabilities and risks masood and takeuchi 2012 this mapping also facilitates the implementation of successful risk management strategies based on preventive and preparedness actions to avoid minimize transfer share or accept flood hazards di baldassarre et al 2009 surminski and thieken 2017 flood hazard assessment is a complex process that requires determining its magnitude ideally this encompasses the specification of flood depth flood wave velocity its duration and sediment and debris loading scawthorn et al 2006 in practice the above analysis is simplified by considering flood extent water depth or eventually a combination of the two parameters above and flow velocity van alphen et al 2009 in urban areas hazard assessment and cartographic depiction rely on two dimensional 2d hydrodynamic models since in this environment it is not feasible to assume a one dimensional 1d flow vojinovic and tutulic 2009 upstream boundary conditions of 2d hydrodynamic models are generally provided by flow quantiles established through hydrological modelling or flood frequency analysis depending on the available data other mandatory inputs are land cover to estimate roughness and topography portrayed as digital surface models dsms which capture both natural and built artificial urban environment features bodoque et al 2016 dsm topographic data affects 2d hydrodynamic modelling because it influences the urban geometric layout of structured or non structured meshes utilized for numerical computations yalcin 2020 the availability of lidar data since the end of the last century offers a fast and cost effective way to get detailed dsms of urban areas priestnall et al 2000 lidar data by virtue of the very high density of recorded points allows modelling and flood mapping with a horizontal spatial resolution of 1 to 2 m and a z precision of a few decimetres costabile et al 2015 however producing dsms from lidar data for flood hazard modelling and mapping is not straightforward this is because lidar data alone cannot sufficiently capture topographic breaks especially in complicated geometric configurations such as urban areas turner et al 2013 to make the above possible lidar data must be coupled with 3d breaklines that complement mass points reinforcing topographic breakdowns inside triangulated irregular networks tins liu 2008 the best way to identify breaklines is to employ local knowledge orthophotos and cadastral maps as data sources and gis tools to handle this information systematically bodoque et al 2016 disaggregating lidar data into ground terrain and non ground man made structures is another important stage in creating urban dsms this stage is challenging since the algorithms used to classify lidar data are not totally reliable consequently elements such as cars canopies or flowerpots are occasionally misclassified as ground causing dsms to block water flow noh et al 2018 few studies have focused on the need for geometrically correct dsms to generate reliable flood hazard maps that may subsequently be employed in urban flood risk management to the best of our knowledge there are hardly any studies on how to develop geometrically sound urban dsms that display preferential drainage pathways and urban features that obstruct water flow i e buildings and walls in this regard the papers by meesuk et al 2015 and noh et al 2018 serve as examples in addition there does not seem to be any research examining the effects of using dsms that are not geometrically robust on the hydraulic performance of flooded areas in terms of water depth and flow velocity which commonly dictate the layout of flood hazard maps to fill this knowledge gap this study aims to evaluate how the geometric consistency of dsms obtained from lidar data impacts on flood hazard outcomes resulting from 2d hydrodynamic modelling to begin a procedure for obtaining geometrically sound urban dsms was devised the resulting dsm henceforth denoted as dsm1 was compared to two other dsms henceforth designated as dsm2 and dsm3 built under different assumptions this was done to determine the differences in geometric configuration and flood hazard outcomes deployed by each dsm to test geometric soundness longitudinal profiles and cross sections were created for the preferential drainage pathways during flooding i e understood here as the streets buildings system vertical accuracy was also measured this was done by computing discrepancies between dsm pixel values and 2 088 points taken using differential global positioning system dgps with a vertical accuracy lower than the lidar data used here in addition it was assessed how the geometric imprecision of dsms influences the mapping of flood hazard for this purpose hydraulic outputs from dsm1 were utilized as a benchmark to compare with dsm2 and dsm3 outputs this comparison was conducted by calculating the f statistic cook and merwade 2009 and global and category level indices through a confusion matrix congalton 1991 congalton and green 1999 2 study site and data employed navaluenga is located in central spain on the banks of the alberche river between the sierra del valle gredos s eastern mountain range and the sierra de la paramera 40 24 30 n 4 42 17 w 761 m a s l fig 1 navaluenga has 2135 inhabitants data for 2021 however this figure can rise to 20 000 during the summer 4 311 dwellings are estimated with 3392 being second homes the alberche river flows 70 km from 1 800 m a s l to navaluenga this river drains 717 km2 up to this village with a time of concentration tc of 8 5 h its hydrological regime is hardly affected by human intervention as there is no important hydraulic infrastructure e g reservoirs upstream of navaluenga that regulates river water levels or the variability of river flows within navaluenga and its surroundings several torrents flow into the alberche river among these the chorrer√≥n stream tc 3 h stands out it is an ephemeral stream completely channelled in its urban reach which crosses navaluenga perpendicularly from north to south fig 1 since at least the late middle ages navaluenga has been flooded by the alberche river and the chorrer√≥n stream the 1990 s and 2000 s witnessed the most recent floods which caused economic losses and endangered locals d√≠ez herrero 2001 the dsms used here were built from the lidar data provided by the national geographic institute of spain ign raw lidar data were collected by airborne lidar systems with a density of 0 5 points m 2 and an altimetric precision z of 15 cm the reference system for this topographic dataset is the etrs89 utm zone 30 n compatible with wgs 84 using 2 088 differential gps measurements provided by the spanish general directorate of cadastre sec the elevation accuracy of the dsms was tested the study area was divided into 4 zones fig 1 i the total area of the study site which includes the urban and peri urban areas of navaluenga zone 1 ii the whole urban and peri urban floodable zone zone 2 iii the streets included within the urban floodable zone zone 3 and iv the floodable urban area with a higher density of streets and buildings zone 4 geometric consistency and elevation accuracy of dsms were investigated in zones 1 2 3 and 4 in zones 2 3 and 4 the results of hydraulic and flood hazards from each dsm were examined and compared 3 methodology the methodological approach deployed here was divided into four stages fig 2 1 developing geometrically reliable dsms for urban areas this section provides a detailed description of the procedure designed to obtain a geometrically reliable dsm dsm1 as well as the way in which the dsms dsm2 and dsm3 to be compared with dsm1 were obtained 2 evaluation of the suitability of dsms as topographic input to hydraulic models the qualitative tools used to evaluate the geometric correctness of the dsms were detailed as was the statistical approach adopted to evaluate their vertical accuracy 3 2d hydraulic modelling and flood hazard analysis it explains how the 2d hydrodynamic model was designed and implemented and the approach employed to obtain flood hazard maps and 4 comparison of flood hazard maps the quantitative indicators used to compare the flood hazard maps displayed by each dsm both at the level of the total flooded area and the flood hazard category displayed in each pixel are described 3 1 obtaining geometrically reliable dsms for urban areas when river floods affect urban areas streets are the main runoff pathways accordingly lidar point cloud processing was mainly focused on these areas the first task was to filter lidar data to select those points that were automatically classified by the ign as ground points in complex urban settings outdoor furniture e g flowerpots awnings and other elements such as vehicles can be mistakenly categorized as ground points which generate false barriers to the water flow once dsm is generated to remove these fake elements two filters were sequentially applied i points with height differences of more than 0 30 m above the average were deleted ii points with slope differences of more than 10 compared to the average were also omitted both filters were applied taking different buffers into account specifically 2 m were estimated for the filter based on the difference in height and between 1 and 5 m for the filter depending on slope for portraying streets buildings were deemed to represent their outside limits therefore the sec provided block layer was converted to points the natural neighbour s interpolation approach was then used to get elevation from the lidar ground data for the points on the border of the block layer as a frame for the street representation the ign provided centre axis of each street was employed every 2 m parallel lines to these central axes were drawn and converted into points similarly to what was done with the block layer the lidar ground data was used to assign elevation values to these points to appropriately depict dwellings buildings designated lidar data points were retrieved these points were then clipped using the sec provided building layer as a proxy for roof height the maximum point elevation per building was then extracted the collected points were linked to the 3d points of the buildings allowing for their accurate geometrical depiction regarding the alberche river riverbanks were manually digitalized using the available orthophoto as a reference bathymetry was also collected through a field survey to this end a differential gps trimble 5700 was used to obtain an average density of 0 3 points m 2 regarding the chorrer√≥n stream streambanks were manually digitalized additionally a couple of lines were drawn in parallel to the streambanks matching the streambed lidar points were used to assign surface elevation using the natural neighbour s interpolation method once all topographic data were filtered and processed a tin was created so lidar and bathymetry points were included as mass points whereas line features e g riverbanks street boundaries were added as breaklines hard lines to enforce slope breaks in the tin arrighi and campo 2019 at this phase manual adjustments were also made to the tin to integrate fieldwork identified structures e g walls levees embankments not detected by the original lidar data errors detected in the tin were also fixed last a dsm was created dsm1 by linearly interpolating the tin and using a 2 metre cell size to match the point density of the original lidar data additionally two other dsms were produced in the first dsm 2 streets were portrayed by assigning breaklines using the average las z value to produce 3d features the second dsm3 was obtained by direct interpolation of lidar data this was done to determine how different the geometry exhibited by dsm2 and dsm3 is from that of dsm1 as well as to quantitatively define how the differences in the geometric arrangement of the dsms affect the flood hazard maps that each dsm deploys dsm1 dsm2 and dsm3 have been made freely available

of dsms as topographic input to 2d hydrodynamic modelling was tested using both qualitative and quantitative criteria with the latter based on statistical sampling error approaches focused on vertical accuracy in the first approach the geometric consistency of streets and channelling along the urban reach of the chorrer√≥n stream was visually checked for each dsm in a second phase the conclusions of the previous analysis were corroborated by the layout of longitudinal profiles and cross sections of the streets buildings system and the chorrer√≥n stream a differential global positioning system dgps dataset covering navaluenga and the area around it zone 1 was used to test the vertical accuracy of dsms 2 088 points with vertical and horizontal accuracies 0 15 m were used to evaluate dsm vertical accuracy for the other zones all included within zone 1 the point samples were 546 zone 2 209 zone 3 and 55 zone 4 vertical accuracy was then evaluated by computing the difference between the pixel values of the dsms and the corresponding dgps measurements the statistical distribution of errors throughout the four zones was captured by plotting histograms normalized by their respective means so the standard deviation could be visually contrasted the error sample was further described using metrics of centrality mean and median dispersion standard deviation and range and measures of shape kurtosis and skewness vertical accuracy was determined using the root mean square error rmse and the mean absolute error mae the coefficient of determination r2 was also used to assess the dsms goodness of fit to the sample of dgps z values 3 3 2d hydraulic modelling and flood hazard analysis hydraulic modelling was performed using the iber two dimensional hydrodynamic model blad√© et al 2014 the computational mesh was generated employing the rtin regular triangular irregular network method with maximum and minimum triangle lengths of 2 m and 1 m respectively once produced the node height of the mesh elements was adjusted from the dsms to do so a threshold tolerance of 0 1 m was set which is consistent with the altimetric accuracy of the lidar data used 0 15 m upstream boundary conditions for the alberche river and the chorrer√≥n stream assumed steady state subcritical flow conditions for the 500 and 25 year floods bodoque et al 2016 bodoque et al 2020 d√≠ez herrero 2001 as a downstream boundary condition it used a subcritical regime the discharges used were 2006 m3 s 1 500 year flood and 856 m3 s 1 25 year flood for the alberche river and 167 m3 s 1 500 year flood and 10 m3 s 1 25 year flood for the chorrer√≥n stream the roughness coefficient was estimated from national land cover mapping at a scale of 1 25 000 and then allocated in accordance with chow 1959 the equivalent value of manning s n to each land use land cover unit culverts and weirs operating in the study area fig 3 were geometrically characterized and included as internal conditions in the 2d hydrodynamic model the culverts start and end locations as well as their dimensions width and height for rectangular culverts and diameter for circular culverts were examined all culverts were given a manning s n value of 0 018 a weir with a discharge coefficient of 1 7 was deemed indicative of the alberche river s urban reach also included in the computational mesh were the two bridges present in the reach fig 3 their geometry was replicated by subdividing the mesh first the coordinates of the upper chords upstream ends and deck width were established the relative coordinates and top and bottom elevations of the decks as well as the relative location and width crosswise to the flow direction of the bridge piers were to be determined next furthermore the model was only affected by the bridge piles and abutments if the water level did not reach the bridge deck when the deck height was exceeded the coefficients for free or submerged pressure flow as well as the weir coefficients with values of 0 6 0 8 and 1 7 were added before launching the simulation a second order numerical approach was considered cea and blad√© 2015 a courant friedrichs lewy number of 0 45 was employed to achieve a stable numerical scheme the wet dry limit which is the depth in metres below which an element is considered dry and is therefore left out of the hydrodynamic computation was set at 0 01 m a flood hazard analysis was given by the product of water depth and velocity rasters derived from the 2d hydrodynamic modelling d√≠ez herrero et al 2009 in this research the following flood hazard categories were considered i high flood hazard hfh ii medium flood hazard mfh iii low flood hazard lfh and iv non flooded areas nfa 3 4 comparison of flood hazard maps the objective of this evaluation was to compare dsm1 reference model flood hazard maps with those from dsm2 and dsm3 the following scenarios were examined for this purpose i scenario1 500 year flood generated by the alberche river and the chorrer√≥n stream ii scenario 2 25 year flood induced by the alberche river and the chorrer√≥n stream iii scenario 3 500 year flood triggered by the chorrer√≥n stream and iv scenario 4 25 year flood driven by the chorrer√≥n stream comparative analyses were conducted in zones 2 3 and 4 see their description at the end of section 2 two approaches were used to address the above comparison first using the f statistic cook and merwade 2009 the difference between the flooding areas of dsm1 and dsm2 and dsm3 was assessed this statistic was determined by the equation 1 f 100 aop ao a p a o p where ao is the reference inundation area derived from dsm1 ap provides the area flooded by dsm2 and dsm3 and aop is the overlapping flooding area for dsm1 dsm2 and dsm3 a score of 100 represents perfect agreement between dsm1 dsm2 and dsm3 flooding areas whereas the lower the f the greater the disagreement between dsm1 with dsm2 and dsm3 flooding areas then using pixel level statistics the agreement between the flood hazard categories from dsm1 and those from dsm2 and dsm3 was checked a confusion matrix was devised for this purpose congalton 1991 congalton and green 1999 it included values showing the degree of similarity between paired observations provided by the set of flood hazard categories derived from dsm1 or the reference dataset rd moreover the set of dsm2 and dsm3 flood hazard categories which were designated as the dataset under control duc were considered a confusion matrix is a mxm rows columns matrix where m represents the flood hazard categories under consideration rh reference hazard refers to rd classes whereas eh relates to duc classes estimated hazard the diagonal cells of the confusion matrix include values that correspond to well defined flood hazard categories from dsm2 and dsm3 ehs coincide with rhs these cells were labelled as cp i e pixels where there is agreement on flood hazard categories off diagonal cells include values related to errors of omission and commission which are referred to as ec i e error or mismatch pixels in flood hazard categories fig 4 a confusion matrix provides a thorough assessment of agreement and error distribution between flood hazard categories however understanding it requires indices to summarize confusion matrix information in this research the overall accuracy oa served as one of the global indices story and congalton 1986 it is the ratio between the total number of successfully categorized elements cells of the main diagonal and the total number of matrix cells moreover the kappa coefficient kc congalton et al 1983 was employed which is the difference between the agreement percentage supplied by the main matrix diagonal and the chance of agreement derived from the marginal values row and column totals eq 2 according to landis and koch 1977 kappa values under 0 2 imply minor 0 2 0 4 fair 0 4 0 6 moderate 0 6 0 8 substantial and 0 8 1 0 virtually perfect agreement 2 k a p

described above errors of commission or user accuracy ua and errors of omission or producer accuracy pa were also used as category level indices congalton and green 1999 the user s accuracy was calculated by dividing the number of correctly categorized pixels by the total number of pixels in each flood hazard category row total of the confusion matrix also the producer s accuracy resulted from dividing the number of correctly identified pixels in each category by the number of reference pixels utilized for that category column total of the confusion matrix 4 results 4 1 geometric consistency and vertical accuracy of the dsms developed dsm1 defined urban like geometry thus streets and the chorrer√≥n stream cross sections revealed consistent rectangular shapes figs 5 and 6 in dsm2 street cross sections coherently represented their geometry but unlike dsm1 the angle between streets and buildings was not orthogonal fig 5 in the chorrer√≥n stream cross sections 1 and 2 were v shaped defining smaller cross sectional areas than the real ones fig 6 in dsm3 street cross sections also displayed v shapes and saw like shapes in which high and low points alternated without transition defining 6 metre elevation differences fig 5 see cross sections 1 and 2 in the chorrer√≥n stream dsm3 cross sections were like dsm2 ones fig 6 regarding longitudinal profiles dsm1 defined uniform slopes fig 5 however dsm2 s profile pattern was irregular thus longitudinal profile 2 had a consistent slope but longitudinal profile 1 had height variances of up to 3 m fig 5 in dsm3 longitudinal profiles displayed erratic morphologies that do not match street patterns in cities fig 5 in the chorrer√≥n stream longitudinal profiles from the three dsms showed more resemblance than in streets thus they displayed uneven patterns with altimetric fluctuations below half a meter but sometimes exceeding 1 5 m fig 6 see longitudinal profile 1 concerning the vertical accuracy of the dsms table s1 of the supplementary data displays the vertical accuracy of the dsms by comparing them to cadastral data over the four zones for dsm1 the four zones had coefficients of determination values above 0 99 dsm2 had comparable results for dsm3 the coefficient of determination in zone 4 decreased below 0 95 suggesting a worse representation of this model in streets with higher complexity based on centrality measures dsm1 had higher mean and median errors in zones 1 3 than dsm2 and dsm3 in zone 4 however dsm1 had lower mean and median errors than dsm3 dsm2 performed best in all four zones alternative error measures such as rmse or mae tended to confirm these findings although rmse identified dsm1 s advantage over the other two dsms in zone 4 dispersion and shape metrics of elevation errors show that dsm1 had the lowest elevation error range in zones 1 and 4 and second lowest in zones 2 and 3 very close to dsm2 dsm1 had the lowest standard error and standard deviation in zone 4 indicating reduced elevation error fluctuation concerning kurtosis and skewness dsm1 s relative elevation errors displayed a closer to normal distribution fig 7 4 2 hydraulic outcomes fig 8 in relation to zone 2 depicts water depths flow velocities and froude numbers for dsm1 dsm2 and dsm3 resulting from the 500 year flood upstream of the chorrer√≥n stream alberche river junction the three dsms produced similar hydraulic outcomes however in the junction s vicinity and downstream hydrodynamic response changed significantly thus dsm2 and dsm3 disrupted water flow patterns as evidenced by the sudden depth and froude number fluctuations noticed in the alberche river dsm3 water depths ranged from 3 56 to 7 39 m in dsm2 water depths were between 3 91 and 9 20 m although the longitudinal profile was more homogeneous sharp changes in dsm3 s longitudinal water depth profile implied that the froude number shifted from less than 1 to greater than 1 these changes in the froude number also occurred in dsm2 but were less pronounced in contrast dsm1 hydraulic outputs revealed a homogeneous longitudinal water depth profile 7 09 to 9 35 m which is why changes in the froude number were not significant see a in fig 8 as regards the chorrer√≥n stream zone 3 the hydraulic response obtained from dsm1 was more homogenous thus higher and more uniform water flow velocities 0 71 1 50 m s were attained in contrast dsm2 and dsm3 exhibited much fewer uniform velocities in the chorrer√≥n stream as velocity was noticeably reduced thus dsm2 and dsm3 displayed minimum velocities of 0 40 m s and 0 18 m s respectively see b in fig 8 flooding downstream of the navaluenga s national road see e in fig 8 affected the urban area differently in the three dsms see c in fig 8 so water flow follows the street network in dsm1 whereas in dsm2 and dsm3 water flow discontinuities were identified fig 9 illustrates the flood hydraulic performance of the three dsms at the chorrer√≥n alberche confluence during the 500 year flood zone 3 again dsm1 had more consistent hydraulic outputs with the main channel s physical limits readily discernible see a in fig 9 and floods matching the building perimeters dsm2 and particularly dsm3 had erratic depths and velocities bridges in dsm3 lacked water flow spans preventing water from travelling through as a result dsm3 bridges functioned similarly to weirs crossing the river channel see b in fig 9 limiting the river s capacity to evacuate floods this caused a rise in depths upstream resulting in lateral overflows and faking floods see c in fig 9 when the bridge deck was exceeded downstream velocities rose and a critical regime was generated see d in fig 9 this increase in velocities was less noticeable in dsm1 since there was only a small acceleration while crossing the bridge spans dsm2 exhibited a hydraulic performance comparable to dsm1 see e in fig 9 the right bank of the chorrer√≥n stream upstream of its alberche river junction had the most changes zone 4 depending on the dsm the flood extent in this area see d in fig 8 varied substantially almost all of zone 4 s streets were flooded in dsm1 and dsm2 however dsm2 results misrepresented the flooded area and buildings dsm3 s flood extent for zone 4 was significantly lower than that of dsm1 and dsm2 fig 10 details the differences described above for the 500 year flood it shows two benchmark cross sections cs1 and cs2 located in zone 4 in cs1 dsm1 had depths close to 4 0 m while dsm3 depths were 1 5 m to 3 0 m in dsm2 cs1 depths ranged from 0 50 to 3 86 m in cs2 there was no water flow through dsm2 and dsm3 while in dsm1 there was a water flow across cs2 deploying depths between 0 44 m and 0 72 m regarding flow velocity the results obtained in cs1 for all three dsms were close to 0 m s dsm1 velocities in cs2 ranged from 0 54 to 0 71 m s however dsm2 and dsm3 did not deploy flow through cs2 in dsm1 and dsm2 flow velocities were less than 1 m s yet in some streets of dsm1 the flow accelerated continuously and in an orderly manner reaching 0 37 m s to 1 28 m s in dsm2 water flow was sped up in several streets to velocities comparable to dsm1 in contrast to dsm1 dsm2 displayed a discontinuous and chaotic maximum velocity pattern dsm3 performed differently from dsm1 and dsm2 because it mostly deployed flow velocities around 0 m s the respective portrayals of the chorrer√≥n stream 500 year flood by the three dsms were comparable see fig s1 of the supplementary data for the 25 year flood however the dsms differed significantly fig 11 illustrates these differences and as shown in fig 10 two cross sections cs1 and cs2 were used as a benchmark for comparison around cs1 dsm2 and dsm3 had a significant right bank overflow but dsm1 had essentially none in cs2 dsm1 depths revealed a clear contrast between channel flow 1 72 m and bank flooding a few centimetres this pattern was also noticeable in dsm2 and dsm3 although downstream of cs2 flooded urban area depths were 1 3 m whereas in dsm1 the depth was 0 8 m see b in fig 11 dsm1 had the best water flow continuity reducing lateral overflows into surrounding streets this meant for example that a street was flooded according to dsm3 and to some extent dsm2 but not dsm1 see a in fig 11 concerning flow velocities maximum values were obtained in dsm1 cs1 1 64 m s cs2 1 11 m s while the lowest ones were reported in dsm3 cs1 0 96 m s cs2 0 71 m s the simulated flow velocities in dsm2 ranged from 0 68 m s cs2 to 1 02 m s cs1 the hydraulic outputs of water depth and flow velocity displayed by each dsm as well as the resulting flood hazard maps are available for unrestricted download in the open access zenodo repository https doi org 10 5281 zenodo 5171778 aroca jim√©nez et al 2021 4 3 level of agreement on flooding outcomes elicited from dsm1 dsm2 and dsm3 4 3 1 matching degree of flooded areas for scenario 1 in zone 2 dsm2 and dsm3 set for higher matching with dsm1 since the f statistic in both dsms was more than 87 in zone 3 the f statistic defined values of 80 in dsm3 and 86 in dsm2 in zone 4 dsm3 scored badly f statistic 64 while dsm2 matched similarly in zones 2 and 3 f statistic 82 for scenario 2 in zone 2 the f statistic varied between 82 dsm3 and 86 dsm2 in zone 3 the f statistic dropped to 68 dsm3 and 74 dsm2 in zone 4 the matching level of dsm2 was the worst f statistic 59 while the agreement degree of dsm3 also declined f statistic 62 for scenario 3 dsm2 performed better than dsm3 so in zone 2 the f statistic ranged between 71 dsm3 and 79 dsm2 in zone 3 dsm3 delivered an f statistic of 68 while the f statistic provided by dsm2 was 76 in zone 4 the f statistic corresponding to dsm3 decreased to 36 while the match percentage supplied by dsm2 was

zone 4 this percentage was reduced to 39 most pixels 14 in zone 2 26 in zone 3 and 40 in zone 4 corresponded to locations where dsm2 did not record flooding but dsm1 did or vice versa the remaining percentages 15 in zone 2 24 in zone 3 and 21 in zone 4 pertain to places where dsm2 overestimated or underestimated flood hazard categories compared to dsm1 fig 13 zone 2 had the largest proportion of dsm3 matches 64 compared to zones 3 and 4 each of which had 42 the most mismatched pixels in dsm1 and dsm3 belonged to locations where dsm1 did not record flooding but dsm3 did 13 in zone 2 28 in zone 3 and 24 in zone 4 while places where dsm1 reported flooding but dsm3 did not do so represented 5 in zones 2 and 3 and 13 in zone 4 in zone 2 18 of dsm3 pixels overestimated or underestimated the flood hazard categories that dsm1 displayed this percentage rose to 25 in zone 3 and 21 in zone 4 fig s3 of the supplementary data 4 3 2 3 scenario 3 oa in zone 2 was 63 in dsm2 and 51 in dsm3 dsm2 had a kc of 0 46 moderate agreement in this zone whereas dsm3 yielded a kc of 0 32 fair agreement the estimated percentages of oas in zone 3 were 55 dsm2 and 47 dsm3 in both cases estimated kcs of 0

zone 2 mismatches were caused by pixels that did not record flooding in dsm3 10 but were inundated in dsm1 or pixels that did not report flooding in dsm1 19 but were flooded in dsm3 in zones 3 and 4 non overlap was owing to the absence of floods in dsm3 19 and 56 of pixels respectively regarding dsm2 13 of zone 2 pixels that did not match with dsm1 were due to the absence of floods in dsm1 this proportion fell to 11 in zone 3 whereas 14 reported flooding in dsm1 but not dsm2 24 of non overlapping pixels in zone 4 showed flooding in dsm2 but not dsm1 fig 14 and fig s4 of the supplementary data in zone 2 around 9 of pixels in dsm2 and dsm3 underestimated the flood hazard category described by dsm1 whereas 8 and 11 of the remaining pixels in dsm2 and dsm3 overestimated it in zone 3 12 of dsm2 pixels underestimated the flood hazard category compared to dsm1 when dsm3 outcomes were analysed this percentage increased to 13 8 of dsm2 and dsm3 pixels overestimated the flood hazard category in zone 4 4 of the dsm3 pixels overestimated the flood hazard category compared to dsm1 increasing to 12 when dsm2 results were reviewed besides 8 of dsm2 pixels underestimated the flood hazard

presented spatially fig 15 and fig s5 of the supplementary data dsm2 and dsm3 exhibited similar oas in zone 2 compared to dsm1 between 51 and 54 where there was disagreement around 19 of the flood hazard projections from dsm2 and dsm3 were not represented in dsm1 in contrast 11 of pixels were flooded in dsm1 but not in dsm2 or dsm3 on the other hand roughly 8 of pixels in dsm2 and dsm3 underestimated the flood hazard category in dsm1 while about 10 overestimated it in zone 3 dsm2 outperformed dsm3 defining an oa of 44 as opposed to 34 for dsm3 in addition 23 and 32 respectively of the pixels flooded by dsm2 and dsm3 were not flooded by dsm1 in contrast whereas 10 of pixels in dsm2 overestimated the flood hazard category relative to dsm1 outcomes this percentage increased to 18 when dsm3 outcomes were evaluated moreover 3 of dsm3 pixels underestimated the flood hazard category as opposed to 6 of dsm2 pixels compared to dsm1 17 of dsm2 pixels and 13 of dsm3 pixels were not flooded while pixels that were flooded in dsm2 and dsm3 but not in dsm1 accounted for 23 and 32 respectively 5 discussion highly accurate dsms can be generated utilizing lidar datasets which offer high point spatial density and vertical accuracy accordingly to acquire trustworthy topographic data on a large scale lidar data is suggested hohenthal et al 2011 however like any discrete measurement technique lidar data has object space ambiguities which is relevant in urban settings where buildings and streets along with the floodplain represent a complicated landscape that can only be accurately depicted by employing ancillary information e g through the addition of breaklines to a triangulated irregular network tin bodoque et al 2016 another drawback of lidar data lies in the errors caused by automated point cloud classification techniques these inaccuracies may lead to elements such as flowerpots awnings or vehicles being wrongly classified as ground shan and sampath 2005 this may generate false obstructions to water flow which leads to errors in flood hazard assessments even though lidar data has these flaws it usually does not indicate in research papers what pre processing tasks must be undertaken before incorporating it into 2d hydrodynamic models to create flood hazard maps according to our knowledge the research presented here is the first to examine the detrimental impact of adopting geometrically inconsistent dsms for urban areas on flood hazard assessment besides few studies give procedures for obtaining dsms of urban areas and there are only a few papers in the literature that describe the added value of dsms using lidar data in urban flood analyses for instance lidar data has been used to provide distributed assessments of urban water level and extent neal et al 2009 fewtrell et al 2011 schubert et al 2008 used semi automated approaches for geospatial data processing to enable mesh generation building representation and resistance parameter estimation other papers have focused on applying and testing numerical schemes with different surface friction configurations on high resolution dsms derived from terrestrial lidar ozdemir et al 2013 on investigating the sensitivity of flood damage assessments concerning the quality of dsms and building representation arrighi and campo 2019 or on the extraction of building facade openings e g windows doors to assess flood risk feng et al 2022 fewer published papers address the issue of how to build dsms which allow the characterization of flow paths beneath urban objects such as elevated roads and overpasses noh et al 2018 or how to construct dsms that properly portray the surface of urban areas meesuk et al 2015 the purpose of this research was to establish the requirements for obtaining geometrically consistent dsms of urban areas to develop trustworthy flood hazard maps to this end an application oriented approach to producing dsms has been developed referred to as dsm1 in this study in which the primary drainage paths of urban areas at risk of river flooding e g the street building system were accurately geometrically depicted dsm1 was compared using qualitative and quantitative approaches to a model that represents urban streets but not buildings dsm2 and a third model dsm3 created using direct interpolation of lidar data this comparison aimed to characterize the geometric quality and vertical accuracy of these dsms moreover differences found in flood hazard mapping resulting from each dsm were examined in this study it was assumed that the success of employing direct interpolation of lidar data to construct geometrically consistent dsms is dependent on the complexity of the surface being mapped to test this assumption the study area was divided into four zones with zone 1 which was only considered for assessing the vertical accuracy of dsms being the least complicated from a geometric standpoint since it includes non urban and peri urban areas and zone 4 being the most complex because it has the most buildings and streets zones 2 and 3 exhibited features midway between zones 1 and 4 zones 2 3 and 4 were utilized to test the levels of agreement between dsm2 and dsm3 with dsm1 regarding flood hazard assessment the impact of geometric inconsistency on flood hazard mapping was also evaluated to do this four scenarios were explored i scenario 1 depicts the 500 year flood in both the alberche and the chorrer√≥n streams ii scenario 2 portrays the 25 year flood in both the alberche river and the chorrer√≥n stream iii scenario 3 captures the 500 year flood in the chorrer√≥n stream and iv scenario 4 illustrates the 25 year flood in the chorrer√≥n stream the findings reported here demonstrate divergences in the geometric configurations of dsm2 and dsm3 compared to dsm1 which served as the benchmark the differences were largest in zone 4 which contains the most buildings and streets and a more complicated geometric arrangement and lowest in zone 2 which has more undeveloped and peri urban land comparing the performance of dsm2 and dsm3 figs 5 and 6 it was found that in dsm2 cross sections streets often exhibited a smaller area than the real one since the dsm s construction did not account for buildings the geometric portrayal of dsm3 is even farther from reality since a qualitative analysis of the longitudinal and transversal profiles of streets figs 5 and 6 revealed the presence of artificial barriers with a high capacity to disrupt flood wave propagation because neither dsms considered adding breaklines to consistently portray the chorrer√≥n stream channelling the morphological patterns in dsm2 and dsm3 were comparable with smaller cross sections compared to the real ones dsm1 showed transverse and longitudinal profiles for streets and the chorrer√≥n stream that are consistent with navaluenga s geometric configuration these findings agree with zhou et al 2004 who showed that lidar data interpolation algorithms perform poorly when there are abrupt fluctuations in elevation geometric inconsistency in dsm3 and to a lesser extent in dsm2 affected flood hazard maps since 2d hydrodynamic model outputs depend on proper site geometry aronica et al 2012 the level of agreement was lower as the geometric discrepancy with dsm1 rose both at the level of the total flooded area calculated using the f statistic and at the level of the predicted flood hazard category for each pixel determined from the indices extracted from the confusion matrices flood hazard outputs from dsm3 were less in accord with dsm1 than dsm2 this was due to dsm3 displaying a geometric arrangement that was farther from reality than dsm2 in preferential flow pathways streets and the urban reach of the chorrer√≥n stream dsm2 and particularly dsm3 typically generated smaller cross sections than the true ones by creating triangulations that defined artificial barriers that hinder or restrict the passage of the flood wave consequently increased water depths and more varied velocity patterns were deployed distorting flood magnitude accordingly flood hazard may define distinct flood hazard categories depending on the dsm employed as well as streets that flood in dsm2 and dsm3 but not flooding in dsm1 and vice versa flood hazard outputs from dsm2 and dsm3 showed a higher agreement with dsm1 when analysing 500 year flood scenarios while such agreements were lower when examining 25 year flood scenarios this is because the geometric inconsistency of dsms has less of an effect on flood hazard outputs with increasing water levels during floods flood hazard mapping is a critical tool for managing flood risk as it enables potentially flood prone areas to be identified and analysed for their risk mudashiru et al 2021 flood hazard mapping may also be used to aid in the planning and development of flood protection and evacuation procedures musolino et al 2020 another use of flood hazard mapping is that it can be employed to educate the public about flood risk and how to protect themselves and their property in the event of a flood henstra et al 2019 the findings presented here reveal that the geometric consistency of the dsms used to adjust the node height of the elements comprising the computational mesh has a large impact on the outputs of 2d hydrodynamic models and therefore on flood hazard assessments if there is no geometric consistency the flooded area and flood hazard categories indicated in the maps may vary considerably from what is expected jeopardizing the credibility of flood risk assessments and the efficacy of flood risk mitigation measures consequently the development of geometrically consistent dsms is a critical step in developing new tools to mitigate the possible effects of floods via risk management supported by hazard and risk mapping 6 conclusions this study provides an application oriented procedure for constructing geometrically and vertically accurate urban dsms designated here as dsm1 given the above lidar data is especially valuable for producing consistent dsms when supplemented with ancillary information such as break lines which enables a precise portrayal of slope breaks common in urban settings e g between streets and buildings through the f statistic and comprehensive and category level indices produced from a confusion matrix this work also looked into the effects of using dsms that do not adequately portray urban geometry on flood hazard assessments this research provides beyond a doubt that dsms that are not geometrically consistent dsm2 and dsm3 in this paper have a detrimental impact on flood hazard estimates because geometrically robust dsms are a highly sensitive input for obtaining reliable flood hazard maps a lack of geometric consistency in dsms causes significant errors in the distribution of depths and velocities as well as the spatial distribution of hazard categories and the area occupied by the flooding zone which may lead decision makers to take the wrong decisions during the flood risk management process so making sure that dsms are geometrically consistent is important because flood hazard mapping helps protect people and economic assets from flooding while also letting communities keep control over urban growth in floodplains as a result spatial planners may restrict development to the best available sites provided they have access to reliable and up to date data on the flood hazard in a given area credit authorship contribution statement jos√© m bodoque

2539,droughts can affect a multitude of public and private sectors with impacts developing slowly over time while droughts are traditionally quantified in relation to the hydrological components of the water cycle that they affect this manuscript demonstrates a novel approach to assess future drought conditions through the lens of the water energy food ecosystem wefe nexus concept to this end a set of standardized drought indices specifically designed to represent different nexus sectors across 50 catchments in sweden was computed based on an ensemble of past and future climate model simulations different patterns in the response of the four nexus sectors water energy food and ecosystem services to future climate change emerged with different response times and drought durations across the sectors these results offer new insights into the propagation of drought through the wefe nexus in cold climates they further suggest that future drought projections can be better geared towards decision makers by basing them on standardized drought indices that were specifically tailored to represent particular nexus sectors keywords droughts wefe nexus water energy food ecosystems propagation indices streamflow hydropower agriculture forests drinking water supply sweden abbreviations wefe nexus water energy food ecosystem nexus data availability all the data used in this study is freely available in public databases hosted by the swedish meteorological and hydrological institute relevant references and links are provided in the paper 1 introduction despite affecting every continent having vast socio economic and environmental impacts droughts often elude headlines this is partially due to their slow onsets long durations and recovery times which make it difficult to predict and quantify their impacts rajsekhar et al 2015 spinoni et al 2015 droughts are usually characterized by their severity locality duration and timing the term drought is distinct from water scarcity in that drought is an episodic socio climatologically induced water deficit caused by an anomaly in average conditions whereas water scarcity is a long term unsustainable disparity between water demand and supply pereira et al 2006 while scarcity can be controlled for drought impacts can only be mitigated via climate adaptation mukherjee et al 2018 van loon et al 2016 wmo and gwp 2016 drought development is complex as any change in water fluxes affects multiple feedback processes in the hydrologic cycle van loon 2015 typically drought propagation is conceptualized as a top down hierarchical process where anomalies in precipitation and temperature cascade down to soil moisture hydrologic and socio economic drought usually in a non linear fashion and with significant lag mukherjee et al 2018 and with inevitable negative implications as illustrated in fig 1 due to its creeping nature drought processes impacts and even its definitions are varied and complex van loon 2015 while the underlying physical processes that govern the water cycle follow a fairly straightforward logic the hydrometeorological system as a whole is stochastic or random in its nature forcing us to rely on various statistical methods and parameterizations model simplifications these come with their own uncertainties that must be accounted for in climate change impact assessments fowler et al 2018 garcia et al 2017 teutschbein and seibert 2012 even then assessing the impact of a drought is not a straightforward task as one must establish which threshold defines a drought hence different drought indices have been developed to reduce the complex problem of drought identification and quantification to single numbers a variety of indices have been proposed over the decades to simplify the problem wmo and gwp 2016 these must be chosen appropriately to match the hydrological regime and demands of local water management van loon 2015 most of these indices quantify one aspect of the hydrological cycle e g meteorological soil moisture or hydrological drought in fig 1 but there are also composite indices that span multiple sectors see wmo and gwp 2016 for an exhaustive list as these indices make varying assumptions about climate and catchment properties they exhibit different regional and temporal patterns and must be chosen accordingly hisdal et al 2001 these indices can be classed as either standardized or threshold indices standardized indices are ideal for drought comparison between different regions as the droughts are quantified statistically and normalized but they are not always useful for water management hence in these cases threshold indices are often used instead as they rank drought severity based on an established threshold level for hydrological variables van loon 2015 for the assessment of future drought severity the chosen indices must also be robust and account for changing climates they also should distinguish water scarcity from drought which becomes a separate issue with growing populations and water demand mukherjee et al 2018 in our water dependent society droughts can affect a multitude of sectors both public and private with impacts developing slowly over time mishra and singh 2010 impacts can be both direct and indirect blauhut et al 2016 when droughts affect key sectors of society such as agriculture forestry water supply energy production ecosystem services and human health undrr 2019 their economic impacts are among the highest of natural hazards kim et al 2015 but their intangible effects on human health and the environment are often underestimated undrr 2019 during droughts competing water demands between these sectors can create potential conflicts with their prominence often being correlated to the severity of the drought event hisdal and tallaksen 2003 the described impacts and their related challenges are particularly important to be addressed in the context of climate change the earth s surface ocean and tropospheric temperatures have significantly increased over the last century along with more frequent and intense precipitation and drought events and these changes can be directly attributed to anthropogenic warming chiang et al 2021 hari et al 2020 ipcc 2014 as per the clausius clapeyron relationship every degree rise in temperature is associated with a 7 increase in moisture holding capacity of the atmosphere mukherjee et al 2018 thus climate change has had a wide range of impacts on the hydrologic cycle globally including for example changes to regional precipitation patterns cloud cover annual river streamflow flood peak duration shifts flow duration curves magnitude and duration of lowflows glacier and permafrost extent or wildfires these observed changes in hydrologic behavior also had consequences for drought frequency and severity since droughts can have a severe effect on various sectors such as agriculture forestry water supply sanitation energy production navigation and ecosystems it becomes a necessity to provide reliable projections of future change for mitigation and adaptation purposes bakke et al 2020 hakala et al 2019 staudinger et al 2014 zipper et al 2019 be beb in europe drought trends varied greatly depending on region with northern europe having exhibited mostly increasing trends in precipitation gudmundsson and seneviratne 2015 these changes in precipitation manifested themselves in streamflow shifts i e causing less severe low flow conditions in most winter low flow regimes across the northern parts of norway sweden and finland stahl 2001 stahl et al 2010 in a more recent study by teutschbein et al 2022 over a 60 year period an overall wetting trend across sweden was confirmed these patterns are consistent with findings of other studies in comparable climate zones a tendency towards wetter conditions leading to less severe low flow conditions were also found for northern canada asong et al 2018 yang et al 2020 finland korhonen and kuusisto 2010 and norway wilson et al 2010 by the end of this century 2071 2100 increases in land surface temperatures are expected to exceed the 1 5 2 c threshold meanwhile annual and summer precipitation is expected to increase in northern europe and decrease in southern europe ipcc 2021 both variables control the water cycle precipitation as a direct component of the water cycle and temperature as a proxy for energy availability which plays a key role in estimating evapotranspiration as well as snow accumulation and melt both of which exert influence on the amount and timing of streamflow because both mean temperatures and total precipitation are increasing in northern europe the exact future development of drought remains uncertain and unexplored indicating a need for regional studies to explore this knowledge gap the future development of droughts in sweden has so far only been explored as part of large scale pan european studies e g spinoni et al 2018 or roudier et al 2016 which are often not robust as they typically only include a few large river basins in each country and sometimes even point towards different directions understanding how societies respond to droughts or indeed climate change in general is one of the major uncertainties in current climate projections van loon et al 2016 as such it is prudent that we take time understanding how risk assessment and management work at all levels of society in sweden knowledge about risk management and planning as well as funding for preventative measures is provided at the national level by institutes of hydrology geotechnology and urban planning while actual management is delegated to municipalities at a local level municipalities are supervised and directed by regional county administrative boards who provide advice and data regional and local actors are thus responsible for data and implementing most of the climate mitigation and adaptation practices while also judging their appropriateness storbj√∂rk 2007 local actors thus play an important role in building infrastructure and resources to mitigate drought impacts from this we can deduce that more localized predictions of drought patterns are required to motivate these actors into action at this level the type of drought becomes important as one area may primarily consist of forestry and other industries requiring predictions on fire hazards streamflow droughts etc whereas another area may be more urbanized requiring predictions that impact water supply and agriculture for example almost half of sweden s electricity generation comes from hydropower swedish energy agency 2022 which is generated mostly in northern sweden meanwhile urbanized areas such as stockholm gothenburg or malm√∂ reside mostly southward and toward the coastlines fig 2 hence different types of drought are important in different parts of the country and for different sectors in particular the water energy and food sectors help fulfill many of society s demands for products and services and they are increasingly recognized as being interconnected in a complex and mutually interacting system hereafter referred to as the water energy food wef nexus while challenges concerning natural resources management including water resources management have predominantly been managed by sectors so called silos in the past van den heuvel et al 2020 this silo approach often failed to capture the complexity of the nexus there is in fact growing evidence of plentiful interlinkages between the water energy and food sectors that should be considered fao 2014 for instance water supply uses energy hydropower alters river flows and ecosystem functioning and the production and distribution of fertilizer consumes energy while its application on farmland damages ecosystems in cities water and energy are intimately connected and heavily used furthermore food production agriculture involves irrigation that consumes water and requires energy for pumping the nexus approach is a rather novel way to address and analyze these complex interlinkages within the nexus with the aim to promote synergies and identify tradeoffs between sectors albrecht et al 2018 while initially two sector nexus concepts e g water food or water energy have been presented endo et al 2017 ringler et al 2013 current state of the art research also considers more complex nexus systems that include climate and land use change van den heuvel et al 2020 or ecosystems h√ºlsmann et al 2019 the scientific community particularly agrees on the need for a better integration of the ecosystem perspective in the nexus concept bidoglio et al 2019 since ecosystems deliver the resources and services needed to sustain human activity and thus are key players for reaching the sustainable development goals sdgs therefore we here consider that water energy food and ecosystems form a complex wefe nexus in sweden with various interlinkages fig 1 in recent years several wef frameworks models techniques and tools proliferated to understand identify or reproduce the intrinsic wefe sector links purwanto 2021 while numerous studies adopt the nexus as a conceptual framework albrecht et al 2018 and provide sector specific descriptions of water energy food and ecosystems that aid in understanding the nexus dai et al 2018 implementation and modeling studies that address multiple links and feedback mechanisms are extremely diverse with the modeling itself heavily reliant on location time spatiotemporal scale and target group su≈°nik and staddon 2021 as a result of the diverse demands and requirements of nexus studies several tools and techniques that attempt to quantify the representation and interactions between sectors emerged albrecht et al 2018 dai et al 2018 su≈°nik and staddon 2021 including 1 system dynamics modeling sdm 2 multi region input output modeling mrio 3 agent based modeling abm 4 life cycle assessment lca and 5 integrated assessment modeling iam su≈°nik and staddon 2021 argue that only sdm and iam can coherently address the holistic nexus and its inter sectoral dynamics complexities and feedback loops shifts in the wefe nexus are driven by changes in hydroclimatic e g temperature precipitation environmental e g land cover or socio economic e g population growth economic development conditions thus hydrological extremes such as droughts and their alterations in a future climate are critical as they can severely impact a multitude of interlinkages within the wefe nexus efficient resources management within the wefe nexus thus requires robust assessments of past and reliable projections of future drought impacts to help inform decision makers in communal water energy food and ecosystem related sectors however studies that systematically and holistically assess drought impacts on the wefe nexus e g utilizing sdm or iam are extremely rare a few examples include those conducted by sridhar et al 2021 and kang et al 2021 on the mekong river in china zhao et al 2021 on the yakima river basin in the united states and wicaksono et al 2019 on a case study in the republic of korea different types of drought in terms of duration frequency severity and intensity affect sectors differently while for example hydro power dams can persevere over short droughts of a few months agricultural activities and municipal water supply may be heavily impacted this is particularly the case in regions highly dependent on surface water supply which has a quicker response to drought than groundwater dependent regions stagge et al 2015 additionally short but intense droughts may be more conducive to fire hazards and heat waves thus posing a bigger risk for public health than prolonged low intensity droughts for these purposes some drought indices can be accumulated over different time scales to address the needs of different sectors for monitoring and prediction drought indices need to be general enough to be widely applicable but also specific enough to identify the type of drought relevant to the region and variable of interest staudinger et al 2014 for this purpose most threshold level indices are insufficient as they are too specific and only applicable to a single catchment thus in this paper we identified a suite of standardized indices to describe different drought types fig 1 center that are deemed relevant for different wefe nexus sectors fig 1 outer rectangle instead of focusing entirely on the water cycle components this paper puts the wefe nexus at the heart of the analysis it builds the foundation for assessing drought propagation across the wefe nexus sectors which is here represented by sectoral response times i e the lag to a precipitation deficit we hypothesize that different characteristics in the wefe nexus lead to large differences in their future drought responses frequency severity and duration by demonstrating how drought conditions change and are propagated through the nexus sectors in sweden in a future climate this paper serves as a foundation for integrated policy making within and outside sweden to optimize synergies and trade offs in the water energy food ecosystem nexus 2 study area a set of 50 high latitude catchments in sweden fig 2a was chosen primarily selected based on data availability i e requiring continuous streamflow measurements for the period january 1961 to december 2020 with gaps up to max 14 days that were filled through linear interpolation a low degree of reservoir regulation and low proportions of glaciers and urban areas table 1 sweden a country in northern europe has an area of nearly 408 000 km2 slu 2015 and features elevation ranges of 2 to 2100 m a s l fig 2a forest covers roughly 69 of the land area while 9 of the area are made up by wetlands and water bodies 8 by shrubs and grass land 8 by agriculture mostly in southern sweden 3 by human settlements urban areas and the remaining 3 are open land and glaciers fig 2b till is the dominant soil class which covers about 75 of the land area according to the k√∂ppen geiger classification beck et al 2018 sweden has a poleward gradient of a warm summer hemiboreal dfb climate zone in the southern regions subarctic boreal dfc climate with cool summers very cold winter persistent seasonal snow cover and soil frost during winters in central and northern sweden and tundra et climate with monthly mean temperatures below 10 c in the scandinavian mountains in northwestern sweden fig 2c most of what today is classified as dfb and dfc zones is projected to transition into cfb and dfb climates respectively by 2070 2100 beck et al 2018 during the period 1961 2020 annual mean temperature in sweden was on average 2 6 c while the annual precipitation averaged 784 mm during this period annual temperature has been significantly rising at a rate of 0 037 c per year at 5 significance level which adds up to a total warming of 2 2 c from 1961 to 2020 at the same time precipitation has been increasing at a significant rate of 2 4 mm per year which corresponds to a total increase of 144 mm or 20 for the same period average annual streamflow showed considerable spatial variations with highest values ranging from 810 to 1300 mm year in the scandinavian mountains in northwestern sweden and lowest values of 168 to 300 mm year in southeastern sweden 3 data 3 1 observed historic data series of daily streamflow measurements were downloaded from a publicly accessible streamflow database https vattenwebb smhi se provided by the swedish meteorological and hydrological institute smhi only catchments with continuous daily streamflow records from january 1961 to december 2020 were included in this study furthermore only catchments with low percentages of lakes glaciers and urbanized areas with a low degree of regulation and without river bifurcations or backwater effects were considered geospatial data for the selected 50 streamflow stations was obtained from smhi s svar database eklund 2011 for each catchment gridded daily mean temperature and daily precipitation were obtained from smhi s pthbv database smhi 2005 which provides a spatially interpolated 4 km 4 km national grid for the period 1961 2020 johansson 2002 an area weighted average of all grid cells partly or fully lying within each catchment s boundary were computed to obtain catchment specific temperature and precipitation values 3 2 future data 3 2 1 climatological data daily temperature and precipitation simulations for a reference control period 1961 2005 and a future scenario period 2006 2100 from ten different climate models cms provided by the coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment cordex initiative jacob et al 2014 were used in this study table 2 the choice of cms was limited to those that had both historic and future temperature and precipitation simulations available until the end of the century 2100 for all three greenhouse gas concentration trajectories i e rcp2 6 4 5 and 8 5 and for the highest available resolution 0 11 roughly 12 5 km if simulations were available in several versions e g v1 and v2 the most recent version i e v2 was used the gridded daily precipitation and temperature simulations were averaged over each catchment to ensure that the subsequent hydrological modelling provided robust and reliable future streamflow simulations ehret et al 2012 muerth et al 2013 teutschbein and seibert 2013 2012 2010 biases i e systematic errors in these climate model simulations were adjusted using the distribution scaling method boe et al 2007 d√©qu√© et al 2007 ines and hansen 2006 to date this is one of the most commonly used and most reliable as well as cost efficient bias adjustment methods teutschbein and seibert 2013 tootoonchi et al 2022a tootoonchi et al 2022b which corrects biases in daily cm simulated temperature and precipitation on a monthly basis distribution scaling matches the theoretical cumulative distribution function cdf of cm simulated data with the observed cdf typically the gamma distribution is used to represent precipitation on wet days while the gaussian distribution is commonly used for temperature preliminary evaluations confirmed the suitability of these two distribution families to represent cm output and were thus employed in this paper because cms tend to simulate too many days with low precipitation i e drizzle a precipitation threshold of 0 1 mm per day was applied to avoid substantial distortions of the distributions for a more detailed mathematical description of the procedure we refer the reader to teutschbein and seibert 2012 3 2 2 future streamflow we utilized the conceptual rainfall runoff model hbv light seibert and vis 2012 to simulate daily streamflow in each of the study catchments hbv light is a lumped model that has been widely used for different basins and climates bergstr√∂m and lindstr√∂m 2015 a detailed description of the model structure and its routines is provided by seibert and vis 2012 as well as seibert and bergstr√∂m 2022 the model takes observations of precipitation p air temperature t and potential evapotranspiration pet as input data and provides various runoff components q of a catchment or multiple sub catchments along with snow depth and actual evapotranspiration aet as outputs as we only had observed temperature and precipitation available daily pet was calculated with the temperature based hamon equation hamon 1968 in each catchment hbv light was calibrated to observed streamflow 1962 1991 with 1961 1962 serving as warm up by optimizing fifty randomly selected parameter sets using 5000 runs of the built in gap optimization algorithm seibert 2000 the best parameter set for each catchment was selected according to a composite objective function that included the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse the logarithmic nse lognse and the volumetric efficiency ve the calibrated models for the 50 catchments were validated based on the observed streamflow from 1991 to 2020 and then used to simulate future daily streamflows in each catchment using the bias adjusted precipitation and temperature simulations provided by the 10 cms the observed flow series was used only for calibration and validation of the hydrological hbv light model 4 methods 4 1 the wefe nexus sectors water energy food and ecosystem services the four nexus sectors water energy food and ecosystem services refer to the provision of essential resources required for the benefit of human well being purwanto 2021 the water sector mainly includes water supply and sanitation in sweden water supply is mostly dependent on surface and groundwater resources teutschbein et al 2022 thus this sector is sensitive to hydrological droughts fig 1 the energy sector revolves around energy security that is based on renewable and non renewable energy resources according to the swedish energy agency 2022 most energy in sweden is supplied through biofuel 28 and nuclear power 27 followed by raw oil and petroleum products 20 hydropower 14 and wind power 6 about 24 of the total energy production is transformed into electricity which strongly depends on hydropower 45 and nuclear power 29 thus droughts influence the energy sector mainly through insufficient streamflow which can limit hydropower production and hamper power plant cooling van vliet et al 2013 the food sector comprises mainly crop and livestock farming in a rainfed agricultural system as is typically the case in northern european countries arable land is most sensitive to meteorological i e precipitation deficit and soil moisture drought the ecosystem services sector includes ecosystems such as forests grasslands agro eco and freshwater ecosystems and the goods and services they provide to support the well being of humans these services are essential to the provision of water energy and food purwanto 2021 and play an integral role in the wefe nexus for this nexus fig 3 no single drought index is appropriate for all sectors hence it is good practice to include several more targeted drought indices in climate change assessments because precipitation and temperature data are often the most widely available many indices use these as input to quantify droughts however to account for climate change suitable indices should also account for the effects of potential evapotranspiration pet marcos garcia et al 2017 mukherjee et al 2018 and other hydrological variables that can impact the total water balance staudinger et al 2014 4 2 standardized drought indices for the wefe nexus the existing spectrum of drought indices can be categorized in multiple ways which differ in their complexity and which are based on either natural boundaries impact sectors input data calibration methods or other characteristics wmo and gwp 2016 based on natural boundaries they can be divided into the typical drought categories meteorological soil moisture and hydrological drought along with composite or modelled indices and indices based on remote sensing data however in this paper we suggest a categorization based on the wefe nexus sectors that they represent this new perspective implies that the drought indices are no longer used to merely judge the drought hazard and the propagation through the hydrological system but instead the focus is shifted towards the impacted sectors thus providing an essential foundation for studying drought propagation through the wefe nexus lens and focusing on impact based drought assessment and forecasting we carefully analyzed the exhaustive list of standardized indices provided by wmo and gwp 2016 and in a first step categorized them based on their suitability to represent wefe nexus sectors as judged by the authors expert knowledge and recommendations found in the literature please note that we only focused on standardized as opposed to threshold based indices as these are more suitable for the comparison across regions sectors and time periods future versus past for each index we also synthesized the data needs in a second step we identified all drought indices that could be easily computed based on the available data which in our case were the measured hydroclimatic variables precipitation p temperature t and streamflow q as well as potential evapotranspiration pet computed with the hamon equation hamon 1968 and various variables simulated by the hbv light model including actual evapotranspiration aet snow water equivalent swe snow melt rate sm soil moisture content smc groundwater recharge gw groundwater storage rd and effective precipitation pe as defined by tigkas et al 2016 based on data availability ease of computation recommendations in the literature and their applicability and relevance for the swedish and northern european wefe nexus one index each was chosen to represent one of the four wefe nexus sectors fig 3 as described further below although not directly linked to a particular nexus sectors we included the standardized precipitation index spi introduced by mckee et al 1993 for a comparison to describe future changes in the input of water the spi relies solely on precipitation and has been a popular index for drought intercomparison projects due to its wide applicability for different spatiotemporal scales it has been endorsed by the world meteorological organization wmo and others as the standard way of quantifying meteorological drought wmo and gwp 2016 the spi provides a dimensionless anomaly from normal situations where positive spi values indicate conditions above normal i e wet conditions while negative values represent below normal conditions i e drought conditions additionally we also included the standardized snowmelt and rain index smri which was developed as a supplementary index to the spi to account for the effects of snow accumulation and snowmelt in cold climates staudinger et al 2014 snow can both mitigate the severity of summer droughts while also intensifying winter droughts the smri follows the same calculation procedure as the spi but is computed from the daily sum of snow melt and rain to obtain the snowmelt we utilized the snow routine in hbv light which only requires temperature and precipitation the multiscalar standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 was selected to characterize droughts in the water sector it is computed identically to the spi but instead standardizes the monthly difference in precipitation and potential evapotranspiration pet herein also referred to as the climatic water balance as such it is more robust with longer aggregation periods e g 12 or more months as it properly accounts for the water balance making it also suitable for the characterization of hydrological droughts the standardized streamflow index ssfi follows the same way of calculations but uses streamflow data vicente serrano et al 2011 and is typically applied to quantify hydrological droughts vicente serrano et al 2012 as such it is here deemed suitable for the energy sector i e availability of enough streamflow for hydropower production and power plant cooling the modified reconnaissance drought index rdie standardizes the effective precipitation pe divided by the pet and thus more accurately represents the amount of precipitation that can be consumed by plants as opposed to being lost to deep percolation tigkas et al 2016 thus we here employ the rdie to identify droughts in the food sector the effective precipitation i e the part of total precipitation that is not intercepted does not runoff at the surface and does not percolate to deeper soil layers was in our study computed from hbv light outputs both the spei and the rdie require an estimation of pet which was obtained using the hamon equation hamon 1968 the normalized ecosystem drought index nedi was specifically designed to reflect ecosystem responses to water stress chang et al 2018 it is very similar to the spei in that it uses the difference between the cumulative monthly precipitation and pet as an indicator variable however unlike the spei the nedi subtracts the total monthly pet from the cumulative precipitation of the preceding month this is done to account for the fact that the water from precipitation is often not immediately available for ecosystems but has to go through a series of hydrological processes before reaching plant roots and providing nutrients for growth please note that each drought index was computed for the entire period 1961 2100 to allow for a comparison of drying or wetting trends across time periods the subsequent analysis of future droughts however only considered the future period 2071 2100 4 3 identification and characterization of droughts droughts are programmatically defined as in spinoni et al 2015 which follows run theory by yevjevich 1967 a drought event is initiated when the drought index e g spi reaches a value below 1 i e becomes more severe than a mild drought the drought then continues as long as the index stays below zero at which point the drought ends this definition determines the duration and frequency of drought to assess the potential cost of droughts to different societal and ecological functions drought severity was also computed as the sum of absolute values in deficits over the duration of that drought note the drought indices are based on monthly averages and drought events shorter than one month may not be resolved unless they are more intense additionally there was no pooling or exclusion of droughts 4 4 projected changes in future droughts per sector projected future 2071 2100 anomalies ensemble mean of all climate models from current conditions were estimated separately for each drought index and each rcp i e 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 all indices were computed for 1 3 6 12 24 and 48 months aggregation periods in addition to overall projected changes seasonal changes were also considered by separately evaluating drought conditions during the warmer spring summer months and the colder autumn winter months to this end we evaluated the 6 month indices for september i e integrating the drought conditions of the warmer 6 months from april to september and for march i e representing drought conditions during the colder months from october to march 4 5 propagation across wefe nexus sectors response times given the existing well known complexity of the wefe nexus there might be large differences in the drought response and resulting drought durations of different sectors to analyze drought responses to precipitation deficits across all different wefe nexus we computed the cross correlation between spi and the four indices spei ssfi rdie and nedi representing the water energy food and ecosystem service sectors respectively we used standard cross correlation as a measure of similarity between the spi series and shifted lagged series of the four sector specific indices as a function of the lag lags of 1 to 24 months were considered we adopted the procedure by bloomfield and marchant 2013 originally outlined for groundwater response times and used the lag time resulting in the highest cross correlation between spi and the sector specific drought indices as proxy for the sector response times lag time is a common metric to characterize drought propagation zhang et al 2022 and was here calculated for past conditions 1961 2005 as well as for future conditions 2071 2100 under rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 a faster response of a sector is hence indicated by a shorter response time of the sector specific index to the spi 5 results 5 1 projected changes in future droughts per sector 5 1 1 general drought trends the chosen drought indices project different degrees of future changes in general drought behavior which depend on the selected rcps fig 4 anomalies projected for the lowest radiative forcing rcp2 6 generally differ a bit from those projected for the more extreme radiative forcings rcp4 5 and 8 5 while the latter two are generally in line but differ in their magnitude of change for rcp2 6 the spi indicates a future wetting in central sweden which implies more precipitation input into the water balance while a drying is projected for the far south western catchments in the dfb climate and the far north eastern catchments along the baltic sea coast fig 4a left for the other two rcps the precipitation is projected to increase across the entire country with a stronger increase for rcp8 5 fig 4a these patterns are generally also visible with the smri fig 4b although here a more pronounced drying is seen in the northern regions compared to the spi the increasing water input is not reflected in the water sector as it is counteracted by increasing energy supply and thus increasing evaporation under rcp2 6 this implies a drying across the entire country except for five catchments in central sweden fig 4c left for the stronger radiative forcings the drying is more pronounced and affects all catchments fig 4c for the energy sector 56 of the catchments are projected to experience lower streamflow levels under rcp2 6 while 44 mainly located in central sweden are projected to become wetter this wetting trend is seen for all catchments across the entire country under rcp4 5 and 8 5 fig 4d for the food sector the signal is not that clear fig 4e under rcp2 6 most catchments in the south and only a few in central and northern sweden are projected to become drier fig 4e left those catchments that are projected to become drier under rcp2 6 are projected to become even more dry under rcp4 5 and 8 5 the other catchments show different responses to a warming climate some are projected to become drier others to become wetter fig 4e for the ecosystem service sector fig 4f the simulations under rcp2 6 show similar conditions as for the water sector i e a drying in the far south and north but the patterns diverge for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 here a wettening is projected instead with only some drying catchments in the far south eastern parts of the country under rcp8 5 5 1 2 seasonal drought changes despite an overall wetting trend in the meteorological conditions fig 4a clear seasonal differences emerged for the warmer spring and summer months from april to september which are characterized by higher vegetational and societal water demand the spi indicates that general water input through precipitation is increasing fig 5 a this wetting trend is projected to be stronger for higher radiative forcings strongest for rcp8 5 for the lowest radiative forcing rcp2 6 this wetting trend can also be seen with the smri in south central catchments fig 5b and translates into all wefe nexus sectors fig 5c f except for a few catchments in southern regions however for the higher radiative forcings the future projections in the nexus sectors diverge from the water input signal i e from the spi the water sector consistently experiences a drying which is particularly severe under rcp8 5 fig 5c the energy sector is projected to be affected by drier conditions especially in northern and western sweden while south eastern regions are getting somewhat wetter fig 5d both the food fig 5e and ecosystem service sectors fig 5f follow a similar pattern as the water sector with a drying across the entire country with only very few exceptions in central sweden which is much stronger under rcp8 5 the strongest worsening of drought conditions in the range of 0 4 to 0 6 standard deviations is projected for the water fig 5c and food sectors fig 5e for the colder autumn and winter months the projected drying trends were weaker and the signals show somewhat different future developments fig 6 for the lowest radiative forcing rcp2 6 both the spi fig 6a and the smri fig 6b indicate a drying trend with less precipitation across the entire country with a few exceptions in central sweden fig 6a this pattern is however not reproduced with rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 which both show an increase in water input across the entire country these future developments are generally projected for all four nexus sectors fig 6c f in particular for the water fig 6c and ecosystem service sectors fig 6f which closely follow the patterns of spi and smri for rcp2 6 the energy fig 6d and food sectors fig 6e also demonstrate a drying in the southern regions under rcp2 6 but several regions in the north western parts of sweden feature a wetting fig 6d e despite lower inputs fig 6a b the food sector also sticks out as few catchments in the north west and some in the south are projected to undergo a substantial drying under rcp8 5 fig 6f 5 1 3 projected changes in drought characteristics the projected changes in drought frequency duration and severity over the 21st century are not consistent across all 50 catchments and are also incoherent across the four nexus sectors and across the rcps fig 7 for the water sector fig 7a c a clear majority of catchments 82 98 is projected to have a higher drought frequency in the future fig 7a ranging from a median of 0 3 more drought events per decade max 1 0 under rcp2 6 to 0 9 more drought events per decade max 1 9 under rcp8 5 at the same time under rcp2 6 only 40 of the catchments are projected to experience longer drought durations in the future fig 7b while under stronger forcing most catchments i e 72 78 are projected to suffer from longer droughts on average 0 75 months longer max 3 2 months under rcp4 5 and 0 4 months longer max 2 5 under rcp8 5 these trends are also reflected in the projected severity fig 7c which gets worse for the majority of catchments under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 the energy sector fig 7d f shows the opposite signal the majority of catchments is projected to have fewer drought events fig 7d of shorter duration fig 7e and lower severity fig 7f in a future climate the signal is consistent across all three forcings but represents different levels of changes with rcp2 6 showing the smallest and rcp8 5 the largest anomalies in a future climate both the food fig 7g i and ecosystem services sectors fig 7j l show similar future projections as the water sector with a clear increase in drought frequency a prolongation of drought events and more severe droughts especially under rcp4 5 5 2 drought propagation across the nexus sectors the computation of sectoral response times to the precipitation deficits as indicated by the spi revealed differences in the timing of droughts among the four wefe nexus sectors fig 8 a while both the water spei and ecosystem service sectors nedi showed a relatively quick response within the same month of the precipitation deficit signal under past conditions the food sector rdie had the second quickest response on average 0 1 months followed by the energy sector ssfi with 1 6 months fig 8a for the energy sector response times are projected to decrease to 1 5 1 4 or 1 2 months in a future climate depending on the rcp while only small and inconsistent changes are projected for the food and ecosystems sector similarly the duration of drought events in each sector also varied in the past fig 8b the energy sector featured the longest drought durations 8 9 months followed by the water sector 6 7 months the ecosystem sector 6 6 months and the food sector 6 3 months in a future climate these drought durations are projected to increase for all sectors except for the energy sector fig 8b 6 discussion using an ensemble of 10 climate models in combination with the hydrological hbv light model this paper provides projections of a variety of distinguished drought indices that represent the four sectors water energy food and ecosystem services these sectors are intrinsically connected within the complex wefe nexus our results suggest that the total water input to the water balance in the form of precipitation will increase in a future climate especially under stronger climate forcings however droughts are affected by a number of hydrological processes that are influenced by global warming wu et al 2022 thus the spi alone is not informative enough for all wefe nexus sectors and energy sensitive hydrological processes such as evaporation snow rain partitioning snow accumulation and snowmelt should not be neglected as they will strongly influence the seasonal availability of water for example including a snowmelt component as suggested by staudinger et al 2014 mostly influences the drought projections for the spring and summer months in northern sweden where seasonal snowmelt patterns are expected to shift in a future climate additionally we here show that the evaporation sensitive indices generally project more frequent longer and more severe droughts which is relevant for the water food and ecosystem sectors this trend is particularly pronounced in the spring and summer months which emphasizes that the evaporative demand and longer growing season in these months will outweigh the water surplus provided by precipitation and will be further exacerbated by a lack of spring and summer snowmelt in northern regions this is particularly true for the water food and ecosystem services sectors for the food sector the change signal in a future climate is not consistent especially in central and northern sweden some catchments are projected to feature wetter and other catchments drier conditions for agriculture these findings have implications for agricultural management especially for ditching draining the landscape and irrigation watering the landscape thus more research is needed to understand the underlying causes and potential links to catchments properties and local hydrological processes the energy sector which in sweden mostly relates to the production of hydropower and availability of streamflow for cooling purposes seems to be an exception among all four studied nexus sectors here a transition of catchments in central and northern sweden from snow melt dominated to rainfall driven streamflow regimes provides a seasonally more balanced availability of water which is expected to be mostly beneficial in a changing climate van vliet et al 2013 these findings corroborate turner et al 2017 who also projected benefits for scandinavian hydropower production in the 21st century it is however important to also consider the spatial distribution and local clustering of particular sectors for instance in sweden most of the hydropower is produced in northern regions where catchments are especially sensitive to warming temperatures and shifts in snow dynamics in contrast arable land and most of the agriculture are predominantly located in southern sweden which are regions prone to increasing evaporation rates as well as water demands by humans consumption and vegetation the water supply and ecosystem services sectors are spread across the entire country but here it might also be worth to consider population distributions as densely populated areas suffer from higher pressures on the available water resources henrichs and alcamo 2001 based on the results in this paper certain inferences can be made about the chronology of emerging drought events and their propagation through the wefe nexus the water sector has the shortest response time to deficits in precipitation which is closely followed by the food and ecosystem sectors the energy sector sticks out as having one of the longest response times and thus taking substantially longer time to exhibit drought impacts at the same time droughts in the energy sector seem to last longer than in the other sectors the selection of tailored drought indices in this paper is beneficial for identifying and characterizing drought properties within each sector and for providing projections for how these sectors are expected to evolve with time over the 21st century throughout sweden in addition to those employed in this study other standardized indices might also be appropriate to represent particular sectors for example the standardized soil moisture index leeper et al 2021 may be used to characterize the food sector whereas the standardized reservoir supply index shiau 2003 may be helpful to represent the energy or water supply sector other types such as palmer based indices palmer 1965 which are based on simple water balance models or multivariate drought indices rajsekhar et al 2015 might also be suitable in such a context for the ecosystem service sector the nedi was in this study particularly chosen as it was specifically developed to represent the water availability for plants chang et al 2018 soleimani motlagh et al 2022 however one of its key limitations is that it is a meteorological drought index and does not necessarily reflect vegetative stress other indices such as streamflow normalized by environmental flow for freshwater ecosystems tharme 2003 or the leaf area index for terrestrial ecosystems lawal et al 2022 might be more suitable to represent ecosystem health and should be tested in future wefe nexus studies while the traditional selection of standardized drought indices is typically guided by research needs data and tools we argue that a careful selection of indices in combination with modeling approaches can help shaping policy decisions for instance we here see clear cross sectoral temporal winter versus summer spatial cross catchment and cross pathway rcp differences that have severe consequences for decision making at local and national scale spring and summer months are projected to be more affected in a future climate which will exacerbate already existing water stress during these warmer months of the year ahopelto et al 2019 this might potentially intensify the already competing interests of water users within the wefe nexus madani 2010 which in combination with population growth and increasing consumption fl√∂rke et al 2018 could lead to severe water shortages throughout the summer kummu et al 2016 this calls for relevant policies e g swedish or european drought directive or economic instruments to assist water allocation and management regulation of potential conflicts rey et al 2019 wimmer et al 2015 especially during the warmer spring and summer months likewise catchments in southern sweden which are generally more densely populated and thus are affected by greater water withdrawals are projected to suffer from more severe drought conditions in the future especially in relation to the water food and ecosystem services sectors only for the energy sector wetting trends prevail in southern regions located in the dfb climate which are characterized by little or no snow accumulation during winter and which are entirely affected by increasing rainfall amounts however the majority of hydropower production is located in northern sweden a region which today is characterized by snow accumulation during winter and a snowmelt in spring or early summer here a drying trend can be seen until the end of the century in the energy sector due to the diminishing snow layers and earlier spring flood peaks in a warming climate teutschbein et al 2015 which has implications on hydro dam operation strategies in a future climate our results also suggest that drought occurrence and severity will only marginally change under the lowest rcp2 6 thus keeping greenhouse emissions at a minimum is essential for reaching the agenda 2030 sustainable development goals un general assembly 2015 and for guaranteeing properly functioning hydrological and catchment processes 7 conclusions we analyzed various drought indices relevant for the water energy food and ecosystem sectors over the 21st century in sweden using bias corrected climate model data driven by different greenhouse gas trajectories in combination with hydrological modelling outputs for an ensemble of 50 catchments indices were chosen according to sector suitability data availability and ease of use and were then analyzed for trends and correlations at different time scales these trends were then used to predict impacts to different sectors within the wefe nexus thus our new approach implies that drought indices are no longer used to merely judge the drought hazard and the propagation through the hydrological system instead there is a need to shift the view towards the impacted sectors thus providing an essential foundation for studying drought propagation through the wefe nexus lens and focusing on impact based drought assessment and forecasting different patterns in the response of the four nexus sectors water energy food and ecosystem services to future climate change emerged with different response times and drought durations across the four sectors in particular the warmer spring and summer months are projected to be subject to more severe frequent and long lasting droughts across all four nexus sectors in a future climate these changes are more pronounced for stronger radiative forcings rcp4 5 or rcp8 5 consequently our results offer new insights into the propagation of droughts through the wefe nexus this also provides a promising basis for further research on the representativeness of other potentially suitable drought indices for the water energy food and ecosystem service sectors we finally argue that future drought projections can be better geared towards decision makers by basing them on standardized drought indices that are specifically tailored to represent specific nexus sectors credit

2539,droughts can affect a multitude of public and private sectors with impacts developing slowly over time while droughts are traditionally quantified in relation to the hydrological components of the water cycle that they affect this manuscript demonstrates a novel approach to assess future drought conditions through the lens of the water energy food ecosystem wefe nexus concept to this end a set of standardized drought indices specifically designed to represent different nexus sectors across 50 catchments in sweden was computed based on an ensemble of past and future climate model simulations different patterns in the response of the four nexus sectors water energy food and ecosystem services to future climate change emerged with different response times and drought durations across the sectors these results offer new insights into the propagation of drought through the wefe nexus in cold climates they further suggest that future drought projections can be better geared

is freely available in public databases hosted by the swedish meteorological and hydrological institute relevant references and links are provided in the paper 1 introduction despite affecting every continent having vast socio economic and environmental impacts droughts often elude headlines this is partially due to their slow onsets long durations and recovery times which make it difficult to predict and quantify their impacts rajsekhar et al 2015 spinoni et al 2015 droughts are usually characterized by their severity locality duration and timing the term drought is distinct from water scarcity in that drought is an episodic socio climatologically induced water deficit caused by an anomaly in average conditions whereas water scarcity is a long term unsustainable disparity between water demand and supply pereira et al 2006 while scarcity can be controlled for drought impacts can only be mitigated via climate adaptation mukherjee et al 2018 van loon et al 2016 wmo and gwp 2016 drought development is complex as any change in water fluxes affects multiple feedback processes in the hydrologic cycle van loon 2015 typically drought propagation is conceptualized as a top down hierarchical process where anomalies in precipitation and temperature cascade down to soil moisture hydrologic and socio economic drought usually in a non linear fashion and with significant lag mukherjee et al 2018 and with inevitable negative implications as illustrated in fig 1 due to its creeping nature drought processes impacts and even its definitions are varied and complex van loon 2015 while the underlying physical processes that govern the water cycle follow a fairly straightforward logic the hydrometeorological system as a whole is stochastic or random in its nature forcing us to rely on various statistical methods and parameterizations model simplifications these come with their own uncertainties that must be accounted for in climate change impact assessments fowler et al 2018 garcia et al 2017 teutschbein and seibert 2012 even then assessing the impact of a drought is not a straightforward task as one must establish which threshold defines a drought hence different drought indices have been developed to reduce the complex problem of drought identification and quantification to single numbers a variety of indices have been proposed over the decades to simplify the problem wmo and gwp 2016 these must be chosen appropriately to match the hydrological regime and demands of local water management van loon 2015 most of these indices quantify one aspect of the hydrological cycle e g meteorological soil moisture or hydrological drought in fig 1 but there are also composite indices that span multiple sectors see wmo and gwp 2016 for an exhaustive list as these indices make varying assumptions about climate and catchment properties they exhibit different regional and temporal patterns and must be chosen accordingly hisdal et al 2001 these indices can be classed as either standardized or threshold indices standardized indices are ideal for drought comparison between different regions as the droughts are quantified statistically and normalized but they are not always useful for water management hence in these cases threshold indices are often used instead as they rank drought severity based on an established threshold level for hydrological variables van loon 2015 for the assessment of future drought severity the chosen indices must also be robust and account for changing climates they also should distinguish water scarcity from drought which becomes a separate issue with growing populations and water demand mukherjee et al 2018 in our water dependent society droughts can affect a multitude of sectors both public and private with impacts developing slowly over time mishra and singh 2010 impacts can be both direct and indirect blauhut et al 2016 when droughts affect key sectors of society such as agriculture forestry water supply energy production ecosystem services and human health undrr 2019 their economic impacts are among the highest of natural hazards kim et al 2015 but their intangible effects on human health and the environment are often underestimated undrr 2019 during droughts competing water demands between these sectors can create potential conflicts with their prominence often being correlated to the severity of the drought event hisdal and tallaksen 2003 the described impacts and their related challenges are particularly important to be addressed in the context of climate change the earth s surface ocean and tropospheric temperatures have significantly increased over the last century along with more frequent and intense precipitation and drought events and these changes can be directly attributed to anthropogenic warming chiang et al 2021 hari et al 2020 ipcc 2014 as per the clausius clapeyron relationship every degree rise in temperature is associated with a 7 increase in moisture holding capacity of the atmosphere mukherjee et al 2018 thus climate change has had a wide range of impacts on the hydrologic cycle globally including for example changes to regional precipitation patterns cloud cover annual river streamflow flood peak duration shifts flow duration curves magnitude and duration of lowflows glacier and permafrost extent or wildfires these observed changes in hydrologic behavior also had consequences for drought frequency and severity since droughts can have a severe effect on various sectors such as agriculture forestry water supply sanitation energy production navigation and ecosystems it becomes a necessity to provide reliable projections of future change for mitigation and adaptation purposes bakke et al 2020 hakala et al 2019 staudinger et al 2014 zipper et al 2019 be beb in europe drought trends varied greatly depending on region with northern europe having exhibited mostly increasing trends in precipitation gudmundsson and seneviratne 2015 these changes in precipitation manifested themselves in streamflow shifts i e causing less severe low flow conditions in most winter low flow regimes across the northern parts of norway sweden and finland stahl 2001 stahl et al 2010 in a more recent study by teutschbein et al 2022 over a 60 year period an overall wetting trend across sweden was confirmed these patterns are consistent with findings of other studies in comparable climate zones a tendency towards wetter conditions leading to less severe low flow conditions were also found for northern canada asong et al 2018 yang et al 2020 finland korhonen and kuusisto 2010 and norway wilson et al 2010 by the end of this century 2071 2100 increases in land surface temperatures are expected to exceed the 1 5 2 c threshold meanwhile annual and summer precipitation is expected to increase in northern europe and decrease in southern europe ipcc 2021 both variables control the water cycle precipitation as a direct component of the water cycle and temperature as a proxy for energy availability which plays a key role in estimating evapotranspiration as well as snow accumulation and melt both of which exert influence on the amount and timing of streamflow because both mean temperatures and total precipitation are increasing in northern europe the exact future development of drought remains uncertain and unexplored indicating a need for regional studies to explore this knowledge gap the future development of droughts in sweden has so far only been explored as part of large scale pan european studies e g spinoni et al 2018 or roudier et al 2016 which are often not robust as they typically only include a few large river basins in each country and sometimes even point towards different directions understanding how societies respond to droughts or indeed climate change in general is one of the major uncertainties in current climate projections van loon et al 2016 as such it is prudent that we take time understanding how risk assessment and management work at all levels of society in sweden knowledge about risk management and planning as well as funding for preventative measures is provided at the national level by institutes of hydrology geotechnology and urban planning while actual management is delegated to municipalities at a local level municipalities are supervised and directed by regional county administrative boards who provide advice and data regional and local actors are thus responsible for data and implementing most of the climate mitigation and adaptation practices while also judging their appropriateness storbj√∂rk 2007 local actors thus play an important role in building infrastructure and resources to mitigate drought impacts from this we can deduce that more localized predictions of drought patterns are required to motivate these actors into action at this level the type of drought becomes important as one area may primarily consist of forestry and other industries requiring predictions on fire hazards streamflow droughts etc whereas another area may be more urbanized requiring predictions that impact water supply and agriculture for example almost half of sweden s electricity generation comes from hydropower swedish energy agency 2022 which is generated mostly in northern sweden meanwhile urbanized areas such as stockholm gothenburg or malm√∂ reside mostly southward and toward the coastlines fig 2 hence different types of drought are important in different parts of the country and for different sectors in particular the water energy and food sectors help fulfill many of society s demands for products and services and they are increasingly recognized as being interconnected in a complex and mutually interacting system hereafter referred to as the water energy food wef nexus while challenges concerning natural resources management including water resources management have predominantly been managed by sectors so called silos in the past van den heuvel et al 2020 this silo approach often failed to capture the complexity of the nexus there is in fact growing evidence of plentiful interlinkages between the water energy and food sectors that should be considered fao 2014 for instance water supply uses energy hydropower alters river flows and ecosystem functioning and the production and distribution of fertilizer consumes energy while its application on farmland damages ecosystems in cities water and energy are intimately connected and heavily used furthermore food production agriculture involves irrigation that consumes water and requires energy for pumping the nexus approach is a rather novel way to address and analyze these complex interlinkages within the nexus with the aim to promote synergies and identify tradeoffs between sectors albrecht et al 2018 while initially two sector nexus concepts e g water food or water energy have been presented endo et al 2017 ringler et al 2013 current state of the art research also considers more complex nexus systems that include climate and land use change van den heuvel et al 2020 or ecosystems h√ºlsmann et al 2019 the scientific community particularly agrees on the need for a better integration of the ecosystem perspective in the nexus concept bidoglio et al 2019 since ecosystems deliver the resources and services needed to sustain human activity and thus are key players for reaching the sustainable development goals sdgs therefore we here consider that water energy food and ecosystems form a complex wefe nexus in sweden with various interlinkages fig 1 in recent years several wef frameworks models techniques and tools proliferated to understand identify or reproduce the intrinsic wefe sector links purwanto 2021 while numerous studies adopt the nexus as a conceptual framework albrecht et al 2018 and provide sector specific descriptions of water energy food and ecosystems that aid in understanding the nexus dai et al 2018 implementation and modeling studies that address multiple links and feedback mechanisms are extremely diverse with the modeling itself heavily reliant on location time spatiotemporal scale and target group su≈°nik and staddon 2021 as a result of the diverse demands and requirements of nexus studies several tools and techniques that attempt to quantify the representation and interactions between sectors emerged albrecht et al 2018 dai et al 2018 su≈°nik and staddon 2021 including 1 system dynamics modeling sdm 2 multi region input output modeling mrio 3 agent based modeling abm 4 life cycle assessment lca and 5 integrated assessment modeling iam su≈°nik and staddon 2021 argue that only sdm and iam can coherently address the holistic nexus and its inter sectoral dynamics complexities and feedback loops shifts in the wefe nexus are driven by changes in hydroclimatic e g temperature precipitation environmental e g land cover or socio economic e g population growth economic development conditions thus hydrological extremes such as droughts and their alterations in a future climate are critical as they can severely impact a multitude of interlinkages within the wefe nexus efficient resources management within the wefe nexus thus requires robust assessments of past and reliable projections of future drought impacts to help inform decision makers in communal water energy food and ecosystem related sectors however studies that systematically and holistically assess drought impacts on the wefe nexus e g utilizing sdm or iam are extremely rare a few examples include those conducted by sridhar et al 2021 and kang et al 2021 on the mekong river in china zhao et al 2021 on the yakima river basin in the united states and wicaksono et al 2019 on a case study in the republic of korea different types of drought in terms of duration frequency severity and intensity affect sectors differently while for example hydro power dams can persevere over short droughts of a few months agricultural activities and municipal water supply may be heavily impacted this is particularly the case in regions highly dependent on surface water supply which has a quicker response to drought than groundwater dependent regions stagge et al 2015 additionally short but intense droughts may be more conducive to fire hazards and heat waves thus posing a bigger risk for public health than prolonged low intensity droughts for these purposes some drought indices can be accumulated over different time scales to address the needs of different sectors for monitoring and prediction drought indices need to be general enough to be widely applicable but also specific enough to identify the type of drought relevant to the region and variable of interest staudinger et al 2014 for this purpose most threshold level indices are insufficient as they are too specific and only applicable to a single catchment thus in this paper we identified a suite of standardized indices to describe different drought types fig 1 center that are deemed relevant for different wefe nexus sectors fig 1 outer rectangle instead of focusing entirely on the water cycle components this paper puts the wefe nexus at the heart of the analysis it builds the foundation for assessing drought propagation across the wefe nexus sectors which is here represented by sectoral response times i e the lag to a precipitation deficit we hypothesize that different characteristics in the wefe nexus lead to large differences in their future drought responses frequency severity and duration by demonstrating how drought conditions change and are propagated through the nexus sectors in sweden in a future climate this paper serves as a foundation for integrated policy making within and outside sweden to optimize synergies and trade offs in the water energy food ecosystem nexus 2 study area a set of 50 high latitude catchments in sweden fig 2a was chosen primarily selected based on data availability i e requiring continuous streamflow measurements for the period january 1961 to december 2020 with gaps up to max 14 days that were filled through linear interpolation a low degree of reservoir regulation and low proportions of glaciers and urban areas table 1 sweden a country in northern europe has an area of nearly 408 000 km2 slu 2015 and features elevation ranges of 2 to 2100 m a s l fig 2a forest covers roughly 69 of the land area while 9 of the area are made up by wetlands and water bodies 8 by shrubs and grass land 8 by agriculture mostly in southern sweden 3 by human settlements urban areas and the remaining 3 are open land and glaciers fig 2b till is the dominant soil class which covers about 75 of the land area according to the k√∂ppen geiger classification beck et al 2018 sweden has a poleward gradient of a warm summer hemiboreal dfb climate zone in the southern regions subarctic boreal dfc climate with cool summers very cold winter persistent seasonal snow cover and soil frost during winters in central and northern sweden and tundra et climate with monthly mean temperatures below 10 c in the scandinavian mountains in northwestern sweden fig 2c most of what today is classified as dfb and dfc zones is projected to transition into cfb and dfb climates respectively by 2070 2100 beck et al 2018 during the period 1961 2020 annual mean temperature in sweden was on average 2 6 c while the annual precipitation averaged 784 mm during this period annual temperature has been significantly rising at a rate of 0 037 c per year at 5 significance level which adds up to a total warming of 2 2 c from 1961 to 2020 at the same time precipitation has been increasing at a significant rate of 2 4 mm per year which corresponds to a total increase of 144 mm or 20 for the same period average annual streamflow showed considerable spatial variations with highest values ranging from 810 to 1300 mm year in the scandinavian mountains in northwestern sweden and lowest values of 168 to 300 mm year in southeastern sweden 3 data 3 1 observed historic data series of daily streamflow measurements were downloaded from a publicly accessible streamflow database https vattenwebb smhi se provided by the swedish meteorological and hydrological institute smhi only catchments with continuous daily streamflow records from january 1961 to december 2020 were included in this study furthermore only catchments with low percentages of lakes glaciers and urbanized areas with a low degree of regulation and without river bifurcations or backwater effects were considered geospatial data for the selected 50 streamflow stations was obtained from smhi s svar database eklund 2011 for each catchment gridded daily mean temperature and daily precipitation were obtained from smhi s pthbv database smhi 2005 which provides a spatially interpolated 4 km 4 km national grid for the period 1961 2020 johansson 2002 an area weighted average of all grid cells partly or fully lying within each catchment s boundary were computed to obtain catchment specific temperature and precipitation values 3 2 future data 3 2 1 climatological data daily temperature and precipitation simulations for a reference control period 1961 2005 and a future scenario period 2006 2100 from ten different climate models cms provided by the coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment cordex initiative jacob et al 2014 were used in this study table 2 the choice of cms was limited to those that had both historic and future temperature and precipitation simulations available until the end of the century 2100 for all three greenhouse gas concentration trajectories i e rcp2 6 4 5 and 8 5 and for the highest available resolution 0 11 roughly 12 5 km if simulations were available in several versions e g v1 and v2 the most recent version i e v2 was used the gridded daily precipitation and temperature simulations were averaged over each catchment to ensure that the subsequent hydrological modelling provided robust and reliable future streamflow simulations ehret et al 2012 muerth et al 2013 teutschbein and seibert 2013 2012 2010 biases i e systematic errors in these climate model simulations were adjusted using the distribution scaling method boe et al 2007 d√©qu√© et al 2007 ines and hansen 2006 to date this is one of the most commonly used and most reliable as well as cost efficient bias adjustment methods teutschbein and seibert 2013 tootoonchi et al 2022a tootoonchi et al 2022b which corrects biases in daily cm simulated temperature and precipitation on a monthly basis distribution scaling matches the theoretical cumulative distribution function cdf of cm simulated data with the observed cdf typically the gamma distribution is used to represent precipitation on wet days while the gaussian distribution is commonly used for temperature preliminary evaluations confirmed the suitability of these two distribution families to represent cm output and were thus employed in this paper because cms tend to simulate too many days with low precipitation i e drizzle a precipitation threshold of 0 1 mm per day was applied to avoid substantial distortions of the distributions for a more detailed mathematical description of the procedure we refer the reader to teutschbein and seibert 2012 3 2 2 future streamflow we utilized the conceptual rainfall runoff model hbv light seibert and vis 2012 to simulate daily streamflow in each of the study catchments hbv light is a lumped model that has been widely used for different basins and climates bergstr√∂m and lindstr√∂m 2015 a detailed description of the model structure and its routines is provided by seibert and vis 2012 as well as seibert and bergstr√∂m 2022 the model takes observations of precipitation p air temperature t and potential evapotranspiration pet as input data and provides various runoff components q of a catchment or multiple sub catchments along with snow depth and actual evapotranspiration aet as outputs as we only had observed temperature and precipitation available daily pet was calculated with the temperature based hamon equation hamon 1968 in each catchment hbv light was calibrated to observed streamflow 1962 1991 with 1961 1962 serving as warm up by optimizing fifty randomly selected parameter sets using 5000 runs of the built in gap optimization algorithm seibert 2000 the best parameter set for each catchment was selected according to a composite objective function that included the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse the logarithmic nse lognse and the volumetric efficiency ve the calibrated models for the 50 catchments were validated based on the observed streamflow from 1991 to 2020 and then used to simulate future daily streamflows in each catchment using the bias adjusted precipitation and temperature simulations provided by the 10 cms the observed flow series was used only for calibration and validation of the hydrological hbv light model 4 methods 4 1 the wefe nexus sectors water energy food and ecosystem services the four nexus sectors water energy food and ecosystem services refer to the provision of essential resources required for the benefit of human well being purwanto 2021 the water sector mainly includes water supply and sanitation in sweden water supply is mostly dependent on surface and groundwater resources teutschbein et al 2022 thus this sector is sensitive to hydrological droughts fig 1 the energy sector revolves around energy security that is based on renewable and non renewable energy resources according to the swedish energy agency 2022 most energy in sweden is supplied through biofuel 28 and nuclear power 27 followed by raw oil and petroleum products 20 hydropower 14 and wind power 6 about 24 of the total energy production is transformed into electricity which strongly depends on hydropower 45 and nuclear power 29 thus droughts influence the energy sector mainly through insufficient streamflow which can limit hydropower production and hamper power plant cooling van vliet et al 2013 the food sector comprises mainly crop and livestock farming in a rainfed agricultural system as is typically the case in northern european countries arable land is most sensitive to meteorological i e precipitation deficit and soil moisture drought the ecosystem services sector includes ecosystems such as forests grasslands agro eco and freshwater ecosystems and the goods and services they provide to support the well being of humans these services are essential to the provision of water energy and food purwanto 2021 and play an integral role in the wefe nexus for this nexus fig 3 no single drought index is appropriate for all sectors hence it is good practice to include several more targeted drought indices in climate change assessments because precipitation and temperature data are often the most widely available many indices use these as input to quantify droughts however to account for climate change suitable indices should also account for the effects of potential evapotranspiration pet marcos garcia et al 2017 mukherjee et al 2018 and other hydrological variables that can impact the total water balance staudinger et al 2014 4 2 standardized drought indices for the wefe nexus the existing spectrum of drought indices can be categorized in multiple ways which differ in their complexity and which are based on either natural boundaries impact sectors input data calibration methods or other characteristics wmo and gwp 2016 based on natural boundaries they can be divided into the typical drought categories meteorological soil moisture and hydrological drought along with composite or modelled indices and indices based on remote sensing data however in this paper we suggest a categorization based on the wefe nexus sectors that they represent this new perspective implies that the drought indices are no longer used to merely judge the drought hazard and the propagation through the hydrological system but instead the focus is shifted towards the impacted sectors thus providing an essential foundation for studying drought propagation through the wefe nexus lens and focusing on impact based drought assessment and forecasting we carefully analyzed the exhaustive list of standardized indices provided by wmo and gwp 2016 and in a first step categorized them based on their suitability to represent wefe nexus sectors as judged by the authors expert knowledge and recommendations found in the literature please note that we only focused on standardized as opposed to threshold based indices as these are more suitable for the comparison across regions sectors and time periods future versus past for each index we also synthesized the data needs in a second step we identified all drought indices that could be easily computed based on the available data which in our case were the measured hydroclimatic variables precipitation p temperature t and streamflow q as well as potential evapotranspiration pet computed with the hamon equation hamon 1968 and various variables simulated by the hbv light model including actual evapotranspiration aet snow water equivalent swe snow melt rate sm soil moisture content smc groundwater recharge gw groundwater storage rd and effective precipitation pe as defined by tigkas et al 2016 based on data availability ease of computation recommendations in the literature and their applicability and relevance for the swedish and northern european wefe nexus one index each was chosen to represent one of the four wefe nexus sectors fig 3 as described further below although not directly linked to a particular nexus sectors we included the standardized precipitation index spi introduced by mckee et al 1993 for a comparison to describe future changes in the input of water the spi relies solely on precipitation and has been a popular index for drought intercomparison projects due to its wide applicability for different spatiotemporal scales it has been endorsed by the world meteorological organization wmo and others as the standard way of quantifying meteorological drought wmo and gwp 2016 the spi provides a dimensionless anomaly from normal situations where positive spi values indicate conditions above normal i e wet conditions while negative values represent below normal conditions i e drought conditions additionally we also included the standardized snowmelt and rain index smri which was developed as a supplementary index to the spi to account for the effects of snow accumulation and snowmelt in cold climates staudinger et al 2014 snow can both mitigate the severity of summer droughts while also intensifying winter droughts the smri follows the same calculation procedure as the spi but is computed from the daily sum of snow melt and rain to obtain the snowmelt we utilized the snow routine in hbv light which only requires temperature and precipitation the multiscalar standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 was selected to characterize droughts in the water sector it is computed identically to the spi but instead standardizes the monthly difference in precipitation and potential evapotranspiration pet herein also referred to as the climatic water balance as such it is more robust with longer aggregation periods e g 12 or more months as it properly accounts for the water balance making it also suitable for the characterization of hydrological droughts the standardized streamflow index ssfi follows the same way of calculations but uses streamflow data vicente serrano et al 2011 and is typically applied to quantify hydrological droughts vicente serrano et al 2012 as such it is here deemed suitable for the energy sector i e availability of enough streamflow for hydropower production and power plant cooling the modified reconnaissance drought index rdie standardizes the effective precipitation pe divided by the pet and thus more accurately represents the amount of precipitation that can be consumed by plants as opposed to being lost to deep percolation tigkas et al 2016 thus we here employ the rdie to identify droughts in the food sector the effective precipitation i e the part of total precipitation that is not intercepted does not runoff at the surface and does not percolate to deeper soil layers was in our study computed from hbv light outputs both the spei and the rdie require an estimation of pet which was obtained using the hamon equation hamon 1968 the normalized ecosystem drought index nedi was specifically designed to reflect ecosystem responses to water stress chang et al 2018 it is very similar to the spei in that it uses the difference between the cumulative monthly precipitation and pet as an indicator variable however unlike the spei the nedi subtracts the total monthly pet from the cumulative precipitation of the preceding month this is done to account for the fact that the water from precipitation is often not immediately available for ecosystems but has to go through a series of hydrological processes before reaching plant roots and providing nutrients for growth please note that each drought index was computed for the entire period 1961 2100 to allow for a comparison of drying or wetting trends across time periods the subsequent analysis of future droughts however only considered the future period 2071 2100 4 3 identification and characterization of droughts droughts are programmatically defined as in spinoni et al 2015 which follows run theory by yevjevich 1967 a drought event is initiated when the drought index e g spi reaches a value below 1 i e becomes more severe than a mild drought the drought then continues as long as the index stays below zero at which point the drought ends this definition determines the duration and frequency of drought to assess the potential cost of droughts to different societal and ecological functions drought severity was also computed as the sum of absolute values in deficits over the duration of that drought note the drought indices are based on monthly averages and drought events shorter than one month may not be resolved unless they are more intense additionally there was no pooling or exclusion of droughts 4 4 projected changes in future droughts per sector projected future 2071 2100 anomalies ensemble mean of all climate models from current conditions were estimated separately for each drought index and each rcp i e 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 all indices were computed for 1 3 6 12 24 and 48 months aggregation periods in addition to overall projected changes seasonal changes were also considered by separately evaluating drought conditions during the warmer spring summer months and the colder autumn winter months to this end we evaluated the 6 month indices for september i e integrating the drought conditions of the warmer 6 months from april to september and for march i e representing drought conditions during the colder months from october to march 4 5 propagation across wefe nexus sectors response times given the existing well known complexity of the wefe nexus there might be large differences in the drought response and resulting drought durations of different sectors to analyze drought responses to precipitation deficits across all different wefe nexus we computed the cross correlation between spi and the four indices spei ssfi rdie and nedi representing the water energy food and ecosystem service sectors respectively we used standard cross correlation as a measure of similarity between the spi series and shifted lagged series of the four sector specific indices as a function of the lag lags of 1 to 24 months were considered we adopted the procedure by bloomfield and marchant 2013 originally outlined for groundwater response times and used the lag time resulting in the highest cross correlation between spi and the sector specific drought indices as proxy for the sector response times lag time is a common metric to characterize drought propagation zhang et al 2022 and was here calculated for past conditions 1961 2005 as well as for future conditions 2071 2100 under rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 a faster response of a sector is hence indicated by a shorter response time of the sector specific index to the spi 5 results 5 1 projected changes in future droughts per sector 5 1 1 general drought trends the chosen drought indices project different degrees of future changes in general drought behavior which depend on the selected rcps fig 4 anomalies projected for the lowest radiative forcing rcp2 6 generally differ a bit from those projected for the more extreme radiative forcings rcp4 5 and 8 5 while the latter two are generally in line but differ in their magnitude of change for rcp2 6 the spi indicates a future wetting in central sweden which implies more precipitation input into the water balance while a drying is projected for the far south western catchments in the dfb climate and the far north eastern catchments along the baltic sea coast fig 4a left for the other two rcps the precipitation is projected to increase across the entire country with a stronger increase for rcp8 5 fig 4a these patterns are generally also visible with the smri fig 4b although here a more pronounced drying is seen in the northern regions compared to the spi the increasing water input is not reflected in the water sector as it is counteracted by increasing energy supply and thus increasing evaporation under rcp2 6 this implies a drying across the entire country except for five catchments in central sweden fig 4c left for the stronger radiative forcings the drying is more pronounced and affects all catchments fig 4c for the energy sector 56 of the catchments are projected to experience lower streamflow levels under rcp2 6 while 44 mainly located in central sweden are projected to become wetter this wetting trend is seen for all catchments across the entire country under rcp4 5 and 8 5 fig 4d for the food sector the signal is not that clear fig 4e under rcp2 6 most catchments in the south and only a few in central and northern sweden are projected to become drier fig 4e left those catchments that are projected to become drier under rcp2 6 are projected to become even more dry under rcp4 5 and 8 5 the other catchments show different responses to a warming climate some are projected to become drier others to become wetter fig 4e for the ecosystem service sector fig 4f the simulations under rcp2 6 show similar conditions as for the water sector i e a drying in the far south and north but the patterns diverge for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 here a wettening is projected instead with only some drying catchments in the far south eastern parts of the country under rcp8 5 5 1 2 seasonal drought changes despite an overall wetting trend in the meteorological conditions fig 4a clear seasonal differences emerged for the warmer spring and summer months from april to september which are characterized by higher vegetational and societal water demand the spi indicates that general water input through precipitation is increasing fig 5 a this wetting trend is projected to be stronger for higher radiative forcings strongest for rcp8 5 for the lowest radiative forcing rcp2 6 this wetting trend can also be seen with the smri in south central catchments fig 5b and translates into all wefe nexus sectors fig 5c f except for a few catchments in southern regions however for the higher radiative forcings the future projections in the nexus sectors diverge from the water input signal i e from the spi the water sector consistently experiences a drying which is particularly severe under rcp8 5 fig 5c the energy sector is projected to be affected by drier conditions especially in northern and western sweden while south eastern regions are getting somewhat wetter fig 5d both the food fig 5e and ecosystem service sectors fig 5f follow a similar pattern as the water sector with a drying across the entire country with only very few exceptions in central sweden which is much stronger under rcp8 5 the strongest worsening of drought conditions in the range of 0 4 to 0 6 standard deviations is projected for the water fig 5c and food sectors fig 5e for the colder autumn and winter months the projected drying trends were weaker and the signals show somewhat different future developments fig 6 for the lowest radiative forcing rcp2 6 both the spi fig 6a and the smri fig 6b indicate a drying trend with less precipitation across the entire country with a few exceptions in central sweden fig 6a this pattern is however not reproduced with rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 which both show an increase in water input across the entire country these future developments are generally projected for all four nexus sectors fig 6c f in particular for the water fig 6c and ecosystem service sectors fig 6f which closely follow the patterns of spi and smri for rcp2 6 the energy fig 6d and food sectors fig 6e also demonstrate a drying in the southern regions under rcp2 6 but several regions in the north western parts of sweden feature a wetting fig 6d e despite lower inputs fig 6a b the food sector also sticks out as few catchments in the north west and some in the south are projected to undergo a substantial drying under rcp8 5 fig 6f 5 1 3 projected changes in drought characteristics the projected changes in drought frequency duration and severity over the 21st century are not consistent across all 50 catchments and are also incoherent across the four nexus sectors and across the rcps fig 7 for the water sector fig 7a c a clear majority of catchments 82 98 is projected to have a higher drought frequency in the future fig 7a ranging from a median of 0 3 more drought events per decade max 1 0 under rcp2 6 to 0 9 more drought events per decade max 1 9 under rcp8 5 at the same time under rcp2 6 only 40 of the catchments are projected to experience longer drought durations in the future fig 7b while under stronger forcing most catchments i e 72 78 are projected to suffer from longer droughts on average 0 75 months longer max 3 2 months under rcp4 5 and 0 4 months longer max 2 5 under rcp8 5 these trends are also reflected in the projected severity fig 7c which gets worse for the majority of catchments under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 the energy sector fig 7d f shows the opposite signal the majority of catchments is projected to have fewer drought events fig 7d of shorter duration fig 7e and lower severity fig 7f in a future climate the signal is consistent across all three forcings but represents different levels of changes with rcp2 6 showing the smallest and rcp8 5 the largest anomalies in a future climate both the food fig 7g i and ecosystem services sectors fig 7j l show similar future projections as the water sector with a clear increase in drought frequency a prolongation of drought events and more severe droughts especially under rcp4 5 5 2 drought propagation across the nexus sectors the computation of sectoral response times to the precipitation deficits as indicated by the spi revealed differences in the timing of droughts among the four wefe nexus sectors fig 8 a while both the water spei and ecosystem service sectors nedi showed a relatively quick response within the same month of the precipitation deficit signal under past conditions the food sector rdie had the second quickest response on average 0 1 months followed by the energy sector ssfi with 1 6 months fig 8a for the energy sector response times are projected to decrease to 1 5 1 4 or 1 2 months in a future climate depending on the rcp while only small and inconsistent changes are projected for the food and ecosystems sector similarly the duration of drought events in each sector also varied in the past fig 8b the energy sector featured the longest drought durations 8 9 months followed by the water sector 6 7 months the ecosystem sector 6 6 months and the food sector 6 3 months in a future climate these drought durations are projected to increase for all sectors except for the energy sector fig 8b 6 discussion using an ensemble of 10 climate models in combination with the hydrological hbv light model this paper provides projections of a variety of distinguished drought indices that represent the four sectors water energy food and ecosystem services these sectors are intrinsically connected within the complex wefe nexus our results suggest that the total water input to the water balance in the form of precipitation will increase in a future climate especially under stronger climate forcings however droughts are affected by a number of hydrological processes that are influenced by global warming wu et al 2022 thus the spi alone is not informative enough for all wefe nexus sectors and energy sensitive hydrological processes such as evaporation snow rain partitioning snow accumulation and snowmelt should not be neglected as they will strongly influence the seasonal availability of water for example including a snowmelt component as suggested by staudinger et al 2014 mostly influences the drought projections for the spring and summer months in northern sweden where seasonal snowmelt patterns are expected to shift in a future climate additionally we here show that the evaporation sensitive indices generally project more frequent longer and more severe droughts which is relevant for the water food and ecosystem sectors this trend is particularly pronounced in the spring and summer months which emphasizes that the evaporative demand and longer growing season in these months will outweigh the water surplus provided by precipitation and will be further exacerbated by a lack of spring and summer snowmelt in northern regions this is particularly true for the water food and ecosystem services sectors for the food sector the change signal in a future climate is not consistent especially in central and northern sweden some catchments are projected to feature wetter and other catchments drier conditions for agriculture these findings have implications for agricultural management especially for ditching draining the landscape and irrigation watering the landscape thus more research is needed to understand the underlying causes and potential links to catchments properties and local hydrological processes the energy sector which in sweden mostly relates to the production of hydropower and availability of streamflow for cooling purposes seems to be an exception among all four studied nexus sectors here a transition of catchments in central and northern sweden from snow melt dominated to rainfall driven streamflow regimes provides a seasonally more balanced availability of water which is expected to be mostly beneficial in a changing climate van vliet et al 2013 these findings corroborate turner et al 2017 who also projected benefits for scandinavian hydropower production in the 21st century it is however important to also consider the spatial distribution and local clustering of particular sectors for instance in sweden most of the hydropower is produced in northern regions where catchments are especially sensitive to warming temperatures and shifts in snow dynamics in contrast arable land and most of the agriculture are predominantly located in southern sweden which are regions prone to increasing evaporation rates as well as water demands by humans consumption and vegetation the water supply and ecosystem services sectors are spread across the entire country but here it might also be worth to consider population distributions as densely populated areas suffer from higher pressures on the available water resources henrichs and alcamo 2001 based on the results in this paper certain inferences can be made about the chronology of emerging drought events and their propagation through the wefe nexus the water sector has the shortest response time to deficits in precipitation which is closely followed by the food and ecosystem sectors the energy sector sticks out as having one of the longest response times and thus taking substantially longer time to exhibit drought impacts at the same time droughts in the energy sector seem to last longer than in the other sectors the selection of tailored drought indices in this paper is beneficial for identifying and characterizing drought properties within each sector and for providing projections for how these sectors are expected to evolve with time over the 21st century throughout sweden in addition to those employed in this study other standardized indices might also be appropriate to represent particular sectors for example the standardized soil moisture index leeper et al 2021 may be used to characterize the food sector whereas the standardized reservoir supply index shiau 2003 may be helpful to represent the energy or water supply sector other types such as palmer based indices palmer 1965 which are based on simple water balance models or multivariate drought indices rajsekhar et al 2015 might also be suitable in such a context for the ecosystem service sector the nedi was in this study particularly chosen as it was specifically developed to represent the water availability for plants chang et al 2018 soleimani motlagh et al 2022 however one of its key limitations is that it is a meteorological drought index and does not necessarily reflect vegetative stress other indices such as streamflow normalized by environmental flow for freshwater ecosystems tharme 2003 or the leaf area index for terrestrial ecosystems lawal et al 2022 might be more suitable to represent ecosystem health and should be tested in future wefe nexus studies while the traditional selection of standardized drought indices is typically guided by research needs data and tools we argue that a careful selection of indices in combination with modeling approaches can help shaping policy decisions for instance we here see clear cross sectoral temporal winter versus summer spatial cross catchment and cross pathway rcp differences that have severe consequences for decision making at local and national scale spring and summer months are projected to be more affected in a future climate which will exacerbate already existing water stress during these warmer months of the year ahopelto et al 2019 this might potentially intensify the already competing interests of water users within the wefe nexus madani 2010 which in combination with population growth and increasing consumption fl√∂rke et al 2018 could lead to severe water shortages throughout the summer kummu et al 2016 this calls for relevant policies e g swedish or european drought directive or economic instruments to assist water allocation and management regulation of potential conflicts rey et al 2019 wimmer et al 2015 especially during the warmer spring and summer months likewise catchments in southern sweden which are generally more densely populated and thus are affected by greater water withdrawals are projected to suffer from more severe drought conditions in the future especially in relation to the water food and ecosystem services sectors only for the energy sector wetting trends prevail in southern regions located in the dfb climate which are characterized by little or no snow accumulation during winter and which are entirely affected by increasing rainfall amounts however the majority of hydropower production is located in northern sweden a region which today is characterized by snow accumulation during winter and a snowmelt in spring or early summer here a drying trend can be seen until the end of the century in the energy sector due to the diminishing snow layers and earlier spring flood peaks in a warming climate teutschbein et al 2015 which has implications on hydro dam operation strategies in a future climate our results also suggest that drought occurrence and severity will only marginally change under the lowest rcp2 6 thus keeping greenhouse emissions at a minimum is essential for reaching the agenda 2030 sustainable development goals un general assembly 2015 and for guaranteeing properly functioning hydrological and catchment processes 7 conclusions we analyzed various drought indices relevant for the water energy food and ecosystem sectors over the 21st century in sweden using bias corrected climate model data driven by different greenhouse gas trajectories in combination with hydrological modelling outputs for an ensemble of 50 catchments indices were chosen according to sector suitability data availability and ease of use and were then analyzed for trends and correlations at different time scales these trends were then used to predict impacts to different sectors within the wefe nexus thus our new approach implies that drought indices are no longer used to merely judge the drought hazard and the propagation through the hydrological system instead there is a need to shift the view towards the impacted sectors thus providing an essential foundation for studying drought propagation through the wefe nexus lens and focusing on impact based drought assessment and forecasting different patterns in the response of the four nexus sectors water energy food and ecosystem services to future climate change emerged with different response times and drought durations across the four sectors in particular the warmer spring and summer months are projected to be subject to more severe frequent and long lasting droughts across all four nexus sectors in a future climate these changes are more pronounced for stronger radiative forcings rcp4 5 or rcp8 5 consequently our results offer new insights into the propagation of droughts through the wefe nexus this also provides a promising basis for further research on the representativeness of other potentially suitable drought indices for the water energy food and ecosystem service sectors we finally argue that future drought projections can be better geared towards decision makers by basing them on standardized drought indices that are specifically tailored to represent specific nexus sectors credit
