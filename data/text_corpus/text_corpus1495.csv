7475,the study is based on a complex and unique data set of water stable isotopes i e δ18o and δ2h radon 222 activities i e 222rn and groundwater levels to better understand the interaction of fresh groundwater and recirculated seawater in a snowmelt affected subterranean estuary ste in a boreal region îles de la madeleine qc canada by using a combination of hydrogeological and marine geochemical approaches the objective was to analyze and quantify submarine groundwater discharge processes through a boreal beach after the snow melt period in early june the distribution of δ18o and δ2h in beach groundwater showed that inland fresh groundwater contributed between 97 and 30 of water masses presented within the ste a time series of water table levels during the 16 days of the study indicated that tides propagated as a dynamic wave limiting the mass displacement of seawater within the ste this up and down movement of the water table 10 30 cm induced the vertical infiltration of seawater at the falling tide at the front of the beach a radon based mass balance calculated with high resolution 222rn survey estimated total sgd of 3 1 m3 m d at the discharge zone and a mean flow to 1 5 m3 m d in the bay the nearshore discharge agreed relatively well with darcy fluxes calculated at the beach face fresh groundwater makes up more than 50 of the total discharge during the measuring campaign these results indicate that beaches in boreal and cold regions could be important sources of freshwater originate and groundwater borne solutes and contaminants to the marine environment after the snowmelt keywords stable isotopes of water radon 222 222rn water table level submarine groundwater discharge beach aquifer boreal and cold region 1 introduction submarine groundwater discharge sgd is widely recognized as a significant transport pathway for chemicals entering the coastal ocean li et al 1999 moore 2010 robinson et al 2007 this is particularly important where rapidly growing coastal populations induce complex changes in landscapes and ecosystems as well as increased pressure on coastal water resources in locations around the world deterioration in coastal water quality e g bacterial proliferation harmful algal blooms hypoxia acidification fish and shellfish mortality have been attributed to changes in the quality and volume of groundwater discharged to the ocean hwang et al 2010 valiela et al 1990 the intertidal and nearshore zones of sandy beaches play key roles in the connection across the coastal continuum from watershed to coast heiss and michael 2014 robinson et al 2007 moore 1999 coined the term subterranean estuary ste for the beach aquifer to emphasize the importance of freshwater and seawater mixing and water rock interactions as fresh groundwater transits toward the sea similarly to surficial estuaries solute concentrations change greatly in the dispersion zone of the subterranean estuary beck et al 2015 their chemical behaviors within the ste are complex and closely tied to the subsurface salinity distribution multiple physical forces drive subsurface flow and residence times and thus control the reaction rates and transformations in this biogeochemically active zone cable and martin 2008 michael et al 2005 robinson et al 2007 santos et al 2012 identified at least 12 independent drivers that include both terrestrial e g hydraulic gradient seasonal oscillation of the water table and marine e g wave and tidal pumping ripple and bed form migration bioirrigation processes that interact in complex ways these processes force flow across the water sediment interface albeit under different spatial and temporal scales and consequently influence the export of groundwater borne recirculated and newly formed compounds to the sea thus an in depth understanding of the hydrological sgd processes is necessary to accurately predict chemical fluxes to coastal environments the nearshore area of the beach aquifer is a dynamic zone where fresh groundwater exits the subterranean system through a narrow discharge zone often bounded by two saline zones at the seaward boundary below the discharge zone the saltwater wedge is a fresh groundwater seawater interface induced by a density gradient where dispersion dominates the exchanges the nearshore location of this interface moves on a seasonal scale michael et al 2005 in relation to the hydraulic pressure and density difference between fresh and seawater at the landward boundary above the discharge zone of fresh groundwater tides and waves drive seawater into the beach aquifer forming an upper surficial recirculation cell where advection is the primary process by which solutes move across the sediment water interface the resulting hydraulic gradient generates downward and seaward circulations of seawater to the nearshore aquifer which forms a seawater freshwater mixing zone where dispersion dominates the chemical processes abarca et al 2013 heiss and michael 2014 ullman et al 2003 xin et al 2010 many recent studies on groundwater dynamics in beaches employed groundwater models based on salinity and sometimes on water level measurements abarca et al 2013 evans and wilson 2017 heiss and michael 2014 heiss et al 2014 robinson et al 2007 xin et al 2010 these investigations have all highlighted the necessity to obtain integrated in situ measurements of sgd in specific sites to characterize the nearshore groundwater dynamics in boreal and cold regions the water table elevation is high after snow melt i e in early june inducing in the inland aquifer a strong horizontal head gradient perpendicular to the shore and high darcy flows to the coastal embayment chaillou et al 2016 however these cold regions are still rarely considered as sgd sources a more detailed knowledge of groundwater discharge and particularly of fresh groundwater is critical to the determination of regional and global mass fluxes to coastal zones such quantification is particularly crucial in the north where the hydrology is changing rapidly and is expected to continuously change in response to climate warming adam et al 2009 the aim of this study was to combine hydrogeological and geochemical in situ measurements to analyze sgd processes in a snowmelt affected ste settled in the îles de la madeleine an archipelago located in the southeastern of the gulf of st lawrence the study relied on a time series analysis of hydraulic heads measured along a shore perpendicular transect of multilevel sampling wells to examine the effect of tidal oscillation on the mixing zone the spatial and temporal distribution of radon 222 222rn an effective proxy of short term processes t1 2 3 8d at the groundwater surface water interface burnett et al 2001 and stable isotopes of water δ18o and δ2h were also examined to characterize the fresh groundwater dynamics and to estimate the magnitude of fresh groundwater discharge to the bay after the snowmelt in early june according to our knowledge this study presents the first in depth analyses of nearshore groundwater dynamics influenced by the snowmelt in a boreal sandy beach 2 materials and methods 2 1 hydrological context of the study area this study was conducted in the subterranean estuary at martinique beach on îles de la madeleine in the province of québec canada fig 1 the hydrogeological context of the îles de la madeleine has been presented by comte and banton 2007 the main aquifer of the archipelago is composed of sandstones from the permian inferior period the cap aux meules formation brisebois 1981 with a mean transmissivity of 1 5 4 10 3 m2 s and a mean recharge of 230 mm y i e 25 30 of the annual precipitation madelin eau 2004 groundwater flows through the unconfined permian sandstone aquifer and discharges to the sea both directly and through the overlying quaternary deposits martinique beach originates from a recent transgression sequence the rapid rates of sea level rise along the atlantic coasts of canada over the middle to late holocene buried the unconfined permian sandstone aquifer that is now covered by tidal sediments these buried environments are geological evidence of local and regional submergences over the last millennia scott et al 1995 sediment cores collected on martinique beach were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy sem coupled to an energy dispersive x ray spectrometer and revealed that the quaternary sediment of the beach are 300 μm and mainly composed of silicate mixed with small amount of silt 5 the underlying sandstone aquifer is composed of fine red orange sands 100 μm composed of silicate and aluminosilicate chaillou et al 2014 its localization in the beach and its offshore extent is unknown the site experiences little wave action except during storm events tides are semi diurnal with a spring tide range 1 m previous studies on groundwater discharge and biogeochemistry of the superficial ste have been conducted at this site chaillou et al 2016 chaillou et al 2014 couturier et al 2016 the shallow superficial unconfined beach aquifer releases both fresh groundwater and recirculated seawater to the coastal embayment within the beach fresh groundwater flows towards the seaward discharge region below a narrow intruding saline circulation cell located near the top of intertidal sediments in spring 2013 chaillou et al 2016 used mean regional and local water table levels to estimate groundwater flows ranging from 0 02 m d in the sandstone permian aquifer to 0 30 m d at the beach face 2 2 field measurements 2 2 1 water table levels and hydrogeological properties three piezometers equipped with pressure sensors were installed in a 45 m transect of the study site perpendicular to the beach front figs 1c and 2 the first piezometer was located at the mean low tide mark p3 the second one was located in the intertidal area 10 m further inland p13 and the third was located on the beach terrace 43 m from p3 p44 fig 2 the piezometers were made from 38 mm id pvc pipes sealed at the base and equipped with 0 4 m long screens at the bottom end at every location piezometers extended 1 50 m below the beach surface so that the bottom end would always be below the water table automated level loggers hobo u20 001 recorded groundwater levels every 10 mins from 20 may 2013 to 7 june 2013 16 days time series were corrected for barometric pressure from a barologger located at the study site a permanent government of canada sea level station cap aux meules cam station 1970 http tides gc ca was used as a reference the station is located at 5 km from the study site fig 1b this station recorded water levels every three minutes during the sampling period guelph permeameter measurements n 15 provided a mean hydraulic conductivity of 11 4 4 4 m d in the unsaturated surficial sands 2 2 2 stable isotopes of water and physicochemical parameters of groundwater groundwater was sampled for salinity 222rn and stable isotopes of water at high 27 31 may 2013 and low 3 june 2013 tides a 20 m cross shore transect of multi level samplers m1 7 fig 2 was set up in the intertidal zone where beach groundwater and recirculating seawater most likely discharge the multi level samplers consisted of 2 5 m pvc pipes with eight ports connected to flexible tygon tubing as described in martin et al 2003 multi level samplers were designed to collect water at 10 30 50 80 110 150 190 and 230 cm below the beach surface beach groundwater was pumped with a peristaltic pump into an in line flow cell where specific conductivity spcond dissolved oxygen saturation do temperature and ph were monitored using a calibrated multiparametric probe 600qs ysi inc after stabilization of physicochemical parameters groundwater was collected in 30 ml scintillation vials for water isotope analysis the radon approach is described in the next section groundwater end member samples were collected in the manner described above from private and municipal water wells pp and pm respectively located 50 and 2000 m inshore of the cross shore transect fig 1b c private wells were purged before the sampling seawater end member samples were collected approximately 50 cm below the seawater surface using a submersible pump about 900 m offshore in martinique bay stable isotopes of water δ18o δ2h are used as conservative tracers of mixing processes to investigate and quantify meteoric groundwater seawater interaction since seawater and meteoric groundwater have unique and distinct end member signatures povinec et al 2012 schiavo et al 2009 stable isotopes of water δ18o and δ2h were analyzed by ea irms at the geotop uqam laboratory accuracies are 0 05 at the 1σ level and 1 at the 1σ level for δ18o and δ2h respectively isotopic analyses are reported compared to the international vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow as defined by gonfiantini 1978 reference materials were used throughout the isotopic water analyses to ensure high quality data 2 2 3 222rn measurements 2 2 3 1 high resolution 222rn survey in the bay radon was used as a geochemical tracer to estimate total submarine groundwater discharge into the bay 222rn is an effective qualitative and quantitative tracer because groundwater concentrations are typically higher than those in coastal seawater regardless of fluid origin or composition it mixes conservatively once introduced to seawater a high resolution spatial survey of 222rn was performed on 29 may 2013 over 12 h to identify the general distribution of rn in the bay surface area 0 6 km 0 3 km 0 180 km2 and to quantify total sgd after the snow melt 222rn activity was measured according to dulaiova et al 2005 by a radon in air detector connected to an air water exchanger showerhead type exchanger rad aqua durridge from a small boat water was continuously collected from a submersible pump at 50 cm below the boat and injected into the spray chamber at a rate of 3 l min 1 the water depth was continuously recorded by a dualbeam sonar 200 khz and 83 khz with and gps chartplotting after 20 min of preliminary air water equilibration in the middle of the bay 0 7 km from the shoreline the equilibrated air was continuously pumped through drierite desiccant to the rad7 radon detector the rad7 estimates 222rn activity by measuring the decay of the radioactive daughters 218po and 214po as described by burnett et al 2010 here the 222rn activity was measured over 10 min of count integration as the boat moved slowly 1 2 km h the radon activity of each run was associated with a gps trace mean water depth and mean physicochemical parameters spcond t do continuously recorded sampling period 1 min by a calibrated automatic multiparametric probe fixed near the submersible pump this produced 28 segments in the 0 180 km2 studied area that are represented by 28 points positioned at the middle of the gps segments temperature and humidity were monitored continuously during experiments and served to automatically correct radon in water activities using the capture software from durridge analytical uncertainties based on counting statistics are approximately 48 2σ 2 2 3 2 222rn measurements in inland and beach groundwater fresh groundwater end members were also analyzed using an in situ radon in water approach similar to that described above a submersible pump was lowered into municipal and private wells and water was continuously injected into the spray chamber after 20 min of air water equilibration the 222rn activities were analyzed over four 10 min runs radon in water measures were automatically corrected using temperature and humidity the analytical uncertainty was approximately 15 2σ each 222rn activity was associated with measurements of spcond t do and ph measured by a mutliparametric probe fixed on the pump a second survey of 222rn activities in the fresh groundwater end members was also performed in june 2015 at that time discrete water samples were collected in 2l plastic bottles that were tightly sealed the water was bubbled to allow 222rn degassing in the bottle s 30 ml head space rad h2o durridge as with the rad aqua technique the equilibrated air flows through drierite desiccant to the radon in air detector rad7 durridge and is then re injected into the bottle s head space to close the loop the air volume of the closed loop and water volume of the bottle are known and constant over the measurement and they are independent of flow rate the air recirculates through the water and continuously extracts the radon until a state of equilibrium develops radon in water activities were corrected using temperature and humidity measurements finally 222rn activity was corrected for the initial radon decay that took place between sampling and analysis analytical uncertainties were less than 12 2σ efforts were also made to measure 222rn activities in beach groundwater to obtain an accurate estimate of radon groundwater end member additional 222rn measurements were performed in june 2015 at the m3 and m7 multi level samplers at this period water was collected in 2l sample bottles that were tightly sealed and analyses were performed as described above table 1 gives a summary of the different measurements of rn performed for the study 2 3 mineral bound 226ra activity the 226ra activity of sediments was determined using samples collected from surficial holocene inshore and offshore sediment and in the underlying permian sandstone aquifer using a hand auger thirteen sediment samples were collected from the surface to 1 5 m depth these measurements were done as a first attempt of the activity of 226ra supported 222rn in beach groundwater sediment samples were dried crushed and sealed in vials fitted for a high purity germanium gamma ray spectrometer ortec dspec jr 2 0 they were left in sealed vials for at least 23 days to ensure radioactive re equilibration between the 226ra and the short lived daughters of the 238u series zielinski et al 2001 counting time was fixed at 3 4 days to provide adequate counts for the peaks of interest 226ra counts were based on the measurement of 214pb using the 295 2 and 352 kev and 214bi 609 kev peaks the counting error is 10 disintegrations per minutes dpm g were converted in bq m3 of wet sediment the diffusive production of 222rn from the sediments underlying the bay were calculated using the relation proposed by burnett and dulaiova 2003 as follow 1 1 j diff 0 495 226 ra 0 303 where 226ra is the activity of the sediment bq kg 2 4 analyses of water table levels cross correlation time lag and tidal harmonic analysis tidal propagation in ste has often been studied by combining darcy s law either with analytical solutions elgar 1999 li et al 1999 using cross correlation analysis rotzoll and el kadi 2008 or using numerical models abarca et al 2013 robinson et al 2007 here the intensity of the relationship and the time lag of the whole time series were determined by cross correlating water levels from the ocean and unconfined beach aquifer in addition each time series was analyzed by a time frequency analysis and compared to a theoretical tide signal using a classical tidal harmonic analysis the tidal signal may be decomposed into 17 constituents including five major ones that contribute to approximately 95 of the signal the diurnal harmonic components and their frequencies h 1 are o1 0 03873 and k1 0 04178 while the semidiurnal components are m2 0 08051 s2 0 08333 and m3 0 12076 correlations between time series and purely tide induced oscillations as well as the amplitude of each tidal constituent were estimated to better understand the tidal propagation throughout the beach time series analyses were performed with rstudio using the applied statistical time series analysis stata package baum 2004 and tidal harmonic analyses were performed with matlab 2 5 quantification of sgd 2 5 1 222rn water column mass balance sgd estimations in martinique bay were based on a steady state 222rn derived mass balance model proposed by burnett et al 2008 assuming a steady state for the 12 h integration period i e one complete tidal cycle the mass balance model incorporates sources of 222rn input flux σ f in balanced by losses output flux σ f out the excess of 222rn is attributed to the total groundwater input f gw as follows 2 f gw σ f in σ f out where 3 σ f in f in f riv f diff f resup f prod 4 σ f out f out f decay f atm the excess input flux of 222rn is the sum of martinique bay input f in due to local circulation i e currents and tides river input friv chemical diffusion from underlying sediment fdiff due to 1 production of resuspended sediment fresup and internal production in the water column fprod output flux integrates the loss of excess 222rn by natural radioactive decay in the water column fdecay the loss to the atmosphere fatm and the flux that leaves the box f out due to local water circulation i e currents and tides here surficial input from rivers f riv is not relevant in the calculations since there is no surficial water flow in the study area in addition 222rn growth from 226ra decay in the water column f prod is not considered because it is often assumed to be limited or null in tidal environments see peterson et al 2010 based on the continuous measurements of t spcond and 222rn in the bay a multivariate statistical approach was applied to determine sample clusters where radon and physicochemical parameters could be assumed as homogeneous regardless the tide cycle and the location this method often used in hydrogeochemistry studies is a quantitative and independent approach for classifying and grouping water samples in this study a hierarchical cluster analysis hca was applied a k means clustering determined the exact number of clusters to extract from the database a plot of the within group sum of squares by the number of clusters extracted revealed that only two clusters accurately classified the dataset the subsequent hca analysis revealed that each of the clusters was also composed of two subgroups of samples which corresponded to the samples collected at falling and rising tide respectively steady state water column mass balance of excess 222rn was then applied for each cluster assuming that for a given water column depth and surface area the 222rn inventory is in steady state sgd were quantified in each cluster calculating the different input and output fluxes i e eqs 2 4 as described in details in baudron et al 2015 and modified from dulaiova et al 2010 and smith and swarzenski 2012 tidal currents induce tracer exchanges between the different cluster f in in eq 3 and f out in eq 4 and offshore seawater tide acts as both a source and a loss of 222rn in the water column mass balance no data are available on long shore and tidal currents in the martinique bay as a first approximation long shore current is assumed to be limited in this small study area and only tides are included in the model the input output volume of water induced by tide is assumed to be equal this volume is estimated based on a tidal range of 0 8 m during the sampling period the mean distance between the high and low tide marks of 30 m and the width of the studied zone of 300 m this represented a water volume of 56 700 m3 that transits in the seaward direction during ebb tide exporting 222rn enriched water and an equal volume of seawater that flows landward at flood tide with 222rn poor seawater therefore the net flux was a combination of these exchanges 3 results and discussion 3 1 fresh inland groundwater distribution along the ste the isotopic composition of the groundwater and seawater end member samples showed contrasted compositions fig 3 the mean inland groundwater δ2h was 64 1 4 1 and δ18o was 9 8 0 6 these depleted values were comparable with data obtained in an eastern region of québec chaillou et al 2017 and reflected the role of snow melt on aquifer recharge in these regions seawater δ2h was 12 7 1 6 and δ18o was 2 0 0 1 the isotope signature of beach groundwater was slightly below the groundwater seawater mixing line probably due to evaporating processes during the groundwater transit from the aquifer to the coastal zone through the shallow surficial beach aquifer however both the absence of distinct isotopic signatures along the ste and similarity between fresh beach and inland groundwater suggest a common origin and the absence of additional fresh endmember groundwater to the nearshore zone using these stable isotope signatures it was possible to calculate the contribution of fresh inland groundwater to the beach samples using a simple two end member mixing model based on mean fresh groundwater 64 1 δ2h 9 8 δ18o and seawater 12 7 δ2h 2 0 δ18o values the proportion of fresh groundwater was between 30 in the intertidal zone and 97 in the deepest part of ste fig 4 a thus the contribution of the marine end member was limited to the upper recirculation cell these results agree with the recent modeling work of heiss and michael 2014 who showed that the beach groundwater is mostly fresh when water table is maximum the size of the circulation cell and area of the mixing zone were mostly affected by seasonal water table oscillations and the intertidal circulation cell limited horizontally and vertically as the inland water table increased heiss and michael 2014 the snowmelt which is the major period of aquifer recharge in this cold region induced the landward displacement of the fresh discharge zone and probably support a high fresh sgd flux to the coastal zone the spatial limitation of the upper recirculation cell was also supported by the vertical 222rn distribution fig 4b and c which showed a downward gradient starting at 0 3 m in m3 and 0 8 m in m7 below the surface deeper 222rn values rapidly increased and reached values higher than 12 000 bq m3 which was in the range of values measured in inland wells table 2 supporting the idea of a similar production source of 222rn both in inland and beach groundwater 222rn activity in beach groundwater was not simply reflected in the transport of 222rn enriched fresh groundwater 222rn is produced locally and hydraulic conductivity does not control its activity in addition to the transport of inland groundwater the in situ production from mineral bound 226ra controlled the distribution of 222rn fully understanding the role of mineral bound 226ra as source of 222rn in these groundwater samples would require specific emanation experiments which are beyond the scope of this paper nevertheless the vertical distribution of 226ra allowed to estimate maximal activities distribution of groundwater 222rn assuming secular equilibrium the high activity of mineral bound 226ra at depths below 0 5 m fig 4c probably reflected the lithologic difference between the deep permian sandstone aquifer and the holocene sediment associated with changes in porosity and hydraulic conductivity the 222rn activities measured below 0 5 m depth in 2013 and 2015 and by two different approaches table 1 were slightly lower than 226ra activity in mineral matrix suggesting that 222rn in groundwater was near secular equilibrium with 226ra chaillou et al 2016 proposed a transit time of 32 days though the 35 m beach transect from m1 to m7 fig 2 beyond the mean life of radon 5 5 d indicating the importance of in situ production from mineral bound 226ra as in inland groundwater the well defined concave upward profile of 222rn was attributed to the advective transport of 222rn rich water and its mixing with the 222rn poor overlying seawater the lowest activities at the surface indicated that the residence time was not sufficient to reach secular equilibrium this zone of deficiency is consistent with the position of the surficial recirculation cell 3 2 tidal flow dynamics at the nearshore aquifer 3 2 1 tide as a dynamic wave time series of water levels and tidal oscillation indicated a strong synchronicity between tides and beach groundwater levels in the tidal zone of the bay fig 5 a piezometers p3 and p13 a cross correlation analysis between tidal oscillation using the cam station as the input function and beach groundwater levels at p3 and p13 as the output functions showed a strong relationship with rxy k values of 0 89 p3 and 0 67 p13 at maximum correlation this relation was not significant with the p44 time series which was too far from the nearshore zone to record tidal oscillation a frequency analysis of these time series shows the effect of tidal constituents fig 5b the five major constituents o1 k1 m2 s2 and m3 clearly controlled the water level in the tidal zone and particularly at the low tide mark explaining more than 30 cm of the fluctuation at p3 11 cm at p13 and less than 2 cm at p44 table2 the damped tidal signal at p44 shows that the tide had limited impact outside the intertidal zone the tidal propagation velocity in the intertidal zone can be estimated from time lags between p3 and p13 derived from the cross correlation analysis the groundwater crest reached p13 only 10 min later than p3 indicating that the pressure wave moved through ste at approximately 60 m h this value is 4 5 orders of magnitude higher than the maximum horizontal flow velocity of 30 cm d previously estimated by assuming an isotropic aquifer with a permeability k 11 4 103 cm d the non conservation of the fluctuation across the transect table 2 the delayed and dampened signal through the ste and the high propagation velocity of the wave support the idea that the tide propagated as a dynamic wave within the ste without mass displacement of seawater into the ste the formation of a recirculation cell and of its associated mixing zone only resulted from the vertical infiltration of seawater during the falling tide within the unsaturated zone between the water table and the beach surface 3 2 2 groundwater discharge dynamics at the beach face hydraulic heads were used to compute hydraulic gradients in the beach and calculate darcy flows at the discharge zone chaillou et al 2016 previously used a mean head gradient at 0 025 a value integrated over the study period of 16 days to calculate an average groundwater flux without considering temporal variations induced by tidal oscillations a horizontal hydraulic gradient was calculated between piezometer pairs from the inland to the sea p44 p13 p13 p3 and p44 p3 to produce a continuous head gradient time series in fig 6 we observe the changing nature of exchanges between seawater and groundwater through tidal cycles regardless of the position in the ste the rising water table induced by tidal wave propagation contributed to dynamic horizontal gradients these horizontal head gradients rapidly changed and were negatively correlated with the tidal oscillations recorded in the bay the head gradient was maximal at low tide and fell to minimum values at high tide although the gradient changed rapidly during the transition from rising to falling tide it showed a plateau with almost constant values during the transition from falling to rising tide hydraulic gradients induced in the intertidal zone remained constant over four to six hours around low tide this pattern reflected the infiltration of seawater in the unsaturated zone during the downward migration of the water table at that point the horizontal gradient was positive most of the time except during a few sporadic periods when the tide range was the highest 28 29 may hence since the time averaged beach hydraulic gradient was higher than sea level it drove beach groundwater towards the discharge zone of the beach thus seawater that entered the ste via vertical infiltration filled the empty space only when the water table dropped during the falling tide the inland head gradient was sufficiently high at snow melt period to limit the infiltration of seawater within the ste confirming the importance of fresh nature of the ste at the period based on darcy s law and assuming that the hydraulic gradient component parallel to the coastline was null groundwater fluxes in the beach aquifer q cm d were calculated as 5 5 q kgrad h where k is the mean hydraulic conductivity a continuous time series of q was calculated fig 6c using the average hydraulic conductivity and the average head gradient along the beach transect qmean values ranged from 19 to 43 cm d the pattern of qmean values parallels that of grad h with the highest fluxes during low tide and the lowest at high tide this tidal pumping effect is generally seen as an asymmetric seawater recirculation process see santos et al 2009a in which infiltration of seawater is large during rising tide and infiltration discharge is smaller during falling tides here a detailed examination of the beach groundwater fluxes shows a different pattern infiltration and discharge were symmetrical the high and constant fluxes measured during the transition period between falling and rising tide are expected to reflect the outflow of the seawater infiltrated within the unsaturated zone li et al 1999 this maximal flux was relatively constant over the study period and close to 38 40 cm d to convert these results to volumetric flux which is the discharge per unit width of the aquifer in m3 s the cross sectional flow area was determined using global positioning system gps measurements of 1200 m of shoreline chaillou et al 2016 based on the ghyben herzberg and glover relationship cooper et al 1964 the top 7 7 m of the aquifer at the discharge zone p3 is fresh except for the narrow surficial recirculation cell hence using a depth of 7 7 m the maximal volumetric groundwater flux through the discharge zone was 0 040 0 043 m3 s assuming a uniform hydraulic conductivity k and an isotropic shallow aquifer all along the 1200 m of shoreline these fluxes were 30 higher than those previously reported by chaillou et al 2016 who neglected the effect of tidal oscillations in the intertidal zone i e an average of 0 029 m3 s the outflow of the seawater infiltrated within the unsaturated part of the intertidal zone explains the difference in the calculation this outflow contributed to only around 30 of the total discharge at the nearshore and is relatively small compared to the contribution of seawater reported that usually represented more than 90 of the total sgd whatever the season martin et al 2007 mulligan and charette 2006 taniguchi et al 2002 3 3 sgd estimation in front of the discharge zone the high resolution radon survey was done on 29 may 2013 table 1 when nearshore flow is supposed to be comprise between 30 and 40 cm d i e 0 04 m3 s whatever the tide level fig 6c fig 7 presents the spatial distribution of the dataset 222rn activities in the bay ranged from 6 to 66 bq m3 and were three orders of magnitude lower than in inland and beach groundwater 12 000 17 000 bq m3 the water depth in the studied area is 3 5 m and the water is assumed to be vertically well mixed even though the studied area is small 0 180 km2 the radon and physicochemical measurements showed spatial heterogeneity in front of the beach this distribution resulted from the spatial patchiness of sgd at the discharge zone blanco et al 2008 welti et al 2015 as well as the tidal effect that change the hydraulic gradient in the coastal aquifer and dilute the tracer concentrations in the water column burnett and dulaiova 2003 dulaiova et al 2010 the continuous radon measurements indicated high activities up to 50 bq m3 at the nearshore and a decrease with distance from the shore these high activities were associated with lower electrical conductivities temperature data also showed a gradient from the beach to the bay that was probably linked to water depth from 0 5 to 3 5 m and tide level the two clusters revealed by hca analysis indicated that the data set is distributed in function of the distance from the shore whatever the tide level fig 7d the cluster 2 n 16 table 3 in the front of the beach showed the highest 222rn activities and the lowest conductivities in the cluster 1 n 11 table 3 222rn activities were lower and conductivity was higher the ste was a diffuse source of 222rn enriched groundwater to the bay assuming a well vertical mixing in these shallow coastal waters the radon in each cluster was assumed to be at steady state and the radon derived mass balance was estimated in each box the values used to determine total sgd fluxes are reported in table 4 the calculated excess flux of 222rn was two times higher in the nearshore compared to the offshore box with f gw decreasing from 5 35 to 2 65 107 bq d a well defined groundwater end member is needed to convert these 222rn fluxes to volumetric sgd fluxes atkins et al 2013 baudron et al 2015 smith and swarzenski 2012 the approach consisted in choosing a regional groundwater end member that represented the 222rn activity of the advected fluid whatever its salinity radon activities measured in inland groundwater ranged from 12 000 to 17 000 bq m3 the archipelago s permian aquifer is often considered as having homogeneous geochemical and hydrogeological characteristics comte and banton 2007 its residence time has been estimated to range between one and four years madelin eau 2004 well beyond the time of production from mineral bound 226ra the range of radon activities was larger in beach groundwater ranging from a few bq m3 at the surface to 21 000 bq m3 in the deep part of the ste and was not dependent of the salinity fig 8 excluding the radon activities from the surficial saline samples the mean radon activity of local groundwater that included both fresh inland and beach groundwater were 14 067 bq m3 this value represented a realistic end member for radon activity in advected fluid and led to volumetric discharges of sgd q gw to the bay ranging from 0 021 to 0 044 m3 s table 4 the main fluxes influencing the mass balance were the tidal fluxes in both directions whereas wind speed and 222rn evasion to the atmosphere had a low impact on the budget table 4 this tide driven flux estimate was based on a simple model where tide propagated as a constant volume of water in and out of the two clusters with no loss to the adjacent area due to longshore currents as in streams or estuaries atkins et al 2013 even though uncertainties were high with this approach 222rn derived sgd equal to the darcy flow i e from 0 034 to 0 041 m3 s the day of the survey comparing sgd estimation techniques in relation to scaling is still a challenge here the excellent agreement between both radon and hydrological based estimates of sgd is explained by the high spatial resolution of radon measurements the integration of tidal oscillation in the darcy flow estimation and an accurate rn end member value because it uses many point measurements over the area of interest the rn based approach integrates both the spatial and tidal variabilities of the groundwater discharge and allow an accurate ste integrated estimating of sgd to the bay to compare the volumetric estimates from this study with those of the literature the volumetric fluxes were divided by the length of shoreline 1200 m the shore normal estimates ranged from 3 1 m3 m d and 1 5 m3 m d from the nearshore to the bay respectively this shoreline flux shows magnitudes equal to other microtidal ste such as waquoit bay cape cod massachusetts 4 5 6 m3 m d mulligan and charette 2006 the gulf of thailand 3 7 7 8 m3 m d burnett et al 2007 western australia 2 5 8 m3 m d smith and nield 2003 shelter island long island new york 0 4 17 m3 m d burnett et al 2006 and turkey point florida 0 7 22 m3 m d santos et al 2009b estimate the fresh sgd contribution to these total fluxes is not straightforward two approaches were implemented to choose an appropriate fresh sgd fluxes a first one based on a regional and multi annual hydrological mass balance of the permian aquifer and a second one based on darcy flow estimated in the beach over the sampling period using the hydrological model proposed by madelin eau 2004 the average fresh inland groundwater discharge is about 1 6 m3 m d based on a decade of water level and on an average recharge rate of 230 mm y i e 25 30 of the annual snow and rain precipitation this average flux represented 50 of the total sgd we measured near shore this approach provided a conservative contribution despite it being based on an annual dynamic of recharge discharge of the main island aquifer the alternative approach provides an estimate of fresh groundwater flow of 2 1 m3 m d i e 0 029 m3 s chaillou et al 2016 during the sampling period leading to a fresh contribution of 67 at the near shore in both cases fresh groundwater is then an important source of water to martinique bay compared to other studied sites where the fresh inland groundwater contribution was often less than few percent this high fresh groundwater fluxes were in agreement with isotopic and hydrologic results obtained within the ste the snowmelt and absence of river in the archipelago contributed to the marked enhancement of fresh inland groundwater input to the bay during the snow melt period despite the fact that these results need further improvement notably with more radon surveys at different seasons this first sgd derived 222rn estimation already provided reliable sgd discharge through a snowmelt affected ste during the spring season when the water table is high these findings also point out the crucial spring period when snow melts and fresh inland groundwater acts as a path of anthropogenic solutes to marine environments 4 conclusions this paper presented further evidence on the importance of boreal sandy beaches as a source of fresh groundwater to adjacent marine environments particularly after the snow melt the unique multi parametric approach used in this study provided improved estimates of groundwater flow and solute transport through the discharge zone the distribution of δ18o and δ2h in beach groundwater showed that fresh inland groundwater issue from snowmelt contributed from 30 to 97 of the water mass in the ste in the deep part the residence time of groundwater was sufficiently long that 222rn in groundwater was near secular equilibrium with mineral bound 226ra at the surface however the advective upward transport of 222rn rich water and mixing with 222rn poor overlying seawater induced a loss in 222rn a time series of water table levels along the ste transect revealed that the tide propagated as a dynamic wave limiting the displacement of seawater within the ste this up and down movement of the water table induced the vertical infiltration of seawater into the unsaturated part of the sediment which is very limited due to the high water table in the bay a radon based mass balance model based on a high resolution 222rn survey revealed shore normal discharges ranging from 3 1 m3 m d at the shore to 1 5 m3 m d these nearshore discharges agreed quite well with darcy fluxes calculated in the ste fresh inland groundwater makes up more than 50 of the total discharge suggesting that boreal sandy beaches are important sources of freshwater and potential paths of groundwater borne solutes to marine environments particularly in the snowmelt season this study demonstrated that it is crucial

7475,the study is based on a complex and unique data set of water stable isotopes i e δ18o and δ2h radon 222 activities i e 222rn and groundwater levels to better understand the interaction of fresh groundwater and recirculated seawater in a snowmelt affected subterranean estuary ste in a boreal region îles de la madeleine qc canada by using a combination of hydrogeological and marine geochemical approaches the objective was to analyze and quantify submarine groundwater discharge processes through a boreal beach after the snow melt period in early june the distribution of δ18o and δ2h in beach groundwater showed that inland fresh groundwater contributed between 97 and 30 of water masses presented within the ste a time series of water table levels during the 16 days of the study indicated that tides propagated as a dynamic wave limiting the mass displacement of seawater within the ste this up and down movement of the water table 10 30 cm induced the vertical infiltration of seawater at the falling tide at the front of the beach a radon based mass balance calculated with high resolution 222rn survey estimated total sgd of 3 1 m3 m d at the discharge zone and a mean flow to 1 5 m3 m d in the bay the nearshore discharge agreed relatively well with darcy fluxes calculated at the beach face fresh groundwater makes up more than 50 of the total discharge during the measuring campaign these results indicate that beaches in boreal and cold regions could be important sources of freshwater originate and groundwater borne solutes and contaminants to the marine environment after the snowmelt keywords stable isotopes of water radon 222 222rn water table level submarine groundwater discharge beach aquifer boreal and cold region 1 introduction submarine groundwater discharge sgd is widely recognized as a significant transport pathway for chemicals entering the coastal ocean li et al 1999 moore 2010 robinson et al 2007 this is particularly important where rapidly growing coastal populations induce complex changes in landscapes and ecosystems as well as increased pressure on coastal water resources in locations around the world deterioration in coastal water quality e g bacterial proliferation harmful algal blooms hypoxia acidification fish and shellfish mortality have been attributed to changes in the quality and volume of groundwater discharged to the ocean hwang et al 2010 valiela et al 1990 the intertidal and nearshore zones of sandy beaches play key roles in the connection across the coastal continuum from watershed to coast heiss and michael 2014 robinson et al 2007 moore 1999 coined the term subterranean estuary ste for the beach aquifer to emphasize the importance of freshwater and seawater mixing and water rock interactions as fresh groundwater transits toward the sea similarly to surficial estuaries solute concentrations change greatly in the dispersion zone of the subterranean estuary beck et al 2015 their chemical behaviors within the ste are complex and closely tied to the subsurface salinity distribution multiple physical forces drive subsurface flow and residence times and thus control the reaction rates and transformations in this biogeochemically active zone cable and martin 2008 michael et al 2005 robinson et al 2007 santos et al 2012 identified at least 12 independent drivers that include both terrestrial e g hydraulic gradient seasonal oscillation of the water table and marine e g wave and tidal pumping ripple and bed form migration bioirrigation processes that interact in complex ways these processes force flow across the water sediment interface albeit under different spatial and temporal scales and consequently influence the export of groundwater borne recirculated and newly formed compounds to the sea thus an in depth understanding of the hydrological sgd processes is necessary to accurately predict chemical fluxes to coastal environments the nearshore area of the beach aquifer is a dynamic zone where fresh groundwater exits the subterranean system through a narrow discharge zone often bounded by two saline zones at the seaward boundary below the discharge zone the saltwater wedge is a fresh groundwater seawater interface induced by a density gradient where dispersion dominates the exchanges the nearshore location of this interface moves on a seasonal scale michael et al 2005 in relation to the hydraulic pressure and density difference between fresh and seawater at the landward boundary above the discharge zone of fresh groundwater tides and waves drive seawater into the beach aquifer forming an upper surficial recirculation cell where advection is the primary process by which solutes move across the sediment water interface the resulting hydraulic gradient generates downward and seaward circulations of seawater to the nearshore aquifer which forms a seawater freshwater mixing zone where dispersion dominates the chemical processes abarca et al 2013 heiss and michael 2014 ullman et al 2003 xin et al 2010 many recent studies on groundwater dynamics in beaches employed groundwater models based on salinity and sometimes on water level measurements abarca et al 2013 evans and wilson 2017 heiss and michael 2014 heiss et al 2014 robinson et al 2007 xin et al 2010 these investigations have all highlighted the necessity to obtain integrated in situ measurements of sgd in specific sites to characterize the nearshore groundwater dynamics in boreal and cold regions the water table elevation is high after snow melt i e in early june inducing in the inland aquifer a strong horizontal head gradient perpendicular to the shore and high darcy flows to the coastal embayment chaillou et al 2016 however these cold regions are still rarely considered as sgd sources a more detailed knowledge of groundwater discharge and particularly of fresh groundwater is critical to the determination of regional and global mass fluxes to coastal zones such quantification is particularly crucial in the north where the hydrology is changing rapidly and is expected to continuously change in response to climate warming adam et al 2009 the aim of this study was to combine hydrogeological and geochemical in situ measurements to analyze sgd processes in a snowmelt affected ste settled in the îles de la madeleine an archipelago located in the southeastern of the gulf of st lawrence the study relied on a time series analysis of hydraulic heads measured along a shore perpendicular transect of multilevel sampling wells to examine the effect of tidal oscillation on the mixing zone the spatial and temporal distribution of radon 222 222rn an effective proxy of short term processes t1 2 3 8d at the groundwater surface water interface burnett et al 2001 and stable isotopes of water δ18o and δ2h were also examined to characterize the fresh groundwater dynamics and to estimate the magnitude of fresh groundwater discharge to the bay after the snowmelt in early june according to our knowledge this study presents the first in depth analyses of nearshore groundwater dynamics influenced by the snowmelt in a boreal sandy beach 2 materials and methods 2 1 hydrological context of the study area this study was conducted in the subterranean estuary at martinique beach on îles de la madeleine in the province of québec canada fig 1 the hydrogeological context of the îles de la madeleine has been presented by comte and banton 2007 the main aquifer of the archipelago is composed of sandstones from the permian inferior period the cap aux meules formation brisebois 1981 with a mean transmissivity of 1 5 4 10 3 m2 s and a mean recharge of 230 mm y i e 25 30 of the annual precipitation madelin eau 2004 groundwater flows through the unconfined permian sandstone aquifer and discharges to the sea both directly and through the overlying quaternary deposits martinique beach originates from a recent transgression sequence the rapid rates of sea level rise along the atlantic coasts of canada over the middle to late holocene buried the unconfined permian sandstone aquifer that is now covered by tidal sediments these buried environments are geological evidence of local and regional submergences over the last millennia scott et al 1995 sediment cores collected on martinique beach were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy sem coupled to an energy dispersive x ray spectrometer and revealed that the quaternary sediment of the beach are 300 μm and mainly composed of silicate mixed with small amount of silt 5 the underlying sandstone aquifer is composed of fine red orange sands 100 μm composed of silicate and aluminosilicate chaillou et al 2014 its localization in the beach and its offshore extent is unknown the site experiences little wave action except during storm events tides are semi diurnal with a spring tide range 1 m previous studies on groundwater discharge and biogeochemistry of the superficial ste have been conducted at this site chaillou et al 2016 chaillou et al 2014 couturier et al 2016 the shallow superficial unconfined beach aquifer releases both fresh groundwater and recirculated seawater to the coastal embayment within the beach fresh groundwater flows towards the seaward discharge region below a narrow intruding saline circulation cell located near the top of intertidal sediments in spring 2013 chaillou et al 2016 used mean regional and local water table levels to estimate groundwater flows ranging from 0 02 m d in the sandstone permian aquifer to 0 30 m d at the beach face 2 2 field measurements 2 2 1 water table levels and hydrogeological properties three piezometers equipped with pressure sensors were installed in a 45 m transect of the study site perpendicular to the beach front figs 1c and 2 the first piezometer was located at the mean low tide mark p3 the second one was located in the intertidal area 10 m further inland p13 and the third was located on the beach terrace 43 m from p3 p44 fig 2 the piezometers were made from 38 mm id pvc pipes sealed at the base and equipped with 0 4 m long screens at the bottom end at every location piezometers extended 1 50 m below the beach surface so that the bottom end would always be below the water table automated level loggers hobo u20 001 recorded groundwater levels every 10 mins from 20 may 2013 to 7 june 2013 16 days time series were corrected for barometric pressure from a barologger located at the study site a permanent government of canada sea level station cap aux meules cam station 1970 http tides gc ca was used as a reference the station is located at 5 km from the study site fig 1b this station recorded water levels every three minutes during the sampling period guelph permeameter measurements n 15 provided a mean hydraulic conductivity of 11 4 4 4 m d in the unsaturated surficial sands 2 2 2 stable isotopes of water and physicochemical parameters of groundwater groundwater was sampled for salinity 222rn and stable isotopes of water at high 27 31 may 2013 and low 3 june 2013 tides a 20 m cross shore transect of multi level samplers m1 7 fig 2 was set up in the intertidal zone where beach groundwater and recirculating seawater most likely discharge the multi level samplers consisted of 2 5 m pvc pipes with eight ports connected to flexible tygon tubing as described in martin et al 2003 multi level samplers were designed to collect water at 10 30 50 80 110 150 190 and 230 cm below the beach surface beach groundwater was pumped with a peristaltic pump into an in line flow cell where specific conductivity spcond dissolved oxygen saturation do temperature and ph were monitored using a calibrated multiparametric probe 600qs ysi inc after stabilization of physicochemical parameters groundwater was collected in 30 ml scintillation vials for water isotope analysis the radon approach is described in the next section groundwater end member samples were collected in the manner described above from private and municipal water wells pp and pm respectively located 50 and 2000 m inshore of the cross shore transect fig 1b c private wells were purged before the sampling seawater end member samples were collected approximately 50 cm below the seawater surface using a submersible pump about 900 m offshore in martinique bay stable isotopes of water δ18o δ2h are used as conservative tracers of mixing processes to investigate and quantify meteoric groundwater seawater interaction since seawater and meteoric groundwater have unique and distinct end member signatures povinec et al 2012 schiavo et al 2009 stable isotopes of water δ18o and δ2h were analyzed by ea irms at the geotop uqam laboratory accuracies are 0 05 at the 1σ level and 1 at the 1σ level for δ18o and δ2h respectively isotopic analyses are reported compared to the international vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow as defined by gonfiantini 1978 reference materials were used throughout the isotopic water analyses to ensure high quality data 2 2 3 222rn measurements 2 2 3 1 high resolution 222rn survey in the bay radon was used as a geochemical tracer to estimate total submarine groundwater discharge into the bay 222rn is an effective qualitative and quantitative tracer because groundwater concentrations are typically higher than those in coastal seawater regardless of fluid origin or composition it mixes conservatively once introduced to seawater a high resolution spatial survey of 222rn was performed on 29 may 2013 over 12 h to identify the general distribution of rn in the bay surface area 0 6 km 0 3 km 0 180 km2 and to quantify total sgd after the snow melt 222rn activity was measured according to dulaiova et al 2005 by a radon in air detector connected to an air water exchanger showerhead type exchanger rad aqua durridge from a small boat water was continuously collected from a submersible pump at 50 cm below the boat and injected into the spray chamber at a rate of 3 l min 1 the water depth was continuously recorded by a dualbeam sonar 200 khz and 83 khz with and gps chartplotting after 20 min of preliminary air water equilibration in the middle of the bay 0 7 km from the shoreline the equilibrated air was continuously pumped through drierite desiccant to the rad7 radon detector the rad7 estimates 222rn activity by measuring the decay of the radioactive daughters 218po and 214po as described by burnett et al 2010 here the 222rn activity was measured over 10 min of count integration as the boat moved slowly 1 2 km h the radon activity of each run was associated with a gps trace mean water depth and mean physicochemical parameters spcond t do continuously recorded sampling period 1 min by a calibrated automatic multiparametric probe fixed near the submersible pump this produced 28 segments in the 0 180 km2 studied area that are represented by 28 points positioned at the middle of the gps segments temperature and humidity were monitored continuously during experiments and served to automatically correct radon in water activities using the capture software from durridge analytical uncertainties based on counting statistics are approximately 48 2σ 2 2 3 2 222rn measurements in inland and beach groundwater fresh groundwater end members were also analyzed using an in situ radon in water approach similar to that described above a submersible pump was lowered into municipal and private wells and water was continuously injected into the spray chamber after 20 min of air water equilibration the 222rn activities were analyzed over four 10 min runs radon in water measures were automatically corrected using temperature and humidity the analytical uncertainty was approximately 15 2σ each 222rn activity was associated with measurements of spcond t do and ph measured by a mutliparametric probe fixed on the pump a second survey of 222rn activities in the fresh groundwater end members was also performed in june 2015 at that time discrete water samples were collected in 2l plastic bottles that were tightly sealed the water was bubbled to allow 222rn degassing in the bottle s 30 ml head space rad h2o durridge as with the rad aqua technique the equilibrated air flows through drierite desiccant to the radon in air detector rad7 durridge and is then re injected into the bottle s head space to close the loop the air volume of the closed loop and water volume of the bottle are known and constant over the measurement and they are independent of flow rate the air recirculates through the water and continuously extracts the radon until a state of equilibrium develops radon in water activities were corrected using temperature and humidity measurements finally 222rn activity was corrected for the initial radon decay that took place between sampling and analysis analytical uncertainties were less than 12 2σ efforts were also made to measure 222rn activities in beach groundwater to obtain an accurate estimate of radon groundwater end member additional 222rn measurements were performed in june 2015 at the m3 and m7 multi level samplers at this period water was collected in 2l sample bottles that were tightly sealed and analyses were performed as described above table 1 gives a summary of the different measurements of rn performed for the study 2 3 mineral bound 226ra activity the 226ra activity of sediments was determined using samples collected from surficial holocene inshore and offshore sediment and in the underlying permian sandstone aquifer using a hand auger thirteen sediment samples were collected from the surface to 1 5 m depth these measurements were done as a first attempt of the activity of 226ra supported 222rn in beach groundwater sediment samples were dried crushed and sealed in vials fitted for a high purity germanium gamma ray spectrometer ortec dspec jr 2 0 they were left in sealed vials for at least 23 days to ensure radioactive re equilibration between the 226ra and the short lived daughters of the 238u series zielinski et al 2001 counting time was fixed at 3 4 days to provide adequate counts for the peaks of interest 226ra counts were based on the measurement of 214pb using the 295 2 and 352 kev and 214bi 609 kev peaks the counting error is 10 disintegrations per minutes dpm g were converted in bq m3 of wet sediment the diffusive production of 222rn from the sediments underlying the bay were calculated using the relation proposed by burnett and dulaiova 2003 as follow 1 1 j diff 0 495 226 ra 0 303 where 226ra is the activity of the sediment bq kg 2 4 analyses of water table levels cross correlation time lag and tidal harmonic analysis tidal propagation in ste has often been studied by combining darcy s law either with analytical solutions elgar 1999 li et al 1999 using cross correlation analysis rotzoll and el kadi 2008 or using numerical models abarca et al 2013 robinson et al 2007 here the intensity of the relationship and the time lag of the whole time series were determined by cross correlating water levels from the ocean and unconfined beach aquifer in addition each time series was analyzed by a time frequency analysis and compared to a theoretical tide signal using a classical tidal harmonic analysis the tidal signal may be decomposed into 17 constituents including five major ones that contribute to approximately 95 of the signal the diurnal harmonic components and their frequencies h 1 are o1 0 03873 and k1 0 04178 while the semidiurnal components are m2 0 08051 s2 0 08333 and m3 0 12076 correlations between time series and purely tide induced oscillations as well as the amplitude of each tidal constituent were estimated to better understand the tidal propagation throughout the beach time series analyses were performed with rstudio using the applied statistical time series analysis stata package baum 2004 and tidal harmonic analyses were performed with matlab 2 5 quantification of sgd 2 5 1 222rn water column mass balance sgd estimations in martinique bay were based on a steady state 222rn derived mass balance model proposed by burnett et al 2008 assuming a steady state for the 12 h integration period i e one complete tidal cycle the mass balance model incorporates sources of 222rn input flux σ f in balanced by losses output flux σ f out the excess of 222rn is attributed to the total groundwater input f gw as follows 2 f gw σ f in σ f out where 3 σ f in f in f riv f diff f resup f prod 4 σ f out f out f decay f atm the excess input flux of 222rn is the sum of martinique bay input f in due to local circulation i e currents and tides river input friv chemical diffusion from underlying sediment fdiff due to 1 production of resuspended sediment fresup and internal production in the water column fprod output flux integrates the loss of excess 222rn by natural radioactive decay in the water column fdecay the loss to the atmosphere fatm and the flux that leaves the box f out due to local water circulation i e currents and tides here surficial input from rivers f riv is not relevant in the calculations since there is no surficial water flow in the study area in addition 222rn growth from 226ra decay in the water column f prod is not considered because it is often assumed to be limited or null in tidal environments see peterson et al 2010 based on the continuous measurements of t spcond and 222rn in the bay a multivariate statistical approach was applied to determine sample clusters where radon and physicochemical parameters could be assumed as homogeneous regardless the tide cycle and the location this method often used in hydrogeochemistry studies is a quantitative and independent approach for classifying and grouping water samples in this study a hierarchical cluster analysis hca was applied a k means clustering determined the exact number of clusters to extract from the database a plot of the within group sum of squares by the number of clusters extracted revealed that only two clusters accurately classified the dataset the subsequent hca analysis revealed that each of the clusters was also composed of two subgroups of samples which corresponded to the samples collected at falling and rising tide respectively steady state water column mass balance of excess 222rn was then applied for each cluster assuming that for a given water column depth and surface area the 222rn inventory is in steady state sgd were quantified in each cluster calculating the different input and output fluxes i e eqs 2 4 as described in details in baudron et al 2015 and modified from dulaiova et al 2010 and smith and swarzenski 2012 tidal currents induce tracer exchanges between the different cluster f in in eq 3 and f out in eq 4 and offshore seawater tide acts as both a source and a loss of 222rn in the water column mass balance no data are available on long shore and tidal currents in the martinique bay as a first approximation long shore current is assumed to be limited in this small study area and only tides are included in the model the input output volume of water induced by tide is assumed to be equal this volume is estimated based on a tidal range of 0 8 m during the sampling period the mean distance between the high and low tide marks of 30 m and the width of the studied zone of 300 m this represented a water volume of 56 700 m3 that transits in the seaward direction during ebb tide exporting 222rn enriched water and an equal volume of seawater that flows landward at flood tide with 222rn poor seawater therefore the net flux was a combination of these exchanges 3 results and discussion 3 1 fresh inland groundwater distribution along the ste the isotopic composition of the groundwater and seawater end member samples showed contrasted compositions fig 3 the mean inland groundwater δ2h was 64 1 4 1 and δ18o was 9 8 0 6 these depleted values were comparable with data obtained in an eastern region of québec chaillou et al 2017 and reflected the role of snow melt on aquifer recharge in these regions seawater δ2h was 12 7 1 6 and δ18o was 2 0 0 1 the isotope signature of beach groundwater was slightly below the groundwater seawater mixing line probably due to evaporating processes during the groundwater transit from the aquifer to the coastal zone through the shallow surficial beach aquifer however both the absence of distinct isotopic signatures along the ste and similarity between fresh beach and inland groundwater suggest a common origin and the absence of additional fresh endmember groundwater to the nearshore zone using these stable isotope signatures it was possible to calculate the contribution of fresh inland groundwater to the beach samples using a simple two end member mixing model based on mean fresh groundwater 64 1 δ2h 9 8 δ18o and seawater 12 7 δ2h 2 0 δ18o values the proportion of fresh groundwater was between 30 in the intertidal zone and 97 in the deepest part of ste fig 4 a thus the contribution of the marine end member was limited to the upper recirculation cell these results agree with the recent modeling work of heiss and michael 2014 who showed that the beach groundwater is mostly fresh when water table is maximum the size of the circulation cell and area of the mixing zone were mostly affected by seasonal water table oscillations and the intertidal circulation cell limited horizontally and vertically as the inland water table increased heiss and michael 2014 the snowmelt which is the major period of aquifer recharge in this cold region induced the landward displacement of the fresh discharge zone and probably support a high fresh sgd flux to the coastal zone the spatial limitation of the upper recirculation cell was also supported by the vertical 222rn distribution fig 4b and c which showed a downward gradient starting at 0 3 m in m3 and 0 8 m in m7 below the surface deeper 222rn values rapidly increased and reached values higher than 12 000 bq m3 which was in the range of values measured in inland wells table 2 supporting the idea of a similar production source of 222rn both in inland and beach groundwater 222rn activity in beach groundwater was not simply reflected in the transport of 222rn enriched fresh groundwater 222rn is produced locally and hydraulic conductivity does not control its activity in addition to the transport of inland groundwater the in situ production from mineral bound 226ra controlled the distribution of 222rn fully understanding the role of mineral bound 226ra as source of 222rn in these groundwater samples would require specific emanation experiments which are beyond the scope of this paper nevertheless the vertical distribution of 226ra allowed to estimate maximal activities distribution of groundwater 222rn assuming secular equilibrium the high activity of mineral bound 226ra at depths below 0 5 m fig 4c probably reflected the lithologic difference between the deep permian sandstone aquifer and the holocene sediment associated with changes in porosity and hydraulic conductivity the 222rn activities measured below 0 5 m depth in 2013 and 2015 and by two different approaches table 1 were slightly lower than 226ra activity in mineral matrix suggesting that 222rn in groundwater was near secular equilibrium with 226ra chaillou et al 2016 proposed a transit time of 32 days though the 35 m beach transect from m1 to m7 fig 2 beyond the mean life of radon 5 5 d indicating the importance of in situ production from mineral bound 226ra as in inland groundwater the well defined concave upward profile of 222rn was attributed to the advective transport of 222rn rich water and its mixing with the 222rn poor overlying seawater the lowest activities at the surface indicated that the residence time was not sufficient to reach secular equilibrium this zone of deficiency is consistent with the position of the surficial recirculation cell 3 2 tidal flow dynamics at the nearshore aquifer 3 2 1 tide as a dynamic wave time series of water levels and tidal oscillation indicated a strong synchronicity between tides and beach groundwater levels in the tidal zone of the bay fig 5 a piezometers p3 and p13 a cross correlation analysis between tidal oscillation using the cam station as the input function and beach groundwater levels at p3 and p13 as the output functions showed a strong relationship with rxy k values of 0 89 p3 and 0 67 p13 at maximum correlation this relation was not significant with the p44 time series which was too far from the nearshore zone to record tidal oscillation a frequency analysis of these time series shows the effect of tidal constituents fig 5b the five major constituents o1 k1 m2 s2 and m3 clearly controlled the water level in the tidal zone and particularly at the low tide mark explaining more than 30 cm of the fluctuation at p3 11 cm at p13 and less than 2 cm at p44 table2 the damped tidal signal at p44 shows that the tide had limited impact outside the intertidal zone the tidal propagation velocity in the intertidal zone can be estimated from time lags between p3 and p13 derived from the cross correlation analysis the groundwater crest reached p13 only 10 min later than p3 indicating that the pressure wave moved through ste at approximately 60 m h this value is 4 5 orders of magnitude higher than the maximum horizontal flow velocity of 30 cm d previously estimated by assuming an isotropic aquifer with a permeability k 11 4 103 cm d the non conservation of the fluctuation across the transect table 2 the delayed and dampened signal through the ste and the high propagation velocity of the wave support the idea that the tide propagated as a dynamic wave within the ste without mass displacement of seawater into the ste the formation of a recirculation cell and of its associated mixing zone only resulted from the vertical infiltration of seawater during the falling tide within the unsaturated zone between the water table and the beach surface 3 2 2 groundwater discharge dynamics at the beach face hydraulic heads were used to compute hydraulic gradients in the beach and calculate darcy flows at the discharge zone chaillou et al 2016 previously used a mean head gradient at 0 025 a value integrated over the study period of 16 days to calculate an average groundwater flux without considering temporal variations induced by tidal oscillations a horizontal hydraulic gradient was calculated between piezometer pairs from the inland to the sea p44 p13 p13 p3 and p44 p3 to produce a continuous head gradient time series in fig 6 we observe the changing nature of exchanges between seawater and groundwater through tidal cycles regardless of the position in the ste the rising water table induced by tidal wave propagation contributed to dynamic horizontal gradients these horizontal head gradients rapidly changed and were negatively correlated with the tidal oscillations recorded in the bay the head gradient was maximal at low tide and fell to minimum values at high tide although the gradient changed rapidly during the transition from rising to falling tide it showed a plateau with almost constant values during the transition from falling to rising tide hydraulic gradients induced in the intertidal zone remained constant over four to six hours around low tide this pattern reflected the infiltration of seawater in the unsaturated zone during the downward migration of the water table at that point the horizontal gradient was positive most of the time except during a few sporadic periods when the tide range was the highest 28 29 may hence since the time averaged beach hydraulic gradient was higher than sea level it drove beach groundwater towards the discharge zone of the beach thus seawater that entered the ste via vertical infiltration filled the empty space only when the water table dropped during the falling tide the inland head gradient was sufficiently high at snow melt period to limit the infiltration of seawater within the ste confirming the importance of fresh nature of the ste at the period based on darcy s law and assuming that the hydraulic gradient component parallel to the coastline was null groundwater fluxes in the beach aquifer q cm d were calculated as 5 5 q kgrad h where k is the mean hydraulic conductivity a continuous time series of q was calculated fig 6c using the average hydraulic conductivity and the average head gradient along the beach transect qmean values ranged from 19 to 43 cm d the pattern of qmean values parallels that of grad h with the highest fluxes during low tide and the lowest at high tide this tidal pumping effect is generally seen as an asymmetric seawater recirculation process see santos et al 2009a in which infiltration of seawater is large during rising tide and infiltration discharge is smaller during falling tides here a detailed examination of the beach groundwater fluxes shows a different pattern infiltration and discharge were symmetrical the high and constant fluxes measured during the transition period between falling and rising tide are expected to reflect the outflow of the seawater infiltrated within the unsaturated zone li et al 1999 this maximal flux was relatively constant over the study period and close to 38 40 cm d to convert these results to volumetric flux which is the discharge per unit width of the aquifer in m3 s the cross sectional flow area was determined using global positioning system gps measurements of 1200 m of shoreline chaillou et al 2016 based on the ghyben herzberg and glover relationship cooper et al 1964 the top 7 7 m of the aquifer at the discharge zone p3 is fresh except for the narrow surficial recirculation cell hence using a depth of 7 7 m the maximal volumetric groundwater flux through the discharge zone was 0 040 0 043 m3 s assuming a uniform hydraulic conductivity k and an isotropic shallow aquifer all along the 1200 m of shoreline these fluxes were 30 higher than those previously reported by chaillou et al 2016 who neglected the effect of tidal oscillations in the intertidal zone i e an average of 0 029 m3 s the outflow of the seawater infiltrated within the unsaturated part of the intertidal zone explains the difference in the calculation this outflow contributed to only around 30 of the total discharge at the nearshore and is relatively small compared to the contribution of seawater reported that usually represented more than 90 of the total sgd whatever the season martin et al 2007 mulligan and charette 2006 taniguchi et al 2002 3 3 sgd estimation in front of the discharge zone the high resolution radon survey was done on 29 may 2013 table 1 when nearshore flow is supposed to be comprise between 30 and 40 cm d i e 0 04 m3 s whatever the tide level fig 6c fig 7 presents the spatial distribution of the dataset 222rn activities in the bay ranged from 6 to 66 bq m3 and were three orders of magnitude lower than in inland and beach groundwater 12 000 17 000 bq m3 the water depth in the studied area is 3 5 m and the water is assumed to be vertically well mixed even though the studied area is small 0 180 km2 the radon and physicochemical measurements showed spatial heterogeneity in front of the beach this distribution resulted from the spatial patchiness of sgd at the discharge zone blanco et al 2008 welti et al 2015 as well as the tidal effect that change the hydraulic gradient in the coastal aquifer and dilute the tracer concentrations in the water column burnett and dulaiova 2003 dulaiova et al 2010 the continuous radon measurements indicated high activities up to 50 bq m3 at the nearshore and a decrease with distance from the shore these high activities were associated with lower electrical conductivities temperature data also showed a gradient from the beach to the bay that was probably linked to water depth from 0 5 to 3 5 m and tide level the two clusters revealed by hca analysis indicated that the data set is distributed in function of the distance from the shore whatever the tide level fig 7d the cluster 2 n 16 table 3 in the front of the beach showed the highest 222rn activities and the lowest conductivities in the cluster 1 n 11 table 3 222rn activities were lower and conductivity was higher the ste was a diffuse source of 222rn enriched groundwater to the bay assuming a well vertical mixing in these shallow coastal waters the radon in each cluster was assumed to be at steady state and the radon derived mass balance was estimated in each box the values used to determine total sgd fluxes are reported in table 4 the calculated excess flux of 222rn was two times higher in the nearshore compared to the offshore box with f gw decreasing from 5 35 to 2 65 107 bq d a well defined groundwater end member is needed to convert these 222rn fluxes to volumetric sgd fluxes atkins et al 2013 baudron et al 2015 smith and swarzenski 2012 the approach consisted in choosing a regional groundwater end member that represented the 222rn activity of the advected fluid whatever its salinity radon activities measured in inland groundwater ranged from 12 000 to 17 000 bq m3 the archipelago s permian aquifer is often considered as having homogeneous geochemical and hydrogeological characteristics comte and banton 2007 its residence time has been estimated to range between one and four years madelin eau 2004 well beyond the time of production from mineral bound 226ra the range of radon activities was larger in beach groundwater ranging from a few bq m3 at the surface to 21 000 bq m3 in the deep part of the ste and was not dependent of the salinity fig 8 excluding the radon activities from the surficial saline samples the mean radon activity of local groundwater that included both fresh inland and beach groundwater were 14 067 bq m3 this value represented a realistic end member for radon activity in advected fluid and led to volumetric discharges of sgd q gw to the bay ranging from 0 021 to 0 044 m3 s table 4 the main fluxes influencing the mass balance were the tidal fluxes in both directions whereas wind speed and 222rn evasion to the atmosphere had a low impact on the budget table 4 this tide driven flux estimate was based on a simple model where tide propagated as a constant volume of water in and out of the two clusters with no loss to the adjacent area due to longshore currents as in streams or estuaries atkins et al 2013 even though uncertainties were high with this approach 222rn derived sgd equal to the darcy flow i e from 0 034 to 0 041 m3 s the day of the survey comparing sgd estimation techniques in relation to scaling is still a challenge here the excellent agreement between both radon and hydrological based estimates of sgd is explained by the high spatial resolution of radon measurements the integration of tidal oscillation in the darcy flow estimation and an accurate rn end member value because it uses many point measurements over the area of interest the rn based approach integrates both the spatial and tidal variabilities of the groundwater discharge and allow an accurate ste integrated estimating of sgd to the bay to compare the volumetric estimates from this study with those of the literature the volumetric fluxes were divided by the length of shoreline 1200 m the shore normal estimates ranged from 3 1 m3 m d and 1 5 m3 m d from the nearshore to the bay respectively this shoreline flux shows magnitudes equal to other microtidal ste such as waquoit bay cape cod massachusetts 4 5 6 m3 m d mulligan and charette 2006 the gulf of thailand 3 7 7 8 m3 m d burnett et al 2007 western australia 2 5 8 m3 m d smith and nield 2003 shelter island long island new york 0 4 17 m3 m d burnett et al 2006 and turkey point florida 0 7 22 m3 m d santos et al 2009b estimate the fresh sgd contribution to these total fluxes is not straightforward two approaches were implemented to choose an appropriate fresh sgd fluxes a first one based on a regional and multi annual hydrological mass balance of the permian aquifer and a second one based on darcy flow estimated in the beach over the sampling period using the hydrological model proposed by madelin eau 2004 the average fresh inland groundwater discharge is about 1 6 m3 m d based on a decade of water level and on an average recharge rate of 230 mm y i e 25 30 of the annual snow and rain precipitation this average flux represented 50 of the total sgd we measured near shore this approach provided a conservative contribution despite it being based on an annual dynamic of recharge discharge of the main island aquifer the alternative approach provides an estimate of fresh groundwater flow of 2 1 m3 m d i e 0 029 m3 s chaillou et al 2016 during the sampling period leading to a fresh contribution of 67 at the near shore in both cases fresh groundwater is then an important source of water to martinique bay compared to other studied sites where the fresh inland groundwater contribution was often less than few percent this high fresh groundwater fluxes were in agreement with isotopic and hydrologic results obtained within the ste the snowmelt and absence of river in the archipelago contributed to the marked enhancement of fresh inland groundwater input to the bay during the snow melt period despite the fact that these results need further improvement notably with more radon surveys at different seasons this first sgd derived 222rn estimation already provided reliable sgd discharge through a snowmelt affected ste during the spring season when the water table is high these findings also point out the crucial spring period when snow melts and fresh inland groundwater acts as a path of anthropogenic solutes to marine environments 4 conclusions this paper presented further evidence on the importance of boreal sandy beaches as a source of fresh groundwater to adjacent marine environments particularly after the snow melt the unique multi parametric approach used in this study provided improved estimates of groundwater flow and solute transport through the discharge zone the distribution of δ18o and δ2h in beach groundwater showed that fresh inland groundwater issue from snowmelt contributed from 30 to 97 of the water mass in the ste in the deep part the residence time of groundwater was sufficiently long that 222rn in groundwater was near secular equilibrium with mineral bound 226ra at the surface however the advective upward transport of 222rn rich water and mixing with 222rn poor overlying seawater induced a loss in 222rn a time series of water table levels along the ste transect revealed that the tide propagated as a dynamic wave limiting the displacement of seawater within the ste this up and down movement of the water table induced the vertical infiltration of seawater into the unsaturated part of the sediment which is very limited due to the high water table in the bay a radon based mass balance model based on a high resolution 222rn survey revealed shore normal discharges ranging from 3 1 m3 m d at the shore to 1 5 m3 m d these nearshore discharges agreed quite well with darcy fluxes calculated in the ste fresh inland groundwater makes up more than 50 of the total discharge suggesting that boreal sandy beaches are important sources of freshwater and potential paths of groundwater borne solutes to marine environments particularly in the snowmelt season this study demonstrated that it is crucial

7476,estimating the time required for water to travel through headwater catchments from where it recharges to where it discharges into streams the transit time is important for understanding catchment behaviour this study uses tritium 3h activities of stream water to estimate the mean transit times of water in the upper latrobe and yarra catchments southeast australia at different flow conditions the 3h activities of the stream water were between 1 26 and 1 99 tu which are lower than those of local rainfall 2 6 to 3 0 tu 3h activities in individual subcatchments are almost invariably lowest at low streamflows mean transit times calculated from the 3h activities using a range of lumped parameter models are between 7 and 62 years and are longest during low streamflows uncertainties in the estimated mean transit times result from uncertainties in the geometry of the flow systems uncertainties in the 3h input and macroscopic mixing in addition simulation of 3h activities in feflow indicates that heterogeneous hydraulic conductivities increase the range of mean transit times corresponding to a specific 3h activity the absolute uncertainties in the mean transit times may be up to 30 years however differences between mean transit times at different streamflows in the same catchment or between different subcatchments in the same area are more reliably estimated despite the uncertainties the conclusions that the mean transit times are years to decades and decrease with increasing streamflow are robust the seasonal variation in major ion geochemistry and 3h activities indicate that the higher general streamflows in winter are sustained by water displaced from shallower younger stores e g soils or regolith poor correlations between 3h activities and catchment area drainage density mean slope distance to stream and landuse imply that mean transit times are controlled by a variety of factors including the hydraulic properties of the soils and aquifers that are difficult to characterise spatially the long mean transit times imply that there are long lived stores of water in these catchments that may sustain streamflow over drought periods additionally there may be considerable delay in contaminants reaching the stream keywords catchments rivers tritium transit times tritium australia 1 introduction documenting the time that groundwater takes to flow through a catchment from the recharge area to where it discharges into the stream the transit time is important for understanding catchment behaviour mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 hrachowitz et al 2009a b soulsby et al 2009 mcdonnell et al 2010 stewart et al 2010 2012 duvert et al 2016 for example catchments with long transit times contain long lived stores of water that may sustain streamflow during droughts morgenstern et al 2010 cartwright and morgenstern 2015 in addition the mean transit time governs the time required for contaminated groundwater to reach the stream böhlke and michel 2009 stewart et al 2011 morgenstern et al 2015 soulsby et al 2015 due to high rainfall totals that commonly significantly exceed evapotranspiration rates and high runoff rates on indurated or crystalline rocks catchment headwaters may contribute a significant proportion of the total streamflow for many river systems headwater streams can provide much of the water that is eventually used downstream for human consumption recreation agriculture and or industry freeman et al 2007 while some headwater catchments retain native vegetation many now consist of plantation forests pastures crops and or urban developments the impact of such developments on headwater catchments is not always well understood replacement of native eucalypt vegetation with crops and grasses over the last 200 years in southeast australia had a profound impact on both groundwater and surface water systems allison et al 1990 the high transpiration rates of the native vegetation led to low groundwater recharge rates resulting in deep water tables recharge rates following land clearing are significantly higher allison et al 1990 cartwright et al 2007 which has caused the water table to rise and resulted in some former ephemeral streams becoming perennial lowland rivers are commonly hosted by sediments that contain large stores of groundwater that may make significant contributions to streamflow especially during low flow periods winter 1999 tetzlaff and soulsby 2008 cartwright et al 2011 2014 duvert et al 2016 by contrast headwater streams may occur on indurated or crystalline rocks that have limited groundwater systems the observation that many headwater streams are perennial and flow over prolonged dry periods indicates however that they receive water from the soils regolith or fractures rice and hornberger 1998 soulsby et al 2005 hrachowitz et al 2009a cartwright and morgenstern 2015 the locations and transit times of these water stores are commonly not well understood which hampers our understanding and management of headwater catchments 1 1 determining mean transit times water flowing through catchments follows flow paths of varying length and the water discharging into streams has a range of transit times governed by the geometry of the flow paths lumped parameter models which describe the distribution of water with different residence times in homogeneous aquifers with simplified geometries and uniform recharge rates are commonly used to estimate mean transit times of water sampled from aquifers or streams maloszewski and zuber 1982 cook and bohlke 2000 maloszewski 2000 mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 leray et al 2016 the radioactive isotope tritium 3h with a half life of 12 32 years may be used to estimate transit times where these are years to decades morgenstern et al 2010 3h is part of the water molecule and geochemical or biogeochemical reactions in the soils or aquifers do not affect its abundance consequently the calculated transit times reflect water flow through both the unsaturated zone and within the aquifer rainfall 3h activities peaked in the 1950 s to 1960 s due to the production of 3h in atmospheric thermonuclear tests the 3h bomb pulse the 3h activities of the remnant bomb pulse waters in the southern hemisphere have now largely decayed below those of modern rainfall which permits mean transit times to be estimated from individual 3h activities morgenstern et al 2010 however this approach requires that the lumped parameter models be assigned based on the known or assumed geometry of the flow system groundwater with high bomb pulse 3h activities is still present in the northern hemisphere and mean transit times may be estimated from lumped parameter models using time series of 3h activities maloszewski and zuber 1982 blavoux et al 2013 morgenstern et al 2015 while this increases the duration of the studies it does allow an assessment of the suitability of the lumped parameter model the reduction of bomb pulse 3h activities in the southern hemisphere make it impracticable to constrain lumped parameter models using future time series measurements cartwright and morgenstern 2016b while not being able to assess the form of the lumped parameter model introduces uncertainty the calculated mean transit times are far less sensitive to the choice of lumped parameter model than is the case for northern hemisphere catchments additionally this approach allows the changing mean transit times at different flow conditions to be estimated morgenstern et al 2010 duvert et al 2016 cartwright and morgenstern 2015 2016b further because the 3h activities of the remnant bomb pulse waters are below those of modern rainfall water with low 3h activities has longer mean transit times than water with high 3h activities permitting a robust assessment of relative mean transit times the pathways of groundwater inflows to a stream are potentially more complex than assumed in the lumped parameter models the aggregation of water from different flow systems potentially produces water samples with residence time distributions that do not correspond to those in the lumped parameter models mean transit times calculated from the aggregated waters are generally lower than the actual mean transit times suckow 2014 kirchner 2016 stewart et al 2017 lumped parameter models also assume that the aquifers are homogeneous however hydraulic conductivities are heterogeneous at a variety of scales due to weathering the presence of fractures and lithological variations similar to aggregation heterogeneities in hydraulic conductivity result in macroscopic dispersion that also may result in different 3h vs mean transit time relationships to those predicted by simple flow models weissmann et al 2002 mccallum et al 2014 mccallum et al 2015 1 2 controls on mean transit times identifying the controls on mean transit times is important for understanding catchment behaviour and for making first order predictions of mean transit times in unstudied catchments mean transit times are a function of recharge rates groundwater flow velocities and flow path lengths in southeast australia cleared catchments may have lower evapotranspiration and higher recharge rates and thus shorter mean transit times than those that retain native vegetation allison et al 1990 cartwright et al 2007 the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifers which in basement rocks is controlled by the degree of weathering and interconnectivity and transmissivity of fractures lachassagne et al 2011 also influences mean transit times the mobilisation of stores of water with different residence times e g soil waters water from the regolith or water in perched aquifer systems as the catchment wets up following rainfall also controls net mean transit times hrachowitz et al 2009a 2013 catchment geomorphology and geometry influences the length of the flow paths and hydraulic gradients e g mcguire et al 2005 mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 hrachowitz et al 2009b 2010 soulsby et al 2009 large catchments may have some long groundwater flow paths with long transit times catchments with higher drainage densities may contain numerous short groundwater flow paths and consequently have shorter mean transit times steeper catchments have higher hydraulic gradients that may lead to more rapid groundwater flow and shorter mean transit times there may be correlations between 3h activities and major ion concentrations or ratios that allow first order estimates of mean transit times to be made morgenstern et al 2010 cartwright and morgenstern 2015 2016a 2016b duvert et al 2016 beyer et al 2016 these correlations commonly stem from mineral dissolution reactions progressing further in older waters evapotranspiration also increases major ion concentrations especially in semi arid areas and catchments with high evapotranspiration rates are likely to have lower recharge rates and longer mean transit times catchments with high evapotranspiration rates are also likely to have lower runoff coefficients the percentage of rainfall that is exported annually by the stream and runoff coefficients may be a proxy for mean transit times cartwright and morgenstern 2015 1 3 objectives this paper estimates mean transit times at different streamflows in headwater streams from the latrobe and yarra catchments in southeast australia using 3h activities of stream water additionally it assesses whether catchment attributes such as drainage density catchment area landuse or slope control mean transit times the two catchments differ markedly in the extent of land clearing and it was hypothesised that this would result in different mean transit times further it explores whether there are geochemical proxies for 3h that can provide first order estimates of mean transit times in addition to assessing the uncertainties in mean transit times resulting from using different lumped parameter models aggregation uncertainties in the 3h input function it uses a numerical model to address the impact of heterogeneities in hydraulic conductivities on the estimated mean transit times while it is based on a specific area these themes are relevant to headwater catchments globally 2 study area 2 1 upper yarra catchment the upper yarra catchment drains the eastern slopes of the dandenong ranges in southeast victoria annual rainfall across the catchment averages 750 1000 mm and average annual evapotranspiration rates are 500 600 mm bureau of meteorology 2017 rainfall occurs throughout the year but is highest in the winter months when evapotranspiration rates are lowest this results in winter streamflows being higher than those in summer melbourne water 2017 the main streams are woori yallock creek wandin yallock creek and stringybark creek all of which are perennial tributaries of the yarra river fig 1 average streamflows are 6 3 107 m3 yr 1 in woori yallock creek 1 84 105 m3 yr 1 in wandin yallock creek and 3 7 106 m3 yr 1 in stringybark creek melbourne water 2014 the upper yarra catchment comprises a basement of indurated silurian devonian turbidites and granitic rocks including granites and extrusive rhyolites these rocks are overlain by thin devonian calcareous sandstones and tertiary basaltic volcanics van den berg 1975 energy and earth resources 2017 fig 1b thin deposits of recent alluvial sediments occur along some of the major streams weathering is variable across the catchment the basaltic volcanics commonly occur on the ridges and are weathered to depths of up to 50 m with kaolinite and montmorillonite common weathering products shugg 1996 tweed et al 2005 the turbidites and granites have weathered zones that are generally 5 m thick and which contain kaolinite and smectites as weathering products groundwater flow is hosted in fractures and the weathered zones of the indurated rocks and in the more permeable zones of the basalts shugg 1996 tweed et al 2005

are locally 1 m day 1 tweed et al 2005 the metasediments and granites in nearby areas have hydraulic conductivities of 0 001 1 m day 1 with the higher hydraulic conductivities occurring in weathered zones close to the land surface and zones of more intense fracturing van den berg and morand 1997 the hydraulic conductivity of the alluvial sediments are typically 0 2 5 m day 1 groundwater recharges

volcanics van den berg 1975 energy and earth resources 2017 thin deposits of recent alluvial sediments occur along the major streams relatively little is known about groundwater flow in this catchment however given the similarities in lithologies the hydraulic conductivities are likely to be similar to those in the upper yarra catchment weathering is deepest on the ridges and the metasediments and granites commonly have weathering zones that are a few metres thick van den berg 1975 groundwater recharges on the ridges and discharges into the latrobe river southern rural water 2014 by contrast with the upper yarra catchment the upper latrobe catchment is dominated by native eucalypt forest much of it in the alpine national park additionally there are plantation forests mainly along the loch valley and zones of mixed agriculture including dairying vineyards and grazing around noojee and willow grove there is minimal groundwater use in the upper latrobe catchment southern rural water 2014 3 methods 3 1 sampling and analytical techniques a one year aggregated rainfall sample was collected from a rainfall collector located at yarra junction which is close to the boundary between the two catchments fig 1a four rounds of stream samples were collected at varying flow conditions table a1 fig 2 from six sites in the upper latrobe catchment with areas ranging from 62 to 559 km2 and four sites in the upper yarra catchment with areas ranging from 9 to 325 km2 fig 1 sampling avoided the high streamflows that occur immediately following rainfall in order to characterise the average

exponential flow and 50 piston flow were used this model accords with the expected geometry of flow in the catchment vertical recharge through the unsaturated zone followed by flow along flow paths of varying length for the dispersion model values of dp of 0 1 and 1 were used which is the range generally adopted for kilometre scale flow systems maloszewski 2000 these lumped parameter models have successfully reproduced time series 3h activities of stream water elsewhere maloszewski and zuber 1982 blavoux et al 2013 morgenstern et al 2015 the annual average 3h activities of rainfall in melbourne tadros et al 2014 international atomic energy agency 2017 were used as the 3h input function rainfall 3h activities in melbourne peaked at approximately 62 tu in 1965 and then declined exponentially to present day values the calculations initially adopted a present day 3h activity of 2 8 tu based on the 3h activity of rainfall from yarra junction table a1 and the expected 3h activity of rainfall in this area tadros et al 2014 a 3h activity of 2 8 tu was also used for rainfall from the years before the atmospheric nuclear tests mean transit times were calculated by matching the measured 3h activity in the stream water with that predicted from the lumped parameter model 3 4 numerical modelling the lumped parameter models assume homogeneous aquifer properties that lead to a regular distribution of groundwater flow paths and mean transit times however most catchments have heterogeneous hydraulic conductivities weissmann et al 2002 mccallum et al 2014 mccallum et al 2015 two dimensional numerical simulations were performed using feflow diersch 2013 as described in supplement 2 the purpose of the modelling was not to simulate flow in these catchments but to explore the impact of heterogeneous hydraulic conductivities on mean transit times briefly the feflow model domain was 10 000 m in the longitudinal x direction and 25 m in the vertical z direction fig s1a the hydraulic boundary conditions were a constant flux at the top to simulate 50 mm yr 1 recharge and a constant head at the model outlet fig s1a all other boundaries are no flow boundaries while the geometry of the model resembles that of the exponential lumped parameter model solute transport models require a dispersivity be assigned for numerical stability a dispersivity of 0 5 m was used which results in dispersion in the numerical simulations being driven primarily by variations in k mccallum et al 2014 to assess the impacts of heterogeneous hydraulic conductivities the 3h activities and mean transit times from four sets of 30 simulations with an average k of 1 m day 1 and variances of k σ2ln k of 0 3 1 0 2 5 and 4 0 fig s2 were compared to a model with homogeneous k the feflow simulations used time steps of 5 days over 65 years from 1950 to 2015 the relatively short time step ensured model stability and minimised numerical dispersion both 3h activities and age were simulated as solutes the annual 3h activities of melbourne rainfall tadros et al 2014 interpolated onto the time steps of the model fig s1b were used as the 3h activity of recharge age was simulated by setting a constant age 0 years for the upper boundary and calculating the travel time to the model outlet for all simulations the mean age and mean 3h activity are the flux weighted arithmetic means at the model outlet 4 results 4 1 streamflow the variations of streamflow at noojee in the upper latrobe catchment are typical of streams in this region high streamflows are recorded in winter and lowest streamflows at the end of summer fig 2b the april 2015 and march 2016 samples represent the 82nd and 87th streamflow percentiles respectively between 1990 and 2016 fig 2a the august 2015 samples represent the 20th percentile of streamflow and the november 2015 samples the 65th percentile fig 2a runoff coefficients were estimated using streamflow records from between 1990 and 2016 where available department of environment land water and planning 2017 melbourne water 2017 for the tooronga river streamflow records between 1969 and 1986 which represents all available data for this site were used these multi year periods encompass several high rainfall and drought years bureau of meteorology 2017 allowing long term average runoff coefficients to be determined rainfall totals probably vary across the region and there is insufficient data to calculate the rainfall totals for each subcatchment hence it was assumed that the rainfall was between the minimum and maximum average annual values in the upper latrobe 1100 1400 mm and upper yarra catchments 750 1000 mm as a whole runoff coefficients range from 18 23 lower loch subcatchment to 40 53 stringybark subcatchment table 1 4 2 tritium activities the 3h activity of the rainfall sample from yarra junction is 2 76 tu which is within the expected range of average annual rainfall 3h activities in this region of 2 6 3 0 tu interpolated from the data of tadros et al 2014 fig 3 the 3h activity of the yarra junction rainfall is also similar to those of a 9 month rainfall sample from melbourne collected in july 2013 3h 2 72 tu and three 9 17 month rainfall samples from mount buffalo in northeast victoria 3h 2 8 2 99 tu cartwright and morgenstern 2015 2016a the 3h activities of the streams are between 1 26 and 1 99 tu fig 3 which are similar to 3h activities of headwater streams in northeast victoria 3h 1 6 2 5 tu cartwright and morgenstern 2015 2016a and central victoria 3h 0 2 2 9 tu cartwright and morgenstern 2016b howcroft et al 2017 in the two low streamflow sampling rounds april 2015 and march 2016 the streams from the upper yarra catchment have lower 3h activities median 1 44 tu mean 1 43 0 11 tu n 12 than those from the upper latrobe catchment median 1 55 tu mean 1 58 0 09 tu n 8 the p values from two tailed t tests are 0 004 implying that the difference between these two populations is significant beyond the 99 confidence interval the 3h activities in each of the subcatchments generally increase with increasing streamflow in the winter months fig 3a and b however even at the highest streamflows the 3h activities are invariably lower than the 3h activities of rainfall rather 3h activities of between 1 6 and 2 0 tu are reached at moderate streamflows but not subsequently exceeded 4 3 catchment attributes table 1 summarises catchment attributes derived from the gis data drainage densities are between 0 93 and 1 04 km km 2 and vary little either within or between the upper latrobe and upper yarra catchments likewise there is little systematic difference between the mean or maximum distances to the stream the upper yarra subcatchments have lower average slopes 12 15 than those in the upper latrobe catchment 24 27 there are also significant differences in the landuse between the two catchments in the upper latrobe subcatchments cleared land i e that which is not occupied by forest accounts for between 0 and 18 of the total area while in the upper yarra subcatchments it is between 85 and 99 4 4 ec and major ion geochemistry the ec of the upper yarra streams varies between 113 and 606 μs cm 1 table a1 the wandin yallock and stringybark streams have the highest ec values 373 606 and 323 472 μs cm 1 respectively the upper latrobe streams have ec values of 45 97 μs cm 1 and there is little difference between the subcatchments table a1 na is the most common cation in the stream water 62 91 of all cations on a molar basis with ca 3 15 mg 1 24 and k 1 11 present in lower abundances table a1 cl is the most abundant anion 81 98 on a molar basis of those that were measured table a1 however hco3 concentrations were not determined the rainfall sample from yarra junction has a na concentration of 1 2 mg l 1 and an ec value of 21 6 μs cm 1 table a1 figs 4 and 5 this is similar to non coastal rainfall elsewhere in southeast australia that has na concentrations of 1 2 mg l 1 and ec values of 15 30 μs cm 1 blackburn and mcleod 1983 crosbie et al 2012 cartwright et al 2014 cartwright and morgenstern 2015 2016a the ec values and major ion concentrations of rainfall are significantly lower than those of the river water at all streamflows table a1 figs 4 and 5 unlike catchments elsewhere in southeast australia cartwright and morgenstern 2015 2016a b howcroft et al 2017 major ion concentrations in most of the upper latrobe and yarra catchments do not vary systematically with streamflow or 3h activities table a1 figs 4 and 5 there is also little systematic variation in ec and streamflow collected as part of periodic stream salinity monitoring at noojee fig 4b the higher ec values at low streamflows probably reflect in stream evaporation during summer however generally the ec values vary between 40 and 80 μs cm 1 for streamflows that range over several orders of magnitude molar na cl ratios of the stream water vary from 0 6 to 1 3 with higher na cl ratios recorded in the waters with lower cl concentrations fig 6 a na cl ratios that are higher than those of local rainfall typically 0 8 1 1 reflect weathering of silicate minerals such as feldspar herczeg et al 2001 tweed et al 2005 cartwright and morgenstern 2015 2016a however the observation that na cl ratios do not far exceed those of rainfall implies that silicate dissolution is limited the na cl ratios of some more saline waters are lower than those of rainfall fig 6a which is probably due to na ca exchange on clay minerals tweed et al 2005 molar cl br ratios of 490 835 fig 6b span those of the oceans and rainfall in southeast australia but are far below those expected if halite or anthropogenic salts e g fertilisers had been dissolved herczeg et al 2001 cartwright et al 2006 overall as is the case throughout southeast australia allison et al 1990 herczeg et al 2001 tweed et al 2005 cartwright et al 2006 the variations in the salinity of the stream water is driven by differences in evapotranspiration with minor impacts of weathering and ion exchange this implies that the wandin yallock and stringybark catchments have higher degrees of evapotranspiration although given that they have similar geology vegetation and rainfall to the other upper yarra catchments the causes of this are not clear 4 5 modelled 3h activities the 3h activities at the outlet of the feflow model generally decrease with depth fig 7 which is a similar trend to that observed in the exponential lumped parameter model e g cook and bohlke 2000 jurgens et al 2012 not surprisingly the mean transit time of water correlates with the mean 3h activity at the model outlet fig 8 the geometry of the feflow model is similar to that of the exponential lumped parameter model however even for the homogeneous model the mean transit times at any given 3h activity predicted from the feflow model are longer fig 8 this is due to the feflow model incorporating dispersion which is not present in the exponential lumped parameter model the mean transit times at the model outlet decrease as σ2ln k increases the homogeneous model has a mean transit time of 72 years mean transit times for the other sets of simulations are 62 9 4 5 years for σ2ln k 0 3 54 2 9 1 years for σ2ln k 1 0 47 7 12 5 years for σ2ln k 2 5 and 50 5 13 years for σ2ln k 4 0 the decrease in mean transit times are due to the presence of interconnected high k pathways that become increasingly prevalent as σ2ln k increases the variability of mean transit times also increases with increasing σ2ln k for a 3h activity of 1 5 tu the range of mean transit times are 3 years for σ2ln k 0 3 increasing to 6 years for σ2ln k 4 0 for the whole range of simulations the range in mean transit times at 1 5 tu is 10 years fig 8 5 discussion the combination of major ion geochemistry streamflows 3h activities and catchment attributes allow aspects of the hydrogeology of the upper latrobe and upper yarra catchments to be understood this section addresses the prime objectives of the study namely the range of mean transit times whether mean transit times can be predicted from catchment attributes or geochemical data and the uncertainties in the calculated mean transit times 5 1 changing stores of water at different streamflows there is strong seasonality to southeast australian rainfall bureau of meteorology 2017 and streams are generally dominated by baseflow during summer cartwright et al 2014 thus baseflow probably contributes the vast majority of water to the streams in april 2015 and march 2016 when streamflows were low fig 2 higher winter streamflows can conceivably reflect the progressive mobilisation of shallower younger water stores e g soil water or water from the regolith as the catchment wets up c f hrachowitz et al 2013 or mixing between baseflow and recent rainfall this study avoided collecting samples during the high flow events immediately following rainfall when direct input of recent rainfall to the stream may occur the dilution of saline baseflow with recent rainfall also results in major ion concentrations or ec values being inversely correlated with streamflow godsey et al 2009 cartwright and morgenstern 2015 which is not observed in these catchments fig 4 the predicted ec vs streamflow trend for the situation where all the additional streamflows is derived from recent rainfall inputs also fails to replicate the observed ec values fig 4b rather as documented in similar catchments elsewhere in southeast australia the infiltrating rainfall has likely progressively mobilised the shallower stores of water from the soil or regolith cartwright and morgenstern 2015 howcroft et al 2017 these water stores almost certainly have shorter residence times than the deeper groundwater which explains why 3h activities are higher in winter given that samples were not collected over the high flow peaks the data does not preclude recent rainfall contributing to streamflow during individual high flow events 5 2 mean transit times based on the above conceptualisation of how the flow system responds to rainfall mean transit times were calculated assuming that single flow system contributes to the stream at all flow conditions if there were some inflow of recent rainfall this approach yields the minimum transit time of the baseflow component the estimated mean transit times calculated using the suite of lumped parameter models are between 7 and 62 years table 2 fig 9 the range of mean transit times from the various models increases with the 3h activity fig 9a however the relative difference decreases for example mean transit times for a water with a 3h activity of 2 tu are between 9 6 and 14 2 years or 19 for a water with a 3h activity of 1 5 tu they are between 28 0 and 41 9 years 13 for the two low streamflow sampling periods the mean transit times in the upper yarra subcatchments are 28 62 years april 2015 and 20 53 years march 2016 whereas the mean transit times in the upper latrobe subcatchments are 16 42 years april 2015 and 16 41 years march 2016 the tooronga river in the upper latrobe catchment has the shortest mean transit times 16 26 years and cockatoo creek in the upper yarra catchment has the longest mean transit times 42 62 years at the higher streamflows the mean transit times in the upper latrobe subcatchments are 7 24 years august 2015 and 13 36 years november 2015 at the corresponding times the mean transit times in the upper yarra subcatchments are 13 37 years august 2015 and 16 46 years november 2015 as at low streamflows the mean transit times are shortest in the tooronga river 9 13 years in august 2015 and 13 20 years in november 2015 and longest at cockatoo creek 26 37 years in august 2015 and 37 46 years in november 2015 5 3 uncertainties propagating the analytical uncertainty in 3h activities table a1 results in uncertainties in mean transit times of 1 2 years compared with the other uncertainties this has only a minor impact mixing of water with different mean transit times within a subcatchment aggregation results in calculated mean transit times being lower than the actual mean transit time suckow 2014 kirchner 2016 stewart et al 2017 the aggregation error is difficult to assess but it reduces as an increasing number of waters are mixed this is because flow systems where numerous aliquots of water with different mean transit times mix are similar to what is described by the lumped parameter models for example using similar lumped parameter models and input functions to this study cartwright and morgenstern 2016a estimated the aggregation error resulting from an equal mixture of two waters with mean transit times of 10 and 50 years was approximately 13 however if several waters with mean transit times of between 10 and 50 years mixed the aggregation errors were significantly lower the impacts of uncertainties in the 3h activities of rainfall may be illustrated using the exponential piston flow model with an epm ratio of 1 almost identical results are produced by the other models the assumed 3h activity of modern rainfall makes relatively little difference to the estimated mean transit time fig 9b varying the modern rainfall 3h activities between 2 6 and 3 0 tu which is the likely range of rainfall 3h activities in this region of southeast australia tadros et al 2014 produces a range of mean transit times of 3 years for a 3h activity of 2 tu and 0 1 year for a 3h activity of 1 5 tu uncertainties in the 3h activities of past rainfall exert a greater influence on the mean transit times fig 9c illustrates the impact of varying the 3h activity of rainfall by 10 which is approximately the relative uncertainty in modern rainfall 3h activities tadros et al 2014 for a 3h activity of 1 5 tu the range of mean transit times is approximately 13 5 years a relative uncertainty of 18 the calculations used average annual rainfall 3h activities as the input function however if summer rainfall is lost by evapotranspiration the 3h activities of the recharging water may be different morgenstern et al 2010 blavoux et al 2013 the monthly variation of 3h activities in melbourne international atomic energy agency 2017 are similar to those at kiatoke new zealand for which there is a more detailed record morgenstern et al 2010 the monthly variation in rainfall 3h activities in any given year is 1 tu and the 3h activities in summer rainfall are close to the average annual 3h activities this is also implied by the observation that the 3h activity of summer december to february rainfall at mount buffalo northeast victoria was closely similar 2 86 tu to that of two annual rainfall samples 2 99 and 2 85 tu cartwright and morgenstern 2015 with such a seasonal distribution of 3h activities the uncertainties resulting from using the average annual 3h activity are minor c f morgenstern et al 2010 the feflow simulations highlight another uncertainty in calculating mean transit times lumped parameter models have the advantage of not requiring a detailed knowledge of aquifer properties such as hydraulic conductivities that are difficult to obtain however it is highly unlikely in reality that hydraulic conductivities are homogeneous for aquifers with layers of different lithologies binary or higher order lumped parameter models may be used maloszewski and zuber 1982 maloszewski 2000 however the hydraulic conductivities are still likely to vary within each of the layers in the feflow simulations with highly heterogeneous hydraulic conductivities there is increasing variability in the relationship between mean transit times and 3h activities and the 3h activity vs depth profiles are irregular figs 7 and 8 the range of mean transit times estimated for a 3h activity of 1 5 tu in the feflow simulations is 10 years fig 8 this is a relative uncertainty of 13 which is similar to other uncertainties discussed above the feflow model includes dispersion which results in the mean transit times at any 3h activity being longer to those calculated from the lumped parameter models these differences highlight the uncertainties that stem from adopting lumped parameter models with simple geometries c f weissmann et al 2002 mccallum et al 2014 mccallum et al 2015 if uncertainties are uncorrelated and have gaussian distributions the overall uncertainty is the square root of the sum of the squares of the individual uncertainties the main uncertainties outlined above the choice of the lumped parameter model aggregation errors in the assumed 3h input and the presence of a heterogeneous hydrogeological conductivity are all approximately 15 which would imply an overall uncertainty in mean transit times of approximately 30 while this is considerable the conclusion that the mean transit times are years to decades long is still valid relative differences in mean transit times within or between catchments are more readily assessed the subcatchments may have flow paths with different geometries or different degrees of heterogeneity of hydraulic conductivity which affects the comparison of mean transit times between subcatchments however if the geometry of the flow paths in an individual subcatchment are similar during wetter and drier periods and the hydraulic conductivities do not change relative differences in mean transit times at different streamflows in the same subcatchment are more robustly calculated the 3h activities of rainfall are probably closely similar over areas the size of the study area e g tadros et al 2014 again this allows the relative differences in mean transit times at different streamflows in the same subcatchment to be more readily assessed by contrast aggregation may affect the comparison of mean transit times both between subcatchments and within the same subcatchment at different streamflows if different stores of water are mobilised 5 4 predicting mean transit times table 3 and fig 10 summarises correlation coefficients between catchment attributes table 1 and the 3h activities at the low streamflow conditions in april 2015 table a1 because 3h activities are directly related to mean transit times correlations between catchment attributes and mean transit times are similar correlation coefficients are considered to be strong at r2 0 75 moderate at 0 75 r2 0 5 and weak at r2 0 5 there are few strong correlations table 3 fig 10 the 3h activities and the runoff coefficient are weakly correlated r2 0 37 for the dataset as a whole but have moderate to strong correlations r2 0 65 0 90 within the two catchments slopes and 3h activities have a strong negative correlation in the upper yarra subcatchments r2 0 88 but have weak negative correlations r2 0 08 in the upper latrobe subcatchments and a week positive correlation r2 0 32 across the two catchments there is a weak negative correlation between the proportion of cleared land and 3h activities r2 0 46 in the dataset as a whole and in the two individual catchments r2 0 1 0 27 drainage densities are weakly correlated with 3h activities both within r2 0 31 0 15 and across r2 0 03 the two catchments both the maximum and mean distances are have strong negative correlations with 3h activities in one of the catchments r2 0 75 and 0 81 but are not correlated across the two catchments r2 0 00 and 0 17 overall there are no strong correlations between most catchment attributes 3h activities that apply in both catchments or across the two catchments the correlation between runoff coefficients and 3h activities are stronger especially within the catchments the same range of factors that control the mean transit times probably control the runoff coefficient for example catchments with high evapotranspiration rates will have lower rates of recharge that result in longer mean transit times and lower runoff coefficients thus as is the case elsewhere in southeast australia cartwright and morgenstern 2015 the runoff coefficient may be a plausible proxy for mean transit times for streams in the same catchment there are multiple interacting factors that control the transmission of water through catchments e g as discussed by mcguire et al 2005 mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 soulsby et al 2009 hrachowitz et al 2009a 2009b 2010 2013 lachassagne et al 2011 in addition to the geomorphology and geometry of the catchments the hydraulic properties of the soils and underlying rocks together with variations in the degree of evapotranspiration are also important because clearing of eucalypt vegetation in southeast australia was commonly followed by an increase in recharge allison et al 1990 cartwright et al 2006 it was anticipated that the mean transit times in the cleared yarra catchment would be shorter than those in the latrobe catchment which is dominated by native forests however this was not observed other differences between the two catchments e g geology rainfall and possibly soil types may have more impact than differences in land use thus while land clearing may have reduced mean transit times in the yarra catchment this is not apparent by comparison with adjacent catchments in other catchments in southeast australia and elsewhere major ion concentrations may be used as a proxy for 3h activities morgenstern et al 2010 cartwright and morgenstern 2015 2016a b beyer et al 2016 howcroft et al 2017 the major ion concentrations in the upper latrobe subcatchments are generally lower than those in the yarra subcatchments which broadly reflects the differences in 3h activities in detail however major ion concentrations and 3h activities are poorly correlated e g fig 5 the lack of correlation may be due to different weathering reactions occurring at different localities in the catchments and evapotranspiration rates being spatially variable correlations within individual subcatchments at different streamflows are locally stronger for example r2 values for the correlation between na and 3h are up to 0 96 in the upper latrobe subcatchments and up to 0 72 in the upper yarra subcatchments this may allow the major ion geochemistry to be used as a proxy for 3h at different streamflows in individual subcatchments 6 summary and conclusions calculating precise mean transit times is difficult due to a range of uncertainties and characterising a catchment in sufficient detail to reduce some of these uncertainties would be difficult however estimating broad ranges of mean transit times is feasible additionally determining the variation in mean transit times at different streamflows within the same subcatchment is more easily achieved than comparing mean transit times between subcatchments the conclusion that the mean transit times at baseflow conditions are several years to decades in both the upper yarra and upper latrobe catchments is robust and is vital information for catchment management firstly it suggests that there is a long lived store of water in these catchments that can sustain streamflow during drought periods additionally the long mean transit times may result in considerable delay in contaminants reaching the streams via the groundwater in the yarra catchment agriculture local housing developments and small scale industries are potential sources of contaminants particularly nitrate that it was not possible to reliably predict 3h activities from individual catchment attributes including a major difference in landuse or the major ion geochemistry limits our ability to make first order predictions of mean transit times in similar catchments or at different times the runoff coefficient which has proven to be a reasonable indicator of mean transit times elsewhere in southeast australia cartwright and morgenstern 2015 provided the most reliable prediction of mean transit times this is probably due to both the runoff coefficient and mean transit times reflecting recharge rates and rates of groundwater flow within the catchments mean transit times are likely controlled by the interaction of catchment attributes such as slope or drainage density the hydraulic properties of the soils regolith and aquifers and evapotranspiration rates characterising hydraulic properties or evapotranspiration across a whole catchment would be difficult and understanding how the various attributes combine to control mean transit times is also difficult the mean transit times in the upper yarra and latrobe catchments are years to decades similar mean transit times are documented elsewhere in australia cartwright and morgenstern 2015 2016a 2016b duvert et al 2016 howcroft et al 2017 and new zealand morgenstern et al 2015 however mean transit times in catchments elsewhere appear to be only a few years e g mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 hrachowitz et al 2009a b speed et al 2010 it is not clear whether the differences in mean transit times relates to differences in climate depth of weathering vegetation types soil properties or relief this together with the challenge in predicting mean transit times

7476,estimating the time required for water to travel through headwater catchments from where it recharges to where it discharges into streams the transit time is important for understanding catchment behaviour this study uses tritium 3h activities of stream water to estimate the mean transit times of water in the upper latrobe and yarra catchments southeast australia at different flow conditions the 3h activities of the stream water were between 1 26 and 1 99 tu which are lower than those of local rainfall 2 6 to 3 0 tu 3h activities in individual subcatchments are almost invariably lowest at low streamflows mean transit times calculated from the 3h activities using a range of lumped parameter models are between 7 and 62 years and are longest during low streamflows uncertainties in the estimated mean transit times result from uncertainties in the geometry of the flow systems uncertainties in the 3h input and macroscopic mixing in addition simulation of 3h activities in feflow indicates that heterogeneous hydraulic conductivities increase the range of mean transit times corresponding to a specific 3h activity the absolute uncertainties in the mean transit times may be up to 30 years however differences between mean transit times at different streamflows in the same catchment or between different subcatchments in the same area are more reliably estimated despite the uncertainties the conclusions that the mean transit times are years to decades and decrease with increasing streamflow are robust the seasonal variation in major ion geochemistry and 3h activities indicate that the higher general streamflows in winter are sustained by water displaced from shallower younger stores e g soils or regolith poor correlations between 3h activities and catchment area drainage density mean slope distance to stream and landuse imply that mean transit times are controlled by a variety of factors including the hydraulic properties of the soils and aquifers that are difficult to characterise spatially the long mean transit times imply that there are long lived stores of water in these catchments that may sustain streamflow over drought periods additionally there may be considerable delay in contaminants reaching the stream keywords catchments rivers tritium transit times tritium australia 1 introduction documenting the time that groundwater takes to flow through a catchment from the recharge area to where it discharges into the stream the transit time is important for understanding catchment behaviour mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 hrachowitz et al 2009a b soulsby et al 2009 mcdonnell et al 2010 stewart et al 2010 2012 duvert et al 2016 for example catchments with long transit times contain long lived stores of water that may sustain streamflow during droughts morgenstern et al 2010 cartwright and morgenstern 2015 in addition the mean transit time governs the time required for contaminated groundwater to reach the stream böhlke and michel 2009 stewart et al 2011 morgenstern et al 2015 soulsby et al 2015 due to high rainfall totals that commonly significantly exceed evapotranspiration rates and high runoff rates on indurated or crystalline rocks catchment headwaters may contribute a significant proportion of the total streamflow for many river systems headwater streams can provide much of the water that is eventually used downstream for human consumption recreation agriculture and or industry freeman et al 2007 while some headwater catchments retain native vegetation many now consist of plantation forests pastures crops and or urban developments the impact of such developments on headwater catchments is not always well understood replacement of native eucalypt vegetation with crops and grasses over the last 200 years in southeast australia had a profound impact on both groundwater and surface water systems allison et al 1990 the high transpiration rates of the native vegetation led to low groundwater recharge rates resulting in deep water tables recharge rates following land clearing are significantly higher allison et al 1990 cartwright et al 2007 which has caused the water table to rise and resulted in some former ephemeral streams becoming perennial lowland rivers are commonly hosted by sediments that contain large stores of groundwater that may make significant contributions to streamflow especially during low flow periods winter 1999 tetzlaff and soulsby 2008 cartwright et al 2011 2014 duvert et al 2016 by contrast headwater streams may occur on indurated or crystalline rocks that have limited groundwater systems the observation that many headwater streams are perennial and flow over prolonged dry periods indicates however that they receive water from the soils regolith or fractures rice and hornberger 1998 soulsby et al 2005 hrachowitz et al 2009a cartwright and morgenstern 2015 the locations and transit times of these water stores are commonly not well understood which hampers our understanding and management of headwater catchments 1 1 determining mean transit times water flowing through catchments follows flow paths of varying length and the water discharging into streams has a range of transit times governed by the geometry of the flow paths lumped parameter models which describe the distribution of water with different residence times in homogeneous aquifers with simplified geometries and uniform recharge rates are commonly used to estimate mean transit times of water sampled from aquifers or streams maloszewski and zuber 1982 cook and bohlke 2000 maloszewski 2000 mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 leray et al 2016 the radioactive isotope tritium 3h with a half life of 12 32 years may be used to estimate transit times where these are years to decades morgenstern et al 2010 3h is part of the water molecule and geochemical or biogeochemical reactions in the soils or aquifers do not affect its abundance consequently the calculated transit times reflect water flow through both the unsaturated zone and within the aquifer rainfall 3h activities peaked in the 1950 s to 1960 s due to the production of 3h in atmospheric thermonuclear tests the 3h bomb pulse the 3h activities of the remnant bomb pulse waters in the southern hemisphere have now largely decayed below those of modern rainfall which permits mean transit times to be estimated from individual 3h activities morgenstern et al 2010 however this approach requires that the lumped parameter models be assigned based on the known or assumed geometry of the flow system groundwater with high bomb pulse 3h activities is still present in the northern hemisphere and mean transit times may be estimated from lumped parameter models using time series of 3h activities maloszewski and zuber 1982 blavoux et al 2013 morgenstern et al 2015 while this increases the duration of the studies it does allow an assessment of the suitability of the lumped parameter model the reduction of bomb pulse 3h activities in the southern hemisphere make it impracticable to constrain lumped parameter models using future time series measurements cartwright and morgenstern 2016b while not being able to assess the form of the lumped parameter model introduces uncertainty the calculated mean transit times are far less sensitive to the choice of lumped parameter model than is the case for northern hemisphere catchments additionally this approach allows the changing mean transit times at different flow conditions to be estimated morgenstern et al 2010 duvert et al 2016 cartwright and morgenstern 2015 2016b further because the 3h activities of the remnant bomb pulse waters are below those of modern rainfall water with low 3h activities has longer mean transit times than water with high 3h activities permitting a robust assessment of relative mean transit times the pathways of groundwater inflows to a stream are potentially more complex than assumed in the lumped parameter models the aggregation of water from different flow systems potentially produces water samples with residence time distributions that do not correspond to those in the lumped parameter models mean transit times calculated from the aggregated waters are generally lower than the actual mean transit times suckow 2014 kirchner 2016 stewart et al 2017 lumped parameter models also assume that the aquifers are homogeneous however hydraulic conductivities are heterogeneous at a variety of scales due to weathering the presence of fractures and lithological variations similar to aggregation heterogeneities in hydraulic conductivity result in macroscopic dispersion that also may result in different 3h vs mean transit time relationships to those predicted by simple flow models weissmann et al 2002 mccallum et al 2014 mccallum et al 2015 1 2 controls on mean transit times identifying the controls on mean transit times is important for understanding catchment behaviour and for making first order predictions of mean transit times in unstudied catchments mean transit times are a function of recharge rates groundwater flow velocities and flow path lengths in southeast australia cleared catchments may have lower evapotranspiration and higher recharge rates and thus shorter mean transit times than those that retain native vegetation allison et al 1990 cartwright et al 2007 the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifers which in basement rocks is controlled by the degree of weathering and interconnectivity and transmissivity of fractures lachassagne et al 2011 also influences mean transit times the mobilisation of stores of water with different residence times e g soil waters water from the regolith or water in perched aquifer systems as the catchment wets up following rainfall also controls net mean transit times hrachowitz et al 2009a 2013 catchment geomorphology and geometry influences the length of the flow paths and hydraulic gradients e g mcguire et al 2005 mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 hrachowitz et al 2009b 2010 soulsby et al 2009 large catchments may have some long groundwater flow paths with long transit times catchments with higher drainage densities may contain numerous short groundwater flow paths and consequently have shorter mean transit times steeper catchments have higher hydraulic gradients that may lead to more rapid groundwater flow and shorter mean transit times there may be correlations between 3h activities and major ion concentrations or ratios that allow first order estimates of mean transit times to be made morgenstern et al 2010 cartwright and morgenstern 2015 2016a 2016b duvert et al 2016 beyer et al 2016 these correlations commonly stem from mineral dissolution reactions progressing further in older waters evapotranspiration also increases major ion concentrations especially in semi arid areas and catchments with high evapotranspiration rates are likely to have lower recharge rates and longer mean transit times catchments with high evapotranspiration rates are also likely to have lower runoff coefficients the percentage of rainfall that is exported annually by the stream and runoff coefficients may be a proxy for mean transit times cartwright and morgenstern 2015 1 3 objectives this paper estimates mean transit times at different streamflows in headwater streams from the latrobe and yarra catchments in southeast australia using 3h activities of stream water additionally it assesses whether catchment attributes such as drainage density catchment area landuse or slope control mean transit times the two catchments differ markedly in the extent of land clearing and it was hypothesised that this would result in different mean transit times further it explores whether there are geochemical proxies for 3h that can provide first order estimates of mean transit times in addition to assessing the uncertainties in mean transit times resulting from using different lumped parameter models aggregation uncertainties in the 3h input function it uses a numerical model to address the impact of heterogeneities in hydraulic conductivities on the estimated mean transit times while it is based on a specific area these themes are relevant to headwater catchments globally 2 study area 2 1 upper yarra catchment the upper yarra catchment drains the eastern slopes of the dandenong ranges in southeast victoria annual rainfall across the catchment averages 750 1000 mm and average annual evapotranspiration rates are 500 600 mm bureau of meteorology 2017 rainfall occurs throughout the year but is highest in the winter months when evapotranspiration rates are lowest this results in winter streamflows being higher than those in summer melbourne water 2017 the main streams are woori yallock creek wandin yallock creek and stringybark creek all of which are perennial tributaries of the yarra river fig 1 average streamflows are 6 3 107 m3 yr 1 in woori yallock creek 1 84 105 m3 yr 1 in wandin yallock creek and 3 7 106 m3 yr 1 in stringybark creek melbourne water 2014 the upper yarra catchment comprises a basement of indurated silurian devonian turbidites and granitic rocks including granites and extrusive rhyolites these rocks are overlain by thin devonian calcareous sandstones and tertiary basaltic volcanics van den berg 1975 energy and earth resources 2017 fig 1b thin deposits of recent alluvial sediments occur along some of the major streams weathering is variable across the catchment the basaltic volcanics commonly occur on the ridges and are weathered to depths of up to 50 m with kaolinite and montmorillonite common weathering products shugg 1996 tweed et al 2005 the turbidites and granites have weathered zones that are generally 5 m thick and which contain kaolinite and smectites as weathering products groundwater flow is hosted in fractures and the weathered zones of the indurated rocks and in the more permeable zones of the basalts shugg 1996 tweed et al 2005 horizontal hydraulic conductivities in the unweathered basalts are 0 3 m day 1 shugg 1996 but based on the distribution of groundwater residence times hydraulic conductivities in the weathered zones are locally 1 m day 1 tweed et al 2005 the metasediments and granites in nearby areas have hydraulic conductivities of 0 001 1 m day 1 with the higher hydraulic conductivities occurring in weathered zones close to the land surface and zones of more intense fracturing van den berg and morand 1997 the hydraulic conductivity of the alluvial sediments are typically 0 2 5 m day 1 groundwater recharges on the ridges and discharges into the lower reaches of many of the rivers tweed et al 2005 approximately 84 of this part of the upper yarra catchment has been cleared current landuse includes dairying horticulture vineyards and grazing and a significant amount of low density urban developments melbourne water 2014 there is an annual water allocation of 9 5 106 m3 from woori yallock creek approximately 15 of annual streamflow although 30 of this allocation is typically used melbourne water 2014 2 2 upper latrobe catchment the headwaters of the latrobe catchment drain the southern slopes of the yarra ranges fig 1 the upper latrobe catchment has an average annual rainfall of between 1100 and 1400 mm and average annual evapotranspiration rates are 500 600 mm bureau of meteorology 2017 the upper latrobe river is perennial and the upper catchment includes the loch and tooronga rivers that join the latrobe river near noojee the total catchment area upstream of the lowermost sampling site at willow grove is 559 km2 and the long term average streamflow of the latrobe river at willow grove is 108 m3 yr 1 department of environment land water and planning 2017 as with the yarra catchment streamflows in the upper latrobe catchment are higher in winter e g fig 2 granites granodiorites and metamorphosed silurian devonian turbidites which again host groundwater flow mainly in weathered zones and fractures dominate the north of the upper latrobe catchment fig 1b the south of the catchment also includes coarse grained pliocene sands and gravels minor granites and basaltic volcanics van den berg 1975 energy and earth resources 2017 thin deposits of recent alluvial sediments occur along the major streams relatively little is known about groundwater flow in this catchment however given the similarities in lithologies the hydraulic conductivities are likely to be similar to those in the upper yarra catchment weathering is deepest on the ridges and the metasediments and granites commonly have weathering zones that are a few metres thick van den berg 1975 groundwater recharges on the ridges and discharges into the latrobe river southern rural water 2014 by contrast with the upper yarra catchment the upper latrobe catchment is dominated by native eucalypt forest much of it in the alpine national park additionally there are plantation forests mainly along the loch valley and zones of mixed agriculture including dairying vineyards and grazing around noojee and willow grove there is minimal groundwater use in the upper latrobe catchment southern rural water 2014 3 methods 3 1 sampling and analytical techniques a one year aggregated rainfall sample was collected from a rainfall collector located at yarra junction which is close to the boundary between the two catchments fig 1a four rounds of stream samples were collected at varying flow conditions table a1 fig 2 from six sites in the upper latrobe catchment with areas ranging from 62 to 559 km2 and four sites in the upper yarra catchment with areas ranging from 9 to 325 km2 fig 1 sampling avoided the high streamflows that occur immediately following rainfall in order to characterise the average seasonal flows fig 2 april 2015 and march 2016 represent low flow conditions at the end of the austral summer august 2015 represents high winter flows and november 2015 represents intermediate spring flows sub daily streamflows are measured at the willow grove noojee lower loch and gentle annie sites in the upper latrobe catchment and the stringybark woori yallock wandin yallock and cockatoo sites in the upper yarra catchment department of environment land water and planning 2017 melbourne water 2017 electrical conductivity ec was measured in the field using a calibrated tps meter and electrodes cation concentrations were measured at monash university using a thermo fischer icp oes on samples that had been filtered through 0 45 µm cellulose nitrate filters and acidified to ph 2 using double distilled 16 m hno3 anion concentrations were measured at monash university on filtered unacidified samples using a thermo fischer ion chromatograph geochemical data is presented in table a1 in supplement 1 the precision of anion and cation analyses based on replicate analyses is 2 and the accuracy based on analysis of certified water standards is 5 3h activities were measured at gns following morgenstern and taylor 2009 following vacuum distillation and electrolytic enrichment 3h activities were determined using liquid scintillation in quantulus ultra low level counters tritium enrichment was by a factor of 95 which yields a detection limit of 0 02 tu deuterium calibration of each sample ensures reproducibility of tritium enrichment of 1 3h activities are expressed in tritium units tu where 1 tu represents a 3h 1h ratio of 1 10 18 relative precision 1σ of individual analyses are 1 5 2 5 table a1 3 2 catchment attributes catchment attributes were estimated using arcgis 10 esri and datasets from victoria open data 2016 the hydrology modelling tools were used to generate the stream network from a 10 m digital elevation model fig 1c a threshold catchment area of 50 ha reproduces the observed perennial stream network of the area subcatchment areas upstream of each sampling site were calculated using the watershed tool and drainage densities calculated as the total stream length in each subcatchment divided by the subcatchment area mean slopes and the mean and maximum distance to the stream were calculated using the spatial analysis tools vector based landuse datasets were converted to raster formats and reclassified landuse was assigned as forest includes native vegetation and some plantations and cleared land which includes urban and mixed agricultural regions pasture horticulture and crops 3 3 mean transit times mean transit times were calculated using the exponential exponential piston flow and dispersion lumped parameter models implemented in the tracerlpm excel workbook jurgens et al 2012 as described in supplement 2 for the exponential piston flow models epm ratios of 0 33 75 exponential flow and 25 piston flow and 1 50 exponential flow and 50 piston flow were used this model accords with the expected geometry of flow in the catchment vertical recharge through the unsaturated zone followed by flow along flow paths of varying length for the dispersion model values of dp of 0 1 and 1 were used which is the range generally adopted for kilometre scale flow systems maloszewski 2000 these lumped parameter models have successfully reproduced time series 3h activities of stream water elsewhere maloszewski and zuber 1982 blavoux et al 2013 morgenstern et al 2015 the annual average 3h activities of rainfall in melbourne tadros et al 2014 international atomic energy agency 2017 were used as the 3h input function rainfall 3h activities in melbourne peaked at approximately 62 tu in 1965 and then declined exponentially to present day values the calculations initially adopted a present day 3h activity of 2 8 tu based on the 3h activity of rainfall from yarra junction table a1 and the expected 3h activity of rainfall in this area tadros et al 2014 a 3h activity of 2 8 tu was also used for rainfall from the years before the atmospheric nuclear tests mean transit times were calculated by matching the measured 3h activity in the stream water with that predicted from the lumped parameter model 3 4 numerical modelling the lumped parameter models assume homogeneous aquifer properties that lead to a regular distribution of groundwater flow paths and mean transit times however most catchments have heterogeneous hydraulic conductivities weissmann et al 2002 mccallum et al 2014 mccallum et al 2015 two dimensional numerical simulations were performed using feflow diersch 2013 as described in supplement 2 the purpose of the modelling was not to simulate flow in these catchments but to explore the impact of heterogeneous hydraulic conductivities on mean transit times briefly the feflow model domain was 10 000 m in the longitudinal x direction and 25 m in the vertical z direction fig s1a the hydraulic boundary conditions were a constant flux at the top to simulate 50 mm yr 1 recharge and a constant head at the model outlet fig s1a all other boundaries are no flow boundaries while the geometry of the model resembles that of the exponential lumped parameter model solute transport models require a dispersivity be assigned for numerical stability a dispersivity of 0 5 m was used which results in dispersion in the numerical simulations being driven primarily by variations in k mccallum et al 2014 to assess the impacts of heterogeneous hydraulic conductivities the 3h activities and mean transit times from four sets of 30 simulations with an average k of 1 m day 1 and variances of k σ2ln k of 0 3 1 0 2 5 and 4 0 fig s2 were compared to a model with homogeneous k the feflow simulations used time steps of 5 days over 65 years from 1950 to 2015 the relatively short time step ensured model stability and minimised numerical dispersion both 3h activities and age were simulated as solutes the annual 3h activities of melbourne rainfall tadros et al 2014 interpolated onto the time steps of the model fig s1b were used as the 3h activity of recharge age was simulated by setting a constant age 0 years for the upper boundary and calculating the travel time to the model outlet for all simulations the mean age and mean 3h activity are the flux weighted arithmetic means at the model outlet 4 results 4 1 streamflow the variations of streamflow at noojee in the upper latrobe catchment are typical of streams in this region high streamflows are recorded in winter and lowest streamflows at the end of summer fig 2b the april 2015 and march 2016 samples represent the 82nd and 87th streamflow percentiles respectively between 1990 and 2016 fig 2a the august 2015 samples represent the 20th percentile of streamflow and the november 2015 samples the 65th percentile fig 2a runoff coefficients were estimated using streamflow records from between 1990 and 2016 where available department of environment land water and planning 2017 melbourne water 2017 for the tooronga river streamflow records between 1969 and 1986 which represents all available data for this site were used these multi year periods encompass several high rainfall and drought years bureau of meteorology 2017 allowing long term average runoff coefficients to be determined rainfall totals probably vary across the region and there is insufficient data to calculate the rainfall totals for each subcatchment hence it was assumed that the rainfall was between the minimum and maximum average annual values in the upper latrobe 1100 1400 mm and upper yarra catchments 750 1000 mm as a whole runoff coefficients range from 18 23 lower loch subcatchment to 40 53 stringybark subcatchment table 1 4 2 tritium activities the 3h activity of the rainfall sample from yarra junction is 2 76 tu which is within the expected range of average annual rainfall 3h activities in this region of 2 6 3 0 tu interpolated from the data of tadros et al 2014 fig 3 the 3h activity of the yarra junction rainfall is also similar to those of a 9 month rainfall sample from melbourne collected in july 2013 3h 2 72 tu and three 9 17 month rainfall samples from mount buffalo in northeast victoria 3h 2 8 2 99 tu cartwright and morgenstern 2015 2016a the 3h activities of the streams are between 1 26 and 1 99 tu fig 3 which are similar to 3h activities of headwater streams in northeast victoria 3h 1 6 2 5 tu cartwright and morgenstern 2015 2016a and central victoria 3h 0 2 2 9 tu cartwright and morgenstern 2016b howcroft et al 2017 in the two low streamflow sampling rounds april 2015 and march 2016 the streams from the upper yarra catchment have lower 3h activities median 1 44 tu mean 1 43 0 11 tu n 12 than those from the upper latrobe catchment median 1 55 tu mean 1 58 0 09 tu n 8 the p values from two tailed t tests are 0 004 implying that the difference between these two populations is significant beyond the 99 confidence interval the 3h activities in each of the subcatchments generally increase with increasing streamflow in the winter months fig 3a and b however even at the highest streamflows the 3h activities are invariably lower than the 3h activities of rainfall rather 3h activities of between 1 6 and 2 0 tu are reached at moderate streamflows but not subsequently exceeded 4 3 catchment attributes table 1 summarises catchment attributes derived from the gis data drainage densities are between 0 93 and 1 04 km km 2 and vary little either within or between the upper latrobe and upper yarra catchments likewise there is little systematic difference between the mean or maximum distances to the stream the upper yarra subcatchments have lower average slopes 12 15 than those in the upper latrobe catchment 24 27 there are also significant differences in the landuse between the two catchments in the upper latrobe subcatchments cleared land i e that which is not occupied by forest accounts for between 0 and 18 of the total area while in the upper yarra subcatchments it is between 85 and 99 4 4 ec and major ion geochemistry the ec of the upper yarra streams varies between 113 and 606 μs cm 1 table a1 the wandin yallock and stringybark streams have the highest ec values 373 606 and 323 472 μs cm 1 respectively the upper latrobe streams have ec values of 45 97 μs cm 1 and there is little difference between the subcatchments table a1 na is the most common cation in the stream water 62 91 of all cations on a molar basis with ca 3 15 mg 1 24 and k 1 11 present in lower abundances table a1 cl is the most abundant anion 81 98 on a molar basis of those that were measured table a1 however hco3 concentrations were not determined the rainfall sample from yarra junction has a na concentration of 1 2 mg l 1 and an ec value of 21 6 μs cm 1 table a1 figs 4 and 5 this is similar to non coastal rainfall elsewhere in southeast australia that has na concentrations of 1 2 mg l 1 and ec values of 15 30 μs cm 1 blackburn and mcleod 1983 crosbie et al 2012 cartwright et al 2014 cartwright and morgenstern 2015 2016a the ec values and major ion concentrations of rainfall are significantly lower than those of the river water at all streamflows table a1 figs 4 and 5 unlike catchments elsewhere in southeast australia cartwright and morgenstern 2015 2016a b howcroft et al 2017 major ion concentrations in most of the upper latrobe and yarra catchments do not vary systematically with streamflow or 3h activities table a1 figs 4 and 5 there is also little systematic variation in ec and streamflow collected as part of periodic stream salinity monitoring at noojee fig 4b the higher ec values at low streamflows probably reflect in stream evaporation during summer however generally the ec values vary between 40 and 80 μs cm 1 for streamflows that range over several orders of magnitude molar na cl ratios of the stream water vary from 0 6 to 1 3 with higher na cl ratios recorded in the waters with lower cl concentrations fig 6 a na cl ratios that are higher than those of local rainfall typically 0 8 1 1 reflect weathering of silicate minerals such as feldspar herczeg et al 2001 tweed et al 2005 cartwright and morgenstern 2015 2016a however the observation that na cl ratios do not far exceed those of rainfall implies that silicate dissolution is limited the na cl ratios of some more saline waters are lower than those of rainfall fig 6a which is probably due to na ca exchange on clay minerals tweed et al 2005 molar cl br ratios of 490 835 fig 6b span those of the oceans and rainfall in southeast australia but are far below those expected if halite or anthropogenic salts e g fertilisers had been dissolved herczeg et al 2001 cartwright et al 2006 overall as is the case throughout southeast australia allison et al 1990 herczeg et al 2001 tweed et al 2005 cartwright et al 2006 the variations in the salinity of the stream water is driven by differences in evapotranspiration with minor impacts of weathering and ion exchange this implies that the wandin yallock and stringybark catchments have higher degrees of evapotranspiration although given that they have similar geology vegetation and rainfall to the other upper yarra catchments the causes of this are not clear 4 5 modelled 3h activities the 3h activities at the outlet of the feflow model generally decrease with depth fig 7 which is a similar trend to that observed in the exponential lumped parameter model e g cook and bohlke 2000 jurgens et al 2012 not surprisingly the mean transit time of water correlates with the mean 3h activity at the model outlet fig 8 the geometry of the feflow model is similar to that of the exponential lumped parameter model however even for the homogeneous model the mean transit times at any given 3h activity predicted from the feflow model are longer fig 8 this is due to the feflow model incorporating dispersion which is not present in the exponential lumped parameter model the mean transit times at the model outlet decrease as σ2ln k increases the homogeneous model has a mean transit time of 72 years mean transit times for the other sets of simulations are 62 9 4 5 years for σ2ln k 0 3 54 2 9 1 years for σ2ln k 1 0 47 7 12 5 years for σ2ln k 2 5 and 50 5 13 years for σ2ln k 4 0 the decrease in mean transit times are due to the presence of interconnected high k pathways that become increasingly prevalent as σ2ln k increases the variability of mean transit times also increases with increasing σ2ln k for a 3h activity of 1 5 tu the range of mean transit times are 3 years for σ2ln k 0 3 increasing to 6 years for σ2ln k 4 0 for the whole range of simulations the range in mean transit times at 1 5 tu is 10 years fig 8 5 discussion the combination of major ion geochemistry streamflows 3h activities and catchment attributes allow aspects of the hydrogeology of the upper latrobe and upper yarra catchments to be understood this section addresses the prime objectives of the study namely the range of mean transit times whether mean transit times can be predicted from catchment attributes or geochemical data and the uncertainties in the calculated mean transit times 5 1 changing stores of water at different streamflows there is strong seasonality to southeast australian rainfall bureau of meteorology 2017 and streams are generally dominated by baseflow during summer cartwright et al 2014 thus baseflow probably contributes the vast majority of water to the streams in april 2015 and march 2016 when streamflows were low fig 2 higher winter streamflows can conceivably reflect the progressive mobilisation of shallower younger water stores e g soil water or water from the regolith as the catchment wets up c f hrachowitz et al 2013 or mixing between baseflow and recent rainfall this study avoided collecting samples during the high flow events immediately following rainfall when direct input of recent rainfall to the stream may occur the dilution of saline baseflow with recent rainfall also results in major ion concentrations or ec values being inversely correlated with streamflow godsey et al 2009 cartwright and morgenstern 2015 which is not observed in these catchments fig 4 the predicted ec vs streamflow trend for the situation where all the additional streamflows is derived from recent rainfall inputs also fails to replicate the observed ec values fig 4b rather as documented in similar catchments elsewhere in southeast australia the infiltrating rainfall has likely progressively mobilised the shallower stores of water from the soil or regolith cartwright and morgenstern 2015 howcroft et al 2017 these water stores almost certainly have shorter residence times than the deeper groundwater which explains why 3h activities are higher in winter given that samples were not collected over the high flow peaks the data does not preclude recent rainfall contributing to streamflow during individual high flow events 5 2 mean transit times based on the above conceptualisation of how the flow system responds to rainfall mean transit times were calculated assuming that single flow system contributes to the stream at all flow conditions if there were some inflow of recent rainfall this approach yields the minimum transit time of the baseflow component the estimated mean transit times calculated using the suite of lumped parameter models are between 7 and 62 years table 2 fig 9 the range of mean transit times from the various models increases with the 3h activity fig 9a however the relative difference decreases for example mean transit times for a water with a 3h activity of 2 tu are between 9 6 and 14 2 years or 19 for a water with a 3h activity of 1 5 tu they are between 28 0 and 41 9 years 13 for the two low streamflow sampling periods the mean transit times in the upper yarra subcatchments are 28 62 years april 2015 and 20 53 years march 2016 whereas the mean transit times in the upper latrobe subcatchments are 16 42 years april 2015 and 16 41 years march 2016 the tooronga river in the upper latrobe catchment has the shortest mean transit times 16 26 years and cockatoo creek in the upper yarra catchment has the longest mean transit times 42 62 years at the higher streamflows the mean transit times in the upper latrobe subcatchments are 7 24 years august 2015 and 13 36 years november 2015 at the corresponding times the mean transit times in the upper yarra subcatchments are 13 37 years august 2015 and 16 46 years november 2015 as at low streamflows the mean transit times are shortest in the tooronga river 9 13 years in august 2015 and 13 20 years in november 2015 and longest at cockatoo creek 26 37 years in august 2015 and 37 46 years in november 2015 5 3 uncertainties propagating the analytical uncertainty in 3h activities table a1 results in uncertainties in mean transit times of 1 2 years compared with the other uncertainties this has only a minor impact mixing of water with different mean transit times within a subcatchment aggregation results in calculated mean transit times being lower than the actual mean transit time suckow 2014 kirchner 2016 stewart et al 2017 the aggregation error is difficult to assess but it reduces as an increasing number of waters are mixed this is because flow systems where numerous aliquots of water with different mean transit times mix are similar to what is described by the lumped parameter models for example using similar lumped parameter models and input functions to this study cartwright and morgenstern 2016a estimated the aggregation error resulting from an equal mixture of two waters with mean transit times of 10 and 50 years was approximately 13 however if several waters with mean transit times of between 10 and 50 years mixed the aggregation errors were significantly lower the impacts of uncertainties in the 3h activities of rainfall may be illustrated using the exponential piston flow model with an epm ratio of 1 almost identical results are produced by the other models the assumed 3h activity of modern rainfall makes relatively little difference to the estimated mean transit time fig 9b varying the modern rainfall 3h activities between 2 6 and 3 0 tu which is the likely range of rainfall 3h activities in this region of southeast australia tadros et al 2014 produces a range of mean transit times of 3 years for a 3h activity of 2 tu and 0 1 year for a 3h activity of 1 5 tu uncertainties in the 3h activities of past rainfall exert a greater influence on the mean transit times fig 9c illustrates the impact of varying the 3h activity of rainfall by 10 which is approximately the relative uncertainty in modern rainfall 3h activities tadros et al 2014 for a 3h activity of 1 5 tu the range of mean transit times is approximately 13 5 years a relative uncertainty of 18 the calculations used average annual rainfall 3h activities as the input function however if summer rainfall is lost by evapotranspiration the 3h activities of the recharging water may be different morgenstern et al 2010 blavoux et al 2013 the monthly variation of 3h activities in melbourne international atomic energy agency 2017 are similar to those at kiatoke new zealand for which there is a more detailed record morgenstern et al 2010 the monthly variation in rainfall 3h activities in any given year is 1 tu and the 3h activities in summer rainfall are close to the average annual 3h activities this is also implied by the observation that the 3h activity of summer december to february rainfall at mount buffalo northeast victoria was closely similar 2 86 tu to that of two annual rainfall samples 2 99 and 2 85 tu cartwright and morgenstern 2015 with such a seasonal distribution of 3h activities the uncertainties resulting from using the average annual 3h activity are minor c f morgenstern et al 2010 the feflow simulations highlight another uncertainty in calculating mean transit times lumped parameter models have the advantage of not requiring a detailed knowledge of aquifer properties such as hydraulic conductivities that are difficult to obtain however it is highly unlikely in reality that hydraulic conductivities are homogeneous for aquifers with layers of different lithologies binary or higher order lumped parameter models may be used maloszewski and zuber 1982 maloszewski 2000 however the hydraulic conductivities are still likely to vary within each of the layers in the feflow simulations with highly heterogeneous hydraulic conductivities there is increasing variability in the relationship between mean transit times and 3h activities and the 3h activity vs depth profiles are irregular figs 7 and 8 the range of mean transit times estimated for a 3h activity of 1 5 tu in the feflow simulations is 10 years fig 8 this is a relative uncertainty of 13 which is similar to other uncertainties discussed above the feflow model includes dispersion which results in the mean transit times at any 3h activity being longer to those calculated from the lumped parameter models these differences highlight the uncertainties that stem from adopting lumped parameter models with simple geometries c f weissmann et al 2002 mccallum et al 2014 mccallum et al 2015 if uncertainties are uncorrelated and have gaussian distributions the overall uncertainty is the square root of the sum of the squares of the individual uncertainties the main uncertainties outlined above the choice of the lumped parameter model aggregation errors in the assumed 3h input and the presence of a heterogeneous hydrogeological conductivity are all approximately 15 which would imply an overall uncertainty in mean transit times of approximately 30 while this is considerable the conclusion that the mean transit times are years to decades long is still valid relative differences in mean transit times within or between catchments are more readily assessed the subcatchments may have flow paths with different geometries or different degrees of heterogeneity of hydraulic conductivity which affects the comparison of mean transit times between subcatchments however if the geometry of the flow paths in an individual subcatchment are similar during wetter and drier periods and the hydraulic conductivities do not change relative differences in mean transit times at different streamflows in the same subcatchment are more robustly calculated the 3h activities of rainfall are probably closely similar over areas the size of the study area e g tadros et al 2014 again this allows the relative differences in mean transit times at different streamflows in the same subcatchment to be more readily assessed by contrast aggregation may affect the comparison of mean transit times both between subcatchments and within the same subcatchment at different streamflows if different stores of water are mobilised 5 4 predicting mean transit times table 3 and fig 10 summarises correlation coefficients between catchment attributes table 1 and the 3h activities at the low streamflow conditions in april 2015 table a1 because 3h activities are directly related to mean transit times correlations between catchment attributes and mean transit times are similar correlation coefficients are considered to be strong at r2 0 75 moderate at 0 75 r2 0 5 and weak at r2 0 5 there are few strong correlations table 3 fig 10 the 3h activities and the runoff coefficient are weakly correlated r2 0 37 for the dataset as a whole but have moderate to strong correlations r2 0 65 0 90 within the two catchments slopes and 3h activities have a strong negative correlation in the upper yarra subcatchments r2 0 88 but have weak negative correlations r2 0 08 in the upper latrobe subcatchments and a week positive correlation r2 0 32 across the two catchments there is a weak negative correlation between the proportion of cleared land and 3h activities r2 0 46 in the dataset as a whole and in the two individual catchments r2 0 1 0 27 drainage densities are weakly correlated with 3h activities both within r2 0 31 0 15 and across r2 0 03 the two catchments both the maximum and mean distances are have strong negative correlations with 3h activities in one of the catchments r2 0 75 and 0 81 but are not correlated across the two catchments r2 0 00 and 0 17 overall there are no strong correlations between most catchment attributes 3h activities that apply in both catchments or across the two catchments the correlation between runoff coefficients and 3h activities are stronger especially within the catchments the same range of factors that control the mean transit times probably control the runoff coefficient for example catchments with high evapotranspiration rates will have lower rates of recharge that result in longer mean transit times and lower runoff coefficients thus as is the case elsewhere in southeast australia cartwright and morgenstern 2015 the runoff coefficient may be a plausible proxy for mean transit times for streams in the same catchment there are multiple interacting factors that control the transmission of water through catchments e g as discussed by mcguire et al 2005 mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 soulsby et al 2009 hrachowitz et al 2009a 2009b 2010 2013 lachassagne et al 2011 in addition to the geomorphology and geometry of the catchments the hydraulic properties of the soils and underlying rocks together with variations in the degree of evapotranspiration are also important because clearing of eucalypt vegetation in southeast australia was commonly followed by an increase in recharge allison et al 1990 cartwright et al 2006 it was anticipated that the mean transit times in the cleared yarra catchment would be shorter than those in the latrobe catchment which is dominated by native forests however this was not observed other differences between the two catchments e g geology rainfall and possibly soil types may have more impact than differences in land use thus while land clearing may have reduced mean transit times in the yarra catchment this is not apparent by comparison with adjacent catchments in other catchments in southeast australia and elsewhere major ion concentrations may be used as a proxy for 3h activities morgenstern et al 2010 cartwright and morgenstern 2015 2016a b beyer et al 2016 howcroft et al 2017 the major ion concentrations in the upper latrobe subcatchments are generally lower than those in the yarra subcatchments which broadly reflects the differences in 3h activities in detail however major ion concentrations and 3h activities are poorly correlated e g fig 5 the lack of correlation may be due to different weathering reactions occurring at different localities in the catchments and evapotranspiration rates being spatially variable correlations within individual subcatchments at different streamflows are locally stronger for example r2 values for the correlation between na and 3h are up to 0 96 in the upper latrobe subcatchments and up to 0 72 in the upper yarra subcatchments this may allow the major ion geochemistry to be used as a proxy for 3h at different streamflows in individual subcatchments 6 summary and conclusions calculating precise mean transit times is difficult due to a range of uncertainties and characterising a catchment in sufficient detail to reduce some of these uncertainties would be difficult however estimating broad ranges of mean transit times is feasible additionally determining the variation in mean transit times at different streamflows within the same subcatchment is more easily achieved than comparing mean transit times between subcatchments the conclusion that the mean transit times at baseflow conditions are several years to decades in both the upper yarra and upper latrobe catchments is robust and is vital information for catchment management firstly it suggests that there is a long lived store of water in these catchments that can sustain streamflow during drought periods additionally the long mean transit times may result in considerable delay in contaminants reaching the streams via the groundwater in the yarra catchment agriculture local housing developments and small scale industries are potential sources of contaminants particularly nitrate that it was not possible to reliably predict 3h activities from individual catchment attributes including a major difference in landuse or the major ion geochemistry limits our ability to make first order predictions of mean transit times in similar catchments or at different times the runoff coefficient which has proven to be a reasonable indicator of mean transit times elsewhere in southeast australia cartwright and morgenstern 2015 provided the most reliable prediction of mean transit times this is probably due to both the runoff coefficient and mean transit times reflecting recharge rates and rates of groundwater flow within the catchments mean transit times are likely controlled by the interaction of catchment attributes such as slope or drainage density the hydraulic properties of the soils regolith and aquifers and evapotranspiration rates characterising hydraulic properties or evapotranspiration across a whole catchment would be difficult and understanding how the various attributes combine to control mean transit times is also difficult the mean transit times in the upper yarra and latrobe catchments are years to decades similar mean transit times are documented elsewhere in australia cartwright and morgenstern 2015 2016a 2016b duvert et al 2016 howcroft et al 2017 and new zealand morgenstern et al 2015 however mean transit times in catchments elsewhere appear to be only a few years e g mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 hrachowitz et al 2009a b speed et al 2010 it is not clear whether the differences in mean transit times relates to differences in climate depth of weathering vegetation types soil properties or relief this together with the challenge in predicting mean transit times

7477,a framework methodology is proposed for streamflow prediction in poorly gauged rivers located within large scale regions of sparse hydrometeorologic observation a multi criteria model evaluation is developed to select models that balance runoff efficiency with selection of accurate parameter values sparse observed data are supplemented by uncertain or low resolution information incorporated as soft data to estimate parameter values a priori model performance is tested in two catchments within a data poor region of southwestern china and results are compared to models selected using alternative calibration methods while all models perform consistently with respect to runoff efficiency nse range of 0 67 0 78 models selected using the proposed multi objective method may incorporate more representative parameter values than those selected by traditional calibration notably parameter values estimated by the proposed method resonate with direct estimates of catchment subsurface storage capacity parameter residuals of 20 and 61 mm for maximum soil moisture capacity c max and 0 91 and 0 48 for soil moisture distribution shape factor b where a parameter residual is equal to the centroid of a soft parameter value minus the calibrated parameter value a model more traditionally calibrated to observed data only single objective model estimates a much lower soil moisture capacity residuals of c max 475 and 518 mm and b 1 24 and 0 7 a constrained single objective model also underestimates maximum soil moisture capacity relative to a priori estimates residuals of c max 246 and 289 mm the proposed method may allow managers to more confidently transfer calibrated models to ungauged catchments for streamflow predictions even in the world s most data limited regions keywords streamflow prediction ungauged basins a priori parameter estimates hydrological modeling soft data multi objective calibration 1 introduction prediction of streamflow in ungauged catchments is surrounded by uncertainty and is thus a challenging yet vital task for water managers substantial advancements to the science of flow prediction have been made for instance through initiatives of the international association of hydrological sciences prediction in ungauged basins pub decade 2003 2012 the emergent framework synthesized from the first pub decade acknowledges catchment complexity and diversity as well as hydrological response signatures and highlights the importance of comparative hydrology for prediction in ungauged basins see blöschl et al 2013 while this forms a strong foundation upon which practical applications may develop prescriptive methods to bridge research advancements and practice may make such advances more accessible to water managers specific approaches to avoid and address pervasive flow prediction pitfalls such as over calibration of models andréassian et al 2012 kirchner 2006 and equifinality beven 1993 2006 are needed without such methods ad hoc and less comprehensive methods may be adopted in practice efstratiadis et al 2014 van emmerik et al 2015 especially in data limited regions where simple water balance methods may outperform rainfall runoff models chiew 2010 many flow prediction approaches utilize regional hydrologic networks to estimate streamflow in ungauged rivers such regionalization of model parameters has been applied widely and proven to be an efficient method for prediction over large spatial areas e g ibrahim et al 2015 parajka et al 2007a wang et al 2012 for instance arsenault and brissette 2014 compared three common regionalization techniques for predicting streamflow in 268 basins in quebec finding that approaches based on physical similarity performed the best kult et al 2014 then modeled the relationship between physical characteristics and hydrologic response in 163 watersheds in the great lakes basin through regionalization based on multiple linear regression and regression tree analysis the authors achieved satisfactory model performance median nse of 0 53 for their 62 validation watersheds without use of a rainfall runoff model despite the promise of regionalization techniques density of available gauging stations in the region surrounding a particular catchment of interest target catchment influences reliability oudin et al 2008 parajka et al 2015 thus methods based on regionalization may be limited in areas where densities of climatic hydrologic monitoring are far below the recommendations of world meteorological organization wmo 2008 such data sparsity is in fact directly associated with introduction of higher levels of catchment dissimilarity because it limits available choices for similar reference catchment s to target catchment s an alternative modeling approach in such cases must rely on the existing data including regional global data and must be robust to the extensive uncertainty inherent in sparse and low resolution data as well as some level of catchment dissimilarity multi objective analysis is a well established approach to address and lower prediction uncertainties and develop a more realistic modeling of hydrologic mechanisms see efstratiadis and koutsoyiannis 2010 for a review of such techniques multi objective evaluation has been incorporated into flow prediction approaches such as regionalization e g zhang et al 2008 yapo et al 1998 developed an algorithm to solve global optimization problems for multi objective models based on watershed output fluxes later confesor and whittaker 2007 used multi objective modeling for automatic calibration of the soil and water assessment tool swat to generate daily streamflows in the calapooia river in oregon swat was also calibrated in two watersheds in indiana by rajib et al 2016 using multiple objectives based on streamflow observations as well as remotely sensed surface soil moisture data and root zone soil moisture estimates from limited field sensor data merz et al 2009 2011 introduced a multi objective calibration technique based on constraining model parameters to pre defined beta distribution functions despite all advances in this field extensive observed data has normally been an important requirement of such techniques methods for applying such techniques to predict streamflow within regions of minimal data are lacking for example the approach proposed by merz et al 2009 2011 may not be applicable or reliable where observed data and previous local modeling experiments provide insufficient information to estimate a priori parameter distribution function to address the aforementioned challenges we propose a prescriptive framework methodology based on multi objective modeling to predict streamflows in data limited regions of the world accordingly our research objectives are to 1 develop a flexible methodology for prediction in ungauged catchments within data scarce regions 2 undertake a realistic test of performance by generating streamflow data in two genuine poorly gauged catchments embedded within a large sparsely gauged region of southwestern china and 3 test performance of our proposed method as compared to models selected through traditional single objective and constrained single objective calibration the proposed method targets the most data limited regions of the world but can in principle be applied to any region however it may not offer advantage over existing well established methods in data abundant regions the novelty of this work thus lies in three main factors 1 the proposed multi objective framework creates a platform to apply advanced conceptual hydrological models to ungauged catchments within severely data limited regions where existing methods requiring robust data are often inapplicable 2 the proposed method is designed to be highly flexible and potentially applicable to a wide range of catchments and regions we do not propose a new hydrologic model rather our proposed method is designed to wrap around a manager s model of choice allowing practitioners to select the best model for their location and objective the approach is also designed to be robust to some level of catchment dissimilarity providing flexibility for use in regions where choice of gauged catchments is limited and dissimilarity is inevitable 3 built upon the proposed framework we develop and test models in a remote area of southwestern china the experimental design is based on globally available subsurface data regional climatic data and a rainfall runoff model while flow prediction methodologies are often developed in well gauged regions assuming they are ungauged we develop and test our methods within a truly data limited region of the world where gauging stations are rare and sparse thus we demonstrate that the proposed methods may be suitable for practitioners in similar areas 2 methodology 2 1 a framework for flow prediction in severely data limited regions the first part of our proposed framework preliminary model testing fig 1 a consists of traditional single objective i e maximize runoff efficiency model calibration and validation in a gauged reference catchment model simplicity and avoidance of over parameterization should be prioritized in model selection kirchner 2006 sparse observations of forcing data may be supplemented with global or regional databases though bias correction of meteorological data may be necessary e g wi et al 2015 after a hydrologic model has been selected according to the practitioner s preference the model is calibrated and validated in the reference catchment such preliminary testing verifies the suitability of the underlying perceptual conceptual model for runoff prediction in the region the second part of the framework fig 1b consists of a priori parameter estimation and multi objective model calibration in the reference catchment followed by transfer of the final model to the target catchment s for prediction values of influential parameters are separately estimated in both reference and target catchments from available physical data there is opportunity for creativity as to how parameters may be estimated in the absence of hard data e g seibert and mcdonnell 2002 in lieu of detailed site scale observations global regional databases may be used as in this study to constrain the range of acceptable parameter values uncertainty in estimations by soft data i e qualitative knowledge that cannot be expressed by exact numbers or quantitative knowledge associated with high uncertainties may be acknowledged for instance by representing parameter values as fuzzy numbers a multi criteria objective function eq 4 is then parsed which aims to simultaneously maximize runoff efficiency and hone parameter values within the ranges estimated with soft and fuzzy data the model is re calibrated to this multi objective function using fuzzy arithmetic and the resulting model is transferred to the target catchment s for prediction the final step is to validate predicted streamflows in the target catchment s the remainder of this article describes the application of our proposed framework to two catchments within a severely data limited region of southwestern china in addition to demonstrating the applicability of the proposed framework in a truly poorly gauged region we undertake a comparison of model performance comparing our proposed method versus a single objective model as well as a constrained single objective model 2 2 model testing in upper salween river and upper mekong river basins 2 2 1 the region of study the international salween and mekong rivers known as nu and lancang rivers in china originate from the eastern highlands of the tibetan plateau and flow from north to south through yunnan province china before entering myanmar and laos respectively fig 2 near the yunnan tibet border the relief between the river valley and ridges varies by as much as 2500 m while the terrain is less steep further south there exist many tributaries to both rivers which in yunnan province drain small catchments in steep valleys as opposed to the mainstem rivers snow and glacial melt do not constitute a significant runoff source to tributaries chinese academy of sciences 1990 yunnan bureau of hydrology and water resources 2005 mekong river commission 2005 the climate is monsoonal though climate varies considerably with local topography in yunnan province mekong river commission 2005 rainfall is characterized by two seasonal pulses first between february may and second between june october and high river flows correspond kibler and tullos 2013 streamflow and precipitation measurements are sparse in this mountainous region particularly in tributaries large scale subsurface data for the region are limited to global databases land use cover is similar in the upper salween river and upper mekong river basins more than 90 of the salween and 83 of the mekong basin in this region is covered by forests and other types of vegetation defries and hansen 2010 croplands cover about 7 of the land in the salween and about 15 of that in the mekong basin less than 0 1 of land is urbanized in either catchment 2 2 2 target and reference catchments we consider two target catchments for streamflow prediction yang bi jiang ybj river approximately 4300 km2 is a gauged catchment located in the upper mekong basin with a 20 year observed streamflow record we also pilot the method in a catchment with a much shorter record of observed streamflow data to realistically demonstrate challenges faced by practitioners predicting flows in poorly gauged regions laowo river approximately 575 km2 in the upper salween river basin fig 2 is a fifth order river that drains the western slopes of the ridge separating the salween and mekong river basins only one year of observed unregulated streamflow is available in laowo river the reference catchment yongchun river 197 km2 is a gauged tributary to the upper mekong river the tangshang daily stream gauge has been operational on the yongchun river since 1960 mean basin elevations in the laowo ybj and yongchun catchments are similar mean values of 2475 2612 and 2935 m respectively danielson and gesch 2011 and river flows in all catchments are dominated by rainfall runoff processes land cover is similar in all three catchments with about 90 of each basin covered by forests and other types of vegetation while croplands cover about 10 of the land defries and hansen 2010 2 2 3 catchment similarity choosing a reference catchment that is hydrologically similar to target catchment s will generally yield more accurate runoff predictions singh et al 2014 however the choice of a reference catchment may be limited in sparsely gauged regions here we test target catchments that are only partially similar to the reference catchment while the target and reference catchments are similar with respect to topography climate and land cover the contributing area of the reference catchment is much smaller than either target catchment a q q plot wilk and gnanadesikan 1968 of nine daily streamflow quantiles fig 3 indicates a linear relationship between distribution functions of streamflow in the reference and target catchments providing some superficial evidence of their hydrologic similarity however the rivers are potentially far from perfect hydrologic analogs due to their substantial size differences 2 2 4 model selection and initial testing we chose a simple conceptual model hymod moore 1985 1999 for flow prediction hymod is a lumped deterministic model that predicts river flows based on simulated probability distributions of soil moisture to avoid over parameterization we chose the simplest form of hymod the 5 parameter model in this model a catchment consists of infinite points each defined by a soil moisture capacity soil moisture capacities vary within the catchment as a result of variability in soil texture and depth wang et al 2009 a cumulative distribution function cdf describes catchment soil moisture variability eq 1 1 f c 1 1 c c max b 0 c c max where c is soil moisture capacity c max is the maximum soil moisture capacity within the catchment and b is a shape factor that is dependent on the degree of spatial variability in soil moisture capacities besides c max and b the other parameters of hymod include r q which is inverse of residence time in quick reservoirs r s which is inverse of residence time in a slow reservoir and α which is a fraction coefficient for distribution of water between slow and quick reservoirs for the sake of brevity we refer our readers to wang et al 2009 and moore 1985 1999 for a comprehensive description of hymod we coded hymod into matlab mathworks 2012 in a configuration that can process 10 000 different combinations of model parameters for 13 years of daily data within 15 mins on a typical processor intel core i7 5500u 2 40 ghz 2 2 4 1 estimating precipitation and pet to estimate precipitation and potential evapotranspiration pet we extracted daily cumulative precipitation mm and daily mean temperature c respectively from the aphrodite precipitation dataset and aphrotemp dataset for monsoon asia aphrodite website 2015 daily precipitation and temperature were extracted from 0 25 resolution grids and mean values were computed over the reference and target catchments we used thornthwaite 1948 approach to estimate pet from temperature data we estimated daylight length using the model of forsythe et al 1995 which uses latitude and day of the year for its estimations we chose aphrodite because it covers our period of analysis before 1987 and has been shown to perform comparably to or better than other precipitation data products e g chen et al 2017 khandu et al 2016 zhao et al 2015 however the aphrodite dataset is associated with underestimation of precipitation in high altitudes due poor representation of orographic effect kishore et al 2015 wi et al 2015 to ensure accurate precipitation input we compared aphrodite precipitation with daily precipitation estimated from observations within the region s sparse ground based precipitation network 1960 1987 as the region s limited locations of long term observed rainfall data did not justify advanced methods we applied the inverse distance weighting idw method chen and liu 2012 keblouti et al 2012 comparisons of aphrodite and idw hyetographs with observed streamflow hydrographs indicate that timing of precipitation was better represented by aphrodite fig 4 however we expect that long term precipitation estimations given by observed data will provide more accurate estimations of annual cumulative precipitation we followed the empirical quantile mapping approach bennett et al 2014 lafon et al 2013 to bias correct magnitudes of catchment averaged daily precipitation from aphrodite using idw cumulative distribution functions to avoid overfitting of aphrodite to idw data we mapped two discrete quantiles q 0 q 50 and q 50 q 100 in the yongchun catchment aphrodite and idw cdfs correspond well fig 5 a thus transfer functions of unity were applied across all quantiles in the laowo catchment cdfs illustrate that aphrodite underestimated long term precipitation as compared to idw fig 5b therefore transfer functions of 1 26 and 1 4 were applied respectively to daily precipitation values below 3 96 mm and above 3 96 mm similarly in ybj transfer functions of 0 98 and 1 12 were applied respectively to precipitation values below 4 23 mm and above 4 23 mm 2 2 4 2 single objective calibration we calibrated hymod in yongchun catchment using observed streamflow data from 1961 to 1973 and validated the model from 1975 to 1980 chinese ministry of hydrology 1970 1971 1974 1977 1982 we analyzed the impact on parameter estimates of swapping the calibration and validation periods observed discharge data were prepared for prediction periods in laowo 1987 and ybj 1962 1973 1975 76 1978 1980 1984 85 and 1987 henck et al 2010 we investigated a wide feasible range of hymod parameters table 1 we calibrated the model by running 9375 different parameter combinations through a branch and bound method with the single objective to maximize nash sutcliffe runoff efficiency nse through our branch and bound method the model first discretized the feasible range given for each parameter into 4 equal sections with 5 boundary values all combinations of boundary values 5 5 3125 were then tested to maximize runoff efficiency a region of one third of the original parameter space was further investigated around each selected parameter equally distributed on both sides of the selected value if possible i e if the selected value was not too close to the lower or upper limits of the feasible range the newly selected range for each parameter was discretized similarly to the previous step and 3125 different parameter combinations were again tested to optimize the objective function this process was performed one more time choosing only one third of the constrained parameter space without crossing the borders to the previous range the final parameter values selected through single objective calibration were used to validate model performance in yongchun river 2 2 5 multi objective model evaluation 2 2 5 1 estimation of model parameters associated with soil moisture capacity using soft data rather than relying on rote calibration to discharge observations in the reference catchment we seek to improve model performance in ungauged target catchments by increasing confidence in parameter estimates however only little and highly uncertain information is available to characterize soil moisture capacity in the region of study we used international soil reference and information centre isric databases to estimate the total available water capacity tawc wise30sec dataset batjes 2015 and depth to bedrock soilgrids1km dataset hengl et al 2014 both datasets are global in coverage combining tawc cm and depth to bedrock cm we estimated the soil moisture capacity cm in each catchment at a spatial resolution of approximately 1 km2 we then created empirical cdfs of soil moisture capacity at the catchment scale we fitted the hymod soil moisture capacity cdf eq 1 to the empirical cdfs to estimate values of b and c max directly from soft data fig 6 use of the global datasets potentially introduces substantial uncertainty which we addressed by considering ranges within extreme potential end members and defining parameters as trapezoidal fuzzy numbers depth to bedrock in the global dataset is reported only to a maximum value of 2 4 m however it is possible that soil depth in parts of the study areas may exceed 2 4 m in total about 75 km2 38 of yongchun 1427 km2 33 of ybj and 98 km2 21 of laowo are characterized by the maximum soil depth of 2 4 m to characterize the additional uncertainty in soil moisture capacity of these particularly data limited areas we estimate two extreme potential end members of maximum soil depth of 2 4 m and 4 8 m through this approach we provide a reasonable estimation of the lower and upper bounds of the soil moisture capacity cdfs and hymod parameters values fig 6 a more comprehensive explanation of our analysis approach has been provided as supplementary material published online with this manuscript using the values of b and c max fitted to empirical cdfs of soft data we defined trapezoidal fuzzy numbers a x l x c 1 x c 2 x r for these parameters in each catchment table 2 as in fig 7 2 2 5 2 creation of a multi criteria objective function to encompass additional information given by soft data we developed a multi criteria objective function of for model calibration the criteria include minimize the ratio between model error and variation in observed data i e maximize nse criterion 1 and minimize the difference between b and c max values estimated through optimization and soft data criteria 2 and 3 respectively to standardize the three criteria into one coherent function we present each as a value from 0 to 1 after determining the feasible range of each parameter x min x max table 1 criteria 2 and 3 were normalized as in eq 2 2 a x a x m if defuzz a x max defuzz a x min then x m x max else x m x min where a is the estimated trapezoidal fuzzy value of the parameter of interest x is the estimated value for the same parameter by model calibration x m is either x min or x max and defuzz denotes the defuzzification process through the centroid method sugeno 1985 we allowed the strength of each individual criterion to vary with respect to the others by permitting unique weighting of the criteria weights were first assigned in the form of crisp non fuzzy numbers considering relative importance of the criteria level of certainty in a priori parameter estimations and degree of resonance between estimations in the reference and target catchments weights were then converted to fuzzy numbers to address subjectivity associated with choice of weight therefore the weights for criteria 2 and 3 were modified into the form of triangular fuzzy numbers w x l x c x r table 3 as in eq 3 3 w x x x l x c x l x l x x c 1 x x c x r x x r x c x c x x r 0 otherwise given the uncertainty associated with parameter estimation by soft data we chose to weight criterion 1 maximize nse considerably higher than criteria 2 and 3 table 3 empirical analysis suggested a closer resonance between b estimations in yongchun and laowo than those in yongchun and ybj in assigning weights to criterion 2 fit b to value estimated by empirical analysis of soft data we accordingly assigned a higher initial weight to criterion 2 in laowo than in ybj table 3 we tested sensitivity of parameter values to criteria weighting detecting differences in some of parameter values returned by varying weights from 0 77 to 1 99 for b in ybj for instance finally the general form of the multi criteria objective function of is as follows 4 of i 1 n defuzz w i a i x i a i x mi defuzz w n 1 1 nse nse 1 t 1 t q o t q m t 2 t 1 t q o t q o 2 where w i is the fuzzy weight assigned to criterion i w n 1 is the weight assigned to criterion n 1 q o t is observed streamflow in time step t q m t is modeled streamflow in time step t and q o is the mean value of all observed streamflows the value of the of is almost always between 0 and 1 where of 0 indicates perfect match between parameter estimates from calibration and soft data analysis as well as a perfect match between observed and predicted streamflows 2 2 5 3 multi objective calibration and validation we again tested 9375 parameter combinations at the tangshang gauge in yongchun river during the calibration period and optimized the model through the same branch and bound method to minimize our multi objective function eq 4 as the goal at this time is flow prediction in the target catchments it was not necessary to validate the multi objective model in the reference catchment validation was instead performed in the target catchments laowo and ybj the calibrated models for laowo and ybj were respectively validated using streamflow observations in 1987 including an initialization period in 1986 and 1962 1987 with some years missing including an initialization period in 1961 2 2 6 evaluation of model performance comparing single to multi objective model selection we compared the performance of the multi objective calibrated model in each catchment against a single objective calibrated model and a constrained single objective calibrated model tables 4 and 5 for the single objective model we applied parameters estimated by single objective calibration to observed streamflow in the reference catchment for the constrained single objective model parameters b and c max were constrained to values between the lower and upper bounds estimated by empirical analysis of soft data table 2 and the model was calibrated to observed reference catchment streamflows for the multi objective model we applied parameter estimates derived by the multi objective calibration methods developed in section 2 2 5 in addition to comparing models by runoff efficiency nse we investigated parameter residuals eq 5 and the combined of objective function value eq 4 of each model 5 parameter residual centroid of parameter value estimated with soft data calibrated parameter value 3 results and discussion while all tested models performed well with respect to runoff efficiency table 4 models selected using the proposed multi objective method may incorporate more reasonable parameter values when models selected by single constrained single and multi objective calibration in the reference catchment yongchun are transferred to laowo for prediction runoff efficiencies are similar respectively 0 78 0 77 and 0 74 fig 8 and table 4 however residuals of parameters b and c max are relatively large for the single objective model 1 24 and 475 mm respectively and of value 0 33 is greater than for the constrained single objective or multi objective models which may indicate the selection of less reasonable parameter values when the calibrated models are transferred to ybj for prediction the multi objective model substantially outperforms both the single objective and constrained single objective models with respect to parameter residuals 0 48 versus 0 65 and 0 7 for b and 61 mm versus 289 and 518 mm for c max which is reflected by a lower overall of value 0 27 versus 0 32 and 0 41 comparison with 20 years of observed data in ybj also indicates that runoff efficiency of the single objective model nse 0 67 is lower than the multi objective nse 0 72 and the constrained single objective nse 0 73 models thus benefits of incorporating catchment specific a priori parameter estimates based on soft data can be seen particularly in testing against longer observed time series 3 1 parameter estimation in target catchments laowo and ybj while values of r q r s and α are estimated to be similar across all three models table 5 values of c max and b vary across models according to the calibration method as per design the multi objective model consistently characterized c max as similar to the centroid of a priori estimates residuals in laowo ybj of 20 61 mm by comparison the single objective and constrained single objective models estimate values of c max that are much lower than a priori estimates residuals in laowo ybj of 475 518 mm and 246 289 mm respectively estimates of b values also varied among models relative to centroids of a priori estimates both the multi objective and constrained single objective models select similar values of b in both laowo b residual of 0 79 versus 0 91 and ybj b residual of 0 65 versus 0 48 both potentially estimate b more accurately than the single objective model b residual of 1 24 and 0 70 in laowo and ybj respectively overall the incorporation of a priori catchment specific parameter estimates or ranges led to very different representations of soil moisture capacity across both catchments as compared to models selected by single objective calibration fig 9 without compromising runoff efficiency these different representations of soil moisture capacity may translate into considerably different hydrological behaviors for example the greater soil storage capacities indicated by the a priori estimates and reflected in the multi objective model translate to a less flashy hydrologic response predictions may be characterized by more stable base flows fewer zero flow days and higher constancy of flow in comparison to the representations modeled by the constrained single objective model and especially the single objective model while many possibilities exist for matching runoff prediction to an existing data record beven 1993 2006 the multi objective calibration method may be more adept at parametrizing models to provide the right answers for the right reasons thus managers may feel more confident to utilize such models to predict flows in fully ungauged areas however it should be noted that more exhaustive evaluation of the methods presented here are required to ensure that similar results would be replicated in other data limited regions of the world 3 2 calibration using a multi objective function optimizing to a multi criteria of value during calibration proves a robust method to incorporate important characteristics of models in this case including runoff efficiency and parameters controlling soil moisture capacity in both catchments the constrained single and multi objective models perform comparably with respect to runoff efficiency and representation of soil moisture capacity though in both cases the multi objective model matches a priori estimates of maximum soil moisture capacity more closely by contrast the single objective model consistently represents soil moisture capacity as much lower than a priori parameter estimates in ybj the single objective model also underperforms with respect to nse this suite of information is collated through the of value which indicates that the multi objective model is in both catchments the superior overall model simultaneously optimizing to multiple criteria in a weighted of value may be a solution that helps managers differentiate between models with similar performance in runoff efficiency yet which portray vastly different hydrological processes equifinality as discussed above our results underscore prior findings that multi objective calibration methods including objectives to match parameter estimates with ground truthed values provide better hydrologic representation than models parameterized using rote calibration to observed runoff parajka et al 2007b rajib et al 2016 seibert and mcdonnell 2002 the performance of the constrained single objective model which takes advantage of parameter ranges constrained by a priori estimates is comparable and computationally less demanding than the multi objective model however the multi objective model may be preferable for several reasons 1 as in this study the multi objective model may be more adept to represent physical hydrological characteristics of a catchment 2 the possibility of defining new criteria instead of using soft data in the form of hard constraints provides the opportunity of weighting the criteria and differentiating between them based on their relative importance or confidence in information 3 the lower and upper bounds of fuzzy numbers defined for a parameter may sometimes span across the entire feasible range of that parameter accordingly constraining a parameter within its feasible range would not add any information to the single objective model the multi objective model on the other hand could still use such soft data in calibration by putting more emphasis on the centroid of the estimates 4 the multi objective approach described herein allows the optimization process to search the entire feasible range of parameters while also incorporating the a priori estimates on the other hand hard constraints limit the search range based on these uncertain estimates 3 3 application of multi objective calibration for flow prediction in ungauged basins for practitioners wishing to simulate river flows in ungauged basins the proposed multi objective modeling framework allows for the application of advanced conceptual hydrological models within severely data limited regions where existing methods requiring robust data are often inapplicable as opposed to a new hydrologic model the proposed method is designed to work with a practitioner s preferred model allowing managers to select the best hydrologic model for their location and objective in many regions the proposed method may be an improvement over existing methods especially where data intensive regionalization techniques are infeasible however this remains subject to further evaluation in comparison to previous flow predictions in laowo river generated through a catchment similarity modeling approach kibler and alipour 2017 the multi objective model demonstrates substantial improvement with respect to runoff efficiency the considerable improvement in predictive skill attributes to multiple factors including improved rainfall bias correction but is primarily due to the more realistic representation of the relationship between reference and target catchments the proposed modeling approach is thus a proficient tool to bridge hydrologic non similarity between reference and target catchments in the region of study allowing for flexible use in the region where gauged catchments are few and dissimilarity is unavoidable robustness to some level of catchment dissimilarity is indebted to initial testing for suitability in the region of study before application and the influence of a priori parameter estimates from the target catchment in calibration for example suitability of hymod for the region of study was confirmed in an initial phase of traditional calibration to the single objective of maximizing runoff efficiency nse 0 74 and validation nse 0 75 in the reference catchment fig 10 swapping the calibration and validation periods did not change parameter estimates considerably a priori estimates derived from highly uncertain data may be the best available information in regions of sparse data in such cases practitioners may distribute unequal weights across of criteria to acknowledge uncertainty as demonstrated herein analysis of the sensitivity of parameter estimates to weighting result provided as supplementary material to this manuscript indicates that choice of weight is influential to estimates of b c max and α are less sensitive to weight and r q and r s are not influenced by weighting overall the weighting process should be performed based on confidence in a priori parameter estimates degree of resonance between estimations in the reference and target catchments expert opinions and a decision maker s level of risk tolerance to go from traditional performance metrics e g maximize nse to more physical hydrological based metrics e g minimize parameter estimate residuals the proposed method involves calibration to flow data from a reference catchment however optimization to the of value simultaneously encourages parameter values to remain similar to a priori values estimated in a different target catchment a loss in runoff efficiency during calibration relative to models calibrated to the single objective of echoing reference catchment flows is therefore sometimes to be expected for example calibration runoff efficiencies obtained during calibration in the reference catchment of the multi objective laowo ybj nse 0 67 0 67 fig 11 and constrained single objective models laowo ybj nse 0 69 0 71 were lower than the nse value obtained with single objective calibration nse 0 74 it is important to note however that lower runoff efficiencies at the calibration stage may not always translate to lower prediction efficiency when models are transferred to target catchments for instance the multi objective and constrained single objective models returned greater runoff efficiencies for prediction in ybj as compared to the single objective calibration despite the lower efficiency at the calibration stage 4 conclusion a multi objective framework for flow prediction in the most data limited regions of the world was proposed and successfully tested in a remote data limited region of southwestern china despite data limitations streamflow predictions generated by the proposed multi objective model demonstrated reasonable runoff efficiencies in two target catchments nse 0 72 and 0 74 performance of the proposed multi objective method was similar to that of single objective and constrained single objective models however the multi objective model also selected values of influential parameters that more closely resonate with a priori estimates derived from soft data parameter residuals relative to a priori estimates of maximum soil moisture capacity were lowest for the multi objective model 20 61 mm and much greater for the constrained single objective 246 289 mm and single objective 475 518 mm models managers predicting flows in regions of sparse data have been in some ways left behind in the wake of recent scientific advances in hydrologic modeling enhanced predictive tools that address the unique challenges faced in severely data limited regions are needed the proposed framework and approach to include a priori parameter estimates based on globally available data in model calibration offers a preliminary step towards greater process understanding in regions of severe data limitations for instance when models are blindly calibrated to observed data in a reference catchment managers may struggle to differentiate between competing models with similar performance but different representations of hydrological processes the proposed calibration to a multi objective function may allow practitioners to more confidently transfer calibrated models to predict flows in fully ungauged catchments future applications in more ungauged catchments and in other data limited regions of the world can better clarify the merits of the proposed framework acknowledgements we would like to thank dr dingbao wang

7477,a framework methodology is proposed for streamflow prediction in poorly gauged rivers located within large scale regions of sparse hydrometeorologic observation a multi criteria model evaluation is developed to select models that balance runoff efficiency with selection of accurate parameter values sparse observed data are supplemented by uncertain or low resolution information incorporated as soft data to estimate parameter values a priori model performance is tested in two catchments within a data poor region of southwestern china and results are compared to models selected using alternative calibration methods while all models perform consistently with respect to runoff efficiency nse range of 0 67 0 78 models selected using the proposed multi objective method may incorporate more representative parameter values than those selected by traditional calibration notably parameter values estimated by the proposed method resonate with direct estimates of catchment subsurface storage capacity parameter residuals of 20 and 61 mm for maximum soil moisture capacity c max and 0 91 and 0 48 for soil moisture distribution shape factor b where a parameter residual is equal to the centroid of a soft parameter value minus the calibrated parameter value a model more traditionally calibrated to observed data only single objective model estimates a much lower soil moisture capacity residuals of c max 475 and 518 mm and b 1 24 and 0 7 a constrained single objective model also underestimates maximum soil moisture capacity relative to a priori estimates residuals of c max 246 and 289 mm the proposed method may allow managers to more confidently transfer calibrated models to ungauged catchments for streamflow predictions even in the world s most data limited regions keywords streamflow prediction ungauged basins a priori parameter estimates hydrological modeling soft data multi objective calibration 1 introduction prediction of streamflow in ungauged catchments is surrounded by uncertainty and is thus a challenging yet vital task for water managers substantial advancements to the science of flow prediction have been made for instance through initiatives of the international association of hydrological sciences prediction in ungauged basins pub decade 2003 2012 the emergent framework synthesized from the first pub decade acknowledges catchment complexity and diversity as well as hydrological response signatures and highlights the importance of comparative hydrology for prediction in ungauged basins see blöschl et al 2013 while this forms a strong foundation upon which practical applications may develop prescriptive methods to bridge research advancements and practice may make such advances more accessible to water managers specific approaches to avoid and address pervasive flow prediction pitfalls such as over calibration of models andréassian et al 2012 kirchner 2006 and equifinality beven 1993 2006 are needed without such methods ad hoc and less comprehensive methods may be adopted in practice efstratiadis et al 2014 van emmerik et al 2015 especially in data limited regions where simple water balance methods may outperform rainfall runoff models chiew 2010 many flow prediction approaches utilize regional hydrologic networks to estimate streamflow in ungauged rivers such regionalization of model parameters has been applied widely and proven to be an efficient method for prediction over large spatial areas e g ibrahim et al 2015 parajka et al 2007a wang et al 2012 for instance arsenault and brissette 2014 compared three common regionalization techniques for predicting streamflow in 268 basins in quebec finding that approaches based on physical similarity performed the best kult et al 2014 then modeled the relationship between physical characteristics and hydrologic response in 163 watersheds in the great lakes basin through regionalization based on multiple linear regression and regression tree analysis the authors achieved satisfactory model performance median nse of 0 53 for their 62 validation watersheds without use of a rainfall runoff model despite the promise of regionalization techniques density of available gauging stations in the region surrounding a particular catchment of interest target catchment influences reliability oudin et al 2008 parajka et al 2015 thus methods based on regionalization may be limited in areas where densities of climatic hydrologic monitoring are far below the recommendations of world meteorological organization wmo 2008 such data sparsity is in fact directly associated with introduction of higher levels of catchment dissimilarity because it limits available choices for similar reference catchment s to target catchment s an alternative modeling approach in such cases must rely on the existing data including regional global data and must be robust to the extensive uncertainty inherent in sparse and low resolution data as well as some level of catchment dissimilarity multi objective analysis is a well established approach to address and lower prediction uncertainties and develop a more realistic modeling of hydrologic mechanisms see efstratiadis and koutsoyiannis 2010 for a review of such techniques multi objective evaluation has been incorporated into flow prediction approaches such as regionalization e g zhang et al 2008 yapo et al 1998 developed an algorithm to solve global optimization problems for multi objective models based on watershed output fluxes later confesor and whittaker 2007 used multi objective modeling for automatic calibration of the soil and water assessment tool swat to generate daily streamflows in the calapooia river in oregon swat was also calibrated in two watersheds in indiana by rajib et al 2016 using multiple objectives based on streamflow observations as well as remotely sensed surface soil moisture data and root zone soil moisture estimates from limited field sensor data merz et al 2009 2011 introduced a multi objective calibration technique based on constraining model parameters to pre defined beta distribution functions despite all advances in this field extensive observed data has normally been an important requirement of such techniques methods for applying such techniques to predict streamflow within regions of minimal data are lacking for example the approach proposed by merz et al 2009 2011 may not be applicable or reliable where observed data and previous local modeling experiments provide insufficient information to estimate a priori parameter distribution function to address the aforementioned challenges we propose a prescriptive framework methodology based on multi objective modeling to predict streamflows in data limited regions of the world accordingly our research objectives are to 1 develop a flexible methodology for prediction in ungauged catchments within data scarce regions 2 undertake a realistic test of performance by generating streamflow data in two genuine poorly gauged catchments embedded within a large sparsely gauged region of southwestern china and 3 test performance of our proposed method as compared to models selected through traditional single objective and constrained single objective calibration the proposed method targets the most data limited regions of the world but can in principle be applied to any region however it may not offer advantage over existing well established methods in data abundant regions the novelty of this work thus lies in three main factors 1 the proposed multi objective framework creates a platform to apply advanced conceptual hydrological models to ungauged catchments within severely data limited regions where existing methods requiring robust data are often inapplicable 2 the proposed method is designed to be highly flexible and potentially applicable to a wide range of catchments and regions we do not propose a new hydrologic model rather our proposed method is designed to wrap around a manager s model of choice allowing practitioners to select the best model for their location and objective the approach is also designed to be robust to some level of catchment dissimilarity providing flexibility for use in regions where choice of gauged catchments is limited and dissimilarity is inevitable 3 built upon the proposed framework we develop and test models in a remote area of southwestern china the experimental design is based on globally available subsurface data regional climatic data and a rainfall runoff model while flow prediction methodologies are often developed in well gauged regions assuming they are ungauged we develop and test our methods within a truly data limited region of the world where gauging stations are rare and sparse thus we demonstrate that the proposed methods may be suitable for practitioners in similar areas 2 methodology 2 1 a framework for flow prediction in severely data limited regions the first part of our proposed framework preliminary model testing fig 1 a consists of traditional single objective i e maximize runoff efficiency model calibration and validation in a gauged reference catchment model simplicity and avoidance of over parameterization should be prioritized in model selection kirchner 2006 sparse observations of forcing data may be supplemented with global or regional databases though bias correction of meteorological data may be necessary e g wi et al 2015 after a hydrologic model has been selected according to the practitioner s preference the model is calibrated and validated in the reference catchment such preliminary testing verifies the suitability of the underlying perceptual conceptual model for runoff prediction in the region the second part of the framework fig 1b consists of a priori parameter estimation and multi objective model calibration in the reference catchment followed by transfer of the final model to the target catchment s for prediction values of influential parameters are separately estimated in both reference and target catchments from available physical data there is opportunity for creativity as to how parameters may be estimated in the absence of hard data e g seibert and mcdonnell 2002 in lieu of detailed site scale observations global regional databases may be used as in this study to constrain the range of acceptable parameter values uncertainty in estimations by soft data i e qualitative knowledge that cannot be expressed by exact numbers or quantitative knowledge associated with high uncertainties may be acknowledged for instance by representing parameter values as fuzzy numbers a multi criteria objective function eq 4 is then parsed which aims to simultaneously maximize runoff efficiency and hone parameter values within the ranges estimated with soft and fuzzy data the model is re calibrated to this multi objective function using fuzzy arithmetic and the resulting model is transferred to the target catchment s for prediction the final step is to validate predicted streamflows in the target catchment s the remainder of this article describes the application of our proposed framework to two catchments within a severely data limited region of southwestern china in addition to demonstrating the applicability of the proposed framework in a truly poorly gauged region we undertake a comparison of model performance comparing our proposed method versus a single objective model as well as a constrained single objective model 2 2 model testing in upper salween river and upper mekong river basins 2 2 1 the region of study the international salween and mekong rivers known as nu and lancang rivers in china originate from the eastern highlands of the tibetan plateau and flow from north to south through yunnan province china before entering myanmar and laos respectively fig 2 near the yunnan tibet border the relief between the river valley and ridges varies by as much as 2500 m while the terrain is less steep further south there exist many tributaries to both rivers which in yunnan province drain small catchments in steep valleys as opposed to the mainstem rivers snow and glacial melt do not constitute a significant runoff source to tributaries chinese academy of sciences 1990 yunnan bureau of hydrology and water resources 2005 mekong river commission 2005 the climate is monsoonal though climate varies considerably with local topography in yunnan province mekong river commission 2005 rainfall is characterized by two seasonal pulses first between february may and second between june october and high river flows correspond kibler and tullos 2013 streamflow and precipitation measurements are sparse in this mountainous region particularly in tributaries large scale subsurface data for the region are limited to global databases land use cover is similar in the upper salween river and upper mekong river basins more than 90 of the salween and 83 of the mekong basin in this region is covered by forests and other types of vegetation defries and hansen 2010 croplands cover about 7 of the land in the salween and about 15 of that in the mekong basin less than 0 1 of land is urbanized in either catchment 2 2 2 target and reference catchments we consider two target catchments for streamflow prediction yang bi jiang ybj river approximately 4300 km2 is a gauged catchment located in the upper mekong basin with a 20 year observed streamflow record we also pilot the method in a catchment with a much shorter record of observed streamflow data to realistically demonstrate challenges faced by practitioners predicting flows in poorly gauged regions laowo river approximately 575 km2 in the upper salween river basin fig 2 is a fifth order river that drains the western slopes of the ridge separating the salween and mekong river basins only one year of observed unregulated streamflow is available in laowo river the reference catchment yongchun river 197 km2 is a gauged tributary to the upper mekong river the tangshang daily stream gauge has been operational on the yongchun river since 1960 mean basin elevations in the laowo ybj and yongchun catchments are similar mean values of 2475 2612 and 2935 m respectively danielson and gesch 2011 and river flows in all catchments are dominated by rainfall runoff processes land cover is similar in all three catchments with about 90 of each basin covered by forests and other types of vegetation while croplands cover about 10 of the land defries and hansen 2010 2 2 3 catchment similarity choosing a reference catchment that is hydrologically similar to target catchment s will generally yield more accurate runoff predictions singh et al 2014 however the choice of a reference catchment may be limited in sparsely gauged regions here we test target catchments that are only partially similar to the reference catchment while the target and reference catchments are similar with respect to topography climate and land cover the contributing area of the reference catchment is much smaller than either target catchment a q q plot wilk and gnanadesikan 1968 of nine daily streamflow quantiles fig 3 indicates a linear relationship between distribution functions of streamflow in the reference and target catchments providing some superficial evidence of their hydrologic similarity however the rivers are potentially far from perfect hydrologic analogs due to their substantial size differences 2 2 4 model selection and initial testing we chose a simple conceptual model hymod moore 1985 1999 for flow prediction hymod is a lumped deterministic model that predicts river flows based on simulated probability distributions of soil moisture to avoid over parameterization we chose the simplest form of hymod the 5 parameter model in this model a catchment consists of infinite points each defined by a soil moisture capacity soil moisture capacities vary within the catchment as a result of variability in soil texture and depth wang et al 2009 a cumulative distribution function cdf describes catchment soil moisture variability eq 1 1 f c 1 1 c c max b 0 c c max where c is soil moisture capacity c max is the maximum soil moisture capacity within the catchment and b is a shape factor that is dependent on the degree of spatial variability in soil moisture capacities besides c max and b the other parameters of hymod include r q which is inverse of residence time in quick reservoirs r s which is inverse of residence time in a slow reservoir and α which is a fraction coefficient for distribution of water between slow and quick reservoirs for the sake of brevity we refer our readers to wang et al 2009 and moore 1985 1999 for a comprehensive description of hymod we coded hymod into matlab mathworks 2012 in a configuration that can process 10 000 different combinations of model parameters for 13 years of daily data within 15 mins on a typical processor intel core i7 5500u 2 40 ghz 2 2 4 1 estimating precipitation and pet to estimate precipitation and potential evapotranspiration pet we extracted daily cumulative precipitation mm and daily mean temperature c respectively from the aphrodite precipitation dataset and aphrotemp dataset for monsoon asia aphrodite website 2015 daily precipitation and temperature were extracted from 0 25 resolution grids and mean values were computed over the reference and target catchments we used thornthwaite 1948 approach to estimate pet from temperature data we estimated daylight length using the model of forsythe et al 1995 which uses latitude and day of the year for its estimations we chose aphrodite because it covers our period of analysis before 1987 and has been shown to perform comparably to or better than other precipitation data products e g chen et al 2017 khandu et al 2016 zhao et al 2015 however the aphrodite dataset is associated with underestimation of precipitation in high altitudes due poor representation of orographic effect kishore et al 2015 wi et al 2015 to ensure accurate precipitation input we compared aphrodite precipitation with daily precipitation estimated from observations within the region s sparse ground based precipitation network 1960 1987 as the region s limited locations of long term observed rainfall data did not justify advanced methods we applied the inverse distance weighting idw method chen and liu 2012 keblouti et al 2012 comparisons of aphrodite and idw hyetographs with observed streamflow hydrographs indicate that timing of precipitation was better represented by aphrodite fig 4 however we expect that long term precipitation estimations given by observed data will provide more accurate estimations of annual cumulative precipitation we followed the empirical quantile mapping approach bennett et al 2014 lafon et al 2013 to bias correct magnitudes of catchment averaged daily precipitation from aphrodite using idw cumulative distribution functions to avoid overfitting of aphrodite to idw data we mapped two discrete quantiles q 0 q 50 and q 50 q 100 in the yongchun catchment aphrodite and idw cdfs correspond well fig 5 a thus transfer functions of unity were applied across all quantiles in the laowo catchment cdfs illustrate that aphrodite underestimated long term precipitation as compared to idw fig 5b therefore transfer functions of 1 26 and 1 4 were applied respectively to daily precipitation values below 3 96 mm and above 3 96 mm similarly in ybj transfer functions of 0 98 and 1 12 were applied respectively to precipitation values below 4 23 mm and above 4 23 mm 2 2 4 2 single objective calibration we calibrated hymod in yongchun catchment using observed streamflow data from 1961 to 1973 and validated the model from 1975 to 1980 chinese ministry of hydrology 1970 1971 1974 1977 1982 we analyzed the impact on parameter estimates of swapping the calibration and validation periods observed discharge data were prepared for prediction periods in laowo 1987 and ybj 1962 1973 1975 76 1978 1980 1984 85 and 1987 henck et al 2010 we investigated a wide feasible range of hymod parameters table 1 we calibrated the model by running 9375 different parameter combinations through a branch and bound method with the single objective to maximize nash sutcliffe runoff efficiency nse through our branch and bound method the model first discretized the feasible range given for each parameter into 4 equal sections with 5 boundary values all combinations of boundary values 5 5 3125 were then tested to maximize runoff efficiency a region of one third of the original parameter space was further investigated around each selected parameter equally distributed on both sides of the selected value if possible i e if the selected value was not too close to the lower or upper limits of the feasible range the newly selected range for each parameter was discretized similarly to the previous step and 3125 different parameter combinations were again tested to optimize the objective function this process was performed one more time choosing only one third of the constrained parameter space without crossing the borders to the previous range the final parameter values selected through single objective calibration were used to validate model performance in yongchun river 2 2 5 multi objective model evaluation 2 2 5 1 estimation of model parameters associated with soil moisture capacity using soft data rather than relying on rote calibration to discharge observations in the reference catchment we seek to improve model performance in ungauged target catchments by increasing confidence in parameter estimates however only little and highly uncertain information is available to characterize soil moisture capacity in the region of study we used international soil reference and information centre isric databases to estimate the total available water capacity tawc wise30sec dataset batjes 2015 and depth to bedrock soilgrids1km dataset hengl et al 2014 both datasets are global in coverage combining tawc cm and depth to bedrock cm we estimated the soil moisture capacity cm in each catchment at a spatial resolution of approximately 1 km2 we then created empirical cdfs of soil moisture capacity at the catchment scale we fitted the hymod soil moisture capacity cdf eq 1 to the empirical cdfs to estimate values of b and c max directly from soft data fig 6 use of the global datasets potentially introduces substantial uncertainty which we addressed by considering ranges within extreme potential end members and defining parameters as trapezoidal fuzzy numbers depth to bedrock in the global dataset is reported only to a maximum value of 2 4 m however it is possible that soil depth in parts of the study areas may exceed 2 4 m in total about 75 km2 38 of yongchun 1427 km2 33 of ybj and 98 km2 21 of laowo are characterized by the maximum soil depth of 2 4 m to characterize the additional uncertainty in soil moisture capacity of these particularly data limited areas we estimate two extreme potential end members of maximum soil depth of 2 4 m and 4 8 m through this approach we provide a reasonable estimation of the lower and upper bounds of the soil moisture capacity cdfs and hymod parameters values fig 6 a more comprehensive explanation of our analysis approach has been provided as supplementary material published online with this manuscript using the values of b and c max fitted to empirical cdfs of soft data we defined trapezoidal fuzzy numbers a x l x c 1 x c 2 x r for these parameters in each catchment table 2 as in fig 7 2 2 5 2 creation of a multi criteria objective function to encompass additional information given by soft data we developed a multi criteria objective function of for model calibration the criteria include minimize the ratio between model error and variation in observed data i e maximize nse criterion 1 and minimize the difference between b and c max values estimated through optimization and soft data criteria 2 and 3 respectively to standardize the three criteria into one coherent function we present each as a value from 0 to 1 after determining the feasible range of each parameter x min x max table 1 criteria 2 and 3 were normalized as in eq 2 2 a x a x m if defuzz a x max defuzz a x min then x m x max else x m x min where a is the estimated trapezoidal fuzzy value of the parameter of interest x is the estimated value for the same parameter by model calibration x m is either x min or x max and defuzz denotes the defuzzification process through the centroid method sugeno 1985 we allowed the strength of each individual criterion to vary with respect to the others by permitting unique weighting of the criteria weights were first assigned in the form of crisp non fuzzy numbers considering relative importance of the criteria level of certainty in a priori parameter estimations and degree of resonance between estimations in the reference and target catchments weights were then converted to fuzzy numbers to address subjectivity associated with choice of weight therefore the weights for criteria 2 and 3 were modified into the form of triangular fuzzy numbers w x l x c x r table 3 as in eq 3 3 w x x x l x c x l x l x x c 1 x x c x r x x r x c x c x x r 0 otherwise given the uncertainty associated with parameter estimation by soft data we chose to weight criterion 1 maximize nse considerably higher than criteria 2 and 3 table 3 empirical analysis suggested a closer resonance between b estimations in yongchun and laowo than those in yongchun and ybj in assigning weights to criterion 2 fit b to value estimated by empirical analysis of soft data we accordingly assigned a higher initial weight to criterion 2 in laowo than in ybj table 3 we tested sensitivity of parameter values to criteria weighting detecting differences in some of parameter values returned by varying weights from 0 77 to 1 99 for b in ybj for instance finally the general form of the multi criteria objective function of is as follows 4 of i 1 n defuzz w i a i x i a i x mi defuzz w n 1 1 nse nse 1 t 1 t q o t q m t 2 t 1 t q o t q o 2 where w i is the fuzzy weight assigned to criterion i w n 1 is the weight assigned to criterion n 1 q o t is observed streamflow in time step t q m t is modeled streamflow in time step t and q o is the mean value of all observed streamflows the value of the of is almost always between 0 and 1 where of 0 indicates perfect match between parameter estimates from calibration and soft data analysis as well as a perfect match between observed and predicted streamflows 2 2 5 3 multi objective calibration and validation we again tested 9375 parameter combinations at the tangshang gauge in yongchun river during the calibration period and optimized the model through the same branch and bound method to minimize our multi objective function eq 4 as the goal at this time is flow prediction in the target catchments it was not necessary to validate the multi objective model in the reference catchment validation was instead performed in the target catchments laowo and ybj the calibrated models for laowo and ybj were respectively validated using streamflow observations in 1987 including an initialization period in 1986 and 1962 1987 with some years missing including an initialization period in 1961 2 2 6 evaluation of model performance comparing single to multi objective model selection we compared the performance of the multi objective calibrated model in each catchment against a single objective calibrated model and a constrained single objective calibrated model tables 4 and 5 for the single objective model we applied parameters estimated by single objective calibration to observed streamflow in the reference catchment for the constrained single objective model parameters b and c max were constrained to values between the lower and upper bounds estimated by empirical analysis of soft data table 2 and the model was calibrated to observed reference catchment streamflows for the multi objective model we applied parameter estimates derived by the multi objective calibration methods developed in section 2 2 5 in addition to comparing models by runoff efficiency nse we investigated parameter residuals eq 5 and the combined of objective function value eq 4 of each model 5 parameter residual centroid of parameter value estimated with soft data calibrated parameter value 3 results and discussion while all tested models performed well with respect to runoff efficiency table 4 models selected using the proposed multi objective method may incorporate more reasonable parameter values when models selected by single constrained single and multi objective calibration in the reference catchment yongchun are transferred to laowo for prediction runoff efficiencies are similar respectively 0 78 0 77 and 0 74 fig 8 and table 4 however residuals of parameters b and c max are relatively large for the single objective model 1 24 and 475 mm respectively and of value 0 33 is greater than for the constrained single objective or multi objective models which may indicate the selection of less reasonable parameter values when the calibrated models are transferred to ybj for prediction the multi objective model substantially outperforms both the single objective and constrained single objective models with respect to parameter residuals 0 48 versus 0 65 and 0 7 for b and 61 mm versus 289 and 518 mm for c max which is reflected by a lower overall of value 0 27 versus 0 32 and 0 41 comparison with 20 years of observed data in ybj also indicates that runoff efficiency of the single objective model nse 0 67 is lower than the multi objective nse 0 72 and the constrained single objective nse 0 73 models thus benefits of incorporating catchment specific a priori parameter estimates based on soft data can be seen particularly in testing against longer observed time series 3 1 parameter estimation in target catchments laowo and ybj while values of r q r s and α are estimated to be similar across all three models table 5 values of c max and b vary across models according to the calibration method as per design the multi objective model consistently characterized c max as similar to the centroid of a priori estimates residuals in laowo ybj of 20 61 mm by comparison the single objective and constrained single objective models estimate values of c max that are much lower than a priori estimates residuals in laowo ybj of 475 518 mm and 246 289 mm respectively estimates of b values also varied among models relative to centroids of a priori estimates both the multi objective and constrained single objective models select similar values of b in both laowo b residual of 0 79 versus 0 91 and ybj b residual of 0 65 versus 0 48 both potentially estimate b more accurately than the single objective model b residual of 1 24 and 0 70 in laowo and ybj respectively overall the incorporation of a priori catchment specific parameter estimates or ranges led to very different representations of soil moisture capacity across both catchments as compared to models selected by single objective calibration fig 9 without compromising runoff efficiency these different representations of soil moisture capacity may translate into considerably different hydrological behaviors for example the greater soil storage capacities indicated by the a priori estimates and reflected in the multi objective model translate to a less flashy hydrologic response predictions may be characterized by more stable base flows fewer zero flow days and higher constancy of flow in comparison to the representations modeled by the constrained single objective model and especially the single objective model while many possibilities exist for matching runoff prediction to an existing data record beven 1993 2006 the multi objective calibration method may be more adept at parametrizing models to provide the right answers for the right reasons thus managers may feel more confident to utilize such models to predict flows in fully ungauged areas however it should be noted that more exhaustive evaluation of the methods presented here are required to ensure that similar results would be replicated in other data limited regions of the world 3 2 calibration using a multi objective function optimizing to a multi criteria of value during calibration proves a robust method to incorporate important characteristics of models in this case including runoff efficiency and parameters controlling soil moisture capacity in both catchments the constrained single and multi objective models perform comparably with respect to runoff efficiency and representation of soil moisture capacity though in both cases the multi objective model matches a priori estimates of maximum soil moisture capacity more closely by contrast the single objective model consistently represents soil moisture capacity as much lower than a priori parameter estimates in ybj the single objective model also underperforms with respect to nse this suite of information is collated through the of value which indicates that the multi objective model is in both catchments the superior overall model simultaneously optimizing to multiple criteria in a weighted of value may be a solution that helps managers differentiate between models with similar performance in runoff efficiency yet which portray vastly different hydrological processes equifinality as discussed above our results underscore prior findings that multi objective calibration methods including objectives to match parameter estimates with ground truthed values provide better hydrologic representation than models parameterized using rote calibration to observed runoff parajka et al 2007b rajib et al 2016 seibert and mcdonnell 2002 the performance of the constrained single objective model which takes advantage of parameter ranges constrained by a priori estimates is comparable and computationally less demanding than the multi objective model however the multi objective model may be preferable for several reasons 1 as in this study the multi objective model may be more adept to represent physical hydrological characteristics of a catchment 2 the possibility of defining new criteria instead of using soft data in the form of hard constraints provides the opportunity of weighting the criteria and differentiating between them based on their relative importance or confidence in information 3 the lower and upper bounds of fuzzy numbers defined for a parameter may sometimes span across the entire feasible range of that parameter accordingly constraining a parameter within its feasible range would not add any information to the single objective model the multi objective model on the other hand could still use such soft data in calibration by putting more emphasis on the centroid of the estimates 4 the multi objective approach described herein allows the optimization process to search the entire feasible range of parameters while also incorporating the a priori estimates on the other hand hard constraints limit the search range based on these uncertain estimates 3 3 application of multi objective calibration for flow prediction in ungauged basins for practitioners wishing to simulate river flows in ungauged basins the proposed multi objective modeling framework allows for the application of advanced conceptual hydrological models within severely data limited regions where existing methods requiring robust data are often inapplicable as opposed to a new hydrologic model the proposed method is designed to work with a practitioner s preferred model allowing managers to select the best hydrologic model for their location and objective in many regions the proposed method may be an improvement over existing methods especially where data intensive regionalization techniques are infeasible however this remains subject to further evaluation in comparison to previous flow predictions in laowo river generated through a catchment similarity modeling approach kibler and alipour 2017 the multi objective model demonstrates substantial improvement with respect to runoff efficiency the considerable improvement in predictive skill attributes to multiple factors including improved rainfall bias correction but is primarily due to the more realistic representation of the relationship between reference and target catchments the proposed modeling approach is thus a proficient tool to bridge hydrologic non similarity between reference and target catchments in the region of study allowing for flexible use in the region where gauged catchments are few and dissimilarity is unavoidable robustness to some level of catchment dissimilarity is indebted to initial testing for suitability in the region of study before application and the influence of a priori parameter estimates from the target catchment in calibration for example suitability of hymod for the region of study was confirmed in an initial phase of traditional calibration to the single objective of maximizing runoff efficiency nse 0 74 and validation nse 0 75 in the reference catchment fig 10 swapping the calibration and validation periods did not change parameter estimates considerably a priori estimates derived from highly uncertain data may be the best available information in regions of sparse data in such cases practitioners may distribute unequal weights across of criteria to acknowledge uncertainty as demonstrated herein analysis of the sensitivity of parameter estimates to weighting result provided as supplementary material to this manuscript indicates that choice of weight is influential to estimates of b c max and α are less sensitive to weight and r q and r s are not influenced by weighting overall the weighting process should be performed based on confidence in a priori parameter estimates degree of resonance between estimations in the reference and target catchments expert opinions and a decision maker s level of risk tolerance to go from traditional performance metrics e g maximize nse to more physical hydrological based metrics e g minimize parameter estimate residuals the proposed method involves calibration to flow data from a reference catchment however optimization to the of value simultaneously encourages parameter values to remain similar to a priori values estimated in a different target catchment a loss in runoff efficiency during calibration relative to models calibrated to the single objective of echoing reference catchment flows is therefore sometimes to be expected for example calibration runoff efficiencies obtained during calibration in the reference catchment of the multi objective laowo ybj nse 0 67 0 67 fig 11 and constrained single objective models laowo ybj nse 0 69 0 71 were lower than the nse value obtained with single objective calibration nse 0 74 it is important to note however that lower runoff efficiencies at the calibration stage may not always translate to lower prediction efficiency when models are transferred to target catchments for instance the multi objective and constrained single objective models returned greater runoff efficiencies for prediction in ybj as compared to the single objective calibration despite the lower efficiency at the calibration stage 4 conclusion a multi objective framework for flow prediction in the most data limited regions of the world was proposed and successfully tested in a remote data limited region of southwestern china despite data limitations streamflow predictions generated by the proposed multi objective model demonstrated reasonable runoff efficiencies in two target catchments nse 0 72 and 0 74 performance of the proposed multi objective method was similar to that of single objective and constrained single objective models however the multi objective model also selected values of influential parameters that more closely resonate with a priori estimates derived from soft data parameter residuals relative to a priori estimates of maximum soil moisture capacity were lowest for the multi objective model 20 61 mm and much greater for the constrained single objective 246 289 mm and single objective 475 518 mm models managers predicting flows in regions of sparse data have been in some ways left behind in the wake of recent scientific advances in hydrologic modeling enhanced predictive tools that address the unique challenges faced in severely data limited regions are needed the proposed framework and approach to include a priori parameter estimates based on globally available data in model calibration offers a preliminary step towards greater process understanding in regions of severe data limitations for instance when models are blindly calibrated to observed data in a reference catchment managers may struggle to differentiate between competing models with similar performance but different representations of hydrological processes the proposed calibration to a multi objective function may allow practitioners to more confidently transfer calibrated models to predict flows in fully ungauged catchments future

7478,the groundwater of the cabo de gata detritic aquifer in southeastern spain exhibit salinities of between 70 726 mmol l of cl brackish salt to hypersaline waters we have investigated the causes of the high salinity anomaly which at certain points exceeds that of present day seawater 600 mmol l two hypotheses are considered as possible sources for the saline water 1 the deeper more saline groundwater date back to an old marine intrusion that occurred at the end of the last ice age 14 17 ka when seawater salinity was higher than in the present day this hypothesis is supported by the values of 14c measured in this water 6 10 pmc which indicate old water of up to 17 ka however the values of 18o and 2h are lower than would be expected 2 the water is the result of mixing between fresh groundwater and seawater the latter explanation agrees well with the low values of 18o and 2h this mixture is later subject to evaporation explaining its high salinity hydrogeochemical modelling was carried out for the most saline samples assuming such mixing between freshwater and seawater followed by evaporation and the results show a very good agreement between the measured and simulated values according to the model calculation the original mixture contained approximately 60 seawater and its volume subsequently was reduced through evaporation by around 30 this mixing and evaporation could occur during the flandrian transgression 6000 8000 y when this area accommodated a coastal lagoon keywords hydrogeochemical modelling groundwater age evaporation paleohydrology coastal lagoon 1 introduction marine intrusion and salinization of coastal aquifers is one of the most worrying environmental problems faced in coastal areas throughout the world ferguson and gleeson 2012 werner et al 2013 colombani et al 2016 nevertheless the high salinities that exhibit some coastal aquifers are not due to deficient management by human or to the effect of sea level rise as a consequence of anthropogenic climate change provoked by man there are numerous examples of elevated groundwater salinity due to natural interactions between the groundwater and the matrix rock daniele et al 2013 mollema et al 2013 carreira et al 2014 or as legacies of its geological past edmunds 2001 raidla et al 2009 cary et al 2015 the position of the fresh saline water interface has been under continuous dynamic evolution throughout the entire quaternary as a consequence of the wide fluctuations in sea level that occurred over this period which have also entailed salinity changes in the seawater thunell and williams 1989 emeis et al 2000 holloway et al 2016 these fluctuations which could have reached as much as 130 m e g chappell et al 1996 meant that large areas of coastal plains and platforms emerged above or were submerged below sea level and large aquifer volumes as well attempts have been made to mathematically simulate the effect of these sea level variations on the position of the interface both for past fluctuations delsman et al 2014 and as predictions for the future yechieli et al 2010 ketabchi et al 2016 the rate of these fluctuations can be very high at certain times with rises of up to 10 mm y 1 having been recorded camoin et al 2012 the stabilization of the freshwater seawater interface in the new conditions can be markedly slower than the variations in sea level being a function of parameters such as horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer and the rate of recharge groen et al 2000 kooi et al 2000 thus it is possible that the position of the interface is not in equilibrium with the current sea level as occurs over wide areas along the atlantic coastline of the usa meisler et al 1984 south america groen et al 2000 and in low altitude active areas such as bangladesh worland et al 2015 alternatively lenses of water may exist in low permeability areas with salinities different from what would be expected where the freshwater has not completely flushed the aquifer to displace the salt water or vice versa capaccioni et al 2005 sola et al 2013 currell et al 2015 cases of ancient seawater trapped in coastal

al 2015 lee et al 2016 old saline water 10 000 years with salinity of about half that of seawater was also found in several sub aquifers in the israeli coastal aquifer where it was explained by seawater intrusion as a result of the last sea level rise yechieli et al 2009 the presence of water with an anomalous salinity in relation to the present day coastline implies that coastal aquifers are naturally complex systems that may be far from the general model of two water masses of differing density separated by a clear interface custodio 2004 post 2004 for this reason detailed studies including dating using isotope data from the aquifer water become a necessity if the approximate geological evolution of an aquifer system from the present day observations needs to be gained love et

salinity higher than seawater preliminary work was done by means of hydrochemical and isotopic analyses sola et al 2014 in order to achieve a better understanding of the processes that affect to this aquifer system a new sampling campaign done including new isotopes carbon 13 carbon 14 and tritium as well as a geochemical modelling and analysis of the paleogeographic evolution of this area over the past several years 2 hydrogeological setting the coastal detritic aquifer of cabo de gata lies in the extreme south east of the iberian peninsula spain this region is characterized by one of the lowest rates of precipitation in europe averaging 150 mm y ruiz sinoga and martínez murillo 2009 making it an arid area whose groundwater resources are vital to its socio economic development the climate is dry and hot with an average annual temperature of 18 5 c and annual solar hours of 2960 its surface extension 25 km2 lies entirely within a natural park which confers it a certain degree of protection nevertheless given the scarce recharge from precipitation this aquifer is in a state of overexploitation garcía garcía et al 2003 the aquifer extends ne sw bounded to the east by the volcanic uplands of the sierra de cabo de gata to the west by the carboneras fault a tectonic feature that is a sinistral fault of more than 100 km long scotney et al 2000 and to the south by the mediterranean sea fig 1 the surface geology is dominated inland by alluvial deposits from the erosion of the surrounding relief while the coastal plain is covered by present day and sub fossil eolic dunes that overlie old marine terraces from the upper pleistocene dating from 250 to 95 ka hillaire marcel et al 1986 in the zone of intersection between the alluvial deposits and the marine dunes and terraces there are fine silt and clay sediments which have been interpreted as deposits from a former holocene lagoon goy et al 1998 sola et al 2014 there is currently another coastal lagoon more than 3 km long on the se edge of the aquifer the study area lies in the extreme sw fig 1 the elevation of this coastal plain varies from the sea level to 10 m amsl in the inner part of the plain the nine boreholes situated between 350 and 650 m from the coast were used to characterize the hydrogeochemistry of the aquifer fig 2 the aquifer basically comprises of plio pleistocene conglomerate and sandstone with a mean thickness of 80 m the top of the formation comprises somewhat cemented conglomerate and beneath these is a thick layer of sandstone underlying this are intercalations of conglomerate and sand the base of the aquifer is formed by pliocene marine marl fig 2 transmissivities of the aquifer vary between 1200 and 2100 m2 day daniele et al 2011 3 materials and methods 3 1 field and laboratory hydrochemical analysis vertical logs of water temperature and conductivity were conducted in the field using a temperature conductivity multi meter solinst 107 tlc metre in boreholes located some 350 650 m from the coast the multi level sampling technique was used to collect groundwater samples from the top to the bottom of the boreholes using a discrete interval sampler solinst mod 425 to collect the samples at discrete depths in the borehole column with minimal disturbance was used the zero purge method good for sampling from short screened monitoring wells dumble 2006 groundwater was sampled in may 2008 and october 2014 table 1 the same sampling points were selected on both occasions and the samples were taken at the same depth in order to observe temporal evolution of the hydrogeochemistry a representative seawater sample was taken near the coast as well as a representative freshwater sample from the aquifer temperature electrical conductivity and ph were measured in situ alkalinity as hco3 was determined by titration at the time of sampling duplicate samples were taken filtered using a 0 45 μm millipore filter and stored in polyethylene bottles at 4 c for metal analysis to avoid absorption or precipitation the samples were acidified to ph 2 with environmental grade ultra pure nitric acid sample composition was determined using standard methods such as icp mass spectrometer and ion chromatograph acme labs vancouver canada and laboratories of the geological survey of israel a split is taken to represent the original sample the preparation process and this split are subject to qa qc control checks during the progression and prior to submission to the analytical portion if there is a non conformance to the quality standard

indices calcite dolomite gypsum and halite and mole transfers of phases under different scenarios of mineral dissolution precipitation evaporation and freshwater seawater mixing 3 2 isotopic analysis oxygen and hydrogen isotope compositions were determined using irms isotope ratio mass spectrometry following epstein and mayeda 1953 and coleman et al 1982 with an analytical uncertainty 0 1 for δ18o and 1 for δ2h tritium analyses were measured using liquid scintillation with an analytical uncertainty of 0 5 tritium units tu the 13c in samples was analyzed by continuous flow irms the analytical precision was 0 3 radiocarbon analyses were prepared in the isotope tracer technologies laboratory in canada waterloo and measured by accelerator mass spectrometry at directams laboratory in seattle with analytical error of 0 5 pmc table 2 geochemical physical processes that affect the 13c content of dic in groundwater will also affect the 14c content of the dic han et al 2014 the microbiological decomposition of organic matter can modify the isotopic composition of groundwater and hence the potential uncertainty these introduce in calculated water ages due to the formation of microbial ch4 which is highly depleted in 13c dic samples can be unusually enriched in 13c when there is a positive correlation between the δ13cdic and the concentration of methane in the groundwater 13c values can be corrected this adjustment of 13c values along with the estimations of the dead carbon input from the redox processes allows calculate 14c ages using standard groundwater age correlation models hackley et al 1992 the saline groundwater is a mixture of fresh and seawater therefore the age calculations reflect a mixing process between these two water bodies and the contribution of the two end members has to be taken into account yechieli et al 2009 a simple mass balance was used to estimate the relative part of this mixing process f sw dic sw c sw 1 f sw dic fw c fw dic mix c mix where fsw is the fraction of seawater dic is the concentration and c is the isotopic value of each component of the mixture sw is seawater fw is fresh groundwater the mixing ratio was calculated according to the observed 18o concentrations see environmental isotopes taking into account also the effect of later evaporation the data were input to a selection of models constructed in netpathxl parkhurst and charlton 2008 for the estimation of the initial activity of the tdic and groundwater ages of the mixture assuming that the mixing occur at the surface before penetration into the subsurface and therefore before the radioactive clock began to work were calculated some commonly used geochemical adjustment models were comparatively assessed in the study ingerson and pearson 1964 tamers 1975 fontes and garnier 1979 each traditional adjustment model is based on a set of assumptions regarding chemical and isotopic fractionation reactions that may affect the dic 14c content of a water sample without radioactive decay of the 14c these single sample based models rely on mass balances of major carbon species or carbon isotopes 14c and 13c of dic in water han and plummer 2016 producing an initial 14c value a0 these models have been shown to provide realistic radiocarbon ages in many studies nevertheless some variations in model output arise from changes in the values of parameters used in the models gallagher et al 2000 the most sensitive parameters controlling model output values are the 13c content of the tdic δt soil co2 δg and solid carbonates δc 4 results 4 1 groundwater characterization the analyzed groundwater exhibited a wide range of salinity ranging from brackish and saline to hypersaline according to stuyfzand s classification 1989 with salinities between 70 and 726 mmol l of cl a gradual increase in salinity was observed with depth in the ec profiles reaching a maximum at a depth of 40 50 m beneath this depth the ec remains constant down to the base of the aquifer fig 2 there is some difference in the conductivity logs between the piezometers closest to the coast and those inland so that the maximum conductivity recorded in the nearest to shore coastal piezometer is 52 ms cm compared to the 72 ms cm in the one located farthest inland the maximum conductivity values are markedly higher than seawater sw which in this part of the mediterranean is around 55 ms cm fig 2 the percentage of seawater in the samples was calculated with respect to the concentration of the cl ion appelo and postma 2005 according to the expression f sw cl sample cl f cl sea cl f 100 where fsw is the percentage of seawater clsample is the concentration of cl in the sample clsea is the concentration of cl in seawater and clf is the concentration of cl in freshwater the percentages of seawater obtained in this study range between 2 and 120 seawater with the highest values belonging to the samples taken from the deepest part of the aquifer table 1 the samples are represented on a piper diagram fig 3 a they exhibit a sodium chloride type aligned towards seawater the same trend is seen in the schoeller berkaloff diagram fig 3b in this case all the samples show parallel trends with maximum concentrations of ions cl and na k and minimum concentrations of ions hco3 and ca the concentration in meq l of the most saline samples is an order of magnitude higher than the freshest ones with some samples containing ionic concentrations greater than seawater 4 2 ionic relationships the cl ion was used as reference ion since this is a conservative ion in processes of freshwater seawater mixing appelo and postma 2005 if the chemistry of the water was essentially controlled by the freshwater seawater mixture these two would form the end members and the rest of the samples would have to be aligned between these two extremes the na cl relationship shows this type of trend whereby the majority of samples are distributed between the freshwater and seawater end members however there is a group of samples where both ions exceed the values for seawater the same occurs with other ions such as mg and br fig 4 moreover there is another group of ions where the relationships with the chloride ion show another kind of trend for example the ca cl relationship shows that the line of mixing between freshwater and seawater traces a curve to which the samples that are more saline than seawater do not fit the cause of this lack of linearity could be linked to processes that act to modify the water chemistry such as cation exchange this type of trend is also seen in the graphs involving other ions like sr li b rb and si fig 4 4 3 environmental isotopes a study of the environmental isotopes 18o and 2h may help to understand the hydrogeochemical processes that have taken place in the study area and which are responsible for the enrichment observed in many of the samples the isotope values of the samples analyzed varies between 2 8 and 34 5 for 2h and between 0 31 and 6 01 for 18o table 1 fig 5 a there is no good fit in the 18o versus cl values to the theoretical mixing line between freshwater and seawater fig 5b samples with lower salinity taken from the shallower part of the aquifer tend to be located between the mediterranean meteoric water line δ2h 8δ18o 13 7 mmwl established by celle jeanton et al 2001 and the global meteoric line δ2h 8δ18o 10 gmwl craig 1961 fig 5a however samples taken from the middle and bottom of the aquifer deviate markedly from these lines even from the seawater mixing line which could indicate that these waters were subject to evaporation prior to their infiltration into the aquifer gibson et al 1993 the 18o and 2h values in seawater are clearly higher than those obtained in the remainder of the samples nevertheless the salinity of this set of samples is greater than in seawater in order to visualize this lack of correlation between sample salinities and their isotopic concentrations cl values were plotted against isotope content fig 5b the lack of correlation p value 50 r2 0 052 may be due to processes that took place before the water penetrated the aquifer once water enters the aquifer 18o behaves as a conservative ion gattacceca et al 2009 sola et al 2014 lee et al 2016 therefore the percentage of seawater in the samples was calculated using their values of 18o in the same way as was done earlier for cl for the shallowest samples the values obtained show certain differences compared to the calculations done using the cl ion however the differences are particularly striking in the case of samples from greater depths table 1 the values from this group of samples indicate a content of 55 65 seawater compared to the content of up to 120 obtained using the cl ion this observation corroborates that the high ionic concentration could be due to processes other than simple mixing with seawater 4 4 groundwater dating five samples of aquifer were analyzed for 14c results are expressed as percent modern carbon pmc representing the proportion of 14c activity in the sample compared to the 14c standard activity table 2 presents the values obtained for the analyzed samples the 14cdic values in the groundwater samples show a wide range of values between 6 and 57 pmc the freshwater sample is characterized by a relativity high value 57 pmc the lowest 14cdic values below 10 pmc are found in the most saline samples of groundwater the initial activity of 14c a0 and the age were calculated using netpath code according to the models of tamers 1975 ingerson and pearson 1964 and fontes and garnier 1979 the non presence of 3h in most of the groundwater samples suggests ages of more than 50 years the determination of the real age of saline groundwater is complicated there are several possible sources of carbon that can influence the 14c values besides the process of decay these include fresh groundwater with variable 14c activity seawater with variable 14c activity carbon from organic matter within both the marine and the continental sediments and inorganic carbon mostly calcite also within both marine and continental sediments since the values of these components are not well known it is difficult to determine their relative contribution yechieli et al 2001 the mixing process has to be considered in the 14cdic dating the age of the mixture after evaporation that penetrates downward from the lagoon has been calculated the initial values of each end member in that mixture are calculated by conducting a mass balance the dilution of 55 seawater having dic concentrations of 2 7 mmol l and δ13cdic of 0 with 45 fresh groundwater with a dic concentration of 6 1 mmol l and δ13cdic of about 9 4 yields saline groundwater with 4 2 mmol l dic and δ13cdic of about 6 2 the 14c ages of the samples were determined using the carbonate dissolution correction factor calculation proposed by fontes and garnier 1979 based on their δ13c and 14c content for this calculation certain values had to be assumed δ13cco2 was taken to be 26 kohn 2010 average c3 value vegetation that dominate this semiarid region in se spain still et al 2003 similar 13c values have also been obtained from particulate organic matter and pollen assemblages of lower holocene sediments next to the study area estiarte et al 2008 the 14c activity of the soil co2 ag was taken to be 100 pmc and the 14c activity of solid ac as 0 pmc all these values for unmeasured parameters are adopted as default by netpathxl code parkhurst and charlton 2008 the concentration of carbon of inorganic origin from calculated by ion balance and the concentration of total dissolved carbon was taken as defined by mook 1976 using this information the value of initial 14c activities a0 were calculated substituting these data into the radioactive decay equation yields a mean age for the water samples the calculated ages of these samples concur with results obtained by pearson model the results show that in general the waters are 7000 11 000 years old in the deepest part of the aquifer and 1000 years old in the middle depth table 2 however the groundwater age obtained by tamers model is older 14 000 17 000 years old possibly since this model could overestimate the groundwater age clark and fritz 1997 it is assumed that the highest 14c value 20 pmc in the sample taken in the upper part of the aquifer is related to natural mixing with younger waters 5 discussion 5 1 possible causes of the high salinity in the groundwater two hypotheses can be suggested to explain the salinity anomaly in the groundwater in the deepest part of the aquifer 1 the first hypothesis assumes that these waters are relicts of an ancient marine intrusion at the end of the last ice age 16 000 y when the sea level started to rise the highest age obtained in groundwater calculated from the 14c concentration is quite consistent with this possibility table 2 in addition during this glacial period and as a consequence of the transfer of an immense volume of seawater to the polar ice caps the salinity of seawater would have increased substantially thunell and williams 1989 emeis et al 2000 siddall et al 2003 which would explain the high salinity of water taken from the deepest part of the aquifer 2 the second hypothesis assumes that the salinity of the groundwater is due to an inflow of seawater during the peak of the flandrian transgression 6000 8000 y which was diluted by freshwater and later evaporated so increasing its salinity to higher values than seawater before it infiltrated into the aquifer other causes such as the leaching of salts from the aquifer matrix or the upwelling of deep brines through fractures have been dismissed based on knowledge of the hydrogeology of this area a series of hydrogeochemical model predictions were made to assess the validity of these hypotheses and to understand how these processes would have influenced 5 2 hydrogeochemical modelling of the hypothesis 1 old marine intrusion at the end of the last ice age the level of the mediterranean sea began to rise dramatically albeit lying tens of metres below its present day position seawater salinity in this region 10 15 ky ago calculated from the 18o content of planktonic foraminifera was 5 psu practical salinity unit higher than in the present day emeis et al 2000 this would mean that the ionic concentration of this paleo seawater would be approximately 15 greater than now fig 6 compares the expected ionic concentrations for paleo seawater 10 15 ky ago with present day concentrations and includes the concentrations in the groundwater samples the figure shows that for the conservative ions cl and br the ionic concentration of this paleo seawater 690 mmol l cl is closer to the values recorded in the aquifer than to the values for present day seawater 612 mmol l cl this hypothesis does not explain the measured isotope concentrations at the end of the last glacial period when a significant proportion of water was still bound as ice in the polar ice caps the isotopic signal of seawater was more enriched in heavy isotopes by approximately 1 the 18o compared with the present day seawater condesso de melo et al 2001 morrissey et al 2010 rodrigo gámiz et al 2011 this is not what was observed in the samples of paleowaters with ionic concentrations close to seawater which had a markedly lower isotopic concentration fig 5 5 3 hydrogeochemical modelling of the hypothesis 2 evaporated seawater in coastal aquifers where there is simple mixing of freshwater and seawater the percentage of seawater in groundwater samples calculated using their cl and 18o concentrations are very similar since both these species behave conservatively during the mixing process sola et al 2013 chandrajith et al 2014 the marked divergence that exists between the values obtained with these two methodologies is a clear indication that other processes occurred in this study area in additional to simple mixing of waters one possible cause of the discrepancy would be process of evaporation which can increase significantly the cl concentration as well as many other ions to much higher values than those measured in the seawater stumpp et al 2014 such process also affects the 18o values producing different values than those of simple mixing between freshwater and seawater hydrogeochemical modelling was undertaken using the phreeqc code parkhurst and appelo 2013 assuming that evaporation was the cause of the observed ionic enrichment the simulations began with a sample containing a percentage of seawater of around 60 this would be the percentage of seawater before evaporation according to the calculations done on the basis of 18o table 1 the evaporation also affects 18o concentration however assessing the sensitivity of both parameters cl and 18o to this process it observes that it has a minor effect on 18o concentration lee et al 2016 which explains why the measured values hardly deviate from the theoretical freshwater seawater mixing line fig 5a to achieve the same cl concentrations as measured in the deepest samples starting from an initial sample with 60 seawater it is required an evaporation of 25 35 the concentrations obtained for na mg and br after modelling this process of evaporation 25 35 of the original sample fit quite well to those measured fig 4 for this set of ions whose ionic enrichment follow linear trends from the least saline to the most saline the evaporation process would cause the same linearity and so it is difficult to establish whether this really is the cause of the ionic enrichment for the remaining ions fig 4 where the ionic enrichment linearity is less marked due to modifying processes like ionic exchange the model predictions for evaporation also give values that fit quite well this would indicate that prior to the evaporation the original sample had already been subject to processes of ionic exchange that have slightly enriched these ions the fit of the model predictions for these ions is not as close as for the previously mentioned ones in all probability the processes of cation exchange were still active after evaporation the calculated saturation indices si were compared with the model simulations assuming freshwater seawater mixing and subsequent evaporation which affects the more saline groundwater sampled from greater depth the calculated and simulated values fit quite well both for the mixing and for evaporation fig 7 to achieve similar si values to the ones measured an evaporation of 25 35 would be necessary i e the same evaporation rate obtained earlier when modelling the ionic concentration a less perfect fit is produced with the carbonate minerals especially in the case of calcite which could be related to ph variations since small variations in ph can cause significant changes in the si 5 4 paleoenvironmental interpretation the good fit between the measured and simulated samples is an indicator that the deepest samples were derived from an original water containing 60 seawater which later evaporated by 25 35 this assumes that at some point during its geological history the water was exposed to evaporation firstly this water was affected by freshwater seawater mixing processes in the aquifer as well as processes of ionic exchange in certain ions like ca and sr this mixture of freshwater with seawater later undergoes evaporation which is typical of coastal lagoon environments mollema et al 2013 re et al 2013 stumpp et al 2014 approximately 1 5 km northeast of the study area lies a topographical depression filled with sediments deposited 6500 yr bp in an old holocene coastal lagoon fig 1 goy et al 1998 this would be an appropriate place for the evaporation that was predicted by the models the lagoon would have been fed by groundwater which would have characteristics that correspond to the freshwater seawater mixing zone containing around 60 seawater fig 8 having emerged on the surface the water would have been concentrated giving rise to a water with a salinity higher than that of seawater and this would then have infiltrated and descended due to its higher density to the lowest part of the aquifer giving rise to the particular hydrochemistry that was analyzed in the samples taken from the base of the aquifer in the lowest part of the aquifer the water could again be subject to processes of ionic exchange which would slightly modify its chemistry further others authors also identify salty waters related to an old coastal lagoon petelet giraud et al 2016 it is necessary to understand the paleogeography of the area during the holocene in order to explain how in the past some 200 600 m from the coast which is where the sampled boreholes are situated there could be water with high seawater percentages around this date which corresponds to the age of the lagoon sediments and could also be the age of the waters sampled according to fontes garnier and pearson models even though the age by tamers model is older and likely overestimated the sea level was 1 2 m above its current level as a consequence of the flandrian transgression compton 2001 dechnik et al 2015 harris et al 2015 detailed sedimentological studies with accurate isotopic dating show that the sea level was at least 1 m above the present in this region goy et al 2003 this fact means that large areas of low lying land like the coastal plain in this study would have been submerged our reconstruction of the paleogeography of the study area can be seen in fig 8 and assumes a sea level that was two metres above the current level a marine incursion would have penetrated the northern part of the study area leaving it as an emerged area partially surrounded by seawater in such a context it is easy to understand how the groundwater within the study area might contain the percentage of seawater that was calculated from the isotope data this configuration would also explain why the boreholes situated further to the north and away from the present day coastline yield higher salinity values than those to the south fig 2 6 conclusions the results suggest that the elevated salinity of waters in the deepest parts of the cabo de gata coastal aquifer is a product of its geological evolution and of sea level changes in this area after the last ice age we postulate two hypotheses to explain the anomalous salinity of groundwater in this aquifer the first assumes that the water is ancient seawater from the end of the last ice age a moment in time when the mediterranean sea had an ion concentration somewhat higher than in the present day and similar to those measured in the deepest samples however the isotope data do not support this hypothesis the second hypothesis assumes that this water is a product of freshwater seawater mixing that was subsequently subject to evaporation in a coastal lagoon this hypothesis seems more consistent with the close fit between the measured values and those simulated both for the concentrations of major and minor ions and for the results of the isotope analysis moreover the geological and sedimentological evidence also support the idea that during the flandrian transgression a coastal lagoon would have developed in this area where the evaporation processes reproduced in the modelling would have taken place the beginning of the clock is at the time of penetration of the lagoon water after mixing and evaporation already occurred acknowledgements this work takes part of the general research lines promoted by the cei mar campus of international excellence and it was supported by mineco

7478,the groundwater of the cabo de gata detritic aquifer in southeastern spain exhibit salinities of between 70 726 mmol l of cl brackish salt to hypersaline waters we have investigated the causes of the high salinity anomaly which at certain points exceeds that of present day seawater 600 mmol l two hypotheses are considered as possible sources for the saline water 1 the deeper more saline groundwater date back to an old marine intrusion that occurred at the end of the last ice age 14 17 ka when seawater salinity was higher than in the present day this hypothesis is supported by the values of 14c measured in this water 6 10 pmc which indicate old water of up to 17 ka however the values of 18o and 2h are lower than would be expected 2 the water is the result of mixing between fresh groundwater and seawater the latter explanation agrees well with the low values of 18o and 2h this mixture is later subject to evaporation explaining its high salinity hydrogeochemical modelling was carried out for the most saline samples assuming such mixing between freshwater and seawater followed by evaporation and the results show a very good agreement between the measured and simulated values according to the model calculation the original mixture contained approximately 60 seawater and its volume subsequently was reduced through evaporation by around 30 this mixing and evaporation could occur during the flandrian transgression 6000 8000 y when this area accommodated a coastal lagoon keywords hydrogeochemical modelling groundwater age evaporation paleohydrology coastal lagoon 1 introduction marine intrusion and salinization of coastal aquifers is one of the most worrying environmental problems faced in coastal areas throughout the world ferguson and gleeson 2012 werner et al 2013 colombani et al 2016 nevertheless the high salinities that exhibit some coastal aquifers are not due to deficient management by human or to the effect of sea level rise as a consequence of anthropogenic climate change provoked by man there are numerous examples of elevated groundwater salinity due to natural interactions between the groundwater and the matrix rock daniele et al 2013 mollema et al 2013 carreira et al 2014 or as legacies of its geological past edmunds 2001 raidla et al 2009 cary et al 2015 the position of the fresh saline water interface has been under continuous dynamic evolution throughout the entire quaternary as a consequence of the wide fluctuations in sea level that occurred over this period which have also entailed salinity changes in the seawater thunell and williams 1989 emeis et al 2000 holloway et al 2016 these fluctuations which could have reached as much as 130 m e g chappell et al 1996 meant that large areas of coastal plains and platforms emerged above or were submerged below sea level and large aquifer volumes as well attempts have been made to mathematically simulate the effect of these sea level variations on the position of the interface both for past fluctuations delsman et al 2014 and as predictions for the future yechieli et al 2010 ketabchi et al 2016 the rate of these fluctuations can be very high at certain times with rises of up to 10 mm y 1 having been recorded camoin et al 2012 the stabilization of the freshwater seawater interface in the new conditions can be markedly slower than the variations in sea level being a function of parameters such as horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer and the rate of recharge groen et al 2000 kooi et al 2000 thus it is possible that the position of the interface is not in equilibrium with the current sea level as occurs over wide areas along the atlantic coastline of the usa meisler et al 1984 south america groen et al 2000 and in low altitude active areas such as bangladesh worland et al 2015 alternatively lenses of water may exist in low permeability areas with salinities different from what would be expected where the freshwater has not completely flushed the aquifer to displace the salt water or vice versa capaccioni et al 2005 sola et al 2013 currell et al 2015 cases of ancient seawater trapped in coastal aquifers are common throughout the world but showing different situations highly karstified massifs invaded by seawater khaska et al 2013 seawater trapped in low permeability layers of coastal

al 2015 lee et al 2016 old saline water 10 000 years with salinity of about half that of seawater was also found in several sub aquifers in the israeli coastal aquifer where it was explained by seawater intrusion as a result of the last sea level rise yechieli et al 2009 the presence of water with an anomalous salinity in relation to the present day coastline implies that coastal aquifers are naturally complex systems that may be far from the general model of two water masses of differing density separated by a clear interface custodio 2004 post 2004 for this reason detailed studies including dating using isotope data from the aquifer water become a necessity if the approximate geological evolution of an aquifer system from the present day observations needs to be gained love et al 1994 yechieli et al 2009 lee et al 2016 the objective of this study is to understand the influence of past and present day marine intrusion processes and to elucidate the reason for its high salinity higher than seawater preliminary work was done by means of hydrochemical and isotopic analyses sola et al 2014 in order to achieve a better understanding of the processes that affect to this aquifer system a new sampling campaign done including new isotopes carbon 13 carbon 14 and tritium as well as a geochemical modelling and analysis of the paleogeographic evolution of this area over the past several years 2 hydrogeological setting the coastal detritic aquifer of cabo de gata lies in the extreme south east of the iberian peninsula spain this region is characterized by one of the lowest rates of precipitation in europe averaging 150 mm y ruiz sinoga and martínez murillo 2009 making it an arid area whose groundwater resources are vital to its socio economic development the climate is dry and hot with an average annual temperature of 18 5 c and annual solar hours of 2960 its surface extension 25 km2 lies entirely within a natural park which confers it a certain degree of protection nevertheless given the scarce recharge from precipitation this aquifer is in a state of overexploitation garcía garcía et al 2003 the aquifer extends ne sw bounded to the east by the volcanic uplands of the sierra de cabo de gata to the west by the carboneras fault a tectonic feature that is a sinistral fault of more than 100 km long scotney et al 2000 and to the south by the mediterranean sea fig 1 the surface geology is dominated inland by alluvial deposits from the erosion of the surrounding relief while the coastal plain is covered by present day and sub fossil eolic dunes that overlie old marine terraces from the upper pleistocene dating from 250 to 95 ka hillaire marcel et al 1986 in the zone of intersection between the alluvial deposits and the marine dunes and terraces there are fine silt and clay sediments which have been interpreted as deposits from a former holocene lagoon goy et al 1998 sola et al 2014 there is currently another coastal lagoon more than 3 km long on the se edge of the aquifer the study area lies in the extreme sw fig 1 the elevation of this coastal plain varies from the sea level to 10 m amsl in the inner part of the plain the nine boreholes situated between 350 and 650 m from the coast were used to characterize the hydrogeochemistry of the aquifer fig 2 the aquifer basically comprises of plio pleistocene conglomerate and sandstone with a mean thickness of 80 m the top of the formation comprises somewhat cemented conglomerate and beneath these is a thick layer of sandstone underlying this are intercalations of conglomerate and sand the base of the aquifer is formed by pliocene marine marl fig 2 transmissivities of the aquifer vary between 1200 and 2100 m2 day daniele et al 2011 3 materials and methods 3 1 field and laboratory hydrochemical analysis vertical logs of water temperature and conductivity were conducted in the field using a temperature conductivity multi meter solinst 107 tlc metre in boreholes located some 350 650 m from the coast the multi level sampling technique was used to collect groundwater samples from the top to the bottom of the boreholes using a discrete interval sampler solinst mod 425 to collect the samples at discrete depths in the borehole column with minimal disturbance was used the zero purge method good for sampling from short screened monitoring wells dumble 2006 groundwater was sampled in may 2008 and october 2014 table 1 the same sampling points were selected on both occasions and the samples were taken at the same depth in order to observe temporal evolution of the hydrogeochemistry a representative seawater sample was taken near the coast as well as a representative freshwater sample from the aquifer temperature electrical conductivity and ph were measured in situ alkalinity as hco3 was determined by titration at the time of sampling duplicate samples were taken filtered using a 0 45 μm millipore filter and stored in polyethylene bottles at 4 c for metal analysis to avoid absorption or precipitation the samples were acidified to ph 2 with environmental grade ultra pure nitric acid sample composition was determined using standard methods such as icp mass spectrometer and ion chromatograph acme labs vancouver canada and laboratories of the geological survey of israel a split is taken to represent the original sample the preparation process and this split are subject to qa qc control checks during the progression and prior to submission to the analytical portion if there is a non conformance to the quality standard the process is reviewed and corrected prheeqc version 3 parkhurst and appelo 2013 was used to calculate equilibrium concentrations of elements molalities and activities of aqueous species saturation indices calcite dolomite gypsum and halite and mole transfers of phases under different scenarios of mineral dissolution precipitation evaporation and freshwater seawater mixing 3 2 isotopic analysis oxygen and hydrogen isotope compositions were determined using irms isotope ratio mass spectrometry following epstein and mayeda 1953 and coleman et al 1982 with an analytical uncertainty 0 1 for δ18o and 1 for δ2h tritium analyses were measured using liquid scintillation with an analytical uncertainty of 0 5 tritium units tu the 13c in samples was analyzed by continuous flow irms the analytical precision was 0 3 radiocarbon analyses were prepared in the isotope tracer technologies laboratory in canada waterloo and measured by accelerator mass spectrometry at directams laboratory in seattle with analytical error of 0 5 pmc table 2 geochemical physical processes that affect the 13c content of dic in groundwater will also affect the 14c content of the dic han et al 2014 the microbiological decomposition of organic matter can modify the isotopic composition of groundwater and hence the potential uncertainty these introduce in calculated water ages due to the formation of microbial ch4 which is highly depleted in 13c dic samples can be unusually enriched in 13c when there is a positive correlation between the δ13cdic and the concentration of methane in the groundwater 13c values can be corrected this adjustment of 13c values along with the estimations of the dead carbon input from the redox processes allows calculate 14c ages using standard groundwater age correlation models hackley et al 1992 the saline groundwater is a mixture of fresh and seawater therefore the age calculations reflect a mixing process between these two water bodies and the contribution of the two end members has to be taken into account yechieli et al 2009 a simple mass balance was used to estimate the relative part of this mixing process f sw dic sw c sw 1 f sw dic fw c fw dic mix c mix where fsw is the fraction of seawater dic is the concentration and c is the isotopic value of each component of the mixture sw is seawater fw is fresh groundwater the mixing ratio was calculated according to the observed 18o concentrations see environmental isotopes taking into account also the effect of later evaporation the data were input to a selection of models constructed in netpathxl parkhurst and charlton 2008 for the estimation of the initial activity of the tdic and groundwater ages of the mixture assuming that the mixing occur at the surface before penetration into the subsurface and therefore before the radioactive clock began to work were calculated some commonly used geochemical adjustment models were comparatively assessed in the study ingerson and pearson 1964 tamers 1975 fontes and garnier 1979 each traditional adjustment model is based on a set of assumptions regarding chemical and isotopic fractionation reactions that may affect the dic 14c content of a water sample without radioactive decay of the 14c these single sample based models rely on mass balances of major carbon species or carbon isotopes 14c and 13c of dic in water han and plummer 2016 producing an initial 14c value a0 these models have been shown to provide realistic radiocarbon ages in many studies nevertheless some variations in model output arise from changes in the values of parameters used in the models gallagher et al 2000 the most sensitive parameters controlling model output values are the 13c content of the tdic δt soil co2 δg and solid carbonates δc 4 results 4 1 groundwater characterization the analyzed groundwater exhibited a wide range of salinity ranging from brackish and saline to hypersaline according to stuyfzand s classification 1989 with salinities between 70 and 726 mmol l of cl a gradual increase in salinity was observed with depth in the ec profiles reaching a maximum at a depth of 40 50 m beneath this depth the ec remains constant down to the base of the aquifer fig 2 there is some difference in the conductivity logs between the piezometers closest to the coast and those inland so that the maximum conductivity recorded in the nearest to shore coastal piezometer is 52 ms cm compared to the 72 ms cm in the one located farthest inland the maximum conductivity values are markedly higher than seawater sw which in this part of the mediterranean is around 55 ms cm fig 2 the percentage of seawater in the samples was calculated with respect to the concentration of the cl ion appelo and postma 2005 according to the expression f sw cl sample cl f cl sea cl f 100 where fsw is the percentage of seawater clsample is the concentration of cl in the sample clsea is the concentration of cl in seawater and clf is the concentration of cl in freshwater the percentages of seawater obtained in this study range between 2 and 120 seawater with the highest values belonging to the samples taken from the deepest part of the aquifer table 1 the samples are represented on a piper diagram fig 3 a they exhibit a sodium chloride type aligned towards seawater the same trend is seen in the schoeller berkaloff diagram fig 3b in this case all the samples show parallel trends with maximum concentrations of ions cl and na k and minimum concentrations of ions hco3 and ca the concentration in meq l of the most saline samples is an order of magnitude higher than the freshest ones with some samples containing ionic concentrations greater than seawater 4 2 ionic relationships the cl ion was used as reference ion since this is a conservative ion in processes of freshwater seawater mixing appelo and postma 2005 if the chemistry of the water was essentially controlled by the freshwater seawater mixture these two would form the end members and the rest of the samples would have to be aligned between these two extremes the na cl relationship shows this type of trend whereby the majority of samples are distributed between the freshwater and seawater end members however there is a group of samples where both ions exceed the values for seawater the same occurs with other ions such as mg and br fig 4 moreover there is another group of ions where the relationships with the chloride ion show another kind of trend for example the ca cl relationship shows that the line of mixing between freshwater and seawater traces a curve to which the samples that are more saline than seawater do not fit the cause of this lack of linearity could be linked to processes that act to modify the water chemistry such as cation exchange this type of trend is also seen in the graphs involving other ions like sr li b rb and si fig 4 4 3 environmental isotopes a study of the environmental isotopes 18o and 2h may help to understand the hydrogeochemical processes that have taken place in the study area and which are responsible for the enrichment observed in many of the samples the isotope values of the samples analyzed varies between 2 8 and 34 5 for 2h and between 0 31 and 6 01 for 18o table 1 fig 5 a there is no good fit in the 18o versus cl values to the theoretical mixing line between freshwater and seawater fig 5b samples with lower salinity taken from the shallower part of the aquifer tend to be located between the mediterranean meteoric water line δ2h 8δ18o 13 7 mmwl established by celle jeanton et al 2001 and the global meteoric line δ2h 8δ18o 10 gmwl craig 1961 fig 5a however samples taken from the middle and bottom of the aquifer deviate markedly from these lines even from the seawater mixing line which could indicate that these waters were subject to evaporation prior to their infiltration into the aquifer gibson et al 1993 the 18o and 2h values in seawater are clearly higher than those obtained in the remainder of the samples nevertheless the salinity of this set of samples is greater than in seawater in order to visualize this lack of correlation between sample salinities and their isotopic concentrations cl values were plotted against isotope content fig 5b the lack of correlation p value 50 r2 0 052 may be due to processes that took place before the water penetrated the aquifer once water enters the aquifer 18o behaves as a conservative ion gattacceca et al 2009 sola et al 2014 lee et al 2016 therefore the percentage of seawater in the samples was calculated using their values of 18o in the same way as was done earlier for cl for the shallowest samples the values obtained show certain differences compared to the calculations done using the cl ion however the differences are particularly striking in the case of samples from greater depths table 1 the values from this group of samples indicate a content of 55 65 seawater compared to the content of up to 120 obtained using the cl ion this observation corroborates that the high ionic concentration could be due to processes other than simple mixing with seawater 4 4 groundwater dating five samples of aquifer were analyzed for 14c results are expressed as percent modern carbon pmc representing the proportion of 14c activity in the sample compared to the 14c standard activity table 2 presents the values obtained for the analyzed samples the 14cdic values in the groundwater samples show a wide range of values between 6 and 57 pmc the freshwater sample is characterized by a relativity high value 57 pmc the lowest 14cdic values below 10 pmc are found in the most saline samples of groundwater the initial activity of 14c a0 and the age were calculated using netpath code according to the models of tamers 1975 ingerson and pearson 1964 and fontes and garnier 1979 the non presence of 3h in most of the groundwater samples suggests ages of more than 50 years the determination of the real age of saline groundwater is complicated there are several possible sources of carbon that can influence the 14c values besides the process of decay these include fresh groundwater with variable 14c activity seawater with variable 14c activity carbon from organic matter within both the marine and the continental sediments and inorganic carbon mostly calcite also within both marine and continental sediments since the values of these components are not well known it is difficult to determine their relative contribution yechieli et al 2001 the mixing process has to be considered in the 14cdic dating the age of the mixture after evaporation that penetrates downward from the lagoon has been calculated the initial values of each end member in that mixture are calculated by conducting a mass balance the dilution of 55 seawater having dic concentrations of 2 7 mmol l and δ13cdic of 0 with 45 fresh groundwater with a dic concentration of 6 1 mmol l and δ13cdic of about 9 4 yields saline groundwater with 4 2 mmol l dic and δ13cdic of about 6 2 the 14c ages of the samples were determined using the carbonate dissolution correction factor calculation proposed by fontes and garnier 1979 based on their δ13c and 14c content for this calculation certain values had to be assumed δ13cco2 was taken to be 26 kohn 2010 average c3 value vegetation that dominate this semiarid region in se spain still et al 2003 similar 13c values have also been obtained from particulate organic matter and pollen assemblages of lower holocene sediments next to the study area estiarte et al 2008 the 14c activity of the soil co2 ag was taken to be 100 pmc and the 14c activity of solid ac as 0 pmc all these values for unmeasured parameters are adopted as default by netpathxl code parkhurst and charlton 2008 the concentration of carbon of inorganic origin from calculated by ion balance and the concentration of total dissolved carbon was taken as defined by mook 1976 using this information the value of initial 14c activities a0 were calculated substituting these data into the radioactive decay equation yields a mean age for the water samples the calculated ages of these samples concur with results obtained by pearson model the results show that in general the waters are 7000 11 000 years old in the deepest part of the aquifer and 1000 years old in the middle depth table 2 however the groundwater age obtained by tamers model is older 14 000 17 000 years old possibly since this model could overestimate the groundwater age clark and fritz 1997 it is assumed that the highest 14c value 20 pmc in the sample taken in the upper part of the aquifer is related to natural mixing with younger waters 5 discussion 5 1 possible causes of the high salinity in the groundwater two hypotheses can be suggested to explain the salinity anomaly in the groundwater in the deepest part of the aquifer 1 the first hypothesis assumes that these waters are relicts of an ancient marine intrusion at the end of the last ice age 16 000 y when the sea level started to rise the highest age obtained in groundwater calculated from the 14c concentration is quite consistent with this possibility table 2 in addition during this glacial period and as a consequence of the transfer of an immense volume of seawater to the polar ice caps the salinity of seawater would have increased substantially thunell and williams 1989 emeis et al 2000 siddall et al 2003 which would explain the high salinity of water taken from the deepest part of the aquifer 2 the second hypothesis assumes that the salinity of the groundwater is due to an inflow of seawater during the peak of the flandrian transgression 6000 8000 y which was diluted by freshwater and later evaporated so increasing its salinity to higher values than seawater before it infiltrated into the aquifer other causes such as the leaching of salts from the aquifer matrix or the upwelling of deep brines through fractures have been dismissed based on knowledge of the hydrogeology of this area a series of hydrogeochemical model predictions were made to assess the validity of these hypotheses and to understand how these processes would have influenced 5 2 hydrogeochemical modelling of the hypothesis 1 old marine intrusion at the end of the last ice age the level of the mediterranean sea began to rise dramatically albeit lying tens of metres below its present day position seawater salinity in this region 10 15 ky ago calculated from the 18o content of planktonic foraminifera was 5 psu practical salinity unit higher than in the present day emeis et al 2000 this would mean that the ionic concentration of this paleo seawater would be approximately 15 greater than now fig 6 compares the expected ionic concentrations for paleo seawater 10 15 ky ago with present day concentrations and includes the concentrations in the groundwater samples the figure shows that for the conservative ions cl and br the ionic concentration of this paleo seawater 690 mmol l cl is closer to the values recorded in the aquifer than to the values for present day seawater 612 mmol l cl this hypothesis does not explain the measured isotope concentrations at the end of the last glacial period when a significant proportion of water was still bound as ice in the polar ice caps the isotopic signal of seawater was more enriched in heavy isotopes by approximately 1 the 18o compared with the present day seawater condesso de melo et al 2001 morrissey et al 2010 rodrigo gámiz et al 2011 this is not what was observed in the samples of paleowaters with ionic concentrations close to seawater which had a markedly lower isotopic concentration fig 5 5 3 hydrogeochemical modelling of the hypothesis 2 evaporated seawater in coastal aquifers where there is simple mixing of freshwater and seawater the percentage of seawater in groundwater samples calculated using their cl and 18o concentrations are very similar since both these species behave conservatively during the mixing process sola et al 2013 chandrajith et al 2014 the marked divergence that exists between the values obtained with these two methodologies is a clear indication that other processes occurred in this study area in additional to simple mixing of waters one possible cause of the discrepancy would be process of evaporation which can increase significantly the cl concentration as well as many other ions to much higher values than those measured in the seawater stumpp et al 2014 such process also affects the 18o values producing different values than those of simple mixing between freshwater and seawater hydrogeochemical modelling was undertaken using the phreeqc code parkhurst and appelo 2013 assuming that evaporation was the cause of the observed ionic enrichment the simulations began with a sample containing a percentage of seawater of around 60 this would be the percentage of seawater before evaporation according to the calculations done on the basis of 18o table 1 the evaporation also affects 18o concentration however assessing the sensitivity of both parameters cl and 18o to this process it observes that it has a minor effect on 18o concentration lee et al 2016 which explains why the measured values hardly deviate from the theoretical freshwater seawater mixing line fig 5a to achieve the same cl concentrations as measured in the deepest samples starting from an initial sample with 60 seawater it is required an evaporation of 25 35 the concentrations obtained for na mg and br after modelling this process of evaporation 25 35 of the original sample fit quite well to those measured fig 4 for this set of ions whose ionic enrichment follow linear trends from the least saline to the most saline the evaporation process would cause the same linearity and so it is difficult to establish whether this really is the cause of the ionic enrichment for the remaining ions fig 4 where the ionic enrichment linearity is less marked due to modifying processes like ionic exchange the model predictions for evaporation also give values that fit quite well this would indicate that prior to the evaporation the original sample had already been subject to processes of ionic exchange that have slightly enriched these ions the fit of the model predictions for these ions is not as close as for the previously mentioned ones in all probability the processes of cation exchange were still active after evaporation the calculated saturation indices si were compared with the model simulations assuming freshwater seawater mixing and subsequent evaporation which affects the more saline groundwater sampled from greater depth the calculated and simulated values fit quite well both for the mixing and for evaporation fig 7 to achieve similar si values to the ones measured an evaporation of 25 35 would be necessary i e the same evaporation rate obtained earlier when modelling the ionic concentration a less perfect fit is produced with the carbonate minerals especially in the case of calcite which could be related to ph variations since small variations in ph can cause significant changes in the si 5 4 paleoenvironmental interpretation the good fit between the measured and simulated samples is an indicator that the deepest samples were derived from an original water containing 60 seawater which later evaporated by 25 35 this assumes that at some point during its geological history the water was exposed to evaporation firstly this water was affected by freshwater seawater mixing processes in the aquifer as well as processes of ionic exchange in certain ions like ca and sr this mixture of freshwater with seawater later undergoes evaporation which is typical of coastal lagoon environments mollema et al 2013 re et al 2013 stumpp et al 2014 approximately 1 5 km northeast of the study area lies a topographical depression filled with sediments deposited 6500 yr bp in an old holocene coastal lagoon fig 1 goy et al 1998 this would be an appropriate place for the evaporation that was predicted by the models the lagoon would have been fed by groundwater which would have characteristics that correspond to the freshwater seawater mixing zone containing around 60 seawater fig 8 having emerged on the surface the water would have been concentrated giving rise to a water with a salinity higher than that of seawater and this would then have infiltrated and descended due to its higher density to the lowest part of the aquifer giving rise to the particular hydrochemistry that was analyzed in the samples taken from the base of the aquifer in the lowest part of the aquifer the water could again be subject to processes of ionic exchange which would slightly modify its chemistry further others authors also identify salty waters related to an old coastal lagoon petelet giraud et al 2016 it is necessary to understand the paleogeography of the area during the holocene in order to explain how in the past some 200 600 m from the coast which is where the sampled boreholes are situated there could be water with high seawater percentages around this date which corresponds to the age of the lagoon sediments and could also be the age of the waters sampled according to fontes garnier and pearson models even though the age by tamers model is older and likely overestimated the sea level was 1 2 m above its current level as a consequence of the flandrian transgression compton 2001 dechnik et al 2015 harris et al 2015 detailed sedimentological studies with accurate isotopic dating show that the sea level was at least 1 m above the present in this region goy et al 2003 this fact means that large areas of low lying land like the coastal plain in this study would have been submerged our reconstruction of the paleogeography of the study area can be seen in fig 8 and assumes a sea level that was two metres above the current level a marine incursion would have penetrated the northern part of the study area leaving it as an emerged area partially surrounded by seawater in such a context it is easy to understand how the groundwater within the study area might contain the percentage of seawater that was calculated from the isotope data this configuration would also explain why the boreholes situated further to the north and away from the present day coastline yield higher salinity values than those to the south fig 2 6 conclusions the results suggest that the elevated salinity of waters in the deepest parts of the cabo de gata coastal aquifer is a product of its geological evolution and of sea level changes in this area after the last ice age we postulate two hypotheses to explain the anomalous salinity of groundwater in this aquifer the first assumes that the water is ancient seawater from the end of the last ice age a moment in time when the mediterranean sea had an ion concentration somewhat higher than in the present day and similar to those measured in the deepest samples however the isotope data do not support this hypothesis the second hypothesis assumes that this water is a product of freshwater seawater mixing that was subsequently subject to evaporation in a coastal lagoon this hypothesis seems more consistent with the close fit between the measured values and those simulated both for the concentrations of major and minor ions and for the results of the isotope analysis moreover the geological and sedimentological evidence also support the idea that during the flandrian transgression a coastal lagoon would have developed in this area where the evaporation processes reproduced in the modelling would have taken place the beginning of the clock is at the time of penetration of the lagoon water after mixing and evaporation already occurred acknowledgements this work takes part of the general research lines promoted by the cei mar campus of international excellence and it was supported by mineco

7479,precipitation plays an important role in both environment and human society and is a significant factor in many scientific researches such as water resources agriculture and climate impact studies the onset and retreat of rainy season are useful features to understand the variability of precipitation under the influence of climate change in this study the characteristics of onset and retreat in mainland china are investigated the multi scale moving t test was applied to determine rainy season and k means cluster analysis was used to divide china into sub regions to better investigate rainy season features the possible linkage of changing characteristics of onset and retreat to climate factors were also explored results show that 1 the onset started from middle march in the southeast of china to early june in the northwest and rainy season ended earliest in the northwest and southeast while the central china had the latest retreat 2 delayed onset and advanced retreat over time were observed in many parts of china together with overall stable or increased rainy season precipitation would likely lead to higher probability of flooding 3 the onset retreat was associated with the increased decreased number of cyclones in eastern china and anticyclone near the south china sea delayed onset and advanced retreat were likely related to cold and warm sea surface temperature sst in the conventional el niño southern oscillation enso regions respectively these results suggest that predictability of rainy season can be improved through the atmospheric circulation and sst and help water resources management and agricultural planning keywords rainy season onset retreat moving t test atmospheric circulation sst 1 introduction precipitation is one of the most important variable responding to climate change which has attracted urgent attention worldwide various aspects of precipitation have been investigated such as seasonality and extremes ashok et al 2009 feng et al 2011 ratnam et al 2011 su et al 2005 taschetto and england 2009 tedeschi et al 2013 wang et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 unfortunately characteristics of rainy season are less considered but are of vital significance to influence socio economy reliable prediction of the onset of rainy season will reduce the risk of improper planting sowing time and assist on time preparation of farmlands liebmann and marengo 2001 marteau et al 2011 omotosho et al 2000 a good knowledge of the retreat of rainy season is useful for the selection of crop varieties and has significant impact to ecosystem liebmann et al 2007 rainy season precipitation will also provide certain predictability for flood occurrence and be helpful to flood monitoring the variability of onset and retreat of rainy season and the total precipitation amount during rainy season are also direct indications for climate change and provide good scientific support to socio economic development and climate change research for a large region like china as a whole rainy season varies substantially in both space and time previous researches have been limited to the analysis of the total precipitation during rainy season and ignored the onset and retreat many works were focused on regional scales e g northwestern china the yangtze river basin and the coastal areas chen et al 2007 gemmer et al 2011 su et al 2005 wang et al 2013 zhang et al 2009 without the consideration of spatial heterogeneity which is an important factor for the continental scale hence the investigation of rainy season features variability such as the onset and retreat is necessary in china at the continental scale in order to gain insight of rainfall characteristics there has not been a consensus agreement regarding to the determination of rainy season due to irregularities in rainfall distribution in both space and time in literature the determination of rainy season can be based on rainfall data temperature deep convection monsoon or combination of several indices cook and heerdegen 2001 gan et al 2004 2005 goswami and xavier 2005 janowiak and xie 2003 liebmann et al 2007 qian and lee 2000 reason et al 2005 the majority of research used threshold values of a given index or indices to determine the onset and retreat which is somewhat subjective therefore a data originated objective method called the multi scale moving t test was used in this study to detect rainy season the onset and retreat defined by this method does not require an ad hoc threshold as in most traditional definitions there are also some other statistically based methods used to detect the rainy season such as the optimal segmentation method of ordered sample which can further divide the rainy season into several sub periods nonetheless this paper is just focused on the onset and retreat rather than the detailed types of rainy season therefore the multi scale moving t test is better for this research over others based on literature in order to understand the driving factors or the causes of the change in rainy season the correlations with monsoon and sea surface temperature sst are evaluated as they are the main factors influencing rainy season characteristics of china deng and wang 2002 ding and chan 2005 liu and ding 2008 lu 2005 wang and linho 2002 wang et al 2004 2002 yang and lau 2004 zhao et al 2010 from a meteorological perspective the onset and retreat reflect the changes in an atmospheric heat source whose addition or subtraction can alter large scale and regional circulation figueroa et al 1995 lenters and cook 1997 sst is important for developing and maintaining atmospheric circulations fan et al 2013 previous research have found that rainy season precipitation in china shows good relation to sst e g deng and wang 2002 as a consequence it is meaningful to investigate signals of rainy season characteristics through monsoon and lag period sst in this paper we will explore features of rainy season in mainland china at the continental scale the homogeneous regions will be determined based on rainy season characteristics including the onset retreat and rainy season precipitation the interannual variability of rainy season within individual homogeneous regions will be further investigated we will also explore the possible correlation of the onset and retreat with monsoon and sst to understand the signals of variability of the onset and retreat this study is of importance for helping us to provide a certain predictability to flooding occurrence and of great significance to

includes the multi scale moving t test section 3 1 to determine the onsets and retreats of rainy season k means cluster analysis method section 3 2 to divide the mainland china into several obtain homogeneous sub regions according to rainy season features i e the onset retreat and precipitation trend analysis and pettitt test for abrupt point analysis section 3 3 of rainy season characteristics in individual sub regions and pearson coefficient correlations section 3 4 to explain the underlying relationship between rainy season characteristics and sst 3 1 determination of onset and retreat the multi scale moving t test method was applied to determine the onset and retreat by detecting the most significant change between two subsamples before and after the abruption point with equal sample sizes n where n is the length of the subsample n 30 31 182 or 183 here 182 or 183 corresponds to half the value of length of one year 365 or 366 theoretically the length of subsamples ranged from 1 to 182 183 nonetheless for the onset or retreat of rainy season it is not reasonable if the length of the subsample is just one day or several days when the mutation point is prominent hence the length of the subsample is limited from 30 to 182 183 the multi scale abruption points can be detected as fraedrich et al 1997 1 t n i x i 2 x i 1 n 1 2 s i 2 2 s i 1 2 1 2 where x i 1 and x i 2 defined as 2 x i 1 j i n i 1 x j n s i 1 2 j i n i 1 x j x i 1 2 n 1 3 x i 2 j i i n 1 x j n s i 2 2 j i i n 1 x j x i 2 2 n 1 and xi is daily precipitation for julian day i for one station within one year x i 1 and x i 2 are averaged values of subsamples before and after the julian day i respectively the t value was normalized by the 0 01 test value showing in eq 4 which is equivalent to the results of the mann kendall test at 0 05 significance level 4 t r n i t n i t 0 01 n where t r n i can be considered as the threshold to detect abruption points t r n i 1 0 is an increasing trend while t r n i 1 0 is a decreasing trend the onset of rainy season was defined as the abruption point corresponding to a maximum t r n i value where precipitation changes from a smaller to a larger value likewise the retreat is defined as the changing point corresponding to a minimum t r n i value taking daily precipitation data in one year at one station which is selected from region 1 classified in fig 4 as an example to present the determination of the onset and retreat fig 2 a the yellow greenish lines denote positive t r n i values and the blue lines denote negative values fig 2a reveals that the maximum value of t r n i is 1 35 when the corresponding julian day is 106 and the corresponding timescale is 96 it means that the onset date of rainy season is julian day 106 which shows the most conspicuous abruption in the timescale of 96 days similarly the retreat date of rainy season is julian day 260 3 2 k means cluster analysis for regionalization it is necessary to divide china into sub regions to explore rainy season features due to the heterogeneity of chinese rainy season characteristics previous studies have used administration or climatic zones as the criteria to determine homogeneous sub regions however they are not statistically sound because they do not directly reflect rainy season characteristics from observations in this study the k means clustering with factors of the onset retreat of rainy season and total precipitation during rainy season is used to determine the homogeneous sub regions due to high efficiency in dealing with large amount of data k means cluster algorithm aims to find a partition so that the squared error between empirical mean of a cluster and points in the cluster is minimized the squared error is defined as jain 2010 5 j c k x i c k x i μ k 2 where x i are parameters i e mean onset retreat and rainy season precipitation for the period of 1960 2015 in i th station x x i i 1 n is clustered into a set of k clusters μ k is the mean value of cluster c k j c k the squared error of cluster c k where c c k k 1 k the objective of k means cluster analysis is to minimize the sum of squared error in all k clusters 6 j c k 1 k x i c k x i μ k 2 in this study k is equal to 5 considering the number of administration and climate zones in china 3 3 pettitt test for change point analysis within the homogeneous sub regions the features of rainy season i e the onset retreat and total precipitation evaluated over time pettit test was applied to detect a single change point in interannual onset retreat precipitation series in order to evaluate the influence of climate change on rainy season more than one change points can be detected if other methods such as the mann kendall test are used the reason why choosing the pettitt test is that we want to detect the most prominent change point pettitt test was used to detect a single abruption point in interannual onset retreat precipitation series xi i 1 2 56 where xi represents the mean onset retreat precipitation of stations in one sub region and for i th year the non parametric statistic is defined as follows pettitt 1979 7 k t max u t t where 8 u t t i 1 t j t 1 t sgn x i x j kt can be considered as the abruption point of series and the result is meaningful when kt 0 5 the parameter p is applied to judge the significant level of the abruption point which is defined as 9 p 2 exp 6 k t 2 n 3 n 2 and n 56 in this study when p is 0 05 it means that the change point is significant at the significance level of 0 05 3 4 correlation evaluation between onset retreat and sst the pearson liner correlation coefficients between rainy season characteristics and sst were evaluated the pearson liner correlation coefficient r can be calculated as pearson 1895 10

1959 2014 4 results and discussion 4 1 regionalization of mainland china the average onset dates of rainy season during 1960 2015 in china varied from julian day 75 155 fig 3 a the onset progressed northwestwards from mid march in coastal regions in the southeast to the beginning of june in the northwest the central and northeastern regions of china had median onset ranging from mid april to mid may different methods to define summer monsoon onset dates related to the rainy season have been presented in previous studies for example wang and linho 2002 designed a compound rainfall variable which can synthesize three characteristics i e the total amount of summer rainfall the annual range of rainfall and the seasonal distribution of rainfall to determine the onset of rainy season their results show that the asian monsoon rainy season begins over the south china sea and then advances northwestwards which is in accordance with our research rainy season ended earliest in the southeast as well fig 3b with the retreat occurring in late july overall the retreat progressed from the coastal areas to central china 100 e 110 e 20 n 35 n and shrank from the central regions to the northwest with rainy season ending in september and october in central china and late july and august in the northwest the distribution of precipitation is similar to the onset fig 3c with rainy season precipitation shrinking from southeast 1500 1800 mm to northwest 2 300 mm in summary rainy season started and ended earliest in coastal regions and had largest amount of rainy season precipitation central china had median values of onset and precipitation with latest retreat northwestern china had smallest precipitation and latest onset dates the spatial pattern of rainy season characteristics are generally consistent with the research of deng and wang 2002 who argued that rainfall in china mainly occurs in may to july may september in the southeastern and southern regions it can be seen that the features of rainy season in china vary in space the regionalization of mainland china therefore is necessary in order to describe interannual rainy season characteristics in different regions k means clustering method was applied to divide china into sub regions that have coherent onset retreat and precipitation features this classification is based on mean values of multi year onset retreat of the rainy season and precipitation during the rainy season each station has three parameters i e mean onset retreat and rainy season precipitation for the period of 1960 2015 which are used to cluster similar stations geographic homogeneity of these stations were also considered in division mainland china is divided into five regions fig 4 region 1 contains mainly the northwestern china and region 2 includes northeastern china the yellow river basin and northern parts of huaihe river basin region 3 contains southern regions of the huaihe river basin and the northern part of the yangtze river basin region 4 includes southern regions of the yangtze river basin and region 5 includes southeastern china the regionalization in fig 4 is in accordance with the changing pattern of east asian summer monsoon easm given in ding and chan 2005 zhao et al 2016 also showed that easm makes a great contribution to the atmospheric moisture and precipitation in china notably the easm exhibits some patterns of the onset and retreat moreover rainy season in the mainland china also closely relates to easm which will be further presented in section 4 3 4 2 interannual variability the interannual variability of rainy season is provided in fig 5 which displays the time series of average onset retreat and rainy season precipitation within the five homogeneous regions from 1960 to 2015 the mean values are determined for each observation station and then averaged for all stations within each region pettitt test was applied to detect the abruption point of rainy season characteristics in each region in terms of the onset fig 5 there is no evidence of a long term tendency and no abruption point in regions 1 for the period of 1960 2015 with the average values of onset julian day 132 in recent two decades however region 1 displayed obvious delayed trend region 2 had a significant mutation point in year 1997 at the level of 0 1 region 3 had an earlier abruption year 1979 in comparison with region 2 before which the onset had a stable level in april the onset had an advanced trend for the period of 1979 2002 followed by a delayed tendency for 2002 2015 region 4 displayed similarity to region 2 with respect to the occurrence time of mutation year 1996 in region 4 and the variation of onset stabilizing before mutation the onset in region 4 had an overall delayed trend for the period of 1960 2015 there is no obvious tendency and no abruption point in regions 5 with the average values of onset julian day 107 the retreat had an abruption point year 1983 in region 1 which is statistically significant at the significance level of 5 the retreat dates advanced approximately a month for 1984 2015 as compared to 1960 1983 shi et al 2006 found that the climate change in northwest china is most notably in the year 1987 which is consistent with mutation points detected in this study year 1983 for retreat and year 1991 for precipitation it can be seen that the trends of rainy season features in china may be attributed to climate change region 2 had the largest variation around the mutation point year 1976 the fluctuation is gradually shrinking and has a tendency to stabilize at the level of late september after 1976 similarly the retreat fluctuated largely in region 3 before 2001 followed by decreasing scale of variation regions 4 and 5 had no abruption point and no obvious trend of advance or delay precipitation in region 1 displayed the most distinctive abruption at the year of 1991 and is significant at the level of 1 after 1991 there is an obvious precipitation increase with mean values changing from 80 mm to 98 mm per day wang et al 2013 pointed out that daily average precipitation in northwestern china from 1960 to 2009 showed increasing trend which is consistent with our research regions 2 4 had no mutation over 1960 2015 and displayed no apparent tendency rainy season precipitation in region 5 increased apparently after 1992 with average value of 1390 mm per day but the trend of precipitation is decreased ding et al 2008 and wu et al 2010 revealed that the southern part of china have undergone much more significant rainfall events and 1992 is detected as the climate changing point in the southern china which is in accordance with our research nitta and hu 1996 and qian and qin 2008 also investigated the precipitation division and climate shift in china as well their results are different from our research because of the different periods we choose such as the period of 1960 2000 was chosen in the research of qian and qin 2008 and the different division methods in summary many parts of china displayed delayed onset and advanced retreat at the interannual scale especially in recent twenty years only coastal regions and northwestern china presented increased rainy season precipitation with most parts of china had stable precipitation amount flooding is more easily trigged under such circumstances which should be paid enough attention 4 3 relationship between rainy season characteristics and atmospheric circulation and sst 4 3 1 links between the onset and retreat of rainy season and atmospheric circulation 850 hpa vector winds are associated with the moisture transportation from western tropical pacific to the subtropical region which determines the precipitation in china marengo et al 2001 illustrated circulation changes related to the onset and retreat of rainy season in amazonia by showing composite maps of the difference between the average of 4 pentads after onset retreat minus the 4 pentads before onset retreat 850 hpa vector winds reflecting atmospheric circulation and monsoon variability is used to explore the underlying causes of precipitation variability in this study composite maps of average 850 mb vector winds of 20 days after onset minus 20 days before onset in region 1 and 4 are shown in figs 6 and 7 respectively the day of onset is not included note that composite maps of 850 mb vector winds for the onset in region 1 3 are similar with region 4 similar to region 5 not shown region 1 and region 4 are selected to explain the correlation between circulation and the onset in different parts of china it can be seen from fig 6 that patterns for vector winds are similar before and after onset the onset of rainy season in regions 1 3 is associated with an increased cyclone in eastern china and anticyclone near the south china sea with an increase composite westerlies from the india ocean fig 6c the location of anomalous cyclonic flow for regions 4 5 is similar to regions 1 3 the difference between them lies in that the onset of rainy season in regions 4 5 is mainly controlled by increased cyclone in eastern china rather than the combined influence of anticyclone and cyclone fig 7c the effect of composite westerlies on regions 4 5 is also weaker as compared to regions 1 3 regions 1 5 displayed similar patterns regarding the relationship between retreat and monsoon not shown taking region 1 as the study area the retreat is influenced by cyclonic flow in the eastern regions of china and anticyclone near the south china sea as well however the retreat is associated with decreased anti cyclone and composite easterlies from the south china sea fig 8 figs 6 8 indicate that the indian ocean and the south china sea are the two principle elements for rainy season precipitation variability and the onset and retreat of rainy season are associated with anti cyclonic flow and monsoon wang et al 2002 found that the spring monsoon precipitation in the southern regions of china is highly related to cyclonic anomalous circulation in the north pacific which is consistent with our research atmospheric circulation and monsoon are leading drivers determining rainy season features which is equivalent to the results by dai and wigley 2000 feng et al 2011 wu et al 2003 and xiao et al 2015 previous research found that the beginning of rainy season is also resulted by tropospheric upward motion upper and low level jet stream and convergence of low level water vapor over china e g zhao et al 2006 and liu and ding 2008 therefore it is suggested that more elements should be considered in future research about the physical processes of the onset and retreat of rainy season 4 3 2 links between trends of onset retreat and sst table 1 presented various types of enso regimes such as conventional el niño cen and la niña cln enso modoki which is different from conventional enso was introduced by ashok et al 2007 enso modoki contains el niño modoki men and la niña modoki mln all these regimes play significant roles in the variability of chinese precipitation feng et al 2010 wan et al 2013 zhou and chan 2007 enso developing year represents when enso occurs and enso decaying year is the following year after enso happens it can be seen from table 1 that most mutation points of interannual rainy season features shown in fig 5 are associated with enso regimes yang and lau 2004 revealed that trends of chinese precipitation are associated with enso like modes of ssts which is in agreement with our research the analysis of sst and onset retreat within five regions is shown in figs 9 13 correlations between onset retreat and 3 month average moving values of sst in the preceding periods with lag ranging from 1 to 12 months are all investigated in this study correlations between preceding sst lagging 1 12 months and onset retreat are similar not shown which suggested that sst and rainy season features displayed stable relationship maps are shown below when lag correlation is strongest among 12 lagged periods the onset and retreat in region 1 all had negative correlation to pacific sst indicating that delayed onset and retreat is associated with cold sst fig 9 jja june july august sst in eastern and central equatorial pacific 10 n 20 s 170 w 100 w had largest influence on the onset in region 1 fig 9a the retreat is best correlated with southern pacific sst 7 months prior to it fig 9b largest correlation between sst and the onset in region 2 is aso sst 8 month earlier in eastern pacific 20 n 20 s 140 w 80 w with sst from october to december prior to retreat having strongest relation to retreat fig 10 the extent of sst showing strong correlation to the onset is much smaller in region 3 6 n 12 s 115 w 80 w in comparison to regions 1 and 2 fig 11a the retreat showed strong relationship to sst 2 months earlier over large areas of ocean centered on the equatorial pacific 150 w fig 11b region 4 had the weakest correlation to pacific sst within five regions fig 12 there is a positive correlation between the south pacific and the onset in region 4 and region 5 figs 12 and 13a indicating that delayed onset in region 4 5 is associated with warm sst in summary delayed onset is associated with cold sst in the pacific ocean except in region 4 5 where delayed onset is caused by warm sst advanced retreat in most parts of china may be attributed to warm pacific sst sst presenting strong correlation to rainy season characteristics in china is mainly concentrated on niño regions this study found rainy season variability is sensitive to enso related ssts at the interannual scale which is consistent with the research of huang and wu 1989 and dai and wigley 2000 still the obtained sst correlation may not be physically a cause without analyzing the atmospheric circulation changes that may provide a link as a consequence the further exploration of the influence of sst on rainy season in china and their underlying causes which can be explained by the atmospheric circulation is presented in the research of cao et al 2017 the research reveals that stronger monsoon and anti cyclone are associated with enhanced rainy season precipitation under the influence of enso the results also suggest a certain predictability of rainy season precipitation related to enso regimes through the analysis of the atmospheric circulation different performance of precipitation is associated with the atmospheric circulation and sst as shown in sections 4 3 1 and 4 3 2 previous studies have shown the underlying linkage between monsoon and sst black et al 2003 chang et al 2001 feng et al 2010 onyutha and willems 2015 zhang et al 2014 wu et al 2003 explained that the impacts of sst anomalies on precipitation is shown through the physical mechanism of links between sst and the atmospheric circulation feng et al 2011 pointed out that rainfall anomalies in china were mainly because of anomalous anti cyclone in the western north pacific related to sst variability gerlitz et al 2016 reported that the change of enso induced precipitation in tropical regions is directly associated with the atmospheric circulation however on interdecadal time scales precipitation patterns are influenced by not only the tropical pacific sst but also the subtropical northwestern pacific high besides ssts stratosphere troposphere interactions also play a significant role in rainfall changes in china yu et al 2004 as a result variability of rainy season features may not only be determined by sst but also by the combination of various drivers which ought to be studied further 5 conclusions the onset of rainy season in mainland china started from southeast in middle march to northwest in early june the occurrence of rainy season is associated with increased anticyclone in south china sea and cyclone in eastern china composite westerlies originate from the india ocean also plays a significant role on the onset of rainy season the retreat propagating from southeast late july to the central part of china mid october and shrank from the central region to the northwest the retreat of rainy season is considerably determined by composite easterlies and decreased cyclone and anticylcone delayed onset advanced retreat are observed in many parts of china at the interannual scale which is associated with cold warm sst in conventional enso regions enhanced rainy season precipitation is found in northwestern and southwestern china with other regions displaying stable precipitation hence it is easier to trigger flooding under such circumstances which should be paid enough attention this study improves our understanding regarding spatial and interannual variability of chinese rainy season and suggests that there may be certain predictability in chinese rainy season features related to atmospheric circulation and enso like modes of ssts author contributions

7479,precipitation plays an important role in both environment and human society and is a significant factor in many scientific researches such as water resources agriculture and climate impact studies the onset and retreat of rainy season are useful features to understand the variability of precipitation under the influence of climate change in this study the characteristics of onset and retreat in mainland china are investigated the multi scale moving t test was applied to determine rainy season and k means cluster analysis was used to divide china into sub regions to better investigate rainy season features the possible linkage of changing characteristics of onset and retreat to climate factors were also explored results show that 1 the onset started from middle march in the southeast of china to early june in the northwest and rainy season ended earliest in the northwest and southeast while the central china had the latest retreat 2 delayed onset and advanced retreat over time were observed in many parts of china together with overall stable or increased rainy season precipitation would likely lead to higher probability of flooding 3 the onset retreat was associated with the increased decreased number of cyclones in eastern china and anticyclone near the south china sea delayed onset and advanced retreat were likely related to cold and warm sea surface temperature sst in the conventional el niño southern oscillation enso regions respectively these results suggest that predictability of rainy season can be improved through the atmospheric circulation and sst and help water resources management and agricultural planning keywords rainy season onset retreat moving t test atmospheric circulation sst 1 introduction precipitation is one of the most important variable responding to climate change which has attracted urgent attention worldwide various aspects of precipitation have been investigated such as seasonality and extremes ashok et al 2009 feng et al 2011 ratnam et al 2011 su et al 2005 taschetto and england 2009 tedeschi et al 2013 wang et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 unfortunately characteristics of rainy season are less considered but are of vital significance to influence socio economy reliable prediction of the onset of rainy season will reduce the risk of improper planting sowing time and assist on time preparation of farmlands liebmann and marengo 2001 marteau et al 2011 omotosho et al 2000 a good knowledge of the retreat of rainy season is useful for the selection of crop varieties and has significant impact to ecosystem liebmann et al 2007 rainy season precipitation will also provide certain predictability for flood occurrence and be helpful to flood monitoring the variability of onset and retreat of rainy season and the total precipitation amount during rainy season are also direct indications for climate change and provide good scientific support to socio economic development and climate change research for a large region like china as a whole rainy season varies substantially in both space and time previous researches have been limited to the analysis of the total precipitation during rainy season and ignored the onset and retreat many works were focused on regional scales e g northwestern china the yangtze river basin and the coastal areas chen et al 2007 gemmer et al 2011 su et al 2005 wang et al 2013 zhang et al 2009 without the consideration of spatial heterogeneity which is an important factor for the continental scale hence the investigation of rainy season features variability such as the onset and retreat is necessary in china at the continental scale in order to gain insight of rainfall characteristics there has not been a consensus agreement regarding to the determination of rainy season due to irregularities in rainfall distribution in both space and time in literature the determination of rainy season can be based on rainfall data temperature deep convection monsoon or combination of several indices cook and heerdegen 2001 gan et al 2004 2005 goswami and xavier 2005 janowiak and xie 2003 liebmann et al 2007 qian and lee 2000 reason et al 2005 the majority of research used threshold values of a given index or indices to determine the onset and retreat which is somewhat subjective therefore a data originated objective method called the multi scale moving t test was used in this study to detect rainy season the onset and retreat defined by this method does not require an ad hoc threshold as in most traditional definitions there are also some other statistically based methods used to detect the rainy season such as the optimal segmentation method of ordered sample which can further divide the rainy season into several sub periods nonetheless this paper is just focused on the onset and retreat rather than the detailed types of rainy season therefore the multi scale moving t test is better for this research over others based on literature in order to understand the driving factors or the causes of the change in rainy season the correlations with monsoon and sea surface temperature sst are evaluated as they are the main factors influencing rainy season characteristics of china deng and wang 2002 ding and chan 2005 liu and ding 2008 lu 2005 wang and linho 2002 wang et al 2004 2002 yang and lau 2004 zhao et al 2010 from a meteorological perspective the onset and retreat reflect the changes in an atmospheric heat source whose addition or subtraction can alter large scale and regional circulation figueroa et al 1995 lenters and cook 1997 sst is important for developing and maintaining atmospheric circulations fan et al 2013 previous research have found that rainy season precipitation in china shows good relation to sst e g deng and wang 2002 as a consequence it is meaningful to investigate signals of rainy season characteristics through monsoon and lag period sst in this paper we will explore features of rainy season in mainland china at the continental scale the homogeneous regions will be determined based on rainy season characteristics including the onset retreat and rainy season precipitation the interannual variability of rainy season within individual homogeneous regions will be further investigated we will also explore the possible correlation of the onset and retreat with monsoon and sst to understand the signals of variability of the onset and retreat this study is of importance for helping us to provide a certain predictability to flooding occurrence and of great significance to understand hydrological cycle and water resource management under climate change in china the paper is organized as below the study area and data are described in section 2 followed by the methodology

the findings in section 5 2 study area and data china fig 1 located in middle latitude in the northern hemisphere has variable climate i g the monsoon climate the continental climate the mountain plateau climate china is prone to flood and drought occurrence in different regions and climate change is taken as one of the leading drivers for precipitation changes in the country daily

regions therefore we applied kriging interpolation method to induce a resolution of 0 2 0 2 ncep ncar reanalysis data https www esrl noaa gov psd data gridded data ncep reanalysis html were used to

includes the multi scale moving t test section 3 1 to determine the onsets and retreats of rainy season k means cluster analysis method section 3 2 to divide the mainland china into several obtain homogeneous sub regions according to rainy season features i e the onset retreat and precipitation trend analysis and pettitt test for abrupt point analysis section 3 3 of rainy season characteristics in individual sub regions and pearson coefficient correlations section 3 4 to explain the underlying relationship between rainy season characteristics and sst 3 1 determination of onset and retreat the multi scale moving t test method was applied to determine the onset and retreat by detecting the most significant change between two subsamples before and after the abruption point with equal sample sizes n where n is the length of the subsample n 30 31 182 or 183 here 182 or 183 corresponds to half the value of length of one year 365 or 366 theoretically the length of subsamples ranged from 1 to 182 183 nonetheless for the onset or retreat of rainy season it is not reasonable if the length of the subsample is just one day or several days when the mutation point is prominent hence the length of the subsample is limited from 30 to 182 183 the multi scale abruption points can be detected as fraedrich et al 1997 1 t n i x i 2 x i 1 n 1 2 s i 2 2 s i 1 2 1 2 where x i 1 and x i 2 defined as 2 x i 1 j i n i 1 x j n s i 1 2 j i n i 1 x j x i 1 2 n 1 3 x i 2 j i i n 1 x j n s i 2 2 j i i n 1 x j x i 2 2 n 1 and xi is daily precipitation for julian day i for one station within one year x i 1 and x i 2 are averaged values of subsamples before and after the julian day i respectively the t value was normalized by the 0 01 test value showing in eq 4 which is equivalent to the results of the mann kendall test at 0 05 significance level 4 t r n i t n i t 0 01 n where t r n i can be considered as the threshold to detect abruption points t r n i 1 0 is an increasing trend while t r n i 1 0 is a decreasing trend the onset of rainy season was defined as the abruption point corresponding to a maximum t r n i value where precipitation changes from a smaller to a larger value likewise the retreat is defined as the changing point corresponding to a minimum t r n i value taking daily precipitation data in one year at one station which is selected from region 1 classified in fig 4 as an example to present the determination of the onset and retreat fig 2 a the yellow greenish lines denote positive t r n i values and the blue lines denote negative values fig 2a reveals that the maximum value of t r n i is 1 35 when the corresponding julian day is 106 and the corresponding timescale is 96 it means that the onset date of rainy season is julian day 106 which shows the most conspicuous abruption in the timescale of 96 days similarly the retreat date of rainy season is julian day 260 3 2 k means cluster analysis for regionalization it is necessary to divide china into sub regions to explore rainy season features due to the heterogeneity of chinese rainy season characteristics previous studies have used administration or climatic zones as the criteria to determine homogeneous sub regions however they are not statistically sound because they do not directly reflect rainy season characteristics from observations in this study the k means clustering with factors of the onset retreat of rainy season and total precipitation during rainy season is used to determine the homogeneous sub regions due to high efficiency in dealing with large amount of data k means cluster algorithm aims to find a partition so that the squared error between empirical mean of a cluster and points in the cluster is minimized the squared error is defined as jain 2010 5 j c k x i c k x i μ k 2 where x i are parameters i e mean onset retreat and rainy season precipitation for the period of 1960 2015 in i th station x x i i 1 n is clustered into a set of k clusters μ k is the mean value of cluster c k j c k the squared error of cluster c k where c c k k 1 k the objective of k means cluster analysis is to minimize the sum of squared error in all k clusters 6 j c k 1 k x i c k x i μ k 2 in this study k is equal to 5 considering the number of administration and climate zones in china 3 3 pettitt test for change point analysis within the homogeneous sub regions the features of rainy season i e the onset retreat and total precipitation evaluated over time pettit test was applied to detect a single change point in interannual onset retreat precipitation series in order to evaluate the influence of climate change on rainy season more than one change points can be detected if other methods such as the mann kendall test are used the reason why choosing the pettitt test is that we want to detect the most prominent change point pettitt test was used to detect a single abruption point in interannual onset retreat precipitation series xi i 1 2 56 where xi represents the mean onset retreat precipitation of stations in one sub region and for i th year the non parametric statistic is defined as follows pettitt 1979 7 k t max u t t where 8 u t t i 1 t j t 1 t sgn x i x j kt can be considered as the abruption point of series and the result is meaningful when kt 0 5 the parameter p is applied to judge the significant level of the abruption point which is defined as 9 p 2 exp 6 k t 2 n 3 n 2 and n 56 in this study when p is 0 05 it means that the change point is significant at the significance level of 0 05 3 4 correlation evaluation between onset retreat and sst the pearson liner correlation coefficients between rainy season characteristics and sst were evaluated the pearson liner correlation coefficient r can be calculated as pearson 1895 10

1959 2014 4 results and discussion 4 1 regionalization of mainland china the average onset dates of rainy season during 1960 2015 in china varied from julian day 75 155 fig 3 a the onset progressed northwestwards from mid march in coastal regions in the southeast to the beginning of june in the northwest the central and northeastern regions of china had median onset ranging from mid april to mid may different methods to define summer monsoon onset dates related to the rainy season have been presented in previous studies for example wang and linho 2002 designed a compound rainfall variable which can synthesize three characteristics i e the total amount of summer rainfall the annual range of rainfall and the seasonal distribution of rainfall to determine the onset of rainy season their results show that the asian monsoon rainy season begins over the south china sea and then advances northwestwards which is in accordance with our research rainy season ended earliest in the southeast as well fig 3b with the retreat occurring in late july overall the retreat progressed from the coastal areas to central china 100 e 110 e 20 n 35 n and shrank from the central regions to the northwest with rainy season ending in september and october in central china and late july and august in the northwest the distribution of precipitation is similar to the onset fig 3c with rainy season precipitation shrinking from southeast 1500 1800 mm to northwest 2 300 mm in summary rainy season started and ended earliest in coastal regions and had largest amount of rainy season precipitation central china had median values of onset and precipitation with latest retreat northwestern china had smallest precipitation and latest onset dates the spatial pattern of rainy season characteristics are generally consistent with the research of deng and wang 2002 who argued that rainfall in china mainly occurs in may to july may september in the southeastern and southern regions it can be seen that the features of rainy season in china vary in space the regionalization of mainland china therefore is necessary in order to describe interannual rainy season characteristics in different regions k means clustering method was applied to divide china into sub regions that have coherent onset retreat and precipitation features this classification is based on mean values of multi year onset retreat of the rainy season and precipitation during the rainy season each station has three parameters i e mean onset retreat and rainy season precipitation for the period of 1960 2015 which are used to cluster similar stations geographic homogeneity of these stations were also considered in division mainland china is divided into five regions fig 4 region 1 contains mainly the northwestern china and region 2 includes northeastern china the yellow river basin and northern parts of huaihe river basin region 3 contains southern regions of the huaihe river basin and the northern part of the yangtze river basin region 4 includes southern regions of the yangtze river basin and region 5 includes southeastern china the regionalization in fig 4 is in accordance with the changing pattern of east asian summer monsoon easm given in ding and chan 2005 zhao et al 2016 also showed that easm makes a great contribution to the atmospheric moisture and precipitation in china notably the easm exhibits some patterns of the onset and retreat moreover rainy season in the mainland china also closely relates to easm which will be further presented in section 4 3 4 2 interannual variability the interannual variability of rainy season is provided in fig 5 which displays the time series of average onset retreat and rainy season precipitation within the five homogeneous regions from 1960 to 2015 the mean values are determined for each observation station and then averaged for all stations within each region pettitt test was applied to detect the abruption point of rainy season characteristics in each region in terms of the onset fig 5 there is no evidence of a long term tendency and no abruption point in regions 1 for the period of 1960 2015 with the average values of onset julian day 132 in recent two decades however region 1 displayed obvious delayed trend region 2 had a significant mutation point in year 1997 at the level of 0 1 region 3 had an earlier abruption year 1979 in comparison with region 2 before which the onset had a stable level in april the onset had an advanced trend for the period of 1979 2002 followed by a delayed tendency for 2002 2015 region 4 displayed similarity to region 2 with respect to the occurrence time of mutation year 1996 in region 4 and the variation of onset stabilizing before mutation the onset in region 4 had an overall delayed trend for the period of 1960 2015 there is no obvious tendency and no abruption point in regions 5 with the average values of onset julian day 107 the retreat had an abruption point year 1983 in region 1 which is statistically significant at the significance level of 5 the retreat dates advanced approximately a month for 1984 2015 as compared to 1960 1983 shi et al 2006 found that the climate change in northwest china is most notably in the year 1987 which is consistent with mutation points detected in this study year 1983 for retreat and year 1991 for precipitation it can be seen that the trends of rainy season features in china may be attributed to climate change region 2 had the largest variation around the mutation point year 1976 the fluctuation is gradually shrinking and has a tendency to stabilize at the level of late september after 1976 similarly the retreat fluctuated largely in region 3 before 2001 followed by decreasing scale of variation regions 4 and 5 had no abruption point and no obvious trend of advance or delay precipitation in region 1 displayed the most distinctive abruption at the year of 1991 and is significant at the level of 1 after 1991 there is an obvious precipitation increase with mean values changing from 80 mm to 98 mm per day wang et al 2013 pointed out that daily average precipitation in northwestern china from 1960 to 2009 showed increasing trend which is consistent with our research regions 2 4 had no mutation over 1960 2015 and displayed no apparent tendency rainy season precipitation in region 5 increased apparently after 1992 with average value of 1390 mm per day but the trend of precipitation is decreased ding et al 2008 and wu et al 2010 revealed that the southern part of china have undergone much more significant rainfall events and 1992 is detected as the climate changing point in the southern china which is in accordance with our research nitta and hu 1996 and qian and qin 2008 also investigated the precipitation division and climate shift in china as well their results are different from our research because of the different periods we choose such as the period of 1960 2000 was chosen in the research of qian and qin 2008 and the different division methods in summary many parts of china displayed delayed onset and advanced retreat at the interannual scale especially in recent twenty years only coastal regions and northwestern china presented increased rainy season precipitation with most parts of china had stable precipitation amount flooding is more easily trigged under such circumstances which should be paid enough attention 4 3 relationship between rainy season characteristics and atmospheric circulation and sst 4 3 1 links between the onset and retreat of rainy season and atmospheric circulation 850 hpa vector winds are associated with the moisture transportation from western tropical pacific to the subtropical region which determines the precipitation in china marengo et al 2001 illustrated circulation changes related to the onset and retreat of rainy season in amazonia by showing composite maps of the difference between the average of 4 pentads after onset retreat minus the 4 pentads before onset retreat 850 hpa vector winds reflecting atmospheric circulation and monsoon variability is used to explore the underlying causes of precipitation variability in this study composite maps of average 850 mb vector winds of 20 days after onset minus 20 days before onset in region 1 and 4 are shown in figs 6 and 7 respectively the day of onset is not included note that composite maps of 850 mb vector winds for the onset in region 1 3 are similar with region 4 similar to region 5 not shown region 1 and region 4 are selected to explain the correlation between circulation and the onset in different parts of china it can be seen from fig 6 that patterns for vector winds are similar before and after onset the onset of rainy season in regions 1 3 is associated with an increased cyclone in eastern china and anticyclone near the south china sea with an increase composite westerlies from the india ocean fig 6c the location of anomalous cyclonic flow for regions 4 5 is similar to regions 1 3 the difference between them lies in that the onset of rainy season in regions 4 5 is mainly controlled by increased cyclone in eastern china rather than the combined influence of anticyclone and cyclone fig 7c the effect of composite westerlies on regions 4 5 is also weaker as compared to regions 1 3 regions 1 5 displayed similar patterns regarding the relationship between retreat and monsoon not shown taking region 1 as the study area the retreat is influenced by cyclonic flow in the eastern regions of china and anticyclone near the south china sea as well however the retreat is associated with decreased anti cyclone and composite easterlies from the south china sea fig 8 figs 6 8 indicate that the indian ocean and the south china sea are the two principle elements for rainy season precipitation variability and the onset and retreat of rainy season are associated with anti cyclonic flow and monsoon wang et al 2002 found that the spring monsoon precipitation in the southern regions of china is highly related to cyclonic anomalous circulation in the north pacific which is consistent with our research atmospheric circulation and monsoon are leading drivers determining rainy season features which is equivalent to the results by dai and wigley 2000 feng et al 2011 wu et al 2003 and xiao et al 2015 previous research found that the beginning of rainy season is also resulted by tropospheric upward motion upper and low level jet stream and convergence of low level water vapor over china e g zhao et al 2006 and liu and ding 2008 therefore it is suggested that more elements should be considered in future research about the physical processes of the onset and retreat of rainy season 4 3 2 links between trends of onset retreat and sst table 1 presented various types of enso regimes such as conventional el niño cen and la niña cln enso modoki which is different from conventional enso was introduced by ashok et al 2007 enso modoki contains el niño modoki men and la niña modoki mln all these regimes play significant roles in the variability of chinese precipitation feng et al 2010 wan et al 2013 zhou and chan 2007 enso developing year represents when enso occurs and enso decaying year is the following year after enso happens it can be seen from table 1 that most mutation points of interannual rainy season features shown in fig 5 are associated with enso regimes yang and lau 2004 revealed that trends of chinese precipitation are associated with enso like modes of ssts which is in agreement with our research the analysis of sst and onset retreat within five regions is shown in figs 9 13 correlations between onset retreat and 3 month average moving values of sst in the preceding periods with lag ranging from 1 to 12 months are all investigated in this study correlations between preceding sst lagging 1 12 months and onset retreat are similar not shown which suggested that sst and rainy season features displayed stable relationship maps are shown below when lag correlation is strongest among 12 lagged periods the onset and retreat in region 1 all had negative correlation to pacific sst indicating that delayed onset and retreat is associated with cold sst fig 9 jja june july august sst in eastern and central equatorial pacific 10 n 20 s 170 w 100 w had largest influence on the onset in region 1 fig 9a the retreat is best correlated with southern pacific sst 7 months prior to it fig 9b largest correlation between sst and the onset in region 2 is aso sst 8 month earlier in eastern pacific 20 n 20 s 140 w 80 w with sst from october to december prior to retreat having strongest relation to retreat fig 10 the extent of sst showing strong correlation to the onset is much smaller in region 3 6 n 12 s 115 w 80 w in comparison to regions 1 and 2 fig 11a the retreat showed strong relationship to sst 2 months earlier over large areas of ocean centered on the equatorial pacific 150 w fig 11b region 4 had the weakest correlation to pacific sst within five regions fig 12 there is a positive correlation between the south pacific and the onset in region 4 and region 5 figs 12 and 13a indicating that delayed onset in region 4 5 is associated with warm sst in summary delayed onset is associated with cold sst in the pacific ocean except in region 4 5 where delayed onset is caused by warm sst advanced retreat in most parts of china may be attributed to warm pacific sst sst presenting strong correlation to rainy season characteristics in china is mainly concentrated on niño regions this study found rainy season variability is sensitive to enso related ssts at the interannual scale which is consistent with the research of huang and wu 1989 and dai and wigley 2000 still the obtained sst correlation may not be physically a cause without analyzing the atmospheric circulation changes that may provide a link as a consequence the further exploration of the influence of sst on rainy season in china and their underlying causes which can be explained by the atmospheric circulation is presented in the research of cao et al 2017 the research reveals that stronger monsoon and anti cyclone are associated with enhanced rainy season precipitation under the influence of enso the results also suggest a certain predictability of rainy season precipitation related to enso regimes through the analysis of the atmospheric circulation different performance of precipitation is associated with the atmospheric circulation and sst as shown in sections 4 3 1 and 4 3 2 previous studies have shown the underlying linkage between monsoon and sst black et al 2003 chang et al 2001 feng et al 2010 onyutha and willems 2015 zhang et al 2014 wu et al 2003 explained that the impacts of sst anomalies on precipitation is shown through the physical mechanism of links between sst and the atmospheric circulation feng et al 2011 pointed out that rainfall anomalies in china were mainly because of anomalous anti cyclone in the western north pacific related to sst variability gerlitz et al 2016 reported that the change of enso induced precipitation in tropical regions is directly associated with the atmospheric circulation however on interdecadal time scales precipitation patterns are influenced by not only the tropical pacific sst but also the subtropical northwestern pacific high besides ssts stratosphere troposphere interactions also play a significant role in rainfall changes in china yu et al 2004 as a result variability of rainy season features may not only be determined by sst but also by the combination of various drivers which ought to be studied further 5 conclusions the onset of rainy season in mainland china started from southeast in middle march to northwest in early june the occurrence of rainy season is associated with increased anticyclone in south china sea and cyclone in eastern china composite westerlies originate from the india ocean also plays a significant role on the onset of rainy season the retreat propagating from southeast late july to the central part of china mid october and shrank from the central region to the northwest the retreat of rainy season is considerably determined by composite easterlies and decreased cyclone and anticylcone delayed onset advanced retreat are observed in many parts of china at the interannual scale which is associated with cold warm sst in conventional enso regions enhanced rainy season precipitation is found in northwestern and southwestern china with other regions displaying stable precipitation hence it is easier to trigger flooding under such circumstances which should be paid enough attention this study improves our understanding regarding spatial and interannual variability of chinese rainy season and suggests that there may be certain predictability in chinese rainy season features related to atmospheric circulation and enso like modes of ssts author contributions
