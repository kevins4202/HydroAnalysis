7870,study region central asia study focus the possible future changes in meteorological hydrological and agricultural drought in central asia are analyzed based on the multi model projections from phase 6 of the coupled model intercomparison project cmip6 the changes in hydroclimate variables and drought events are examined to reveal the responses to different emissions pathway by comparing the historical period 1995 2014 and future period 2081 2100 new hydrological insights for the region corresponding to the spatially consistent warming in central asia an asymmetrical west east orientated dipole precipitation pattern i e a decrease in the west but an increase in the east is found in the warm season april to september precipitation of future projections a similar but even stronger west east or northwest southeast contrast is found in the changes in total runoff and surface soil moisture in response to future warming most of central asia shows an increase in drought frequency and duration by the end of the current century mainly caused by the consistently enhanced evaporation that roughly balances the precipitation growth after 2030 when the effect of temperature is considered the drought area of central asia displays a significant upward trend under both the moderate and high emissions pathway however in the east of the region including northwest china and western mongolia warming and wetting tendencies under the future warming climate are apparent regardless of the drought definition graphical abstract ga1 keywords drought hydroclimatology future projection precipitation central asia cmip6 1 introduction drought which is mainly induced by precipitation deficiency is one of the most concerning types of climatological disaster and natural hazard mckee et al 1993 central asia including the countries of kazakhstan uzbekistan turkmenistan kyrgyzstan and tajikistan as well as the western part of northwest china fig 1a is one of the most arid regions in the world moreover the region is sensitive and vulnerable to rapid climate change due to its scarcity of water resources and complex terrain giorgi 2006 lioubimtseva and henebry 2009 tucker et al 2015 de beurs et al 2018 in recent decades central asia has experienced a significant increase in temperature but an unobvious decrease in precipitation lioubimtseva 2015 de beurs et al 2018 the assessment and projection of water resources and drought could therefore provide valuable information for improving adaptive strategies for central asia in general drought can be classified into four categories meteorological drought agricultural or soil moisture drought hydrological drought and socioeconomic drought van loon et al 2015 precipitation deficiency is the main factor considered for meteorological drought as a typical continental climate zone most parts of central asia are vulnerable to drought owing to the scarcity of precipitation although central asia has shown a weak overall drying trend in recent decades the occurrence of drought in the region is characterized by significant spatiotemporal variations li et al 2017 guo et al 2018 zhong et al 2021 including wetting trends in the eastern part of central asia but obvious drying trends in most western areas considering the regional declines in precipitation and enhanced evaporation induced by increasing greenhouse gas concentrations it is expected that the frequency and severity of drought will increase in the warming world of the future dai et al 2004 sheffield and wood 2008 dai 2011a 2011b 2013 cook et al 2014 huang et al 2016 central asia has experienced complex changes in precipitation and temperature under the climate changes related to greenhouse gas emissions hydrological variations and land use cover changes lioubimtseva 2015 de beurs et al 2018 similar to other typical arid and semi arid areas chen et al 2009 ji et al 2014 huang et al 2017 central asia has a higher mean warming rate than the global terrestrial mean moreover the warming rate of central asia was higher in the first decade of the 21st century but relatively lower beforehand hu et al 2014 in terms of seasonal variability precipitation in central asia shows strong spatial heterogeneity characterized by the peak rainfall amount occurring in spring and winter over southwestern central asia but in summer over northern and southeastern parts shi et al 2007 lioubimtseva and henebry 2009 wei et al 2010 klein et al 2012 lioubimtseva 2015 song bai 2016 zhong et al 2022 comparably the variation in precipitation in central asia is more complex and uncertain than that in temperature hu et al 2016 under the significant warming trend the regional annual mean precipitation of central asia displays a weak decreasing trend simultaneously with increasing variability superimposed on the long term trend in recent decades yin et al 2016 li et al 2017 which is caused by the divergent responses of precipitation over different areas of central asia to global warming li et al 2017 zhong et al 2021 in addition the responses of drought to warming also rely on the characteristics of the analyzed area seasons and different drought related variables as a key factor that determines surface hydrological and agro ecological drought soil moisture is a good indicator of the wetness and dryness of the climate the variation in soil moisture can reflect the background climate change including the variation in air temperature precipitation solar radiation and so on in central asia the average soil moisture is low particularly in kazakhstan turkmenistan and northwest china li et al 2015 z li et al 2015 moreover the spatial mean soil moisture in central asia has displayed a declining trend over the past several decades li et al 2017 however the soil moisture trend in central asia also shows a heterogeneous distribution consisting of decreasing trends in the five central asian countries owing to significantly increased temperatures but a gradual increasing trend in northwest china because of enhanced moisture transport li et al 2015 zhong et al 2022 aside from precipitation temperature and soil moisture runoff can also influence the regional dryness and wetness and lead to hydrological drought runoff changes in a complex way influenced by both natural variability and human activity especially in arid and semi arid regions in drought periods the reduced precipitation lower inflow and the diversion of inflow for irrigation have resulted in the shrinking of the aral sea micklin 2016 the variation in runoff recharge in central asia is jointly impacted by the natural variability related to precipitation and the melting of glaciers sorg et al 2012 gan et al 2015 over the past few decades most river runoff in central asia has displayed an increasing trend li et al 2017 model projections suggest that the runoff from melting glaciers will not change much in the near future but reduced precipitation snowmelt and intensified evapotranspiration will ultimately lead to decreased runoff in central asia gan et al 2015 future climate projections from phases 3 and 5 of the coupled model intercomparison project cmip3 and cmip5 meehl et al 2007 meehl and bony 2012 have been widely used to investigate the projected mean or changes in extreme temperature precipitation and other variables under different 21st century emission scenarios e g thibeault et al 2010 yang et al 2011 toreti et al 2013 ukkola et al 2018 wan et al 2018 cmip5 projections suggest central asia will become warmer in the coming decades accompanied by inconsistent changes in precipitation in a dipole pattern with drying in the southwest but wetting in the northeast reyer et al 2017 which is divergent from the projected increase in precipitation in dryland areas globally zhao et al 2014 in addition greater runoff is projected due to the increasingly rapid melting of glaciers and snow as well as the transition from snow to rain in the near term future but decreasing water availability in the medium to long term reyer et al 2017 cook et al 2020 recently the outputs of the state of the art models involved in phase 6 of the coupled model intercomparison project cmip6 eyring et al 2016 whose aim it was to overcome the drawbacks of their cmip5 counterparts rivera and arnould 2020 have begun to be released cmip6 projections indicate that the increases in soil moisture in central asia will be partially offset by an increasing contribution from evaporation zhao and dai 2022 therefore against the background of future warming potential evapotranspiration has an increasing tendency and thus exerts a drying effect on soils reyer et al 2017 clearly there are still some important issues related to future climate change that need to be clarified for central asia the responses of drought in the region to future climate changes particularly the spatial distributions of variations and uncertainties against different backgrounds of climate change are still unclear and deserving of further exploration focusing on the hydroclimatic changes in the 21st century this work seeks to uncover the patterns of change in the main variables related to the dry and wet states in central asia under different climate scenarios from the future climate projections of cmip6 to the best of our knowledge the possible future changes in drought and the regional hydroclimate have not yet been comprehensively investigated for central asia on the basis of cmip6 outputs yet such work is critical for revealing the future variations in drought related variables toward a better understanding of the changes in regional dryness and wetness against the background of climate change in our most state of the art models multiple indicators of drought have been used to reflect regional dryness and wetness in central asia from different physical perspectives e g bothe et al 2012 huang et al 2017 li et al 2017 guo et al 2018 in this study precipitation soil moisture and runoff are used to reflect the water cycle in the definitions of meteorological drought agricultural drought and hydrological drought respectively variations in soil moisture and runoff mainly reflect the change in water content at the terrestrial interface in which soil moisture is a particularly valuable measure to reflect local and regional dryness and wetness li et al 2017 compared with precipitation soil moisture and runoff are more directly connected with temperature and thus feature more robust and widespread drying with global warming because of the enhanced moisture demand of evapotranspiration dai et al 2018 mankin et al 2019 in this paper we focus on discussing the spatiotemporal changes in precipitation surface soil moisture and runoff in order to examine the model simulated hydroclimatic changes additionally considering the skill levels of global climate models in projecting soil moisture and runoff are lower than they are for precipitation zhao and dai 2015 ukkola et al 2018 this study uses precipitation and aridity index to identify drought events in which the latter considers potential evapotranspiration 2 materials and methods 2 1 data and analysis method in this work the historical and future projections of cmip6 models are applied to explore the changes in dryness and wetness in central asia compared to cmip5 the latest climate models in cmip6 are driven by different emission and land use scenarios namely the shared socioeconomic pathways ssps o neill et al 2016 these scenarios provide new opportunities to investigate the possible changes in precipitation evaporation soil moisture runoff and aridity conditions over central asia under different development and radiative forcing scenarios under the cmip6 framework natural and anthropogenic climate forcing are simulated in the historical period from 1850 to 2014 and in the future projections from 2015 to 2100 in total 22 coupled global climate models are selected from cmip6 table 1 for the present study with one run per model forced by two emission scenarios i e the medium forcing pathway ssp2 4 5 and the high end forcing fossil fueled development pathway ssp5 8 5 these two future projections together with the historical simulations are separately applied to extract the future and historical characteristics of hydroclimate variables in central asia the differences in these variables between the historical period 1995 2014 and future period 2081 2100 are ultimately used to represent the possible spatial and temporal variability of the drought pattern under different emission scenarios the change in precipitation only reflects the variation in dryness and wetness from the perspective of meteorological drought here to additionally reflect the perspectives of hydrological and agricultural drought we also explore the responses of soil moisture and runoff respectively through synthesizing future estimates of hydrological variables in central asia we can obtain the possible tendencies of drought from different perspectives from the above cmip6 models table 1 the monthly projections of near surface air temperature precipitation evapotranspiration surface soil moisture and total runoff flux are extracted all selected variables are regridded onto a 2 5 2 5 horizontal grid for the regridded output of each model the potential evapotranspiration is calculated by using the penman monteith parameterization as in the work of zhao and dai 2022 the anomaly fields of the variables discussed in this study are calculated relative to the historical climatology of 1995 2014 considering the hydroclimatic changes in response to global warming possess strong seasonality composite analysis is conducted for both the warm season april to september and cold season october to next march the multi model ensemble mean is derived by averaging all the regridded model data 2 2 drought events definitions and classification of aridity in addition to precipitation soil moisture and runoff it is necessary to show more physical aspects of drought events in the warming environment through considering the scarcity of water supply caused by the increasing atmospheric demand of water vapor potential evapotranspiration which depends heavily on the variation in temperature reyer et al 2017 should be given more consideration when studying drought in a warmer world accordingly in the present work the influence of potential evapotranspiration is considered in the definitions of drought by introducing the aridity index ai greve et al 2014 huang et al 2017 which is defined by the precipitation to potential evapotranspiration ratio this index is characterized by the long term balance between water supply from the atmosphere and the atmospheric demand for moisture and has been widely applied to measure changes in aridity e g feng and fu 2013 greve et al 2014 ukkola et al 2018 similar to the work of zhao and dai 2015 we define drought events by the monthly drought variables being lower than the 10th percentile of the historical 1995 2014 climate in each grid cell for each model since our focus is on the effects of precipitation and warming on changes in drought events variables including precipitation and ai are used to define drought events for each model selected in this study table 1 a 3 month running smoother is applied to the monthly precipitation and ai data in the ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios to filter out short term variations before the drought event detection process is carried out this study mainly focuses on the annual drought frequency duration and area which are the most critical and fundamental properties of drought andreadis et al 2005 the annual drought frequency is defined as the number of drought events in each grid cell during each calendar year in order to avoid the difficulty in defining drought events covering multiple years the month with the lowest precipitation or ai in the life cycle is considered as the occurrence time of that drought event drought duration is defined by the total number of consecutive months the drought lasts and drought area is represented by the percentage of the drought s extent with respect to the total area of central asia all the above metrics of drought events are averaged over the models selected from cmip6 to obtain their multi model ensemble mean in addition the annual mean ai is used to demonstrate the historical and future patterns of drought based on the ai in each grid cell the aridity conditions of central asia are classified into three zones hulme 1996 huang et al 2017 ukkola et al 2018 dry ai 0 65 transitional 0 65 ai 1 and wet ai 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 projected changes in hydroclimate variables under the warming climate 3 1 1 temperature broadly central asia can be separated into two parts fig 1a the west and the east divided by the wet and high altitude mountains between baldwin and vecchi 2016 in the eastern part the kunlun and tianshan mountains surrounds the tarim basin with extreme aridity the western part is characterized by flat terrain with several lakes including the caspian and aral seas and lake balkash located from west to east from the temperature variations of central asia shown in fig 1b under both the medium ssp2 4 5 and high end ssp5 8 5 emission scenarios accelerated warming exists in the region from roughly around the 1980 s obvious overlap exists between the two scenarios before about 2035 in terms of their warming periods fig 1b thereafter however a slower warming rate is gradually displayed in the more aggressive mitigation scenario of ssp2 4 5 relative to the historical temperature during 1995 2014 the ensemble mean warming reaches about 3 1 k for ssp2 4 5 and 6 1 k for ssp5 8 5 by the last 20 years of the 21st century furthermore the spatial distributions of temperature projections reveal quasi consistent warming in central asia under both the ssp2 4 5 fig 1c and ssp5 8 5 fig 1d scenario based on the 22 cmip6 models selected generally speaking based on cmip6 projections the warming rate of central asia is higher than the global mean in which relatively stronger warming tends to occur in kazakhstan northwest china and the mountainous area fig 1c d the features of the warming patterns shown in their annual means fig 1c d are found in both the warm and cold seasons but the maximal warming rate occurs in summer under both scenarios figure omitted moreover a similar warming distribution to those shown in fig 1c and d is also projected by cmip5 models dong et al 2018 suggesting the responses of central asia to future warming are robust over most mid latitude areas of the northern hemisphere the warming of hot extremes is happening faster than that of the mean temperature vogel et al 2017 consequently drought and other land atmosphere feedbacks induced by hot extremes are usually found to be more intense than those induced by mean warming donat et al 2018 in this study the local 90th percentile of temperature t 90 in each grid cell is used as the threshold to define extreme temperature for the historical 1995 2014 and future 2081 2100 projections the local mean air temperature t mean is also computed in each grid cell furthermore the long term changes of t 90 and t mean between the historical and future periods i e t 90 and t mean are combined as the ratio t 90 t mean to examine the relative change in extreme heat with respect to the background mean warming fig 2 displays the spatial distributions of the responses of t 90 t mean to global warming under the two ssps considered the projected temperature extremes tend to reinforce in a wide quasi zonal band from the southwest to the northeast of central asia the highest ratio of t 90 t mean can reach about 1 2 1 3 over the southwest corner of central asia under ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 respectively in eastern central asia northwestern china and western mongolia a similar amplification of high temperature extremes is experienced particularly under the ssp2 4 5 scenario fig 2a compared with the medium emissions pathway i e ssp2 4 5 which has roughly equivalent effects in the southwest and east of central asia fig 2a the high end emissions pathway i e ssp5 8 5 tends to reinforce the temperature extremes in the southwest fig 2b 3 1 2 precipitation and evapotranspiration regionally precipitation soil moisture runoff and evapotranspiration have been markedly affected by global warming characterized by responses that are far more complicated than those of temperature zhao and dai 2015 projected the annual precipitation over most of eurasia to increase by about 10 30 during the last three decades of the current century under the rcp4 5 scenario compared to the historical record ma et al 2021 suggested that precipitation and actual evapotranspiration will increase in the future under global warming similar results can also be found in fig 3a and d of the present study which demonstrate the comparable and robust increasing trends in the regional means of annual precipitation and evapotranspiration since the 1980 s under both ssps comparing the projections based on ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 that of the milder pathway i e ssp2 4 5 features decelerated increases in both variables during the last three decades of the current century in contrast under the ssp5 8 5 scenario the two variables display continuous increases throughout the whole of the 21st century on average the annual precipitation of central asia increases by about 15 from 1995 2014 to 2081 2100 under ssp5 8 5 fig 3d a similar but lower magnitude increase is found under the ssp2 4 5 scenario the net effect of precipitation and evapotranspiration is largely responsible for determining the basic state of regional dryness and wetness the increase in annual mean evapotranspiration offsets most of the increase in precipitation as the land surface temperature rises zhao and dai 2015 which leads to less surface soil moisture and runoff flux however the role of evapotranspiration overwhelms that of precipitation in the warm season fig 3b e and vice versa in the cold season fig 3c f in the cold season the input of water from precipitation is generally larger than the loss of water through evapotranspiration which leads to the increasing trend of cold season runoff fig 3c f it is worth noting that the increase in future precipitation is mainly induced by increases in heavy precipitation but not the rainfall frequency sun et al 2007 although uncertainties exist in models cmip6 models perform better than cmip5 models in their simulation of extreme precipitation over asia dong and dong 2021 from the spatial distribution shown in fig 4a the largest increase in precipitation reaches 20 30 in southeastern central asia mainly concentrated in northwest china in the warm season fig 4e the spatial heterogeneity of precipitation becomes significant characterized by a zonal dipole like anomaly with a decrease in the west but an increase in the east considering the inconsistent seasonal responses in western central asia in different seasons fig 4e i the precipitation of eastern central asia features weak seasonality although the strongest increase occurs in the cold season fig 4i it should be noted that the precipitation simulated by most cmip6 models is close to that of observations over western central asia although wet biases exist in northwest china dong and dong 2021 guo et al 2021 the rising temperature results in accelerated soil water consumption as well as an increase in evapotranspiration this is one of the major drivers of agricultural and hydrological droughts as mentioned above and shown in table 2 there is better coherence between the regionally averaged precipitation and evapotranspiration for the whole year with those of the warm season than there is with those of the cold season jiang et al 2020 the evapotranspiration in the cold season fig 4j increases remarkably over northwestern central asia and with greater dependence on the changes in temperature fig 1d than precipitation fig 4i 3 1 3 surface soil moisture the soil moisture in the surface layer is influenced the most by climate change as compared with other layers li et al 2015 as can be seen in fig 3 the annual surface soil moisture shows a weak decreasing trend under both the ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenario the standard deviation among models is also shown in fig 3 indicating consistent decreasing trends of soil moisture across most models this is largely caused by the increase in precipitation being insufficient to counteract the increase in evapotranspiration in particular the projection under ssp5 8 5 shows more distinct declining trends in annual surface soil moisture than that under ssp2 4 5 after about 2050 highlighting the role of the enhanced evaporative demand of the atmosphere and vegetation as warming intensifies therefore the continuous increase in evaporation tends to accelerate the consumption of soil moisture and thus amplify the risk of regional drought in central asia in the future this coincides closely with the frequency of soil moisture based drought events in central asia in cmip5 projections zhao and dai 2015 in terms of seasonality it is natural to expect the surface soil moisture to decline in the warm season because of the enhanced evaporative demand especially under ssp5 8 5 in this respect under both ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 partial correlation analysis table 2 indicates that the change in surface soil moisture is determined more by changes in evaporation in the warm season whereas it is controlled more by precipitation in the cold season therefore the concurrent increasing trends of surface air temperature and evaporation along with the decreasing trend of surface soil moisture may trigger and amplify the risk of agricultural drought in a warmer climate especially in the warm season in terms of spatial distribution ssp5 8 5 projections show more heterogenous changes in surface soil moisture than those in precipitation all year round fig 4c g k except for the wetting response seen in the southeast of the region all of central asia shows a strong decrease in annual mean surface soil moisture fig 4c as shown in fig 4g and k soil moisture deficits are more widespread in the warm season than the cold season coinciding with the contracting wetting area in southeast central asia from the annual and seasonal responses of precipitation and surface soil moisture shown in fig 4 we can conclude that the more severe development pathway i e ssp5 8 5 is likely to cause more extensive agricultural drought than meteorological drought in central asia 3 1 4 total runoff flux the partial correlation analysis results presented in table 2 also reveal that the changes in total runoff correlate significantly with those in precipitation in annual and seasonal mean terms additionally the cold season evapotranspiration and warm season surface soil moisture also correlate closely with the runoff variations in general the trends of total runoff are mainly determined by the relative strength between precipitation and evapotranspiration the total runoff shows decreasing increasing trends in the warm cold season fig 3b c e and f because the increases in evapotranspiration offset a large portion of the precipitation induced increases in runoff in the warm season over central asia zhao and dai 2015 similar results have also been reported on the basis of cmip5 model projections gan et al 2015 it should also be noted that snowmelt glacial melt and baseflow are also important for the runoff in central asia under a warming climate according to gan et al 2015 the determining factor for snowmelt in the future will be precipitation whereas glacier melt will mainly be driven by future changes in temperature during the cold season the increase in total runoff is partly attributable to the expectation that precipitation will fall more as rain rather than snow against a background of warming cook et al 2020 at the same time the increased precipitation can in turn enhance snowmelt in winter and early spring and further reinforce the runoff fig 3c f fig 4d h and l show that the increases in annual total runoff flux are concentrated in the mountainous areas and northwest china whereas the decreases are mainly in the area of the caspian sea and central and western areas of kazakhstan fig 4d in general the runoff in high northern latitudes and mid latitude mountainous areas tends to decline during the warm season and increase during the cold season cook et al 2020 a similar distribution can also be found in central asia where more negative changes in total runoff occur in the warm season than the cold season fig 4h l in general the cold season precipitation of central asia occurs mainly in the form of snow which cannot directly transform into total runoff before the warm season as mentioned above global warming leads to more rainfall but not snowfall in the cold season and therefore increased total runoff accordingly the diminished snowpack in the cold season will limit the availability of runoff in the following warm season fig 4h from the water budget perspective the increase in precipitation should be balanced by the runoff soil moisture and evaporation therefore the discrepancy between the response of precipitation and soil moisture runoff highlights the importance of the change in evapotranspiration that is tightly connected with warming on the other hand all four hydroclimate variables show significant increases in northeastern central asia mostly in northwest china which is a typical dry area considering the enhanced temperature in northwest china fig 1d it seems likely that the future climate will make this area warmer and wetter which should have a relieving effect on the risk of meteorological agricultural and hydrological drought via the enhanced land air interaction furthermore this wet bias in northwest china has been projected by both cmip6 and cmip5 models dong and dong 2021 guo et al 2021 3 1 5 aridity index in a warming climate the enhancing potential evapotranspiration is the key factor leading to the increased frequency of heat extremes and drought events in asia dai et al 2004 therefore combining the effects of precipitation and evapotranspiration is crucial for projecting drought in central asia fig 5 shows the future change in ai which is defined by the ratio between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration the difference between the historical period 1995 2014 and modeled future 2081 2100 period is used to quantify the future changes in drought the results show obvious increases in ai i e wetting by 10 20 20 30 over most of northwest china and western mongolia under the ssp2 4 5 ssp5 8 5 scenario but significant decreases drying over the rest of central asia in particular the annual ai decreases i e indicative of drying by 20 30 ssp2 4 5 and 30 40 ssp5 8 5 over most of kazakhstan tajikistan and area to its south studies based on cmip5 model results found that temperature precipitation and potential evapotranspiration will increase over the drylands of asia in the 21st century zhao et al 2014 zhao and dai 2017 as a typical dryland region central asia is characterized by strong warming and accounts for most of the increases in temperature over continental land during the last century huang et al 2017 from fig 1c and d and fig 2 we can see that the warming over western central asia could result in enhanced dry conditions in the future fig 4 therefore the persistent warming over the drylands of western central asia suggests the drying trend may continue to the end of this century 3 2 future changes in drought events 3 2 1 drought frequency fig 6 shows the future distribution of drought frequency separately constructed based on precipitation and ai in terms of the multi model ensemble mean generally the frequency pattern of precipitation based drought events in central asia is characterized by higher values in the west and lower values in the east by the end of the century fig 6a b their peak frequency exceeds one event per year under both ssp scenarios with the highest frequencies located in southwestern central asia including the southern caspian sea turkmenistan uzbekistan and western tajikistan similar to the analysis in the previous section low drought frequency tends to occur in the eastern part of central asia including northwest china and western mongolia the frequency patterns basically reflect the changes in precipitation fig 4a e and i the frequency of ai based drought events also shows northwest china and western mongolia to have relatively low frequencies fig 6c d compared with precipitation based drought events the frequency of ai based events is generally higher in most areas of central asia in particular under the ssp5 8 5 scenario most of northern central asia will experience more than two drought events per year by the end of this century as for the changes in meteorological drought frequency fig 7a b the responses to the two scenarios are characterized by an asymmetric west east dipole pattern i e a strong decrease in the east but a relatively weaker increase in the west moreover the high end forcing pathway i e ssp5 8 5 will likely result in more significant east west contrast in frequency variation in the region fig 7b when evapotranspiration is included in the definition of drought i e ai based drought events the robust increases in drought event frequency are mainly concentrated in northern central asia fig 7c d with extremely low inter model discrepancies regarding the drought frequency distribution this frequency pattern is markedly different to the dipolar pattern found for meteorological drought events which suggests that the potential evapotranspiration as well as the warming could cause more drought events even in the context of increasing precipitation 3 2 2 drought duration from the distribution of meteorological drought duration shown in fig 8a and b long lasting drought events tend to occur in the west and northwest edge zones of central asia especially in the north and west edge zones of the region meteorological drought events might last more than 2 months under ssp5 8 5 fig 8b in terms of the duration of drought events based on ai fig 8c d most regions of central asia are projected to experience durations that are shorter than those of the meteorological drought events although the spatial patterns of the two kinds of drought duration are similar in general continuous warming has the effect of extending the duration of drought events over most of central asia fig 9 comparing the patterns of change in frequency fig 7a b and duration fig 9a b for meteorological drought events the duration distribution shows more consistent changes than the frequency distribution this difference suggests that the change in drought duration is more dependent on temperature variation than that of drought frequency that is even though meteorological drought events may become less frequent in the future such as the frequencies shown under the ssp2 4 5 scenario fig 7a the drought duration will still increase over most of central asia fig 9a 3 2 3 drought area fig 10 shows the temporal evolutions of the area percentage of drought events based on precipitation and ai except for the interannual variances the drought area displays an indistinct or weak decreasing trend since 2015 in the time series of meteorological drought events in the period 2015 2100 the area percentage of meteorological drought events remains at a very low level of about under 6 in most years as shown by fig 4a this feature is mainly contributed by the increases in precipitation in most of central asia however the area of ai based drought events shows noticeable increases since 2015 during 2015 2100 the area percentage of ai based drought increases by 2 0 and 3 9 under ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 respectively this can be explained by the fact that the increase in evaporative demand overwhelms the increase in precipitation which leads to the overall drying trend in central asia against the background of continuous warming previous research has also indicated a general drying tendency in central asia based on a combined climatological deviation index yang et al 2020 their study also suggested that central asia might become more vulnerable to drought in the future when simultaneously taking into account the background warming and precipitation deficit 3 2 4 drought pattern in term of ai the grid cells in central asia can be classified as dry zone transitional zone and wet zone fig 11 according to the definitions presented in section 2 2 for the historical period 1995 2014 fig 11a the dry land areas are mainly distributed in southeastern central asia including northwest china and western mongolia and southwestern central asia including uzbekistan turkmenistan and areas to their south the wet land areas meanwhile are located in the northern half of central asia and the mountainous countries between the two dry zones fig 11a as expected the transitional zones are mainly distributed at the edges of the dry and wet zones as well as in tibetan areas fig 11a with the long term warming under the two ssps the above climate zones can change from one type to another fig 11b c for instance under both ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 all the wet zones except for part of northeastern central asia fig 11 b c will experience a drying transition similarly almost all transitional zones demonstrate consistent drying however the two main dry zones show completely opposite tendencies an even drier condition in southwestern central asia but a wetter condition in southeastern comparing the changes under ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 fig 11b and c the dry wet change in northwest china and western mongolia is insensitive to the choice of emissions pathway certainly more intensified greenhouse gas forcing will reduce the area of the wet to wetter zone in northeastern central asia in general however the enhancing evapotranspiration under the future warming climate will likely increase the dry zone area in central asia and thus potentially the area of desert too ma et al 2021 4 summary one of the key issues when attempting to predict the effects of climate change in the future is the regional drying and wetting responses to anthropogenic forcing in this work we use the results of multiple state of the art models participating in cmip6 to examine the projected changes in hydroclimate and drought characteristics between the historical 1995 2014 and future 2081 2100 periods under the ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios over central asia the analysis provides detailed information on the drying and wetting changes in response to global warming along different emission pathways from different definitions of drought the main findings can be summarized as follows 1 the projected long term 2081 2100 change in temperature indicates a consistent accelerated warming of 3 1 k under ssp2 4 5 and 6 1 k under ssp5 8 5 relative to the historical period 1995 2014 based on 22 cmip6 models the spatial pattern of the future temperature change shows maximal warming in northern central asia mainly in kazakhstan and the mountainous areas in the southeast of the region extreme warming tends to occur in the southwest and east of central asia 2 the multi model ensemble means under the two ssps display persistent increases in both precipitation and evapotranspiration during the whole of the 21st century however the increase in evapotranspiration is projected to exceed lag behind the increase in precipitation since 2030 in the warm cold season which will result in enhanced drought conditions in the warm season 3 the projected changes in surface soil moisture reveal an overall decrease in central asia in the future because the increase in evapotranspiration overwhelms the increase in precipitation in the warm season the multi model ensemble mean total runoff reveals a decrease in the warm season due to increasing temperature but an increase in the cold season due to increasing precipitation both the surface soil moisture and total runoff of central asia show strong spatial heterogeneity in their future changes which are generally characterized by asymmetric east west dipole patterns with decreases in the west and northwest but increases in the east 4 drought events defined by precipitation and ai are projected to last longer in the future from meteorological drought a greater frequent of events with longer duration are projected in southwestern central asia by the end of this century whereas drought events defined by ai which combines both precipitation and potential evapotranspiration are more spatially consistent in the region all of central asia apart from a small area in the southeast is projected to experience more ai based drought events that are longer in duration on the basis of these results the projected changes in droughts are stronger under the more severe forcing and warming scenarios for most variables which serves as encouragement for every country in central asia to follow a lower emissions pathway to slow down the future drying trend however for southeastern central asia particularly northwest china a warmer and wetter tendency in the future shi et al 2007 is also projected by most cmip6 models regardless of the drought definition this seems beneficial for alleviating the extremely dry condition in this area in the warming world it should also be pointed out that the model projections of future precipitation and other hydrological variables still remain uncertain over many areas including central asia for example there are wet biases in precipitation over northwest china dong and dong 2021 guo et al 2021 therefore it is necessary to carry out more detailed investigations on the likely causes of the changes in multiple hydroclimatic variables through more targeted simulations and predictions credit

7870,study region central asia study focus the possible future changes in meteorological hydrological and agricultural drought in central asia are analyzed based on the multi model projections from phase 6 of the coupled model intercomparison project cmip6 the changes in hydroclimate variables and drought events are examined to reveal the responses to different emissions pathway by comparing the historical period 1995 2014 and future period 2081 2100 new hydrological insights for the region corresponding to the spatially consistent warming in central asia an asymmetrical west east orientated dipole precipitation pattern i e a decrease in the west but an increase in the east is found in the warm season april to september precipitation of future projections a similar but even stronger west east or northwest southeast contrast is found in the changes in total runoff and surface soil moisture in response to future warming most of central asia shows an increase in drought frequency and duration by the end of the current century mainly caused by the consistently enhanced evaporation that roughly balances the precipitation growth after 2030 when the effect of temperature is considered the drought area of central asia displays a significant upward trend under both the moderate and high emissions pathway however in the east of the region including northwest china and western mongolia warming and wetting tendencies under the future warming climate are apparent regardless of the drought definition graphical abstract ga1 keywords drought hydroclimatology future projection precipitation central asia cmip6 1 introduction drought which is mainly induced by precipitation deficiency is one of the most concerning types of climatological disaster and natural hazard mckee et al 1993 central asia including the countries of kazakhstan uzbekistan turkmenistan kyrgyzstan and tajikistan as well as the western part of northwest china fig 1a is one of the most arid regions in the world moreover the region is sensitive and vulnerable to rapid climate change due to its scarcity of water resources and complex terrain giorgi 2006 lioubimtseva and henebry 2009 tucker et al 2015 de beurs et al 2018 in recent decades central asia has experienced a significant increase in temperature but an unobvious decrease in precipitation lioubimtseva 2015 de beurs et al 2018 the assessment and projection of water resources and drought could therefore provide valuable information for improving adaptive strategies for central asia in general drought can be classified into four categories meteorological drought agricultural or soil moisture drought hydrological drought and socioeconomic drought van loon et al 2015 precipitation deficiency is the main factor considered for meteorological drought as a typical continental climate zone most parts of central asia are vulnerable to drought owing to the scarcity of precipitation although central asia has shown a weak overall drying trend in recent decades the occurrence of drought in the region is characterized by significant spatiotemporal variations li et al 2017 guo et al 2018 zhong et al 2021 including wetting trends in the eastern part of central asia but obvious drying trends in most western areas considering the regional declines in precipitation and enhanced evaporation induced by increasing greenhouse gas concentrations it is expected that the frequency and severity of drought will increase in the warming world of the future dai et al 2004 sheffield and wood 2008 dai 2011a 2011b 2013 cook et al 2014 huang et al 2016 central asia has experienced complex changes in precipitation and temperature under the climate changes related to greenhouse gas emissions hydrological variations and land use cover changes lioubimtseva 2015 de beurs et al 2018 similar to other typical arid and semi arid areas chen et al 2009 ji et al 2014 huang et al 2017 central asia has a higher mean warming rate than the global terrestrial mean moreover the warming rate of central asia was higher in the first decade of the 21st century but relatively lower beforehand hu et al 2014 in terms of seasonal variability precipitation in central asia shows strong spatial heterogeneity characterized by the peak rainfall amount occurring in spring and winter over southwestern central asia but in summer over northern and southeastern parts shi et al 2007 lioubimtseva and henebry 2009 wei et al 2010 klein et al 2012 lioubimtseva 2015 song bai 2016 zhong et al 2022 comparably the variation in precipitation in central asia is more complex and uncertain than that in temperature hu et al 2016 under the significant warming trend the regional annual mean precipitation of central asia displays a weak decreasing trend simultaneously with increasing variability superimposed on the long term trend in recent decades yin et al 2016 li et al 2017 which is caused by the divergent responses of precipitation over different areas of central asia to global warming li et al 2017 zhong et al 2021 in addition the responses of drought to warming also rely on the characteristics of the analyzed area seasons and different drought related variables as a key factor that determines surface hydrological and agro ecological drought soil moisture is a good indicator of the wetness and dryness of the climate the variation in soil moisture can reflect the background climate change including the variation in air temperature precipitation solar radiation and so on in central asia the average soil moisture is low particularly in kazakhstan turkmenistan and northwest china li et al 2015 z li et al 2015 moreover the spatial mean soil moisture in central asia has displayed a declining trend over the past several decades li et al 2017 however the soil moisture trend in central asia also shows a heterogeneous distribution consisting of decreasing trends in the five central asian countries owing to significantly increased temperatures but a gradual increasing trend in northwest china because of enhanced moisture transport li et al 2015 zhong et al 2022 aside from precipitation temperature and soil moisture runoff can also influence the regional dryness and wetness and lead to hydrological drought runoff changes in a complex way influenced by both natural variability and human activity especially in arid and semi arid regions in drought periods the reduced precipitation lower inflow and the diversion of inflow for irrigation have resulted in the shrinking of the aral sea micklin 2016 the variation in runoff recharge in central asia is jointly impacted by the natural variability related to precipitation and the melting of glaciers sorg et al 2012 gan et al 2015 over the past few decades most river runoff in central asia has displayed an increasing trend li et al 2017 model projections suggest that the runoff from melting glaciers will not change much in the near future but reduced precipitation snowmelt and intensified evapotranspiration will ultimately lead to decreased runoff in central asia gan et al 2015 future climate projections from phases 3 and 5 of the coupled model intercomparison project cmip3 and cmip5 meehl et al 2007 meehl and bony 2012 have been widely used to investigate the projected mean or changes in extreme temperature precipitation and other variables under different 21st century emission scenarios e g thibeault et al 2010 yang et al 2011 toreti et al 2013 ukkola et al 2018 wan et al 2018 cmip5 projections suggest central asia will become warmer in the coming decades accompanied by inconsistent changes in precipitation in a dipole pattern with drying in the southwest but wetting in the northeast reyer et al 2017 which is divergent from the projected increase in precipitation in dryland areas globally zhao et al 2014 in addition greater runoff is projected due to the increasingly rapid melting of glaciers and snow as well as the transition from snow to rain in the near term future but decreasing water availability in the medium to long term reyer et al 2017 cook et al 2020 recently the outputs of the state of the art models involved in phase 6 of the coupled model intercomparison project cmip6 eyring et al 2016 whose aim it was to overcome the drawbacks of their cmip5 counterparts rivera and arnould 2020 have begun to be released cmip6 projections indicate that the increases in soil moisture in central asia will be partially offset by an increasing contribution from evaporation zhao and dai 2022 therefore against the background of future warming potential evapotranspiration has an increasing tendency and thus exerts a drying effect on soils reyer et al 2017 clearly there are still some important issues related to future climate change that need to be clarified for central asia the responses of drought in the region to future climate changes particularly the spatial distributions of variations and uncertainties against different backgrounds of climate change are still unclear and deserving of further exploration focusing on the hydroclimatic changes in the 21st century this work seeks to uncover the patterns of change in the main variables related to the dry and wet states in central asia under different climate scenarios from the future climate projections of cmip6 to the best of our knowledge the possible future changes in drought and the regional hydroclimate have not yet been comprehensively investigated for central asia on the basis of cmip6 outputs yet such work is critical for revealing the future variations in drought related variables toward a better understanding of the changes in regional dryness and wetness against the background of climate change in our most state of the art models multiple indicators of drought have been used to reflect regional dryness and wetness in central asia from different physical perspectives e g bothe et al 2012 huang et al 2017 li et al 2017 guo et al 2018 in this study precipitation soil moisture and runoff are used to reflect the water cycle in the definitions of meteorological drought agricultural drought and hydrological drought respectively variations in soil moisture and runoff mainly reflect the change in water content at the terrestrial interface in which soil moisture is a particularly valuable measure to reflect local and regional dryness and wetness li et al 2017 compared with precipitation soil moisture and runoff are more directly connected with temperature and thus feature more robust and widespread drying with global warming because of the enhanced moisture demand of evapotranspiration dai et al 2018 mankin et al 2019 in this paper we focus on discussing the spatiotemporal changes in precipitation surface soil moisture and runoff in order to examine the model simulated hydroclimatic changes additionally considering the skill levels of global climate models in projecting soil moisture and runoff are lower than they are for precipitation zhao and dai 2015 ukkola et al 2018 this study uses precipitation and aridity index to identify drought events in which the latter considers potential evapotranspiration 2 materials and methods 2 1 data and analysis method in this work the historical and future projections of cmip6 models are applied to explore the changes in dryness and wetness in central asia compared to cmip5 the latest climate models in cmip6 are driven by different emission and land use scenarios namely the shared socioeconomic pathways ssps o neill et al 2016 these scenarios provide new opportunities to investigate the possible changes in precipitation evaporation soil moisture runoff and aridity conditions over central asia under different development and radiative forcing scenarios under the cmip6 framework natural and anthropogenic climate forcing are simulated in the historical period from 1850 to 2014 and in the future projections from 2015 to 2100 in total 22 coupled global climate models are selected from cmip6 table 1 for the present study with one run per model forced by two emission scenarios i e the medium forcing pathway ssp2 4 5 and the high end forcing fossil fueled development pathway ssp5 8 5 these two future projections together with the historical simulations are separately applied to extract the future and historical characteristics of hydroclimate variables in central asia the differences in these variables between the historical period 1995 2014 and future period 2081 2100 are ultimately used to represent the possible spatial and temporal variability of the drought pattern under different emission scenarios the change in precipitation only reflects the variation in dryness and wetness from the perspective of meteorological drought here to additionally reflect the perspectives of hydrological and agricultural drought we also explore the responses of soil moisture and runoff respectively through synthesizing future estimates of hydrological variables in central asia we can obtain the possible tendencies of drought from different perspectives from the above cmip6 models table 1 the monthly projections of near surface air temperature precipitation evapotranspiration surface soil moisture and total runoff flux are extracted all selected variables are regridded onto a 2 5 2 5 horizontal grid for the regridded output of each model the potential evapotranspiration is calculated by using the penman monteith parameterization as in the work of zhao and dai 2022 the anomaly fields of the variables discussed in this study are calculated relative to the historical climatology of 1995 2014 considering the hydroclimatic changes in response to global warming possess strong seasonality composite analysis is conducted for both the warm season april to september and cold season october to next march the multi model ensemble mean is derived by averaging all the regridded model data 2 2 drought events definitions and classification of aridity in addition to precipitation soil moisture and runoff it is necessary to show more physical aspects of drought events in the warming environment through considering the scarcity of water supply caused by the increasing atmospheric demand of water vapor potential evapotranspiration which depends heavily on the variation in temperature reyer et al 2017 should be given more consideration when studying drought in a warmer world accordingly in the present work the influence of potential evapotranspiration is considered in the definitions of drought by introducing the aridity index ai greve et al 2014 huang et al 2017 which is defined by the precipitation to potential evapotranspiration ratio this index is characterized by the long term balance between water supply from the atmosphere and the atmospheric demand for moisture and has been widely applied to measure changes in aridity e g feng and fu 2013 greve et al 2014 ukkola et al 2018 similar to the work of zhao and dai 2015 we define drought events by the monthly drought variables being lower than the 10th percentile of the historical 1995 2014 climate in each grid cell for each model since our focus is on the effects of precipitation and warming on changes in drought events variables including precipitation and ai are used to define drought events for each model selected in this study table 1 a 3 month running smoother is applied to the monthly precipitation and ai data in the ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios to filter out short term variations before the drought event detection process is carried out this study mainly focuses on the annual drought frequency duration and area which are the most critical and fundamental properties of drought andreadis et al 2005 the annual drought frequency is defined as the number of drought events in each grid cell during each calendar year in order to avoid the difficulty in defining drought events covering multiple years the month with the lowest precipitation or ai in the life cycle is considered as the occurrence time of that drought event drought duration is defined by the total number of consecutive months the drought lasts and drought area is represented by the percentage of the drought s extent with respect to the total area of central asia all the above metrics of drought events are averaged over the models selected from cmip6 to obtain their multi model ensemble mean in addition the annual mean ai is used to demonstrate the historical and future patterns of drought based on the ai in each grid cell the aridity conditions of central asia are classified into three zones hulme 1996 huang et al 2017 ukkola et al 2018 dry ai 0 65 transitional 0 65 ai 1 and wet ai 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 projected changes in hydroclimate variables under the warming climate 3 1 1 temperature broadly central asia can be separated into two parts fig 1a the west and the east divided by the wet and high altitude mountains between baldwin and vecchi 2016 in the eastern part the kunlun and tianshan mountains surrounds the tarim basin with extreme aridity the western part is characterized by flat terrain with several lakes including the caspian and aral seas and lake balkash located from west to east from the temperature variations of central asia shown in fig 1b under both the medium ssp2 4 5 and high end ssp5 8 5 emission scenarios accelerated warming exists in the region from roughly around the 1980 s obvious overlap exists between the two scenarios before about 2035 in terms of their warming periods fig 1b thereafter however a slower warming rate is gradually displayed in the more aggressive mitigation scenario of ssp2 4 5 relative to the historical temperature during 1995 2014 the ensemble mean warming reaches about 3 1 k for ssp2 4 5 and 6 1 k for ssp5 8 5 by the last 20 years of the 21st century furthermore the spatial distributions of temperature projections reveal quasi consistent warming in central asia under both the ssp2 4 5 fig 1c and ssp5 8 5 fig 1d scenario based on the 22 cmip6 models selected generally speaking based on cmip6 projections the warming rate of central asia is higher than the global mean in which relatively stronger warming tends to occur in kazakhstan northwest china and the mountainous area fig 1c d the features of the warming patterns shown in their annual means fig 1c d are found in both the warm and cold seasons but the maximal warming rate occurs in summer under both scenarios figure omitted moreover a similar warming distribution to those shown in fig 1c and d is also projected by cmip5 models dong et al 2018 suggesting the responses of central asia to future warming are robust over most mid latitude areas of the northern hemisphere the warming of hot extremes is happening faster than that of the mean temperature vogel et al 2017 consequently drought and other land atmosphere feedbacks induced by hot extremes are usually found to be more intense than those induced by mean warming donat et al 2018 in this study the local 90th percentile of temperature t 90 in each grid cell is used as the threshold to define extreme temperature for the historical 1995 2014 and future 2081 2100 projections the local mean air temperature t mean is also computed in each grid cell furthermore the long term changes of t 90 and t mean between the historical and future periods i e t 90 and t mean are combined as the ratio t 90 t mean to examine the relative change in extreme heat with respect to the background mean warming fig 2 displays the spatial distributions of the responses of t 90 t mean to global warming under the two ssps considered the projected temperature extremes tend to reinforce in a wide quasi zonal band from the southwest to the northeast of central asia the highest ratio of t 90 t mean can reach about 1 2 1 3 over the southwest corner of central asia under ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 respectively in eastern central asia northwestern china and western mongolia a similar amplification of high temperature extremes is experienced particularly under the ssp2 4 5 scenario fig 2a compared with the medium emissions pathway i e ssp2 4 5 which has roughly equivalent effects in the southwest and east of central asia fig 2a the high end emissions pathway i e ssp5 8 5 tends to reinforce the temperature extremes in the southwest fig 2b 3 1 2 precipitation and evapotranspiration regionally precipitation soil moisture runoff and evapotranspiration have been markedly affected by global warming characterized by responses that are far more complicated than those of temperature zhao and dai 2015 projected the annual precipitation over most of eurasia to increase by about 10 30 during the last three decades of the current century under the rcp4 5 scenario compared to the historical record ma et al 2021 suggested that precipitation and actual evapotranspiration will increase in the future under global warming similar results can also be found in fig 3a and d of the present study which demonstrate the comparable and robust increasing trends in the regional means of annual precipitation and evapotranspiration since the 1980 s under both ssps comparing the projections based on ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 that of the milder pathway i e ssp2 4 5 features decelerated increases in both variables during the last three decades of the current century in contrast under the ssp5 8 5 scenario the two variables display continuous increases throughout the whole of the 21st century on average the annual precipitation of central asia increases by about 15 from 1995 2014 to 2081 2100 under ssp5 8 5 fig 3d a similar but lower magnitude increase is found under the ssp2 4 5 scenario the net effect of precipitation and evapotranspiration is largely responsible for determining the basic state of regional dryness and wetness the increase in annual mean evapotranspiration offsets most of the increase in precipitation as the land surface temperature rises zhao and dai 2015 which leads to less surface soil moisture and runoff flux however the role of evapotranspiration overwhelms that of precipitation in the warm season fig 3b e and vice versa in the cold season fig 3c f in the cold season the input of water from precipitation is generally larger than the loss of water through evapotranspiration which leads to the increasing trend of cold season runoff fig 3c f it is worth noting that the increase in future precipitation is mainly induced by increases in heavy precipitation but not the rainfall frequency sun et al 2007 although uncertainties exist in models cmip6 models perform better than cmip5 models in their simulation of extreme precipitation over asia dong and dong 2021 from the spatial distribution shown in fig 4a the largest increase in precipitation reaches 20 30 in southeastern central asia mainly concentrated in northwest china in the warm season fig 4e the spatial heterogeneity of precipitation becomes significant characterized by a zonal dipole like anomaly with a decrease in the west but an increase in the east considering the inconsistent seasonal responses in western central asia in different seasons fig 4e i the precipitation of eastern central asia features weak seasonality although the strongest increase occurs in the cold season fig 4i it should be noted that the precipitation simulated by most cmip6 models is close to that of observations over western central asia although wet biases exist in northwest china dong and dong 2021 guo et al 2021 the rising temperature results in accelerated soil water consumption as well as an increase in evapotranspiration this is one of the major drivers of agricultural and hydrological droughts as mentioned above and shown in table 2 there is better coherence between the regionally averaged precipitation and evapotranspiration for the whole year with those of the warm season than there is with those of the cold season jiang et al 2020 the evapotranspiration in the cold season fig 4j increases remarkably over northwestern central asia and with greater dependence on the changes in temperature fig 1d than precipitation fig 4i 3 1 3 surface soil moisture the soil moisture in the surface layer is influenced the most by climate change as compared with other layers li et al 2015 as can be seen in fig 3 the annual surface soil moisture shows a weak decreasing trend under both the ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenario the standard deviation among models is also shown in fig 3 indicating consistent decreasing trends of soil moisture across most models this is largely caused by the increase in precipitation being insufficient to counteract the increase in evapotranspiration in particular the projection under ssp5 8 5 shows more distinct declining trends in annual surface soil moisture than that under ssp2 4 5 after about 2050 highlighting the role of the enhanced evaporative demand of the atmosphere and vegetation as warming intensifies therefore the continuous increase in evaporation tends to accelerate the consumption of soil moisture and thus amplify the risk of regional drought in central asia in the future this coincides closely with the frequency of soil moisture based drought events in central asia in cmip5 projections zhao and dai 2015 in terms of seasonality it is natural to expect the surface soil moisture to decline in the warm season because of the enhanced evaporative demand especially under ssp5 8 5 in this respect under both ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 partial correlation analysis table 2 indicates that the change in surface soil moisture is determined more by changes in evaporation in the warm season whereas it is controlled more by precipitation in the cold season therefore the concurrent increasing trends of surface air temperature and evaporation along with the decreasing trend of surface soil moisture may trigger and amplify the risk of agricultural drought in a warmer climate especially in the warm season in terms of spatial distribution ssp5 8 5 projections show more heterogenous changes in surface soil moisture than those in precipitation all year round fig 4c g k except for the wetting response seen in the southeast of the region all of central asia shows a strong decrease in annual mean surface soil moisture fig 4c as shown in fig 4g and k soil moisture deficits are more widespread in the warm season than the cold season coinciding with the contracting wetting area in southeast central asia from the annual and seasonal responses of precipitation and surface soil moisture shown in fig 4 we can conclude that the more severe development pathway i e ssp5 8 5 is likely to cause more extensive agricultural drought than meteorological drought in central asia 3 1 4 total runoff flux the partial correlation analysis results presented in table 2 also reveal that the changes in total runoff correlate significantly with those in precipitation in annual and seasonal mean terms additionally the cold season evapotranspiration and warm season surface soil moisture also correlate closely with the runoff variations in general the trends of total runoff are mainly determined by the relative strength between precipitation and evapotranspiration the total runoff shows decreasing increasing trends in the warm cold season fig 3b c e and f because the increases in evapotranspiration offset a large portion of the precipitation induced increases in runoff in the warm season over central asia zhao and dai 2015 similar results have also been reported on the basis of cmip5 model projections gan et al 2015 it should also be noted that snowmelt glacial melt and baseflow are also important for the runoff in central asia under a warming climate according to gan et al 2015 the determining factor for snowmelt in the future will be precipitation whereas glacier melt will mainly be driven by future changes in temperature during the cold season the increase in total runoff is partly attributable to the expectation that precipitation will fall more as rain rather than snow against a background of warming cook et al 2020 at the same time the increased precipitation can in turn enhance snowmelt in winter and early spring and further reinforce the runoff fig 3c f fig 4d h and l show that the increases in annual total runoff flux are concentrated in the mountainous areas and northwest china whereas the decreases are mainly in the area of the caspian sea and central and western areas of kazakhstan fig 4d in general the runoff in high northern latitudes and mid latitude mountainous areas tends to decline during the warm season and increase during the cold season cook et al 2020 a similar distribution can also be found in central asia where more negative changes in total runoff occur in the warm season than the cold season fig 4h l in general the cold season precipitation of central asia occurs mainly in the form of snow which cannot directly transform into total runoff before the warm season as mentioned above global warming leads to more rainfall but not snowfall in the cold season and therefore increased total runoff accordingly the diminished snowpack in the cold season will limit the availability of runoff in the following warm season fig 4h from the water budget perspective the increase in precipitation should be balanced by the runoff soil moisture and evaporation therefore the discrepancy between the response of precipitation and soil moisture runoff highlights the importance of the change in evapotranspiration that is tightly connected with warming on the other hand all four hydroclimate variables show significant increases in northeastern central asia mostly in northwest china which is a typical dry area considering the enhanced temperature in northwest china fig 1d it seems likely that the future climate will make this area warmer and wetter which should have a relieving effect on the risk of meteorological agricultural and hydrological drought via the enhanced land air interaction furthermore this wet bias in northwest china has been projected by both cmip6 and cmip5 models dong and dong 2021 guo et al 2021 3 1 5 aridity index in a warming climate the enhancing potential evapotranspiration is the key factor leading to the increased frequency of heat extremes and drought events in asia dai et al 2004 therefore combining the effects of precipitation and evapotranspiration is crucial for projecting drought in central asia fig 5 shows the future change in ai which is defined by the ratio between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration the difference between the historical period 1995 2014 and modeled future 2081 2100 period is used to quantify the future changes in drought the results show obvious increases in ai i e wetting by 10 20 20 30 over most of northwest china and western mongolia under the ssp2 4 5 ssp5 8 5 scenario but significant decreases drying over the rest of central asia in particular the annual ai decreases i e indicative of drying by 20 30 ssp2 4 5 and 30 40 ssp5 8 5 over most of kazakhstan tajikistan and area to its south studies based on cmip5 model results found that temperature precipitation and potential evapotranspiration will increase over the drylands of asia in the 21st century zhao et al 2014 zhao and dai 2017 as a typical dryland region central asia is characterized by strong warming and accounts for most of the increases in temperature over continental land during the last century huang et al 2017 from fig 1c and d and fig 2 we can see that the warming over western central asia could result in enhanced dry conditions in the future fig 4 therefore the persistent warming over the drylands of western central asia suggests the drying trend may continue to the end of this century 3 2 future changes in drought events 3 2 1 drought frequency fig 6 shows the future distribution of drought frequency separately constructed based on precipitation and ai in terms of the multi model ensemble mean generally the frequency pattern of precipitation based drought events in central asia is characterized by higher values in the west and lower values in the east by the end of the century fig 6a b their peak frequency exceeds one event per year under both ssp scenarios with the highest frequencies located in southwestern central asia including the southern caspian sea turkmenistan uzbekistan and western tajikistan similar to the analysis in the previous section low drought frequency tends to occur in the eastern part of central asia including northwest china and western mongolia the frequency patterns basically reflect the changes in precipitation fig 4a e and i the frequency of ai based drought events also shows northwest china and western mongolia to have relatively low frequencies fig 6c d compared with precipitation based drought events the frequency of ai based events is generally higher in most areas of central asia in particular under the ssp5 8 5 scenario most of northern central asia will experience more than two drought events per year by the end of this century as for the changes in meteorological drought frequency fig 7a b the responses to the two scenarios are characterized by an asymmetric west east dipole pattern i e a strong decrease in the east but a relatively weaker increase in the west moreover the high end forcing pathway i e ssp5 8 5 will likely result in more significant east west contrast in frequency variation in the region fig 7b when evapotranspiration is included in the definition of drought i e ai based drought events the robust increases in drought event frequency are mainly concentrated in northern central asia fig 7c d with extremely low inter model discrepancies regarding the drought frequency distribution this frequency pattern is markedly different to the dipolar pattern found for meteorological drought events which suggests that the potential evapotranspiration as well as the warming could cause more drought events even in the context of increasing precipitation 3 2 2 drought duration from the distribution of meteorological drought duration shown in fig 8a and b long lasting drought events tend to occur in the west and northwest edge zones of central asia especially in the north and west edge zones of the region meteorological drought events might last more than 2 months under ssp5 8 5 fig 8b in terms of the duration of drought events based on ai fig 8c d most regions of central asia are projected to experience durations that are shorter than those of the meteorological drought events although the spatial patterns of the two kinds of drought duration are similar in general continuous warming has the effect of extending the duration of drought events over most of central asia fig 9 comparing the patterns of change in frequency fig 7a b and duration fig 9a b for meteorological drought events the duration distribution shows more consistent changes than the frequency distribution this difference suggests that the change in drought duration is more dependent on temperature variation than that of drought frequency that is even though meteorological drought events may become less frequent in the future such as the frequencies shown under the ssp2 4 5 scenario fig 7a the drought duration will still increase over most of central asia fig 9a 3 2 3 drought area fig 10 shows the temporal evolutions of the area percentage of drought events based on precipitation and ai except for the interannual variances the drought area displays an indistinct or weak decreasing trend since 2015 in the time series of meteorological drought events in the period 2015 2100 the area percentage of meteorological drought events remains at a very low level of about under 6 in most years as shown by fig 4a this feature is mainly contributed by the increases in precipitation in most of central asia however the area of ai based drought events shows noticeable increases since 2015 during 2015 2100 the area percentage of ai based drought increases by 2 0 and 3 9 under ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 respectively this can be explained by the fact that the increase in evaporative demand overwhelms the increase in precipitation which leads to the overall drying trend in central asia against the background of continuous warming previous research has also indicated a general drying tendency in central asia based on a combined climatological deviation index yang et al 2020 their study also suggested that central asia might become more vulnerable to drought in the future when simultaneously taking into account the background warming and precipitation deficit 3 2 4 drought pattern in term of ai the grid cells in central asia can be classified as dry zone transitional zone and wet zone fig 11 according to the definitions presented in section 2 2 for the historical period 1995 2014 fig 11a the dry land areas are mainly distributed in southeastern central asia including northwest china and western mongolia and southwestern central asia including uzbekistan turkmenistan and areas to their south the wet land areas meanwhile are located in the northern half of central asia and the mountainous countries between the two dry zones fig 11a as expected the transitional zones are mainly distributed at the edges of the dry and wet zones as well as in tibetan areas fig 11a with the long term warming under the two ssps the above climate zones can change from one type to another fig 11b c for instance under both ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 all the wet zones except for part of northeastern central asia fig 11 b c will experience a drying transition similarly almost all transitional zones demonstrate consistent drying however the two main dry zones show completely opposite tendencies an even drier condition in southwestern central asia but a wetter condition in southeastern comparing the changes under ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 fig 11b and c the dry wet change in northwest china and western mongolia is insensitive to the choice of emissions pathway certainly more intensified greenhouse gas forcing will reduce the area of the wet to wetter zone in northeastern central asia in general however the enhancing evapotranspiration under the future warming climate will likely increase the dry zone area in central asia and thus potentially the area of desert too ma et al 2021 4 summary one of the key issues when attempting to predict the effects of climate change in the future is the regional drying and wetting responses to anthropogenic forcing in this work we use the results of multiple state of the art models participating in cmip6 to examine the projected changes in hydroclimate and drought characteristics between the historical 1995 2014 and future 2081 2100 periods under the ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios over central asia the analysis provides detailed information on the drying and wetting changes in response to global warming along different emission pathways from different definitions of drought the main findings can be summarized as follows 1 the projected long term 2081 2100 change in temperature indicates a consistent accelerated warming of 3 1 k under ssp2 4 5 and 6 1 k under ssp5 8 5 relative to the historical period 1995 2014 based on 22 cmip6 models the spatial pattern of the future temperature change shows maximal warming in northern central asia mainly in kazakhstan and the mountainous areas in the southeast of the region extreme warming tends to occur in the southwest and east of central asia 2 the multi model ensemble means under the two ssps display persistent increases in both precipitation and evapotranspiration during the whole of the 21st century however the increase in evapotranspiration is projected to exceed lag behind the increase in precipitation since 2030 in the warm cold season which will result in enhanced drought conditions in the warm season 3 the projected changes in surface soil moisture reveal an overall decrease in central asia in the future because the increase in evapotranspiration overwhelms the increase in precipitation in the warm season the multi model ensemble mean total runoff reveals a decrease in the warm season due to increasing temperature but an increase in the cold season due to increasing precipitation both the surface soil moisture and total runoff of central asia show strong spatial heterogeneity in their future changes which are generally characterized by asymmetric east west dipole patterns with decreases in the west and northwest but increases in the east 4 drought events defined by precipitation and ai are projected to last longer in the future from meteorological drought a greater frequent of events with longer duration are projected in southwestern central asia by the end of this century whereas drought events defined by ai which combines both precipitation and potential evapotranspiration are more spatially consistent in the region all of central asia apart from a small area in the southeast is projected to experience more ai based drought events that are longer in duration on the basis of these results the projected changes in droughts are stronger under the more severe forcing and warming scenarios for most variables which serves as encouragement for every country in central asia to follow a lower emissions pathway to slow down the future drying trend however for southeastern central asia particularly northwest china a warmer and wetter tendency in the future shi et al 2007 is also projected by most cmip6 models regardless of the drought definition this seems beneficial for alleviating the extremely dry condition in this area in the warming world it should also be pointed out that the model projections of future precipitation and other hydrological variables still remain uncertain over many areas including central asia for example there are wet biases in precipitation over northwest china dong and dong 2021 guo et al 2021 therefore it is necessary to carry out more detailed investigations on the likely causes of the changes in multiple hydroclimatic variables through more targeted simulations and predictions credit

7871,study region this study focuses on urban flood modeling in developing cities with a special focus on informal settlements giving a specific case study of mukuru slums in nairobi city of kenya informal settlements refer to unplanned settlements and areas where the housing doesn t comply with the current housing codes and regulations and is thus characterized by a lack of legal settlement and housing plan approvals resulting in poor physical infrastructures and social services urban flood risks have been given less attention compared to rural riverine flooding in developing cities yet they cause more havoc using the appropriate set of models flood modeling in urban settings is critical in integrated flood risk management study focus this study uses a desk review format to promote urban flood modeling knowledge and practice in integrated flood risk management in developing cities in this regard the study presents the review of various flood models highlighting their strengths and weaknesses and the significant role of model calibrations in addressing uncertainties while capturing the local scenarios the paper further presents the role of model stacking where different models are used to understand the same hazard evolution at various scales new hydrological insights for the region as developing cities grow so do the flood risks especially in the informal settlement this study reveals the importance of comprehensively understanding the flood dynamics at various scales the study points out the important role of model stacking and calibrations which allows the understanding of flood risks at various city scales for an integrated city flood risk management keywords hydrologic hydraulic modeling developing cities models uncertainty data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction while flooding is experienced in rural and urban settings its occurrence in the urban setup has a unique nature as the built environment and the growing population plays a significant role in its occurrence besides the predominant causal factor of natural variation in rainfall intensities and durations the effects and the subsequent impacts of flooding are much felt in populated areas such as the urban setups with the worst cases of negative impacts felt in the informal settlements nassar and elsayed 2018 informal settlements refer to unplanned settlements and areas where the housing doesn t comply with the current housing codes and regulations and is thus characterized by a lack of legal settlement and housing plan approvals resulting in poor physical infrastructures and social services these characteristics associated with informal settlements most common in developing cities make them highly vulnerable to flood risks dawson et al 2008 over the years urban flooding has been experienced in cities with devastating impacts in the informal settlements of developing cities and more are to be expected with the rapidly growing informal settlements coupled with climate change impacts in as much as efforts are continually being made to make cities more resilient more is yet to be done to achieve the much desired goal of sustainable and reliant cities especially in developing countries urban flooding is commonly experienced in developing cities leading to the destruction of properties and disruption of services loss of livelihoods and economic disruptions destruction of critical infrastructures and loss of lives these adverse impacts of urban flooding are more pronounced among the urban poor who mostly reside in the informal settlements of developing cities the trend is a concern for developing cities due to the limitations in research economy and policy frameworks and therefore warrants such studies to explore the potential of flood modeling at various levels of the city in an attempt to address the current and potential flood risks in the city and reduce the impacts among the urban poor neal et al 2012 as cities grow both in urbanization and population so does the risk exposure with the sprouting and expansion of informal settlements more than two thirds of the global population is expected to live in urban settings by 2050 with a majority of this urban growth expected in developing cities united nations et al 2019 in as much as the high rate of urbanization and population growth in the developing cities could be a sign of economic growth and progressive urbanization it is also a signal of the high exposure to hazard risks and vulnerabilities to disasters following the low adaptive capacities associated with these cities manifested in the sprouting and growth of the informal settlements coupled with the projected unpredictable rainfall and severe climatic conditions under climate change urban floods are expected to increase in their frequencies and intensities with devastating impacts in the informal settlements if proactive measures are not put in place teng et al 2017a recent studies conducted in narok town revealed that land use and land cover changes directly impact the flood intensities and frequencies in developing cities the increased land use and land cover changes associated with urbanization are thus major contributors to the increasing flood peaks in developing cities umukiza et al 2021 this calls for the adoption of effective integrated flood risk management approaches to effectively address the flood hazard risks at both levels beven and binley 1992 such effective flood risk management practices include planned and controlled integrated land use in cities soil conservation measures agroforestry practices drainage maintenance and sustainable city planning and development as such the best practices of integrated flood management are supported by flood risk modeling to ascertain the previous history of flood hazards understand the current flood risk and predict future possible flood risks under different scenarios bates et al 2005a in as much as this study takes the form of a systematic literature review to explore the various urban flood models applicable in developing cities the study presents the case of nairobi city and showcases the significant role of model calibration and model stacking in understanding the flood dynamics at the city and sub city level informal settlements and thus effectively informing flood risk management at both levels in this study model stacking refers to the process of combining the outputs of multiple model algorithms to enhance the prediction of the model to best capture the local contexts and processes pedersen 2022 the main concept of model stacking where one model outputs are used in the next high precision model to optimize the simulation and prediction of the local phenomenon at the local contexts and process was highly emphasized in this regard this review focuses on some widely used flood models that exist in the current literature and evaluates their capability and suitability to simulate flood hydrodynamics in developing cities the review is timely since advances in flood modeling have evolved rapidly in recent years to be a critical component of flood risk management that need downscaling to the informal settlements to address the current and potential flood risks and the eminent adverse impacts that are more pronounced among the urban poor more specifically the review is done under the broader tomorrow s cities project funded by the uk research and innovation collective fund award to reduce risks from multiple hazards and hence build resilience among the urban poor the study is thus critical because it goes beyond the review of various flood models to showcase the role of model calibration and model stacking application in urban flood modeling to adequately address the city wide and sub city level flood risks using the case of nairobi 2 methodology the study was conducted using a desk review to achieve the study objectives relevant literature was searched reviewed and synthesized in this study pillai 2020 the keywords for the literature search were defined to allow optimal literature search from the different databases and journals the keywords included urban flooding flood modeling uncertainty estimation hydrodynamic models flood risk management model calibration and stacking the literature was searched and retrieved from different databases primarily through google scholar the various journal articles were retrieved mostly from science direct www sciencedirect com and the elsevier journals information portal the literature was limited to those from 1990 onwards to ensure the review of the most recent literature and modeling techniques the gathered literature was integrated with the other literature and information sources such as reports briefs and books known to the author before the review snyder 2019 the systematic review focuses on the flood models exploring their application strengths and limitations how they address the uncertainty issues and the current and future development directions in urban flood modeling and management in this regard the study is organized into four sections the first part presents the introduction outlining the background of urban flood modeling stating the key objectives and justification of the review the second part discusses the methodology used pointing out the limitations of the applied literature review method and the outline of the paper the third section gives the findings thematically grouped to capture the different flood types common in urban areas explore various flood models strengths and the significance of model calibration capturing both uncertainty and sensitivity analysis before presenting the state of flood modeling in nairobi as a case study and highlighting the importance of model stacking in flood modeling the study concludes with the fourth section capturing general conclusions and providing an overview of the study findings and flood modeling applications 3 findings 3 1 urban flood types and risks in developing cities stormwater normally has its natural pathways as they flow through gravity in a specific manner urban floods occur when the storm waters overwhelm the existing drainage systems and are enhanced when the drainage systems are blocked or waterways are diverted okoth et al 2016 anthropogenic processes in urban areas such as land use and land cover changes interfere with the natural stormwater flow and artificial waterways are normally developed to replace or adjust the natural water flows these occur due to the growing urban populations and the competing development needs that tend to alter the land surface and hence the water flows in some cases unplanned and uncontrolled settlements associated with informal settlements in developing cities allow settlement on the flood plains and the waterways thereby increasing the exposure to flooding risks fig 1 fluvial floods normally occur when the streams overflow due to a prolonged rainfall of high intensity ice melt or sea level rise in developing cities such as nairobi fluvial floods are less common but cannot be ruled out since several riverine tributaries meander through the city downstream fluvial flooding usually affects a wide area mostly downstream of a river which tends to be relatively flat and associated with several meanders pluvial flooding the basis of this paper is most common in cities as it is caused by an intense rainfall storm independent of the overflowing of the rivers and streams the developing cities and mostly the informal settlement are the major hotspots of pluvial flooding which pose a threat to the fundamental steps to the achievement of sustainable development goals zscheischler et al 2018 in as much as the increased intensities and frequencies of rainfall is the major causal factor of pluvial floods other causes have been identified in recent past studies dawson et al 2008 identify land use change overwhelmed and in some cases unmaintained urban drainage system and poor urban planning as the causal factors of urban pluvial flooding mark et al 2018 explain pluvial flooding in terms of the scale of its impacts which positively correlates to the large human population and developed assets in the urban settings mark et al 2018 carter and parker 2009 the risks and the impending threats from the urban floods in developing cities are real and worrying due to several reasons first studies focusing on flood risk management show that a few flood hazard modeling studies exist for informal settlements in africa this implies less evidence to support targeted integrated flood risk management in the informal settlements this has led to inadequate informal settlement targeted and evidence based flood risk management measures and policies in most developing cities in cases where they do exist secondly the hydrodynamics of the urban floodwaters undergo a series of interference due to the complex nature of the urban setups and thus pose a significant challenge to parameterizing most of the factors for studies mignot et al 2006 the increasing impervious surfaces of the urban centers reduce the rate of infiltration while increasing the development of surface runoff causing more havoc during floods thirdly various anthropogenic activities such as settling on flood plains and waterways clogging of drainage in the cities diverting of streams and reducing infiltration due to uncontrolled and unplanned constructions enhance the threats of urban pluvial floods fourthly the rapid population growth and high urbanization rates supersede the supply of housing sanitation and other critical infrastructural facilities and services in developing cities leading to the proliferation of informal settlements which enhances the vulnerabilities of the urban dwellers to various disaster risks including flood risks braun and aßheuer 2011 finally the little knowledge of the flood risks impacts and threats in these areas enhance the risk itself as it makes the city more vulnerable and unprepared and thus unable to alleviate the negative impacts of urban flood risks 3 2 flood models classifications since the study involves reviewing various deterministic flood models that have been used in urban flood studies for different purposes including flood forecasting flood hazard mapping simulations and flood risk estimation in this regard the broader categories of flood models in urban flood studies include empirical hydrodynamic and conceptual models 3 2 1 empirical models the empirical models also known as the black box models contain parameters that may have physical characteristics that allow the modeling of input output patterns based on empiricism jun et al 2016 the empirical flood models rely heavily on historical data gathered integrated processed and analyzed and are thus considered accurate and a representation of the observed realities the modeling is considered robust and accurate based on the reflection of the observed realities in the past used as inputs into the model in as much as the modeling technique based on empirical models has gained much research attention continual development and improvement are necessary the outputs of these models are widely used to support decision making and serve as inputs to other methods hlavcova et al 2005 3 2 2 hydrodynamic models hydrodynamic models are those based on fluid dynamics where the computations of waves and fluids motion are the basis of simulation the models simulate water movement by solving fluid equations based on physical laws depending on the spatial dimension representation of the fluid flow the hydrodynamic models can be classified as dimensional two dimensional and three dimensional flood models bates et al 2005b 3 2 2 1 dimensional models one dimensional flood models represent the channel and floodplain as a series of cross sections perpendicular to the flow direction and solve the one dimensional shallow water equations bates and roo 2000 several hydraulic situations may apply the one dimensional hydrodynamic modeling when the solution doesn t require knowledge of the other dimensions they are the simplest of all hydrodynamic models computationally efficient since the flow is assumed to be in one direction steady and at a homogenous velocity across the flow channels bates and roo 2000 the application of 1d flood models in urban areas may overlook the significant hydrological and hydraulic characteristics that define urban floods needed to be parameterized in model simulations and predictions for effective decision making horritt and bates 2002 dimension flood models are derived by solving mass and momentum conservation equations between two cross sections δx apart yielding the famous one dimensional saint venant equations 1 conservation of mass q x a t 0 2 conservation of momentum 1 a q t 1 a q 2 a x g h x g s 0 s f 0 where q is the flow discharge a is the flow cross section area t is the time h represents water depth is the gravitational acceleration s f is the friction slope and so is the channel bed slope while the one dimensional hydrodynamic model has the merit of low input data requirements they have the broader limitations of misrepresenting critical hydrological processes ali et al 2015 several efforts are continually being made to enhance the performance of these models especially in simulating urban floods and thus one dimensional models may not adequately simulate urban floods in developing cities where the micro features play a central role in riverine and flash floods for instance mark et al 2004 study of urban floods using a one dimensional model reveals that while flood modeling is possible using the one dimensional models there exist uncertainties in the model outputs due to the treatment of topography data and urban flow characteristics as one dimension 3 2 2 2 two dimensional models generally the 2 d models represent the floodplain flow by considering two dimension fields assuming the third field which is usually water depth is shallow and thus assumed in solving the two dimension shallow water equations nkwunonwo et al 2020 the two dimensional flood models such as tutflow and mike 21 solve the two dimensional swes using appropriate numerical schemes in other words the models solve the 2d shallow water equation which is a representation of mass and momentum conservation in a plane mode and depth averaging of the navier stokes s equation 3 conservation of mass h t hu x hv y 0 4 conservation of momentum hu t x hu 2 1 2 gh 2 huv y 0 5 hv t huv x y hv 2 1 2 gh 2 0 where x and y represent the two spatial dimensions and the u v are 2d vectors representing the horizontal average velocity of the flow the solution of these equations gives estimates of horizontal velocity and depth of the flow it is evident that 2d hydrodynamic models are the most widely used in flood mapping and assessment studies and thus widely documented several scholars have also reviewed the capability of 2d models in flood modeling for example hunter et al 2008 comprehensively review the performance of several 2d models in capturing urban flood hydrodynamics neelz and pender 2010 further reviewed by benchmarking of 2ddraulic modelling packages and found out that while the urban areas present more localized simulation challenges in flood modeling the 2d models significantly capture dynamics of flows and are thus effective in flood modeling studies hunter et al 2008 a major advantage of the two dimensional flood models is the comprehensive representation of flow hydrodynamics along with small scale topographic features which seem to have significant contributions to urban flooding two dimensional flood models are increasingly being applied in the prediction of the flood of all sources and so account for the optimal performance achieved in flood modeling although the lack of rigorous model calibration still constrains the application of these models in developing cities xing et al 2019 3 2 2 3 three dimensional models in as much as it seems complex and at times unnecessary since the 2d representation may be adequate to simulate and predict flow dynamics of various scales the 3d modeling allows modeling of vortices vertical turbulence and multiple spirals flow at various bends and thus critical in understanding catastrophic flooding emanating from dam outbreaks flash floods tsunamis among others overall the 2d hydrodynamic models were developed to capture vertical features of flows while some 3d models solve the horizontal flow with 2d swe and include a quasi 3d extension to model velocity in vertical layers others are derived from the 3d navier stokes equations describing fluid flow and are normally written as 6 conservation of momentum u t u u 1 ρ p g μ u 7 incompressibility condition u 0 where u is the flow velocity ρ is the fluid density p is the fluid pressure g is the gravitational acceleration and μ is the kinematic viscosity eq 6 is based on the application of newton s equation f ma to fluid motion and eq 7 is based on the fact that the fluid density is constant within a fluid parcel teng et al 2017b depending on the nature of the representation of the process the models can further be classified into eulerian grid based or lagrangian particle based the uses of 3d flood models had been considered not viable for flood inundation reaching above one kilometer due to lack of computational capabilities inaccuracy in representing free surface flows and high order turbulence cleary et al 2007 however this limitation has eased in the recent past following the development of high computing techniques and the development of particle based modeling techniques the particle based modeling techniques allow the representation of micro scale features and units smaller than grid cells thus eliminating spatial diffusion need problems for spatial discretion cleary and prakash 2004 nevertheless the use of 3d modeling in flood inundation is recent and thus limited literature is currently available compared to 2d flood inundation modeling 3 2 3 simplified conceptual models these are models that don t simulate the physical processes associated with fluid flow and inundation but are majorly concentrated in simplified hydraulic concepts as much as they may fit within the two dimensional classification due to their dimensional representation of flows they are not hydrodynamic models these models solve the simplified shallow water equation by omitting one or two acceleration terms neelz and pender 2013 a good example of the non physics based models is the rapid flood spreading method which works by basically segmenting the flood plain according to topographic depressions and then spreading the flood volume by filling these depressions progressively according to the elevation and size lhomme et al 2008 this conceptual methodology also forms the basis of the flood modeler pro 2d fast solver these models can be used to predict final inundation within a short time since they require less computational capacity need compared to hydrodynamic models hlavcova et al 2005 mark et al 2004 other sets of conceptual models are based on the theory of the planar method where the flood extent is derived by the model intersecting several fine resolution plains using high resolution digital elevation models and directly linking water volumes with flood extents teng et al 2015 other models such as the height above the nearest drainage hand model work by normalizing the topography of the area of interest relative to the local heights of the nearby stream and estimating the flood inundation by selecting the cells whose model simulation values are less than the known long term water depth in the nearby stream nobre et al 2011 more generally conceptual models require less intense computational demands and are thus useful tools in large scale applications where the flood extents and depths are the only required outputs as dynamic effects are assumed to be insignificant 3 3 strengths and limitations of flood models different modeling techniques have their advantages and limitations specific models also have their strengths and limitation in this paper the strengths and limitations of models are analyzed in two stages to capture the general classification or categories as well as the specific models 3 3 1 analysis by models classification the overall strengths and limitations of the broader modeling categories and their suitability for the various flood studies are summarized in table 1 and discussed below 3 3 1 1 empirical models these models are perhaps the most instinctive and straightforward tools to understand flooding characteristics based on records and related input data they are normally assumed to be accurate since flood events have a certain history cycle of occurrence however the accuracy is highly dependent on the acquisition and processing methods adopted for the flood modeling and therefore high accuracy demand more costly acquisition processes and complex processing techniques for the input data the models are largely dependent on the wisdom of hindsight since they are a snapshot of the past and are thus limited in capturing the possible response to possible future scenarios or changes the limitation of the spatial and temporal coarseness of resolution of the outputs was common but these are improving with the use of remote sensing in data gathering other possible limitations of the methods and models include engineering faults associated with sensor design operations and transmission environmental drawbacks such as adverse weather conditions and other natural factors and the accuracy of the algorithms in data mining and processing imply the output information since these models are purely adopting the input output approach based on records any artificial error in the entire chain of processes can jeopardize the credibility of the resulting outputs and the decision making information being shared 3 3 1 2 hydrodynamic models these models are widely used tools in detailed flood dynamics simulations and are mostly linked to flood forecasting mapping and scenario analysis both in research and operations the critical characteristics of hydrodynamic models that perhaps explain their widespread usage in various applications are the ability to manipulate their inputs to investigate the impacts of changes in the initial conditions boundary conditions and topographic changes arising from the change in critical hydrodynamic features such as river streams culverts and stream channel volume the 1d hydrodynamics are usually computationally efficient since they consider flows in one direction and assume their steady and uniform however they have several limitations which include the inability to capture lateral and vertical wave diffusions of the flood waves considering topography as cross sections rather than the continuous surface and thus somehow subjective in factoring in orientation and topographical cross sections horritt and bates 2002 the 2d hydrodynamics generally can accurately simulate inundation timings and durations and are thus commonly used in different applications however they are computationally intensive especially when covering a large study area since they solve the full shallow water equation neelz and pender 2010 the 3d hydrodynamic models are generally considered not viable when covering an area of more than 1000 square kilometers especially when a high resolution simulation is required they are computationally intensive and may take prohibitively long and thus not reliable for quick forecasts that give enough lead time for interventions beven and binley 1992 3 3 1 3 simplified conceptual models these models require less computational capability than the hydrodynamic models they are relatively fast and robust and are most suited for applications that don t require flow velocity outputs and low demands in flow dynamics accuracy and representations teng et al 2017c the less computational requirement implies that conceptual models have a high runtime saving and are thus suitable for a large flood plain simulation and probabilistic risk assessment that demands multiple and large number simulations the models simulate flood extents water depths and overbank volumes much well on flood plains with clear flow paths but get more complicated in areas with complex topographies where momentum conservation is a significant factor overall conceptual models have no representation of flow dynamics or force fields don t capture wave dynamics and thus don t predict flow velocities lhomme et al 2008 the application of conceptual models is thus limited to areas of application where the flow dynamics effects are less significant in determining the direction and inundation characteristics table 2 overall the study reveals that most flood models can be applied in urban flood studies irrespective of their classification however each and specific model has its strengths and weaknesses that must be considered in every study and application as their objectives vary the strengths of hydrodynamic models allow their application in informal settlements where the land use changes are dynamic and the complexities of socio economic factors come to play wamuchiru 2012 the resolutions of the data inputs and the driving hydrological and hydrodynamics equations also determined the extent of the localized flood modeling in informal settlements to best address flood hazard risks in informal settlements the application of hydrological models that not only captures the rainfall runs off phenomenon but also allow the simulation and prediction of the flood movements and spread the existing and potential hydraulic systems and allows possible scenarios development based on the land use and land cover changes among other socio economic inputs one of the major challenges of flood hazard modeling and forecasting in informal settlements is the availability of reliable high resolution input data that need to be addressed in various developing cities neal et al 2012 however there exist various gridded reliable data sets that are continually bridging the gap moreover the flooding in most informal settlements usually manifests as part of a sub catchment whose characteristics provide some clue on the hydro climatic patterns in the area of interest since models are as good as the input data and the driving equations with their limitations the review calls for a proper choice of flood model for informal settlement flood studies and encourages their localization through calibration and validation processes using local ground truth data for valid and reliable outputs 3 4 the role of model calibration in flood modelling all flood models have their strengths and limitations regardless of their dimensionality complexity and mathematical frameworks in this regard it is nearly impossible to have a perfect model to solely simulate the natural hydrodynamic processes and thus flooding in urban areas teng et al 2017b these complexities of simulating urban floods become more evident in developing cities where the microenvironment land physical processes contribute significantly to the urban flood dynamics and thus need to be well captured in the model simulations de oliveira et al 2019 flood modeling however remains the core and perhaps the future of effective integrated flood risk management and thus the focus is on how best to use and improve the flood models and modeling processes especially in developing cities where the impacts of floods are most pronounced reynolds et al 2020 this study reveals that the calibration of the existing state of the art flood models allows contextualization and parameterization using the local and context specific input datasets and thus allows flood modeling in developing cities bout and jetten 2018 model calibration is therefore a significant process that allows the application of the existing flood models in developing cities however the discussions around model calibration always point to the concepts of uncertainties that must be determined and incorporated into the modeling process to ensure the results are sensible enough for the area of study dottori et al 2013 uncertainties in flood modeling may arise from the input data methodology or even the theory underpinning the specific modeling framework and these may undermine the accuracy and reliability of the research and flood risk management efforts o brien and zhao 2012 knijff et al 2010 uncertainties in flood models may contribute to the under or over estimation of the flood phenomenon and characteristics making the outputs unrealistic and thus misinforming the subsequent decisions koks et al 2015 flood model calibration therefore tends to play a critical role in addressing the model uncertainties to localize the model and thus make the model outputs more realistic allowing their application in developing cities uncertainties which are the possible unknown forcing in the modeling process are the motivation behind model calibration to enhance reliability and integrity uncertainties usually contribute significantly to the variation between the model predictions and the observed realities of the phenomenon liu et al 2009 in flood modeling the estimation of the uncertainties is critical to understand how and to what magnitude they cause variations between the model prediction and the observed realities as applied in different geographical areas in this regard uncertainties in flood modeling vary from one application to another depending on the input data the model being used and the area of study todini 2007 in as much as the sources of uncertainties in flood modeling may stem from the model design itself and the input data their estimation and communication instigate some confidence when using the model outputs in critical decision making and thus promote proactive strategies developments in flood risk management in as much as model calibrations seek to address the challenges of uncertainties the significance is to know to what extent a particular model can be applied and yield real results in a particular geographical location within the local contexts of scale and data availability todini 2007 in this case if a model is to be applied in a developing city the model is calibrated using the locally available data within the uncertainty boundaries to reach the optimal goodness of fit to best and convincingly capture the local context bales and wagner 2009 in the past few decades flood modeling literature has been discussing flood inundation model calibration and argues that most models haven t reached the optimal calibration limit this is partly due to the limited availability of appropriate and reliable calibration data especially in developing cities however the progress in remote sensing data availability is allowing some advancement in flood model calibrations and thus their applications in developing cities merwade et al 2008 while model calibration is aimed at reducing uncertainties a sensitivity analysis that aims at assessing the robustness of the model under various assumptions is also highly recommended while uncertainty analysis tends to address the impacts of the unknown in the model outputs sensitivity analysis focuses more on the effects of the known inputs on the model predictions aronica et al 1998 in this regard sensitivity analysis points out the factors that significantly influence the model outputs those that need further investigation and those factors that present a null influence on the outputs weichel et al 2007 sensitivity analysis therefore assists in understanding the sensitivity of the model outputs to the various input variable and factors despite its relevance in flood modeling few studies have been conducted in developing cities and more is yet to be done in informal settlements while there are questions on the existence and the choice of uncertainty and sensitivity analysis procedure that suits the complexity of flood modeling in developing cities several methodologies have been reported in various hydrological and flood modeling literature koks et al 2015 dottori et al 2013 methodologies such as the bayesian uncertainty estimation linear regression analysis and the monte carlo simulations which are based on statistical and mathematical modeling have been used widely in uncertainty and sensitivity analysis of flood models hall et al 2005 2009 while the choice of the methodologies can be determined by empirical and economic factors the bottom line focus on the optimization of the model performance to best inform flood risk management and therefore the uncertainty and sensitivity analysis play a critical role in flood modeling to evaluate the model behaviors and performance as applied in developing cities liu et al 2009 bales and wagner 2009 3 5 flood modelling the case of nairobi 3 5 1 flood risk among the nairobi urban poor nairobi is the capital city of kenya and about 60 of urban residents are estimated to live in informal settlements flooding is a major problem in the city especially in the informal settlements characterized by high poverty levels unplanned settlements poor infrastructures such as drainage networks and poor basic services thus the exposure and vulnerability to flooding risks are high dawson et al 2018 the rapid population increase in the city and the informal settlements have increased by homes built in riparian lands exposing residents to higher flood risk for example in kibera slums more than 22 000 residents live along the river banks of ngong river meandering the city and more than 50 confirm their homes have been flooded in the recent past since 2015 mulligan et al 2019 it can be confirmed that floods are nowadays experienced in areas where the occurrence was rather infrequent two decades ago in the city the flood risk in the nairobi informal settlement where a majority of the urban poor dwell is thus eminent to be addressed for the sustainable development of the city wamuchiru 2012 while city flooding is commonly reported the impacts are differently felt with the worst hit being the informal settlement and the urban poor this is a clear demonstration of the underlying drivers of flood risk vulnerabilities among the urban poor the continuous and rapid change in the land use and land cover due to urbanization has partly contributed to the increased runoff contributing to the city flooding despite the evident flood risks in nairobi and the eminent role flood modeling plays in integrated flood risk management this review has established that most studies on floods in nairobi have been focusing on vulnerability and risk perception in parts of the city and less on flood modeling besides most flood studies have been in the past concentrated in the rural areas where riverine flooding has been known to cover a vast area and impacts are closely monitored and recorded 3 5 2 flood modeling studies were done in nairobi a few studies in nairobi have been conducted focusing on flood modeling and this is a demonstration that flood models can be applied to simulate the city s flooding characteristics a study conducted by muli investigated flood modeling in nairobi based on the city hydrological processes considering the impacts of rapid urban development muli 2011 the study saw the setting up and calibration of the hec hms model using the available climate and river flow data for nairobi city as a watershed the study revealed that the city had a 55 imperviousness then and the increased imperviousness due to increased pavements buildings and roads reduces the soil conservation service lag time and the watershed runoff increases the correlation between the observed and model simulated run off yielded a coefficient of the determinant of 0 82 revealing the model significantly captured the city hydrodynamics the study also considered different scenarios and revealed that nairobi city had a 43 chance of flooding after every 2 33 years muli 2011 the impact of an increased imperviousness from 55 to 60 due to rapid infrastructural developments was an increased mean annual flow from 50 m3 s to 345 m3 s which is a 600 increment that the existing drainage networks cannot sustain this revealed a high risk of flooding if the drainage networks are not matched to the increased imperviousness of the city okoth and colleagues 2016 conducted a study on integrated urban pluvial flooding analysis and modeling for nairobi west and south c areas in nairobi in this study the increased risks of pluvial flooding are reiterated due to the rapid urbanization characterized by urban densification inadequate city drainage network and continually changing urban hydrology okoth et al 2016 the study employed the use of the storm water management model version 5 1 using the available gis data rainfall river flow and sewer network data the study reveals that significant flooding of 20 134 ha m surface runoff yields about 81 of sewer system surcharging in the city a sensitivity analysis of the model shows that the peak runoff significantly responds to variations in imperviousness parameters the study concludes that the swmm5 1 model can be applied in simulating urban pluvial flooding and contribute to stormwater and flood management in nairobi hall et al 2005 2009 urban flood modeling in most cases is thought of as an analytical process purely focusing on the empirical inputs and physical processes mulligan and colleagues mulligan et al 2019 conducted a study where participatory flood modeling for negotiation and planning in the urban informal settlement of kibera in nairobi while acknowledging the role of analytical methods and hydrological models in flood risk management the study emphasizes the role of wider stakeholder engagement and contributions in urban flood management especially in informal settlements the study develops a new case based knowledge to inform the application of participatory modeling and planning for informal urban areas the study uses the newly established framework for the classification of participatory modeling approaches developed by basco carrera and colleagues basco carrera et al 2017 and concludes that there are high chances of developing implementable plans and policies for flood risk management when wider stakeholders including those upstream are involved there are indications that more flood models are possibly being applied in nairobi under different ongoing research projects and are yet to be published more generally various studies on urban flooding have focused on the vulnerability exposure and impacts from the social perspectives and only a few on flood modeling this review therefore points out the gap in flood modeling as a tool in flood risk management in nairobi especially in informal settlements 3 5 3 the role of flood model stacking in understanding city wide and sub city flood risks mukuru informal settlement in nairobi city covers almost 650 acres and is home to at least 300 000 people who continually face the risk of urban floods the kenyan government has recently adopted the special planning area spa model of slum upgrading where mukuru was identified as the first spa in 2017 horn 2021 the model allows coordinated and integrated infrastructural development while improving the service delivery to the residents tomorrow s city has been working with the local authorities and partners to promote risk knowledge in the planning and implementation of the spa in mukuru in this regard there is a need to understand the flood risks in the spa and integrate this knowledge into the mitigation strategies for a sustainable city douglas et al 2008 flood modeling that captures the local characteristics at the sub city level is thus critical however the flooding in the informal settlement of mukuru in nairobi doesn t solely come from the local area the city wide activities drainage network rainfall and settlements among others could be contributing to the flooding in mukuru spa this calls for the city wide flood dynamics understanding before narrowing it down to the flood dynamics and the underlying vulnerabilities that enhance the flood risks in mukuru slums model stacking is an efficient ensemble method in which the predictions generated by using a specific or more model algorithm are used as inputs in the second layer of algorithms this framework can be applied in flood modeling in the informal settlement to better integrated flood risk management zounemat kermani et al 2021 for instance the tomorrows cities research project in nairobi explores the integration of physical science modeling social science understanding and community participation in flood risk management in the implementation of the mukuru spa from this review and application of the framework of model stacking a combination of flood models has been identified to be applied to achieve the project objectives concerning flood modeling the soil and water accounting tool swat will be used to understand the flood dynamics at the city level using the topographical climatic soil and river discharge data kim et al 2016 the outputs of the model will allow the estimation of floods reaching mukuru informal settlements from elsewhere in the city the hydrologic engineering center s river analysis system hec ras 2d model will be used to simulate the flood characteristics within the mukuru spa the combination of the two models at various stages all aim at comprehensively understanding the flood hazard risks in the city and the informal settlement to inform the participatory approach of the spa model in upgrading the slum towards a sustainable city rangari et al 2019 the local flood characteristics in the informal settlement require a model that can effectively capture the hydraulic networks and the stream geometry while integrating the vulnerability aspects at the local level 4 conclusion while flood modeling is a crucial tool to support effective integrated flood risk management developing cities and thus informal settlements struggle with their applications due to limited high resolution accurate and consistent input data for model calibration flood impacts in developing cities which are mostly domiciled in the developing states are most pronounced in the informal settlement and thus the application of flood modeling is a critical component of integrated flood risk management this practice requires both city wide and sub city flood modeling and thus the paper points out the model stacking framework as a method and proposes practices such as nature based solutions in flood risk management in developing cities ferreira et al 2021 flood modeling requires very crucial hydraulic flood inundation data among other data sets which are either unavailable inconsistent inaccurate or inaccessible in most informal settlements of developing cities this trend poses a challenge and perhaps explains partially the limited number of studies in flood modeling in developing cities and more so in informal settlements however the urgency to address the prevailing urban flood risks in developing cities supersedes the existing gaps and thus spontaneous studies involving the application of flood models have been conducted the advancement in remote sense data coupled with the available although limited ground observed data allows the calibration and application of flood models in developing cities and the informal settlement to inform flood risk management the review therefore concludes that the application of flood modeling in developing cities and informal settlements is possible but requires effective model calibration using the local data to capture the local flow realities and processes model stacking to understand the city wide flood dynamics and advocates for participatory and inclusive practices to address the local vulnerabilities associated with flood risks flood modeling is thus an essential technique for ineffective integrated flood risk management in developing cities and informal settlements the study also suggests further studies in exploring the performance of the different models in various cities with different contexts and focusing on integrated flood risk management this is because what works for one context may not necessarily work for another informal settlement in developing cities with the continued impacts of climate change

7871,study region this study focuses on urban flood modeling in developing cities with a special focus on informal settlements giving a specific case study of mukuru slums in nairobi city of kenya informal settlements refer to unplanned settlements and areas where the housing doesn t comply with the current housing codes and regulations and is thus characterized by a lack of legal settlement and housing plan approvals resulting in poor physical infrastructures and social services urban flood risks have been given less attention compared to rural riverine flooding in developing cities yet they cause more havoc using the appropriate set of models flood modeling in urban settings is critical in integrated flood risk management study focus this study uses a desk review format to promote urban flood modeling knowledge and practice in integrated flood risk management in developing cities in this regard the study presents the review of various flood models highlighting their strengths and weaknesses and the significant role of model calibrations in addressing uncertainties while capturing the local scenarios the paper further presents the role of model stacking where different models are used to understand the same hazard evolution at various scales new hydrological insights for the region as developing cities grow so do the flood risks especially in the informal settlement this study reveals the importance of comprehensively understanding the flood dynamics at various scales the study points out the important role of model stacking and calibrations which allows the understanding of flood risks at various city scales for an integrated city flood risk management keywords hydrologic hydraulic modeling developing cities models uncertainty data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction while flooding is experienced in rural and urban settings its occurrence in the urban setup has a unique nature as the built environment and the growing population plays a significant role in its occurrence besides the predominant causal factor of natural variation in rainfall intensities and durations the effects and the subsequent impacts of flooding are much felt in populated areas such as the urban setups with the worst cases of negative impacts felt in the informal settlements nassar and elsayed 2018 informal settlements refer to unplanned settlements and areas where the housing doesn t comply with the current housing codes and regulations and is thus characterized by a lack of legal settlement and housing plan approvals resulting in poor physical infrastructures and social services these characteristics associated with informal settlements most common in developing cities make them highly vulnerable to flood risks dawson et al 2008 over the years urban flooding has been experienced in cities with devastating impacts in the informal settlements of developing cities and more are to be expected with the rapidly growing informal settlements coupled with climate change impacts in as much as efforts are continually being made to make cities more resilient more is yet to be done to achieve the much desired goal of sustainable and reliant cities especially in developing countries urban flooding is commonly experienced in developing cities leading to the destruction of properties and disruption of services loss of livelihoods and economic disruptions destruction of critical infrastructures and loss of lives these adverse impacts of urban flooding are more pronounced among the urban poor who mostly reside in the informal settlements of developing cities the trend is a concern for developing cities due to the limitations in research economy and policy frameworks and therefore warrants such studies to explore the potential of flood modeling at various levels of the city in an attempt to address the current and potential flood risks in the city and reduce the impacts among the urban poor neal et al 2012 as cities grow both in urbanization and population so does the risk exposure with the sprouting and expansion of informal settlements more than two thirds of the global population is expected to live in urban settings by 2050 with a majority of this urban growth expected in developing cities united nations et al 2019 in as much as the high rate of urbanization and population growth in the developing cities could be a sign of economic growth and progressive urbanization it is also a signal of the high exposure to hazard risks and vulnerabilities to disasters following the low adaptive capacities associated with these cities manifested in the sprouting and growth of the informal settlements coupled with the projected unpredictable rainfall and severe climatic conditions under climate change urban floods are expected to increase in their frequencies and intensities with devastating impacts in the informal settlements if proactive measures are not put in place teng et al 2017a recent studies conducted in narok town revealed that land use and land cover changes directly impact the flood intensities and frequencies in developing cities the increased land use and land cover changes associated with urbanization are thus major contributors to the increasing flood peaks in developing cities umukiza et al 2021 this calls for the adoption of effective integrated flood risk management approaches to effectively address the flood hazard risks at both levels beven and binley 1992 such effective flood risk management practices include planned and controlled integrated land use in cities soil conservation measures agroforestry practices drainage maintenance and sustainable city planning and development as such the best practices of integrated flood management are supported by flood risk modeling to ascertain the previous history of flood hazards understand the current flood risk and predict future possible flood risks under different scenarios bates et al 2005a in as much as this study takes the form of a systematic literature review to explore the various urban flood models applicable in developing cities the study presents the case of nairobi city and showcases the significant role of model calibration and model stacking in understanding the flood dynamics at the city and sub city level informal settlements and thus effectively informing flood risk management at both levels in this study model stacking refers to the process of combining the outputs of multiple model algorithms to enhance the prediction of the model to best capture the local contexts and processes pedersen 2022 the main concept of model stacking where one model outputs are used in the next high precision model to optimize the simulation and prediction of the local phenomenon at the local contexts and process was highly emphasized in this regard this review focuses on some widely used flood models that exist in the current literature and evaluates their capability and suitability to simulate flood hydrodynamics in developing cities the review is timely since advances in flood modeling have evolved rapidly in recent years to be a critical component of flood risk management that need downscaling to the informal settlements to address the current and potential flood risks and the eminent adverse impacts that are more pronounced among the urban poor more specifically the review is done under the broader tomorrow s cities project funded by the uk research and innovation collective fund award to reduce risks from multiple hazards and hence build resilience among the urban poor the study is thus critical because it goes beyond the review of various flood models to showcase the role of model calibration and model stacking application in urban flood modeling to adequately address the city wide and sub city level flood risks using the case of nairobi 2 methodology the study was conducted using a desk review to achieve the study objectives relevant literature was searched reviewed and synthesized in this study pillai 2020 the keywords for the literature search were defined to allow optimal literature search from the different databases and journals the keywords included urban flooding flood modeling uncertainty estimation hydrodynamic models flood risk management model calibration and stacking the literature was searched and retrieved from different databases primarily through google scholar the various journal articles were retrieved mostly from science direct www sciencedirect com and the elsevier journals information portal the literature was limited to those from 1990 onwards to ensure the review of the most recent literature and modeling techniques the gathered literature was integrated with the other literature and information sources such as reports briefs and books known to the author before the review snyder 2019 the systematic review focuses on the flood models exploring their application strengths and limitations how they address the uncertainty issues and the current and future development directions in urban flood modeling and management in this regard the study is organized into four sections the first part presents the introduction outlining the background of urban flood modeling stating the key objectives and justification of the review the second part discusses the methodology used pointing out the limitations of the applied literature review method and the outline of the paper the third section gives the findings thematically grouped to capture the different flood types common in urban areas explore various flood models strengths and the significance of model calibration capturing both uncertainty and sensitivity analysis before presenting the state of flood modeling in nairobi as a case study and highlighting the importance of model stacking in flood modeling the study concludes with the fourth section capturing general conclusions and providing an overview of the study findings and flood modeling applications 3 findings 3 1 urban flood types and risks in developing cities stormwater normally has its natural pathways as they flow through gravity in a specific manner urban floods occur when the storm waters overwhelm the existing drainage systems and are enhanced when the drainage systems are blocked or waterways are diverted okoth et al 2016 anthropogenic processes in urban areas such as land use and land cover changes interfere with the natural stormwater flow and artificial waterways are normally developed to replace or adjust the natural water flows these occur due to the growing urban populations and the competing development needs that tend to alter the land surface and hence the water flows in some cases unplanned and uncontrolled settlements associated with informal settlements in developing cities allow settlement on the flood plains and the waterways thereby increasing the exposure to flooding risks fig 1 fluvial floods normally occur when the streams overflow due to a prolonged rainfall of high intensity ice melt or sea level rise in developing cities such as nairobi fluvial floods are less common but cannot be ruled out since several riverine tributaries meander through the city downstream fluvial flooding usually affects a wide area mostly downstream of a river which tends to be relatively flat and associated with several meanders pluvial flooding the basis of this paper is most common in cities as it is caused by an intense rainfall storm independent of the overflowing of the rivers and streams the developing cities and mostly the informal settlement are the major hotspots of pluvial flooding which pose a threat to the fundamental steps to the achievement of sustainable development goals zscheischler et al 2018 in as much as the increased intensities and frequencies of rainfall is the major causal factor of pluvial floods other causes have been identified in recent past studies dawson et al 2008 identify land use change overwhelmed and in some cases unmaintained urban drainage system and poor urban planning as the causal factors of urban pluvial flooding mark et al 2018 explain pluvial flooding in terms of the scale of its impacts which positively correlates to the large human population and developed assets in the urban settings mark et al 2018 carter and parker 2009 the risks and the impending threats from the urban floods in developing cities are real and worrying due to several reasons first studies focusing on flood risk management show that a few flood hazard modeling studies exist for informal settlements in africa this implies less evidence to support targeted integrated flood risk management in the informal settlements this has led to inadequate informal settlement targeted and evidence based flood risk management measures and policies in most developing cities in cases where they do exist secondly the hydrodynamics of the urban floodwaters undergo a series of interference due to the complex nature of the urban setups and thus pose a significant challenge to parameterizing most of the factors for studies mignot et al 2006 the increasing impervious surfaces of the urban centers reduce the rate of infiltration while increasing the development of surface runoff causing more havoc during floods thirdly various anthropogenic activities such as settling on flood plains and waterways clogging of drainage in the cities diverting of streams and reducing infiltration due to uncontrolled and unplanned constructions enhance the threats of urban pluvial floods fourthly the rapid population growth and high urbanization rates supersede the supply of housing sanitation and other critical infrastructural facilities and services in developing cities leading to the proliferation of informal settlements which enhances the vulnerabilities of the urban dwellers to various disaster risks including flood risks braun and aßheuer 2011 finally the little knowledge of the flood risks impacts and threats in these areas enhance the risk itself as it makes the city more vulnerable and unprepared and thus unable to alleviate the negative impacts of urban flood risks 3 2 flood models classifications since the study involves reviewing various deterministic flood models that have been used in urban flood studies for different purposes including flood forecasting flood hazard mapping simulations and flood risk estimation in this regard the broader categories of flood models in urban flood studies include empirical hydrodynamic and conceptual models 3 2 1 empirical models the empirical models also known as the black box models contain parameters that may have physical characteristics that allow the modeling of input output patterns based on empiricism jun et al 2016 the empirical flood models rely heavily on historical data gathered integrated processed and analyzed and are thus considered accurate and a representation of the observed realities the modeling is considered robust and accurate based on the reflection of the observed realities in the past used as inputs into the model in as much as the modeling technique based on empirical models has gained much research attention continual development and improvement are necessary the outputs of these models are widely used to support decision making and serve as inputs to other methods hlavcova et al 2005 3 2 2 hydrodynamic models hydrodynamic models are those based on fluid dynamics where the computations of waves and fluids motion are the basis of simulation the models simulate water movement by solving fluid equations based on physical laws depending on the spatial dimension representation of the fluid flow the hydrodynamic models can be classified as dimensional two dimensional and three dimensional flood models bates et al 2005b 3 2 2 1 dimensional models one dimensional flood models represent the channel and floodplain as a series of cross sections perpendicular to the flow direction and solve the one dimensional shallow water equations bates and roo 2000 several hydraulic situations may apply the one dimensional hydrodynamic modeling when the solution doesn t require knowledge of the other dimensions they are the simplest of all hydrodynamic models computationally efficient since the flow is assumed to be in one direction steady and at a homogenous velocity across the flow channels bates and roo 2000 the application of 1d flood models in urban areas may overlook the significant hydrological and hydraulic characteristics that define urban floods needed to be parameterized in model simulations and predictions for effective decision making horritt and bates 2002 dimension flood models are derived by solving mass and momentum conservation equations between two cross sections δx apart yielding the famous one dimensional saint venant equations 1 conservation of mass q x a t 0 2 conservation of momentum 1 a q t 1 a q 2 a x g h x g s 0 s f 0 where q is the flow discharge a is the flow cross section area t is the time h represents water depth is the gravitational acceleration s f is the friction slope and so is the channel bed slope while the one dimensional hydrodynamic model has the merit of low input data requirements they have the broader limitations of misrepresenting critical hydrological processes ali et al 2015 several efforts are continually being made to enhance the performance of these models especially in simulating urban floods and thus one dimensional models may not adequately simulate urban floods in developing cities where the micro features play a central role in riverine and flash floods for instance mark et al 2004 study of urban floods using a one dimensional model reveals that while flood modeling is possible using the one dimensional models there exist uncertainties in the model outputs due to the treatment of topography data and urban flow characteristics as one dimension 3 2 2 2 two dimensional models generally the 2 d models represent the floodplain flow by considering two dimension fields assuming the third field which is usually water depth is shallow and thus assumed in solving the two dimension shallow water equations nkwunonwo et al 2020 the two dimensional flood models such as tutflow and mike 21 solve the two dimensional swes using appropriate numerical schemes in other words the models solve the 2d shallow water equation which is a representation of mass and momentum conservation in a plane mode and depth averaging of the navier stokes s equation 3 conservation of mass h t hu x hv y 0 4 conservation of momentum hu t x hu 2 1 2 gh 2 huv y 0 5 hv t huv x y hv 2 1 2 gh 2 0 where x and y represent the two spatial dimensions and the u v are 2d vectors representing the horizontal average velocity of the flow the solution of these equations gives estimates of horizontal velocity and depth of the flow it is evident that 2d hydrodynamic models are the most widely used in flood mapping and assessment studies and thus widely documented several scholars have also reviewed the capability of 2d models in flood modeling for example hunter et al 2008 comprehensively review the performance of several 2d models in capturing urban flood hydrodynamics neelz and pender 2010 further reviewed by benchmarking of 2ddraulic modelling packages and found out that while the urban areas present more localized simulation challenges in flood modeling the 2d models significantly capture dynamics of flows and are thus effective in flood modeling studies hunter et al 2008 a major advantage of the two dimensional flood models is the comprehensive representation of flow hydrodynamics along with small scale topographic features which seem to have significant contributions to urban flooding two dimensional flood models are increasingly being applied in the prediction of the flood of all sources and so account for the optimal performance achieved in flood modeling although the lack of rigorous model calibration still constrains the application of these models in developing cities xing et al 2019 3 2 2 3 three dimensional models in as much as it seems complex and at times unnecessary since the 2d representation may be adequate to simulate and predict flow dynamics of various scales the 3d modeling allows modeling of vortices vertical turbulence and multiple spirals flow at various bends and thus critical in understanding catastrophic flooding emanating from dam outbreaks flash floods tsunamis among others overall the 2d hydrodynamic models were developed to capture vertical features of flows while some 3d models solve the horizontal flow with 2d swe and include a quasi 3d extension to model velocity in vertical layers others are derived from the 3d navier stokes equations describing fluid flow and are normally written as 6 conservation of momentum u t u u 1 ρ p g μ u 7 incompressibility condition u 0 where u is the flow velocity ρ is the fluid density p is the fluid pressure g is the gravitational acceleration and μ is the kinematic viscosity eq 6 is based on the application of newton s equation f ma to fluid motion and eq 7 is based on the fact that the fluid density is constant within a fluid parcel teng et al 2017b depending on the nature of the representation of the process the models can further be classified into eulerian grid based or lagrangian particle based the uses of 3d flood models had been considered not viable for flood inundation reaching above one kilometer due to lack of computational capabilities inaccuracy in representing free surface flows and high order turbulence cleary et al 2007 however this limitation has eased in the recent past following the development of high computing techniques and the development of particle based modeling techniques the particle based modeling techniques allow the representation of micro scale features and units smaller than grid cells thus eliminating spatial diffusion need problems for spatial discretion cleary and prakash 2004 nevertheless the use of 3d modeling in flood inundation is recent and thus limited literature is currently available compared to 2d flood inundation modeling 3 2 3 simplified conceptual models these are models that don t simulate the physical processes associated with fluid flow and inundation but are majorly concentrated in simplified hydraulic concepts as much as they may fit within the two dimensional classification due to their dimensional representation of flows they are not hydrodynamic models these models solve the simplified shallow water equation by omitting one or two acceleration terms neelz and pender 2013 a good example of the non physics based models is the rapid flood spreading method which works by basically segmenting the flood plain according to topographic depressions and then spreading the flood volume by filling these depressions progressively according to the elevation and size lhomme et al 2008 this conceptual methodology also forms the basis of the flood modeler pro 2d fast solver these models can be used to predict final inundation within a short time since they require less computational capacity need compared to hydrodynamic models hlavcova et al 2005 mark et al 2004 other sets of conceptual models are based on the theory of the planar method where the flood extent is derived by the model intersecting several fine resolution plains using high resolution digital elevation models and directly linking water volumes with flood extents teng et al 2015 other models such as the height above the nearest drainage hand model work by normalizing the topography of the area of interest relative to the local heights of the nearby stream and estimating the flood inundation by selecting the cells whose model simulation values are less than the known long term water depth in the nearby stream nobre et al 2011 more generally conceptual models require less intense computational demands and are thus useful tools in large scale applications where the flood extents and depths are the only required outputs as dynamic effects are assumed to be insignificant 3 3 strengths and limitations of flood models different modeling techniques have their advantages and limitations specific models also have their strengths and limitation in this paper the strengths and limitations of models are analyzed in two stages to capture the general classification or categories as well as the specific models 3 3 1 analysis by models classification the overall strengths and limitations of the broader modeling categories and their suitability for the various flood studies are summarized in table 1 and discussed below 3 3 1 1 empirical models these models are perhaps the most instinctive and straightforward tools to understand flooding characteristics based on records and related input data they are normally assumed to be accurate since flood events have a certain history cycle of occurrence however the accuracy is highly dependent on the acquisition and processing methods adopted for the flood modeling and therefore high accuracy demand more costly acquisition processes and complex processing techniques for the input data the models are largely dependent on the wisdom of hindsight since they are a snapshot of the past and are thus limited in capturing the possible response to possible future scenarios or changes the limitation of the spatial and temporal coarseness of resolution of the outputs was common but these are improving with the use of remote sensing in data gathering other possible limitations of the methods and models include engineering faults associated with sensor design operations and transmission environmental drawbacks such as adverse weather conditions and other natural factors and the accuracy of the algorithms in data mining and processing imply the output information since these models are purely adopting the input output approach based on records any artificial error in the entire chain of processes can jeopardize the credibility of the resulting outputs and the decision making information being shared 3 3 1 2 hydrodynamic models these models are widely used tools in detailed flood dynamics simulations and are mostly linked to flood forecasting mapping and scenario analysis both in research and operations the critical characteristics of hydrodynamic models that perhaps explain their widespread usage in various applications are the ability to manipulate their inputs to investigate the impacts of changes in the initial conditions boundary conditions and topographic changes arising from the change in critical hydrodynamic features such as river streams culverts and stream channel volume the 1d hydrodynamics are usually computationally efficient since they consider flows in one direction and assume their steady and uniform however they have several limitations which include the inability to capture lateral and vertical wave diffusions of the flood waves considering topography as cross sections rather than the continuous surface and thus somehow subjective in factoring in orientation and topographical cross sections horritt and bates 2002 the 2d hydrodynamics generally can accurately simulate inundation timings and durations and are thus commonly used in different applications however they are computationally intensive especially when covering a large study area since they solve the full shallow water equation neelz and pender 2010 the 3d hydrodynamic models are generally considered not viable when covering an area of more than 1000 square kilometers especially when a high resolution simulation is required they are computationally intensive and may take prohibitively long and thus not reliable for quick forecasts that give enough lead time for interventions beven and binley 1992 3 3 1 3 simplified conceptual models these models require less computational capability than the hydrodynamic models they are relatively fast and robust and are most suited for applications that don t require flow velocity outputs and low demands in flow dynamics accuracy and representations teng et al 2017c the less computational requirement implies that conceptual models have a high runtime saving and are thus suitable for a large flood plain simulation and probabilistic risk assessment that demands multiple and large number simulations the models simulate flood extents water depths and overbank volumes much well on flood plains with clear flow paths but get more complicated in areas with complex topographies where momentum conservation is a significant factor overall conceptual models have no representation of flow dynamics or force fields don t capture wave dynamics and thus don t predict flow velocities lhomme et al 2008 the application of conceptual models is thus limited to areas of application where the flow dynamics effects are less significant in determining the direction and inundation characteristics table 2 overall the study reveals that most flood models can be applied in urban flood studies irrespective of their classification however each and specific model has its strengths and weaknesses that must be considered in every study and application as their objectives vary the strengths of hydrodynamic models allow their application in informal settlements where the land use changes are dynamic and the complexities of socio economic factors come to play wamuchiru 2012 the resolutions of the data inputs and the driving hydrological and hydrodynamics equations also determined the extent of the localized flood modeling in informal settlements to best address flood hazard risks in informal settlements the application of hydrological models that not only captures the rainfall runs off phenomenon but also allow the simulation and prediction of the flood movements and spread the existing and potential hydraulic systems and allows possible scenarios development based on the land use and land cover changes among other socio economic inputs one of the major challenges of flood hazard modeling and forecasting in informal settlements is the availability of reliable high resolution input data that need to be addressed in various developing cities neal et al 2012 however there exist various gridded reliable data sets that are continually bridging the gap moreover the flooding in most informal settlements usually manifests as part of a sub catchment whose characteristics provide some clue on the hydro climatic patterns in the area of interest since models are as good as the input data and the driving equations with their limitations the review calls for a proper choice of flood model for informal settlement flood studies and encourages their localization through calibration and validation processes using local ground truth data for valid and reliable outputs 3 4 the role of model calibration in flood modelling all flood models have their strengths and limitations regardless of their dimensionality complexity and mathematical frameworks in this regard it is nearly impossible to have a perfect model to solely simulate the natural hydrodynamic processes and thus flooding in urban areas teng et al 2017b these complexities of simulating urban floods become more evident in developing cities where the microenvironment land physical processes contribute significantly to the urban flood dynamics and thus need to be well captured in the model simulations de oliveira et al 2019 flood modeling however remains the core and perhaps the future of effective integrated flood risk management and thus the focus is on how best to use and improve the flood models and modeling processes especially in developing cities where the impacts of floods are most pronounced reynolds et al 2020 this study reveals that the calibration of the existing state of the art flood models allows contextualization and parameterization using the local and context specific input datasets and thus allows flood modeling in developing cities bout and jetten 2018 model calibration is therefore a significant process that allows the application of the existing flood models in developing cities however the discussions around model calibration always point to the concepts of uncertainties that must be determined and incorporated into the modeling process to ensure the results are sensible enough for the area of study dottori et al 2013 uncertainties in flood modeling may arise from the input data methodology or even the theory underpinning the specific modeling framework and these may undermine the accuracy and reliability of the research and flood risk management efforts o brien and zhao 2012 knijff et al 2010 uncertainties in flood models may contribute to the under or over estimation of the flood phenomenon and characteristics making the outputs unrealistic and thus misinforming the subsequent decisions koks et al 2015 flood model calibration therefore tends to play a critical role in addressing the model uncertainties to localize the model and thus make the model outputs more realistic allowing their application in developing cities uncertainties which are the possible unknown forcing in the modeling process are the motivation behind model calibration to enhance reliability and integrity uncertainties usually contribute significantly to the variation between the model predictions and the observed realities of the phenomenon liu et al 2009 in flood modeling the estimation of the uncertainties is critical to understand how and to what magnitude they cause variations between the model prediction and the observed realities as applied in different geographical areas in this regard uncertainties in flood modeling vary from one application to another depending on the input data the model being used and the area of study todini 2007 in as much as the sources of uncertainties in flood modeling may stem from the model design itself and the input data their estimation and communication instigate some confidence when using the model outputs in critical decision making and thus promote proactive strategies developments in flood risk management in as much as model calibrations seek to address the challenges of uncertainties the significance is to know to what extent a particular model can be applied and yield real results in a particular geographical location within the local contexts of scale and data availability todini 2007 in this case if a model is to be applied in a developing city the model is calibrated using the locally available data within the uncertainty boundaries to reach the optimal goodness of fit to best and convincingly capture the local context bales and wagner 2009 in the past few decades flood modeling literature has been discussing flood inundation model calibration and argues that most models haven t reached the optimal calibration limit this is partly due to the limited availability of appropriate and reliable calibration data especially in developing cities however the progress in remote sensing data availability is allowing some advancement in flood model calibrations and thus their applications in developing cities merwade et al 2008 while model calibration is aimed at reducing uncertainties a sensitivity analysis that aims at assessing the robustness of the model under various assumptions is also highly recommended while uncertainty analysis tends to address the impacts of the unknown in the model outputs sensitivity analysis focuses more on the effects of the known inputs on the model predictions aronica et al 1998 in this regard sensitivity analysis points out the factors that significantly influence the model outputs those that need further investigation and those factors that present a null influence on the outputs weichel et al 2007 sensitivity analysis therefore assists in understanding the sensitivity of the model outputs to the various input variable and factors despite its relevance in flood modeling few studies have been conducted in developing cities and more is yet to be done in informal settlements while there are questions on the existence and the choice of uncertainty and sensitivity analysis procedure that suits the complexity of flood modeling in developing cities several methodologies have been reported in various hydrological and flood modeling literature koks et al 2015 dottori et al 2013 methodologies such as the bayesian uncertainty estimation linear regression analysis and the monte carlo simulations which are based on statistical and mathematical modeling have been used widely in uncertainty and sensitivity analysis of flood models hall et al 2005 2009 while the choice of the methodologies can be determined by empirical and economic factors the bottom line focus on the optimization of the model performance to best inform flood risk management and therefore the uncertainty and sensitivity analysis play a critical role in flood modeling to evaluate the model behaviors and performance as applied in developing cities liu et al 2009 bales and wagner 2009 3 5 flood modelling the case of nairobi 3 5 1 flood risk among the nairobi urban poor nairobi is the capital city of kenya and about 60 of urban residents are estimated to live in informal settlements flooding is a major problem in the city especially in the informal settlements characterized by high poverty levels unplanned settlements poor infrastructures such as drainage networks and poor basic services thus the exposure and vulnerability to flooding risks are high dawson et al 2018 the rapid population increase in the city and the informal settlements have increased by homes built in riparian lands exposing residents to higher flood risk for example in kibera slums more than 22 000 residents live along the river banks of ngong river meandering the city and more than 50 confirm their homes have been flooded in the recent past since 2015 mulligan et al 2019 it can be confirmed that floods are nowadays experienced in areas where the occurrence was rather infrequent two decades ago in the city the flood risk in the nairobi informal settlement where a majority of the urban poor dwell is thus eminent to be addressed for the sustainable development of the city wamuchiru 2012 while city flooding is commonly reported the impacts are differently felt with the worst hit being the informal settlement and the urban poor this is a clear demonstration of the underlying drivers of flood risk vulnerabilities among the urban poor the continuous and rapid change in the land use and land cover due to urbanization has partly contributed to the increased runoff contributing to the city flooding despite the evident flood risks in nairobi and the eminent role flood modeling plays in integrated flood risk management this review has established that most studies on floods in nairobi have been focusing on vulnerability and risk perception in parts of the city and less on flood modeling besides most flood studies have been in the past concentrated in the rural areas where riverine flooding has been known to cover a vast area and impacts are closely monitored and recorded 3 5 2 flood modeling studies were done in nairobi a few studies in nairobi have been conducted focusing on flood modeling and this is a demonstration that flood models can be applied to simulate the city s flooding characteristics a study conducted by muli investigated flood modeling in nairobi based on the city hydrological processes considering the impacts of rapid urban development muli 2011 the study saw the setting up and calibration of the hec hms model using the available climate and river flow data for nairobi city as a watershed the study revealed that the city had a 55 imperviousness then and the increased imperviousness due to increased pavements buildings and roads reduces the soil conservation service lag time and the watershed runoff increases the correlation between the observed and model simulated run off yielded a coefficient of the determinant of 0 82 revealing the model significantly captured the city hydrodynamics the study also considered different scenarios and revealed that nairobi city had a 43 chance of flooding after every 2 33 years muli 2011 the impact of an increased imperviousness from 55 to 60 due to rapid infrastructural developments was an increased mean annual flow from 50 m3 s to 345 m3 s which is a 600 increment that the existing drainage networks cannot sustain this revealed a high risk of flooding if the drainage networks are not matched to the increased imperviousness of the city okoth and colleagues 2016 conducted a study on integrated urban pluvial flooding analysis and modeling for nairobi west and south c areas in nairobi in this study the increased risks of pluvial flooding are reiterated due to the rapid urbanization characterized by urban densification inadequate city drainage network and continually changing urban hydrology okoth et al 2016 the study employed the use of the storm water management model version 5 1 using the available gis data rainfall river flow and sewer network data the study reveals that significant flooding of 20 134 ha m surface runoff yields about 81 of sewer system surcharging in the city a sensitivity analysis of the model shows that the peak runoff significantly responds to variations in imperviousness parameters the study concludes that the swmm5 1 model can be applied in simulating urban pluvial flooding and contribute to stormwater and flood management in nairobi hall et al 2005 2009 urban flood modeling in most cases is thought of as an analytical process purely focusing on the empirical inputs and physical processes mulligan and colleagues mulligan et al 2019 conducted a study where participatory flood modeling for negotiation and planning in the urban informal settlement of kibera in nairobi while acknowledging the role of analytical methods and hydrological models in flood risk management the study emphasizes the role of wider stakeholder engagement and contributions in urban flood management especially in informal settlements the study develops a new case based knowledge to inform the application of participatory modeling and planning for informal urban areas the study uses the newly established framework for the classification of participatory modeling approaches developed by basco carrera and colleagues basco carrera et al 2017 and concludes that there are high chances of developing implementable plans and policies for flood risk management when wider stakeholders including those upstream are involved there are indications that more flood models are possibly being applied in nairobi under different ongoing research projects and are yet to be published more generally various studies on urban flooding have focused on the vulnerability exposure and impacts from the social perspectives and only a few on flood modeling this review therefore points out the gap in flood modeling as a tool in flood risk management in nairobi especially in informal settlements 3 5 3 the role of flood model stacking in understanding city wide and sub city flood risks mukuru informal settlement in nairobi city covers almost 650 acres and is home to at least 300 000 people who continually face the risk of urban floods the kenyan government has recently adopted the special planning area spa model of slum upgrading where mukuru was identified as the first spa in 2017 horn 2021 the model allows coordinated and integrated infrastructural development while improving the service delivery to the residents tomorrow s city has been working with the local authorities and partners to promote risk knowledge in the planning and implementation of the spa in mukuru in this regard there is a need to understand the flood risks in the spa and integrate this knowledge into the mitigation strategies for a sustainable city douglas et al 2008 flood modeling that captures the local characteristics at the sub city level is thus critical however the flooding in the informal settlement of mukuru in nairobi doesn t solely come from the local area the city wide activities drainage network rainfall and settlements among others could be contributing to the flooding in mukuru spa this calls for the city wide flood dynamics understanding before narrowing it down to the flood dynamics and the underlying vulnerabilities that enhance the flood risks in mukuru slums model stacking is an efficient ensemble method in which the predictions generated by using a specific or more model algorithm are used as inputs in the second layer of algorithms this framework can be applied in flood modeling in the informal settlement to better integrated flood risk management zounemat kermani et al 2021 for instance the tomorrows cities research project in nairobi explores the integration of physical science modeling social science understanding and community participation in flood risk management in the implementation of the mukuru spa from this review and application of the framework of model stacking a combination of flood models has been identified to be applied to achieve the project objectives concerning flood modeling the soil and water accounting tool swat will be used to understand the flood dynamics at the city level using the topographical climatic soil and river discharge data kim et al 2016 the outputs of the model will allow the estimation of floods reaching mukuru informal settlements from elsewhere in the city the hydrologic engineering center s river analysis system hec ras 2d model will be used to simulate the flood characteristics within the mukuru spa the combination of the two models at various stages all aim at comprehensively understanding the flood hazard risks in the city and the informal settlement to inform the participatory approach of the spa model in upgrading the slum towards a sustainable city rangari et al 2019 the local flood characteristics in the informal settlement require a model that can effectively capture the hydraulic networks and the stream geometry while integrating the vulnerability aspects at the local level 4 conclusion while flood modeling is a crucial tool to support effective integrated flood risk management developing cities and thus informal settlements struggle with their applications due to limited high resolution accurate and consistent input data for model calibration flood impacts in developing cities which are mostly domiciled in the developing states are most pronounced in the informal settlement and thus the application of flood modeling is a critical component of integrated flood risk management this practice requires both city wide and sub city flood modeling and thus the paper points out the model stacking framework as a method and proposes practices such as nature based solutions in flood risk management in developing cities ferreira et al 2021 flood modeling requires very crucial hydraulic flood inundation data among other data sets which are either unavailable inconsistent inaccurate or inaccessible in most informal settlements of developing cities this trend poses a challenge and perhaps explains partially the limited number of studies in flood modeling in developing cities and more so in informal settlements however the urgency to address the prevailing urban flood risks in developing cities supersedes the existing gaps and thus spontaneous studies involving the application of flood models have been conducted the advancement in remote sense data coupled with the available although limited ground observed data allows the calibration and application of flood models in developing cities and the informal settlement to inform flood risk management the review therefore concludes that the application of flood modeling in developing cities and informal settlements is possible but requires effective model calibration using the local data to capture the local flow realities and processes model stacking to understand the city wide flood dynamics and advocates for participatory and inclusive practices to address the local vulnerabilities associated with flood risks flood modeling is thus an essential technique for ineffective integrated flood risk management in developing cities and informal settlements the study also suggests further studies in exploring the performance of the different models in various cities with different contexts and focusing on integrated flood risk management this is because what works for one context may not necessarily work for another informal settlement in developing cities with the continued impacts of climate change

7872,study region varahi river originating from the western ghats of india study focus we developed a hybrid model that integrates process based hydrological model phm and data driven dd techniques to generate streamflow simulations precisely the hybrid modeling framework is practical as it respects hydrological processes through the phm while considering the advantage of the dd model s ability to simulate the complex relationship between residuals and input variables further we have proposed an optimization based nudging scheme for post processing the hybrid model simulated streamflow to overcome the limitations in phm and dd new hydrological insights for the region we formulated two approaches for simulating streamflow ensembles using dd and phm models in approach 1 dd models are initially used to ensemble meteorological variables and then use the ensembles in a phm to simulate streamflows in approach 2 phm is forced with different sets of meteorological variables to simulate multiple streamflow sets and then use dd models to ensemble the phm derived streamflows random forest exhibited better performance for ensembling precipitation temperature and streamflow datasets compared to the other five dd algorithms in the study streamflows generated using approach 2 showed reliable estimates when compared against observed streamflow values however post processing the hybrid streamflows using an optimization based nudging scheme outperformed the streamflows generated in approach 1 and approach 2 with better model fit statistics r2 and nse of 0 69 and 0 66 the output from the nudging scheme was further utilized for streamflow predictions under the combined impact of land use cover lulc and climate change cc under the representative concentration pathway 4 5 scenario it depicted a decrease in monthly and seasonal stream flows with 22 65 31 77 11 81 for winter summer and monsoon seasons respectively these results suggest that water availability will decline and water scarcity will increase in the study region these variations in streamflow might negatively impact agriculture and natural ecosystems and even lead to water restrictions in the region graphical abstract ga1 keywords data driven techniques ensemble global circulation model nudging process based model streamflow simulation data availability data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request 1 introduction accurate and reliable simulation of streamflow and analyzing its sensitivity to various man made natural and climatic aspects has been a notion of research for many decades konapala et al 2020 previously researchers have used process based hydrological models phm to examine hydrological processes in a catchment kolluru et al 2020a 2020b however data driven dd techniques with efficient computational ability proved to be powerful tools for modeling complex non linear behaviors abda et al 2022 nearing et al 2021 while phms that precisely characterize the hydrological processes can be considered a standard coupling them with dd models can serve as a robust methodology for simulating realistic water balance components abda et al 2022 sharannya et al 2021 researchers have been applying various phms to understand the catchment behavior in the rainfall runoff relationship for decades these phms were tested on various basins to explore this heterogenous time space varying complex relationship mani et al 2020 sharannya et al 2018 modeling rainfall runoff relationships through phms requires modeling potential interactions between meteorological surface and subsurface characteristics it is often complicated leading to uncertainties and poor streamflow simulations hence state of the art dd models were introduced in hydrology to avoid uncertainties and to simulate reliable streamflow estimates using satellite reanalysis global circulation model gcm precipitation datasets gharbia et al 2022 liu et al 2022 ni et al 2020 though dd models exhibited promising results in various studies long term data requirements and lack of process representation often led to spurious and inaccurate simulations these inaccurate simulations occur mainly when the simulations are beyond the data range used for dd model training and testing kolluru et al 2020b read et al 2019 to overcome the limitations imposed by a single model hybrid models phm dd were developed and tested in some basins to supplement each other in their respective strengths and limitations boucher et al 2020 xu et al 2022 while the phms confidently capture the energy and water balance based on the underlying physical laws dd models can capture these processes efficiently using a training dataset without considering the physical laws of the hydrological model konapala et al 2020 previous studies incorporating this hybrid modeling behavior exhibited better performance in simulating streamflows abda et al 2022 gharbia et al 2022 alizadeh et al 2020 used a hybrid feature selection strategy employing the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator lasso and particle swarm optimization artificial neural networks pso ann to predict streamflows accurately at the karaj river in iran abda et al 2022 proposed rainfall runoff models based on machine learning to forecast daily streamflows in the oued sebaou watershed northern algeria he used historical data of streamflow and rainfall amounts as input for random forest rf artificial neural networks ann and local weighted linear regression lwlr similarly adnan et al 2021 used the locally weighted learning lwl algorithm to anticipate streamflow by combining it with additive regression ar bagging bg dagging dg random subspace rs and rotation forest models their results suggested that the ensemble lwl ar technique effectively simulated the streamflow additionally li et al 2019 employed numerous dd models for effectively forecasting daily streamflow including support vector regression svr backpropagation neural network bpnn rf and extreme learning machine with kernels elm kernel furthermore yang et al 2020 proposed a hybrid model combining process based and dd hydrological models for rainfall runoff simulation in data scarce watersheds they offered three methods to enhance the predictive power of machine learning based hydrological models a synthetic dataset was used to assess the learning behavior of the process based distributed hydrological model and observed data was used to examine the model s predictive power kilinc and haznedar 2022 suggested a hybrid approach including long short term memory lstm networks and a genetic algorithm ga to estimate streamflow they have used daily flow data to compare the performance of the benchmark model with the hybrid model berbić et al 2022 used three supervised learning models to model mean monthly flow nearest neighbor nnm method support vector machine svm and ann two optimization algorithms ga and simulated annealing sa were used to optimize the selection of parameters and the trustworthy set of input variables essenfelder and giupponi 2020 proposed a coupled machine learning hydrologic modeling method to simulate inter basin water transfer iwt flow contributions in the absence of observational data they used machine learning techniques to effectively replicate the decision making process of iwts and the hydrologic model to simulate the rainfall runoff process of a watershed xu et al 2022 proved that long term hydrological simulations could be generated when deep learning models convolutional neural network cnn and lstm are combined with semi distributed hydrological model soil and water assessment tool swat furthermore liu et al 2022 coupled meteorological forecasts from a land surface hydrological model and a machine learning model to simulate hourly streamflows over a cascading reservoir catchment in southwest china kolluru and kolluru 2021 have proposed and tested pre and post integration of satellite precipitation products to efficiently predict drought using dd algorithms over india they proved that pre integration of precipitation datasets using dd algorithms predicted drought more accurately than post integration of precipitation datasets literature incorporating hybrid models was concentrated on arid and humid basins and research on mountainous tropical basins was scarce modeling flows in tropical basins is challenging as most models fail to predict simulate the peak flows with basins having an average annual rainfall of 3500 mm though hybrid models enhance the predictions the training data from previous decades might not predict the current meteorological trends in the basins further the historical and future climate data obtained from gcms are coarse and are subjective to more bias limiting their application over regional basins di virgilio et al 2020 furthermore the literature mentioned above used dd models or phms separately or in combination to predict the streamflow however none of them adopted post processing techniques on the hybrid model outputs to further increase the capability of streamflow predictions by eliminating their residuals this motivated us to develop and test a new framework by applying optimization based nudging as a post processing technique to improve the hybrid phm dd model based ensemble streamflow simulations previous studies have used the nudging technique to solve the mismatch between surface and root zone soil moisture measured from field based and remote sensing derived soil moisture loizu et al 2018 mazzoleni et al 2018 have used a nudging scheme to assimilate stream flow into a muskingum routing scheme in a spatially lumped or distributed hydrological model furthermore ciabatta et al 2015 kolluru and kolluru 2021 and massari et al 2014 have used this nudging technique to integrate two precipitation datasets these studies assumed the nudging term k value to be constant whereas the k value in the classical assimilation technique may vary in time while the proposed methodology is applied to a tropical basin in india it can be generalized to any study dealing with climate change or any basin with measured streamflow records our study is framed to test 1 whether pre ensemble of meteorological precipitation and temperature data or post ensemble of streamflow from multiple simulations improves the streamflow predictions 2 which dd algorithm can effectively ensemble precipitation and streamflow data 3 whether post processing techniques improve the streamflow output from the hybrid modeling simulations to test these objectives we have considered 5 gcms from ipcc 5 future climatic data for 1951 2040 we have employed semi distributed soil and water assessment tool swat phm for simulating streamflow six dd algorithms random forest rf bayesian regularized neural network brnn generalized linear model glm gradient boosting model gbm k nearest neighbors k nn and cubist differ in their structure and modeling behavior were considered for precipitation temperature and streamflow dataset ensembles we have further incorporated an optimization based nudging scheme for post processing the hybrid model simulated streamflow for accurately representing the basin runoff the developed framework was tested in a tropical basin varahi of western ghats india the analysis was further extended to understand 1 the impacts of land use land cover lulc and climate change cc on streamflow patterns and 2 the basin s future seasonal and monthly streamflow trends 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the western ghats wg is the mountainous region along india s west coast stretching along the coast for around 2300 km they are essential in moderating indian tropical monsoon systems with their characteristic forest habitats mudbhatkal and amai 2018 they are spread over 100 200 kilometers from the seacoast across the indian states of gujarat maharashtra and karnataka the varahi river is one of the west flowing rivers originating from the high peaks of the western ghats at a place called hebbagilu at a mean sea level of 716 m with an area of 813 km2 jayasree and venkatsh 2012 the catchment is managed by the central water commission the government of india in haladi the west coast comprises a coastal plain with crops and a lateral plateau that dominates the basin s middle area whereas a thick forest in western ghats hilly areas fig 1 the average annual rainfall over the area is around 3753 mm the temperature is between 19 3 and 29 8 c and is characterized by a humid and tropical environment 2 2 data used the hydrological model requires meteorological data to define the weather inputs rainfall maximum and minimum temperature tmax and tmin data at a daily time step was obtained from gauge based gridded data developed by the india meteorological department imd which was considered as a standard reference these gridded data with a spatial resolution of 0 25 were downloaded from 1951 to 2018 for calibrating and validating phm stream flow data from 1986 to 2018 daily was procured from the central water commission india digital elevation model dem for catchment delineation was downloaded from national remote sensing centre http www nrsc gov in land use maps were derived from landsat imagery and soil data were collected from the national bureau of soil survey nbss india to define the catchment characteristics data from five bias corrected gcms were used to evaluate future projected climatic trends these five gcms were selected based on previous research that tested the efficiency of these gcms in simulating the streamflow effectively sinha et al 2020a swain et al 2020 the five gcms under representative concentration pathway rcp 4 5 and 8 5 emission scenarios representing average and extreme greenhouse gas emission scenarios usman et al 2021 were bias corrected using a quantile based mapping technique to limit the uncertainty kannan and ghosh 2013 salvi et al 2013 the gcms used were bnu esm of beijing climate center gcm1 canesm2 of canadian centre for climate modeling and analysis gcm2 china meteorological administration cnrm cm5 of centre national de recherches meteorologiques centre europeen de recherche et formation avancees en calcul scientifique gcm3 mpi esm lr gcm4 and mpi esm mr gcm5 of max planck institute for meteorology 2 3 ensemble of streamflow in the current study two approaches precipitation ensemble streamflow i e pesf and streamflow ensemble streamflow i e sesf are proposed to simulate reliable streamflow estimates as shown in fig 2 the first approach involves ensembling precipitation and temperature datasets from five gcms using dd techniques and further simulating streamflows pesf using phm in contrast the second approach uses each gcm to generate streamflow using phm these streamflows from five different gcm based inputs are ensembled using dd techniques to generate sesf a temporal sub setting approach was implemented to carry out the approaches by dividing total precipitation temperature and streamflow datasets for training and testing the dd models during the calibration and validation stages continuous precipitation data was utilized for training and testing the dd models during calibration and validation stages to cover the low and extreme rainfall events that transpire over non monsoon summer and monsoon seasons all the gcm grids are at the same grid location of the observed dataset imd with a 0 25 spatial grid resolution and monthly temporal resolution to establish homogenous raster geometry the two approaches and the adopted combinations are discussed below 2 3 1 approach 1 in approach 1 pesf initially 68 years 1951 2018 of precipitation and temperature datasets were segregated for calibration 1951 2008 and validation 1974 2018 phases the overlapping period for calibration and validation is selected to accommodate a sufficient number of years for training and testing the dd models the calibration data which spans from 1951 to 2008 was further segregated into two groups with 35 years 1951 1985 of data for training dd techniques and the remaining 23 years 1986 2008 of data for testing ensembled products pre ensemble of meteorological variable during the validation phase 35 years of data from 1974 to 2008 was used for training and ten years from 2009 to 2018 were employed for testing the dd techniques furthermore the ensembled precipitation data from these gcms using six dd techniques were compared with the observed precipitation data imd the best performed model output from these six dd models was selected for further simulating the streamflow using phm the simulated streamflow pesf with the best performed dd model ensembled precipitation input is compared against the observed streamflow finally the output of pesf will be compared with the streamflow generated using approach 2 sesf to choose the best approach that can accurately simulate the streamflow of a basin 2 3 2 approach 2 to implement the second approach initially the streamflow was simulated using phm i e the swat model by forcing the model with each gcms precipitation and temperature data of 68 years 1951 2018 further a temporal sub setting approach like approach 1 was adopted for the output of phm the streamflows simulated using the swat model were divided into two groups with 35 years 1951 1985 of streamflow data for training and the remaining 23 years 1986 2008 of streamflow data for testing the dd model during the calibration stage during validation 35 years of streamflow data 1974 to 2008 was used for training and ten years of streamflow data 2009 to 2018 was employed for testing the dd model the streamflow output from different gcm based precipitation and temperature inputs were integrated post ensemble of streamflow using the six dd techniques for generating sesf data the six ensembled streamflow results from six dd model outputs were compared with observed streamflow to identify the best dd model and are further compared with approach 1 to identify the best approach that can accurately replicate a basin s streamflow patterns the proposed two approaches will help understand whether the streamflow should be simulated through a pre ensemble of meteorological variables or a post ensemble of streamflow datasets that can accurately capture the actual pattern of observed stream flows furthermore the two approaches will help examine the behavior and capability of dd techniques to simulate datasets that can reasonably match the observed datasets of precipitation and streamflow overall to carry out these two approaches first precipitation and temperature values are extracted at each grid cell for 68 years second dd techniques were applied to ensemble the best precipitation first approach or streamflow second approach values trained using observed data as predictors third the trained dd techniques were further employed to predict the daily rainfall and streamflow values with the left over data in both calibration and validation stages over the study area finally the output from dd techniques is used to simulate the streamflow using phm 2 4 process based model the process based semi distributed model i e soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 has been widely used in assessing the impact of climate change on water balance components in the past two decades mani et al 2020 the applications of the swat model include examining the potential impacts of land use management and climate change on hydrology and water resources assessment of watershed response to land cover land use changes on the annual water balance and temporal runoff dynamics guevara ochoa et al 2020 and testing the model in different climatic catchments venkatesh et al 2020b the swat model is intended to compute and route water sediments and contaminants from the individual drainage units sub basins to their outlets throughout the river basin the swat model was supplied with the dem lulc map and the nbss soil map the model was calibrated and validated with swat calibration and uncertainty programs swat cup using the sequential uncertainty fitting sufi 2 algorithm that implements the latin hypercube procedure against the daily runoff data from 1986 to 2008 and 2009 2018 for the study area we used percent bias pbias coefficient of determination r2 and the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse to examine the model performance the criteria suggested by moriasi et al 2015 were used for evaluating the model performance 2 5 data driven models in this study precipitation and streamflow datasets were ensembled and predicted using six dd models employing two approaches as the objective of the current study is to ascertain the accurate dd techniques to integrate different precipitation pre ensemble of meteorological variables or streamflow datasets post integration of streamflow all models were trained and tested by implementing cross validation and hyperparameter tuning the details of the hyperparameter values and cross validation techniques were presented in a supplementary file for reference supplementary table s1 the hyperparameters were optimized to obtain a better fit with rmse as the test statistic a sample figure supplementary fig s1 was represented in a supplementary file depicting the role of hyperparameter optimization to achieve better accuracy lower rmse the six dd techniques implemented in the current study are 2 5 1 random forest rf rf is a robust ensemble classifier that uses decision trees to generate predictions breiman 2001 wagle et al 2020 rf regression

in decision trees increasing accuracy 2 5 2 bayesian regularized neural network brnn bayesian regularization is a non linear mathematical procedure that turns a well positioned statistical issue into ridge regression brnn is more resilient and can minimize long cross validation requirements than regular backpropagation networks kolluru et al 2021b standard neural networks have trouble determining the number of hidden neurons which might hinder the learning process either in excess or low brnns trained with effective network parameters or weights implement the bayes theorem into the regularization scheme to prevent overfitting this is considerably smaller than the number of weights in a standard fully connected backpropagation neural network which can be challenging to stop if over trained sariev and germano 2020 2 5 3 generalized linear model glm the notion of a widely recognized linear regression model is extended by a generalized linear model glm it introduces a link function around the linear combination of the explanatory variable abdulkabir et al 2015 it consists of three components i a random component which refers to the probability distribution of the response variable ii a linear predictor that is a linear function of regressors and iii a linearizing link function that is smooth and inverted which converts the expectation of response variable to the linear predictor 2 5 4 gradient boosting model gbm gbm is a decision tree based dd model that incorporates boosting techniques to enhance model performance boosting is a statistical technique that combines the efforts of several weaker models to produce a robust model by reducing the mean squared error mse of all the models schapire 2003 an inefficient model is defined as a learner with slightly better performance than random guessing the final predictions are developed in an additive forward propagation where a new learner is attached at every node reducing the negative gradient by least squares the residuals of the past model are further employed as an input for the next model learner allowing the model to learn and enhance from the errors of the past models hastie et al 2001 2 5 5 k nearest neighbors knn knn is the simplest non parametric dd model that does not make any prior assumptions regarding the probability distribution of input data knn generates the predictions by considering the weighted mean of k nearest neighbors developed based on the inverse of their distances the present work implements the fitcknn function to establish the knn model with dependent options euclidean distance and a single neighbor option are addressed in knn for regression fit between observed precipitation and gcm datasets kolluru and kolluru 2021 2 5 6 cubist cubist is a rule based algorithm that allocates class membership through recursive partitioning input variables into similar subclasses or trees quinlan 1993 each tree develops an endpoint leaf that contains a linear regression model for prediction in the conceptual cubist regression model the cubist approach generates several rules at each tree as if after after that overlap with each other if the covariate set meets the criteria defined by the rules the model in question is utilized to determine the value predicted cubists can also develop sub models that consist of committee members associated with a set of rules kuhn et al 2017 each committee member under a sub model generates a prediction and all these predictions are averaged to generate the outcome 2 6 post processing using nudging based optimization nudging based optimization is introduced to curtail the limitation of pesf and sesf and to improve the streamflow simulations a new framework has been developed to improve the hybrid phm dd model based ensemble streamflow simulations using optimization based nudging as a post processing technique nudging is a dynamic relaxation process that matches the output of a model to observations for data assimilation in conventional data assimilation theory nudging involves adding a gain term k in this study to a parameter measured derived to enhance model performance kolluru et al 2020a we used an optimization approach to reduce the error between modeled and observed streamflow and to identify the nudging coefficient k the integration between two datasets pesf sesf was carried out by employing the local optimization fmincon function kolluru et al 2020a a basic nudging scheme is formulated in eq 1 to integrate these two variables 1 s int t s p ⅇ sf t k s sesf t s pesf t where sint is the integrated streamflow product spesf and ssesf are streamflow estimates from pesf and sesf k is a variable with a similar role in the classical data assimilation method in the kalman filter ciabatta et al 2015 a calibration strategy is adopted to find the value of k by optimizing the root mean square error rmse between observed and integrated products the k value varies between 0 and 1 where the higher the value the greater the weight given to pesf and the lower weight to sesf this integration technique s concept is comparable to the advanced bayesian model averaging and inverse error square averaging these techniques use diverse prediction abilities of different models by giving greater weights to better model performance and lower weights to poorer predictions more information about the algorithm can be found in ciabatta et al 2015 kolluru and kolluru 2021 massari et al 2014 mazzoleni et al 2018 2 7 combined impact of cc and lulc on streamflow a river basin experiences lulc and climate change simultaneously exerting a combined impact on streamflow to understand this combined impact the improved streamflow simulations from the optimization based nudging scheme were adopted for a future period 2021 2040 under rcp 4 5 with lulc of 2030 future lulc was predicted using the dynamic conversion of land use and its effects dyna clue model dyna clue is a versatile and generic structure that supports regional scale applications one of the main features of the dyna clue model is its elasticity for each lu type which makes it reluctant to to convert a specific land use type to another various investigations have used the dyna clue model to justify the model s applicability behera and behera 2020 3 results 3 1 evaluation of discrete gcm precipitation and temperature products against imd data the statistical metrics computed using 68 years of daily rainfall maximum temperature tmax and minimum temperature tmin data from each gcm against imd data are represented in table 1 gcm1 i e bnu performed slightly better than other gcms however all models failed to capture the precipitation and temperature patterns concerning imd datasets furthermore the statistical values table 1 portray the poor skill of gcm to predict precipitation than tmax and tmin each climate model differs in the physical laws governing the climate system hence they might have exhibited mixed results one climate model may prove efficient in some regions or seasons whereas the other may perform better in another location and season to tackle these differences performing an ensemble might yield the most efficient model output a basic ensemble technique i e a normal algebraic average was performed on the gcms which depicted a better performance than individual gcms table 1 the r2 nse and rmse of the normal algebraic precipitation average compared against imd are 0 34 0 33 21 20 during calibration and 0 39 0 38 and 21 89 during validation respectively tmax and tmin showed an r2 nse and rmse of 0 65 0 64 1 51 and 0 62 0 56 and 1 46 respectively during calibration during the validation period tmax and tmin exhibited an r2 nse and pbias of 0 66 0 65 1 52 and 0 60 0 45 and 1 60 respectively dd techniques were adopted to improve these meteorological variable results further and compare them against the observed data model performance for dd models is represented in table 2 it can be observed that all six dd models performed better than individual gcm output cubist showed poor results out of six dd models whereas random forest rf performed much better than other models the rf model has an r2 nse and rmse of 0 51 0 51 18 06 and 0 55 0 54 and 18 79 respectively during calibration and validation for precipitation which depicts its higher capability for replicating the variables the rf model performed superior to other dd models in predicting maximum and minimum temperatures with r2 of 0 66 nse of 0 65 pbias of 1 49 for tmax and r2 of 0 63 nse of 0 60 and pbias of 1 39 for tmin during calibration during validation the rf model exhibited an r2 nse and rmse of 0 67 0 67 1 49 for tmax and an r2 nse and rmse of 0 63 0 62 and 1 34 for tmin respectively 3 2 calibration and validation of swat model the swat model simulations were performed with the standard parameters and are calibrated with the sufi 2 algorithm under swat cup the model generated 30 sub basins and 608 hydrological response units hrus a series of iterations were performed to match the simulated results with the observed data the best fitted values of the most sensitive parameters during calibration were utilized without alteration during the validation stage the haladi gauging station the outlet of the study area was used to calibrate streamflow of 33 years of recorded data 23 years 1986 2008 were considered for calibration and ten years 2009 2018 for validation at a daily time step the r2 nse and pbias during calibration are 0 82 0 79 and 8 23 whereas the r2 nse and pbias during the validation period are 0 85 0 66 and 19 37 respectively these statistics indicate a good model performance for monthly streamflow simulations moriasi et al 2015 sharannya et al 2016 sinha et al 2020a table 3 lists the sensitive parameters with their minimum maximum and fitted values used for calibration all the r2 and nse values for the streamflow simulations are greater than 0 75 and the pbias values are in the range of 20 for both calibration and validation periods suggesting good model performance table 3 according to moriasi et al 2015 furthermore the statistics and ranking of the sensitive parameters used in calibrating the swat model are listed in table 3 the most sensitive parameters for streamflow are scs runoff curve number cn followed by the groundwater delay gw delay threshold depth of water in the shallow aquifer required for return flow to occur gwqmn groundwater revap coefficient gw revap saturated hydraulic conductivity sol k plant uptake compensation factor epco and other parameters table 3 3 3 performance assessment of swat hybrid models and nudging scheme in simulating streamflows table 4 illustrates the model performance under individual gcm based swat streamflow output among the five gcm based inputs the gcm4 esm lr based swat model simulated more accurate stream flows r2 0 65 nse 0 56 pbias 39 87 though esm lr depicted good performance selecting a single gcm has been repeatedly recognized as the primary cause of uncertainty in gcm selection reshmidevi and nagesh kumar 2014 hence multiple gcms are considered input into phm or dd models to overcome the uncertainty instead of adopting a single gcm furthermore finalizing these model accuracies and simulations based on either phm or dd model has been repeatedly recognized as the primary contributor to the overall uncertainty in its assessments and selection hence the hybrid models phm dd were developed and tested in the basin to overcome the uncertainties and limitations imposed due to the stand alone model based streamflow output the hybrid models add strength and complement the limitations to simulate precise model output the hybrid models were developed by employing two approaches pesf and sesf as described in section 2 3 it can be observed from table 4 that pesf and sesf generated streamflows more efficiently than individual gcms r2 nse and pbias for pesf are 0 61 0 57 39 56 and sesf are 0 62 0 58 39 17 respectively though hybrid models resulted in improved streamflow simulations compared to individual models rf performed better than all other dd models hence it is considered the best performed technique in the sesf phase among the two approaches sesf rf exhibited better performance with an r2 of 0 62 nse of 0 58 and pbias of 39 17 than pesf this implied that post ensemble results could depict better performance than pre ensemble using dd techniques the superiority of post ensemble model results might be because the stream flows simulated by phm are used to tune dd models to establish reference streamflow in the pre ensembling phase the dd models were trained with temperature and precipitation data to establish reference meteorological data and later used to simulate stream flows using phm fig 3 depicts the line plot for the stream flows cumecs generated using different approaches from 1986 to 2018 stream flows simulated using imd rainfall and temperature are denoted as imdsf it can be observed from the figure that pesf underestimates the low flows that occur in the early stages of a year and sesf overestimates the peak flow which appears during the middle phase of a year of analysis a new framework was proposed and implemented by applying optimization based nudging as a post processing technique to improve the hybrid phm dd model based ensemble streamflow simulations nudging based optimization is mainly introduced to curtail the limitation of pesf and sesf and improve the streamflow simulations the capability of nudging based optimization to establish the reference streamflow nudgesf against observed streamflow can be observed in table 4 the optimization based integrated streamflow outperformed all individual gcm based simulated streamflow and ensemble stream flows acceptable and satisfactory correlation coefficients and nse 0 69 and 0 66 were observed between observed and simulated stream flows though the pbias value 35 09 is not acceptable the streamflow simulations generated using the integrated technique were improved indicating the technique s efficiency in merging datasets since these findings demonstrate nudging systems capability to enhance streamflow simulations testing integration techniques in other basins are further recommended future studies employing this method should consider various meteorological datasets to verify the precision of the optimization approach in simulating stream flows and its efficiency as a post processing technique 3 4 cc lulc results genuine insight into the reasons for the streamflow variation can be provided only through the combined influence of climate change and lulc changes rather than considering them individually therefore the best simulated streamflow i e nudgesf was further utilized to understand the combined impact of lulc and climate change on streamflow patterns and to comprehend future seasonal and monthly streamflow trends in the basin the best fitted value for the sensitive parameters obtained from the swat cup table 3 was used to simulate future streamflows from 2020 to 2040 the lulc for the year 2030 was predicted using the dyna clue model and was provided as input for the swat model to predict the streamflow under the combined lulc and climate scenario the lulc maps for the years 2003 historical period and 2030 future period are illustrated in fig 1 the changes in various lulc types of the varahi river basin are calculated and presented in table 5 it was perceived that the agricultural land increased by 9 71 with a decrease in the forest area of 3 6 catchment experienced reduced barren land 5 8 and an increase in the urban area 0 2 the primary land conversion is from forest to agriculture agriculture to urban and water body to barren these are in line with the observations of sinha et al 2020a 2020b fig 4 illustrates the spider chart depicting monthly variations in historical and future stream flows cumecs these flows were generated using the nudging technique under the combined cc and lulc scenarios it could be examined from fig 4 that in the future period under the combined impact of cc and lulc there is a decrease in streamflow the reduction of future streamflow pertained to decreased rainfall and barren land in the catchment fig 5 represents the percentage change in seasonal streamflow a higher decline in streamflow was observed during the summer 31 78 than in the monsoon 11 81 it can be observed that the streamflow declined by 22 65 during winter and had an overall decline in annual streamflow of 22 08 proper irrigation and water supply schedules should be adopted to curtail the streamflow depletion in the study area for sustainable land and water management operations 4 discussion our study findings demonstrate that different strategies or approaches can be utilized and adopted under discrete catchment areas to improve the streamflow simulations previous studies mudbhatkal et al 2017 sinha et al 2020a predicted and simulated streamflows using single or multiple gcms kim et al 2016 asserted that the uncertainties in gcms emanate from the initial and lateral boundary conditions schemes for parameterization carbon cycle representation and inadequate insights into the climate theory ahmed et al 2020 suggested that the generation of the dd model ensemble is one of the most widely adopted approaches for reducing the uncertainty arising from gcm recently a study by sikorska senoner and quilty 2021 suggested using phm in conjunction with dd to establish a good output quality hence in the present study a hybrid model phm and dd is employed that combines the advantages of a phm intended to respect physical connections between hydrological processes with the capabilities of the dd model which can model complex relationships between input and target variables addressing our first research question whether pre ensemble of gcm data pesf or post ensemble of streamflow sesf from multiple simulations improves the streamflow predictions we found that the post ensemble of streamflow resulted in a better performance than the pre ensemble of meteorological data this could be due to the usage of phm simulated streamflow by dd models to establish the reference flow during the post processing phase dd models can effectively develop links between input and target using a training dataset without considering the physical laws of the hydrological model in the case of pesf a dd model s input and target are gcm and imd precipitation and temperature though pesf improves the accuracy of the meteorological variables i e gcms using dd models the accuracy depends on a particular gcm in predicting precipitation and temperature the low competencies of gcms in simulating precipitation compared to tmax and tmin are commonly described in the literature ahmed et al 2020 flato et al 2013 reported that using thermodynamic balance makes gcms predictions more efficient in representing temperature than precipitation simulations achieved by simple parameterization through predicting actual processes in the case of sesf the input and target of the dd model are the streamflows generated using individual gcms and reference streamflow thus the dd tries to establish statistical links between these target and input variables using a training dataset without including any classic hydrological modeling behaviors the results align with sikorska senoner and quilty 2021 highlighting the importance of improving the accuracy of streamflow simulations using dd models the phm generated output transfers the information about the reference and simulated streamflow acquired through calibrated phm parameters to the dd models adding the additional information not apprehended by the phm to simulate ensemble streamflow thus the sesf can overcome specific issues of the pesf addressing our second question which dd algorithm can effectively ensemble the precipitation and streamflow data we found that rf performed efficiently though all six dd models improved the hydro meteorological predictions rf outperformed other dd models which is consistent with the previous research results abda et al 2022 ahmed et al 2020 that accentuated the efficiency of rf in generating the streamflow efficiently rf is a group of ensemble decision trees that incorporate random sampling for bagging training instances and input variables thereby reducing the predictive variance without increasing the bias it creates an output by measuring the average of each ensemble member s predictions and exhibits resilient performance even with noisy input variables sikorska senoner and quilty 2021 a crucial aspect of rf is that it offers an estimate of the input variable relevance that may be utilized to select influential input variables it is a non parametric and non linear modeling technique with high predictive capacity reduced admissible outliers noise tolerance and easy exclusion of over fitting problems as indicated earlier the rf can theoretically solve nonlinearity and can outline in streamflow reconstruction to increase accuracy li et al 2019 to explain our next research question whether post processing techniques improve the streamflow outputs from the hybrid modeling simulations an optimization based nudge scheme was introduced and tested as a post processing technique with the best obtained hybrid model sesf in the current study recent literature has coupled phm and dds into a hybrid model konapala et al 2020 ni et al 2020 for streamflow simulations to mutually minimize the errors within the phm and dds more recently sikorska senoner and quilty 2021 developed an ensemble based streamflow simulation where a dd model is used to simulate an ensemble from the phm as in the case of sesf of the current study none of them has adopted an optimization technique in these hybrid models to improve the model s predicting capability to higher efficacy we found that implementing a post processing analysis to the developed hybrid model by integrating pre processed meteorological variables and post processed gcm simulated streamflow will further enhance the results to replicate with the reference data table 4 accurately our results showed the substantial benefits of integrating multiple variables streamflow here which can be further validated by other research findings ursulak and coulibaly 2021 zhang et al 2020 this is plausible considering that one model could compensate for the other model s streamflow deficiencies the research findings related to the streamflows generated under the combined impact of cc and lulc indicated a decrease in monthly and seasonal streamflow by 2040 the results obtained in this study are in line with the previous studies bisht et al 2020 sinha et al 2020b that demonstrated declining future streamflow patterns in different basins of india particularly in the western ghats the reduced flow can cause more frequent hydrological droughts in the future and can adversely affect the environment and ecology decreased flow in summer and winter tends to lose hydrological resilience and coherence usman et al 2021 and may cause groundwater depletion the projected decrease in discharge from the varahi river basin also indicates water shortages which can significantly impact agriculture sinha et al 2020b and enhance water restrictions and wildfires venkatesh et al 2020a as shown in this study the reduced river flow in the varahi basin is expected to decline the opportunities for local communities the productivity of freshwater habitats and advanced organisms that depend on river water shetty et al 2015 in addition although changes in river flow may be due to climatic variability and frequent droughts uttarwar et al 2020 the water demand for agriculture and households raises thereby increasing the consumption of groundwater and surface waters thus the decline in streamflow at the basin under combined lulc and cc hinders agricultural productivity ecology freshwater habitats reservoir operations and stakeholders and therefore deserves particular consideration in evaluating water security schyns et al 2019 furthermore the warming atmosphere enhances evaporation and develops dry surfaces making water scarcity more severe mukherjee et al 2018 venkatesh et al 2022 concerning the current study it is also necessary to highlight its limitations compared to station data across india imd gridded data effectively identifies precipitation however the gridded data creation and interpolation procedure might have introduced some uncertainty kolluru and kolluru 2021 the selection of more gcms and their coarser resolution will further affect the in depth analysis of streamflow variations at a regional scale limited data of observed streamflow hinders training efficiency which further affects the testing results even though we successfully integrated phm and dd further developments in hybrid models can be made by implementing deep learning and land surface models in addition physics based loss functions or hydrological principles such as the budyko hypothesis and hybrid model training could be employed to ensure that the simulation is scientifically consistent with known streamflow generation mechanisms konapala et al 2020 furthermore incorporating soil moisture evapotranspiration and reservoir operations could generate a more reliable streamflow output sazib et al 2020 which is not considered in the present study the use of ipcc ar6 models instead of cmip5 could have generated better model predictions as they might have reduced model deviations which we consider a future scope of the study 5 conclusions a novel optimization based nudging scheme for post processing the hybrid model simulated streamflow has been proposed in the current study it consists of integrating phm and dd output through two sets of approaches in approach 1 pesf dd models are used to ensemble meteorological variables and then use them in a phm and in approach 2 dd models are used to correct phm derived residuals thus a mutual polishing of output either from pre ensemble of meteorological variables or post ensemble of streamflow is considered to take advantage of both phm and dd in other words dd models are used to rectify model residuals errors derived from gcm predicted meteorological variables or phm generated streamflow simulations this framework is practical because it respects hydrological processes through the phm and takes advantage of the dds ability to simulate the complex relationship between residuals and input variables sesf performed better in simulating streamflow than pesf as it adds the extra information not acquired by the phm to simulate ensemble streamflow using dd the swat phm model adopted in the study exhibited an excellent model performance with an r2 nse and pbias of 0 82 0 79 8 23 during calibration and an r2 nse and pbias of 0 85 0 66 19 37 during validation respectively out of six dd models rf exhibited the best performance for predicting the phm residuals that required less user intervention in selecting appropriate inputs to the dd model the optimization based integrated streamflow outperformed all individual gcm simulated streamflows and ensemble stream flows with better model fit statistics r2 and nse of 0 69 and 0 66 the output obtained through the nudging scheme was further utilized for streamflow predictions with the combined impact of cc and lulc under rcp 4 5 it depicted a decrease in monthly and seasonal streamflow we found declining stream flows during winter summer and monsoon 22 65 31 77 11 81 and further an annual reduction of 22 08 this decline in streamflow at the basin hinders agricultural productivity ecology freshwater habitats and stakeholders and therefore deserves consideration in evaluating water security insights from this study may aid decisions and policymakers in proactive and sustainable water resources management future studies could test i these hybrids models in discrete climatic catchments and at large spatial scales ii the performance of these hybrid models using cmip6 data which could generate better results as the model deviation is reduced in cmip6 iii for uncertainty using probability distribution functions error metrics and monte carlo simulations and iv the applicability of deep learning models in conjunction with hydrological models to

7872,study region varahi river originating from the western ghats of india study focus we developed a hybrid model that integrates process based hydrological model phm and data driven dd techniques to generate streamflow simulations precisely the hybrid modeling framework is practical as it respects hydrological processes through the phm while considering the advantage of the dd model s ability to simulate the complex relationship between residuals and input variables further we have proposed an optimization based nudging scheme for post processing the hybrid model simulated streamflow to overcome the limitations in phm and dd new hydrological insights for the region we formulated two approaches for simulating streamflow ensembles using dd and phm models in approach 1 dd models are initially used to ensemble meteorological variables and then use the ensembles in a phm to simulate streamflows in approach 2 phm is forced with different sets of meteorological variables to simulate multiple streamflow sets and then use dd models to ensemble the phm derived streamflows random forest exhibited better performance for ensembling precipitation temperature and streamflow datasets compared to the other five dd algorithms in the study streamflows generated using approach 2 showed reliable estimates when compared against observed streamflow values however post processing the hybrid streamflows using an optimization based nudging scheme outperformed the streamflows generated in approach 1 and approach 2 with better model fit statistics r2 and nse of 0 69 and 0 66 the output from the nudging scheme was further utilized for streamflow predictions under the combined impact of land use cover lulc and climate change cc under the representative concentration pathway 4 5 scenario it depicted a decrease in monthly and seasonal stream flows with 22 65 31 77 11 81 for winter summer and monsoon seasons respectively these results suggest that water availability will decline and water scarcity will increase in the study region these variations in streamflow might negatively impact agriculture and natural ecosystems and even lead to water restrictions in the region graphical abstract ga1 keywords data driven techniques ensemble global circulation model nudging process based model streamflow simulation data availability data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request 1 introduction accurate and reliable simulation of streamflow and analyzing its sensitivity to various man made natural and climatic aspects has been a notion of research for many decades konapala et al 2020 previously researchers have used process based hydrological models phm to examine hydrological processes in a catchment kolluru et al 2020a 2020b however data driven dd techniques with efficient computational ability proved to be powerful tools for modeling complex non linear behaviors abda et al 2022 nearing et al 2021 while phms that precisely characterize the hydrological processes can be considered a standard coupling them with dd models can serve as a robust methodology for simulating realistic water balance components abda et al 2022 sharannya et al 2021 researchers have been applying various phms to understand the catchment behavior in the rainfall runoff relationship for decades these phms were tested on various basins to explore this heterogenous time space varying complex relationship mani et al 2020 sharannya et al 2018 modeling rainfall runoff relationships through phms requires modeling potential interactions between meteorological surface and subsurface characteristics it is often complicated leading to uncertainties and poor streamflow simulations hence state of the art dd models were introduced in hydrology to avoid uncertainties and to simulate reliable streamflow estimates using satellite reanalysis global circulation model gcm precipitation datasets gharbia et al 2022 liu et al 2022 ni et al 2020 though dd models exhibited promising results in various studies long term data requirements and lack of process representation often led to spurious and inaccurate simulations these inaccurate simulations occur mainly when the simulations are beyond the data range used for dd model training and testing kolluru et al 2020b read et al 2019 to overcome the limitations imposed by a single model hybrid models phm dd were developed and tested in some basins to supplement each other in their respective strengths and limitations boucher et al 2020 xu et al 2022 while the phms confidently capture the energy and water balance based on the underlying physical laws dd models can capture these processes efficiently using a training dataset without considering the physical laws of the hydrological model konapala et al 2020 previous studies incorporating this hybrid modeling behavior exhibited better performance in simulating streamflows abda et al 2022 gharbia et al 2022 alizadeh et al 2020 used a hybrid feature selection strategy employing the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator lasso and particle swarm optimization artificial neural networks pso ann to predict streamflows accurately at the karaj river in iran abda et al 2022 proposed rainfall runoff models based on machine learning to forecast daily streamflows in the oued sebaou watershed northern algeria he used historical data of streamflow and rainfall amounts as input for random forest rf artificial neural networks ann and local weighted linear regression lwlr similarly adnan et al 2021 used the locally weighted learning lwl algorithm to anticipate streamflow by combining it with additive regression ar bagging bg dagging dg random subspace rs and rotation forest models their results suggested that the ensemble lwl ar technique effectively simulated the streamflow additionally li et al 2019 employed numerous dd models for effectively forecasting daily streamflow including support vector regression svr backpropagation neural network bpnn rf and extreme learning machine with kernels elm kernel furthermore yang et al 2020 proposed a hybrid model combining process based and dd hydrological models for rainfall runoff simulation in data scarce watersheds they offered three methods to enhance the predictive power of machine learning based hydrological models a synthetic dataset was used to assess the learning behavior of the process based distributed hydrological model and observed data was used to examine the model s predictive power kilinc and haznedar 2022 suggested a hybrid approach including long short term memory lstm networks and a genetic algorithm ga to estimate streamflow they have used daily flow data to compare the performance of the benchmark model with the hybrid model berbić et al 2022 used three supervised learning models to model mean monthly flow nearest neighbor nnm method support vector machine svm and ann two optimization algorithms ga and simulated annealing sa were used to optimize the selection of parameters and the trustworthy set of input variables essenfelder and giupponi 2020 proposed a coupled machine learning hydrologic modeling method to simulate inter basin water transfer iwt flow contributions in the absence of observational data they used machine learning techniques to effectively replicate the decision making process of iwts and the hydrologic model to simulate the rainfall runoff process of a watershed xu et al 2022 proved that long term hydrological simulations could be generated when deep learning models convolutional neural network cnn and lstm are combined with semi distributed hydrological model soil and water assessment tool swat furthermore liu et al 2022 coupled meteorological forecasts from a land surface hydrological model and a machine learning model to simulate hourly streamflows over a cascading reservoir catchment in southwest china kolluru and kolluru 2021 have proposed and tested pre and post integration of satellite precipitation products to efficiently predict drought using dd algorithms over india they proved that pre integration of precipitation datasets using dd algorithms predicted drought more accurately than post integration of precipitation datasets literature incorporating hybrid models was concentrated on arid and humid basins and research on mountainous tropical basins was scarce modeling flows in tropical basins is challenging as most models fail to predict simulate the peak flows with basins having an average annual rainfall of 3500 mm though hybrid models enhance the predictions the training data from previous decades might not predict the current meteorological trends in the basins further the historical and future climate data obtained from gcms are coarse and are subjective to more bias limiting their application over regional basins di virgilio et al 2020 furthermore the literature mentioned above used dd models or phms separately or in combination to predict the streamflow however none of them adopted post processing techniques on the hybrid model outputs to further increase the capability of streamflow predictions by eliminating their residuals this motivated us to develop and test a new framework by applying optimization based nudging as a post processing technique to improve the hybrid phm dd model based ensemble streamflow simulations previous studies have used the nudging technique to solve the mismatch between surface and root zone soil moisture measured from field based and remote sensing derived soil moisture loizu et al 2018 mazzoleni et al 2018 have used a nudging scheme to assimilate stream flow into a muskingum routing scheme in a spatially lumped or distributed hydrological model furthermore ciabatta et al 2015 kolluru and kolluru 2021 and massari et al 2014 have used this nudging technique to integrate two precipitation datasets these studies assumed the nudging term k value to be constant whereas the k value in the classical assimilation technique may vary in time while the proposed methodology is applied to a tropical basin in india it can be generalized to any study dealing with climate change or any basin with measured streamflow records our study is framed to test 1 whether pre ensemble of meteorological precipitation and temperature data or post ensemble of streamflow from multiple simulations improves the streamflow predictions 2 which dd algorithm can effectively ensemble precipitation and streamflow data 3 whether post processing techniques improve the streamflow output from the hybrid modeling simulations to test these objectives we have considered 5 gcms from ipcc 5 future climatic data for 1951 2040 we have employed semi distributed soil and water assessment tool swat phm for simulating streamflow six dd algorithms random forest rf bayesian regularized neural network brnn generalized linear model glm gradient boosting model gbm k nearest neighbors k nn and cubist differ in their structure and modeling behavior were considered for precipitation temperature and streamflow dataset ensembles we have further incorporated an optimization based nudging scheme for post processing the hybrid model simulated streamflow for accurately representing the basin runoff the developed framework was tested in a tropical basin varahi of western ghats india the analysis was further extended to understand 1 the impacts of land use land cover lulc and climate change cc on streamflow patterns and 2 the basin s future seasonal and monthly streamflow trends 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the western ghats wg is the mountainous region along india s west coast stretching along the coast for around 2300 km they are essential in moderating indian tropical monsoon systems with their characteristic forest habitats mudbhatkal and amai 2018 they are spread over 100 200 kilometers from the seacoast across the indian states of gujarat maharashtra and karnataka the varahi river is one of the west flowing rivers originating from the high peaks of the western ghats at a place called hebbagilu at a mean sea level of 716 m with an area of 813 km2 jayasree and venkatsh 2012 the catchment is managed by the central water commission the government of india in haladi the west coast comprises a coastal plain with crops and a lateral plateau that dominates the basin s middle area whereas a thick forest in western ghats hilly areas fig 1 the average annual rainfall over the area is around 3753 mm the temperature is between 19 3 and 29 8 c and is characterized by a humid and tropical environment 2 2 data used the hydrological model requires meteorological data to define the weather inputs rainfall maximum and minimum temperature tmax and tmin data at a daily time step was obtained from gauge based gridded data developed by the india meteorological department imd which was considered as a standard reference these gridded data with a spatial resolution of 0 25 were downloaded from 1951 to 2018 for calibrating and validating phm stream flow data from 1986 to 2018 daily was procured from the central water commission india digital elevation model dem for catchment delineation was downloaded from national remote sensing centre http www nrsc gov in land use maps were derived from landsat imagery and soil data were collected from the national bureau of soil survey nbss india to define the catchment characteristics data from five bias corrected gcms were used to evaluate future projected climatic trends these five gcms were selected based on previous research that tested the efficiency of these gcms in simulating the streamflow effectively sinha et al 2020a swain et al 2020 the five gcms under representative concentration pathway rcp 4 5 and 8 5 emission scenarios representing average and extreme greenhouse gas emission scenarios usman et al 2021 were bias corrected using a quantile based mapping technique to limit the uncertainty kannan and ghosh 2013 salvi et al 2013 the gcms used were bnu esm of beijing climate center gcm1 canesm2 of canadian centre for

scientifique gcm3 mpi esm lr gcm4 and mpi esm mr gcm5 of max planck institute for meteorology 2 3 ensemble of streamflow in the current study two approaches precipitation ensemble streamflow i e pesf and streamflow ensemble streamflow i e sesf are proposed to simulate reliable streamflow estimates as shown in fig 2 the first approach involves ensembling precipitation and temperature datasets from five gcms using dd techniques and further simulating streamflows pesf using phm in contrast the second approach uses each gcm to generate streamflow using phm these streamflows from five different gcm based inputs are ensembled using dd techniques to generate sesf a temporal sub setting approach was implemented to carry out the approaches by dividing total precipitation temperature and streamflow datasets for training and testing the dd models during the calibration and validation stages continuous precipitation data was utilized for training and testing the dd models during calibration and validation stages to cover the low and extreme rainfall events that transpire over non monsoon summer and monsoon seasons all the gcm grids are at the same grid location of the observed dataset imd with a 0 25 spatial grid resolution and monthly temporal resolution to establish homogenous raster geometry the two approaches and the adopted combinations are discussed below 2 3 1 approach 1 in approach 1 pesf initially 68 years 1951 2018 of precipitation and temperature datasets were segregated for calibration 1951 2008 and validation 1974 2018 phases the overlapping period for calibration and validation is selected to accommodate a sufficient number of years for training and testing the dd models the calibration data which spans from 1951 to 2008 was further segregated into two groups with 35 years 1951 1985 of data for training dd techniques and the remaining 23 years 1986 2008 of data for testing ensembled products pre ensemble of meteorological variable during the validation phase 35 years of data from 1974 to 2008 was used for training and ten years from 2009 to 2018 were employed for testing the dd techniques furthermore the ensembled precipitation data from these gcms using six dd techniques were compared with the observed precipitation data imd the best performed model output from these six dd models was selected for further simulating the streamflow using phm the simulated streamflow pesf with the best performed dd model ensembled precipitation input is compared against the observed streamflow finally the output of pesf will be compared with the streamflow generated using approach 2 sesf to choose the best approach that can accurately simulate the streamflow of a basin 2 3 2 approach 2 to implement the second approach initially the streamflow was simulated using phm i e the swat model by forcing the model with each gcms precipitation and temperature data of 68 years 1951 2018 further a temporal sub setting approach like approach 1 was adopted for the output of phm the streamflows simulated using the swat model were divided into two groups with 35 years 1951 1985 of streamflow data for training and the remaining 23 years 1986 2008 of streamflow data for testing the dd model during the calibration stage during validation 35 years of streamflow data 1974 to 2008 was used for training and ten years of streamflow data 2009 to 2018 was employed for testing the dd model the streamflow output from different gcm based precipitation and temperature inputs were integrated post ensemble of streamflow using the six dd techniques for generating sesf data the six ensembled streamflow results from six dd model outputs were compared with observed streamflow to identify the best dd model and are further compared with approach 1 to identify the best approach that can accurately replicate a basin s streamflow patterns the proposed two approaches will help understand whether the streamflow should be simulated through a pre ensemble of meteorological variables or a post ensemble of streamflow datasets that can accurately capture the actual pattern of observed stream flows furthermore the two approaches will help examine the behavior and capability of dd techniques to simulate datasets that can reasonably match the observed datasets of precipitation and streamflow overall to carry out these two approaches first precipitation and temperature values are extracted at each grid cell for 68 years second dd techniques were applied to ensemble the best precipitation first approach or streamflow second approach values trained using observed data as predictors third the trained dd techniques were further employed to predict the daily rainfall and streamflow values with the left over data in both calibration and validation stages over the study area finally the output from dd techniques is used to simulate the streamflow using phm 2 4 process based model the process based semi distributed model i e soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 has been widely used in assessing the impact of climate change on water balance components in the past two decades mani et al 2020 the applications of the swat model include examining the potential impacts of land use management and climate change on hydrology and water resources assessment of watershed response to land cover land use changes on the annual water balance and temporal runoff dynamics guevara ochoa et al 2020 and testing the model in different climatic catchments venkatesh et al 2020b the swat model is intended to compute and route water sediments and contaminants from the individual drainage units sub basins to their outlets throughout the river basin the swat model was supplied with the dem lulc map and the nbss soil map the model was calibrated and validated with swat calibration and uncertainty programs swat cup using the sequential uncertainty fitting sufi 2 algorithm that implements the latin hypercube procedure against the daily runoff data from 1986 to 2008 and 2009 2018 for the study area we used percent bias pbias coefficient of determination r2 and the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse to examine the model performance the criteria suggested by moriasi et al 2015 were used for evaluating the model performance 2 5 data driven models in this study precipitation and streamflow datasets were ensembled and predicted using six dd models employing two approaches as the objective of the current study is to ascertain the accurate dd techniques to integrate different precipitation pre ensemble of meteorological variables or streamflow datasets post integration of streamflow all models were trained and tested by implementing cross validation and hyperparameter tuning the details of the hyperparameter values and cross validation techniques were presented in a supplementary file for reference supplementary table s1 the hyperparameters were optimized to obtain a better fit with rmse as the test statistic a sample figure supplementary fig s1 was represented in a supplementary file depicting the role of hyperparameter optimization to achieve better accuracy lower rmse the six dd techniques implemented in the current study are 2 5 1 random forest rf rf is a robust ensemble classifier that uses decision trees to generate predictions breiman 2001 wagle et al 2020 rf regression technique uses multiple trees for predictions based on random bootstrapped samples of the input dataset the model employs randomly selected sections of training data sets for each tree the algorithm uses two thirds of the data to run random binary trees with bootstrapping approach with the rest eliminated from the bag or called out of bag oob the importance of predictor variables can be assessed by analyzing the oob error between different trees with root mean square error as a statistic kolluru et al 2021a with the number of trees concerning the number of inputs the model eliminates overfit in decision trees increasing accuracy 2 5 2 bayesian regularized neural network brnn bayesian regularization is a non linear mathematical procedure that turns a well positioned statistical issue into ridge regression brnn is more resilient and can minimize long cross validation requirements than regular backpropagation networks kolluru et al 2021b standard neural networks have trouble determining the number of hidden neurons which might hinder the learning process either in excess or low brnns trained with effective network parameters or weights implement the bayes theorem into the regularization scheme to prevent overfitting this is considerably smaller than the number of weights in a standard fully connected backpropagation neural network which can be challenging to stop if over trained sariev and germano 2020 2 5 3 generalized linear model glm the notion of a widely recognized linear regression model is extended by a generalized linear model glm it introduces a link function around the linear combination of the explanatory variable abdulkabir et al 2015 it consists of three components i a random component which refers to the probability distribution of the response variable ii a linear predictor that is a linear function of regressors and iii a linearizing link function that is smooth and inverted which converts the expectation of response variable to the linear predictor 2 5 4 gradient boosting model gbm gbm is a decision tree based dd model that incorporates boosting techniques to enhance model performance boosting is a statistical technique that combines the efforts of several weaker models to produce a robust model by reducing the mean squared error mse of all the models schapire 2003 an inefficient model is defined as a learner with slightly better performance than random guessing the final predictions are developed in an additive forward propagation where a new learner is attached at every node reducing the negative gradient by least squares the residuals of the past model are further employed as an input for the next model learner allowing the model to learn and enhance from the errors of the past models hastie et al 2001 2 5 5 k nearest neighbors knn knn is the simplest non parametric dd model that does not make any prior assumptions regarding the probability distribution of input data knn generates the predictions by considering the weighted mean of k nearest neighbors developed based on the inverse of their distances the present work implements the fitcknn function to establish the knn model with dependent options euclidean distance and a single neighbor option are addressed in knn for regression fit between observed precipitation and gcm datasets kolluru and kolluru 2021 2 5 6 cubist cubist is a rule based algorithm that allocates class membership through recursive partitioning input variables into similar subclasses or trees quinlan 1993 each tree develops an endpoint leaf that contains a linear regression model for prediction in the conceptual cubist regression model the cubist approach generates several rules at each tree as if after after that overlap with each other if the covariate set meets the criteria defined by the rules the model in question is utilized to determine the value predicted cubists can also develop sub models that consist of committee members associated with a set of rules kuhn et al 2017 each committee member under a sub model generates a prediction and all these predictions are averaged to generate the outcome 2 6 post processing using nudging based optimization nudging based optimization is introduced to curtail the limitation of pesf and sesf and to improve the streamflow simulations a new framework has been developed to improve the hybrid phm dd model based ensemble streamflow simulations using optimization based nudging as a post processing technique nudging is a dynamic relaxation process that matches the output of a model to observations for data assimilation in conventional data assimilation theory nudging involves adding a gain term k in this study to a parameter measured derived to enhance model performance kolluru et al 2020a we used an optimization approach to reduce the error between modeled and observed streamflow and to identify the nudging coefficient k the integration between two datasets pesf sesf was carried out by employing the local optimization fmincon function kolluru et al 2020a a basic nudging scheme is formulated in eq 1 to integrate these two variables 1 s int t s p ⅇ sf t k s sesf t s pesf t where sint is the integrated streamflow product spesf and ssesf are streamflow estimates from pesf and sesf k is a variable with a similar role in the classical data assimilation method in the kalman filter ciabatta et al 2015 a calibration strategy is adopted to find the value of k by optimizing the root mean square error rmse between observed and integrated products the k value varies between 0 and 1 where the higher the value the greater the weight given to pesf and the lower weight to sesf this integration technique s concept is comparable to the advanced bayesian model averaging and inverse error square averaging these techniques use diverse prediction abilities of different models by giving greater weights to better model performance and lower weights to poorer predictions more information about the algorithm can be found in ciabatta et al 2015 kolluru and kolluru 2021 massari et al 2014 mazzoleni et al 2018 2 7 combined impact of cc and lulc on streamflow a river basin experiences lulc and climate change simultaneously exerting a combined impact on streamflow to understand this combined impact the improved streamflow simulations from the optimization based nudging scheme were adopted for a future period 2021 2040 under rcp 4 5 with lulc of 2030 future lulc was predicted using the dynamic conversion of land use and its effects dyna clue model dyna clue is a versatile and generic structure that supports regional scale applications one of the main features of the dyna clue model is its elasticity for each lu type which makes it reluctant to to convert a specific land use type to another various investigations have used the dyna clue model to justify the model s applicability behera and behera 2020 3 results 3 1 evaluation of discrete gcm precipitation and temperature products against imd data the statistical metrics computed using 68 years of daily rainfall maximum temperature tmax and minimum temperature tmin data from each gcm against imd data are represented in table 1 gcm1 i e bnu performed slightly better than other gcms however all models failed to capture the precipitation and temperature patterns concerning imd datasets furthermore the statistical values table 1 portray the poor skill of gcm to predict precipitation than tmax and tmin each climate model differs in the physical laws governing the climate system hence they might have exhibited mixed results one climate model may prove efficient in some regions or seasons whereas the other may perform better in another location and season to tackle these differences performing an ensemble might yield the most efficient model output a basic ensemble technique i e a normal algebraic average was performed on the gcms which depicted a better performance than individual gcms table 1 the r2 nse and rmse of the normal algebraic precipitation average compared against imd are 0 34 0 33 21 20 during calibration and 0 39 0 38 and 21 89 during validation respectively tmax and tmin showed an r2 nse and rmse of 0 65 0 64 1 51 and 0 62 0 56 and 1 46 respectively during calibration during the validation period tmax and tmin exhibited an r2 nse and pbias of 0 66 0 65 1 52 and 0 60 0 45 and 1 60 respectively dd techniques were adopted to improve these meteorological variable results further and compare them against the observed data model performance for dd models is represented in table 2 it can be observed that all six dd models performed better than individual gcm output cubist showed poor results out of six dd models whereas random forest rf performed much better than other models the rf model has an r2 nse and rmse of 0 51 0 51 18 06 and 0 55 0 54 and 18 79 respectively during calibration and validation for precipitation which depicts its higher capability for replicating the variables the rf model performed superior to other dd models in predicting maximum and minimum temperatures with r2 of 0 66 nse of 0 65 pbias of 1 49 for tmax and r2 of 0 63 nse of 0 60 and pbias of 1 39 for tmin during calibration during validation the rf model exhibited an r2 nse and rmse of 0 67 0 67 1 49 for tmax and an r2 nse and rmse of 0 63 0 62 and 1 34 for tmin respectively 3 2 calibration and validation of swat model the swat model simulations were performed with the standard parameters and are calibrated with the sufi 2 algorithm under swat cup the model generated 30 sub basins and 608 hydrological response units hrus a series of iterations were performed to match the simulated results with the observed data the best fitted values of the most sensitive parameters during calibration were utilized without alteration during the validation stage the haladi gauging station the outlet of the study area was used to calibrate streamflow of 33 years of recorded data 23 years 1986 2008 were considered for calibration and ten years 2009 2018 for validation at a daily time step the r2 nse and pbias during calibration are 0 82 0 79 and 8 23 whereas the r2 nse and pbias during the validation period are 0 85 0 66 and 19 37 respectively these statistics indicate a good model performance for monthly streamflow simulations moriasi et al 2015 sharannya et al 2016 sinha et al 2020a table 3 lists the sensitive parameters with their minimum maximum and fitted values used for calibration all the r2 and nse values for the streamflow simulations are greater than 0 75 and the pbias values are in the range of 20 for both calibration and validation periods suggesting good model performance table 3 according to moriasi et al 2015 furthermore the statistics and ranking of the sensitive parameters used in calibrating the swat model are listed in table 3 the most sensitive parameters for streamflow are scs runoff curve number cn followed by the groundwater delay gw delay threshold depth of water in the shallow aquifer required for return flow to occur gwqmn groundwater revap coefficient gw revap saturated hydraulic conductivity sol k plant uptake compensation factor epco and other parameters table 3 3 3 performance assessment of swat hybrid models and nudging scheme in simulating streamflows table 4 illustrates the model performance under individual gcm based swat streamflow output among the five gcm based inputs the gcm4 esm lr based swat model simulated more accurate stream flows r2 0 65 nse 0 56 pbias 39 87 though esm lr depicted good performance selecting a single gcm has been repeatedly recognized as the primary cause of uncertainty in gcm selection reshmidevi and nagesh kumar 2014 hence multiple gcms are considered input into phm or dd models to overcome the uncertainty instead of adopting a single gcm furthermore finalizing these model accuracies and simulations based on either phm or dd model has been repeatedly recognized as the primary contributor to the overall uncertainty in its assessments and selection hence the hybrid models phm dd were developed and tested in the basin to overcome the uncertainties and limitations imposed due to the stand alone model based streamflow output the hybrid models add strength and complement the limitations to simulate precise model output the hybrid models were developed by employing two approaches pesf and sesf as described in section 2 3 it can be observed from table 4 that pesf and sesf generated streamflows more efficiently than individual gcms r2 nse and pbias for pesf are 0 61 0 57 39 56 and sesf are 0 62 0 58 39 17 respectively though hybrid models resulted in improved streamflow simulations compared to individual models rf performed better than all other dd models hence it is considered the best performed technique in the sesf phase among the two approaches sesf rf exhibited better performance with an r2 of 0 62 nse of 0 58 and pbias of 39 17 than pesf this implied that post ensemble results could depict better performance than pre ensemble using dd techniques the superiority of post ensemble model results might be because the stream flows simulated by phm are used to tune dd models to establish reference streamflow in the pre ensembling phase the dd models were trained with temperature and precipitation data to establish reference meteorological data and later used to simulate stream flows using phm fig 3 depicts the line plot for the stream flows cumecs generated using different approaches from 1986 to 2018 stream flows simulated using imd rainfall and temperature are denoted as imdsf it can be observed from the figure that pesf underestimates the low flows that occur in the early stages of a year and sesf overestimates the peak flow which appears during the middle phase of a year of analysis a new framework was proposed and implemented by applying optimization based nudging as a post processing technique to improve the hybrid phm dd model based ensemble streamflow simulations nudging based optimization is mainly introduced to curtail the limitation of pesf and sesf and improve the streamflow simulations the capability of nudging based optimization to establish the reference streamflow nudgesf against observed streamflow can be observed in table 4 the optimization based integrated streamflow outperformed all individual gcm based simulated streamflow and ensemble stream flows acceptable and satisfactory correlation coefficients and nse 0 69 and 0 66 were observed between observed and simulated stream flows though the pbias value 35 09 is not acceptable the streamflow simulations generated using the integrated technique were improved indicating the technique s efficiency in merging datasets since these findings demonstrate nudging systems capability to enhance streamflow simulations testing integration techniques in other basins are further recommended future studies employing this method should consider various meteorological datasets to verify the precision of the optimization approach in simulating stream flows and its efficiency as a post processing technique 3 4 cc lulc results genuine insight into the reasons for the streamflow variation can be provided only through the combined influence of climate change and lulc changes rather than considering them individually therefore the best simulated streamflow i e nudgesf was further utilized to understand the combined impact of lulc and climate change on streamflow patterns and to comprehend future seasonal and monthly streamflow trends in the basin the best fitted value for the sensitive parameters obtained from the swat cup table 3 was used to simulate future streamflows from 2020 to 2040 the lulc for the year 2030 was predicted using the dyna clue model and was provided as input for the swat model to predict the streamflow under the combined lulc and climate scenario the lulc maps for the years 2003 historical period and 2030 future period are illustrated in fig 1 the changes in various lulc types of the varahi river basin are calculated and presented in table 5 it was perceived that the agricultural land increased by 9 71 with a decrease in the forest area of 3 6 catchment experienced reduced barren land 5 8 and an increase in the urban area 0 2 the primary land conversion is from forest to agriculture agriculture to urban and water body to barren these are in line with the observations of sinha et al 2020a 2020b fig 4 illustrates the spider chart depicting monthly variations in historical and future stream flows cumecs these flows were generated using the nudging technique under the combined cc and lulc scenarios it could be examined from fig 4 that in the future period under the combined impact of cc and lulc there is a decrease in streamflow the reduction of future streamflow pertained to decreased rainfall and barren land in the catchment fig 5 represents the percentage change in seasonal streamflow a higher decline in streamflow was observed during the summer 31 78 than in the monsoon 11 81 it can be observed that the streamflow declined by 22 65 during winter and had an overall decline in annual streamflow of 22 08 proper irrigation and water supply schedules should be adopted to curtail the streamflow depletion in the study area for sustainable land and water management operations 4 discussion our study findings demonstrate that different strategies or approaches can be utilized and adopted under discrete catchment areas to improve the streamflow simulations previous studies mudbhatkal et al 2017 sinha et al 2020a predicted and simulated streamflows using single or multiple gcms kim et al 2016 asserted that the uncertainties in gcms emanate from the initial and lateral boundary conditions schemes for parameterization carbon cycle representation and inadequate insights into the climate theory ahmed et al 2020 suggested that the generation of the dd model ensemble is one of the most widely adopted approaches for reducing the uncertainty arising from gcm recently a study by sikorska senoner and quilty 2021 suggested using phm in conjunction with dd to establish a good output quality hence in the present study a hybrid model phm and dd is employed that combines the advantages of a phm intended to respect physical connections between hydrological processes with the capabilities of the dd model which can model complex relationships between input and target variables addressing our first research question whether pre ensemble of gcm data pesf or post ensemble of streamflow sesf from multiple simulations improves the streamflow predictions we found that the post ensemble of streamflow resulted in a better performance than the pre ensemble of meteorological data this could be due to the usage of phm simulated streamflow by dd models to establish the reference flow during the post processing phase dd models can effectively develop links between input and target using a training dataset without considering the physical laws of the hydrological model in the case of pesf a dd model s input and target are gcm and imd precipitation and temperature though pesf improves the accuracy of the meteorological variables i e gcms using dd models the accuracy depends on a particular gcm in predicting precipitation and temperature the low competencies of gcms in simulating precipitation compared to tmax and tmin are commonly described in the literature ahmed et al 2020 flato et al 2013 reported that using thermodynamic balance makes gcms predictions more efficient in representing temperature than precipitation simulations achieved by simple parameterization through predicting actual processes in the case of sesf the input and target of the dd model are the streamflows generated using individual gcms and reference streamflow thus the dd tries to establish statistical links between these target and input variables using a training dataset without including any classic hydrological modeling behaviors the results align with sikorska senoner and quilty 2021 highlighting the importance of improving the accuracy of streamflow simulations using dd models the phm generated output transfers the information about the reference and simulated streamflow acquired through calibrated phm parameters to the dd models adding the additional information not apprehended by the phm to simulate ensemble streamflow thus the sesf can overcome specific issues of the pesf addressing our second question which dd algorithm can effectively ensemble the precipitation and streamflow data we found that rf performed efficiently though all six dd models improved the hydro meteorological predictions rf outperformed other dd models which is consistent with the previous research results abda et al 2022 ahmed et al 2020 that accentuated the efficiency of rf in generating the streamflow efficiently rf is a group of ensemble decision trees that incorporate random sampling for bagging training instances and input variables thereby reducing the predictive variance without increasing the bias it creates an output by measuring the average of each ensemble member s predictions and exhibits resilient performance even with noisy input variables sikorska senoner and quilty 2021 a crucial aspect of rf is that it offers an estimate of the input variable relevance that may be utilized to select influential input variables it is a non parametric and non linear modeling technique with high predictive capacity reduced admissible outliers noise tolerance and easy exclusion of over fitting problems as indicated earlier the rf can theoretically solve nonlinearity and can outline in streamflow reconstruction to increase accuracy li et al 2019 to explain our next research question whether post processing techniques improve the streamflow outputs from the hybrid modeling simulations an optimization based nudge scheme was introduced and tested as a post processing technique with the best obtained hybrid model sesf in the current study recent literature has coupled phm and dds into a hybrid model konapala et al 2020 ni et al 2020 for streamflow simulations to mutually minimize the errors within the phm and dds more recently sikorska senoner and quilty 2021 developed an ensemble based streamflow simulation where a dd model is used to simulate an ensemble from the phm as in the case of sesf of the current study none of them has adopted an optimization technique in these hybrid models to improve the model s predicting capability to higher efficacy we found that implementing a post processing analysis to the developed hybrid model by integrating pre processed meteorological variables and post processed gcm simulated streamflow will further enhance the results to replicate with the reference data table 4 accurately our results showed the substantial benefits of integrating multiple variables streamflow here which can be further validated by other research findings ursulak and coulibaly 2021 zhang et al 2020 this is plausible considering that one model could compensate for the other model s streamflow deficiencies the research findings related to the streamflows generated under the combined impact of cc and lulc indicated a decrease in monthly and seasonal streamflow by 2040 the results obtained in this study are in line with the previous studies bisht et al 2020 sinha et al 2020b that demonstrated declining future streamflow patterns in different basins of india particularly in the western ghats the reduced flow can cause more frequent hydrological droughts in the future and can adversely affect the environment and ecology decreased flow in summer and winter tends to lose hydrological resilience and coherence usman et al 2021 and may cause groundwater depletion the projected decrease in discharge from the varahi river basin also indicates water shortages which can significantly impact agriculture sinha et al 2020b and enhance water restrictions and wildfires venkatesh et al 2020a as shown in this study the reduced river flow in the varahi basin is expected to decline the opportunities for local communities the productivity of freshwater habitats and advanced organisms that depend on river water shetty et al 2015 in addition although changes in river flow may be due to climatic variability and frequent droughts uttarwar et al 2020 the water demand for agriculture and households raises thereby increasing the consumption of groundwater and surface waters thus the decline in streamflow at the basin under combined lulc and cc hinders agricultural productivity ecology freshwater habitats reservoir operations and stakeholders and therefore deserves particular consideration in evaluating water security schyns et al 2019 furthermore the warming atmosphere enhances evaporation and develops dry surfaces making water scarcity more severe mukherjee et al 2018 venkatesh et al 2022 concerning the current study it is also necessary to highlight its limitations compared to station data across india imd gridded data effectively identifies precipitation however the gridded data creation and interpolation procedure might have introduced some uncertainty kolluru and kolluru 2021 the selection of more gcms and their coarser resolution will further affect the in depth analysis of streamflow variations at a regional scale limited data of observed streamflow hinders training efficiency which further affects the testing results even though we successfully integrated phm and dd further developments in hybrid models can be made by implementing deep learning and land surface models in addition physics based loss functions or hydrological principles such as the budyko hypothesis and hybrid model training could be employed to ensure that the simulation is scientifically consistent with known streamflow generation mechanisms konapala et al 2020 furthermore incorporating soil moisture evapotranspiration and reservoir operations could generate a more reliable streamflow output sazib et al 2020 which is not considered in the present study the use of ipcc ar6 models instead of cmip5 could have generated better model predictions as they might have reduced model deviations which we consider a future scope of the study 5 conclusions a novel optimization based nudging scheme for post processing the hybrid model simulated streamflow has been proposed in the current study it consists of integrating phm and dd output through two sets of approaches in approach 1 pesf dd models are used to ensemble meteorological variables and then use them in a phm and in approach 2 dd models are used to correct phm derived residuals thus a mutual polishing of output either from pre ensemble of meteorological variables or post ensemble of streamflow is considered to take advantage of both phm and dd in other words dd models are used to rectify model residuals errors derived from gcm predicted meteorological variables or phm generated streamflow simulations this framework is practical because it respects hydrological processes through the phm and takes advantage of the dds ability to simulate the complex relationship between residuals and input variables sesf performed better in simulating streamflow than pesf as it adds the extra information not acquired by the phm to simulate ensemble streamflow using dd the swat phm model adopted in the study exhibited an excellent model performance with an r2 nse and pbias of 0 82 0 79 8 23 during calibration and an r2 nse and pbias of 0 85 0 66 19 37 during validation respectively out of six dd models rf exhibited the best performance for predicting the phm residuals that required less user intervention in selecting appropriate inputs to the dd model the optimization based integrated streamflow outperformed all individual gcm simulated streamflows and ensemble stream flows with better model fit statistics r2 and nse of 0 69 and 0 66 the output obtained through the nudging scheme was further utilized for streamflow predictions with the combined impact of cc and lulc under rcp 4 5 it depicted a decrease in monthly and seasonal streamflow we found declining stream flows during winter summer and monsoon 22 65 31 77 11 81 and further an annual reduction of 22 08 this decline in streamflow at the basin hinders agricultural productivity ecology freshwater habitats and stakeholders and therefore deserves consideration in evaluating water security insights from this study may aid decisions and policymakers in proactive and sustainable water resources management future studies could test i these hybrids models in discrete climatic catchments and at large spatial scales ii the performance of these hybrid models using cmip6 data which could generate better results as the model deviation is reduced in cmip6 iii for uncertainty using probability distribution functions error metrics and monte carlo simulations and iv the applicability of deep learning models in conjunction with hydrological models to

7873,study region the southern san joaquin valley ssjv california four representative soil types were evaluated study focus evaluation of regional scale hydrology and nitrogen n fate and transport requires a robust modeling framework that considers critical local scale environmental conditions and crop root zone physical processes two widely used yet conceptually and mechanistically different models hydrus 2d 3d and swat soil and water assessment tool were used to investigate water and n dynamics in processing tomato fields across a range of soil types and management scenarios over a 30 year period in the ssjv new hydrological insights for the region this study implements a framework to evaluate a regional scale model against a field scale model and provides a framework for assessing percolation and n transport results from regional scale simulations in the absence of extensive field observations field scale models developed in hydrus 2d 3d produced similar results to a regional scale swat model in four specific soils in terms of responses to percolation and n losses as a function of varying n fertilizer and irrigation management practices this model to model agreement at the local scale provides confidence in region scale hydrological and n fate and transport findings particularly in the absence of extensive field observations both models suggest that promoting conservation practices targeting the optimization of irrigation and fertilizer n management would have a large impact in protecting regional groundwater quality graphical abstract ga1 keywords

mg l nitrate n burton 2018 fram 2017 nolan et al 2015 lockhart et al 2013 ward et al 2018 to address the problem of nitrate leaching from agricultural lands the state of california has developed several regulatory plans and programs such as the irrigated lands regulatory program ilrp 2019 and the central valley wide salt and nitrate management plan cv salts snmp 2016 groundwater quality management plans for threatened areas require that coalitions demonstrate that protective practices are being implemented in addition the sustainable groundwater management act sgma was passed in 2014 groundwater basins are categorized according to their risk of overdraft and local groundwater sustainability agencies develop plans that protect future groundwater quantity and quality harter 2020 these processes require innovative monitoring and assessment of the effects of management practices on groundwater quality growers and their coalitions are looking to models like swat and hydrus to help them meet their regulation obligations n in excess of crop uptake has the potential to pollute the environment and contribute to climate change zhang et al 2021 to mitigate nitrate leaching it is critical to understand the difference between applied and removed n in agroecosystems it is an important indicator for sustainability of agricultural productivity and soil and environmental quality

volatilization lateral flow and leaching past the root zone irrigation and n fertilizer application rates and timings are two major crop management practices that strongly influence fate and transport

uptake castro bustamante and hartz 2015 farneselli et al 2015 lazcano et al 2015 with its unique landscape and mediterranean climate california is the largest agricultural producer and exporter in usa generating upwards of 50 1 billion gross revenue in 2019 cdfa 2020 processing tomatoes are among the top 10 crops in terms of production and revenue representing 96 of us domestic production and 30 of global supply winans et al 2020 fresno and kings counties in the san joaquin valley combined produce 47 2 of the state s processing tomato tonnage and produce some of the highest yields averaging 118 000 kg ha cdfa 2020 mechanization as well as improved varieties and production practices have all contributed to the success of this crop geisseler and horwath 2013 hanson and may 2006a in the past two decades large scale adoption of subsurface drip irrigation sdi has further helped boost productivity based on the yield potential of the field and variety typical n application ranges from 207 to 314 kg n ha and crop water demand ranges from 610 to 737 mm hartz 2017 these ranges illustrate that no single fertilizer or irrigation regime fits every field s requirement given the spatial heterogeneity of climate edaphic conditions and yield potential however with the increasing regulatory pressure on growers to improve n use efficiency it is important to accurately estimate fertilizer n requirements to minimize the risk of nitrate leaching geisseler et al 2020 mahmud et al 2021 field measurements of different components of the n cycle present a variety of challenges including high levels of spatial and temporal variation of solute transport and n leaching beyond the root zone in agricultural fields cherry et al 2008 field level mass balance calculations marsh 2019 2016 root and vadose zone monitoring baram et al 2016 farneselli et al 2018 turkeltaub et al 2016 lysimeter experiments knappe et al 2002 wang et al 2012 and models with different levels of complexity are some of the available tools to assess the n budget in cropping systems kurtzman et al 2013 the field level mass balance approach evaluates n inputs and outputs in a defined time period and can include measurements of soil mineral n pre planting and post harvest n inputs to the system and n in plant biomass and harvested materials cherry et al 2008 often with this method all unaccounted n is considered leached though n may be lost along other less commonly measured pathways such as gaseous losses or immobilization in organic matter root zone monitoring methods include the use of suction lysimeters that measure small areas and hence require a large number of measurement points to monitor a single field green et al 2008 ramos and kücke 2001 weighing lysimeters are a direct and reliable method for quantifying nutrient leaching in agricultural ecosystems knappe et al 2002 wang et al 2012 however their construction and maintenance is difficult and costly models represent a fast and cost effective option for estimating the different n budget components in an agroecosystem nolan et al 2010 several studies defterdarović et al 2021 epelde et al 2015 franqueville et al 2018 gärdenäs et al 2005 nolan et al 2010 turkeltaub et al 2018 used models to simulate the n cycle of a cropping system and demonstrated the utility of models as decision support tools to mitigate impacts of surplus n in agroecosystems examples of such models are the soil water assessment tool swat and hydrus which are widely used to predict nitrate leaching through root zones swat is the result of roughly 45 years of research and development work led by usda agricultural research services ars and scientists from various institutions gassman et al 2007 it was developed by combining three prominent models from the 1980 s namely creams chemical runoff and erosion from agricultural systems gleams groundwater loading effects on agricultural management system and epic erosion productivity impact calculator swat is a spatially distributed watershed scale hydrological model with a plant growth sub model that simulates leaf area development biomass accumulation water and nutrient uptake and crop yield for different plant species and cover types as such swat captures the influence of crop growth on both hydrology and nutrient cycling nair et al 2011 to accurately represent agricultural watersheds hydrus 2d 3d is a fully two and three dimensional variably saturated water flow and solute and heat transport model the hydrus 2d 3d software package is the result of collaborative research and development work led by the usda ars salinity laboratory uc riverside pc progress and the international groundwater modeling center mccray 2007 šimůnek et al 2008 the graphical user interface streamlines the definition and creation of the required finite element mesh as well as initial and boundary condition input files the numerical solution of the richards equation for multi dimensional problems makes hydrus a widely used tool for plot and field scale simulation of irrigation as well as reactive n transport and leaching doltra and mun 2010 eltarabily et al 2019 hardie et al 2018 karandish and šimůnek 2017 phogat et al 2014 ramos et al 2012 often models based on the richards equation e g hydrus 2d 3d šimůnek et al 2016 swap van dam et al 2008 rzwqm2 ma et al 2012 are applied to simulate transport at the pedon or field scale while process based semi empirical models are more suited for landscape scale applications cherry et al 2008 however research questions related to groundwater flow and its solute content span the field and watershed scales and thus warrant examination with both types of models vogel 2019 while processes such as agricultural management practices are local their effects and related policies operate at the watershed scale in the irrigated agricultural landscape it may take years for a measurable response of nitrate contamination in groundwater and such observations are often difficult to relate to a source emanating from a specific time and place and therefore to a specific agricultural practice on the land surface the novelty of this study lies in the comparison of two conceptually different models swat and hydrus 2d 3d which have policy implications these models were used to simulate processing tomatoes one of the predominant crops in the ssjv and the california s central valley under four different management scenarios across four regionally representative soil types the objectives of this study were to 1 develop swat and hydrus 2d 3d models with identical climatic soil and agricultural management information and 2 assess the combined effects of irrigation and n management practices on n losses with the two models for a range of soil types in the san joaquin valley of california 2 methods 2 1 study area the southern san joaquin valley ssjv has mostly deep heterogeneous alluvial soils that range in texture from sand to clay and are mostly well drained fig 1 the mediterranean climate with hot dry summers with maximum average temperature between 32 and 37 average precipitation of 165 290 mm year and average reference evapotranspiration eto of 1471 mm year is favorable for growing processing tomatoes processing tomatoes in this area are transplanted from late january through early june depending on weather conditions and are mechanically harvested from late june through october after harvest remaining non harvested biomass is incorporated into the soil and the planting beds are built for the next year with most fields remaining fallow during the winter crop rotation with other annual crops is a common management practice however there is no standard for which crops rotate and how many years of tomato are planted before a rotation is cropped nor how tomato management practices may be adjusted in response to potential rotational effects for this initial model comparison the crop rotation were not modeled with neither model in this study 2 2 swat model inputs and setup a swat model was built for the entire ssjv domain fig 1 a 30 meter dem digital elevation model raster from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm farr et al 2007 was used to create stream networks and delineate the basin and sub watersheds the smallest spatial unit at which swat performs process based simulations is called the hydrological response unit hru the hru is composed of a unique combination of soil land use and slope within the sub watershed a detailed and accurate representation of soil physical and chemical properties is crucial for accurate simulations of plant soil water nutrient dynamics swat requires information on soil texture rock fragments bulk density organic carbon available water content and saturated hydraulic conductivity soil information was obtained from the national cooperative soil survey soil characterization database and usda nrcs ssurgo soil survey geographic soils layer saturated hydraulic conductivity values were calculated from pedotransfer functions described in saxton and rawls 2006 based on soil texture bulk density and soil organic carbon vertically swat discretizes the root zone into a user defined number of soil layers here selected to be 4 9 10 and 7 layers for soils a b c and d respectively according to ssurgo database discretization land use information came from 2014 california department of water resources dwr land cover dataset allowing for the identification of fields under processing tomato and other land uses dwr 2016 swat requires daily information on solar radiation relative humidity wind speed air temperature and precipitation to simulate physical processes related to plant growth evapotranspiration et nutrient uptake and cycling and the water cycle these climate variables were collected from weather stations operated under cimis california irrigation management information system program swat assigns each sub watershed climate information from the weather station that is nearest to its centroid the weather data was qa qc d to identify invalid data and missing values and was prepped for the range of years simulated i e 1985 2015 four processing tomato hrus were identified with a range of different soil mapping units one each in the a b c and d hydrologic soil groups with soil a wasco series being a well drained sandy loam soil b excelsior and c westhaven moderately well drained loams and sandy loams respectively and soil d tulare a poorly drained silty clay fig 1 table s1 supporting information these hru s served as the basis for this study and for the development of the hydrus 2d 3d models the soil conservation service scs curve number procedure was used with the daily curve number calculated as a function of soil moisture content neitsch et al 2011 fertilizer and irrigation management practices are discussed in section 2 4 and were constant throughout the simulation period swat model simulations were executed for years 1985 2015 with a warm up period of 5 years 1985 1989 all inputs to the model including weather soil and crop management information were identical for both swat and hydrus 2d 3d models for the 4 selected hrus 2 2 1 swat model root zone water and n processes swat simulates major components of water nitrogen and phosphorous cycles n and p and allows for customization and calibration of these various processes to tailor simulations to a given set of conditions and improve model accuracy the plant available water content awc is defined in eq 1 as a function of the water content at field capacity fc and the water content at the wilting point wp all in units of length l the wp is calculated as a function of the clay content m c the bulk density ρ b g cm3 and a conversion factor eq 2 1 awc fc wp 2 wp 0 4 m c ρ b 100 these parameters are calculated for each soil layer and water is assumed to be uniformly distributed in the horizontal dimensions of the hru at every time step one day in this case after all fluxes have been accounted for to adjust water content water content higher than the fc is available to percolate vertically or to flow laterally out of each layer the actual water depth percolating from layer to layer is calculated as a function of the available water for percolation and travel time for percolation tt perc which is unique for each soil layer and is calculated as shown in eq 3 3 tt perc sat fc k sat where sat is the saturated water content l and k sat is the saturated hydraulic conductivity l t root water uptake and evaporation are distributed with depth across layers before computing percolation in each time step given the inherent uncertainty associated with site specific conditions across the swat modeling domain a number of conservative measures were taken with respect to root zone n processes to avoid potential systematic underestimation of nitrate losses below the root zone as a result estimations of n losses from swat and hydrus 2d 3d can be considered conservative under the modeled conditions in this study and may in some cases reflect overestimations n losses presented in this study were calculated as leaching from swat and as fluxes across the lower boundary condition in hydrus 2d 3d we hypothesized that these fluxes probably include some n amounts from processes assumed to be negligible in this study and therefore call them n losses the n cycle is simulated in swat as mineral gaseous and organic pools neitsch et al 2011 fig 2 users can select from default organic and inorganic fertilizer types or customize their own that vary in terms of their elemental n nitrate n ammoniacal n and organic n contents for this study all n was applied as elemental n which is rapidly converted to nitrate n and prohibits ammonia volatilization which would otherwise occur if ammoniacal fertilizers were used ammonia volatilization was ignored in this study for swat and hydrus 2d 3d to remain conservative in regards to nitrate losses estimates and because rates are mostly negligible in this cropping system where fertilizer is applied dissolved in the irrigation water via sub surface drip irrigation krauter et al 2006 in swat denitrification is a function of substrate concentration i e organic carbon and nitrate moisture content and soil temperature and can be calibrated with two parameters sdnco and cdn the former defines the moisture content threshold for which the denitrification begins while the latter is a process rate adjustment factor for this study the model was parameterized such that denitrification was negligible consistent with the hydrus 2d 3d setup while denitrification occurs in actual fields a synthesis by verhoeven et al 2017 found that average annual n2o emissions from processing tomato in california was about 1 98 kg ha 1 which included studies with furrow irrigation that tend to promote anaerobic conditions that favor denitrification viers et al 2012 estimated a 10 denitrification and volatilization of total applied n but this factor was used for all types of irrigation in the study area in california including furrow and sprinkler irrigation therefore it is not likely that total denitrification exceeds more than a few percent of n applied in the sub surface drip irrigated systems simulated in this study meaning it is often a relatively minor n budget component though some differences may exist in reality across soil types for example heavier textured soils like soil d may exhibit higher denitrification rates than coarser textured soils as such the current modeling approach is conservative in regards to nitrate losses results particularly in soil d swat simulates three different pools of soil organic n 1 fresh plant residue n 2 active organic n and 3 stable organic n which are a function of residue inputs and soil information organic n pools can accumulate or deplete depending on residue inputs decomposition rates soil water content soil temperature tillage and other soil parameters the model parameter cmn controls the rate at which active organic n is converted to the stable organic n pool with the default value set to 0 0003 for this study this value was adjusted to 0 00045 to promote residue decomposition and avoid relatively large accumulations in soil organic n that were observed during preliminary simulations using the default value data from de clerk et al 2003 suggest that in aggregate row cropping systems in california and cropping systems in the ssjv did not lead to statistically significant increases in total n in soil samples they assessed spanning approximately 60 years furthermore data from the university of california davis century experiment field sites show that conventionally managed tomato corn and tomato wheat cropping systems did not lead to increases in total soil n on average between 1993 and 2012 wolf et al 2018 atmospheric deposition of n was assumed to be negligible for this study as the estimated n deposition would be in the 1 range from other inputs viers et al 2012 2 2 2 swat model sensitivity analysis and calibration swat simulates crop growth and maturation as a function of solar radiation heat unit accumulation and water and nutrient availability and uptake there are 36 crop model parameters in swat that control the magnitude and timing of various crop processes including canopy and root development biomass accumulation yield as well as transpiration and nutrient uptake swat contains a database of more than 130 crop models however the existing crop specific parameters describing crop growth and productivity have often been developed in production environments that are different from and often less productive than california this necessitated modification of these parameters to represent typical california field conditions management practices and yield levels a global sensitivity analysis was performed with the sequential uncertainty fitting version 2 sufi2 algorithm abbaspour et al 2018 2007 available in swat cup swat calibration and uncertainty programs to evaluate the sensitivity of evapotranspiration and yield to crop model parameters tables 1 and 2 respectively using the ssqr objective function i e the sum of squares of the difference of the measured and simulated values after ranking in both cases crop model and soil parameters were varied across each of the four hrus included in this study the parameter sensitivity is computed by multiple linear regression systems 4 g α i 1 m β i bi where g is the objective function b is the parameter α is the regression constant β corresponds to the technical coefficient attached to the variable b and m is equal to the number of parameters the crop model parameters included in the sensitivity analysis in addition to bn1 bn2 and bn3 i e the optimal fraction of n in biomass at emergence 50 maturity and maturity respectively and heat units required to reach maturity were the main focus of manual calibration of the crop model soil parameters included in the analysis were the available water capacity and saturated hydraulic conductivity of the top soil layer where depths depend on each soil type table s1 processing tomato yield data used for calibration were collected from county agricultural commissioner reports for counties in the study area from 2010 to 2020 national agricultural statistics service accessed in june 2021 monthly actual evapotranspiration data used in the objective function was taken from a satellite based et estimation dataset paul et al 2018 parameters were manually calibrated in an iterative process at the landscape scale considering available literature and local knowledge a landscape scale manual crop model calibration approach was required because of the spatial and temporal complexity of cropping systems in this region which is not adequately characterized for any one crop in any one region across a sufficient period of time to allow for a site specific i e field level calibration approach in lieu of such data achieving representative landscape level dynamics of crop processes ensures that the suite of physical root zone processes captured for any one field are reasonably realistic default and calibrated values of crop growth parameters for processing tomato are given in table 3 2 3 hydrus 2d 3d model parameter choice and model application are described in section 2 3 1 unsaturated water flow in an isotropic medium was simulated with the hydrus 2d 3d

fertilizer was diluted in the irrigation water as urea ammonium and nitrate 1 2 and 3 respectively urea and nitrate were simulated only in the dissolved form while ammonium was considered in the adsorbed form as well solute uptake via transpiration was considered for nitrate and ammonium mineralization was considered in the top 30 cm of soil as a zero order reaction 6 θ c 1 t x i θ d ij c 1 x

density and water contents at 33 and 1500 kpa obtained from the database developed for the swat simulations were used as inputs for the rosetta3 pedotransfer function zhang and schaap 2017 soil hydraulic parameters of the van genuchten mualem model van genuchten 1980 and their associated errors were estimated table 1 supporting information the uncertainty about the estimated parameters was also provided by the pedotransfer function and was included in the simulations by performing a monte carlo based uncertainty analysis due to computational constraints only the most influential parameters described by skaggs et al 2013 were included namely saturated hydraulic conductivity k s an empirical shape parameter n and the dispersivity λ in this two dimensional case λ has longitudinal and transverse components respectively λl and λt as defined in šimůnek et al 2011 one hundred and fifty parameter combinations were sampled using the latin hypercube technique simlab 2 2 software saltelli 2004 assuming a log normal distribution for k s and n as given in rosetta3 with a different mean and standard deviation for each soil layer table s1 supporting information and a uniform distribution for the λl and λt with values between 5 and 15 cm for λl with λt 0 1 λl all soil layers were assumed to have the same dispersivity values the simulations with a range of values for the parameters k s λl and λt comprise not only the uncertainty that the pedotransfer functions bring with them but also include some of the uncertainty that would arise if the parameters were to be measured at different scales pachepsky and hill 2017 hydrus 2d 3d model variability resulting from the hydraulic parameter sensitivity analysis was measured as the coefficient of variation eq 11

uptake were considered and defined in eq 12 as p a mg day 1 for each solute time and location the maximum ammonium and nitrate concentrations allowed in the water removed from the flow region by root water uptake are defined as croot mg cm 3 in eq 13 table 4 and was calculated using measured n uptake rate dynamics over the season as reported in the literature t k hartz 2017 hartz and bottoms 2009

time and location nup is the daily n uptake mg day 1 and t is daily actual transpiration cm3 day 1 n mineralization was considered as a zero order reaction in a 30 cm depth range near the top of the soil profile with ammonium as the daughter product the 30 cm range for n mineralization was effectively 45 cm below the top of the growing bed and 15 cm below the lowest part of the topsoil profile the furrow zero order coefficients of n mineralization were manually calibrated for each soil table 4 so that total annual n mineralization would be in the range described by geisseler et al 2019 for similar ssjv soils 76 123 kg ha 1 both mineralization rates and max n uptake definitions were used to manually calibrate the model against experimental values from the literature the premise is that if both annual n uptake and mineralization rates are within measured ranges then the n losses differences that would be observed between hydrus 2d 3d and swat simulations are due to differences between the models flow transport uptake or other processes rather than other factors related to model inputs or outputs 2 3 2 domain properties for each modeled hru a specific 2d mesh was defined according to the varying soil layers and their distinct soil textures fig 4 profile depth ranged between 152 and 160 cm according to the profile information in the soil database developed for the swat simulations profile width was set to 75 cm assuming plant spacing of 150 cm fig 5 following hanson et al 2008 for soils a b c and d sandy loam loam silty loam and silty clay respectively figs 1 4 4000 2341 1829 and 2182 nodes were defined resulting in 7762 4512 3485 and 4189 2d elements respectively averaging on the order of 1 4 cm2 in size the differences in water contents at a pressure head of 400 cm for the modeled profiles are explained by the varying soil textures showing that soils a and d are more homogeneous than b and c fig 4 a meshline was defined at a depth of 150 cm where the water and n fluxes out of the root zone were recorded for all soil profiles sub surface drip irrigation emitters were represented as a half circle with a 1 1 cm radius at a 30 cm depth for all soil profiles in a 2d mesh with a finer mesh discretization around the dripper fig 5 the root density distribution was defined using the vrugt model vrugt et al 2001 with a maximum root depth of 150 cm depth of maximum intensity of 50 cm a shape parameter pz at 2 cm a maximum rooting radius of 75 cm and the radius of maximum intensity at 0 cm located where the plant is and px at 1 cm fig 5 the feddes water uptake reduction model feddes et al 1978 was considered with h 1 h 2 h 3 max h 3 min h 4 values of 1 2 800 1500 and 8000 cm respectively as described in hanson et al 2006 and a critical stress index of 0 8 assumed to allow for compensated root water uptake no solute stress model was included in the simulation and overall no water uptake reduction due to low water content or salinity was expected since irrigation was scheduled to be sufficient in volume and performed with low salinity water 2 3 3 initial and boundary conditions the boundary condition at the dripper was defined as a variable flux allowing for intermittent irrigation the topsoil was defined as an atmospheric boundary condition the lower end of the profile as free drainage and the rest of the domain boundary was defined as no flow fig 5 the hcrita parameter defined as the absolute value of the minimum allowed pressure head at the soil surface was set at the default value of 10000 cm fertilizer was applied in the form of urea nitrate and ammonium in the respective proportions 50 25 and 25 representing a common practice in central valley conventional processing tomatoes production irrigation and fertilizer amounts are described in section 2 4 model setup included a 5 year warm up period followed by 25 years of actual simulation atmospheric boundary conditions including et0 and precipitation were identical to that used in swat etc defined as et0 kc where kc is a crop coefficient was partitioned by assuming all of it to be considered as root water uptake in hydrus 2d 3d during the cropping season sdi is considered to have minimal soil water evaporation while all et0 was considered as potential soil water evaporation in between cropping seasons potential evaporation in between crop seasons was then reduced by the model according to the available water at the upper boundary crop coefficients were defined as in snyder et al 2007 for tomatoes 0 3 for the first 25 of the season a linear increase until the 50 of the season reaching 1 1 1 1 until 80 of the season and then a linear decrease to 0 65 at the end of the season 2 4 irrigation and fertigation management practices both swat and hydrus 2d 3d were simulated under the same management scenarios to evaluate the effects of management practices on percolation and n losses across soil and climate types in all simulations model runs retained consistent annually based management practices over the 25 year timeframe and no adjustments were made based on climate year type soil nitrate content or other factors this approach is not intended to imply or reflect actual long term land management but to provide insight into how each modeling unit in each scenario performs across the range of climatic variability that occurred throughout the 25 year simulation period a suite of management practices i e planting and harvest dates n fertilization and irrigation rates and timing and tillage were determined to reflect a relatively efficient and productive processing tomato cropping system based on uc cooperative extension recommendations and common practices implemented in the study area nitrogen management practices including application rate and timing were developed from three main sources 1 grower reported n application rate information from 2016 for 0 7 million hectares in 12 central valley water quality coalitions 2 crop production budgets developed by uc agricultural economists uc farm advisors and cooperating growers turini et al 2018 these budgets comprehensively list all major management activities typical of the geographical area of interest and 3 extensive consultation with uc extension specialists and farm advisors and other industry experts fertilizer applications were modeled as a single pre plant application and as fertigation events during the growing season fig 6 similarly irrigation practices including irrigation timing and volume were developed to match common practices in the studied area in both models drip irrigation was simulated and irrigation timing reflected the pattern of seasonal eta and the method of irrigation the resulting baseline scenario consists of 230 kg ha 1yr 1 n applied over 7 applications and 605 mm ha 1yr 1 applied over 38 irrigation events fig 6 this was the scenario used in the calibration with both models three additional management scenarios were developed utilizing different combinations of n rate and irrigation depth fig 6 under the same scheduling as the baseline scenario the remaining scenarios depicted higher n application n 265 kg ha 1yr 1 higher irrigation i 716 mm year 1 or both ni it should be noted that while the n i and ni scenarios apply higher input rates than the baseline they are also representative of common practices implemented in the study area 2 5 statistical analysis lin s concordance correlation coefficient ρ c as defined in eq 14 lin 2000 1989 was used to assess the agreement of the two models this coefficient allows comparison of the correlation between the models to a 45⁰ line that passes through the origin ρ c will range from 1 1 where a value of 1 means a perfect agreement between the models 0 represents no agreement and 1 a perfect disagreement cut off values for ρ c can be defined as good 0 8 moderate 0 65 0 8 and poor 0 65 agreement mcbride 2005 14 ρ c 1 2 σ 12 σ 1 2 σ 2 2 μ 1 μ 2 2 where μ 1 and μ 2 are the means of each model 1 and 2 in this case hydrus 2d 3d and swat respectively σ 1 2 and σ 2 2 are the variances of 1 and 2 and σ 12 is the covariance ρ c was calculated for each soil and scenario during the entire simulation on an annual basis 25 data points and also for the four simulated soils for each scenario 100 data points 3 results 3 1 swat and hydrus 2d 3d comparison to experimental ranges in literature the average in season et from swat model was 562 mm whereas it was 551 mm from hydrus 2d 3d the scatter plot of seasonal et from hydrus 2d 3d and swat shows a high degree of agreement with a ρ c value of 0 71 fig 7a though fallow period and total annual et were less correlated fig 7b these values agree with field studies hanson and may 2006b and remote sensing based eta measurements paul et al 2018 showing seasonal eta range of 450 600 mm for processing tomatoes the off season evaporation averaged 114 and 158 mm for swat and hydrus respectively with consistently higher evaporation values for hydrus 2d 3d values across all soils and years fig 7 b crop yield simulated in swat ranged from roughly 76 218 to 170 369 kg ha 1 and averaged 130 019 kg ha 1 across all soils under the baseline scenario while the 10 year average 2011 2020 for fresno kings and kern counties was roughly 116 569 kg ha 1 nass accessed october 2021 as mentioned swat crop growth calibration was intended to reflect fields with robust above average productivity meaning the calibration was adequate in this regard hydrus 2d 3d does not simulate crop yields n mineralization was simulated in hydrus 2d 3d as a zero order process and rate coefficients were manually calibrated for each soil eq 7 table 4 this resulted in annual n mineralization rates ranging between 86 and 116 kg n ha 1 averaged across the four soils fig 8 due to this approach coarser textured soils required higher rate coefficients than finer textured soils to achieve similar annual values table 4 n mineralization had a higher inter annual variability in swat relative to hydrus 2d 3d fig 8 demonstrating that swat s physically based model of n mineralization captures environmental effects that are not reflected in by the zero order kinetics assumed in hydrus 2d 3d runs in swat the four soils averaged between 63 and 130 kg ha 1yr 1 with soils a b and c in the lower end range for processing tomatoes reported in geisseler 2019 soil d a silty clay is relatively high in soil organic matter with carbon contents ranging from 1 05 to 2 54 resulting in higher n mineralization in swat there was a positive correlation ρ c 0 41 in the mineralization estimates from the two models fig 8 the mechanism for simulating n uptake differs between the two models with hydrus 2d 3d calculating the process by multiplying the water uptake at a specific node by the mineral n concentration at that node swat calculates n uptake demand as a fraction of the accumulated biomass with biomass determined by a crop growth function yet annual n uptake values were similar between the models with hydrus 2d 3d and swat averaging 282 and 285 kg ha 1 across soils respectively with relatively strong positive correlations ρ c 0 72 across the four soils and overall table 7 fig 9 when comparing the simulations to expected experimental values hartz 2017 both models underestimated the n uptake in some years generally in the same years agreement between the models decreased for years where swat n uptake was higher than the experimental range presented in hartz 2017 this was due to to the croot value imposed in hydrus 2d 3d which limited the maximum n uptake other data such as geisseler et al 2020 report n uptake values to have a linear relationship with n application and uptake as high as 378 kg ha 1 in plots fertilized with 300 kg n ha 1 suggesting potential substantial luxury consumption by this crop 3 2 hydrus 2d 3d and swat sensitivity analysis hydrus 2d 3d sensitivity to selected hydraulic and transport parameters was studied for the 25 year average baseline model outputs coefficients of variation cvs were calculated for 150 simulations performed for each soil nitrogen losses and water percolation had the highest cvs for the finer textured soil d silty clay and were lower in the range of 0 07 0 14 in the coarser soils table 5 nitrogen uptake et and root water uptake t had very low sensitivity to the selected hydraulic and transport parameters this suggests that the variability found in the n losses and percolation is directly tied to soil processes and is not a result of changes in the water or n uptake swat et was sensitive to crop model parameters related to leaf area development and decline across all four soils bold in table 1 though not to maximum canopy height r chtmx the maximum rooting depth parameter r rdmx influenced et in soils b and c though not a and d of the soil parameters tested the available water content of the top layer affected et in all four soils while only soil d exhibited sensitivity to saturated hydraulic conductivity of the top layer soil depth had no effect across the range tested crop yield in swat was sensitive to crop model parameters related to crop maturation t t base r frgrw1 temperature stress r t opt light interception r blai radiation use efficiency bio e maximum rooting depth and harvest index table 2 modeled n concentration in the yield r cnyld only affected total crop yield over the simulation period in soil b this sensitivity is due the reliance of subsequent crops on n mineralized from the previous year s residues when cnyield is increased and more n removed from the system less n is available for plant uptake for the next crop which triggers n stress and yield reduction conversely when less n is removed in yield additional n is available for uptake which triggered marginal increases in yield regarding soil parameters yield was sensitive to available water content in the upper layer in soils a b and c though not d soil depth had no effect in the range tested 3 3 irrigation and fertigation scenarios 3 3 1 water balance et was comparable for both models across all soils with differences largely coming from the handling of evaporation from the soil in the fallow season figs 7 10 there was interannual et variability due to changes in precipitation and eto there was little difference in et under the n i and ni scenarios compared to the baseline suggesting that in neither model were crops stressed by lack of water or n for soils a b c and d hydrus 2d 3d simulated 49 59 35 and 5 mm more average eta than swat respectively lin s concordance correlation coefficients calculated for each soil and scenario during the entire simulation for et were nearly constant across all scenarios table 6 runoff was negligible in swat ranging between 1 and 4 of water inputs on average across soils and was zero for all soils and scenarios in hydrus 2d 3d despite the differences between the water flow models in hydrus 2d 3d and swat percolation beyond the root zone was in good agreement between the two models for each soil and scenario fig 11 table 6 the on average lower percolation rates in hydrus 2d 3d relative to swat fig 10 in the coarser soils a and b were due to the systematically higher et in hydrus 2d 3d fig 10 the n scenario caused no change in percolation relative to the baseline scenario while the i and ni scenarios resulted in the same increased percolation for all soils in both models in scenarios with additional irrigation hydrus 2d 3d produced higher percolation relative to its baseline in the coarser textured soils a 103 and b 148 and compared to swat 78 and 98 though swat absolute values were larger figs 11 13 both models responded similarly in soil c 105 and swat simulating relatively more percolation in heavier textured soil d 275 compared to hydrus 2d 3d 200 fig 13 as with et lin s concordance correlation coefficients for percolation were almost constant across scenarios table 6 detailed mass balance components for all soils and scenarios for both hydrus and swat can be found in the supporting information figs s1 and s2 respectively 3 3 2 nitrogen balance n uptake was moderately well correlated between hydrus 2d 3d and swat in most soils and scenarios besides soil d that showed a poor correlation also each showed differences across scenarios differences in soil d are attributed to the n root availability with depth due to mineralization in the entire profile and the positive feedback of higher fertilizer higher biomass and therefore and increase in the mineralization in the next season due to higher plant residues in swat in the n scenario both hydrus 2d 3d and swat simulated higher n uptake relative to the baseline due to more n in the rootzone ranging from 10 to 12 and 14 20 respectively with swat runs showing the greatest n uptake in soil d 405 kg ha 1 fig 12 furthermore the hydrus 2d 3d models averaged uptake of nearly all of the additional 35 kg ha 1 of fertilizer n with n uptake increases ranging from 30 to 36 kg ha 1 with swat the n scenario caused positive feedback between n uptake and n mineralization of crop residues in the i scenario both models took up less n relative to the baseline by roughly 10 15 due to increased percolation and reduced n residence time in the root zone n uptake was within 5 of the baseline under the ni scenario for both models with swat simulating minor increases and hydrus 2d 3d simulating minor decreases swat crop yields were impacted by n uptake with n showing a 3 6 increase i showing a 4 7 decrease and the ni showing a 0 2 increase n mineralization was relatively constant across scenarios in hydrus 2d 3d since soil water content remained relatively consistent compared to the baseline due to soil drainage however values varied in swat due to the effects of n uptake and subsequent crop residue decomposition under the n scenario n mineralization increased by 29 36 relative to the baseline while under the i scenario it decreased by 14 20 and under the ni scenario it decreased by 3 10 under the simulated conditions swat predicted storage of organic n in the stable organic n pool a sn in swat in each scenario for soils a b and c but only in the n scenario for soil d for other scenarios soil d exhibited a net depletion of soil organic n reserves via n mineralization furthermore through a mass balance calculation considering n uptake n removed in yield and residue n conversion to nitrate and active organic n f mn in swat it is shown that a fraction of crop residue n is not broken down on average across the simulation period across all soils and scenarios the sum of these two organic n storage pathways i e stable organic n and crop residue n ranged from 7 to 17 kg n ha 1 year 1 on average across scenarios similar to n mineralization organic n storage was highest in the n scenario for all soils due to increased n uptake biomass production and crop residue n while the i scenario resulted in the lowest accumulation due to reduced residue n inputs the baseline and ni scenario were comparable and averaged approximately 11 kg n ha 1year 1 of storage in both cases across soils for the baseline scenario swat and hydrus 2d 3d n losses results across all soils were 28 swat mean 19 swat median 53 hydrus mean and 33 hydrus median kg ha 1 year 1 with moderate agreement when compared on an annual basis the differences are partly explained by lower n mineralization estimates and n movement into soil organic n storage in swat lin s concordance coefficients were higher for the finer textured d soils for n losses in all the scenarios table 7 nitrate losses agreement between the models varied with soil and scenario and while the baseline and n scenarios had good moderate and poor agreement depending on soil type all soils had poor agreement under the i and ni scenarios table 7 both models responded to climatic differences within the simulation period specifically high precipitation years 1995 1998 data not shown produced higher percolation and n losses with both models n losses increased more with hydrus 2d 3d than with swat furthermore somewhat normal to drier conditions led to accumulations of leachable n in the soil profile in both models as is suggested by median annual losses values being lower than the mean trends in mineral n storage in soil water or on sorption sites were in the same range for both models and there was no clear pattern of one model storing more mineral n than the other data not shown regardless most accumulated n was eventually leached by percolation in both models illustrating that the 5 year warm up was sufficient to initiate the models and that the 25 year simulation period captured the longer term fate of n under the n scenario both models increased n losses though swat showed a greater increase relative to its baseline than did hydrus 2d 3d fig 14 this is because hydrus 2d 3d took up nearly all of the additional n leaving little extra to leach relative to the baseline fig 13 furthermore all of the plant n is removed from the system with harvest in hydrus 2d 3d whereas crop residues remain and decay in swat allowing for subsequent mineralization which can eventually contribute to n losses in the i scenario both models showed greater n losses relative to baselines though hydrus 2d 3d increased more 71 107 than swat 33 89 fig 14 this is partly due to the difference in how each model handles the soil physical processes and is compounded by differences in n mineralization while hydrus 2d 3d simulates relatively constant n mineralization year after year the lower n mineralization in swat due to less crop n uptake resulted in less leachable mineral n under the ni scenario both models showed the greatest n losses furthermore the increase in losses relative to the baseline was very similar with hydrus 2d 3d and swat increasing between 86 and 126 and 91 208 respectively fig 14 relative to the baseline n losses in the i scenario increased about 15 19 in hydrus 2d 3d for swat increases in losses were comparable in the n and i scenario though the combination ni triggered the largest response fig 14 these differences further illustrate that hydrus 2d 3d was more sensitive to increases in water applications than fertilizer applications under the modeled conditions detailed nitrogen mass balance components for all soils and scenarios for both hydrus and swat can be found in the supporting information figs s1 and s2 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 model variability and sensitivity in both hydrus 2d 3d and swat models water and n budget components exhibit spatial soil and climatic and temporal climatic variability that illustrates their responses to model inputs soil properties like available water content and saturated hydraulic conductivity affected percolation results soil a showed the highest percolation and soil d the lowest in both models across scenarios fig 11 however while percolation is a key driver of n losses n losses did not follow an identical trend across soils in either model with hydrus 2d 3d consistently having greater n losses in soil b and swat in soil c though each model estimated the least n losses in soil d fig 13 such findings underscore the influence of n cycle components on this process and demonstrate the complex responses exhibited by both models to varying inputs and parameterizations differences in soil properties resulted in different n mineralization dynamics in each model with hydrus 2d 3d largely being affected by water flow dynamics and swat being affected by organic matter content from incorporated plant residue in addition to moisture and temperature dynamics therefore the resulting differences in n mineralization altered the amount of n available for leaching additionally it is expected that other soil dependent n transformations such as denitrification and volatilization will further contribute to differences in the amount of n available for leaching especially for soil d for which the assumption of zero denitrification holds weakly within soils variability existed for all model outputs discussed as evident in the boxplot distributions in figs 10 to 13 due to inter annual climatic particularly precipitation variability there was positive correlation between annual precipitation and n losses et or percolation while n uptake showed a negative correlation to precipitation pearson s correlation coefficients 0 81 0 53 0 84 0 66 for hydrus 2d 3d and 0 61 0 32 0 73 and 0 47 for swat other climatic information such as solar radiation also can impact model results specifically in swat because its crop growth model includes crops responses to these drivers for example years with the lowest solar radiation produced some of the lowest yields and consequently some of the lowest n uptake values and highest n losses in hydrus 2d 3d this phenomenon is captured by the potential et used to define the atmospheric boundary conditions which is lower in years with lower solar radiation and therefore producing lower n uptake capturing the varying effects of historical climatic information helps develop a more robust long term average estimate for percolation and n losses particularly where comprehensive information related to crop and soil water and n status is not available to fine tune models for long term and or large level assessments regarding model sensitivity in swat crop transpiration and yield were affected by a number of crop model parameters related to these processes emphasizing the need for crop model calibration to accurately reflect water growth and nutrient dynamics while nearly all tested crop model parameters were sensitive across the four soils the sensitivity to the maximum rooting depth varied highlighting an interaction between crop and soil in the model previously identified sensitive soil hydraulic and transport parameters in hydrus 2d 3d affected mainly percolation and n losses while et and n uptake showed low variability percolation and n losses results from the 150 hydrus 2d 3d realizations showed that the uncertainty introduced with the pedotransfer functions and estimation of the dispersivity parameters has a smaller magnitude than the differences between fluxes simulated with hydrus 2d 3d and swat the swat processing tomatoes crop model was calibrated to the entire ssjv study area not to the individual soils and climates examined in this study yet this approach yielded acceptable hru specific results while the sensitivity analysis demonstrated which parameters were most sensitive a manual calibration approach was used to ensure that each parameter was reasonable and reflective of reality based on current knowledge and understanding and to mitigate potential crop model bias under different management scenarios this model is suitable for testing any combination of plausible management scenarios throughout the study area crop performance was less sensitive to soil parameters likely due to sufficient irrigation and n inputs across all scenarios of the soil parameters tested only available water capacity of the top layer had a strong effect available water capacity particularly in the top layer affects water and nutrient availability for root uptake and for leaching beyond the root zone saturated hydraulic conductivity also affects the rate of water and nutrient movement in the soil but values for the top layer had little effect on transpiration and yield in the tested model and only exhibited a relatively strong effect on et in soil d this may be due in part to swat s handling of percolation and n leaching soil moisture must exceed a layer s water holding capacity before water and nutrients are transported to the layer beneath 4 2 organic n cycling due to fundamental differences between the two models organic n cycling was represented differently in hydrus 2d 3d and swat however in both cases this major component of the n cycle was calibrated and there was an effort to set up the models as similarly as possible in the case of hydrus 2d 3d mineralization rates were based on a central valley organic n budget developed by geisseler et al 2019 that estimates n contributions from above and below ground crop residues and rhizodeposition for a number of annual crops as well as an estimated average soil organic matter depletion thus providing comprehensive accounting of potential n sources except for organic amendments these annual rates were represented by a zero order kinetic model that responded to moisture content alone and thus n mineralization was independent of extreme temperatures crop productivity and residue dynamics in contrast swat n mineralization is driven by crop residues c n ratio and an equilibrium between stable and active organic n pools therefore crop dynamics and soil properties directly influence n mineralization rates predicted by swat both approaches provide reasonable representations of n mineralization though the rates differ in terms of magnitude and timing in the baseline scenario swat average n mineralization was less than predicted by hydrus 2d 3d for soils a b and c though both models were consistent with information in geisseler et al 2019 swat n mineralization changed in response to management with higher rates in the n scenario in which more biomass and crop n residue were generated and lower rates in the i scenario that leached a portion of fertilizer n before crop uptake thus management in the i scenario led to a leaner n system over the simulation period in contrast organic n inputs were relatively consistent across scenarios in hydrus 2d 3d given that soil moisture content did not vary greatly among the scenarios since excess water in the i and ni scenario moved relatively quickly through the soil profile in addition to differences in the amount of n mineralization the two modeling approaches differed in terms of where n mineralization occurred in the soil profile in the case of hydrus 2d 3d most of the annual n mineralization occurred in the wetted zone around the emitter in swat n mineralization occurred mostly in the upper portion of the soil where residues were incorporated by tillage except in the case of soil d where it occurred throughout the soil profile due to relatively high soil organic matter at depth such differences may have partially affected root access to a portion of mineralized n though the magnitude of this effect is unclear 4 3 management practices both models demonstrate the influences of management practices on n losses with more applied water and fertilizer n resulting in more n losses furthermore it is evident that adequate fertilizer application rates can still be associated with significant leaching in some cases for example due to additions from mineralization and or mobilization of residual mineral n limited uptake due to lower yield or a relatively wet precipitation hydrologic year ascott et al 2017 bechmann et al 1998 lord et al 2002 both models also clearly show that irrigation management is as important as managing n supply to minimize leaching in these systems even with the baseline n rate additional irrigation caused an increase in n losses beyond the root zone due to a decrease in n uptake which also reduced yields in some cases this illustrates the importance of efficient irrigation to maintain high n use efficiencies and productive systems the management practices implemented in this study were developed to reflect current recommendations and typical practices associated with sdi systems utilized by growers in the study area e g split n applications through fertigation however identical practices are implemented on the same date year after year across the entire simulation period meaning no adjustments were made based on unique climatic or edaphic conditions therefore results from these simulations illustrate general model responses to representative practices over a range of historical climatic conditions in reality common practices e g soil nitrate tests tissue sampling and refined irrigation scheduling based on effective precipitation and crop water demand may be implemented such practices have the potential to allow growers to fine tune field conditions and improve n and water use efficiency by avoiding excess n application and increasing n residence time in the root zone geisseler et al 2020 in fact the cyclical accumulation of n in the soil profile in both hydrus 2d 3d and swat illustrates how n can be retained in a soil system and potentially utilized by subsequent crops as such results from both models underscore the value of considering site specific conditions in nutrient management and irrigation planning as opposed to exclusive reliance on fixed schedule based approaches 4 4 model comparison overall there was good agreement between the two process based models that were not specifically calibrated for percolation or n losses and that were developed independently to function at very different spatial scales regarding water budget components et and percolation were comparable even though soil water movement was determined by fundamentally different means in each model the correspondence between daily soil moisture conditions is weaker due to the differing approaches in the two models as would be expected gandolfi et al 2006 nitrogen budget components were also comparable with differences being explained in part by how each model handled various components of the n cycle to date few measurements of n losses in processing tomatoes are available which impedes comparison to monitoring results results from one study that employed a bayesian approach to estimate agricultural n loads based on groundwater nitrate concentrations showed values ranging from 25 to 125 kg ha 1 year 1 95 confidence interval with the most probable rate around 50 kg ha 1 year 1 for vegetables and berries lumped together ransom et al 2018 this is consistent with hydrus 2d 3d and swat results from this study in the absence of available field based data model based approaches that constrain better known aspects of water and n budgets i e et and n uptake provide reasonable estimates and allow for a more detailed evaluation of the effects of management practices furthermore both models can be updated and refined as more information becomes available through continued research in the study area and in comparable regions 4 5 new hydrological insights for the southern san joaquin valley applications of swat and hydrus 2d 3d may vary in that each model is particularly well suited to address specific questions at varying spatial scales for example hydrus 2d 3d is well suited to assess spatially and temporally discrete scenarios to explore the effects of the timing of fertilizer injection into irrigation water baram et al 2016 gärdenäs et al 2005 phogat et al 2014 the model can also be applied in larger scale assessments as well turkeltaub et al 2018 though it may become cumbersome and computationally demanding to assess a variety of large scale scenarios as this study demonstrates due to its integrated crop and n cycle components swat is well suited for capturing a variety of effects and processes that may vary across the landscape under different scenarios this makes it an attractive option for such assessments bauwe et al 2019 furthermore the customizable crop model allows for a direct comparison to crop yield information which can be beneficial for economically based studies xue et al 2021 both models are well suited for evaluating field scale processes assessed in this study particularly for the generic scenarios that were analyzed the current simulations are simple and general enough so that they can be used to assess potential n losses from processing tomato field in the southern san joaquin valley california under different management scenarios and for a wide range of soils well drained a to poorly drained d the presented modeling frameworks can be used to estimate absolute leaching rates based on an ensemble of 25 years of climate history or to formulate relative comparisons between leaching rates resulting from distinct suites of management practices hydrus 2d 3d might be used when specific soil information is available or when specific time dependent flow and transport are of interest while swat will be more suitable for cases when large scale regions and long term processes are the focus or when crop production outcomes are of interest both models demonstrate that long term simulations and measurements are needed to inform potential n losses in the regional scale mainly due to the precipitation induced inter annual variability such models either at the watershed or field scale can be used in lieu of or in addition to expensive monitoring in addition the modeling framework presented here reinforces the need to manage irrigation and n applications simultaneously to prevent nitrate losses below the root zone it can then be concluded that promoting conservation practices that target coordinated optimization of irrigation and fertilizer management would have a large impact in preserving regional groundwater quality 5 conclusions hydrus 2d 3d and swat model simulations were developed for sub surface drip irrigated processing tomatoes in the southern san joaquin valley ssjv of california swat was developed and manually calibrated at the landscape level for the entire ssjv while hydrus 2d 3d models were set up to represent four representative soils based on information compiled in swat with both models simulating the same 25 year historical climatic record 1990 2014 results from the site specific hydrus 2d 3d simulations and from the large scale swat model were compared for four irrigation and fertigation management scenarios overall there was good agreement between the models with respect to et percolation below the root zone and n uptake however n losses though positively correlated had discrepancies which could be attributed to differences in how each model handles soil processes related to n transformations and water and solute fate and transport both models responded in the same manner to changes in management practices suggesting that while the absolute fluxes may be less certain due to the limited calibration and minimal measured data available at the time of this study both models are useful for assessing how differing irrigation and or fertigation management practices would affect long term n losses at the regional groundwater basin scale moreover the range of soils used in this study from well to poorly drained allow to expand these conclusions to other soils in this range in the studied region both models show that n losses amounts can vary significantly from year to year due to changes in weather mainly precipitation conditions and cyclical soil nitrate accumulation and leaching furthermore each model demonstrates that fertilizer and irrigation management strongly affect crop n uptake and n losses suggesting that n and water need to be managed together to protect groundwater quality while maintaining productivity this study concludes that at the annual time scale both swat and hydrus 2d 3d give comparable results further studies including modeling other major central valley crops as well as more field observations of percolation and n leaching are needed to calibrate and refine field and regional scale assessments of how agricultural land management practices affect groundwater

7873,study region the southern san joaquin valley ssjv california four representative soil types were evaluated study focus evaluation of regional scale hydrology and nitrogen n fate and transport requires a robust modeling framework that considers critical local scale environmental conditions and crop root zone physical processes two widely used yet conceptually and mechanistically different

productive agricultural counties in the san joaquin valley e g fresno kern and king counties over 40 of tested domestic wells exceed the drinking water maximum contaminant limit for nitrate n mcl 10 mg l nitrate n burton 2018 fram 2017 nolan et al 2015 lockhart et al 2013 ward et al 2018 to address the problem of nitrate leaching from agricultural lands the state of california has developed several regulatory plans and programs such as the irrigated lands regulatory program ilrp 2019 and the central valley wide salt and nitrate management plan cv salts snmp 2016 groundwater quality management plans for threatened areas require that coalitions demonstrate that protective practices are being implemented in addition the sustainable groundwater management act sgma was passed in 2014 groundwater basins are categorized according to their risk of overdraft and local groundwater sustainability agencies develop plans that protect future groundwater quantity and quality harter 2020 these processes require innovative monitoring and assessment of the effects of management practices on groundwater quality growers and their coalitions are looking to models like swat and hydrus to help them meet their regulation obligations n in excess of crop uptake has the potential to pollute the environment and contribute to climate change zhang et al 2021 to mitigate nitrate leaching it is critical to understand the difference between applied and removed n in agroecosystems it is an important indicator for sustainability of agricultural productivity and soil and environmental quality eagle et al 2020 lawrence et al 2021 orellana macías et al 2021 sainju 2019 2017 n in a cropping system may be lost to the environment through surface runoff soil erosion denitrification volatilization lateral flow and leaching past the root zone irrigation and n fertilizer application rates and timings are two major crop management practices that strongly influence fate and transport of n liao et al 2012 ma et al 2021 sharma and bali 2018 n fertilizer application and timing based on residual soil n and crop n requirement help mitigate excess input of n and ensure optimal plant uptake castro bustamante and hartz 2015 farneselli et al 2015 lazcano et al 2015 with its unique landscape and mediterranean climate california is the largest agricultural producer and exporter in usa generating upwards of 50 1 billion gross revenue in 2019 cdfa 2020 processing tomatoes are among the top 10 crops in terms of production and revenue representing 96 of us domestic production and 30 of global supply winans et al 2020 fresno and kings counties in the san joaquin valley combined produce 47 2 of the state s processing tomato tonnage and produce some of the highest yields averaging 118 000 kg ha cdfa 2020 mechanization as well as improved varieties and production practices have all contributed to the success of this crop geisseler and horwath 2013 hanson and may 2006a in the past two decades large scale adoption of subsurface drip irrigation sdi has further helped boost productivity based on the yield potential of the field and variety typical n application ranges from 207 to 314 kg n ha and crop water demand ranges from 610 to 737 mm hartz 2017 these ranges illustrate that no single fertilizer or irrigation regime fits every field s requirement given the spatial heterogeneity of climate edaphic conditions and yield potential however with the increasing regulatory pressure on growers to improve n use efficiency it is important to accurately estimate fertilizer n requirements to minimize the risk of nitrate leaching geisseler et al 2020 mahmud et al 2021 field measurements of different components of the n cycle present a variety of challenges including high levels of spatial and temporal variation of solute transport and n leaching beyond the root zone in agricultural fields cherry et al 2008 field level mass balance calculations marsh 2019 2016 root and vadose zone monitoring baram et al 2016 farneselli et al 2018 turkeltaub et al 2016 lysimeter experiments knappe et al 2002 wang et al 2012 and models with different levels of complexity are some of the available tools to assess the n budget in cropping systems kurtzman et al 2013 the field level mass balance approach evaluates n inputs and outputs in a defined time period and can include measurements of soil mineral n pre planting and post harvest n inputs to the system and n in plant biomass and harvested materials cherry et al 2008 often with this method all unaccounted n is considered leached though n may be lost along other less commonly measured pathways such as gaseous losses or immobilization in organic matter root zone monitoring methods include the use of suction lysimeters that measure small areas and hence require a large number of measurement points to monitor a single field green et al 2008 ramos and kücke 2001 weighing lysimeters are a direct and reliable method for quantifying nutrient leaching in agricultural ecosystems knappe et al 2002 wang et al 2012 however their construction and maintenance is difficult and costly models represent a fast and cost effective option for estimating the different n budget components in an agroecosystem nolan et al 2010 several studies defterdarović et al 2021 epelde et al 2015 franqueville et al 2018 gärdenäs et al 2005 nolan et al 2010 turkeltaub et al 2018 used models to simulate the n cycle of a cropping system and demonstrated the utility of models as decision support tools to mitigate impacts of surplus n in agroecosystems examples of such models are the soil water assessment tool swat and hydrus which are widely used to predict nitrate leaching through root zones swat is the result of roughly 45 years of research and development work led by usda agricultural research services ars and scientists from various institutions gassman et al 2007 it was developed by combining three prominent models from the 1980 s namely creams chemical runoff and erosion from agricultural systems gleams groundwater loading effects on agricultural management system and epic erosion productivity impact calculator swat is a spatially distributed watershed scale hydrological model with a plant growth sub model that simulates leaf area development biomass accumulation water and nutrient uptake and crop yield for different plant species and cover types as such swat captures the influence of crop growth on both hydrology and nutrient cycling nair et al 2011 to accurately represent agricultural watersheds hydrus 2d 3d is a fully two and three dimensional variably saturated water flow and solute and heat transport model the hydrus 2d 3d software package is the result of collaborative research and development work led by the usda ars salinity laboratory uc riverside pc progress and the international groundwater modeling center mccray 2007 šimůnek et al 2008 the graphical user interface streamlines the definition and creation of the required finite element mesh as well as initial and boundary condition input files the numerical solution of the richards equation for multi dimensional problems makes hydrus a widely used tool for plot and field scale simulation of irrigation as well as reactive n transport and leaching doltra and mun 2010 eltarabily et al 2019 hardie et al 2018 karandish and šimůnek 2017 phogat et al 2014 ramos et al 2012 often models based on the richards equation e g hydrus 2d 3d šimůnek et al 2016 swap van dam et al 2008 rzwqm2 ma et al 2012 are applied to simulate transport at the pedon or field scale while process based semi empirical models are more suited for landscape scale applications cherry et al 2008 however research questions related to groundwater flow and its solute content span the field and watershed scales and thus warrant examination with both types of models vogel 2019 while processes such as agricultural management practices are local their effects and related policies operate at the watershed scale in the irrigated agricultural landscape it may take years for a measurable response of nitrate contamination in groundwater and such observations are often difficult to relate to a source emanating from a specific time and place and therefore to a specific agricultural practice on the land surface the novelty of this study lies in the comparison of two conceptually different models swat and hydrus 2d 3d which have policy implications these models were used to simulate processing tomatoes one of the predominant crops in the ssjv and the california s central valley under four different management scenarios across four regionally representative soil types the objectives of this study were to 1 develop swat and hydrus 2d 3d models with identical climatic soil and agricultural management information and 2 assess the combined effects of irrigation and n management practices on n losses with the two models for a range of soil types in the san joaquin valley of california 2 methods 2 1 study area the southern san joaquin valley ssjv has mostly deep heterogeneous alluvial soils that range in texture from sand to clay and are mostly well drained fig 1 the mediterranean climate with hot dry summers with maximum average temperature between 32 and 37 average precipitation of 165 290 mm year and average reference evapotranspiration eto of 1471 mm year is favorable for growing processing tomatoes processing tomatoes in this area are transplanted from late january through early june depending on weather conditions and are mechanically harvested from late june through october after harvest remaining non harvested biomass is incorporated into the soil and the planting beds are built for the next year with most fields remaining fallow during the winter crop rotation with other annual crops is a common management practice however there is no standard for which crops rotate and how many years of tomato are planted before a rotation is cropped nor how tomato management practices may be adjusted in response to potential rotational effects for this initial model comparison the crop rotation were not modeled with neither model in this study 2 2 swat model inputs and setup a swat model was built for the entire ssjv domain fig 1 a 30 meter dem digital elevation model raster from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm farr et al 2007 was used to create stream networks and delineate the basin and sub watersheds the smallest spatial unit at which swat performs process based simulations is called the hydrological response unit hru the hru is composed of a unique combination of soil land use and slope within the sub watershed a detailed and accurate representation of soil physical and chemical properties is crucial for accurate simulations of plant soil water nutrient dynamics swat requires information on soil texture rock fragments bulk density organic carbon available water content and saturated hydraulic conductivity soil information was obtained from the national cooperative soil survey soil characterization database and usda nrcs ssurgo soil survey geographic soils layer saturated hydraulic conductivity values were calculated from pedotransfer functions described in saxton and rawls 2006 based on soil texture bulk density and soil organic carbon vertically swat discretizes the root zone into a user defined number of soil layers here selected to be 4 9 10 and 7 layers for soils a b c and d respectively according to ssurgo database discretization land use information came from 2014 california department of water resources dwr land cover dataset allowing for the identification of fields under processing tomato and other land uses dwr 2016 swat requires daily information on solar radiation relative humidity wind speed air temperature and precipitation to simulate physical processes related to plant growth evapotranspiration et nutrient uptake and cycling and the water cycle these climate variables were collected from weather stations operated under cimis california irrigation management information system program swat assigns each sub watershed climate information from the weather station that is nearest to its centroid the weather data was qa qc d to identify invalid data and missing values and was prepped for the range of years simulated i e 1985 2015 four processing tomato hrus were identified with a range of different soil mapping units one each in the a b c and d hydrologic soil groups with soil a wasco series being a well drained sandy loam soil b excelsior and c westhaven moderately well drained loams and sandy loams respectively and soil d tulare a poorly drained silty clay fig 1 table s1 supporting information these hru s served as the basis for this study and for the development of the hydrus 2d 3d models the soil conservation service scs curve number procedure was used with the daily curve number calculated as a function of soil moisture content neitsch et al 2011 fertilizer and irrigation management practices are discussed in section 2 4 and were constant throughout the simulation period swat model simulations were executed for years 1985 2015 with a warm up period of 5 years 1985 1989 all inputs to the model including weather soil and crop management information were identical for both swat and hydrus 2d 3d models for the 4 selected hrus 2 2 1 swat model root zone water and n processes swat simulates major components of water nitrogen and phosphorous cycles n and p and allows for customization and calibration of these various processes to tailor simulations to a given set of conditions and improve model accuracy the plant available water content awc is defined in eq 1 as a function of the water content at field capacity fc and the water content at the wilting point wp all in units of length l the wp is calculated as a function of the clay content m c the bulk density ρ b g cm3 and a conversion factor eq 2 1 awc fc wp 2 wp 0 4 m c ρ b 100 these parameters are calculated for each soil layer and water is assumed to be uniformly distributed in the horizontal dimensions of the hru at every time step one day in this case after all fluxes have been accounted for to adjust water content water content higher than the fc is available to percolate vertically or to flow laterally out of each layer the actual water depth percolating from layer to layer is calculated as a function of the available water for percolation and travel time for percolation tt perc which is unique for each soil layer and is calculated as shown in eq 3 3 tt perc sat fc k sat where sat is the saturated water content l and k sat is the saturated hydraulic conductivity l t root water uptake and evaporation are distributed with depth across layers before computing percolation in each time step given the inherent uncertainty associated with site specific conditions across the swat modeling domain a number of conservative measures were taken with respect to root zone n processes to avoid potential systematic underestimation of nitrate losses below the root zone as a result estimations of n losses from swat and hydrus 2d 3d can be considered conservative under the modeled conditions in this study and may in some cases reflect overestimations n losses presented in this study were calculated as leaching from swat and as fluxes across the lower boundary condition in hydrus 2d 3d we hypothesized that these fluxes probably include some n amounts from processes assumed to be negligible in this study and therefore call them n losses the n cycle is simulated in swat as mineral gaseous and organic pools neitsch et al 2011 fig 2 users can select from default organic and inorganic fertilizer types or customize their own that vary in terms of their elemental n nitrate n ammoniacal n and organic n contents for this study all n was applied as elemental n which is rapidly converted to nitrate n and prohibits ammonia volatilization which would otherwise occur if ammoniacal fertilizers were used ammonia volatilization was ignored in this study for swat and hydrus 2d 3d to remain conservative in regards to nitrate losses estimates and because rates are mostly negligible in this cropping system where fertilizer is applied dissolved in the irrigation water via sub surface drip irrigation krauter et al 2006 in swat denitrification is a function of substrate concentration i e organic carbon and nitrate moisture content and soil temperature and can be calibrated with two parameters sdnco and cdn the former defines the moisture content threshold for which the denitrification begins while the latter is a process rate adjustment factor for this study the model was parameterized such that denitrification was negligible consistent with the hydrus 2d 3d setup while denitrification occurs in actual fields a synthesis by verhoeven et al 2017 found that average annual n2o emissions from processing tomato in california was about 1 98 kg ha 1 which included studies with furrow irrigation that tend to promote anaerobic conditions that favor denitrification viers et al 2012 estimated a 10 denitrification and volatilization of total applied n but this factor was used for all types of irrigation in the study area in california including furrow and sprinkler irrigation therefore it is not likely that total denitrification exceeds more than a few percent of n applied in the sub surface drip irrigated systems simulated in this study meaning it is often a relatively minor n budget component though some differences may exist in reality across soil types for example heavier textured soils like soil d may exhibit higher denitrification rates than coarser textured soils as such the current modeling approach is conservative in regards to nitrate losses results particularly in soil d swat simulates three different pools of soil organic n 1 fresh plant residue n 2 active organic n and 3 stable organic n which are a function of residue inputs and soil information organic n pools can accumulate or deplete depending on residue inputs decomposition rates soil water content soil temperature tillage and other soil parameters the model parameter cmn controls the rate at which active organic n is converted to the stable organic n pool with the default value set to 0 0003 for this study this value was adjusted to 0 00045 to promote residue decomposition and avoid relatively large accumulations in soil organic n that were observed during preliminary simulations using the default value data from de clerk et al 2003 suggest that in aggregate row cropping systems in california and cropping systems in the ssjv did not lead to statistically significant increases in total n in soil samples they assessed spanning approximately 60 years furthermore data from the university of california davis century experiment field sites show that conventionally managed tomato corn and tomato wheat cropping systems did not lead to increases in total soil n on average between 1993 and 2012 wolf et al 2018 atmospheric deposition of n was assumed to be negligible for this study as the estimated n deposition would be in the 1 range from other inputs viers et al 2012 2 2 2 swat model sensitivity analysis and calibration swat simulates crop growth and maturation as a function of solar radiation heat unit accumulation and water and nutrient availability and uptake there are 36 crop model parameters in swat that control the magnitude and timing of various crop processes including canopy and root development biomass accumulation yield as well as transpiration and nutrient uptake swat contains a database of more than 130 crop models however the existing crop specific parameters describing crop growth and productivity have often been developed in production environments that are different from and often less productive than california this necessitated modification of these parameters to represent typical california field conditions management practices and yield levels a global sensitivity analysis was performed with the sequential uncertainty fitting version 2 sufi2 algorithm abbaspour et al 2018 2007 available in swat cup swat calibration and uncertainty programs to evaluate the sensitivity of evapotranspiration and yield to crop model parameters tables 1 and 2 respectively using the ssqr objective function i e the sum of squares of the difference of the measured and simulated values after ranking in both cases crop model and soil parameters were varied across each of the four hrus included in this study the parameter sensitivity is computed by multiple linear regression systems 4 g α i 1 m β i bi where g is the objective function b is the parameter α is the regression constant β corresponds to the technical coefficient attached to the variable b and m is equal to the number of parameters the crop model parameters included in the sensitivity analysis in addition to bn1 bn2 and bn3 i e the optimal fraction of n in biomass at emergence 50 maturity and maturity respectively and heat units required to reach maturity were the main focus of manual calibration of the crop model soil parameters included in the analysis were the available water capacity and saturated hydraulic conductivity of the top soil layer where depths depend on each soil type table s1 processing tomato yield data used for calibration were collected from county agricultural commissioner reports for counties in the study area from 2010 to 2020 national agricultural statistics service accessed in june 2021 monthly actual evapotranspiration data used in the objective function was taken from a satellite based et estimation dataset paul et al 2018 parameters were manually calibrated in an iterative process at the landscape scale considering available literature and local knowledge a landscape scale manual crop model calibration approach was required because of the spatial and temporal complexity of cropping systems in this region which is not adequately characterized for any one crop in any one region across a sufficient period of time to allow for a site specific i e field level calibration approach in lieu of such data achieving representative landscape level dynamics of crop processes ensures that the suite of physical root zone processes captured for any one field are reasonably realistic default and calibrated values of crop growth parameters for processing tomato are given in table 3 2 3 hydrus 2d 3d model parameter choice and model application are described in section 2 3 1 unsaturated water flow in an isotropic medium was simulated with the hydrus 2d 3d

fertilizer was diluted in the irrigation water as urea ammonium and nitrate 1 2 and 3 respectively urea and nitrate were simulated only in the dissolved form while ammonium was considered in the adsorbed form as well solute uptake via transpiration was considered for nitrate and ammonium mineralization was considered in the top 30 cm of soil as a zero order reaction 6 θ c 1 t x i θ d ij c 1 x

density and water contents at 33 and 1500 kpa obtained from the database developed for the swat simulations were used as inputs for the rosetta3 pedotransfer function zhang and schaap 2017 soil hydraulic parameters of the van genuchten mualem model van genuchten 1980 and their associated errors were estimated table 1 supporting information the uncertainty about the estimated parameters was also provided by the pedotransfer function and was included in the simulations by performing a monte carlo based uncertainty analysis due to computational constraints only the most influential parameters described by skaggs et al 2013 were included namely saturated hydraulic conductivity k s an empirical shape parameter n and the dispersivity λ in this two dimensional case λ has longitudinal and transverse components respectively λl and λt as defined in šimůnek et al 2011 one hundred and fifty parameter combinations were sampled using the latin hypercube technique simlab 2 2 software saltelli 2004 assuming a log normal distribution for k s and n as given in rosetta3 with a different mean and standard deviation for each soil layer table s1 supporting information and a uniform distribution for the λl and λt with values between 5 and 15 cm for λl with λt 0 1 λl all soil layers were assumed to have the same dispersivity values the simulations with a range of values for the parameters k s λl and λt comprise not only the uncertainty that the pedotransfer functions bring with them but also include some of the uncertainty that would arise if the parameters were to be measured at different scales pachepsky and hill 2017 hydrus 2d 3d model variability resulting from the hydraulic parameter sensitivity analysis was measured as the coefficient of variation eq 11

uptake were considered and defined in eq 12 as p a mg day 1 for each solute time and location the maximum ammonium and nitrate concentrations allowed in the water removed from the flow region by root water uptake are defined as croot mg cm 3 in eq 13 table 4 and was calculated using measured n uptake rate dynamics over the season as reported in the literature t k hartz 2017 hartz and bottoms 2009

time and location nup is the daily n uptake mg day 1 and t is daily actual transpiration cm3 day 1 n mineralization was considered as a zero order reaction in a 30 cm depth range near the top of the soil profile with ammonium as the daughter product the 30 cm range for n mineralization was effectively 45 cm below the top of the growing bed and 15 cm below the lowest part of the topsoil profile the furrow zero order coefficients of n mineralization were manually calibrated for each soil table 4 so that total annual n mineralization would be in the range described by geisseler et al 2019 for similar ssjv soils 76 123 kg ha 1 both mineralization rates and max n uptake definitions were used to manually calibrate the model against experimental values from the literature the premise is that if both annual n uptake and mineralization rates are within measured ranges then the n losses differences that would be observed between hydrus 2d 3d and swat simulations are due to differences between the models flow transport uptake or other processes rather than other factors related to model inputs or outputs 2 3 2 domain properties for each modeled hru a specific 2d mesh was defined according to the varying soil layers and their distinct soil textures fig 4 profile depth ranged between 152 and 160 cm according to the profile information in the soil database developed for the swat simulations profile width was set to 75 cm assuming plant spacing of 150 cm fig 5 following hanson et al 2008 for soils a b c and d sandy loam loam silty loam and silty clay respectively figs 1 4 4000 2341 1829 and 2182 nodes were defined resulting in 7762 4512 3485 and 4189 2d elements respectively averaging on the order of 1 4 cm2 in size the differences in water contents at a pressure head of 400 cm for the modeled profiles are explained by the varying soil textures showing that soils a and d are more homogeneous than b and c fig 4 a meshline was defined at a depth of 150 cm where the water and n fluxes out of the root zone were recorded for all soil profiles sub surface drip irrigation emitters were represented as a half circle with a 1 1 cm radius at a 30 cm depth for all soil profiles in a 2d mesh with a finer mesh discretization around the dripper fig 5 the root density distribution was defined using the vrugt model vrugt et al 2001 with a maximum root depth of 150 cm depth of maximum intensity of 50 cm a shape parameter pz at 2 cm a maximum rooting radius of 75 cm and the radius of maximum intensity at 0 cm located where the plant is and px at 1 cm fig 5 the feddes water uptake reduction model feddes et al 1978 was considered with h 1 h 2 h 3 max h 3 min h 4 values of 1 2 800 1500 and 8000 cm respectively as described in hanson et al 2006 and a critical stress index of 0 8 assumed to allow for compensated root water uptake no solute stress model was included in the simulation and overall no water uptake reduction due to low water content or salinity was expected since irrigation was scheduled to be sufficient in volume and performed with low salinity water 2 3 3 initial and boundary conditions the boundary condition at the dripper was defined as a variable flux allowing for intermittent irrigation the topsoil was defined as an atmospheric boundary condition the lower end of the profile as free drainage and the rest of the domain boundary was defined as no flow fig 5 the hcrita parameter defined as the absolute value of the minimum allowed pressure head at the soil surface was set at the default value of 10000 cm fertilizer was applied in the form of urea nitrate and ammonium in the respective proportions 50 25 and 25 representing a common practice in central valley conventional processing tomatoes production irrigation and fertilizer amounts are described in section 2 4 model setup included a 5 year warm up period followed by 25 years of actual simulation atmospheric boundary conditions including et0 and precipitation were identical to that used in swat etc defined as et0 kc where kc is a crop coefficient was partitioned by assuming all of it to be considered as root water uptake in hydrus 2d 3d during the cropping season sdi is considered to have minimal soil water evaporation while all et0 was considered as potential soil water evaporation in between cropping seasons potential evaporation in between crop seasons was then reduced by the model according to the available water at the upper boundary crop coefficients were defined as in snyder et al 2007 for tomatoes 0 3 for the first 25 of the season a linear increase until the 50 of the season reaching 1 1 1 1 until 80 of the season and then a linear decrease to 0 65 at the end of the season 2 4 irrigation and fertigation management practices both swat and hydrus 2d 3d were simulated under the same management scenarios to evaluate the effects of management practices on percolation and n losses across soil and climate types in all simulations model runs retained consistent annually based management practices over the 25 year timeframe and no adjustments were made based on climate year type soil nitrate content or other factors this approach is not intended to imply or reflect actual long term land management but to provide insight into how each modeling unit in each scenario performs across the range of climatic variability that occurred throughout the 25 year simulation period a suite of management practices i e planting and harvest dates n fertilization and irrigation rates and timing and tillage were determined to reflect a relatively efficient and productive processing tomato cropping system based on uc cooperative extension recommendations and common practices implemented in the study area nitrogen management practices including application rate and timing were developed from three main sources 1 grower reported n application rate information from 2016 for 0 7 million hectares in 12 central valley water quality coalitions 2 crop production budgets developed by uc agricultural economists uc farm advisors and cooperating growers turini et al 2018 these budgets comprehensively list all major management activities typical of the geographical area of interest and 3 extensive consultation with uc extension specialists and farm advisors and other industry experts fertilizer applications were modeled as a single pre plant application and as fertigation events during the growing season fig 6 similarly irrigation practices including irrigation timing and volume were developed to match common practices in the studied area in both models drip irrigation was simulated and irrigation timing reflected the pattern of seasonal eta and the method of irrigation the resulting baseline scenario consists of 230 kg ha 1yr 1 n applied over 7 applications and 605 mm ha 1yr 1 applied over 38 irrigation events fig 6 this was the scenario used in the calibration with both models three additional management scenarios were developed utilizing different combinations of n rate and irrigation depth fig 6 under the same scheduling as the baseline scenario the remaining scenarios depicted higher n application n 265 kg ha 1yr 1 higher irrigation i 716 mm year 1 or both ni it should be noted that while the n i and ni scenarios apply higher input rates than the baseline they are also representative of common practices implemented in the study area 2 5 statistical analysis lin s concordance correlation coefficient ρ c as defined in eq 14 lin 2000 1989 was used to assess the agreement of the two models this coefficient allows comparison of the correlation between the models to a 45⁰ line that passes through the origin ρ c will range from 1 1 where a value of 1 means a perfect agreement between the models 0 represents no agreement and 1 a perfect disagreement cut off values for ρ c can be defined as good 0 8 moderate 0 65 0 8 and poor 0 65 agreement mcbride 2005 14 ρ c 1 2 σ 12 σ 1 2 σ 2 2 μ 1 μ 2 2 where μ 1 and μ 2 are the means of each model 1 and 2 in this case hydrus 2d 3d and swat respectively σ 1 2 and σ 2 2 are the variances of 1 and 2 and σ 12 is the covariance ρ c was calculated for each soil and scenario during the entire simulation on an annual basis 25 data points and also for the four simulated soils for each scenario 100 data points 3 results 3 1 swat and hydrus 2d 3d comparison to experimental ranges in literature the average in season et from swat model was 562 mm whereas it was 551 mm from hydrus 2d 3d the scatter plot of seasonal et from hydrus 2d 3d and swat shows a high degree of agreement with a ρ c value of 0 71 fig 7a though fallow period and total annual et were less correlated fig 7b these values agree with field studies hanson and may 2006b and remote sensing based eta measurements paul et al 2018 showing seasonal eta range of 450 600 mm for processing tomatoes the off season evaporation averaged 114 and 158 mm for swat and hydrus respectively with consistently higher evaporation values for hydrus 2d 3d values across all soils and years fig 7 b crop yield simulated in swat ranged from roughly 76 218 to 170 369 kg ha 1 and averaged 130 019 kg ha 1 across all soils under the baseline scenario while the 10 year average 2011 2020 for fresno kings and kern counties was roughly 116 569 kg ha 1 nass accessed october 2021 as mentioned swat crop growth calibration was intended to reflect fields with robust above average productivity meaning the calibration was adequate in this regard hydrus 2d 3d does not simulate crop yields n mineralization was simulated in hydrus 2d 3d as a zero order process and rate coefficients were manually calibrated for each soil eq 7 table 4 this resulted in annual n mineralization rates ranging between 86 and 116 kg n ha 1 averaged across the four soils fig 8 due to this approach coarser textured soils required higher rate coefficients than finer textured soils to achieve similar annual values table 4 n mineralization had a higher inter annual variability in swat relative to hydrus 2d 3d fig 8 demonstrating that swat s physically based model of n mineralization captures environmental effects that are not reflected in by the zero order kinetics assumed in hydrus 2d 3d runs in swat the four soils averaged between 63 and 130 kg ha 1yr 1 with soils a b and c in the lower end range for processing tomatoes reported in geisseler 2019 soil d a silty clay is relatively high in soil organic matter with carbon contents ranging from 1 05 to 2 54 resulting in higher n mineralization in swat there was a positive correlation ρ c 0 41 in the mineralization estimates from the two models fig 8 the mechanism for simulating n uptake differs between the two models with hydrus 2d 3d calculating the process by multiplying the water uptake at a specific node by the mineral n concentration at that node swat calculates n uptake demand as a fraction of the accumulated biomass with biomass determined by a crop growth function yet annual n uptake values were similar between the models with hydrus 2d 3d and swat averaging 282 and 285 kg ha 1 across soils respectively with relatively strong positive correlations ρ c 0 72 across the four soils and overall table 7 fig 9 when comparing the simulations to expected experimental values hartz 2017 both models underestimated the n uptake in some years generally in the same years agreement between the models decreased for years where swat n uptake was higher than the experimental range presented in hartz 2017 this was due to to the croot value imposed in hydrus 2d 3d which limited the maximum n uptake other data such as geisseler et al 2020 report n uptake values to have a linear relationship with n application and uptake as high as 378 kg ha 1 in plots fertilized with 300 kg n ha 1 suggesting potential substantial luxury consumption by this crop 3 2 hydrus 2d 3d and swat sensitivity analysis hydrus 2d 3d sensitivity to selected hydraulic and transport parameters was studied for the 25 year average baseline model outputs coefficients of variation cvs were calculated for 150 simulations performed for each soil nitrogen losses and water percolation had the highest cvs for the finer textured soil d silty clay and were lower in the range of 0 07 0 14 in the coarser soils table 5 nitrogen uptake et and root water uptake t had very low sensitivity to the selected hydraulic and transport parameters this suggests that the variability found in the n losses and percolation is directly tied to soil processes and is not a result of changes in the water or n uptake swat et was sensitive to crop model parameters related to leaf area development and decline across all four soils bold in table 1 though not to maximum canopy height r chtmx the maximum rooting depth parameter r rdmx influenced et in soils b and c though not a and d of the soil parameters tested the available water content of the top layer affected et in all four soils while only soil d exhibited sensitivity to saturated hydraulic conductivity of the top layer soil depth had no effect across the range tested crop yield in swat was sensitive to crop model parameters related to crop maturation t t base r frgrw1 temperature stress r t opt light interception r blai radiation use efficiency bio e maximum rooting depth and harvest index table 2 modeled n concentration in the yield r cnyld only affected total crop yield over the simulation period in soil b this sensitivity is due the reliance of subsequent crops on n mineralized from the previous year s residues when cnyield is increased and more n removed from the system less n is available for plant uptake for the next crop which triggers n stress and yield reduction conversely when less n is removed in yield additional n is available for uptake which triggered marginal increases in yield regarding soil parameters yield was sensitive to available water content in the upper layer in soils a b and c though not d soil depth had no effect in the range tested 3 3 irrigation and fertigation scenarios 3 3 1 water balance et was comparable for both models across all soils with differences largely coming from the handling of evaporation from the soil in the fallow season figs 7 10 there was interannual et variability due to changes in precipitation and eto there was little difference in et under the n i and ni scenarios compared to the baseline suggesting that in neither model were crops stressed by lack of water or n for soils a b c and d hydrus 2d 3d simulated 49 59 35 and 5 mm more average eta than swat respectively lin s concordance correlation coefficients calculated for each soil and scenario during the entire simulation for et were nearly constant across all scenarios table 6 runoff was negligible in swat ranging between 1 and 4 of water inputs on average across soils and was zero for all soils and scenarios in hydrus 2d 3d despite the differences between the water flow models in hydrus 2d 3d and swat percolation beyond the root zone was in good agreement between the two models for each soil and scenario fig 11 table 6 the on average lower percolation rates in hydrus 2d 3d relative to swat fig 10 in the coarser soils a and b were due to the systematically higher et in hydrus 2d 3d fig 10 the n scenario caused no change in percolation relative to the baseline scenario while the i and ni scenarios resulted in the same increased percolation for all soils in both models in scenarios with additional irrigation hydrus 2d 3d produced higher percolation relative to its baseline in the coarser textured soils a 103 and b 148 and compared to swat 78 and 98 though swat absolute values were larger figs 11 13 both models responded similarly in soil c 105 and swat simulating relatively more percolation in heavier textured soil d 275 compared to hydrus 2d 3d 200 fig 13 as with et lin s concordance correlation coefficients for percolation were almost constant across scenarios table 6 detailed mass balance components for all soils and scenarios for both hydrus and swat can be found in the supporting information figs s1 and s2 respectively 3 3 2 nitrogen balance n uptake was moderately well correlated between hydrus 2d 3d and swat in most soils and scenarios besides soil d that showed a poor correlation also each showed differences across scenarios differences in soil d are attributed to the n root availability with depth due to mineralization in the entire profile and the positive feedback of higher fertilizer higher biomass and therefore and increase in the mineralization in the next season due to higher plant residues in swat in the n scenario both hydrus 2d 3d and swat simulated higher n uptake relative to the baseline due to more n in the rootzone ranging from 10 to 12 and 14 20 respectively with swat runs showing the greatest n uptake in soil d 405 kg ha 1 fig 12 furthermore the hydrus 2d 3d models averaged uptake of nearly all of the additional 35 kg ha 1 of fertilizer n with n uptake increases ranging from 30 to 36 kg ha 1 with swat the n scenario caused positive feedback between n uptake and n mineralization of crop residues in the i scenario both models took up less n relative to the baseline by roughly 10 15 due to increased percolation and reduced n residence time in the root zone n uptake was within 5 of the baseline under the ni scenario for both models with swat simulating minor increases and hydrus 2d 3d simulating minor decreases swat crop yields were impacted by n uptake with n showing a 3 6 increase i showing a 4 7 decrease and the ni showing a 0 2 increase n mineralization was relatively constant across scenarios in hydrus 2d 3d since soil water content remained relatively consistent compared to the baseline due to soil drainage however values varied in swat due to the effects of n uptake and subsequent crop residue decomposition under the n scenario n mineralization increased by 29 36 relative to the baseline while under the i scenario it decreased by 14 20 and under the ni scenario it decreased by 3 10 under the simulated conditions swat predicted storage of organic n in the stable organic n pool a sn in swat in each scenario for soils a b and c but only in the n scenario for soil d for other scenarios soil d exhibited a net depletion of soil organic n reserves via n mineralization furthermore through a mass balance calculation considering n uptake n removed in yield and residue n conversion to nitrate and active organic n f mn in swat it is shown that a fraction of crop residue n is not broken down on average across the simulation period across all soils and scenarios the sum of these two organic n storage pathways i e stable organic n and crop residue n ranged from 7 to 17 kg n ha 1 year 1 on average across scenarios similar to n mineralization organic n storage was highest in the n scenario for all soils due to increased n uptake biomass production and crop residue n while the i scenario resulted in the lowest accumulation due to reduced residue n inputs the baseline and ni scenario were comparable and averaged approximately 11 kg n ha 1year 1 of storage in both cases across soils for the baseline scenario swat and hydrus 2d 3d n losses results across all soils were 28 swat mean 19 swat median 53 hydrus mean and 33 hydrus median kg ha 1 year 1 with moderate agreement when compared on an annual basis the differences are partly explained by lower n mineralization estimates and n movement into soil organic n storage in swat lin s concordance coefficients were higher for the finer textured d soils for n losses in all the scenarios table 7 nitrate losses agreement between the models varied with soil and scenario and while the baseline and n scenarios had good moderate and poor agreement depending on soil type all soils had poor agreement under the i and ni scenarios table 7 both models responded to climatic differences within the simulation period specifically high precipitation years 1995 1998 data not shown produced higher percolation and n losses with both models n losses increased more with hydrus 2d 3d than with swat furthermore somewhat normal to drier conditions led to accumulations of leachable n in the soil profile in both models as is suggested by median annual losses values being lower than the mean trends in mineral n storage in soil water or on sorption sites were in the same range for both models and there was no clear pattern of one model storing more mineral n than the other data not shown regardless most accumulated n was eventually leached by percolation in both models illustrating that the 5 year warm up was sufficient to initiate the models and that the 25 year simulation period captured the longer term fate of n under the n scenario both models increased n losses though swat showed a greater increase relative to its baseline than did hydrus 2d 3d fig 14 this is because hydrus 2d 3d took up nearly all of the additional n leaving little extra to leach relative to the baseline fig 13 furthermore all of the plant n is removed from the system with harvest in hydrus 2d 3d whereas crop residues remain and decay in swat allowing for subsequent mineralization which can eventually contribute to n losses in the i scenario both models showed greater n losses relative to baselines though hydrus 2d 3d increased more 71 107 than swat 33 89 fig 14 this is partly due to the difference in how each model handles the soil physical processes and is compounded by differences in n mineralization while hydrus 2d 3d simulates relatively constant n mineralization year after year the lower n mineralization in swat due to less crop n uptake resulted in less leachable mineral n under the ni scenario both models showed the greatest n losses furthermore the increase in losses relative to the baseline was very similar with hydrus 2d 3d and swat increasing between 86 and 126 and 91 208 respectively fig 14 relative to the baseline n losses in the i scenario increased about 15 19 in hydrus 2d 3d for swat increases in losses were comparable in the n and i scenario though the combination ni triggered the largest response fig 14 these differences further illustrate that hydrus 2d 3d was more sensitive to increases in water applications than fertilizer applications under the modeled conditions detailed nitrogen mass balance components for all soils and scenarios for both hydrus and swat can be found in the supporting information figs s1 and s2 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 model variability and sensitivity in both hydrus 2d 3d and swat models water and n budget components exhibit spatial soil and climatic and temporal climatic variability that illustrates their responses to model inputs soil properties like available water content and saturated hydraulic conductivity affected percolation results soil a showed the highest percolation and soil d the lowest in both models across scenarios fig 11 however while percolation is a key driver of n losses n losses did not follow an identical trend across soils in either model with hydrus 2d 3d consistently having greater n losses in soil b and swat in soil c though each model estimated the least n losses in soil d fig 13 such findings underscore the influence of n cycle components on this process and demonstrate the complex responses exhibited by both models to varying inputs and parameterizations differences in soil properties resulted in different n mineralization dynamics in each model with hydrus 2d 3d largely being affected by water flow dynamics and swat being affected by organic matter content from incorporated plant residue in addition to moisture and temperature dynamics therefore the resulting differences in n mineralization altered the amount of n available for leaching additionally it is expected that other soil dependent n transformations such as denitrification and volatilization will further contribute to differences in the amount of n available for leaching especially for soil d for which the assumption of zero denitrification holds weakly within soils variability existed for all model outputs discussed as evident in the boxplot distributions in figs 10 to 13 due to inter annual climatic particularly precipitation variability there was positive correlation between annual precipitation and n losses et or percolation while n uptake showed a negative correlation to precipitation pearson s correlation coefficients 0 81 0 53 0 84 0 66 for hydrus 2d 3d and 0 61 0 32 0 73 and 0 47 for swat other climatic information such as solar radiation also can impact model results specifically in swat because its crop growth model includes crops responses to these drivers for example years with the lowest solar radiation produced some of the lowest yields and consequently some of the lowest n uptake values and highest n losses in hydrus 2d 3d this phenomenon is captured by the potential et used to define the atmospheric boundary conditions which is lower in years with lower solar radiation and therefore producing lower n uptake capturing the varying effects of historical climatic information helps develop a more robust long term average estimate for percolation and n losses particularly where comprehensive information related to crop and soil water and n status is not available to fine tune models for long term and or large level assessments regarding model sensitivity in swat crop transpiration and yield were affected by a number of crop model parameters related to these processes emphasizing the need for crop model calibration to accurately reflect water growth and nutrient dynamics while nearly all tested crop model parameters were sensitive across the four soils the sensitivity to the maximum rooting depth varied highlighting an interaction between crop and soil in the model previously identified sensitive soil hydraulic and transport parameters in hydrus 2d 3d affected mainly percolation and n losses while et and n uptake showed low variability percolation and n losses results from the 150 hydrus 2d 3d realizations showed that the uncertainty introduced with the pedotransfer functions and estimation of the dispersivity parameters has a smaller magnitude than the differences between fluxes simulated with hydrus 2d 3d and swat the swat processing tomatoes crop model was calibrated to the entire ssjv study area not to the individual soils and climates examined in this study yet this approach yielded acceptable hru specific results while the sensitivity analysis demonstrated which parameters were most sensitive a manual calibration approach was used to ensure that each parameter was reasonable and reflective of reality based on current knowledge and understanding and to mitigate potential crop model bias under different management scenarios this model is suitable for testing any combination of plausible management scenarios throughout the study area crop performance was less sensitive to soil parameters likely due to sufficient irrigation and n inputs across all scenarios of the soil parameters tested only available water capacity of the top layer had a strong effect available water capacity particularly in the top layer affects water and nutrient availability for root uptake and for leaching beyond the root zone saturated hydraulic conductivity also affects the rate of water and nutrient movement in the soil but values for the top layer had little effect on transpiration and yield in the tested model and only exhibited a relatively strong effect on et in soil d this may be due in part to swat s handling of percolation and n leaching soil moisture must exceed a layer s water holding capacity before water and nutrients are transported to the layer beneath 4 2 organic n cycling due to fundamental differences between the two models organic n cycling was represented differently in hydrus 2d 3d and swat however in both cases this major component of the n cycle was calibrated and there was an effort to set up the models as similarly as possible in the case of hydrus 2d 3d mineralization rates were based on a central valley organic n budget developed by geisseler et al 2019 that estimates n contributions from above and below ground crop residues and rhizodeposition for a number of annual crops as well as an estimated average soil organic matter depletion thus providing comprehensive accounting of potential n sources except for organic amendments these annual rates were represented by a zero order kinetic model that responded to moisture content alone and thus n mineralization was independent of extreme temperatures crop productivity and residue dynamics in contrast swat n mineralization is driven by crop residues c n ratio and an equilibrium between stable and active organic n pools therefore crop dynamics and soil properties directly influence n mineralization rates predicted by swat both approaches provide reasonable representations of n mineralization though the rates differ in terms of magnitude and timing in the baseline scenario swat average n mineralization was less than predicted by hydrus 2d 3d for soils a b and c though both models were consistent with information in geisseler et al 2019 swat n mineralization changed in response to management with higher rates in the n scenario in which more biomass and crop n residue were generated and lower rates in the i scenario that leached a portion of fertilizer n before crop uptake thus management in the i scenario led to a leaner n system over the simulation period in contrast organic n inputs were relatively consistent across scenarios in hydrus 2d 3d given that soil moisture content did not vary greatly among the scenarios since excess water in the i and ni scenario moved relatively quickly through the soil profile in addition to differences in the amount of n mineralization the two modeling approaches differed in terms of where n mineralization occurred in the soil profile in the case of hydrus 2d 3d most of the annual n mineralization occurred in the wetted zone around the emitter in swat n mineralization occurred mostly in the upper portion of the soil where residues were incorporated by tillage except in the case of soil d where it occurred throughout the soil profile due to relatively high soil organic matter at depth such differences may have partially affected root access to a portion of mineralized n though the magnitude of this effect is unclear 4 3 management practices both models demonstrate the influences of management practices on n losses with more applied water and fertilizer n resulting in more n losses furthermore it is evident that adequate fertilizer application rates can still be associated with significant leaching in some cases for example due to additions from mineralization and or mobilization of residual mineral n limited uptake due to lower yield or a relatively wet precipitation hydrologic year ascott et al 2017 bechmann et al 1998 lord et al 2002 both models also clearly show that irrigation management is as important as managing n supply to minimize leaching in these systems even with the baseline n rate additional irrigation caused an increase in n losses beyond the root zone due to a decrease in n uptake which also reduced yields in some cases this illustrates the importance of efficient irrigation to maintain high n use efficiencies and productive systems the management practices implemented in this study were developed to reflect current recommendations and typical practices associated with sdi systems utilized by growers in the study area e g split n applications through fertigation however identical practices are implemented on the same date year after year across the entire simulation period meaning no adjustments were made based on unique climatic or edaphic conditions therefore results from these simulations illustrate general model responses to representative practices over a range of historical climatic conditions in reality common practices e g soil nitrate tests tissue sampling and refined irrigation scheduling based on effective precipitation and crop water demand may be implemented such practices have the potential to allow growers to fine tune field conditions and improve n and water use efficiency by avoiding excess n application and increasing n residence time in the root zone geisseler et al 2020 in fact the cyclical accumulation of n in the soil profile in both hydrus 2d 3d and swat illustrates how n can be retained in a soil system and potentially utilized by subsequent crops as such results from both models underscore the value of considering site specific conditions in nutrient management and irrigation planning as opposed to exclusive reliance on fixed schedule based approaches 4 4 model comparison overall there was good agreement between the two process based models that were not specifically calibrated for percolation or n losses and that were developed independently to function at very different spatial scales regarding water budget components et and percolation were comparable even though soil water movement was determined by fundamentally different means in each model the correspondence between daily soil moisture conditions is weaker due to the differing approaches in the two models as would be expected gandolfi et al 2006 nitrogen budget components were also comparable with differences being explained in part by how each model handled various components of the n cycle to date few measurements of n losses in processing tomatoes are available which impedes comparison to monitoring results results from one study that employed a bayesian approach to estimate agricultural n loads based on groundwater nitrate concentrations showed values ranging from 25 to 125 kg ha 1 year 1 95 confidence interval with the most probable rate around 50 kg ha 1 year 1 for vegetables and berries lumped together ransom et al 2018 this is consistent with hydrus 2d 3d and swat results from this study in the absence of available field based data model based approaches that constrain better known aspects of water and n budgets i e et and n uptake provide reasonable estimates and allow for a more detailed evaluation of the effects of management practices furthermore both models can be updated and refined as more information becomes available through continued research in the study area and in comparable regions 4 5 new hydrological insights for the southern san joaquin valley applications of swat and hydrus 2d 3d may vary in that each model is particularly well suited to address specific questions at varying spatial scales for example hydrus 2d 3d is well suited to assess spatially and temporally discrete scenarios to explore the effects of the timing of fertilizer injection into irrigation water baram et al 2016 gärdenäs et al 2005 phogat et al 2014 the model can also be applied in larger scale assessments as well turkeltaub et al 2018 though it may become cumbersome and computationally demanding to assess a variety of large scale scenarios as this study demonstrates due to its integrated crop and n cycle components swat is well suited for capturing a variety of effects and processes that may vary across the landscape under different scenarios this makes it an attractive option for such assessments bauwe et al 2019 furthermore the customizable crop model allows for a direct comparison to crop yield information which can be beneficial for economically based studies xue et al 2021 both models are well suited for evaluating field scale processes assessed in this study particularly for the generic scenarios that were analyzed the current simulations are simple and general enough so that they can be used to assess potential n losses from processing tomato field in the southern san joaquin valley california under different management scenarios and for a wide range of soils well drained a to poorly drained d the presented modeling frameworks can be used to estimate absolute leaching rates based on an ensemble of 25 years of climate history or to formulate relative comparisons between leaching rates resulting from distinct suites of management practices hydrus 2d 3d might be used when specific soil information is available or when specific time dependent flow and transport are of interest while swat will be more suitable for cases when large scale regions and long term processes are the focus or when crop production outcomes are of interest both models demonstrate that long term simulations and measurements are needed to inform potential n losses in the regional scale mainly due to the precipitation induced inter annual variability such models either at the watershed or field scale can be used in lieu of or in addition to expensive monitoring in addition the modeling framework presented here reinforces the need to manage irrigation and n applications simultaneously to prevent nitrate losses below the root zone it can then be concluded that promoting conservation practices that target coordinated optimization of irrigation and fertilizer management would have a large impact in preserving regional groundwater quality 5 conclusions hydrus 2d 3d and swat model simulations were developed for sub surface drip irrigated processing tomatoes in the southern san joaquin valley ssjv of california swat was developed and manually calibrated at the landscape level for the entire ssjv while hydrus 2d 3d models were set up to represent four representative soils based on information compiled in swat with both models simulating the same 25 year historical climatic record 1990 2014 results from the site specific hydrus 2d 3d simulations and from the large scale swat model were compared for four irrigation and fertigation management scenarios overall there was good agreement between the models with respect to et percolation below the root zone and n uptake however n losses though positively correlated had discrepancies which could be attributed to differences in how each model handles soil processes related to n transformations and water and solute fate and transport both models responded in the same manner to changes in management practices suggesting that while the absolute fluxes may be less certain due to the limited calibration and minimal measured data available at the time of this study both models are useful for assessing how differing irrigation and or fertigation management practices would affect long term n losses at the regional groundwater basin scale moreover the range of soils used in this study from well to poorly drained allow to expand these conclusions to other soils in this range in the studied region both models show that n losses amounts can vary significantly from year to year due to changes in weather mainly precipitation conditions and cyclical soil nitrate accumulation and leaching furthermore each model demonstrates that fertilizer and irrigation management strongly affect crop n uptake and n losses suggesting that n and water need to be managed together to protect groundwater quality while maintaining productivity this study concludes that at the annual time scale both swat and hydrus 2d 3d give comparable results further studies including modeling other major central valley crops as well as more field observations of percolation and n leaching are needed to calibrate and refine field and regional scale assessments of how agricultural land management practices affect groundwater

7874,study region sawla tuna kalba 4226 km2 study focus this study employed qgis to assess the groundwater potential in the sawla tuna kalba district of ghana with some selected surficial factors while estimating the groundwater recharge from 1981 to 2021 new hydrological insights among the classification algorithms tested random forest rf yielded the highest overall accuracy with 93 63 while support vector machine svm and gaussian mixture model gmm had 90 22 and 84 73 respectively from the ahp model geology had the highest weight of 0 279 it was found that low potential regions comprise 229 53 km2 moderate zones comprise 1700 62 km2 high potential zones comprise 2135 04 km2 and excellent potential areas were found to be 152 14 km2 the groundwater recharge due to rainfall computed

35 mm but between 1981 and 2021 the total recharge was 1191 18 0 35 mm also from the soil analysis it was found that 56 21 of the study area would allow infiltration in conclusion it was observed that the groundwater potential in the study area was high and can be attributed to the recharge and present surficial conditions graphical abstract ga1 keywords groundwater potential geology remote sensing quantum gis recharge data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction groundwater is described as one of the most valuable resources on the earth found within the subsurface namely sediments cracks fractures crevices faults and many more saeedi et al 2010 these subsurface features can also be referred to as hydrogeological environments or provinces groundwater occurs below the water table and usually fills all void spaces hydrogeological environment in the saturated zone of the rocks kresic and bonacci 2010 the international groundwater resources assessment centre igrac described groundwater as a hidden resource that occurs naturally and is recharged by rainwater snowmelt or water that leaks from rivers and lakes into the ground globally groundwater use has grown to be extensive and intensive over the past decades population growth and industrialization have made groundwater one of the optimum sources of water supply especially in the rural world abdul ganiyu and prosper 2021 according to a study conducted by the united nations educational scientific and cultural organization s international hydrological program unesco ihp approximated that about 50 of the world s population relies on groundwater however policymakers know very little about this resource leaving it underutilized the united nations international children s emergency fund and the world health organization unicef who estimated that more than 1 1 billion people around the world do not have access to water marsalek et al 2014 mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 also reported that about 4 billion people in the world lack access to water for at least one month of the year the study further posited that at the current consumption rate the precarious situation would get worse if proper exploitation of this resource is not done it was concluded that by 2025 two thirds of the world population may face a drastic water shortage this could increase progressively to about 4 8 5 7 billion by 2050 and about 73 of the affected victims may be from asia burek et al 2016 these shortages will be exacerbated by climate change and bio energy demand in the ecosystem global water institute gwi also projected that about 700 million of the world population may be displaced by severe water scarcity gwi 2013 despite positive economic growth there remains an immense need for water in ghana and sub sahara africa ssa the rise of the covid 19 pandemic on the other hand is an added disadvantage to improving people s access to safe water because global attention is focused on combating the pandemic rather than the water supply crises in ghana about three million people depend on surface water to meet their daily water needs exposing them to water related diseases water org a study by wateraid ghana estimated that about 6 million people lack access to clean water which is approximately 1 in 5 of the population the essence of these statistics is to show the water crises in the world and the need to assess the groundwater potential in ghana and the world at large over the past decade several techniques either scientific or non scientific have been used to delineate groundwater zones across the world tafila et al 2022 and most of these techniques are however still in existence interestingly these methods have been considered to be laborious and time consuming and require large data sets to be able to predict a groundwater point chai et al 2020 ese et al 2017 however the use of geographic information system gis and remote sensing rs tools will increase groundwater exploration successes thus the involvement of remote sensing in the search for groundwater can lessen the burden on prospecting díaz alcaide and martínez santos 2019 while on the other hand giving an empirical understanding one pressing advantage of using remote sensing is its ability to be used on a large scale and also to access inaccessible areas that may be limited by known and unknown factors tolche 2020 following the arid nature of the study region and studies on water scarcity adam and appiah adjei 2019 andualem and demeke 2019 martin and van de giesen 2005 naghibi et al 2017 this study focuses on the spatial distribution of groundwater potential in the study area using quantum gis and multi criteria decision analysis qgis ahp the groundwater potential map was developed visualizing areas of low and high distribution while hydro geophysical survey and recharge estimation were incorporated to give more insights about its availability this process was done methodically to conform with past and present studies rahmati et al 2015 díaz alcaide and martínez santos 2019 abdalla et al 2020 tolche 2020 amidst the effects of climatic change variability on surface water resources the global south continues to struggle for water for consumption and agriculture while its groundwater resource is considered very high compared to other continents siebert et al 2010 sorensen et al 2021 the question is why is groundwater not fully exploited in this part of the world and the study area this gap can be attributed to little knowledge of groundwater resources and their potential limited or fragmented data no ongoing groundwater monitoring to assess various aquifers limited capacity to plan poor quality of groundwater in some parts of the study area high operating costs and a lack of personal experience the essence of this study would also form the basis for the attainment of the sustainable development goals sdgs 1 no poverty 2 zero hunger 3 good health and wellbeing 8 decent work and economic growth 10 reduced inequality and 13 climate action since groundwater can be harnessed for various domestic and industrial activities this will also contribute enormously to the ghana government s development agenda of the planting for food and jobs by providing baseline information on groundwater availability in the context of groundwater irrigation 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area sawla tuna kalba district fig 1a is one of the twenty 20 administrative districts of the savannah region of ghana it shares boundaries with the upper west region to the north ivory coast to the west north and west gonja to the east and bole bamboi to the south the study area has a total land area of about 4226 km2 the study area is located at latitude 9 171 n and longitude 2 251 w the district is generally undulating in terms of relief and its altitude ranges between 164 86 and 377 73 m fig 1a above sea level with the southern part being slightly flat and sloping gently towards the north the main drainage system in the district is made up of the black volta and its tributaries the effect of the drainage system is observed mostly in the northern part of the district covering the areas between gindabor to jermakuraa these areas are prone to periodic flooding during the wet season thus making them suitable for rice cultivation yeleliere et al 2018 one of the tributaries of the white volta kongpe stretches to constitute a natural boundary between the north gonja and central gonja districts loh et al 2020 the area receives an annual rainfall of averaging 911 mm adam and appiah adjei 2019 considered enough for a single farming season but fig 1b shows that the total rainfall for 2021 was 912 65 mm which a high daily rainfall of 59 65 mm 19th october 2021 temperatures are usually high averaging 34 c loh et al 2020 the maximum temperature was observed to be 33 3 c and the minimum was 23 45 c for 2021 fig 1b the relationship between rainfall and temperature is weak r2 0 2148 indicating uncertain rainfall patterns fig 1b the low temperatures are experienced from december to late february during which the north east trade winds harmattan greatly influence the district in general high temperatures and low humidity caused by the dry harmattan winds favor high rates of evaporation and transpiration resulting in water shortages for both domestic and agricultural purposes loh et al 2020 the district is located in the interior guinea savanna woodland which could sustain large scale livestock farming as well as the cultivation of staples like rice groundnuts yams cassava maize cowpea and sorghum the trees found in the area are drought resistant and hardly shed their leaves completely during the long dry season most of these trees are of economic value and serve as an important means of livelihood especially for women notable among these are shea trees vitellaria paradoxa the nuts which are used for making shea butter and dawadawa parkia biglobosa which provides seeds used for condimental purposes 2 1 1 geological and hydrogeological settings the savannah region falls within the birimain and voltaian basin which covers more than a third of the total land area of ghana the birimain formation is of granitoids and volcaniclastics as seen in fig 2 while the dominant minerals are k feldspar and biotite table 1 the voltain formations consist of quartzite schist shale sandstone and conglomerate or pebbly beds baffoe et al 2018 the extensive sediment dominant area was about 265 92 km2 wacke which may have been formed from sedimentation and compaction although there are areas of uniform lithology interbedding of different lithological mineral compositions and the details are described in table 1 and fig 2 the study area encompasses about 1 8 of ghana s total land area fig 2 the lithological cover within this study area is unique and distinct compared to other areas because of the interbedding of different lithology these units are evident in the towns of damongo sawla larabanga and kulmasa along the major road linking the savannah region to the upper west region these units ancestry is of volcanic activities and hence consist of some meta volcanic units bruce et al 2009 these surface water systems are tributaries of the white and black volta borehole depths vary widely from 21 0 m to 99 0 m and yields range from 0 3 m3 h to 12 0 m3 h anornu et al 2009 bruce et al 2009 this can be attested to the partial weather depth of about 18 80 m fig 2 anku et al 2009 uncovered a positive correlation between borehole depth and yield while aquifer transmissivity in ghana among sandstones ranges from 0 1 to 52 0 m2 d siltstone and mudstone aquifers have transmissivity ranging from 0 2 to 16 0 m2 d anornu et al 2009 zango et al 2014 in general the voltaian aquifers in ghana have a strong relationship between aquifer transmissivity and specific capacity abdul ganiyu and prosper 2021 anornu et al 2009 the study area generally has groundwater suitable for domestic and agricultural use but some parameters like tds and ph make the quality poor loh et al 2020 this includes a low ph ranging from 3 5 to 6 0 and a high concentration of iron throughout the study area zango et al 2014 the majority of groundwater quality issues can be attributed to hydro geochemical processes in bedrock rock aquifers and anthropogenic activities resulting in high sodium chloride concentrations with thin overburden of about 5 m fig 2 2 2 choosing the groundwater influencing factors groundwater occurrence is associated with a wide range of factors which include geomorphology geology lineament density drainage density soil land use land cover curvature topographic wetness index rainfall slope and roughness abdalla et al 2020 díaz alcaide and martínez santos 2019 omolaiye et al 2020 however this study selected factors like geology lineament density rainfall slope drainage density soil and land use land cover lulc as the main controlling determinants of groundwater occurrence in the study area the main focus of the study is to use quantum gis with analytical hierarchy process ahp in the assessment of groundwater potential in the savannah region of ghana the essence of using qgis over other gis environments is because qgis is an open source program and hence has better performing algorithms used in groundwater assessment that are free and accessible 2 3 data collection and processing a review of literature has shown that researchers across the globe have adopted the use of different models in assessing groundwater potential and they include frequency ratio elvis et al 2022 guru et al 2017 oh et al 2011 weights of evidence chen et al 2018 rane and jayaraj 2022 artificial intelligence alqadhi et al 2021 chen et al 2020 hakim et al 2022 machine learning arabameri et al 2021 kalantar et al 2019 lee et al 2020 logistic regression fadhillah et al 2021 nguyen et al 2020 random forest and maximum entropy kalantar et al 2019 rahmati et al 2016 and support vector machine farzin et al 2021 naghibi et al 2017 however the use of ahp has been in several studies hussain et al 2015 othman et al 2020 and specifically in groundwater assessment arulbalaji et al 2019 ifediegwu 2022 rahmati et al 2015 sapkota et al 2021 this study employed ahp because of its resilience in handling complex decisions in groundwater assessment firstly the soil and geological data were acquired from the regional office agricultural departments but these data were in a shapefile format these data were converted from shapefile to raster formats using the feature conversion tools moreover a total of 157 gps points were picked and 34 points were augured in the sawla tuna kalba to validate the soil map in the study area the lineament complexes were extracted from the dem srtm dataset 30 m using the pci geomatica program the complexes were built using the hill shade tool with the azuthimal combinations of 315 45 200 50 160 60 and 50 90 this was to extract the different levels of fractures because smaller fractures may not be visible in the 315 45 combinations the fractures were drawn by creating a new shapefile line and the density was produced using the line density tool in arcgis the lineament density was assigned a weight of 0 2397 due to the influence of infiltration and deep percolation the lineament density is simply the total length of lineaments per unit area eq 1a in kilometer square km km2 magesh et al 2012 1a lineament density le a where le is the total length of lineaments in the study area and a is the area data used to develop the drainage density map was acquired through the usgs website www eathexplorer usgs gov dem srtm image of 30 m resolution the drainage density was produced using the tools flow direction stream accumulation stream feature and stream order the density eq 1b is given as the total length of rivers and streams per the unit area rane and jayaraj 2022 1b drainage density ls a where ls is the total length of rivers and streams in the study area and a is the area the slope was produced using the same dem srtm 30 m data with the help of the slope tool the drainage density was assigned a weight of 0 057 because of the low impact of drainage on the groundwater potential the lulc in this study is considered a very important factor because studies have reported the impacts of land use change on groundwater quantity and quality pandey et al 2020 tadese et al 2020 this study collected 411 ground truthing points of different lulc features on the field see figs 3a g with a gps garmin gpsmap 62sc out of the 411 points 55 polygons were created with each polygon containing an average of 10 points as used in the classification process one of the focuses of this study was to evaluate the accuracies of lulc classification algorithms since lulc is the main component of groundwater assessment the general assumption is that low accuracy in lulc maps affects the final accuracy of the groundwater potential map and vice versa however in using a high performing classification algorithm like support vector machine svm and random forest rf specific lulc classes can be mapped with high precision and accuracy these lulc classes are often inseparable from one another like grassland riparian vegetation open and close savannah woodland therefore it is imperative to subject the lulc to different algorithms in qgis to assess the overall accuracies the sentinel 2a satellite image of 17 02 2022 was downloaded from www eathexplorer usgs gov for the lulc classification the essence of this satellite imagery was because of its 10 m resolution band 2 3 4 and 8 compared to landsat 8 modis lidar and many more the description of the different lulc classes table 2 was captured using a drone dji it was observed that the major farming system practice in the study area is agroforestry where trees are either grown or left within the farms to provide shed and fruits this system of farming is very crucial because it compensates for trees lost due to deforestation and bush burning 2 4 analytic hierarchical process ahp ahp is one of the commonly used multi criteria decision analysis techniques in the field of agricultural environmental hydrological and groundwater studies rahmati et al 2015 analytic hierarchical process ahp which was originally proposed by saaty 1977 was used in this study to assign weights to each determinant spatial layers in this process a pairwise comparison matrix is generated by comparing the assigned scores for each layer the scores are generally assigned between 1 equal importance to 9 extreme importance saaty 1987 in the ahp model a pairwise comparison matrix for the 7 layers was created taking into account the importance of each layer to groundwater occurrence see supplementary data table 7 the normalized weights of the individual layers were created using the eigenvector method the weight of each determining factor is derived from the maximum eigenvalue in the normalized eigenvector in the pairwise comparison matrix as seen in table 3 the reliability of the judgment is dependent on the consistency ratio cr and its value must be less than or equal to 0 1 in case it exceeds this limit it is suggested to revise the process again until consistency of 0 1 is achieved and the consistency was within a 0 1 limit in this study the cr was computed using eq 2 2 cr ci ri where ri is the random index and ci is the consistency index and was computed using eq 3 3 ci λ max n n 1 in this equation λ is the principal eigenvalue of the matrix and n is the number of factors used in the estimation saaty 1987 groundwater potential zones were derived from 7 spatial layers integrated into the qgis and arcgis environment to compute the groundwater potential index gwpi this is done by the weighted linear combination wlc as suggested by malczewski 1999 seen in eq 4 4 gwpi w 1 m j 1 n w j x i here gwpi is the groundwater potential index xi is the normalized weight of the ith feature of the thematic layer wj is the normalized weight of the jth thematic layer m represents the total number of themes and n is the total number of classes in a theme however this phenomenon in arcgis uses the overlay tool while eq 4 is practical in qgis using the raster calculator geology had the highest weight of 0 279 followed by lineament density with 0 2397 justified by the nature of the birimian supergroup and intrusive rocks present in the study area fig 2 where fracturing plays a significant role in groundwater recharge 2 5 overlay analysis after the weights of the selected layers were determined each layer lulc soil slope geology lineament density drainage density and rainfall was reclassified into four 4 classes of natural breaks the essence of reclassifying the layers was to ensure that they carry the weights in the overlay analysis if the layers are not reclassified the computed weights would not be applied the reclassified layers were uploaded into the qgis 3 16 environment and the raster calculator was used to multiply the weightage assigned by each corresponding layer to produce the groundwater potential map seen eq 4 this technique is quite different from the usual overlay analysis in arcgis which requires loading the layers using the overlay tool in the arc tool box and assigning the weights 2 6 hydro geophysical assessment of groundwater potential cross validation a geophysical survey is considered laborious time consuming and expensive in the absence of reliable background information and sometimes fragmented data findings from this work would provide enough information on the groundwater potential in the study region using qgis remote sensing while lifting the load on geophysical survey in groundwater exploration this study deployed geophysical techniques to investigate groundwater occurrence in the study area to complement results from the groundwater potential map the choice of any geophysical method depends on the purpose and geological setting present cheng et al 2019 lin et al 2018 the different hydro geophysical techniques include electrical resistivity electromagnetic induction gravity seismic and traditional methods abidin et al 2011 rolia and sutjiningsih 2018 taha et al 2021 this study adopted the use the electrical resistivity in five communities gbenyiri changbalayiri kaawie korle and monah because it is the most common and effective method used in africa mesbah et al 2017 mohamaden et al 2016 2 7 electrical resistivity method vertical electrical sounding vertical electrical sounding ves is a technique used for investigating geological mediums based on the electric current produced sarpong asare and menyeh 2013 there are several configuration arrays used when considering electrical resistivity methods for groundwater exploration namely wenner schlumberger dipole dipole and dipole pole aizebeokhai 2010 the dipole dipole method was employed because of its ability to probe deeper and studies have shown its accomplishments with regard to borehole drilling in northern ghana sarpong asare and menyeh 2013 the abem terameter module sas 4000 was used to measure the resistivity of the geological formation while probing for the occurrence of this resource the dipole dipole array configuration shown in fig 4 was used in detecting the groundwater resistivity while the apparent resistivity was computed using the geometric factor k the average profile length was about 170 m to allow for deeper probing and readings were picked at 5 10 m intervals profile interval the data were analyzed using microsoft excel 2016 it was used to plot resistivity against profile interval regions of low resistivity played a huge role in choosing points for drilling purposes for groundwater decision making and cross validate results from the groundwater potential map 5

groundwater recharge to assess the potential of groundwater resources across the globe it is important to investigate the natural recharge and hence this study sought to estimate the recharge that contributes to the groundwater reserve natural recharge occurs as precipitation or surface water infiltrates into the soil through the pores down to the water table this study acquired daily precipitation data from the ghana meteorological service within the study area from 1981 to 2021 studies have adopted developed models like swat khoi et al 2022 and mudflow jang et al 2016 hassan and khalaf 2020 but little has been done using direct estimation to ascertain the exact recharge using this method oke et al 2013 this study adopted the chaturvedi formula eq 6 to compute the groundwater recharge due to rainfall while the volume was computed using eq 7 6 r 2 0 p 14 0 4 for p 400 mm 7 ra 2 0 p 14 0 4 area where r net recharge due to precipitation in mm ra net recharge due to precipitation in cubic meters and p annual precipitation in mm chaturvedi 1973 derived an empirical relationship based on water level fluctuation and rainfall amounts to estimate groundwater recharge as a function of annual precipitation in mm the formula was applicable in areas that receive annual precipitation of more than 400 mm this study applied this relationship to the rainfall data obtained between 1981 and 2021 to compute the groundwater recharge due to rainfall also the standard error se was estimated to give a close certainty of the estimated recharge with eq 8 8 se σ n where se is the standard error σ is the standard deviation and n is the number of years 3 results and discussion 3 1 determining factors of groundwater potential in this study the factors considered to influence groundwater occurrence include lulc soil slope rainfall lineament density drainage density and geology these factors were thoroughly investigated to determine the spatial availability of groundwater in the area and similar factors have been used according to literature david ndegwa kuria 2012 ifediegwu 2022 kalantar et al 2019 3 1 1 land use land cover lulc map the lulc classification yielded eight classes in the study area fig 5 this study tested the accuracies of three classification algorithms svm rf and gmm but rf had the highest overall accuracy 93 63 and kappa coefficient 0 94 compared to the other algorithms table 4 several studies have reported that svm has high accuracy however this study found rf to have high accuracy which is consistent with studies rahman et al 2020 roy 2021 the eight 8 lulc types were bare land 6 54 km2 water bodies 3 31 km2 riparian vegetation 40 23 km2 grassland 773 33 km2 close savannah woodland 2555 02 km2 cropland 335 43 km2 open savannah woodland 238 83 km2 and settlement 271 16 km2 the relationship between groundwater and vegetation rv gl cswl and oswl cannot be underestimated because deep rooted tree species dominant in the study area like mahogany swietenia mahagoni baobab adansonia digitata dawadawa parkia biglobosa ebony diospyros ebenum and shea vitellaria paradoxa taps into the groundwater reserve and also serve as cover mulch to reduce groundwater losses through evaporation umar et al 2009 the lulc was assigned a weight of 10 28 because the major effect on groundwater is rapid urbanization because the population rise in the savannah region from 2010 to 2021 was about 71 905 people however the settlement was found to be 271 16 km2 these statistics indicate the pressure that would be mounted on water resources especially groundwater and the need to conduct this research prabhakar and tiwari 2015 in a study around madhya pradesh found that areas with high settlements have low groundwater potential due to industrialization and urbanization whereas areas with thick vegetation would have high groundwater potential due to high infiltration and percolation thick vegetation in this area was 2555 02 km2 findings from this study are similar to studies by prabhakar and tiwari 2015 due to the same lulc types hence vegetation is an important component in determining groundwater occurrence elmahdy et al 2020 liaqat et al 2021a 3 1 2 lineament density the geological lineament was found to range from 0 157 to 0 785 km km2 fig 6 geological lineaments are indicators of deeper earth structures fractures faults joints fractures with obvious displacements ruptures with no fractured displacements that are not visible to the naked eye hussein et al 2018 and the weight of 23 97 was assigned the link between groundwater availability and lineament density cannot be undermined since these features determine the amount of groundwater within an area david ndegwa kuria 2012 high groundwater occurrence in a region can be associated with high fracture density within the basement rock however high density was found in some areas with high yielding boreholes areas with lineament density ranging from 0 314 to 0 7847 km km2 indicate high fractures which are potential groundwater zones the study area is underlain by crystalline hard rock fig 2 and groundwater can only exist if there are interconnected fractures adam and appiah adjei 2019 in this study geological lineament had the second highest weight because groundwater in the study area is primarily defined by fractures which are consistent with results from the field works it was evident that some drill wells showed artesian properties as a result of high fracturing and atmospheric pressure yusof et al 2011 3 1 3 rainfall fig 7 shows the annual rainfall distribution in the study area and it was found to range from 798 02 mm year to 1471 9 mm year rainfall plays an important role in determining groundwater potential zones because it is the primary source of natural recharge which leads to aquifer productivity rainfall is the natural source of recharge but this would depend on effective percolation rainfall that contributes to groundwater recharge which also depends on several factors like lulc soil and slope hence in the pair wise ranking it was assigned a weight of 11 81 however studies show that the study area has experienced extremely heavy rainfall loh et al 2020 areas with high rainfall and vegetative cover result in high infiltration and deep percolation resulting in the natural replenishment of groundwater whereas areas with low rainfall and no vegetation would result in low infiltration and hardpans which retarding groundwater recharge liaqat et al 2021b murthy and mamo 2009 prabhakar and tiwari 2015 fig 7 shows that the northern part receives more rainfall compared to the other areas 3 1 4 lithology the geological map fig 8 shows that the birimain supergroup accounts for approximately 3355 km2 of the area voltaian units account for 3 km2 and the mesozoic was found to have an area of 77 km2 eburnean was 380 km2 and the tamnean units account for about 412 km2 the geology in the study area was assigned the highest weight of about 27 because of its importance to groundwater occurrence the study area consists primarily of metamorphic and sedimentary rocks which are reported to have high groundwater yield chernet 1993 in terms of lateral inflows lithological units are the host of pathways for groundwater the regolith and fractures on the other hand are the primary groundwater holding and transmitting zones meanwhile areas with good fractured systems may have low groundwater potential in completely weathered formations as a result the geological in the study area are crucial determinants in unearthing regions of high potential for exploration purposes the birimian covers about 74 of the country s landmass and is of particular interest to the water economies of the rural population in ghana yidana et al 2012 although the birimian serve as prolific aquifers for most domestic groundwater exploration they are highly variable they are generally discontinuous and localized due to the complexity of the geology hence would determine the availability of groundwater potential these rock types have low intrinsic primary porosity and permeability except in areas with some weathering or fracturing due to secondary activities these areas showed high electrical resistivity values during the hydro geophysical assessment justifying the weight assigned these weathered or fractured zones govern the aquifers hydrogeological environment producing substantial yield where there are interconnected fractured zones 3 1 5 soil the dominant soil types in the study area are depicted in fig 9 while the areas of each soil type are shown in table 5 it was found that the soil classes consist of two or more types of soil this is because during the field survey it was found that each soil class contains proportions of different soil types as seen in fig 9 soil is a critical factor in controlling the rate of infiltration and runoff which is important for groundwater replenishment also soil types influence crop suitability water holding capacity and soil nutrients in the context of irrigation weathered soils sandy loam would have high porosity and permeability which are good for infiltration whereas clay soils would have low infiltration soil types like vertisol fluvisols and gleysol would have a low affinity for infiltration and hence would lead rainfall to runoff while soil types like plinthosol lixisols and luvisols will lead to high infiltration generally it was found that 56 21 of the land area would allow infiltration which is a pathway for groundwater recharge therefore a weight of 8 25 was assigned for that reason soil type is regarded as a major factor in determining zones of good groundwater potential pandey et al 2020 3 1 6 drainage density fig 10 shows that the drainage density ranges from 0 0748 to 0 763 km km2 indicating that the area of interest aoi is reasonably drained and thus a good region of groundwater occurrence the stream channel is commonly used to assess the productivity of a watershed this thematic layer is of moderate importance compared to the other 6 layers because high drainage density would depend more on soil geology lulc and rainfall and hence was assigned the lowest weight 5 70 this property is important in investigating groundwater potential zones because a good drainage system influences percolation and leads to groundwater replenishment regions of this activity are potential areas of groundwater occurrence and for this reason some boreholes along the white volta the boundary between the study area and cote d ivoire were highly productive areas with drainage densities ranging from 0 203 to 0 7631 km km2 have a good drainage system depicting good potential zones a similar study by tolche 2020 in the dhungeta ramis sub basin ethiopia reported drainage density values ranging from 0 3410 to 0 5669 km km2 the values in this current study are higher compared to that of tolche 2020 3 1 7 slope the slope in the study area was expressed in meters as shown in fig 11 the slope ranges from 164 9 m to 377 7 m recent studies have shown that regions characterized by high elevation hilltops are likely to have a low groundwater occurrence while regions with low elevation may have high groundwater occurrence abebrese et al 2022 bhowmick and ojha 2019 ganapuram et al 2009 magesh et al 2012 nguyen et al 2020 a borehole on top of a hill is considered to have a low yield while valley areas may be good groundwater zones generally groundwater resources with high yields are found within valley areas wei et al 2019 this is because gentle slopes have the affinity of holding runoff for a long period to facilitate groundwater recharge this study found that high slopes in the study area are undulating and have the propensity of accommodating groundwater within the valleys the slope gradient is an important factor in determining the movement of groundwater abdalla et al 2020 adeyeye et al 2019 alipour et al 2018 the topography is also evident in the contours and shows that areas of closed contours are consistent with areas of high slopes and consistent with excellent groundwater zones see fig 9 from fig 11 it can be noticed the closed contour lines within the mid section of the study area are primarily dominated by the tamnean plutonic units fig 8 which are associated with high groundwater potential because of its primary and secondary porosities also these are comparable to regions dominated by lixisols fig 9 that would allow high infiltration slope influences rainfall infiltration directly and is regarded as the main factor in determining groundwater potential al saud 2018 this can also be used to show the point of groundwater recharge or flow in a specific basin gupta and srivastava 2010 and this phenomenon is useful in groundwater harvesting 3 2 groundwater potential zones the different zones of possible occurrences and quantities of groundwater in the study area are presented in fig 12 the groundwater potential was classified into low moderate high and excellent classes these classes were classified based on ariel coverage viz low potential regions comprise 229 53 km2 moderate zones comprise 1700 62 km2 high potential zones comprise 2135 04 km2 the largest in terms of land stretch and excellent potential areas were found to be 152 14 km2 this study is consistent with abdalla et al 2020 abebrese et al 2022 adeyeye et al 2019 arulbalaji et al 2019 azma et al 2021 david ndegwa kuria 2012 doke et al 2021 ifediegwu 2022 kumar et al 2018 magesh et al 2012 oh et al 2011 rahmati et al 2015 these case studies reported groundwater potential ranges from low to high with high potential being the least in terms of ariel coverage fig 12 shows that the sawla tuna kalba area has a high groundwater potential which can be exploited to supplement domestic and agricultural especially irrigational activities a majority of this resource falls within the moderate to high groundwater zones this zone is predominantly made up of intrusive rocks of the birimian eburnean and tamnean plutonic suites fig 8 which are of particular importance to the water economies of ghana obuobie and barry 2010 the granite intrusive rocks are not inherently permeable but rely on secondary porosities through fracturing and weathering for groundwater recharge from the results higher lineaments densities are characterized in fig 12 as regions of moderate excellent groundwater potential and this can be attributed to the fracture densities within the tamnean formation fig 8 from fig 12 borehole points 93 were overlayed on the groundwater potential map and 11 of them disagreed with the model while 82 agreed based on high yielding boreholes found at low potential areas and low yielding boreholes were also observed at regions of high potential also the validation results showed that areas with moderate high potential areas are suitable for deep seated wells such as boreholes because of the formation it was further observed that areas with low potential are dominated by shallow and hand dug wells which yield enough during the rainy season but dry up during the dry season this phenomenon can be noticed in fig 9 where low potential areas in fig 12 correlated with areas dominant with stagnosols and planosols which are possible zones of perched aquifers these findings imply that this kind of aquifer would occur in the rainy seasons since groundwater can only be stored in the intermediate soil layers and the subsurface 3 3 cross validation of the gis model ninety three 93 borehole yield data obtained from the water resources commission of ghana were used in cross validating the output of the groundwater potential map generated the contours were based on the assumption that the higher the contour density the higher the groundwater potential from the analysis fig 13 it was observed that the borehole yield obtained related to the groundwater potential map generated a majority of the high yielding boreholes fell within the high to excellent groundwater potential areas suggesting confirmation of the results high to excellent potential areas may be suitable for deep seated wells whereas shallow and hand dug wells may be suitable during the rainy season for low potential areas results from the test wells confirm that the groundwater potential in the study area is significantly high and borehole discharges ranging from 17 to 530 m3 day satisfy the essence of the cross validation the transmissivity results are used to explain an aquifer medium s ability to transmit water through it and thus the results obtained suggest that the three geologic media can transmit a large amount of groundwater up to 210 m2 day which is consistent with previous studies abdul ganiyu and prosper 2021 it is therefore appropriate to say that results from the pumping test and the overlay analysis confirm the possibility of groundwater exploration is not far fetch with the required management and sustainability practices 3 4 hydro geophysical survey results the geographical settings of all the 13 points picked in this study are presented in table 6 but the locations of the five 5 studied communities are seen in fig 12 from the survey it was found that the studied communities showed high groundwater occurrence which shows that the groundwater potential map from this study can be used to reduce the burden on geophysical survey in the study region findings from the analysis showed that low resistivity points between 0 2 and 203 ωm were the preferred areas of groundwater occurrence and also research has indicated that low resistivity regions ranging from 0 1 to 1024 4 ωm are good groundwater points bayewu et al 2018 duc vu et al 2021 resistivity is inversely proportional to porosity rolia and sutjiningsih 2018 and hence low resistivity is equal to high porosity and high groundwater potential also resistivity is inversely proportional to hydraulic conductivity seidu et al 2019 and therefore low resistivity would indicate high groundwater occurrence from figs 14a to c it was noticed that resistivity ranges from 0 038 to 264 ωm high resistivity in groundwater geophysics ranging from 200 to 1000 ωm values is attributed to dry soils at near surface or fresh bedrock suryadi et al 2020 while very low values of less than 0 2 ωm suggest the presence of clay deposit benoit et al 2019 moreover the high resistivity values 264 ωm in fig 14a found in this study can be linked to the high tension power line by the road while fig 14b 109 ωm and 14c 100 7 ωm may be connected to the compact soils from fig 14a the groundwater points were picked and labeled ves ga 30 and ga 90 with the resistivity of 177 ωm while ves ga110 was 40 ωm table 6 these analysis are consistent with abd el gawad et al 2018 mohamaden et al 2016 riwayat et al 2018 sunkari et al 2021 but omolaiye et al 2020 in a study in nigeria that found groundwater resistivity range from 103 to 180 ωm which can be as a result the similarities lithology the observation from fig 14a is comparable to figs 14b 14c and 14e except fig 14d this is because at korle two 2 profiles were taken as seen in fig 14d in the first profile very high resistivity values were measured at a distance of 120 m hence another profile was taken and similarities from the first profile were evident in the second the groundwater resistivity values from the first and second profiles were 423 ωm ves ka 30 and 744 ωm ves kb 130 respectively the details pertaining to resistivity in each community are seen in supplementary data tables 1 5 the values recorded were very high compared to other resistivity values from the other communities and this can be evident from the fractured and massive exposed rocks within the community in the second profile field experience played an important role because the negative resistivity points were presumed dry clay zones and hence resistivity values of 744 ωm suggest that the present rock is either fractured or permeable suryadi et al 2020 while high resistivity values in surface rocks is a function of high fractured density sunkari et al 2021 two 2 out of the thirteen 13 points taken were drilled and this was done in two communities gbenyiri ves ga 110 and korle ves ka 30 after the loggings it was observed that the average drill depth was 75 m and the yield was 125 l min the first layer which was about 5 m thick was mainly laterite shallow plinthosols while between 10 and 25 m were made up of weathered granitoid which are consistent with the lithology in fig 2 and fig 8 however between the lateritic layer and the partially weathered granite there was some wetness observed which correlates to soil type fig 9 which consists of the deep fluvisols and vertisols the results pertaining to borehole success and performance are seen in supplementary data figs 1and 2 3 5 groundwater recharge in the hydrologic cycle rainfall and groundwater recharge are considered among the important components because of their direct relationship khoi et al 2022 fig 15a shows the annual groundwater recharge between 1981 and 2021 in the study area it was observed that the highest recharges were in 1981 and 2012 within an amount of 33 22 0 35 mm and 32 59 0 35 mm respectively while the least was observed in 2002 with an amount of 23 45 0 35 mm in 1981 and 2012 the annual rainfall was found to be 1139 06 and 1085 33 mm respectively while in 2002 the annual rainfall was found to be 485 16 mm as seen in fig 15b and the other years are presented in the supplementary data table 6 and 7 this analysis indicates that the groundwater recharge within the study area is largely influenced by the annual rainfall and hence the higher the annual rainfall the higher the recharge and vice versa this relationship is seen in fig 15a which shows a strong correlation between rainfall and recharge r2 0 997 meaning rainfall is dependent on recharge also the standard error was estimated to be 0 35 mm suggesting that annual recharge varies plus or minus 0 35 mm more importantly it was found that about 2 85 of the total annual rainfall is converted to groundwater recharge this rate is comparable to studies by dekongmen et al 2022 that modeled the groundwater recharge rate to be 1 65 using qswat in the afram plains of ghana the difference in the rate may be associated with the high temporal variation in the savannah region and the surface geology the total groundwater recharge due to rainfall in 2021 was 30 18 0 35 mm 12 7 mm3 but the total recharge between 1981 and 2021 41 years was found to be 1191 18 0 35 mm 5031 4 mm3 fig 15b also shows the relationship between annual rainfall and annual groundwater recharge it was found that in periods of high annual rainfall high groundwater recharge is obtained also this analysis primarily shows that high rainfall areas are associated with high groundwater recharge therefore from fig 7 it was observed that the northern part of the study area received a high amount of rainfall and can be further observed that the northern part of groundwater potential map shows high potential as seen in fig 12 in summary it can be concluded that the validity of the groundwater recharge rainfall and groundwater potential in this study area is at an acceptable level 4 conclusion the use of remote sensing and some grounding methods to examine groundwater potential has grown in popularity in recent years and it can help to reduce the burden on geophysical study results presented in this study indicate high groundwater occurrence which can be extracted to an appreciable level with the right management practices the regions of groundwater occurrence were found to varied from low zone areas which comprise 229 53 km2 moderate zones comprise 1700 62 km2 and high potential zones comprise 2135 04 km2 the largest in terms of land stretch and the area with excellent potential was 152 14 km2 also from the hydro geophysical survey it was observed that low resistivity regions are zones of possible groundwater occurrence except for korle which showed high resistivity as a result of the surface geology pumping test results from boreholes were found to have a high yield ranging from 20 to 350 m3 day which suggests that the occurrence of groundwater in the area is irrefutable also values on transmissivity indicate that the aquifer medium has a high tendency to transmit water through it and hence the focus of this study can be considered analyzed the groundwater recharge due to rainfall computed indicates that an average of 2 85 of the total annual rainfall goes to groundwater recharge with a variation of 0 35 mm the highest recharge was observed in 1981 33 22 0 35 mm and the lowest in 2002 23 45 0 35 mm while the total recharge between 1981 and 2021 was 1191 18 0 35 mm a little above average 56 21 of the study area would allow infiltration into groundwater which is largely attributed to the characteristics of the soil type this result shows that the groundwater recharge due to rainfall in the study area is high and also attests to the fact that groundwater potential in the study area is high funding not applicable credit authorship contribution statement

7874,study region sawla tuna kalba 4226 km2 study focus this study employed qgis to assess the groundwater potential in the sawla tuna kalba district of ghana with some selected surficial factors while estimating the groundwater recharge from 1981 to 2021 new hydrological insights among the classification algorithms tested random forest rf yielded the highest overall accuracy with 93 63 while support vector machine svm and gaussian mixture model gmm had 90 22 and 84 73 respectively from the ahp model geology had the highest weight of 0 279 it was found that low potential regions comprise 229 53 km2 moderate zones comprise 1700 62 km2 high potential zones comprise 2135 04 km2 and excellent potential areas were found to be 152 14 km2 the groundwater recharge due to rainfall computed from the chaturvedi formula indicates that an average of 2 85 of the total annual rainfall goes to groundwater recharge with a variation of 0 35 mm the total recharge for 2021 was found to be 30 18 0 35 mm but between 1981 and 2021 the total recharge was 1191 18 0 35 mm also from the soil analysis it was found that 56 21 of the study area would allow infiltration in conclusion it was observed that the groundwater potential in the study area was high and can be attributed to the recharge and present surficial conditions graphical abstract ga1 keywords groundwater potential geology remote sensing quantum gis recharge data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction groundwater is described as one of the most valuable resources on the earth found within the subsurface namely sediments cracks fractures crevices faults and many more saeedi et al 2010 these subsurface features can also be referred to as hydrogeological environments or provinces groundwater occurs below the water table and usually fills all void spaces hydrogeological environment in the saturated zone of the rocks kresic and bonacci 2010 the international groundwater resources assessment centre igrac described groundwater as a hidden resource that occurs naturally and is recharged by rainwater snowmelt or water that leaks from rivers and lakes into the ground globally groundwater use has grown to be extensive and intensive over the past decades population growth and industrialization have made groundwater one of the optimum sources of water supply especially in the rural world abdul ganiyu and prosper 2021 according to a study conducted by the united nations educational scientific and cultural organization s international hydrological program unesco ihp approximated that about 50 of the world s population relies on groundwater however policymakers know very little about this resource leaving it underutilized the united nations international children s emergency fund and the world health organization unicef who estimated that more than 1 1 billion people around the world do not have access to water marsalek et al 2014 mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 also reported that about 4 billion people in the world lack access to water for at least one month of the year the study further posited that at the current consumption rate the precarious situation would get worse if proper exploitation of this resource is not done it was concluded that by 2025 two thirds of the world population may face a drastic water shortage this could increase progressively to about 4 8 5 7 billion by 2050 and about 73 of the affected victims may be from asia burek et al 2016 these shortages will be exacerbated by climate change and bio energy demand in the ecosystem global water institute gwi also projected that about 700 million of the world population may be displaced by severe water scarcity gwi 2013 despite positive economic growth there remains an immense need for water in ghana and sub sahara africa ssa the rise of the covid 19 pandemic on the other hand is an added disadvantage to improving people s access to safe water because global attention is focused on combating the pandemic rather than the water supply crises in ghana about three million people depend on surface water to meet their daily water needs exposing them to water related diseases water org a study by wateraid ghana estimated that about 6 million people lack access to clean water which is approximately 1 in 5 of the population the essence of these statistics is to show the water crises in the world and the need to assess the groundwater potential in ghana and the world at large over the past decade several techniques either scientific or non scientific have been used to delineate groundwater zones across the world tafila et al 2022 and most of these techniques are however still in existence interestingly these methods have been considered to be laborious and time consuming and require large data sets to be able to predict a groundwater point chai et al 2020 ese et al 2017 however the use of geographic information system gis and remote sensing rs tools will increase groundwater exploration successes thus the involvement of remote sensing in the search for groundwater can lessen the burden on prospecting díaz alcaide and martínez santos 2019 while on the other hand giving an empirical understanding one pressing advantage of using remote sensing is its ability to be used on a large scale and also to access inaccessible areas that may be limited by known and unknown factors tolche 2020 following the arid nature of the study region and studies on water scarcity adam and appiah adjei 2019 andualem and demeke 2019 martin and van de giesen 2005 naghibi et al 2017 this study focuses on the spatial distribution of groundwater potential in the study area using quantum gis and multi criteria decision analysis qgis ahp the groundwater potential map was developed visualizing areas of low and high distribution while hydro geophysical survey and recharge estimation were incorporated to give more insights about its availability this process was done methodically to conform with past and present studies rahmati et al 2015 díaz alcaide and martínez santos 2019 abdalla et al 2020 tolche 2020 amidst the effects of climatic change variability on surface water resources the global south continues to struggle for water for consumption and agriculture while its groundwater resource is considered very high compared to other continents siebert et al 2010 sorensen et al 2021 the question is why is groundwater not fully exploited in this part of the world and the study area this gap can be attributed to little knowledge of groundwater resources and their potential limited or fragmented data no ongoing groundwater monitoring to assess various aquifers limited capacity to plan poor quality of groundwater in some parts of the study area high operating costs and a lack of personal experience the essence of this study would also form the basis for the attainment of the sustainable development goals sdgs 1 no poverty 2 zero hunger 3 good health and wellbeing 8 decent work and economic growth 10 reduced inequality and 13 climate action since groundwater can be harnessed for various domestic and industrial activities this will also contribute enormously to the ghana government s development agenda of the planting for food and jobs by providing baseline information on groundwater availability in the context of groundwater irrigation 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area sawla tuna kalba district fig 1a is one of the twenty 20 administrative districts of the savannah region of ghana it shares boundaries with the upper west region to the north ivory coast to the west north and west gonja to the east and bole bamboi to the south the study area has a total land area of about 4226 km2 the study area is located at latitude 9 171 n and longitude 2 251 w the district is generally undulating in terms of relief and its altitude ranges between 164 86 and 377 73 m fig 1a above sea level with the southern part being slightly flat and sloping gently towards the north the main drainage system in the district is made up of the black volta and its tributaries the effect of the drainage system is observed mostly in the northern part of the district covering the areas between gindabor to jermakuraa these areas are prone to periodic flooding during the wet season thus making them suitable for rice cultivation yeleliere et al 2018 one of the tributaries of the white volta kongpe stretches to constitute a natural boundary between the north gonja and central gonja districts loh et al 2020 the area receives an annual rainfall of averaging 911 mm adam and appiah adjei 2019 considered enough for a single farming season but fig 1b shows that the total rainfall for 2021 was 912 65 mm which a high daily rainfall of 59 65 mm 19th october 2021 temperatures are usually high averaging 34 c loh et al 2020 the maximum temperature was observed to be 33 3 c and the minimum was 23 45 c for 2021 fig 1b the relationship between rainfall and temperature is weak r2 0 2148 indicating uncertain rainfall patterns fig 1b the low temperatures are experienced from december to late february during which the north east trade winds harmattan greatly influence the district in general high temperatures and low humidity caused by the dry harmattan winds favor high rates of evaporation and transpiration resulting in water shortages for both domestic and agricultural purposes loh et al 2020 the district is located in the interior guinea savanna woodland which could sustain large scale livestock farming as well as the cultivation of staples like rice groundnuts yams cassava maize cowpea and sorghum the trees found in the area are drought resistant and hardly shed their leaves completely during the long dry season most of these trees are of economic value and serve as an important means of livelihood especially for women notable among these are shea trees vitellaria paradoxa the nuts which are used for making shea butter and dawadawa parkia biglobosa which provides seeds used for condimental purposes 2 1 1 geological and hydrogeological settings the savannah region falls within the birimain and voltaian basin which covers more than a third of the total land area of ghana the birimain formation is of granitoids and volcaniclastics as seen in fig 2 while the dominant minerals are k feldspar and biotite table 1 the voltain formations consist of quartzite schist shale sandstone and conglomerate or pebbly beds baffoe et al 2018 the extensive sediment dominant area was about 265 92 km2 wacke which may have been formed from sedimentation and compaction although there are areas of uniform lithology interbedding of different lithological mineral compositions and the details are described in table 1 and fig 2 the study area encompasses about 1 8 of ghana s total land area fig 2 the lithological cover within this study area is unique and distinct compared to other areas because of the interbedding of different lithology these units are evident in the towns of damongo sawla larabanga and kulmasa along the major road linking the savannah region to the upper west region these units ancestry is of volcanic activities and hence consist of some meta volcanic units bruce et al 2009 these surface water systems are tributaries of the white and black volta borehole depths vary widely from 21 0 m to 99 0 m and yields range from 0 3 m3 h to 12 0 m3 h anornu et al 2009 bruce et al 2009 this can be attested to the partial weather depth of about 18 80 m fig 2 anku et al 2009 uncovered a positive correlation between borehole depth and yield while aquifer transmissivity in ghana among sandstones ranges from 0 1 to 52 0 m2 d siltstone and mudstone aquifers have transmissivity ranging from 0 2 to 16 0 m2 d anornu et al 2009 zango et al 2014 in general the voltaian aquifers in ghana have a strong relationship between aquifer transmissivity and specific capacity abdul ganiyu and prosper 2021 anornu et al 2009 the study area generally has groundwater suitable for domestic and agricultural use but some parameters like tds and ph make the quality poor loh et al 2020 this includes a low ph ranging from 3 5 to 6 0 and a high concentration of iron throughout the study area zango et al 2014 the majority of groundwater quality issues can be attributed to hydro geochemical processes in bedrock rock aquifers and anthropogenic activities resulting in high sodium chloride concentrations with thin overburden of about 5 m fig 2 2 2 choosing the groundwater influencing factors groundwater occurrence is associated with a wide range of factors which include geomorphology geology lineament density drainage density soil land use land cover curvature topographic wetness index rainfall slope and roughness abdalla et al 2020 díaz alcaide and martínez santos 2019 omolaiye et al 2020 however this study selected factors like geology lineament density rainfall slope drainage density soil and land use land cover lulc as the main controlling determinants of groundwater occurrence in the study area the main focus of the study is to use quantum gis with analytical hierarchy process ahp in the assessment of groundwater potential in the savannah region of ghana the essence of using qgis over other gis environments is because qgis is an open source program and hence has better performing algorithms used in groundwater assessment that are free and accessible 2 3 data collection and processing a review of literature has shown that researchers across the globe have adopted the use of different models in assessing groundwater potential and they include frequency ratio elvis et al 2022 guru et al 2017 oh et al 2011 weights of evidence chen et al 2018 rane and jayaraj 2022 artificial intelligence alqadhi et al 2021 chen et al 2020 hakim et al 2022 machine learning arabameri et al 2021 kalantar et al 2019 lee et al 2020 logistic regression fadhillah et al 2021 nguyen et al 2020 random forest and maximum entropy kalantar et al 2019 rahmati et al 2016 and support vector machine farzin et al 2021 naghibi et al 2017 however the use of ahp has been in several studies hussain et al 2015 othman et al 2020 and specifically in groundwater assessment arulbalaji et al 2019 ifediegwu 2022 rahmati et al 2015 sapkota et al 2021 this study employed ahp because of its resilience in handling complex decisions in groundwater assessment firstly the soil and geological data were acquired from the regional office agricultural departments but these data were in a shapefile format these data were converted from shapefile to raster formats using the feature conversion tools moreover a total of 157 gps points were picked and 34 points were augured in the sawla tuna kalba to validate the soil map in the study area the lineament complexes were extracted from the dem srtm dataset 30 m using the pci geomatica program the complexes were built using the hill shade tool with the azuthimal combinations of 315 45 200 50 160 60 and 50 90 this was to extract the different levels of fractures because smaller fractures may not be visible in the 315 45 combinations the fractures were drawn by creating a new shapefile line and the density was produced using the line density tool in arcgis the lineament density was assigned a weight of 0 2397 due to the influence of infiltration and deep percolation the lineament density is simply the total length of lineaments per unit area eq 1a in kilometer square km km2 magesh et al 2012 1a lineament density le a where le is the total length of lineaments in the study area and a is the area data used to develop the drainage density map was acquired through the usgs website www eathexplorer usgs gov dem srtm image of 30 m resolution the drainage density was produced using the tools flow direction stream accumulation stream feature and stream order the density eq 1b is given as the total length of rivers and streams per the unit area rane and jayaraj 2022 1b drainage density ls a where ls is the total length of rivers and streams in the study area and a is the area the slope was produced using the same dem srtm 30 m data with the help of the slope tool the drainage density was assigned a weight of 0 057 because of the low impact of drainage on the groundwater potential the lulc in this study is considered a very important factor because studies have reported the impacts of land use change on groundwater quantity and quality pandey et al 2020 tadese et al 2020 this study collected 411 ground truthing points of different lulc features on the field see figs 3a g with a gps garmin gpsmap 62sc out of the 411 points 55 polygons were created with each polygon containing an average of 10 points as used in the classification process one of the focuses of this study was to evaluate the accuracies of lulc classification algorithms since lulc is the main component of groundwater assessment the general assumption is that low accuracy in lulc maps affects the final accuracy of the groundwater potential map and vice versa however in using a high performing classification algorithm like support vector machine svm and random forest rf specific lulc classes can be mapped with high precision and accuracy these lulc classes are often inseparable from one another like grassland riparian vegetation open and close savannah woodland therefore it is imperative to subject the lulc to different algorithms in qgis to assess the overall accuracies the sentinel 2a satellite image of 17 02 2022 was downloaded from www eathexplorer usgs gov for the lulc classification the essence of this satellite imagery was because of its 10 m resolution band 2 3 4 and 8 compared to landsat 8 modis lidar and many more the description of the different lulc classes table 2 was captured using a drone dji it was observed that the major farming system practice in the study area is agroforestry where trees are either grown or left within the farms to provide shed and fruits this system of farming is very crucial because it compensates for trees lost due to deforestation and bush burning 2 4 analytic hierarchical process ahp ahp is one of the commonly used multi criteria decision analysis techniques in the field of agricultural environmental hydrological and groundwater studies rahmati et al 2015 analytic hierarchical process ahp which was originally proposed by saaty 1977 was used in this study to assign weights to each determinant spatial layers in this process a pairwise comparison matrix is generated by comparing the assigned scores for each layer the scores are generally assigned between 1 equal importance to 9 extreme importance saaty 1987 in the ahp model a pairwise comparison matrix for the 7 layers was created taking into account the importance of each layer to groundwater occurrence see supplementary data table 7 the normalized weights of the individual layers were created using the eigenvector method the weight of each determining factor is derived from the maximum eigenvalue in the normalized eigenvector in the pairwise comparison matrix as seen in table 3 the reliability of the judgment is dependent on the consistency ratio cr and its value must be less than or equal to 0 1 in case it exceeds this limit it is suggested to revise the process again until consistency of 0 1 is achieved and the consistency was within a 0 1 limit in this study the cr was computed using eq 2 2 cr ci ri where ri is the random index and ci is the consistency index and was computed using eq 3 3 ci λ max n n 1 in this equation λ is the principal eigenvalue of the matrix and n is the number of factors used in the estimation saaty 1987 groundwater potential zones were derived from 7 spatial layers integrated into the qgis and arcgis environment to compute the groundwater potential index gwpi this is done by the weighted linear combination wlc as suggested by malczewski 1999 seen in eq 4 4 gwpi w 1 m j 1 n w j x i here gwpi is the groundwater potential index xi is the normalized weight of the ith feature of the thematic layer wj is the normalized weight of the jth thematic layer m represents the total number of themes and n is the total number of classes in a theme however this phenomenon in arcgis uses the overlay tool while eq 4 is practical in qgis using the raster calculator geology had the highest weight of 0 279 followed by lineament density with 0 2397 justified by the nature of the birimian supergroup and intrusive rocks present in the study area fig 2 where fracturing plays a significant role in groundwater recharge 2 5 overlay analysis after the weights of the selected layers were determined each layer lulc soil slope geology lineament density drainage density and rainfall was reclassified into four 4 classes of natural breaks the essence of reclassifying the layers was to ensure that they carry the weights in the overlay analysis if the layers are not reclassified the computed weights would not be applied the reclassified layers were uploaded into the qgis 3 16 environment and the raster calculator was used to multiply the weightage assigned by each corresponding layer to produce the groundwater potential map seen eq 4 this technique is quite different from the usual overlay analysis in arcgis which requires loading the layers using the overlay tool in the arc tool box and assigning the weights 2 6 hydro geophysical assessment of groundwater potential cross validation a geophysical survey is considered laborious time consuming and expensive in the absence of reliable background information and sometimes fragmented data findings from this work would provide enough information on the groundwater potential in the study region using qgis remote sensing while lifting the load on geophysical survey in groundwater exploration this study deployed geophysical techniques to investigate groundwater occurrence in the study area to complement results from the groundwater potential map the choice of any geophysical method depends on the purpose and geological setting present cheng et al 2019 lin et al 2018 the different hydro geophysical techniques include electrical resistivity electromagnetic induction gravity seismic and traditional methods abidin et al 2011 rolia and sutjiningsih 2018 taha et al 2021 this study adopted the use the electrical resistivity in five communities gbenyiri changbalayiri kaawie korle and monah because it is the most common and effective method used in africa mesbah et al 2017 mohamaden et al 2016 2 7 electrical resistivity method vertical electrical sounding vertical electrical sounding ves is a technique used for investigating geological mediums based on the electric current produced sarpong asare and menyeh 2013 there are several configuration arrays used when considering electrical resistivity methods for groundwater exploration namely wenner schlumberger dipole dipole and dipole pole aizebeokhai 2010 the dipole dipole method was employed because of its ability to probe deeper and studies have shown its accomplishments with regard to borehole drilling in northern ghana sarpong asare and menyeh 2013 the abem terameter module sas 4000 was used to measure the resistivity of the geological formation while probing for the occurrence of this resource the dipole dipole array configuration shown in fig 4 was used in detecting the groundwater resistivity while the apparent resistivity was computed using the geometric factor k the average profile length was about 170 m to allow for deeper probing and readings were picked at 5 10 m intervals profile interval the data were analyzed using microsoft excel 2016 it was used to plot resistivity against profile interval regions of low resistivity played a huge role in choosing points for drilling purposes for groundwater decision making and cross validate results from the groundwater potential map 5

groundwater recharge to assess the potential of groundwater resources across the globe it is important to investigate the natural recharge and hence this study sought to estimate the recharge that contributes to the groundwater reserve natural recharge occurs as precipitation or surface water infiltrates into the soil through the pores down to the water table this study acquired daily precipitation data from the ghana meteorological service within the study area from 1981 to 2021 studies have adopted developed models like swat khoi et al 2022 and mudflow jang et al 2016 hassan and khalaf 2020 but little has been done using direct estimation to ascertain the exact recharge using this method oke et al 2013 this study adopted the chaturvedi formula eq 6 to compute the groundwater recharge due to rainfall while the volume was computed using eq 7 6 r 2 0 p 14 0 4 for p 400 mm 7 ra 2 0 p 14 0 4 area where r net recharge due to precipitation in mm ra net recharge due to precipitation in cubic meters and p annual precipitation in mm chaturvedi 1973 derived an empirical relationship based on water level fluctuation and rainfall amounts to estimate groundwater recharge as a function of annual precipitation in mm the formula was applicable in areas that receive annual precipitation of more than 400 mm this study applied this relationship to the rainfall data obtained between 1981 and 2021 to compute the groundwater recharge due to rainfall also the standard error se was estimated to give a close certainty of the estimated recharge with eq 8 8 se σ n where se is the standard error σ is the standard deviation and n is the number of years 3 results and discussion 3 1 determining factors of groundwater potential in this study the factors considered to influence groundwater occurrence include lulc soil slope rainfall lineament density drainage density and geology these factors were thoroughly investigated to determine the spatial availability of groundwater in the area and similar factors have been used according to literature david ndegwa kuria 2012 ifediegwu 2022 kalantar et al 2019 3 1 1 land use land cover lulc map the lulc classification yielded eight classes in the study area fig 5 this study tested the accuracies of three classification algorithms svm rf and gmm but rf had the highest overall accuracy 93 63 and kappa coefficient 0 94 compared to the other algorithms table 4 several studies have reported that svm has high accuracy however this study found rf to have high accuracy which is consistent with studies rahman et al 2020 roy 2021 the eight 8 lulc types were bare land 6 54 km2 water bodies 3 31 km2 riparian vegetation 40 23 km2 grassland 773 33 km2 close savannah woodland 2555 02 km2 cropland 335 43 km2 open savannah woodland 238 83 km2 and settlement 271 16 km2 the relationship between groundwater and vegetation rv gl cswl and oswl cannot be underestimated because deep rooted tree species dominant in the study area like mahogany swietenia mahagoni baobab adansonia digitata dawadawa parkia biglobosa ebony diospyros ebenum and shea vitellaria paradoxa taps into the groundwater reserve and also serve as cover mulch to reduce groundwater losses through evaporation umar et al 2009 the lulc was assigned a weight of 10 28 because the major effect on groundwater is rapid urbanization because the population rise in the savannah region from 2010 to 2021 was about 71 905 people however the settlement was found to be 271 16 km2 these statistics indicate the pressure that would be mounted on water resources especially groundwater and the need to conduct this research prabhakar and tiwari 2015 in a study around madhya pradesh found that areas with high settlements have low groundwater potential due to industrialization and urbanization whereas areas with thick vegetation would have high groundwater potential due to high infiltration and percolation thick vegetation in this area was 2555 02 km2 findings from this study are similar to studies by prabhakar and tiwari 2015 due to the same lulc types hence vegetation is an important component in determining groundwater occurrence elmahdy et al 2020 liaqat et al 2021a 3 1 2 lineament density the geological lineament was found to range from 0 157 to 0 785 km km2 fig 6 geological lineaments are indicators of deeper earth structures fractures faults joints fractures with obvious displacements ruptures with no fractured displacements that are not visible to the naked eye hussein et al 2018 and the weight of 23 97 was assigned the link between groundwater availability and lineament density cannot be undermined since these features determine the amount of groundwater within an area david ndegwa kuria 2012 high groundwater occurrence in a region can be associated with high fracture density within the basement rock however high density was found in some areas with high yielding boreholes areas with lineament density ranging from 0 314 to 0 7847 km km2 indicate high fractures which are potential groundwater zones the study area is underlain by crystalline hard rock fig 2 and groundwater can only exist if there are interconnected fractures adam and appiah adjei 2019 in this study geological lineament had the second highest weight because groundwater in the study area is primarily defined by fractures which are consistent with results from the field works it was evident that some drill wells showed artesian properties as a result of high fracturing and atmospheric pressure yusof et al 2011 3 1 3 rainfall fig 7 shows the annual rainfall distribution in the study area and it was found to range from 798 02 mm year to 1471 9 mm year rainfall plays an important role in determining groundwater potential zones because it is the primary source of natural recharge which leads to aquifer productivity rainfall is the natural source of recharge but this would depend on effective percolation rainfall that contributes to groundwater recharge which also depends on several factors like lulc soil and slope hence in the pair wise ranking it was assigned a weight of 11 81 however studies show that the study area has experienced extremely heavy rainfall loh et al 2020 areas with high rainfall and vegetative cover result in high infiltration and deep percolation resulting in the natural replenishment of groundwater whereas areas with low rainfall and no vegetation would result in low infiltration and hardpans which retarding groundwater recharge liaqat et al 2021b murthy and mamo 2009 prabhakar and tiwari 2015 fig 7 shows that the northern part receives more rainfall compared to the other areas 3 1 4 lithology the geological map fig 8 shows that the birimain supergroup accounts for approximately 3355 km2 of the area voltaian units account for 3 km2 and the mesozoic was found to have an area of 77 km2 eburnean was 380 km2 and the tamnean units account for about 412 km2 the geology in the study area was assigned the highest weight of about 27 because of its importance to groundwater occurrence the study area consists primarily of metamorphic and sedimentary rocks which are reported to have high groundwater yield chernet 1993 in terms of lateral inflows lithological units are the host of pathways for groundwater the regolith and fractures on the other hand are the primary groundwater holding and transmitting zones meanwhile areas with good fractured systems may have low groundwater potential in completely weathered formations as a result the geological in the study area are crucial determinants in unearthing regions of high potential for exploration purposes the birimian covers about 74 of the country s landmass and is of particular interest to the water economies of the rural population in ghana yidana et al 2012 although the birimian serve as prolific aquifers for most domestic groundwater exploration they are highly variable they are generally discontinuous and localized due to the complexity of the geology hence would determine the availability of groundwater potential these rock types have low intrinsic primary porosity and permeability except in areas with some weathering or fracturing due to secondary activities these areas showed high electrical resistivity values during the hydro geophysical assessment justifying the weight assigned these weathered or fractured zones govern the aquifers hydrogeological environment producing substantial yield where there are interconnected fractured zones 3 1 5 soil the dominant soil types in the study area are depicted in fig 9 while the areas of each soil type are shown in table 5 it was found that the soil classes consist of two or more types of soil this is because during the field survey it was found that each soil class contains proportions of different soil types as seen in fig 9 soil is a critical factor in controlling the rate of infiltration and runoff which is important for groundwater replenishment also soil types influence crop suitability water holding capacity and soil nutrients in the context of irrigation weathered soils sandy loam would have high porosity and permeability which are good for infiltration whereas clay soils would have low infiltration soil types like vertisol fluvisols and gleysol would have a low affinity for infiltration and hence would lead rainfall to runoff while soil types like plinthosol lixisols and luvisols will lead to high infiltration generally it was found that 56 21 of the land area would allow infiltration which is a pathway for groundwater recharge therefore a weight of 8 25 was assigned for that reason soil type is regarded as a major factor in determining zones of good groundwater potential pandey et al 2020 3 1 6 drainage density fig 10 shows that the drainage density ranges from 0 0748 to 0 763 km km2 indicating that the area of interest aoi is reasonably drained and thus a good region of groundwater occurrence the stream channel is commonly used to assess the productivity of a watershed this thematic layer is of moderate importance compared to the other 6 layers because high drainage density would depend more on soil geology lulc and rainfall and hence was assigned the lowest weight 5 70 this property is important in investigating groundwater potential zones because a good drainage system influences percolation and leads to groundwater replenishment regions of this activity are potential areas of groundwater occurrence and for this reason some boreholes along the white volta the boundary between the study area and cote d ivoire were highly productive areas with drainage densities ranging from 0 203 to 0 7631 km km2 have a good drainage system depicting good potential zones a similar study by tolche 2020 in the dhungeta ramis sub basin ethiopia reported drainage density values ranging from 0 3410 to 0 5669 km km2 the values in this current study are higher compared to that of tolche 2020 3 1 7 slope the slope in the study area was expressed in meters as shown in fig 11 the slope ranges from 164 9 m to 377 7 m recent studies have shown that regions characterized by high elevation hilltops are likely to have a low groundwater occurrence while regions with low elevation may have high groundwater occurrence abebrese et al 2022 bhowmick and ojha 2019 ganapuram et al 2009 magesh et al 2012 nguyen et al 2020 a borehole on top of a hill is considered to have a low yield while valley areas may be good groundwater zones generally groundwater resources with high yields are found within valley areas wei et al 2019 this is because gentle slopes have the affinity of holding runoff for a long period to facilitate groundwater recharge this study found that high slopes in the study area are undulating and have the propensity of accommodating groundwater within the valleys the slope gradient is an important factor in determining the movement of groundwater abdalla et al 2020 adeyeye et al 2019 alipour et al 2018 the topography is also evident in the contours and shows that areas of closed contours are consistent with areas of high slopes and consistent with excellent groundwater zones see fig 9 from fig 11 it can be noticed the closed contour lines within the mid section of the study area are primarily dominated by the tamnean plutonic units fig 8 which are associated with high groundwater potential because of its primary and secondary porosities also these are comparable to regions dominated by lixisols fig 9 that would allow high infiltration slope influences rainfall infiltration directly and is regarded as the main factor in determining groundwater potential al saud 2018 this can also be used to show the point of groundwater recharge or flow in a specific basin gupta and srivastava 2010 and this phenomenon is useful in groundwater harvesting 3 2 groundwater potential zones the different zones of possible occurrences and quantities of groundwater in the study area are presented in fig 12 the groundwater potential was classified into low moderate high and excellent classes these classes were classified based on ariel coverage viz low potential regions comprise 229 53 km2 moderate zones comprise 1700 62 km2 high potential zones comprise 2135 04 km2 the largest in terms of land stretch and excellent potential areas were found to be 152 14 km2 this study is consistent with abdalla et al 2020 abebrese et al 2022 adeyeye et al 2019 arulbalaji et al 2019 azma et al 2021 david ndegwa kuria 2012 doke et al 2021 ifediegwu 2022 kumar et al 2018 magesh et al 2012 oh et al 2011 rahmati et al 2015 these case studies reported groundwater potential ranges from low to high with high potential being the least in terms of ariel coverage fig 12 shows that the sawla tuna kalba area has a high groundwater potential which can be exploited to supplement domestic and agricultural especially irrigational activities a majority of this resource falls within the moderate to high groundwater zones this zone is predominantly made up of intrusive rocks of the birimian eburnean and tamnean plutonic suites fig 8 which are of particular importance to the water economies of ghana obuobie and barry 2010 the granite intrusive rocks are not inherently permeable but rely on secondary porosities through fracturing and weathering for groundwater recharge from the results higher lineaments densities are characterized in fig 12 as regions of moderate excellent groundwater potential and this can be attributed to the fracture densities within the tamnean formation fig 8 from fig 12 borehole points 93 were overlayed on the groundwater potential map and 11 of them disagreed with the model while 82 agreed based on high yielding boreholes found at low potential areas and low yielding boreholes were also observed at regions of high potential also the validation results showed that areas with moderate high potential areas are suitable for deep seated wells such as boreholes because of the formation it was further observed that areas with low potential are dominated by shallow and hand dug wells which yield enough during the rainy season but dry up during the dry season this phenomenon can be noticed in fig 9 where low potential areas in fig 12 correlated with areas dominant with stagnosols and planosols which are possible zones of perched aquifers these findings imply that this kind of aquifer would occur in the rainy seasons since groundwater can only be stored in the intermediate soil layers and the subsurface 3 3 cross validation of the gis model ninety three 93 borehole yield data obtained from the water resources commission of ghana were used in cross validating the output of the groundwater potential map generated the contours were based on the assumption that the higher the contour density the higher the groundwater potential from the analysis fig 13 it was observed that the borehole yield obtained related to the groundwater potential map generated a majority of the high yielding boreholes fell within the high to excellent groundwater potential areas suggesting confirmation of the results high to excellent potential areas may be suitable for deep seated wells whereas shallow and hand dug wells may be suitable during the rainy season for low potential areas results from the test wells confirm that the groundwater potential in the study area is significantly high and borehole discharges ranging from 17 to 530 m3 day satisfy the essence of the cross validation the transmissivity results are used to explain an aquifer medium s ability to transmit water through it and thus the results obtained suggest that the three geologic media can transmit a large amount of groundwater up to 210 m2 day which is consistent with previous studies abdul ganiyu and prosper 2021 it is therefore appropriate to say that results from the pumping test and the overlay analysis confirm the possibility of groundwater exploration is not far fetch with the required management and sustainability practices 3 4 hydro geophysical survey results the geographical settings of all the 13 points picked in this study are presented in table 6 but the locations of the five 5 studied communities are seen in fig 12 from the survey it was found that the studied communities showed high groundwater occurrence which shows that the groundwater potential map from this study can be used to reduce the burden on geophysical survey in the study region findings from the analysis showed that low resistivity points between 0 2 and 203 ωm were the preferred areas of groundwater occurrence and also research has indicated that low resistivity regions ranging from 0 1 to 1024 4 ωm are good groundwater points bayewu et al 2018 duc vu et al 2021 resistivity is inversely proportional to porosity rolia and sutjiningsih 2018 and hence low resistivity is equal to high porosity and high groundwater potential also resistivity is inversely proportional to hydraulic conductivity seidu et al 2019 and therefore low resistivity would indicate high groundwater occurrence from figs 14a to c it was noticed that resistivity ranges from 0 038 to 264 ωm high resistivity in groundwater geophysics ranging from 200 to 1000 ωm values is attributed to dry soils at near surface or fresh bedrock suryadi et al 2020 while very low values of less than 0 2 ωm suggest the presence of clay deposit benoit et al 2019 moreover the high resistivity values 264 ωm in fig 14a found in this study can be linked to the high tension power line by the road while fig 14b 109 ωm and 14c 100 7 ωm may be connected to the compact soils from fig 14a the groundwater points were picked and labeled ves ga 30 and ga 90 with the resistivity of 177 ωm while ves ga110 was 40 ωm table 6 these analysis are consistent with abd el gawad et al 2018 mohamaden et al 2016 riwayat et al 2018 sunkari et al 2021 but omolaiye et al 2020 in a study in nigeria that found groundwater resistivity range from 103 to 180 ωm which can be as a result the similarities lithology the observation from fig 14a is comparable to figs 14b 14c and 14e except fig 14d this is because at korle two 2 profiles were taken as seen in fig 14d in the first profile very high resistivity values were measured at a distance of 120 m hence another profile was taken and similarities from the first profile were evident in the second the groundwater resistivity values from the first and second profiles were 423 ωm ves ka 30 and 744 ωm ves kb 130 respectively the details pertaining to resistivity in each community are seen in supplementary data tables 1 5 the values recorded were very high compared to other resistivity values from the other communities and this can be evident from the fractured and massive exposed rocks within the community in the second profile field experience played an important role because the negative resistivity points were presumed dry clay zones and hence resistivity values of 744 ωm suggest that the present rock is either fractured or permeable suryadi et al 2020 while high resistivity values in surface rocks is a function of high fractured density sunkari et al 2021 two 2 out of the thirteen 13 points taken were drilled and this was done in two communities gbenyiri ves ga 110 and korle ves ka 30 after the loggings it was observed that the average drill depth was 75 m and the yield was 125 l min the first layer which was about 5 m thick was mainly laterite shallow plinthosols while between 10 and 25 m were made up of weathered granitoid which are consistent with the lithology in fig 2 and fig 8 however between the lateritic layer and the partially weathered granite there was some wetness observed which correlates to soil type fig 9 which consists of the deep fluvisols and vertisols the results pertaining to borehole success and performance are seen in supplementary data figs 1and 2 3 5 groundwater recharge in the hydrologic cycle rainfall and groundwater recharge are considered among the important components because of their direct relationship khoi et al 2022 fig 15a shows the annual groundwater recharge between 1981 and 2021 in the study area it was observed that the highest recharges were in 1981 and 2012 within an amount of 33 22 0 35 mm and 32 59 0 35 mm respectively while the least was observed in 2002 with an amount of 23 45 0 35 mm in 1981 and 2012 the annual rainfall was found to be 1139 06 and 1085 33 mm respectively while in 2002 the annual rainfall was found to be 485 16 mm as seen in fig 15b and the other years are presented in the supplementary data table 6 and 7 this analysis indicates that the groundwater recharge within the study area is largely influenced by the annual rainfall and hence the higher the annual rainfall the higher the recharge and vice versa this relationship is seen in fig 15a which shows a strong correlation between rainfall and recharge r2 0 997 meaning rainfall is dependent on recharge also the standard error was estimated to be 0 35 mm suggesting that annual recharge varies plus or minus 0 35 mm more importantly it was found that about 2 85 of the total annual rainfall is converted to groundwater recharge this rate is comparable to studies by dekongmen et al 2022 that modeled the groundwater recharge rate to be 1 65 using qswat in the afram plains of ghana the difference in the rate may be associated with the high temporal variation in the savannah region and the surface geology the total groundwater recharge due to rainfall in 2021 was 30 18 0 35 mm 12 7 mm3 but the total recharge between 1981 and 2021 41 years was found to be 1191 18 0 35 mm 5031 4 mm3 fig 15b also shows the relationship between annual rainfall and annual groundwater recharge it was found that in periods of high annual rainfall high groundwater recharge is obtained also this analysis primarily shows that high rainfall areas are associated with high groundwater recharge therefore from fig 7 it was observed that the northern part of the study area received a high amount of rainfall and can be further observed that the northern part of groundwater potential map shows high potential as seen in fig 12 in summary it can be concluded that the validity of the groundwater recharge rainfall and groundwater potential in this study area is at an acceptable level 4 conclusion the use of remote sensing and some grounding methods to examine groundwater potential has grown in popularity in recent years and it can help to reduce the burden on geophysical study results presented in this study indicate high groundwater occurrence which can be extracted to an appreciable level with the right management practices the regions of groundwater occurrence were found to varied from low zone areas which comprise 229 53 km2 moderate zones comprise 1700 62 km2 and high potential zones comprise 2135 04 km2 the largest in terms of land stretch and the area with excellent potential was 152 14 km2 also from the hydro geophysical survey it was observed that low resistivity regions are zones of possible groundwater occurrence except for korle which showed high resistivity as a result of the surface geology pumping test results from boreholes were found to have a high yield ranging from 20 to 350 m3 day which suggests that the occurrence of groundwater in the area is irrefutable also values on transmissivity indicate that the aquifer medium has a high tendency to transmit water through it and hence the focus of this study can be considered analyzed the groundwater recharge due to rainfall computed indicates that an average of 2 85 of the total annual rainfall goes to groundwater recharge with a variation of 0 35 mm the highest recharge was observed in 1981 33 22 0 35 mm and the lowest in 2002 23 45 0 35 mm while the total recharge between 1981 and 2021 was 1191 18 0 35 mm a little above average 56 21 of the study area would allow infiltration into groundwater which is largely attributed to the characteristics of the soil type this result shows that the groundwater recharge due to rainfall in the study area is high and also attests to the fact that groundwater potential in the study area is high funding not applicable credit authorship contribution statement
